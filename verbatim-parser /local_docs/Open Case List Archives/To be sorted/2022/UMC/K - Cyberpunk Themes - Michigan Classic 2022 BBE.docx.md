# Cyberpunk Themes w/ Camp K's

## General

### Origin/AT: Other Cyberpunk

#### Cyberpunk and the New Wave era are intrinsically tied -- need to incorporate previous arguments instead of breaking radically

**Lantham 20 \--**the author of Consuming Youth: Vampires, Cyborgs, and
the Culture of Consumption (2002) and the editor of The Oxford Handbook
of Science Fiction (2014) and Science Fiction Criticism: An Anthology of
Essential Writings (2017). He was, for two decades, a senior editor of
the journal Science Fiction Studies (Rob, "Literary Precursors," *The
Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture*, Chapter 2, p14) //le

In sum, and contra the claims of critics such as Pfeil and Bukatman,
**[[cyberpunk owes a significant debt to the New Wave
era]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As stories such as Brunner's, Tiptree,
Jr.'s, Galouye's, and Silverberg's clearly show, sf of the 1960s and
1970s had already begun to develop a number of the major pillars of the
cyberpunk worldview, [[from]{.mark} [the conviction that]{.mark}
[information technologies would **radically reshape global society** to
the belief that **capitalist forms of commodification and control would
inevitably channel this process toward profitable ends**. The **biotech
assault on centered subjec- tivity**]{.mark} mounted by classic
cyberpunk was also powerfully prefigured in New Wave treatments of
**[proto-VR technologies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with their ability to
project artificial environments and thus shatter and remold the
perceiving self. [A careful comparison of key New Wave and cyberpunk
texts is likely to elicit as many similarities as
differences]{.underline}: Even the 1960s obsession with "inner space" is
echoed in Gibson's famous evocation of cyberspace as a "consensual
hallucination" (67), and the hard- boiled textures and tones of the
1980s were adumbrated in Tiptree, Jr.'s wise-cracking style and
Silverberg's cynicism. [[Seeing the two movements as radically
opposed]{.mark}---or, as I put it in a previous essay, "focus\[ing\] on
rupture at the expense of continuity" (45)---thus ignores the ways in
which the sf mode actually grows and evolves: **[not by breaking
radically with what has gone before but by adapting and refashioning
past achievements into new and compelling forms.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### Generic Impact

#### 4 Impacts: cybercrime, cybogrized lifestyles, elimination of reality, abandoning of mortal "meat"

**Lantham 20 \--**the author of Consuming Youth: Vampires, Cyborgs, and
the Culture of Consumption (2002) and the editor of The Oxford Handbook
of Science Fiction (2014) and Science Fiction Criticism: An Anthology of
Essential Writings (2017). He was, for two decades, a senior editor of
the journal Science Fiction Studies (Rob, "Literary Precursors," *The
Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture*, Chapter 2, p8) //le

In fact, [[four key cyberpunk themes were foreshadowed]{.mark} in
specific works of the New Wave era: (1) **[the emergence of an
information economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with all its complex impact
on the social order, in particular the spread of cybercrime and forms of
info-warfare; (2) [the [resultant hypercom- modification of culture and
the attendant growth in **cyborgized lifestyles**]{.mark}; (3) the
**[proliferation of synthetic realities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to the
point that simulated experience has begun to supplant the real thing;
and [(4) the [possibility of a transhumanist "uploading" of
consciousness, allowing individuals to **abandon the mortal
"meat**]{.mark}**"**]{.underline} in favor of a virtual existence as
discorporate data. [All of these themes are perceived as
quintessentially cyberpunk, yet all were powerfully prefigured---indeed,
basically crystallized---in important sf works of the 1960s and
1970s.]{.underline}

### Continuous Evolution/Co-Opts

#### Capitalism coopts cyberpunk through creating marketable products -- extension and revision key to evade

**Kilgore 20 \--** currently serves as special programs coordinator for
Teaching & Learning Innovation at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville. He has published on cyberpunk, narrative theory, and graphic
narrative. In his spare time, he maintains an online fantasy novel
system, The Adasir Project (www.adasir.com). (Christopher D., "Literary
Precursors," *The Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture*, Chapter 7,
p48) //le

By the end of the 1980s, **[[cyberpunk risked becoming a pastiche of
itself or, worse still, merely one more marketable
produc]{.mark}t]{.underline}**. As Andrew M. Butler argues in Cyberpunk,
"[the cutting-edge nature of cyberpunk ensured that it rapidly became a
cliché]{.underline}: like many avant-gardes, it was obsolete as soon as
the mainstream media took notice" (43). Butler's assessment is
reinforced by multiple claims that [**[rapid commodification had
effectively killed cyberpunk as the 1990s
dawned]{.underline}**.]{.mark}1 At the same time, [cyberpunk tropes
remain resilient in science fiction, giving rise to a new label---
post-cyberpunk---whose short- and long-form fictions contribute to
cyberpunk's thematic arcs. In their collection]{.underline} Rewired: The
Post-Cyberpunk Anthology, James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel explain
that post-cyberpunk builds upon cyberpunk's initial obsessions: "some
writers extend them, some react against them, some take them for granted
and move the basic attitudes into new territories" (x). For example[, [a
**"key insight of**]{.mark} **CP** \[[cyberpunk]{.mark}\], [extended
still further in]{.mark} PCP \[[post-cyberpunk\], is that we are no
longer changing technology; rather **it has begun to change
us**]{.mark}" and "[human values are not imprinted on the fabric of the
universe because what it means to be human is always
negotiable]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Kelly and Kessel x, xi). At the same
time[, the "punk in post- cyberpunk continues to make sense if it is
pointing toward an attitude: **an adversarial relationship to consensus
reality**"]{.underline} (Kelly and Kessel xii). Post-cyberpunk therefore
represented an expansion of cyberpunk beyond the initial literary forms
embodied by the fictions of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, or Lewis
Shiner; post-cyberpunk's emergence in the 1990s was fostered by social
milieus and climates that increasingly resembled the cyberpunk that had
emerged a decade earlier but was now fast becoming quotidian reality. In
particular[, post-cyberpunk extends and revises core cyberpunk concerns
in its handling of (dis)embodiment, online realities, networked
subjectivities, and techno-biological viruses.]{.underline}

#### Snowcrash shows the evolution of Cyberpunk -- interaction between language and code

**Kilgore 20 \--** currently serves as special programs coordinator for
Teaching & Learning Innovation at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville. He has published on cyberpunk, narrative theory, and graphic
narrative. In his spare time, he maintains an online fantasy novel
system, The Adasir Project (www.adasir.com). (Christopher D., "Literary
Precursors," *The Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture*, Chapter 7,
p48-49) //le

While critics point to a host of authors,2 Neal Stephenson quickly
emerged as one of the most prolific and important figures associated
with post-cyberpunk, particularly given the immense success of Snow
Crash (1992), an influential novel that played a pivotal role in
transforming lit- erary cyberpunk and popularizing post-cyberpunk. At
its most basic level, Snow Crash delivers cyberpunk's tropes of virtual
spaces, techno-biological viruses, ambivalence about embodiment, and
hacker heroes with a hefty dose of enthusiastic, playful irony. The
novel embraces the flashy, stylish, surface-oriented features of
cyberpunk, while simultaneously undermining them as al- ways already
amenable to commodification. The novel's protagonist, dubbed Hiro
Protagonist, caricatures the elite hacker (anti)hero and yet still
functions in traditional hacker-hero fashion, saving the world from L.
Bob Rife, televangelist, oil baron, and the novel's obligatory megaloma-
niac. Finally, Stephenson's portrayal of the near-future U.S. parodies
cyberpunk's urban sprawls

with the brilliant neon 'loglo' of the multinational 'franchulates' into
which society has devolved, articulating a scathing anti-capitalist
satire in the process---yet also deploying, in support of Hiro, the
outsized corporate figureheads of Cosa Nostra Pizza's Uncle Enzo and Mr.
Lee of Mister Lee's Greater Hong Kong. [[Snow Crash shares with the
tradition of postmodernist parody]{.mark} the propensity toward
simultaneously critiquing and embracing materialism and
commodification]{.underline}.3 The paper- back jacket copy sums up Snow
Crash's post-cyberpunk approach in one blurb: "[[Cyberpunk isn't
dead---it has just]{.mark} (belatedly) **[developed a sense of
humor."]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Snow Crash was both intellectually stimulating and fun---and as much as
it provided a rollicking adventure story[, it also presented cyberpunk
more as a way of approaching and understanding hu- man experience than a
set of easily commodified tropes and motifs.]{.underline} The novel
carries out this shift in stance through its transformation of core
cyberpunk concerns. First, Stephenson's depiction of the online
Metaverse reworks the central trope of cyberspace, in sharp contrast to
Gibson's early vi- sion. Whereas Gibson's Sprawl trilogy (Neuromancer
\[1984\], Count Zero \[1986\], Mona Lisa Overdrive \[1989\]) envisions
an instrumentalized cyberspace, rendered in basic geometric shapes that
represent a complex file system[, Stephenson envisions a livelier and
more heavily populated environment that has more in common with the
visual-aural language **of first-person or role-playing
games.**]{.underline} That is, Gibson's system of representation has
been supplanted by Stephenson with a more polyvocal simulation. Second,
no one in Snow Crash seems able to encode a mind directly into the
Metaverse (as in Gibson's Neuromancer or Rudy Rucker's Software
\[1982\]), nor do they want to[. Stephenson therefore appears to side
with common critiques of early cyberpunk's ambivalence (if not outright
rejection) toward embodiment. Instead, the novel fully embraces body
augmentation, or what Lisa Swanstrom calls a "networked" conception of
subjectivity (77). For Stephenson, [mind, brain, and body form a
**meaningful interactive process that collectively constitutes an
individual**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Stephenson explores this networked subjectivity in two key ways. First,
hacker elites like Hiro and his colleagues use digital technologies as
extensions of their perceptions and capacities, and in so doing render
themselves physically and mentally vulnerable to visual-textual hacking.
For example, Hiro's hacker friend Da5id is reduced to a persistent
vegetative state by the Snow Crash viral computer program. At the same
time, L. Bob Rife can physically hack people and infect them with the
DNA-based version of the virus, rendering them part of a larger cyborg
superor- ganism that unquestioningly follows Rife's programming.
[Stephenson therefore presents [not an opposition between the digital
and the 'meat' but rather a cultural system **vulnerable at all levels
to manipulation.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Snow Crash's complicated relationship to embodiment is also part and
parcel of Stephenson's re-conceptualization of viral infections, or
virality, which up to this point in cyberpunk were largely tools or
weapons. T]{.underline}he viral contagion deployed by L. Bob Rife,
however, is not a digital-age invention. Instead, [the Snow Crash virus
originates in Sumerian Asherah myths and in the connections that
language orchestrates between cognition and volition or
action]{.underline}. [Stephenson therefore projects [**the computational
logic of code onto the semantic system of language**, whereby human
discourse becomes as amenable to hacking as computer
networks]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the vector for dis- cursive virality,
he chooses revealed religion, the ecstatic tradition of glossolalia or
"speaking in tongues," an ecstatic eruption of syllables. As Snow Crash
depicts it[, this virality, built around the language-processing deep
structures of [the brain, **self-propagates** through human
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Stephenson therefore finds the Asherah
virus everywhere, including the temple prostitutes of ancient Babylon,
medieval Europe, and revivalist sects in modern America. Indeed, the
idea itself seems to operate virally for [Stephenson, who shifts in the
course of the novel from a conception of the virus as a self-propagating
entity to **[a conception that sees-as-viral almost everything about
human civilization.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Snow Crash therefore depicts both information and viral contagions as
free from any one me- dium, tearing virality loose from the digital
media that dominated (and limited) earlier cyberpunk.

Similarly, Stephenson's Metaverse constitutes a much more social space,
a playground for human discourse in all its historical and international
variety. Finally, concerns about embodiment take on an additional
dimension[: [**The networked human mind-body complex becomes
vulnerable**,]{.mark} in precisely the same way as systems of human
community become vulnerable to the Asherah virus.]{.underline}

Some regard the [1990s as the beginning of a 'post-cyberpunk' era, or a
moment when [the]{.mark} initial ideas, images, and [aesthetics of
cyberpunk became a **broadly recognized and shallowly commodified
style**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Booker and Thomas 117--18). Thomas Foster,
in contrast, suggests that during the 1990s cyberpunk experienced a
"sea-change into a more generalized cultural formation" that responds to
and reflects diverse conditions of social, technological, and economic
change much more broadly than the original close-knit cadre of cyberpunk
authors were able to imag- ine (xiv). [[Both of these
tendencies]{.underline}]{.mark}---the shallow commodification of
cyberpunk style and the use of recognizable cyberpunk sensibilities to
interrogate contemporary life---[[are present
within]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[mainstream superhero comics]{.mark} during the early
1990s]{.underline}. As Mark Oehlert observes, various cyborg heroes had
been appearing within mainstream comics since at least 1941, [when
Marvel created **Captain America**, one of the first genetically
modified 'cyborgian' superheroes]{.underline} (112). [Other [cyborg
figures]{.mark}---such as Iron Man (1963), Deathlok (1974), Rom (1979),
Cyborg (1980), and Cable (1990)---had appeared with increasing frequency
within mainstream comics since the 1970s]{.underline}, but it wasn't
until the early 1990s that mainstream comics truly started to explore
the terrain of cyberpunk. As Daniel Martin argues, for example, [**the
Marvel comic Spider-Man** 2099 (1992--96) "deploys the themes and tropes
of cyberpunk fiction in the service of a postmodern superhero nar-
rative"]{.underline} (467). Spider-Man 2099 was the most popular of a
wave of 2099 titles from Marvel (includ- ing The Punisher 2099
\[1993--95\], Doom 2099 \[1993--96\], and Ravage 2099 \[1992--95\]) that
were set in a grim, dystopian, cyberpunk future: "\[I\]n 2099, your
friendly neighborhood Spider-Man is a little less friendly. So is the
neighborhood" (qtd. in Martin 470). As Martin shows, [Spider-Man 2099
offers ambivalent portrayals of "**[genetic engineering, cybernetic
enhancement, and artificial intelligence]{.mark}**" and, like many other
cyberpunk texts, reflects a variety of "Orientalist cultural anx- ieties
and regressive gender codes]{.underline}" (466).

## Bio-Cyberpunk

### Link

#### Biopunk link: genetic modification is a pervasive technological invasion

**Schmeink 20 \--** is the project lead at the "Science Fiction"
subproject of "FutureWork," a research network funded by the German
Ministry of Education and Research. He was the inaugural pres- ident of
the Gesellschaft für Fantastikforschung from 2010 to 2019 and has
published extensively on science fiction and posthumanism. He is the
author of Biopunk Dystopias: Genetic Engineering, Society, and Science
Fiction (2016) and co-editor of Cyberpunk and Visual Culture (2018).
(Lars, "Biopunk," *The Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture*,
Chapter 10, p73) //le

While it is not quite clear when and where the term '[biopunk' was first
used, its heritage reflects two distinct traditions of literary science
fiction (sf): that of cyberpunk, on the one hand, and that of biological
sf, on the other]{.underline}.1 The latter, of course, is the far older
tradition, with biology provid- ing a "thematic emphasis emerg\[ing\]
very early in the development of science fiction" (Parker 35), including
such foundational texts as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818) or H.G.
Wells's The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896). [[The thematic focus of
biological sf most relevant to biopunk is genet- ics, whether genetic
mutation]{.mark} or "the feasibility and desirability of planned genetic
alteration"]{.underline} (Parker 35). [[Cyberpunk]{.mark}, the other
tradition informing biopunk, [plays]{.mark} directly [into]{.mark}
mainstream culture's scientific interest in genetics and the [issues
"**about the nature of life itself**, about what it is to be human,
about the future of the human race]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Reiss 13).
Many of cyberpunk's themes connect with biological sf. Bruce [Sterling,
for example, writes about [the loss of control by governments and big
corporations as technology is no longer a tool of those in power, but
**"visceral," "pervasive, utterly intimate**]{.mark}**"**]{.underline}
(Preface xiii). [Technology is for everyone to use and invades the minds
and bodies of cyberpunk society. By extension a central theme in
cyberpunk is that **the [borders of what consti- tutes the 'human' are
being crossed]{.mark},** blurred, or erased]{.underline}. For example,
in the documentary No Maps for These Territories (Neale 2000), Sterling
reminisces upon cyberpunk's earliest days: "We were able to make
computers glamorous. \[\...\] This was a supermodel among technologies.
\[\...\] They were going to be cute; they were going to be miniature;
they would be designed; they would be ador- able. The boundaries of the
human body would be crossed." Brian McHale notes that [[biopunk]{.mark},
just as cyberpunk, is founded upon the "centrifugal self" but in terms
of prominent themes ascribes to it the revision of "Gothic-horror motifs
of bodily invasion and disruption]{.underline}" (257). What differen-
tiates [biopunk]{.underline} from cyberpunk, therefore, is that it
[[deals with the hybridization of the human not with machinic elements
**but with other organisms**]{.underline}:]{.mark} human, animal,
bacterial, fungal, viral, and so on[. In biopunk fiction, the invasion
of the body is intimate and visceral as it takes place on the level of
the cell, or smaller still, on the level of the nucleotides that form
all living matter.]{.underline}

### Biopunk \> Cyberpunk

#### Biopunk overcomes the shortcomings of cyberpunk -- able to challenge environmental issues

**Schmeink 20 \--** is the project lead at the "Science Fiction"
subproject of "FutureWork," a research network funded by the German
Ministry of Education and Research. He was the inaugural pres- ident of
the Gesellschaft für Fantastikforschung from 2010 to 2019 and has
published extensively on science fiction and posthumanism. He is the
author of Biopunk Dystopias: Genetic Engineering, Society, and Science
Fiction (2016) and co-editor of Cyberpunk and Visual Culture (2018).
(Lars, "Biopunk," *The Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture*,
Chapter 10, p74-75) //le

As Thomas Foster has pointed out (and many of the entries in this
collection further demon- strate), [[cyberpunk needs to be viewed as a
**cultural formation** interacting with the
posthuman]{.underline}]{.mark}: it acts as "an intervention in and
inflection of a preexisting discourse, which cyberpunk signifi- cantly
transformed and broadened, providing a new basis for the acceptance of
posthuman ideas

in contemporary American popular culture" (Foster xiii).4 In spite of
its posthuman potential, however, cyberpunk often retains a humanist
subjectivity based on a position of human excep- tionalism and the
underlying idea that "there is a distinctive entity identifiable as the
'human,' a human 'self'" (Nayar 6). [[Cyberpunk]{.mark}, in many
instances, [depicts cybernetic technology as a means to]{.mark} enhance
humans and [**overcome "any number of natural human limitations** such
as aging, death, suffering]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Philbeck 175). As a
result, [cyberpunk's transhumanist concepts of cyborg enhance- ment, up
to its extreme position of uploading one's consciousness into fully
realized machine bodies, are ways to allegedly free humanity from its
biological limitations]{.underline}, or so the transhumanist arguments
go. The humanist self, though, is untouched by these enhancements,
transcending its bodily prison to consolidate its position of
exceptionalism.

Biopunk may therefore be a better vehicle for posthuman lines of inquiry
than cyberpunk; after all, [[cyberpunk's desire to transcend human
biology is a **"fantasy of escape**]{.mark}**"**]{.underline} (Braidotti
91) [and a "grafting of the posthuman onto a liberal humanist view of
the self]{.underline}" (Hayles 286--87). Biopunk, on the other hand, is
founded upon what Donna J. Haraway refers to as "to become with many"
(4). After all, Haraway reminds us that only 10% of the cells in a human
body consist of human ge- nomes, while "the other 90% of the cells are
filled with the genomes of bacteria, fungi, protists, and such, some of
which play in a symphony necessary to my being alive at all, and some of
which are hitching a ride and doing the rest of me, of us, no harm. I am
vastly outnumbered by my tiny companions" (3--4). [According to
Haraway's understanding, [human has thus always already been a
**hybridized existence**]{.mark}, inextricably linked to other
species]{.underline}. Therefore, biopunk powerfully ex- plores the
potential and the consequences that stem from this realization and best
embodies the idea of a hybridized and pluralized posthumanity
"constituted by and constitutive of multiple forms of life and machines"
(Nayar 2).

[Biopunk not only addresses the question of how the human relates to
other forms of life, but [it also **challenges human relations with the
environment**]{.mark}, with the world.]{.underline} Cyberpunk's
enclosures, zones, and virtual worlds are representations of the impact
of human technology, [their differences highlighting the fragmentation
of ontology into what McHale calls "multiple-world spaces]{.underline}"
(250). In other words[, our practices shape and form the world we live
in; culture and technology define the boundaries and makeup of our
world. In their focus on technologically shaped worlds, many cyberpunk
texts see the world]{.underline}, as Veronica Hollinger points out in
her contribution to this collec- tion, as defined by technology, [[with
**nature notably absent**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Simply put, issues of
human influence on ecology, or what is today referred to as the
Anthropocene, act merely as background noise and not as narrative
centers in cyberpunk. The scant attention paid to them lends credence to
Gerry Canavan's critique that cyberpunk has traditionally offered a
shortcut "for getting outside scarcity and precariousness---simply leave
the material world altogether, by entering the computer. In virtual
space, with no resource consumption or excess pollution to worry about,
we can all be as rich as we want for as long as we want (or so the story
goes)" (9).

[[Biopunk]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, [[highlights]{.mark}
the unrepresentability of the world, preferring to leave the scale of
the human behind to address [a **"grey ecology" which "propels us beyond
our own fin- itude**, opens us to alien scales of both being]{.mark}
(the micro and the macro) [and time]{.mark} (the effervescent, barely
glimpsed; the geologic, in which life proceeds at a billion year
pace]{.underline})" (Cohen 383). In other words, [[biopunk is an
**intervention** in the discourses of the Anthropocene]{.mark} by
exploring human life on a micro scale]{.underline}, the Harawayian
becoming-with of viruses and bacteria. At the same time, biopunk also
challenges our conceptions of life on the macro scale. For example, both
the retrovirus of "Our Neural Chernobyl" and the single-cell lifeforms
of Blood Music spread to all forms of life; their impact is global and
will be irreversible for the Earth as a whole.

### AT: Realism Good

#### Cyberpunk controls realism -- the integration of technology means their theories are wrong 

**Tomberg 20 \--** is a senior researcher of Contemporary Literature in
University of Tartu, Estonia. His research focuses on science fiction,
realism, utopia, and the philosophy of literature. His two monographs
focus on the poetics of Science Fiction, and his essay "On the 'Double
Vision' of Realism and SF Estrangement in William Gibson's Bigend
Trilogy" won the Science Fiction Research Association's Pioneer Award in
2014. He is the editor of the Estonian Avant Garde mag- azine Vihik and,
besides research, has written two plays. (Jaak, "Non-SF Cyberpunk," *The
Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture*, Chapter 11, p81-82) //le

During the first years of the 21st century history---or, more precisely,
[technological development--- finally seemed to have caught up with
cyberpunk]{.underline}. [The various [technological phenomena]{.mark}
and processes [common to cyberpunk]{.mark} increasingly [started to pop
up in everyday reality, including **virtual communication**
technologies**, digital networking**, and the emerging **social
media**]{.mark} plat- forms; advances in **genetic engineering** and
increasingly common **prosthetic supplementations to the body**; the
mediated intimacy of historical events and [the eventual emergence of
**cyber-war**]{.mark}; and the overall onslaught of the society of the
spectacle and the virtualization of finance capital.]{.underline}2 These
all became more evident, more strongly felt in quotidian late-capitalist
reality. In a way, several of cyberpunk's central speculative elements
seemed to have 'bled' straight from fiction into the everyday.

More important than the manifold materializations of cyberpunk's
particular thematic ele- ments, though, was the sheer speed and
intensity of overall technoscientific developments that brought them
about, and the corresponding over-accelerated pace of cultural change
felt in ev- eryday life. All of a sudden, [[change seemed to have been
the only constant of contemporary glo- balized
existence]{.mark}.]{.underline} And this, in turn, posed some novel
imaginative and representational problems to science fiction (sf) in
general and cyberpunk in particular.

That something was happening (or had already happened) with cyberpunk
became es- pecially evident after the 'realist turn' of one of its
central figures and founders, William Gibson. With his 21st-century
trilogy of novels (Pattern Recognition, 2003; Spook Country, 2007; Zero
History, 2010---collectively known as the Blue Ant trilogy) Gibson
forfeited his usual future-oriented cyberpunk extrapolations and started
writing contemporary novels that were situated in the immediate present
or recent past. As Brian McHale fluently summarized, [the protagonist of
Pattern Recognition "suffers jet lag, uses e-mail and Photoshop,
consults on the design of a corporate logo, goes 'cool-hunting' for
street fashions, encounters post-Soviet oligarchs, and becomes obsessed
with an online video clip"]{.underline} (182). No fully immersive
virtual realities, no artificial intelligences, and no technological
transformations of the body so com- mon to cyberpunk can be found---the
novels of the Blue Ant trilogy "are indistinguishable from contemporary
thrillers from the point of view of their plots and worlds" (McHale
183). In place of extrapolative projections of the future, [Gibson
offers us the realist cognitive mapping of the globalized
present.]{.underline}

In an interview given at the time, Gibson attributed his realist turn to
an imaginative deadlock provoked by the contemporary pace of change:

In the '80s and '90s---as strange as it may seem to say this---we had
such luxury of stability. Things weren't changing quite so quickly in
the '80s and '90s. And when things are changing too quickly, as one of
the characters in Pattern Recognition says, you don't have any place to
stand from which to imagine a very elaborate future. (Nissley)

[Gibson seems to suggest [**that the over-acceleration of the everyday
also affects the extrapolative imagination,** drawing the horizons of
futurity decisively close to the present]{.mark}]{.underline}. Several
commenta- tors on the contemporary status of sf have voiced concurring
statements. Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, quoting the feminist theorist Zoe
Sofia, has [characterized the contemporary situation as **"[the collapse
of the future onto the present]{.mark}"**]{.underline} ("Futuristic"
27), and added that "as [the transformations reach a certain pitch, the
very idea of transformation changes from mystical to statistical, from
transcendence to a selection of alternatives]{.underline}" (Seven
Beauties 58). In more genre-related terms, Veronica Hollinger has
usefully and plausibly argued that "science fiction is 'the literature
of change,' but change is exactly what now defines the present. It no
longer guarantees the future as the site of meaningful difference"
(453). [Pattern Recognition therefore seems to point to the possibility
that "science fiction's founding assumption---[that the future will be
different from the present---has become outdated. **Today the present is
different from the present**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Hollinger 465).
Thus, it wouldn't be too far-fetched to say that the technical
over-acceleration of the present also in a way makes it a
science-fictional one---and it is precisely this present, different from
itself, that informs the realist focus of Gibson's novels. No wonder
then that McHale noted the plots and worlds of the Blue Ant trilogy (as
well as some of the works by Neal Stephenson, notably Cryptonomicon
\[1999\] and REAMDE \[2011\]) are indistinguishable from contemporary
thrillers and the prose, "bristling with brand names, technical jargon,
specialized knowledge, and calculatedly strange juxtapositions,"
continues to read like sf, "testifying to the fact that our everyday
reality in the new millennium actually seems to have the texture of
science fiction" (183; see also Tomberg).

In other words, Gibson's realist prose focuses on the contemporary
globalized everyday and estranges in the same specific way that sf used
to estrange. [[The contemporary pace of change]{.mark}, together with
the technological saturation of the present, has thus **[also led to
changes in the con- temporary genre system]{.mark}**, and, more
precisely, to the relative positions [of **realism**]{.mark} and sf
therein.]{.underline} The underlying premise is that as the contemporary
late-capitalist cultural space-time has become increasingly
techn(olog)ical, its [**[realism]{.mark}**, aspiring towards credible
reflections of this space-time, **[has inevitably become increasingly
science-fictional]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since both Gibson and
Stephenson are closely associated with cyberpunk, and since the specific
tropes and thematic motifs that seem to have 'bled' from fiction into
reality are ones that feature most centrally in cyberpunk's repertoire,
it is fair to claim that of all the sub-categories of sf, [cyberpunk is
the one most directly involved in the current close feedback-loop
between realism and sf]{.underline}. In a sense, cyberpunk has by now
realized itself to such an extent that, to borrow a very attentive
remark from Sherryl Vint, [it would be more useful to see
[cyberpunk]{.mark} "less as a subgenre of science fiction and more as
part of the cultural milieu **that [informs our contemporary existence
of technologically mediated reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}["]{.mark}

(266--67). Vint de- velops this notion on Thomas Foster's claim that
(probably sometime during the 1980s and 1990s) cyberpunk
"experience\[d\] a sea change into a more generalized cultural
formation" (xiv). In an article on the convergence of virtual and
material battlefields in cyberpunk cinema, Vint coins a generic concept
for contemporary works that convey this cultural formation: non-sf
cyberpunk.3

### AT: Perm Do Both

#### Biopunk cannot utilize the government or big corporations -- gets co'opted

**Schmeink 20 \--** is the project lead at the "Science Fiction"
subproject of "FutureWork," a research network funded by the German
Ministry of Education and Research. He was the inaugural pres- ident of
the Gesellschaft für Fantastikforschung from 2010 to 2019 and has
published extensively on science fiction and posthumanism. He is the
author of Biopunk Dystopias: Genetic Engineering, Society, and Science
Fiction (2016) and co-editor of Cyberpunk and Visual Culture (2018).
(Lars, "Biopunk," *The Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture*,
Chapter 10, p77-78) //le

Taking up the critique voiced by these artists and turning it into
social activism is a loose group of DIYbio, biohackers, or biopunks
(self-proclaimed) that came together around the turn of the 21st century
and in "The Biopunk Manifesto" found a kind of philosophical treatise to
express their

values. Meredith Patterson, author of the manifesto and a computer
scientist, is seen as a leading figure in [[the biopunk
movement]{.mark}]{.underline} and approaches biology through its
connection with information technology---thus [conceptually [drawing a
parallel between cyberpunk and biopunk, between the]{.mark}
**[anti-authoritarian practices of hacking code and hacking
DNA]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Speaking for biopunk activism, [she demands
scientific research be open, free, and in the hands of the public,
arguing for empow- erment through "**scientific literacy**" and the goal
of "making the world a place that everyone can understand.]{.underline}"
In her manifesto, she explicitly states that [**engineers and
scientists** (professional or hobbyist) **[need to become political
actors and activists]{.mark}**]{.underline}, involved in policy
[becau[se both corpo- rations and politicians "wish to curtail
individual freedom of inquiry]{.mark}.]{.underline}" As such, DIYbio is
part of the movement toward open practices (i.e., open data, open
publishing, open education, open source, and open access), and
biohackers have joined with lawyers and social activists to fight, for
example, against the patenting of human genomic information or against
the restrictions of access to biological materials.

The biohackers and biopunks organized around "The Biopunk Manifesto" are
remarkably similar to Sterling's biohackers in "Our Neural Chernobyl":
[[They see the potential of biology for changing the world but
**refuse** to leave it in the hands of big science corporations or
govern- ment institutions]{.mark};]{.underline} they instead claim it as
a public good. [They are "the visionaries whose imag- inations were set
on fire by the knowledge that we had finally sequenced the human
genome]{.underline}" (Newitz). In their pursuit of knowledge, they do
not need the high-tech equipment of corporate laboratories, but rather
rely on "the hack"; or, as journalist Marcus Wohlsen has pointed out,
["\[b\]iohacking in the form promoted by DIYbio is about **engineering
elegant, creative, self- reliant solutions to doing biology while
relying not on institutions but wits**]{.underline}" (5). In this
utopian conception of biopunk, [[freedom of data, scientific method, and
research provide solutions to problems posed in medicine and
biology]{.mark},]{.underline} such as the hacking and curing of diseases
(through crowdsourcing its genetic deciphering) or the creation of
cheaper therapies (by decoupling them from corporate interests).

## Feminist-Cyberpunk

### General

#### Cyberpunk reimagining is a useful heuristic for analyzing the structures unpinning society 

**Yaszek 20 \--** is a professor of Science Fiction Studies in the

[[Women's interest in]{.mark} the organizing themes of
[cyberpunk]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[including **technoscientifically
induced alienation, corporate global domination, a rapacious media
landscape, and the often-reckless use of new technologies to transform
bodies and minds**---is as old as science fiction]{.mark} (sf)
[itself]{.mark}. The fury experienced by Mary Shelley's artificial human
in Frankenstein (1818) when he learns that he is the throwaway product
of bad science and bad parenting is every bit as charged as the
electricity that an- imates him]{.underline}. As such, Shelley
anticipates the dilemma of [cyberpunk's grifters, sex workers, and other
outsiders who eventually realize that they, too, are the **disposable
products of a technoscientific cul- ture**]{.underline}. As sf developed
into a unique popular mode with its own creators, publishing venues, and
rules for good writing, women began to explore the perils of capitalism
in greater depth. For example, both [Lilith Lorraine's "Into the 28th
Century" (1930) and Thea von Harbou's Metropolis (published as a novel
in 1925 and produced as a film by Fritz Lang in 1927) imagine futures
where **the [mad science of technologically reorganizing human life for
profit becomes standard practice]{.mark} in globe-spanning "Industrial
Dictatorships**"---and where women band together with each other and
fringe communi- ties [**of "reformers, scientists, and radicals"** to
change the course of history]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lorraine 257).

In the 1960s and 1970s, [women associated with the development of
feminist sf explored sim- ilar concerns in relation to new media
technologies, including television, early video games, and early
computers.]{.underline} Feminists writing proto-cyberpunk in this era
specifically envisioned "media

landscape" futures where [[everyday women undergo radically invasive
technological procedures to remake themselves in **the media's image of
feminine perfection**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Pringle and Nicholls).
Stories in this vein include Elisabeth Mann Borgese's "True Self"
(1959), Evelyn E. Smith's The Perfect Planet (1962), Kit Reed's "The New
You" (1962), Kate Wilhelm's "Baby, You Were Great" (1968), and, most
famously, James Tiptree, Jr.'s "The Girl Who Was Plugged In" (1973).
[Like Shelley's creature before them, **[the protagonists]{.mark} [of
these stories are monstrously alone, isolated from other women, and
alienated from the men who use them for profit]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Collectively, these authors insist that [there is no way out from the
media landscape because **[the forces of technologically-enabled
capitalism prevent women from connecting with one another in meaningful
ways.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### Timeframe (Solvency)

#### Revolution is a slow continuous process 

**Yaszek 20 \--** is a professor of Science Fiction Studies in the
School of Literature, Media, and Com- munication at Georgia Tech, where
she researches and teaches science fiction as a global language crossing
centuries, continents, and cultures. Her books include The Self-Wired:

[[Contemporary feminist cyberpunk's focus on familie]{.mark}s that
extend across time and space is [closely connected to its emphasis on
**slow revolution**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Chris Moriarty's Spin series
(Spin State, 2003; Spin Control, 2006; Ghost Spin, 2013) revolves around
the adventures of a far-future aug- mented human and her pansexual AI
lover as they negotiate the collapse of the human empire and the war
between various species for control of the future; at the same time,
Madeline Ashby's Machine Dynasty series (vN, 2012; iD, 2013, reV, 2015)
relates the multigenerational saga of a hybrid human-AI family that must
contend with a very real religious Rapture that changes the balance of
power between humans and machines on Earth. Nnedi Okorafor's The Book of
Phoenix (2015) does not provide much detail regarding the radical
changes that occur between the main action of the book (set in a
near-future much like our own present) and the frame narrative (which
takes place in a far-future post-oil society), but [the **very lack of
detail only underscores how long and complex** the process of change can
be]{.underline}. Such stories stand in sharp contrast to Cadigan's
Synners, where globe-spanning technological and economic networks are
destroyed and rebuilt in a matter of weeks, and Hopkinson's Brown Girl
in the Ring, in which the Canadian government is destroyed and rebuilt
in a matter of years[. While earlier generations may have envisioned
digital revolutions happening quickly because digital technologies were
themselves new phenomenon, [contemporary authors who have witnessed
multiple generations and iterations of digital technologies treat
**revolution as a slow process that takes place over great spans of time
and space.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Political Cuteness -- ALT?

#### Take back the Internet through political cuteness -- solves

Women and other feminist-friendly people put these insights to work in
both everyday practice and art. Kishonna L. Gray explains that
[[w]{.mark}omen [o]{.mark}f [c]{.mark}olor [use]{.mark} digital
[tech]{.mark}nologies and social media (such as 'Black Twitter') to
disrupt negative narratives of black femininity disseminated by the
mainstream media and "**[to capture the uniqueness of marginalized
women]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (176). They perform this double operation
by employing "diverse ways of speaking" and incorporating "music
\[\...\] poetry or spoken word \[\...\] or other cultural art forms in
their online lives" (187). Elsewhere, artists associated with the
Cybertwee Collective propose that [[women]{.mark} and other marginalized
people mi[ght **take back the Internet** by using tactics that have been
historically **devalued as "cute"**]{.mark} **or "femme":**]{.underline}

[\[F\]ar too long we have succumbed to the bitter edge of the idea that
power is lost in the sweet and tender\... **[sentimentality, empathy,
and being too soft should not be seen as weak-
nesses]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[\...\] [Our sucre sickly sweet is
intentional and not just a lure or trap for passing flies, [but a
**self-indulgent, intrapersonal biofeedback mechanism spelled in emojis
and gentle selfies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. (Emphasis added)

[[The Collective demonstrated the political potential of cuteness with
their 2015 Dark Web Bake Sale]{.mark}, which aimed to domesticate the
dark web]{.underline}---[a space notorious for both cybercrime and ram-
pant racism and sexism---by providing volunteers with \$15 of bitcoin
and instructions on how to spend it on cupcakes the collective sold
online.]{.underline} Much like their literary counterparts N.K. Jemisin,
Rem Warom, and Chris Moriarty, [[cyberfeminists associated with such
recent phenomena]{.mark} as Black Twitter and the Dark Web Bake Sale
[celebrate the kind of **"feminism at ease with
computation**]{.mark}**"** that has long been central to feminist
cyberpunk and that is increasingly part of all people's lives
today]{.underline} (Laboria Cuboniks).

## Janelle Monáe (afrocyberpunk)

### Alt -- Music

#### Embracing music to access different vibrations allows for challenging stereotype, critiquing history, and envisioning the future 

**Capetola 20 \--** is an Andrew W. Mellon Engaged Scholar Initiative

mobilizes sound and vibration as analytics for studying identity
formation and historicizing the recent past. She has an article on

Companion to Cyberpunk Culture*, Chapter 30, p246) //le

As one of our most exciting and thought-provoking contemporary artists,
[[Monáe creates her own black, queer, and feminist version of cyberpunk
through **interfacing her body and musical
technology**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} In the words of Shana L. Redmond,
[Monáe "uses her body to critique and resituate history, including the
identities produced from and within it]{.underline}" (394). By drawing
on the music of 1980s black pop stars, [[Monáe places herself within a
lineage of black artists who **use sound to in- tervene in stereotypes**
of black, female, and/or queer people]{.mark}---and to call attention to
the struggles of minoritarian subjects in America and the African
diaspora]{.underline}. Even more important, [[Monáe con- tinues the
trend of **pushing back on visual stereotypes of black people**]{.mark}
as criminals, welfare queens, or (art) objects]{.underline}---a
resistance that had begun with the work of MTV stalwarts such as Michael
Jackson and Prince. [Jackson and Prince were among the first black
artists to go into heavy rota- tion on MTV and the first pop artists of
any racial background to experiment with relatively new (at the time)
digital synthesizer and drum machine technology. **[Such experimentation
helped them re-humanize themselves]{.mark}** and citizens of black
communities as a whole in the face of dehumanizing images of black
people]{.underline} circulated during Ronald Reagan's presidency. Monáe
has continued this foundational work in her own oeuvre and the sonic
connections between Monáe's Dirty Computer and 1980s black pop stars
exemplify the resonances of 'history' in her present/future moment.

[Dirty Computer partakes in the cyberpunk---and also
Afrofuturistic---project of **[envisioning the future to reflect on the
present]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}5 In this vein, [Dirty Computer
works as a reflection of how black---and female, queer, trans, and
nonbinary---people continue to be objectified and policed in the
2010s]{.underline}. In the futuristic world of Dirty Computer, we
encounter many of the same technological and political problems
prevalent in today's America. During the emotion picture's opening,
[Jane narrates this dystopian setting: "They started calling us
computers. People began vanishing. And the cleaning began. You were
dirty if you looked different. You were dirty if you refused to live the
way they dictated. You were dirty if you showed any form of opposition
at all. And if you were dirty, it was only a matter of
time."]{.underline}

As they are captured, [the dirty computers are sent to a cleansing
center where their minds are erased memory by memory by a duo of white
men called "memory erasers]{.underline}," all while the androids strive
to keep their memories as a means of resistance. For example, one of
Jane's memories in- volves her and a friend in a car being pulled over
by an automated police drone floating through the air. As beacons of
surveillance, the drones are all-seeing, forcing the two women into
silence and stillness. Giving the automated surveillant some subtle side
eye as they produce their IDs and retinas to be scanned, they wait for
the drone to zoom out into the distance before letting the rest of their
friends out of the trunk, all while the song "I Got the Juice" begins to
play. After "I Got the Juice" abruptly stops, the scene shifts to one of
automated drones hovering above a group of dark- and light-skinned
people outside at night. While a voiceover reads from the Declaration of
Independence---"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit
of Happiness"---a row of people rocking piercings, asymmetrical
haircuts, and

gender nonconformity are lined up accordingly. This drone round-up
contrasted with the audio clip of the Declaration is a stark
visualization of who in this society is considered a dirty computer. In
the emotion picture[, music is the means by which Jane and her friends
attempt to [**find freedom**, to move to their own
beat]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, [[music allows them to exist
on a **different vibration**]{.mark} that is grounded not only in the
contributions of black culture but in solidarity with expansive notions
of queerness and feminism]{.underline}. As jazz composer, poet, and
Afrocentrist [Sun Ra remarked from the planet that he has set aside for
black people in the film Space is the Place (Coney 1974), "\[t\]he music
is different here. The vibrations are different on planet
Earth]{.underline}." In taking up Sun Ra's call to locate a different
'vibration' for a (black) collectivity, [[Jane and the other
androids]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[partake in the Afrocyberpunk project of **using (music) technology to
set themselves free.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

The potentiality of vibration and reclaiming technology remains tenuous
through the end of Dirty Computer. Before the credits roll, it appears
as if all has been lost: Zen, now a 'beacon' at the center, brings Jane
through the end of the cleansing process. After she has been made into a
beacon herself, Jane greets Ché, who has been strapped down to a table
in the cleansing center awaiting processing. But following the credits,
[vibration---and love---appears to prevail]{.underline}. The soundtrack
for this moment is "America," the final track on Dirty Computer and the
very song that Jane re- fused to forget while she was held captive. To
the lines of ["**[War is old, so is sex/Let's play god, you go
next]{.mark},**]{.underline}" we see Jane and Zen dragging Ché out of
the center. In sync with the synthesizer chords, they place their feet
one in front of the other as they move en route to their escape. After
the line "Jim Crow Jesus rose again," Jane smiles, remembering the
multiple times in the emotion picture when she completed the lyrics to
this line in protest---and was subsequently gassed with Nevermind in an
attempt to make her forget her love for Zen (and Ché) and the
possibility of a black, queer, and feminist collectivity. [To the sounds
of synthesizers making high-pitched 1980s synth sounds, Zen pushes open
the door of the cleansing center and leads the group into the
light.]{.underline}

[[It is therefore sound---and vibration---that ultimately brings the
trio **back into the light**]{.mark}. As the audio track proclaims "Love
me, baby/Love for me who I am" to the sounds of synthesizers that sound
like church organs]{.underline}, Jane stares out into the camera before
turning around and joining the others in their flight, letting the
sounds guide her. [She has not forgotten who she is]{.underline}---and
the vibrations of the song have helped her to hold on to what those at
the cleansing center have tried so forcefully to erase[. [In the tension
between human and machine, **love prevails**, albeit one that
does]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[not gloss over the dark side of technology and their being **embedded
within structures of white heteropatriarchal
capitalism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Francesca Royster asks through a
reading of Monáe's music at the end of her book on post-soul black
sounds, "\[h\]ow do we keep creating a future that includes all of us?"
(191). Through a mobilization of the Afrocyberpunk potential of digital
music technology, [[**Monáe offers us a way to imagine a solidarity**
among blackness, queerness, and femaleness that locates points of
overlap among all three while simultaneously holding onto the beautiful
differ- ences]{.mark} that distinguish us as people---and androids---in
the first place.]{.underline}

#### Pop music can break through discourse and everyday practices to build collectivity

[The genius of Dirty Computer is that it uses [pop music to **visually
and sonically situate histories of black suffering** within a context of
struggles for widening understandings of gender and sexu- ality]{.mark}
beyond the purview of sterile and respectable whiteness]{.underline}.
Through mapping the sounds and vibrations of pop music onto
Afrocyberpunk aesthetics, [[Monáe emphasizes how racial minorities and
androids who are categorized as 'other' can turn their]{.mark} **being
read as (or [being]{.mark}) [queer and gender non-normative into a
mechanism for building collectivity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Both
androgyny and queerness have always been part of the mix for Monáe, as
evidenced by the shouts of "Queer!" during the chorus of her 2013 single
"Q.U.E.E.N." and her later confirmation that she identifies as
pansexual. For example, using repurposed James Brown-styled dance moves
to try to escape her jailers in the music video for "Tightrope" (2010),6
[[Monáe challenges the dominance of the guards' white maleness and
**underscores femaleness and queerness as critical elements of black
musical traditions and black life**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Royster 188).

Given these intersectional interests, [Dirty Computer is optimistic that
**[pop music]{.mark}---i.e. poptimism--- [can work as a catalyst for
change in the world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The emotion picture
challenges the gender ste- reotypes that have been grafted onto musical
genres, beginning with [**the assumption that pop is more 'feminine'
than rock**---and therefore the politically weaker of the
tw]{.mark}o.]{.underline} In a 2014 op-ed, critic Saul Austerlitz
bemoans that poptimism (versus rockism) favors "disco, not punk; pop,
not rock; synthesizers, not guitars; the music video, not the live
show," adding that "\[i\]t is to privi- lege the deliriously artificial
over the artificially genuine." But rather than reinforcing the "de-
liriously artificial," [[Monáe mobilizes both pop and the technology of
synthesizers **to expose the behind-the-scenes workings of the memory
erasers**]{.mark} that keep white heterosexist patriarchy
alive.]{.underline} In addition to challenging the black masculinist
tendencies attributed to James Brown and other artists creating music at
the intersections of rock and funk,7 [Monáe utilizes pop music technol-
ogies on Dirty Computer to accentuate how **[blackness is constructed by
discourses and everyday practices]{.mark}** while simultaneously using
these same technologies to explore how gender and sexuality complicate
notions of blackness which are still too much indebted to
heteropatriarchal and het- erosexist tendencies. In other words**, [pop
on Dirty Computer is a site where Monáe can reimagine race, gender, and
sexuality.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### Communication

#### Music is an effective method of communication -- Dirty Computer proves

mobilizes sound and vibration as analytics for studying identity
formation and historicizing the recent past. She has an article on

To accompany the release of her new audio collection Dirty Computer
(2018), Janelle Monáe released a concept film---what she refers to as an
emotion picture--- of the same name that son- ically and visually
recounts how [Jane 58721 (Janel[le Monáe) and her android friends
attempt to hold onto their feelings (of **black solidarity, of feminist
collectivity, of same-sex desire**) in the wake of a white-washed ruling
power]{.mark} that wants to render them all **complacent**---and
emotionless--- machines]{.underline}. In what we can call an example of
'Afrocyberpunk,'1 [Dirty Computer is Monáe's fusion of cyberpunk visuals
and 1980s pop sounds to inspire us to act in the present and **build a
different future** than the dystopian one portrayed in the
film]{.underline}. In so doing, [[Dirty Computer centers black- ness and
the African diaspora as a pivot point for **pushing back against the
technological grip of a hyper-globalized society**]{.mark}, and although
they are considered 'dirty computers,' Jane and her friends utilize the
technologies of black musical traditions to continuously display the
'human' desires for sex, love, and connectivity]{.underline}. For
example, during the performance of "Django Jane," Jane 58721 sits atop a
throne dressed in a regal maroon suit, white shirt, black tie, white
leather boots, and maroon kufi cap with gold embroidery; a cohort of
black lady androids with black leather jackets and sunglasses layered
atop similar outfits surround her, supporting her regal position. The
group nods along as Jane raps, "Yeah, yeah, this is my palace/ Champagne
in my chalice," alluding to both the queens and kings of African history
and the power of global collectivity rooted in shared experiences of
blackness. The androids move their machinery along with the beat,
connecting with the felt oscillations of sound that are the song's
vibrations. After lifting their arms in the air, they quickly pull them
back down to their right in the fashion of a militaristic salute. [Using
the hard-hitting synthesizer and drum machine sounds as catalysts for
movement, they invoke Janet Jackson's "Rhythm Nation" (1989), the black
pop star's successful single on which she calls her fans to "**[Join
voices in protest to social injustice/A generation full of courage, come
with me]{.mark}**."]{.underline} For Monáe, ["Django Jane" highlights
**how [vibration is a source of identity-making]{.mark}** that works
both in conjunction with and in excess of sound to create points of
connectivity that push on the limits of visual representation. [Through
being drawn into movement along with the oscil- lations of a sound's
vibrations, they channel the fluidity of identity formation into the
project of history-making]{.mark}]{.underline} (Capetola 4).

#### Cyberpunk and posthumanism combine to challenge what it means to be human -- new cognitive technologies can challenge health span, cognition and emotion capabilities

[[What contributes to cyberpunk's ongoing importance is without question
its capability to put the idea of an **original human essence to the
test**]{.underline}]{.mark}; this applies to the cadre of Movement-era
authors1 in the 1980s onwards. [[Cyberpunk shows bodies and minds that
are constantly alter]{.mark}ed, enhanced, or perverted by bio- and
nanotechnological prostheses, cognitive implants, and/or new orifices
that interface with digital networks and cyberspatial domains. [The
definition of what it means to be human becomes **slippery in cyberpunk
as categories of identity, nature, and essence crumble**]{.mark}:
everything is interdependent, in flux, and defined rather by what it
does than what it is]{.underline}. Closely linked to cyberpunk's
emergence comes the advent of what is loosely called [the posthuman, a
concept which focuses on the same central themes---the amalgamation of
bodies and technology, brain-machine interfaces, and potential habitats
for humans in virtual spaces and space colonies]{.underline}. Various
writers, cultural theorists, and philosophers have been conceptualizing
what posthuman bodies in an increasingly posthuman present and future
could and should look like. [It is therefore imperative to identify and
differentiate the two major strands of understanding the posthuman that
not only set different priorities but contradict each other in
fundamental assumptions: trans- humanism and critical
posthumanism.]{.underline}

First, [[transhumanism is all about **transcendence**]{.mark}. The
prefix is short for 'transitional human,' an intermediate stage of human
development into]{.underline}, at some future endpoint, the posthuman.
Transhumanists put forth the freedom of the human individual to
technologically alter their cor- poreal body---referred to as
"morphological freedom" (More 4)---through prosthesis, but more often
through speculative bio- and nanotechnology. In this respect, one of the
main goals is the extreme postponement or even abolition of death.
"Becoming posthuman," argues Max More in "The Philosophy of
Transhumanism," "means exceeding the limitations that define the less
desirable aspects of the 'human condition'" (4). [[Posthuman beings
would not only "no longer suffer from disease, aging, and inevitable
death]{.mark}," but would "have vastly greater physical capability and
freedom of form"]{.underline} (More 4). Furthermore, More explains
[transhumanists "typically look to expand the range of possible future
environments for posthuman life, including space coloniza- tion and the
creation of rich virtual worlds"]{.underline} (4). Moreover[,
transhumanists extrapolate that [**new cognitive technologies will not
only enhance human capabilities to think and remember,** but also to
feel]{.mark}. Nick [Bostrom]{.mark}, one of the most prominent voices of
the transhumanist movement, [identifies **health span, cognition, and
emotion**]{.mark} as the three areas where posthuman capacities,
"greatly exceeding the maximum attainable by any current human being
without recourse to new technological means,"]{.underline} [should be
developed]{.underline} (28--29). Together with intellectual capacity and
"the capacity to remain fully healthy, active, and productive, both
mentally and physically," Bostrom

stresses that "the capacity to enjoy life and to respond with
appropriate affect to life situations and other people" would be
ameliorated (29). In sum, [transhumanist discourse sees becoming
posthuman as akin to the transition from childhood to adulthood as a
logical next step in human evolution]{.underline} (Bostrom 42).

Critical posthumanism is quite unlike transhumanism as it tells
completely different stories about posthumans. Primarily, it does not
presume that posthumanity exists in the near or far future; rather,
[critical posthumanism presumes we have already become posthuman and in
part asks how we arrived at our posthuman condition,]{.underline}
exemplified by N. Katherine Hayles's How We Became Posthuman: Virtual
Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics. In the tradition of
Michel Foucault, who stresses in The Order of Things that our orders of
knowledge are socially con- structed, [[posthumanists]{.mark} such as
Hayles [emphasize that our system of beliefs, our epistemes, shape the
world]{.mark}, not only on a metaphysical but also on a material level.
Foucault calls Man "**[an inven- tion of recent date]{.mark}**" that
will eventually be replaced by other ideas and constructs, "**[erased,
like a face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea]{.mark}"**]{.underline}
(387). Posthumanism therefore draws on this insight to resituate liberal
humanism as merely one story or invention among others. In this vein,
Donna J. Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto" tells a different story, [[a
story of **dethroning Man from his privileged position**]{.mark} as
crown of creation; it is a story against anthropocentrism and in favor
of the relatedness of humans, animals, machines, and other non-living
earth dwellers]{.underline}. The ability to tell 'different stories'
opens up the possibility of thinking about the emergence of new
technologies in tandem with a critique of humanism.

As a result, while [[transhumanists understand the term 'posthuman' as
referencing something that comes after the human,]{.mark} for critical
posthumanists it connotes the concept of something that comes after
humanism]{.underline}. Transhumanism, as More points out, "continues to
champion the core of the Enlightenment ideas and ideals---rationality
and scientific method, individual rights, the pos- sibility and
desirability of progress" (10). It can thus be understood as a
"contemporary renewal of humanism" (Sorgner and Ranisch 8) or even
conservative "retrohumanism" (Clarke xiv). In contrast, [critical
posthumanism challenges these Enlightenment ideas and ideals and the
anthro- pocentrism they are based upon, and insists on "the urgency of
finding new and alternative modes of political and ethical agency for
our technologically mediated world"]{.underline} (Braidotti 58).

## Gothicism 

### General 

#### Gothicism and cyberpunk are compatible

**Heise-von Der Lippe 20 i**s an assistant lecturer with the chair of
Anglophone Literatures at the University of Tübingen, Germany. Her
research focuses on the parallels between monstrous corporeality and
monstrous textuality, as well as the intersections of the Gothic and
critical post- humanism. Recent publications include her co-edited
collections Posthuman Gothic (2017) and Literaturwissenschaften in der
Krise (2018). She is one of the series editors of Challenges for the
Human- ities for Narr, Tübingen. (Anya, "Gothicism" The Routledge
Companion to Cyberpunk Culture, Chapter 32, p264) //le

[[Gothic textuality]{.mark}, Fred Botting argues, [is "\[u\]nstable,
unfixed and ungrounded in any reality]{.mark}, truth or identity other
than those that narratives provide, \[and\] [there emerges a **threat of
sublime excess**, of a **new darkness of multiple and labyrinthine
narratives**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (181). [[Cyberpunk]{.mark}, as a more
recent, but related narrative mode [focusing on the celebration of a
kind of **"urban uncanny**]{.mark}**"**]{.underline} (Schmeink 25) or
techno-sublime, was aesthetically influenced by earlier forms. Its
defining com- bination of "low life and high tech" (Ketterer 141) draws
on a wide variety of conventions, mixing dystopian and science fiction
(sf) elements with film noir and hard-boiled detective fiction, freely
combining cybernetic high-tech elements and abject Gothic body horror
with postmodern pop culture and futuristic architecture into a unique
aesthetics. [[At the core of both the Gothic and cyberpunk lies a
**fascination with spaces**]{.mark}---virtual or imagined---and the way
these are shaped by and, in turn, influence cultural ideas]{.underline}.
It would be tempting to read cyberpunk's fascination with the imaginary
architectural patterns of the urban 'Sprawl' (see Gibson) as simply a
new take on the Gothic sublime; after all, the flickering lights and
screens of late-capitalist advertising, which are integral components of
cyberpunk, suggest a mere surface aesthetic[. [Cyberpunk texts, however,
often revolve around a much **deeper posthuman and ultimately quite
Gothic integration of bodies and technologies**]{.mark}**,** undermining
and shaping our understanding of what it means to be human.]{.underline}

#### The combination of Gothicism and cyberpunk is a useful heuristic to challenge Anthropocene capitalism 

**Heise-von Der Lippe 20 i**s an assistant lecturer with the chair of

[[Recent cyberpunk narratives reflect scientific research into longevity
and the possibility of overcoming the limitations of the human
body]{.underline}]{.mark}. In consequence, [they often foreground
**[death as a liminal state to be overcome by technology, but in a
climate of Anthropocene capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, they do so on
a much larger scale, reflecting contemporary concerns with the death of
whole populations[. In these texts Gothic imagery of death, decay, and
abjection is used to underline a critical point which goes beyond the
vision of earlier cyberpunk texts like Blade Runner and
Neuromancer.]{.underline} These cybergothic texts draw on critical
posthumanist discussions of death as a global issue connecting north and
south in a framework of institutionalized necropolitical exploitation of
marginalized bodies at the hands of greedy global corporations. As
Braidotti argues by drawing on Achille Mbembe's concept of
"necropolitics" (Mbembe 11), "[[the bodies of **the empirical subjects
who signify difference**]{.mark} (woman/native/earth or natural others)
[have become the disposable bodies of the global
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Braidotti 111). Blade Runner 2049
reflects this by showing an orphanage

sweatshop in which a uniformly clad army of pale children with shaved
heads disassemble used consumer electronics, presumably to recycle their
components.5 [[The atmosphere of the scene is **clearly
Gothic**]{.mark}---from the gloomy architecture of the vast space to the
unsmiling children as uncanny doppelgangers. It is, clearly, not
personhood which is at stake for this collective body of children, but
rather [the underlying question whether any of them **will survive this
environment,** which considers **their "wasted
lives"**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bauman[**) [as less valuable than the
electronic trash they are]{.mark} [sorting]{.mark}.** [Their
absorption]{.mark} into the "integrated circuit" (Haraway 291) of
production and recycling of high-tech consumer goods [has certainly led
to a **kind of cyborgization and the dissolution of gendered
markers**]{.mark} (along with any other signs of
individuality)]{.underline}. The scene, however, presents a
techno-capitalist dystopia, a bleak distortion of Haraway's liberating
cyborg myth in which the status of the superrich "depends on the
material deprivation of others" (Frase) and automation technology
benefits only the rich.

#### Cybergothicism spotlights how technoscienctific creation destabilizes our sense of self, origin, and purpose

**Heise-von Der Lippe 20 i**s an assistant lecturer with the chair of
Anglophone Literatures at the University of Tübingen, Germany. Her
research focuses on the parallels between monstrous corporeality and
monstrous textuality, as well as the intersections of the Gothic and
critical post- humanism. Recent publications include her co-edited

[This kind of **[abject body horror]{.mark}**, which [casts the human
body **as soulless raw material**]{.mark} for bio-technological
experiments, can be traced back to Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein]{.underline} (1818). As Veronica Hollinger argues, in
contemporary re-readings[, Shelley's novel "has been transformed into a
precursor text of cyberculture"]{.underline} (192). Dongshin [Yi, for
instance, reads [Frankenstein as a key text in the Genealogy of
Cyborgothic]{.mark} \[sic\], as Victor Frankenstein's "**[workshop of
filthy creation]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Shelley 32) conjures questions
of creation and (identity) production, as well as creative and nar-
rative authority. Shunned by society and abandoned by his creator,
Frankenstein's creature ulti- mately begins to reflect on his existence
and the manner of his creation---a query mirrored in the novel's
epigraph from Milton's Paradise Lost (1667): "Did I request thee maker
from thy clay to make me man? Did I solicit thee from darkness to
promote me?" [The novel, like its cybergothic descendants, draws
attention to how **[the infinite possibilities of technoscientific
creation tend to destabilize human individuality and our sense of self,
origin, and purpose]{.mark}** to the point where we begin to question
our concept of humanity as a rational, clearly demarcated
species]{.underline}. [Cyber- gothic texts, from Frankenstein's
proto-posthuman Gothic explorations of these questions on- ward, take
these **[destabilizations and anxieties and aestheticize them to create
fully fleshed (or bio-technoscientifically engineered) monstrous
hor]{.mark}rors**]{.underline}. As Cavallaro argues, "the bodies that
populate these worlds are themselves intrinsically uncanny \[\...\]
threshold phenomena precariously suspended between materiality and
immateriality" (172) Cavallaro associates this liminality of cyberpunk
bodies with Gothic forms of embodiment: "An intricate and befuddling
incarnation of often repressed desires and fantasies, the Gothic body
eludes labelling and its appeal is accordingly

complex. Above all, it is boundless[; this condition is most famously
epitomized by the formless pulp of the unfinished female creature that
Dr Frankenstein ends up scattering over the floor of his
laboratory"]{.underline} (172).

## Baudrillard

### General 

#### Baudrillard and cyberpunk theory are intertwined

**Haar\* and McFarlane\^ 20 \--** \*received her Ph.D. from the
University of Tübingen, Germany. She conducted research on simulation
and virtuality in theory, as well as technology and media
representations in postmodern society. She studied modern German
literature, media studies, and musicology. Aside from media history,
media, and film theory, her areas of research comprise game studies and
comic studies. \^ is a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow at Glasgow
University with a project entitled "Products of Conception: Science
Fiction and Pregnancy, 1968--2015." She has worked on the Wellcome
Trust-funded Science Fiction and the Medical Humanities project and
holds a Ph.D. from the University of St Andrews on William Gibson's
science fiction novels. She is the editor of Adam Roberts: Critical
Essays (2016) and has served as blog and reviews editor for the journal
BMJ Medical Humanities. (Rebecca, Anna, "Simulation and Simulacra" *The
Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture*, Chapter 31, p255-256) //le

Perhaps [the most important voice in theorizing the entanglement of
ontology, reality, virtuality, and simulation is that of Jean
[Baudrillard]{.mark},]{.underline} [whose work intertextually influences
cyberpunk at some of its key moments and even **[acts as a kind of
cyberpunk theory, blurring the lines between the fiction and its
commentary,]{.mark}** the territory and the map]{.underline}.
Baudrillard's key text is Simulacra and Simulation in which he develops
some of his most important concepts, including that of the hyperreal.
Baudrillard argues that we are living in an increasingly mediated world,
constructed

of simulations and simulacra: [While simulations are intended to
represent or to copy objects or systems, simulacra are simulations with
no corresponding original]{.underline}. By drawing attention to the
proliferation of simulacra and their impact on the human mind,
[[Baudrillard's work suggests a dystopian society as **humans live under
the illusion that they are engaged with some kind of 'truth'**]{.mark}
when actually there can be no access to such a thing in our so-called
reality; in fact, 'truth' cannot exist in our current state, an idea
that rings increasingly true in the era of fake news, false accusations
of fake news, and the proliferation of conspiracy theories via social
media]{.underline}. Rather than merely predicting a future dystopia,
[Baudrillard's work argues that dystopia had already been realized at
the time of writing. He coins the term 'hyperreality' to describe this
society in which simulacra shape the human life world]{.underline} and a
pretense at a reference to reality is no longer required. [Baudrillard's
work resonates with the almost-contemporaneous development of cyberpunk
as a cultural mode: [While some cyberpunk grappled with the new
frontiers represented by cyberspace, Baudrillard **saw VR technology as
the acceleration of the destruction of the real** by its hyperreal
double ]{.mark}]{.underline}[(]{.mark}Perfect Crime 47).

#### We are reaching the hyperimmersive stage of reality where the power to code and control remains unevenly distributed

[[**Cyberpunk texts use technological simulations in order to analyze**
the increasingly mediated and hyperreal nature of our
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}, but in the meantime, [[technology has
been catching up]{.mark} to the science-fictional
imaginary]{.underline}, albeit sometimes in unexpected ways. At the
beginning of the 2000s, VR barely had any cultural sway but since then
games have tried to bring players into a virtual world, as far as the
technical possibilities allow. The development of the Internet as an
encompassing space thanks to WiFi and satellite navigation technologies,
a development that some sf writers (and readers) anticipated but could
otherwise barely have been imagined in the 1990s,

makes VR possible as an everyday technology. In this context [[the 2000s
can be thought of as a **cultural turning point from a medial
society**]{.mark}**,** one in which re[ality was shaped and constructed
through the media, **to a digital society**]{.mark}]{.underline}, one in
which digital technologies allowed new possibilities for active user
participation while also excluding such participation through the hidden
work done by inaccessible coding. [The move from the medial to the
digital required a change in user behav- iors, as humans learned to
navigate the new digital landscape]{.underline} (or were left behind by
it[), as well as economic responses as digitization affected industries
(and nations) of all kinds]{.underline}. Digitization was not so much a
goal as a tool, but a tool that enabled new forms of work and changed
communi- cation through new information technologies, enabling the
emergence of new networks as well as the exacerbation of social
cleavages, notably in the socioeconomic divisions impacting social
classes vis-à-vis access to technologies and the friction caused by
First vs. Third World geopolitics that has repeatedly seen the
technological wonders of the former predicated upon the cheap, if not
exploitive, labor of the latter.

[[The (de)evolution from a medial society to a digital one is now being
supplanted by the next stage]{.mark}.]{.underline} Gundolf Freyermuth,
for example, argues that [the increasing use of VR marks a further
cultural shift: **[the hyperimmersive turn]{.mark}**. In current VR
technology, simulation and reality are clearly distinguishable, but the
higher degree of immersion and the tendency towards augmented or mixed
reality are already becoming apparent]{.underline}; for example, data
glasses are being marketed that are increasingly within financial reach
for the average user, mobile phones can now be used as windows into VR,
and an online presence is presumed for everything from headhunting and
job applications to tax filings. Tellingly, [[hyperimmersion, like
digitization, raises the problem of that which is **hidden from end
users**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thorsten Holischka points out that [the
current generation is growing up with technologies that were not
considered possible a decade ago and that such widespread use is only
possible when technologies are made available without the need for
special knowledge]{.underline} (32). It seems that [the more widespread
a technology, the more reliant it will be on a user interface that is
welcoming to inexperienced users while, at the same time, hiding the
digital language that structures the user experienc]{.underline}e. As a
result, [**[the power to code and control networked or virtual
environments remains unevenly distributed]{.mark};** even in the
relative infancy of VR technol- ogy, cyberpunk acts as a discourse for
thinking about these problems.]{.underline}

#### In a technological world, a meaningful identity is impossible to inhabit

Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture*, Chapter 31, p260-261) //le

[[The importance of virtual worlds in **mediating social encounters and
managing**, if not out- right shaping, the political spectrum is
evidenced in]{.mark} the [controversies]{.mark} surrounding Cambridge
Analytica, foreign troll farms, and Russian interference in the 2016
American presidential elec- tion.]{.underline} [These instances, and the
management of the perception of authorities in
dictatorships]{.underline}

[or Communist systems, such as Chinese and North Korean censorship of
internal computer networks**, [emphasize the importance of cyberpunk's
critique]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, Blade Runner 2049
(Villeneuve 2017) evokes nothing so much as the desperation of an
individual who knows their reality is a simulacrum but continues to
function through the cruel optimism it offers, since this is the only
defense against a slide into nihilistic solipsism. Even though K (Ryan
Gosling) knows he is a replicant he fantasizes about being something
more; even though he knows his companion, Joi (Ana de Armas) is a
hologram he believes the positive feedback she offers.3 [The [desperate
need for the **validation of the newsfeed** is dramatized]{.mark} as he
moves through his lonely world in which the hustle and bustle of the
multicultural cityscapes in Blade Runner (Scott 1982) is replaced with a
world in which K is most often pictured alone]{.underline}. Ryan
Gosling's distancing affect portrays K as perhaps most alone when
interacting with others onscreen. [Blade Runner 2049 reflects a world in
which the replacement of life with its simulation---through replicant
identity, which acts as [**an analogy for living through the simulated
identities created through social media**---is complete, and as a result
**a meaningful identity is impossible to inhabit**]{.mark} and K is left
with the distinct sen- sation that his world has been emptied out, with
meaningful action that might change society happening 'out there,' out
of his control.]{.underline}

#### Authentic encounters can only occur through a rejection of the technological society we inhabit

[[The issues of alienation from ontological meaning]{.mark} as a result
of social media simulation [is taken up]{.mark} in many more
contemporary post-cyberpunk texts.]{.underline} For example[, the
anthology series Black Mirror (2011--) repeatedly returns to the
possibilities for ontological meaning [in **a world dominated by the
simulations and simulacra of online identity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
again in ways that act as commentary on contemporary socio-political
realities and possibilities. The episode "Nosedive" (2016) features a
social system that has been compared to China's Social Credit System
which aims to assign each citizen a rating that can be affected by
feedback on one's social activities.4 The episode shows the quick
decline of one woman's social credit as she attempts to attend a
friend's wedding but finds herself embarrassed and socially bankrupt.
The episode concludes with the woman imprisoned, having hit rock bottom.
She begins an exchange with the occupant of the cell next to her own,
and the episode ends with them shouting increasingly creative insults at
each other, culminating in them angrily and gleefully shouting "fuck
you" at one another. Of course, the premise of the episode is not based
on a future social credit system, whether the one under development in
China or any other; rather, [the episode critiques the attention to
appearances that must be paid in order to develop social capital on
social media and suggests **[a freedom that can be found in being ex-
cluded from these systems, in becoming an outcast]{.mark}**. In this
relatively liberatory ending, the show offers some hope for an authentic
encounter with others and with one's own being.]{.underline}

In conclusion[, [technological simulation today has successfully
**mapped 'reality' in its entirety**,]{.mark} from the capabilities of
Google Earth to the tracking of human individuals via their social media
accounts.]{.underline} We have entered, according to Christoph
[Kucklick, a granular society in which the **[digital begins to replace
reality ]{.mark}**]{.underline}[(]{.mark}10). Kucklick understands
granularity as a measure of resolu- tion, the precision of data, because
through digitalization our world is already mapped and the changes now
are in the finesse of the resolution (10). [Such a view reflects
[Baudrillard's diagnosis that we are living in a hyperreal
simulacrum]{.mark} and that the differences that will be made to that
situation are merely those of degree]{.underline}. In the more
optimistic exemplars of post-cyberpunk there are suggestions that
[[the]{.mark} [real is not gone forever and might be accessed, either
through **worker solidarity or through reconnecting with others without
the mediation of social networks**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Hopes
such as these represent a departure from Baudrillard's bleak outlook and
show that [[cyberpunk]{.mark} and, perhaps more effectively,
**post-cyberpunk [continue to engage with the concepts of simula- cra
and simulation but in different ways]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} attempting to
open out new ways forward. As cyber- punk and post-cyberpunk continue to
show, we can refuse to be stranded in **the deserts of the electronic
night.**]{.underline}

Arguably, [the most obvious descendant of Sun Ra is American R&B artist
[Janelle Monáe, whose explicitly Afrofuturist]{.mark}/Afrocyberpunk
[work]{.mark} on The ArchAndroid (2010), The Electric Lady (2013), and
Dirty Computer (2018) [shows a deep awareness of how racial identity
politics blended with sound technology can **impact an ever-quickening
global popular technoculture defined by race**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}
As Christine Capetola writes in her contribution to this collection,
[Mon[áe "creates her own black, queer, and feminist version of cyberpunk
**through**]{.mark} **interfacing [her body and musical
tech]{.mark}nology**" (246) and, in so doing, partakes in an
"Afrocyberpunk project of using (music) technology" to **[free herself

structures]{.underline} (247). Monáe's oeuvre is loosely organized
around the struggles of her android alter ego, Cindi Mayweather, in a
dystopian near future where the freedom to love is circumscribed by the
pow- erful Droid Authority, prompting Mayweather's growth from the
persecuted Other in Metropolis: The Chase Suite (2007) to the
revolutionary icon of an android underground in The ArchAndroid, a time
traveling icon who may have gone missing in Electric Lady but has proven
inspirational to "droids from all across Metropolis \[who\] gather in
nightclubs \[\...\] and barbershops where they revel in the otherness
that separates them from humans" (Pulliam-Moore). "[[The
android]{.mark}," Monáe explains in an interview with Dorian Lynskey,
"**[represents a new form of the Other]{.mark}** \[\...\] And I believe
we're going to be living in a world of androids by 2029. How will we all
get along? Will we treat the android humanely? What type of society will
it be when we're integrated? I've felt like the Other at certain points
in my life. I felt like it was [a **universal language**]{.mark} that we
could all understand."]{.underline} This focus on the 'universal
language of the Other' fuels Monáe's Dirty Computer and its accompanying
film, or what Monáe calls an emotion picture, that depicts an oppressive
future where humans who don't conform to 'proper' codes of behavior are
quarantined by New Dawn agents and forced to undergo a "cleansing," a
euphemism for a techno-chemical lobotomy where rebellious memories are
wiped away and the subject reprogrammed accordingly. Having revealed
that Dirty Computer is definitely part of the larger Cindi Mayweather
narrative universe,6 Monáe's Afrofuturist and Afrocyberpunk promises to
expand her artistic oeuvre in exciting and much-anticipated directions.

[Although space prevents a full analysis of Afrofuturism and
Afrocyberpunk in other media, [it would be remiss not to]{.mark} at
least **[point to the cyberpunk influences in Afrofuturist art and
fashion]{.mark}.** For example, aside from the fact King T'Challa's suit
in Black Panther is a cybernetic enhance- ment, turning him into a
cyberpunk-styled cyborg]{.underline},7 the Afrofuturist fashion that was
lauded when the film was released is a central component of black
cultural identity in the 21st century. As Connie Wang writes, "it's easy
enough to spot: powerful Black men and women dressed in Besotho
blankets, Himba braids, Maasai collars, as well as Egyptian anks and
crowns inspired by Yourban deity Oshun---remixed with superhero
textiles, gravity-defying jewelry, and technicolor hair," some of which
is reminiscent of cyberpunk visual motifs. [Fashion is also a key draw
to the immensely successful Afropunk Festival which, inspired by the
documentary Afro-Punk (Spooner 2003), provides opportunities to showcase
black arts in all forms of cultural expression]{.underline}. Similarly,
the Afrofuturist art show "In Their Own Form" at the Museum of
Contemporary Photography in Chicago (12 April, 2018, to 8 July, 2018)
featured more than a dozen contemporary artists, includ- ing Senegalese
Alun Be whose "Edification" series includes photographs of young black
children wearing virtual reality goggles (Sayej). Or, as Pamela Phatsimo
Sunstrum points out, Kiluanji Kia Henda's photo-based project, Icarus 13
(2006--08), imagines Angolan astrophysicists preparing for the first
expedition to the sun, weaving the Icarus myth and Apollo 13 that
"provides another example of a creative practice that collapses myth
into sf while simultaneously igniting African postcolonial imaginings"
(118). [Even something as mundane as searching for Afrofuturist fashion
on Pinterest reveals cyberpunk influences in the litany of images.
**[Afrocyberpunk remains a viable and ongoing strain in the larger
Afrofuturist field]{.mark},** particularly when it comes to the visual
splen- dor on display in fashion and the visual arts.]{.underline}

In closing, [with its focus on "issues of social justice in a global and
technology-intensive world" (Lavender, Afrofuturism Rising 3),
Afrofuturism has grown more complex since Dery's "Black to the Future"
and has become a useful analytical tool that has, in many ways, evolved
beyond its early roots in cyberpunk, at least conceptually or
theoretically]{.underline}. For example, as Bould demonstrates in his
work on Afrocyberpunk cinema, [[Afrofuturism anticipates "a
transformation]{.mark}" in sf studies, all the [while working against
"**the typical cyberpunk acceptance of capitalism**]{.mark} \[and\]
assimilation of certain currently marginalized peoples into a global
system that might, at best, tolerate some relatively minor (although not
unimportant) reforms]{.underline}" (182) by breaking with the colorblind
future of sf. Sim- ilarly, Afro-British philosopher Kodwo Eshun
discusses how Afrofuturism establishes a "webbed network[," [a]{.mark}n
[historical matrix reflecting black people's "**perpetual fight for
human status**]{.mark}, a yearn- ing for human rights, and a struggle
for inclusion within the human species" which continues beyond chattel
slavery far into the future as it connects black people across
time]{.underline} (More Brilliant 00\[- 006\]). Elsewhere, Eshun
identifies such connections as "countermemories that contest the
colonial archive, thereby situating the collective trauma of slavery as
the founding moment of modernity" ("Further" 288). [[Thus,
**Afrofuturism recuperates a seemingly stolen past**]{.mark} that many
people would like to forget---the scene from Black Panther when Erik
Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) lectures the white museum curator about
stolen African history comes immediately to mind---and creates options
for cultural analysis]{.underline}. Or, as Kilgore notes, "[Afrofuturism
can be seen as less a marker of black authenticity and **more a cultural
force**, an episteme that betokens a shift in our largely uncon- scious
assumptions about what histories matter and how they may serve as a
precondition for any]{.underline}

[future we may imagine"]{.underline} (564). The recovery work suggested
by Eshun and Kilgore, coupled with the transformative anticipations that
Bould highlights, represents Afrocyberpunk moments where readers dive
into this historical archive to retrieve a sense of black humanity
separate from the cy- borg image---i.e., the "coded as natural machines"
that Dery describes---that has been created for black people by
typically white power structures[. In this respect, [Afrofuturism and
Afrocyberpunk enable black people to see themselves in the
technocultural world **as more than the flesh machines they have been
regarded as**]{.mark} for much of history in the New World, and while
the ongoing develop- ment of both Afrofuturism and Afrocyberpunk is
deeper and richer in its scope than anything Dery could have imagined,
"reflecting counter histories, hacking and or appropriating the
influence of network software, database logic, cultural analytics, deep
remixability, neurosciences, enhance- ment and augmentation, gender
fluidity, posthuman possibility, the speculative sphere, with trans-
disciplinary applications" (Anderson and Jones x); [it still reflects a
cyberpunk heritage **as it considers hacking, remixing, augmentation,
and the posthuman as central conceits**]{.mark}, while allowing for
other modes of storytelling in black speculative fictions.]{.underline}

## Indigenous Futurisms

### 1NC

#### Link -- without recognizing the impact of indigenous contributions to imagining futurisms, colonial violence is recreated 

Corinna **Lenhardt 20** is a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at the
University of Münster, Germany, where she also earned her Ph.D. in
American studies in 2018. Her research and teaching interests include
ethnic studies and African American studies, race, gender, and gothic
fiction. She has published articles and chapters on Indigenous fiction,
film, and online activism. ("Indigenous Futurisms," The Routledge
Companion to Cyberpunk Culture, Chapter 41, p344) //le

Since Grace L. Dillon (Anishinaabe) published her watershed anthology of
Indigenous science fiction (sf) writing, Walking the Clouds: An
Anthology of Indigenous Science Fiction (2012), [[Indigenous
futurisms]{.mark}---the plural indicating the vast variety of
culture-specific negotiations and inventions from Indigenous peoples
across the globe1---[**conceptualizes two distinct, yet intimately
related aspects** of Indigenous]{.mark} speculative cultural
[productions]{.mark}.]{.underline} First, creators of "Indigenous
futurisms sometimes intentionally experiment with, sometimes
intentionally dislodge, sometimes merely accompany, but invariably
change the perimeters of sf" (Dillon, Walking 3). [Grappling with
mainstream sf's troubling persistence in settler colonial fantasies2 and
hegemonically configured and reinforced race discourses, [**Indigenous
futurisms provide an alternative to the "steady diet of the feathers and
the fantasy**" fed to non-Indigenous audiences]{.mark} "as what it
supposedly means to be a 'real Indian'"]{.underline} (Adare 1). This by
no means entails only the inclusion of authentic Indigenous characters
as part of futurist texts; rather, "they are generated by and
inspirational for Native peoples" (Medak-Saltzman 143). This latter
aspect already implies the second key aspect prevalent in Indigenous
futurisms; that is, [[the understanding of Indigenous futurisms as
age-old Indigenous cultural practices predating western concepts of sf
easily by thousands of years]{.mark}:]{.underline} As Dillon writes,
["\[m\]any experimental narrative tech- niques that cutting-edge SF
authors congratulate themselves for discovering have actually **been
around for millennia in Indigenous storytelling**"]{.underline} ("The
People" Pos. 116). She goes on to remark that ["\[s\]lipstreams,
alternative realities, multiverses, time traveling---the stock tropes of
mainstream SF are ancient elements of Indigenous ways of
knowing]{.underline}" ("The People" Pos. 116). By working from within
Indigenous spiritual, cultural, and scientific worldviews and
traditions, which entail concepts that have not just been dismissed in
mainstream sf, but in the wake of the western Enlightenment generally,
[[Indigenous futurist texts **position indigeneity at the heart of both
scientific progress and sociocultural futurity**]{.mark}. In sum,
[Indigenous futurisms indigenize mainstream]{.mark} sf [by
**re-envisioning its tropes and motif**]{.mark}**s** from complex,
culture-specific Indigenous perspectives; the historically and still
predominately white genre is mobilized from both within and without to
push Indigenous peoples from the stereotype-ridden margins to the center
of sf and, thus, into futurity.]{.underline}

#### The alt is embracing a survivance mentality -- solves perpetually viewing Indigenous peoples as victims

Corinna **Lenhardt 20** is a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at the
University of Münster, Germany, where she also earned her Ph.D. in
American studies in 2018. Her research and teaching interests include
ethnic studies and African American studies, race, gender, and gothic
fiction. She has published articles and chapters on Indigenous fiction,
film, and online activism. ("Indigenous Futurisms," The Routledge
Companion to Cyberpunk Culture, Chapter 41, p344-345) //le

Dillon's optimism regarding sf's potential to "honor Native traditions,
to dig into history lingering behind myth, and to share with readers the
ramifications of indigenous diasporas in ways that recognize their
accountability" ("Miindiwag" 236) intersects with the work of Gerald
Vizenor (Anishinaabe) and his oft-cited concept of "survivance."
[[Survivance com- bines **Indigenous 'survival' with 'endurance' and
'resistance**.' It implies an "**active repudiation of dominance,
tragedy, and victimry**"]{.underline}]{.mark} (Vizenor, Fugitive 15[),
that is both a rejection of estab- lished images of 'the Indian' and
connected narratives of victimization and an insistence on]{.underline}

[Indigenous continuance and adaptability]{.underline}. [This insistence
neither denies the historical process of colonization nor its
contemporary impact; rather, [**it refuses to see Indigenous peoples
defined by these processes as perpetual victims** without
agency]{.mark}. Translated to the context of sf, **[survivance entails
pride, optimism, and (self-)empowerment]{.mark}** in the face of white
mainstream practices of stereotyping and exclusion---Indigenous peoples
and cultures are alive and kicking, today as well as in fantastic
futures.]{.underline}

### Solvency

#### Indigenous futurism can be a useful tool for analyzing dominant ideologies

Corinna **Lenhardt 20** is a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at the
University of Münster, Germany, where she also earned her Ph.D. in
American studies in 2018. Her research and teaching interests include
ethnic studies and African American studies, race, gender, and gothic
fiction. She has published articles and chapters on Indigenous fiction,
film, and online activism. ("Indigenous Futurisms," The Routledge
Companion to Cyberpunk Culture, Chapter 41, p345) //le

Given her understanding of Indigenous futurisms as intersection of
survivance and sf, as renun- ciation of hegemonic dominance through
continuous and creative practices of cultural identity and resistance,
it is not surprising that Dillon is also the first scholar to hint at
the possibility of cyberpunk narratives by Indigenous artists.
[Arguably, [cyberpunk's punk attitude commits this]{.mark} sf [subgenre
to showing "**how and why dominant ideologies marginalize dispossessed
strata of the population"**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cavallaro 20).
[[Cyberpunk's]{.mark} mostly dystopian, technologically enhanced, urban
[societies]{.mark} in which "globalization and capitalism have led to
the rule of multinational conglomerates, while margin- alized
individuals live in a post-industrial setting defined by cold metal
technology, virtual reality, and crime" (Lavigne 11), len[d themselves
to the Indigenous practices of survivance in the face of
oppression]{.mark} and marginalization while subjected to dystopian
colonial realities.]{.underline} Dillon's anthological inclusion of Red
Spider White Web (1990), an important novel by Misha (Métis) that
"interpenetrates the cyberpunk" with Indigenous tribalism (Dillon,
Walking 185), has triggered a necessary inquiry into the possibilities
and limits of Indigenous cyberpunk cultural practices. In 2018, this
inquiry fueled Brian K. Hudson's (Cherokee) "Indigenous Cyberpunk
Manifesto":

[Gibson constructed the console cowboy, but **[we are the digital
Natives]{.mark}**. We are the original Natives of the web, the
tech-savvy NDNs weaving in and out of discussion threads, **[the
warriors with keyboards who carry sparks into cyberspace]{.mark}**.3 We
are the coders who create sovereign virtual worlds, the digital code
talkers who braid Indigenous tongues into networks of resistance. We've
navigated the webs of branching nodes since time immemorial---before
kubernētēs became cybernetics and before punk was ponk. Our digital
allies boost our signals. **We [are Indigenous
cyberpunks.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

## Empire

### General

#### The historical colonialism underpinning the structure of society shifts to the body under a cybernetic lens

John **Rieder 20** is the author of Colonialism and the Emergence of
Science Fiction (2008) and Science Fiction and the Mass Cultural Genre
System (2017). He received the Science Fiction Research Asso- ciation's
Pioneer Award in 2011, and the Pilgrim Award in 2019. After receiving
his Ph.D. at Yale University in 1980, he taught at the University of
Hawai'i at Mānoa until his retirement in 2018. ("Empire," The Routledge
Companion to Cyberpunk Culture, Chapter 40, p339) //le

[Sterling's summary of body and mind invasion makes clear that
[**cyberpunk's tropes of invasion** are all about the permeability of
boundaries]{.mark} that formerly seemed solid]{.underline}. As Donna J.
Haraway observed in her "A Manifesto for Cyborgs," written in the same
years and in response to the same social upheaval as the fiction of the
cyberpunk coterie, [the boundaries between organism and ma- chine, human
and animal, and the physical and non-physical turn out to be porous and
unreliable in the society taking shape around cybernetic command and
control.]{.underline} [[**The invasion of the body** by prosthetics
and]{.mark} of the mind by [digital data]{.mark} and software
[highlights not only the contingency of individual identity but]{.mark}
perhaps even more [the vulnerability]{.mark} of the employee or citizen
to forces of control that are mediated by technology but **[structured
by several centuries of symbiosis between capitalism and
colonialism]{.mark}.**]{.underline} As the regime of flexible
accumulation takes hold in the 1970s and 1980s, [stripping U.S. labor of
industrial and manufacturing jobs and cheapening production by
exploiting formerly colonized labor markets, domestic labor and
citizenship are systematically devalued]{.underline} by neoliberal
attacks on the power of labor unions and the entitlements of citizens.
If Moylan is right about the importance of the re-structuring of labor
to cyberpunk's construction of characters, [the boundaries being
violated in the fictions respond to [this **systematic invasion of
boundaries**]{.mark} [formerly relied upon to protect the livelihood of
first world workers]{.mark}]{.underline}. Cyberpunk's array of hackers
and meat puppets hyperbolizes the insecurity of the Rust-Belt-era labor
market and the immense asymmetry of power that leaves workers
increasingly at the mercy of multinational corporate strategies.

The thematic centrality of figures of invasion in early cyberpunk is
rivaled by its attempts to imagine totality, or as Sterling puts it in
the Mirrorshades manifesto: "the tools of global integration---the
satellite media net, the multinational corporation---fascinate the
cyberpunks and figure constantly in their work" (xiv). [[The plot of
invasion itself is often driven by]{.mark} an un- derlying
[transformation]{.mark} of the concept [of totality]{.mark} from some
kind of spatiotemporal aggregation [into]{.mark} **[disembodied
information]{.mark}.** In the re-structuring of the global economy this
means that the tactical importance of occupying territory gives way to
monopolizing access to employment, rights, resources, and
information]{.underline}. The Sprawl trilogy responds with a plot built
entirely on breaking into corporate data banks and breaking down the
barriers that separate and fragment the totality of information in them.
But at the same time as cyberpunk often fantasizes niches of resistance
or escape (e.g. in Mirrorshades: "Freezone" \[1985\], Lewis Shiner's
"Till Human Voices Wake Us" \[1984\], Sterling and Gibson's "Red Star,
Winter Orbit" \[1983\]), it seldom imagines the possibility of a
structural transformation in economic or political terms. Instead, the
transfor- mation in Gibson takes place at the level of informational
totality with the merging of the two Tessier-Ashpool AIs, while for the
workers and citizens of the Sprawl, nothing changes: "Things are
things," as the transformed Wintermute puts it at the end of Neuromancer
(270). What has often been said but bears repeating is that neocolonial
capitalism has here turned into 'things' as such. [All too often in
cyberpunk, [**capitalism tends to operate as if it were nature
itself**,]{.mark} and the premise of capitalist growth as the underlying
engine of history may be precisely the reason the Sprawl trilogy reverts
to expansionist space travel at its conclusion.]{.underline}

#### The new frontier of cyberspace results in expansionist elements surviving through cyberpunk 

John **Rieder 20** is the author of Colonialism and the Emergence of
Science Fiction (2008) and Science Fiction and the Mass Cultural Genre
System (2017). He received the Science Fiction Research Asso- ciation's
Pioneer Award in 2011, and the Pilgrim Award in 2019. After receiving
his Ph.D. at Yale University in 1980, he taught at the University of
Hawai'i at Mānoa until his retirement in 2018. ("Empire," The Routledge
Companion to Cyberpunk Culture, Chapter 40, p339) //le

[[**What happens when the land of discovery is cyberspace?**]{.mark} In
an essay on Gibson and cyberpunk, Istvan Csicsery-Ronay distinguishes
between the expansionist fantasies of early sf, based on co- lonialism
and Social Darwinism, and the postmodern and cyberpunk counter-movement
he calls implosion, where the rationality of instrumental reason is
ground into fragments. [In]{.mark} Gibson's [cyberspace]{.mark},
however, **[a lot of expansionist elements
survive]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The hackers in "Burning Chrome" (1982)
and Neuromancer (1984) use invasive software developed by the military,
signaling a world where technological development continues to be driven
by military competition, with infor- mation rather than land now the
stakes of battle. [Gibson's **hacker protagonists are 'cowboys**,'
invoking the expansionist mythology of the American
Western.]{.underline} At the end of the entire Sprawl series, in the
concluding moments of Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988), an AI, an uploaded
cowboy, and a software construct board a virtual vehicle bound for
another solar system. Many of the critics less enamored with cyberpunk
have complained about the way such plot elements blunt the critical edge
of Gibson's depiction of a dystopian near future. Csicsery-Ronay, for
instance, says that the [[cyberpunks "write as if they are both the
victims of a life-negating system and the heroic adventurers of
thrill]{.underline}]{.mark}" (192). One might well argue, then, that in
Gibson's [cyberspace it is not so much that the tired and wrongheaded
ideologies of [American self-congratulatory fantasy are]{.mark}
abandoned or overcome as that **they are [restylized and
recirculated]{.mark}**---combined, first of all, with the cyni- cism
that recognizes the 'life-negating' environmental and social
consequences of contemporary [capitalism]{.mark} at the same time as
**[it continues to exploit its expansionist ethos for thrill and
adventure]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Thus, arguably, Gibson's Sprawl
fictions do not demystify the discoverer's fantasy but rather recast it
with cyberspace as the new frontier. We know very well, the reformulated
fantasy would then go, that this space is an artifice constructed by the
collective efforts of the corporate economy and supported by the
material infrastructure of the entire computing technology of
contemporary society, [[but we act as **if were an autonomous
realm**]{.mark} that sustains itself as an independent reality and is
available to appropriation and inhabitation by those able to adapt
themselves to its environment.]{.underline} And so the Tessier-Ashpool
AIs, the software construct of Julius Deane, and the uploaded minds of
Bobby, the cowboy, and Angie, his girl, become in the end the natives,
or rather the indige- nized settlers, of a newly opened interstellar
frontier.

## Critical Race Theory

### General -- Afrocyberpunk 

#### Afrocyberpunk offers an explanatory power from which we can examine complicate question

Isiah **Lavender III 20** is the Sterling-Goodman Professor of English
at the University of Georgia, where he researches and teaches courses in
African American literature and science fiction. His books include
Afrofuturism Rising: The Literary Prehistory of a Movement (2019) and
Race in American Science Fiction (2011), as well as the edited
collections Dis-Orienting Planets: Racial Representations of Asia in
Science Fiction (2017) and Black and Brown Planets: The Politics of Race
in Science Fiction (2014). He is a co-editor of the oldest science
fiction journal Extrapolation. ("Critical Race Theory," The Routledge
Companion to Cyberpunk Culture, Chapter 37, p312-313) //le

[Led by Delany's example, established [black writers]{.mark} like
Barnes, Octavia Butler, Nalo Hopkinson, and Nnedi Okorafor have
[responded strongly to white cyberpunk by **challenging racial
hierarchies**.]{.mark} **[Afrocyberpunk clarifies significant moments in
American history]{.mark} and enables us to begin thinking** through
complicated questions of racial inequality, citizenship and rights,
freedom, and justice]{.underline}. Counter-stories abound in
Afrocyberpunk neutralizing the various racial stereotypes projected
across a white cyberpunk while its cyberspace networks, hackers, and cy-
borgs look entirely different from mainstream cyberpunk and its racial
shortcomings. That's the

beauty of Afrocyberpunk[: **[It does not at all have to look like
cyberpunk]{.mark},** all the while deploying familiar motifs common in
cyberpunk.]{.underline} As a result, black writers create entire black
planets with which to explore alternative life experiences.

#### Afrocyberpunk can challenge the whiteness of cyberpunk

Isiah **Lavender III 20** is the Sterling-Goodman Professor of English
at the University of Georgia, where he researches and teaches courses in

fiction journal Extrapolation. ("Critical Race Theory," The Routledge
Companion to Cyberpunk Culture, Chapter 37, p314-315) //le

In closing, [[Afrocyberpunk]{.mark} is very much like Afrofuturism, a
distinct African American mode of futurism,7 in that **it [represents
another way to describe black speculative cultural practices]{.mark},**
only with particular attention to cyberspace, simulations, and/or
virtual realities (technical or bi- ological) as sites of revolution and
social reform informed by critical race theory.]{.underline}
Afrocyberpunk stories by Delany, Butler, Barnes, Hopkinson, and Okorafor
register on our collective senses, vibe

with our hearts, minds, and spirits. [Call it an embodiment **of a soul
feedback loop**. Undeniably, acknowledgement of Afrocyberpunk amplifies
and expands the bandwidth of race studies in sf. **[Afrocyberpunk
divests whiteness]{.mark}** as the norm of our technological imaginings
without elimi- nating white people. Indeed, these black writers [offer
us **consciously racialized settings**]{.mark} in their imaginings,
**[resolutely challenging the whiteness of
cyberpunk.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### Alt -- Discussion

#### Words can deconstruct the master narrative of the digital divide

Isiah **Lavender III 20** is the Sterling-Goodman Professor of English

African American literature and science fiction. His books include
Afrofuturism Rising: The Literary Prehistory of a Movement (2019) and

Companion to Cyberpunk Culture, Chapter 37, p308-309) //le

[The notion of [the digital divide]{.mark} at the turn of the 21st
century [has become a master narrative]{.mark} of race in our time that
is [in **desperate need of ongoing confrontation**]{.mark}. The digital
divide con- cerns disparities in access to computers and the internet
between whites and blacks]{.underline}, a point Alicia H. Hines et al.
reflect on in Technicolor: Race, Technology, and Everyday Life,
remarking how "[the digital divide [has become a **self-fulfilling
prophecy**, confirming that people of color can't keep pace in a
high-tech world]{.mark} that threatens to outstrip them]{.underline}"
(1--2). In his novel Blood Brothers (1996), Barnes anticipates the
digital divide but dismantles it with his black hacker/ game designer
Derek Waites who goes by the alias Captain Africa. Simply put, [Barnes
demon- strates how **[words can deconstruct this master
narrative]{.mark}** by organizing the novel around a black man with
exceptional computer skills, a black hacker as skilled as mainstream
cyberpunk's oft- white hacker elites.]{.underline} Barnes purposely
disrupts this image of the digital divide, one founded on the racist
assumption that "in image after published image, the face of that
\[digital divide\] is black" (Kevorkian 39), via his counter-story which
affords his readers a subaltern view of race in cyberspace.

### Anti-Blackness Link

#### They link -- cyberpunk reifies whiteness through rendering racial identities obsolescent

Isiah **Lavender III 20** is the Sterling-Goodman Professor of English

fiction journal Extrapolation. ("Critical Race Theory," The Routledge
Companion to Cyberpunk Culture, Chapter 37, p310) //le

Just as they do in the physical world, [[colorblindness]{.mark} and the
digital divide **[reinforce race and racism in the technocultures of
cyberpunk]{.mark},** where cyberspace, criminality, computers, com-
panies, and corporeality rule]{.underline}.2 That is why, as Alondra
Nelson writes, "[the racialized digital divide narrative that circulates
in the public sphere and [the bodiless]{.mark}, color-blind mythoto-
pias of [cybertheory]{.mark} and commercial advertising [have **become
the unacknowledged frames of reference for understanding race in the
digital age**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (6). [Cyberpunk's claim to a
post-racial future where human bodies are simply "meat" prisons and
human minds can escape to "the bodiless exultation of
cyberspace]{.underline}" (Gibson 6), [all the while socializing with
other post-human technicities,3 is misguided at best. Unhinged from the
race and racism of the past, the cy- berpunk future champions high tech
low life [that **renders racial identities obsolescent**]{.mark}, as if
cyberspace is not a racially coded environment. Instead,
[cyberspace]{.mark}, imagined as an "eighth continent" where anything
goes, **[reproduces and reifies whiteness]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
virtual reality's fictional- ized landscape (Chude-Sokei 6).

### Afrocyberpunk -- Perm

#### Critical race theory can be applied to cyberpunk to generate new models of thought 

Isiah **Lavender III 20** is the Sterling-Goodman Professor of English

Cyberpunk explores the near future; loosely articulated, it wrestles
with computing questions such as networking, hacking, virtual reality,
and artificial intelligence (AI), as well as cyborgs that represent the
human/machine continuum and the emergence of the posthuman. These high-
tech notions represent the cyber half of the definition. [The punk half
often signifies street life, dealers and addicts, the contract workers
and precariat, the poor and have-nots with no material benefits,
sometimes quite literally homeless people living in the streets,
relegated far down the socioeconomic scale on the other side of the
digital divide and hustling to survive.]{.underline} Although one might
think of black folks here because of the disproportionate number of
blacks in America op- pressed by poverty and living on the downward
slope of the socioeconomic scale, the cyberpunk movement largely ignores
this reality. Instead, the punks scholars may think of are the Panther
Moderns from William Gibson's monumental novel Neuromancer (1984), the
white hacker street gang prowling through the urban sprawl adorned with
micro soft buds implanted behind their ears and face-changing skin
grafts.

[[What has **often gone overlooked is black writers' contribution to
cyberpunk**]{.mark}, even if that contribution is overshadowed by
mainstream cyberpunk]{.underline}. For example[, consider Aubry Knight,
the black protagonist of Steven Barnes's Streetlethal (1983) who, as a
former mafia enforcer and present Nullboxer (a zero gravity variation of
the sport), is inhumanly strong and has a penchant for wearing dark
(mirror)shades]{.underline}. Published a year before Neuromancer, this
oft-overlooked novel trades in many of cyberpunk's hallmarks: Barnes
perfectly balances cyberpunk's posthuman street 'cool' with the glitz
and grime of a near-future dystopian Los Angeles, and Aubry would be at
home in any mainstream cyberpunk setting, whether Gibson's Night City
(Neuromancer) or the crowded Los Angeles streets of Ridley Scott's Blade
Runner (1982). [Unfortunately, Streetlethal is very rarely ascribed to
the cyberpunk movement (or any of its various 'punk' siblings, such as
ste- ampunk, splatterpunk, or biopunk), instead foreshadowing
Afrocyberpunk or cyberfunk, recent divergences made by black writers
from cyberpunk's norms]{.underline}. [[These]{.mark} more [recent
variations on cyberpunk distort this mode as a deliberate means of
expressing **black discontent with the world**, global capitalism, and
the information age, acutely demonstrating that **cyberpunk is not for
whites only**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Blacks, too, have been, and want to
continue, experimenting in their writing as a way of protesting social
conditions as a countercultural critique.

Aside from telling wonderful stories[, [African American science
fiction]{.underline}]{.mark} [(sf) [writers create their own realities
to **consciously explore racism, recognizing how oppression
fluctuates**]{.mark} be- tween groups, **structurally determined** by
advantages and benefits that the dominant race takes for granted or
feels is their entitlement]{.underline} (i.e., white privilege). Samuel
Delany, Steven Barnes,

Octavia E. Butler, and a host of others use their writings to address
the empathic fallacies many other writers rely on, and shift the
conversations to address the occlusion of race and outright racism
within cyberpunk. [The subsequent emergence of
[Afrocyberpunk]{.mark}---i.e., **[applying critical race theory to the
cyberpunk mindset]{.mark}**, or what Mark Bould has called
"representations of Africa/ Africans/Afrodiaspora in cyberpunk, and
cyberpunk by African and Afrodiasporic writers"--- [with its focus on
high tech low life]{.mark}1 [brings together sf's worldbuilding and
critical race theory's challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline} Critical race
theory explores racial hierarchies and intentional discrimination at the
crossroads of race, law, and power applied to American culture writ
large.

#### Afrocyberpunk provides answers to increasingly pressing questions

Isiah **Lavender III 20** is the Sterling-Goodman Professor of English
at the University of Georgia, where he researches and teaches courses in
African American literature and science fiction. His books include
Afrofuturism Rising: The Literary Prehistory of a Movement (2019) and

in Science Fiction (2014). He is a co-editor of the oldest science
fiction journal Extrapolation. ("Critical Race Theory," The Routledge
Companion to Cyberpunk Culture, Chapter 37, p311) //le

Despite cyberpunk's evolution from its earliest forms in the 1980s,
however, [the apparent permanence of racism prevails in the 21st-century
cyberpunk as well. **[Technology sublimates race]{.mark},** and [this
misdirection becomes relevant in equating posthuman futures with
white-only spaces]{.mark}]{.underline}. From a critical race theory
viewpoint, "preconceptions and myths, for example about black
criminality, shape mindset" (Delgado and Stefancic 42). American readers
have unthinkingly consumed such images for years, and [it becomes
exceedingly difficult to talk back to culturally embedded stereotypes
seen not only in America but all across the world. Instead, [**white
culture reinforces itself** with familiar patterns of
'black=bad']{.mark}; therefore, that which is different or danger- ous
must be quarantined, if not eliminated outright]{.underline}. Efforts to
break resistance to white-authored stories deemed as truth and to effect
change in sf and fantasy must continually come from fans, scholars, and
authors alike. In other words[, while [cyberpunk]{.mark}
[s]{.mark}ignals social media's runaway de- velopment, the digital
revolution, and the increasing importance of technoculture, **its
[portrayal of race remains frozen]{.mark}** in most]{.underline}, if not
all, of its powerful future projections. [From this perspective,
[c]{.mark}ritical [r]{.mark}ace [t]{.mark}heory [applied to
cyberpun]{.mark}k---i.e., Afrocyberpunk---[**provides today's answers to
new questions** being asked about the social construction of racialized
identities]{.mark} imagined by the likes of Gibson, his contemporaries,
and their inspired offspring.]{.underline}

## Cyborg Fem

### General

#### Cyberfeminism utilizes technology as an extension of the human for the means of communication and connection with others 

Patricia **Melzer 20** is an associate professor of German and Gender,
Sexuality and Women's Studies at Temple University. She is the author of
Science Fiction and Feminist Thought (2006) and Death in the Shape of a
Young Girl: Women's Political Violence in the Red Army Faction (2015).
Her research interests are in gender and technology in popular culture,
feminist and queer theory, and women in radical social movements.
("Cyborg Feminism," The Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture,
Chapter 35, p295) //le

[The refusal of the body (i.e., the material more broadly, including
animals, nature, etc.) to disappear in humans' relationship to
technology is central to feminist cyberfiction]{.underline}, and these
narratives are contemporaneous with cultural theories influenced by
cyborg feminism4 that place resistance at the conflicting and imploding
intersections of the cultural and the natural in techno- science. Among
other things[, these theories place [feminist cyberfiction]{.mark} in
the broader context of what Anne Balsamo refers to [as "**technologies
of the gendered body**]{.mark}" and treat it as a space where the
relationship of body and technology is explored in ways that "[offer a
vision of post-human existence where **'technology' and the 'human' are
understood in contiguous**]{.mark} rather than opposi- tional
terms"]{.underline} ("Feminism" 684). Instead of conceptualizing
technology as a medium to erase or overwrite the body, Balsamo argues[,
innovative feminist texts, such as Pat Cadigan's oeuvre,5 offer
"alternative [vision\[s\] of technological embodiment]{.mark} that
\[[are\] consistent with a gendered history of technology]{.mark}: where
technology isn't the means of escape from or transcendence of the body,
**[but rather the means of communication and connection with other
bodies]{.mark}**]{.underline}" ("Feminism" 703). Here it is not the
riddance of the 'meat' that forms the underlying, self-denying,
ultimately unfulfilled desire of the narrative. Instead, [the goal
becomes a mediation of embodiment and technology that refuses to treat
technology based interactions as abstractions.]{.underline}

#### Our subjectivities are constantly shifting and changing -- technology can be used as a metaphor to understand the loose coalescence of the self

Patricia **Melzer 20** is an associate professor of German and Gender,

Science Fiction and Feminist Thought (2006) and Death in the Shape of a
Young Girl: Women's Political Violence in the Red Army Faction (2015).

("Cyborg Feminism," The Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture,
Chapter 35, p296) //le

[[Feminist cyberpunk]{.mark} criticism reco[gnizes the potential of
cyberpunk to **expand the concept of the feminist subject** to include
intersectional identitie]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}. In other words,
feminist cyberfiction departs from the oppositional figuration of the
material and virtual that dominates traditional cyberpunk, a framework
that inherently privileges patriarchal definitions of technoscience.
Instead, [we see socially responsible hacking, individuals in intimate
relationships with trusted partners, and a central focus on the
importance of communal social relationships. [Technology is depicted as
linking the physical body to virtual/digital spaces that **form new
realms of experiences**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Impor- tantly, as Foster
argues, the "telepresence" (130) within feminist cyberfiction locates
the body as a point of reference for any presence in cyberspace; [[the
goal is very rarely, if at all, to escape the body
completely]{.mark}.]{.underline} Cyborg bodies and the presence of AIs
(often embodied by the cyborg/android) display complex and shifting
racialized, gendered, and classed identities while [[transgender char-
acters, paired with cybernetic body modifications, create metaphors for
gender queerness]{.mark}, as do gender non-binary-coded AIs.
[Embodiment]{.mark}, in particular the female body, [is thereby
**central to the narratives**]{.mark}]{.underline}; however, even in
virtual reality where the person's digital avatar relies on some form of
visual representation of the self, these characters represent partial
subjects that inhabit a technological space, a fragmentation of the self
that allows an engagement with the assemblages that make up our
relationship to technology: "[This [\[erosion of boundaries\] signifies
a **complete deconstruction of the body**]{.mark}. People are made of
bits and pieces---human, animal, mechanical, and mystical pieces that
**loosely coalesce into a self**]{.underline}" (Cadora 368).
**[[Subjectivity is therefore envisioned as unstable and constantly
shifting]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as developing from a symbiotic
relationship between technol- ogy and the material body---a relationship
that offers new, posthuman assemblages of becoming.

#### Cyberfeminism serves to destabilize naturalized, essential gender categories -- ruptures traditional thought

Patricia **Melzer 20** is an associate professor of German and Gender,
Sexuality and Women's Studies at Temple University. She is the author of
Science Fiction and Feminist Thought (2006) and Death in the Shape of a
Young Girl: Women's Political Violence in the Red Army Faction (2015).
Her research interests are in gender and technology in popular culture,
feminist and queer theory, and women in radical social movements.
("Cyborg Feminism," The Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture,
Chapter 35, p296-297) //le

[In addition to emphasizing the importance of community and personal
intimacies in the char- acters' navigations of a global capitalism,
[feminist cyberfiction]{.mark} also [reworks]{.mark} the central theme
of [reproduction by **crossing boundaries of virtuality and
embodiment**]{.mark} [while maintaining a classic feminist
concern]{.mark} with women's bodies' relationship to **the politics and
economics of reproduction**.]{.underline} Technology enables cloned
children of lesbian characters, cyborg children, and reproductive tech-
nologies that replace narratives of heteronormative families. In He, She
and It, for example, [Piercy explores various manifestations of maternal
roles that thematize the familiar conflict of family and career (e.g.,
single motherhood) and---specific to technoscience---[**capitalist
exploitations of new reproductive technologies** and mothering
artificial children]{.mark}]{.underline}, in this case a male cyborg. It
is often in the context of reproduction that non-normative sexualities
and queer identities are fore- grounded and conventional boundaries
between self and other are undermined, such as with the mutant
chemical-vat dwellers, Lilim, and their daughters in Harris's Accidental
Creatures, and repli- cation (not reproduction) in Rosenblum's Chimera,
where a clone daughter defines her relationship to her (lesbian) mother
as "Mother. Sister. Self" (307). [At the same time, these narratives
[don't lose sight of **the familiar specter of patriarchal, capitalist
technoscience**]{.mark} in prostitution and surrogate motherhood as
women's options to escape or at least manage poverty]{.underline}
(Cadora 364).

Unlike the binary of feminine technology and masculine hacker that
masculinist cyberpunk establishes and that shores up a heteronormative
narrative framework, [[in feminist **cyberfiction experiences are
depicted to destabilize heterosexual relations**]{.mark} and offer queer
sexualities and non- binary gender constructions]{.underline} (Foster
123--26[). Technology does not simply enable a gender-reversal by
bestowing masculine tendencies onto female bodies]{.underline} (such as
in Molly Millions' or Sarah's respective assassin cyborg bodies) [but
[new identifications]{.mark} that go beyond a humanist gender ideol-
ogy.]{.underline} For example, in Mixon's Glass Houses, Ruby's waldos
are gendered and she assumes the gender of whichever machine she
remote-enters, [[mak]{.mark}ing [a "rethinking of cyborg gender"
possible]{.mark} by ne- gotiating not between the gender binary of male
and female, "but between human and machine"]{.underline} (Leblanc 75);
similarly, the cyborg/clone protagonist Sparrow in Bull's Bone Dance is
gender fluid. [[**The destabilizing effects of cybertechnology on
naturalized, essential binary gender categories** are complemented
by]{.mark} the almost routine presence of [queer]{.mark}/lesbian
[characters in feminist cyberfiction,]{.mark}]{.underline}

such as Glass Houses' Ruby and her girlfriend, Slow River's Lore and
Spanner, Trouble and Her Friends' Trouble and Cerise, and Exit to
Reality's Lydian and Merle, where the female protagonists' queer
sexualities form the center of the story and are instrumental to plot
resolution.

#### Cyberfeminism analyzes technology's role in environmental destruction -- to help or to harm

Patricia **Melzer 20** is an associate professor of German and Gender,
Sexuality and Women's Studies at Temple University. She is the author of
Science Fiction and Feminist Thought (2006) and Death in the Shape of a
Young Girl: Women's Political Violence in the Red Army Faction (2015).
Her research interests are in gender and technology in popular culture,
feminist and queer theory, and women in radical social movements.
("Cyborg Feminism," The Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture,
Chapter 35, p297) //le

Finally, [the late capitalist worlds that form the default setting in
cyberpunk consist of environ- mental destruction and depletion of
natural resources]{.underline}.6 [**[Masculinist cyberpunk displays a
general indifference toward that destruction]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
apparently reveling in the pollution of urban sprawls or fancifully
suggesting, as Gerry Canavan argues, that "\[i\]n virtual space, with no
resource con- sumption or excess pollution to worry about, we can all be
as rich as we want for as long as we want (or so the fantasy goes)" (9).
On the other hand, [[much of feminist cyberfiction thematizes
technology's role in]{.mark} both driving and **preventing
[environmental destruction]{.mark}**,]{.underline} such as in Griffith's
Slow River in which bio-ecotechnology has become a major capitalist
market. [[**Ecological preser- vation becomes a utopian
element**]{.mark} in these narratives that is worth pursuing and/or
mourning, echoing the long tradition of women's activism around
environmentalism.]{.underline} At the same time[, [these narratives
present technological interactions]{.mark} with what has been
constructed as 'the natural' as potentially offering alternative,
posthuman ways of existing, [ultimately **de-stabilizing the binary of
'natural' and 'human**]{.mark},]{.underline}' such as in Harris's
Accidental Creatures, where toxic waste becomes the habitat of a new
mutant posthuman species.

#### Feminist cyberpunk can grapple with how digital culture and biotechnology make the world fluid and unstable -- litany of examples

Patricia **Melzer 20** is an associate professor of German and Gender,
Sexuality and Women's Studies at Temple University. She is the author of
Science Fiction and Feminist Thought (2006) and Death in the Shape of a
Young Girl: Women's Political Violence in the Red Army Faction (2015).
Her research interests are in gender and technology in popular culture,
feminist and queer theory, and women in radical social movements.
("Cyborg Feminism," The Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture,
Chapter 35, p297) //le

[Feminist cyberfiction explores how [cyberculture]{.mark} and its
multiple cyber-realms **[highlight the fluid, unstable
elements]{.mark}** that make up people's lives]{.underline}. Today, [the
connections, networks, and temporal instabilities of digital culture and
biotechnology reflect the constantly changing environmental assemblages
of identities in the material world and both the adverse and beneficiary
effects they have]{.underline}. The various ways in which technology
facilitates posthuman interactions creates a familiar pattern of the
diverse and contradictory ways in which feminism has manifested before
cybercul- ture's digital communications: [[Women hackers]{.mark} who use
coding skills in their **social justice activ- ism** or to write gender
non-binary and/or anti-racist games [exist next to **the sexist flaming
wars**]{.mark} that break out against women's presence within that
hacker culture; [**queer, feminist-identified, and women-centered sex
sites** exist within an Internet that drives a major mainstream,
**hetero- sexist misogynist porn culture**]{.mark}; social media hosts
**radical queer anti-capitalist feminist activists next to
white-centered, liberal faux feminism** that is not actively
feminist]{.underline} (colloquially known as 'Tumblr-feminism'), [or
**black women organizers** in the Black Lives Matter movement and
immigration-rights activists are maintained by the same servers that
enable **white supremacist women** to disseminate their political
views]{.underline}. [[**Profit-driven technoscience** has heterosexual
couples from the global North travel to the South where they can afford
a **surrogate**]{.mark} to carry their child conceived via donor-sperm,
[while queer and/or transgender couples in western nations use repro-
ductive technologies to form **non-normative
families**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Technoscience demands a framework that
confronts gender exploitation and oppression in ways that account for
these complex and changing formations. In this vein, [[feminist
cyberfiction integrates elements that have been erased in defi- nitions
of feminist subjects:]{.mark} the various **pleasures** of the
human/machine interface, [the **unpredict- ability** of how technology
gets applied,]{.mark} and the coupling of matter(s) of various
origin(s).]{.underline} Instead of locating a stable identity of the
feminist posthuman subject on a 'grid' of system intersections, [the
most innovative and radical feminist cyberfiction incorporates that
which lies outside the 'grid' into our feminist engagement with
cyberpunk culture---"the forces that make subject formation tenuous, if
not impossible or even undesirable]{.underline}" (Puar 49).

#### Hacking points to the malleable nature of technology

Patricia **Melzer 20** is an associate professor of German and Gender,

("Cyborg Feminism," The Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture,
Chapter 35, p297-298) //le

[[Feminist cyberfiction's emphasis on an unstable]{.mark}, constantly
changing human/[technology]{.mark} in- terface [is echoed in the term
'hacking']{.mark} as one of the most important developments in western
cyberculture for feminist theories today. '[Hacking' here indicates the
**mastery of a specialized**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[**technology that extends beyond** computer coding]{.mark} or digital
technologies, such as the Queer, Trans\* and Feminist Village at the
2015 international Chaos Communication Congress in Germany or in an
issue of .dpi Feminist Journal of Art and Digital Culture on feminist
hacktivism.7]{.underline} In this sense, [hacking links cyberculture's
digital and bio-tech focus to other technologies that can be used to
shape daily lives]{.underline}, such as metal works, weather prediction,
and food processing and growing. [The concept of hacking as using
technology for something creative and innovative undermines the
privileging of digital technology as the exceptional technology that
dominates posthuman discourse. [It also **links the 'natural' with the
'technological'** i]{.mark}n the green-focused tech-
nologies]{.underline} of alternative energy, food growing practices, and
nutrition that are of concern in much of goddess-related,
anti-technology feminist activism. Above all, [it points to [the
**malleable nature of technology**, to the ways in which it can be
learned]{.mark}, appropriated, and changed [to adjust to the
continuously new encounters, connections, and networks that assemble
(post)human experiences]{.mark} and that foreground the instability of
bodies and the identities they host]{.underline}. The gender-binary and
its default constellation of women versus men has structured much of
western feminist thought, and to an extent this gender-binary still
underlies an intersectional analysis (which uses multiple but still
distinct categories, including transgender) and is challenged in our
increasingly cyborgian environment of transgressed boundaries and
partiality.

#### Technology can dissolve identity formations

Patricia **Melzer 20** is an associate professor of German and Gender,

("Cyborg Feminism," The Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture,
Chapter 35, p298) //le

In closing, Haraway's cyborg and the promiscuous alliances generated by
its problematic becoming-through-technology seem more relevant to
feminist theories than ever. [[The cyborg allows for a view of
technology as **a tool for dissolving identity formations** based in
binary ideol- ogies]{.mark} (man/woman, human/animal,
organic/non-organic, etc.), both in conceptual and material
forms]{.underline}. While [the [cyborg questions liberal notions of
individual agency]{.mark} [and]{.mark} autonomy, cyberpunk
culture---like any culture---[can produce **figures of competence and
resilience** that allow the **envi- sioning of effective political
resistance**]{.mark}, such as the female and/or queer
hacker]{.underline}. It is their partiality, that is, their asset, the
non-stable assemblages that shift the ground upon which the world works.
[The [cyborg's power as political myth fails **if we do not recognize
that certain bodies experience the world very much in categories of
control**]{.mark} enforced by Foucauldian institutions of discipline and
punish, and for whom references to their identities---despite their
instability---[remain a **key tool of resistance**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[The particular manifestations of technologized existences that our
cybercultures produce call for a complex understanding of **[how our
bodies are produced, how our intersectional identities are in fact
assembled, and how they find representation]{.mark}** in the figures
stepping off the pages of feminist cyberfiction.]{.underline}

### Queer Specifc

#### Cyberpunk not only is queer, but queers whatever it touches

Wendy Gay **Pearson 20** is an associate professor and chair of the
Department of Women's Studies and Feminist Research at the University of
Western Ontario. She teaches sexuality studies, queer theory, queer and
Indigenous cinema, and science fiction. She is the co-editor of Reverse

co-editor of Queer Universes: Sexualities in Science Fiction (2008).
("Queer Theory," The Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture, Chapter
36, p306) //le

In conclusion, [more recent [cyberpunk]{.mark} and cyberpunk-related
works---i.e., what Andrew M. Butler has called "cyberpunk-flavored"
(57)---[are not only **displacing the masculinist heterosex- uality**
that has defined cyberpunk but are also **moving beyond** the assumption
of an overt identi- fication]{.mark} as lesbian that one finds in such
feminist-queer cyberpunk]{.underline} as Trouble and Her Friends and
Solitaire. At the same time, contemporary works are increasingly
avoiding the obsession with 'stray penetration' and the paranoia about a
continually destabilized, but deeply invested, gender iden- tity that is
so much to the fore in Neuromancer or the Mayor's version of virtual
reality in Trouble and Her Friends. Instead, [a diverse range of works
that help define [cyberpunk as a mode can **extend queer inquiry into
human interactions** in and with cyberspace]{.mark} in ways that take up
and complicate the idea of cyberspace and its technologies as mutually
penetrating/penetrative. **[What queer(ing) cyberpunk readily makes
clear is that cyberspace not only is queer, but queers whatever it
touches.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### Links to Fem

#### Cyberpunk is haunted by notions of the body and how different classes of body are represented in cyberpunk thought 

Patricia **Melzer 20** is an associate professor of German and Gender,
Sexuality and Women's Studies at Temple University. She is the author of
Science Fiction and Feminist Thought (2006) and Death in the Shape of a
Young Girl: Women's Political Violence in the Red Army Faction (2015).
Her research interests are in gender and technology in popular culture,
feminist and queer theory, and women in radical social movements.
("Cyborg Feminism," The Routledge Companion to Cyberpunk Culture,
Chapter 35, p293-294) //le

Feminist theorists insist on the presence of the body as both an
epistemological and ontological basis for any theories of (post)human
existence in which "embodiment replaces a body seen as \[merely\] a
support system for the mind" (Hayles 288); consequently, [[feminist
theories point to the **gendered, racialized, and classed constructions
of the body**]{.mark} throughout history which cyberpunk narratives of
the posthuman subject are unable to escape, despite their best
attempts]{.underline}. In other words, [the at-times fetishized role of
technology in determining human existence---including its desires and
pains---that dominates cyberpunk is continuously disrupted, troubled,
and un- dermined by the refusal of the material to
disappear]{.underline}. Heather Hicks contextualizes cyberpunk's
romanticizing of the mind/body split as complicit with a larger
historical and philosophical west- ern tradition. In other words,
[**[the]{.mark} [body haunts the narratives of cyberpunk]{.mark}** [and
forms a necessary contrast to masculinist fantasies of digital
disembodiment]{.mark},]{.underline} much as gendered and racialized
bodies have formed the necessary contrast within the mind/body split
dominating western philosophy.

The denial of corporeality in early cyberpunk narratives takes place in
conjunction with an in- herent investment in liberal individualism that
contradicts cyberpunk's gesture toward posthuman existence. [Cultural
anxieties induced by the postmodern fragmenting of the self underlie
these narratives in their attempt to negotiate Man's interface with
technology]{.underline}. These anxieties convey a humanist conservatism
that holds on to a liberal autonomous subject: "The ecstatic dissolution
of the body," Scott Bukatman writes, "is counterbalanced by the
recuperative strategies of nar- rative and generic structure within
which the subject maintains his autonomy and power ('her' autonomy and
power is another question)" (244[). As a result of an initial cyberpunk
literature "written for the most part by a small number of white,
middle-class men" (Hollinger 207), the protagonist of masculinist
cyberpunk is often a male hustler, freelance specialist, aging punk, or
console cowboy navigating the material realities of the urban sprawl
and, quite often, the abstract realm of infinite cyberspace. Individual
autonomy of [the male protagonist, however, contrasts with **the
existence of female figures mediated by technological
enhancements**]{.mark} or indistinguishable from digital
software]{.underline}. These two spaces of the 'material' and
'immaterial' mirror an inherent tension within cyberpunk around the
body's role in constituting a postmodern subjectivity, an "oscillation
\[\...\] between a biological-determinist view of the body and a turn to
technologi- cal and cybernetic means in order to escape such
determination" (Foster 11). [**[This oscillation is
"gender-coded]{.mark}**" (Foster 11) in that the [female body seems
inescapably essential, both through its materiality and the historical
significations of said materiality (suc]{.mark}h as maternity and
constituting the object of desire within a heterosexual economy). In
contrast, the ultimate goal of the mascu- line (anti)hero is often to
escape the confinement of the 'meat' (i.e., the body), which he attempts
to varying degrees typically using street-level technology.]{.underline}

Again, [[**this binary between human and technology that cyberpunk
ostensibly sets out to com- plicate** has been problematized in feminist
critiques of science and epistemology]{.mark} which seek to uncover the
ways in which narratives of science historically have conceptualized
**[nature and tech- nology as feminine and culture, and mastery of
technology and science, as masculine]{.mark}**]{.underline}.3 The ra-
cialized, gendered, and classed characters of these dualisms are deeply
humanist in their separation of Man from nature and in turn align people
of color, women, nature, and technology as the 'unanimated' separate
from Man's ability to reason. The conceptual link of the female body to
the realm of the intellectually unanimated, a worldview that includes
both animals and machines, places it in a troubled relationship to the
image of the cyborg and to the imagined space of dis- embodied virtual
reality, the two pillars upon which cyberpunk rests. Consequently,
[[cyberpunk's]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[masculinized myth of the transcended body is frequently rendered
through its juxtaposition with obviously feminized techno-bodies and
techno-spaces]{.underline}]{.mark}. The results are the depiction of an
erot- icized feminine (cyber)technology mastered by a male protagonist,

relationship to their (techno)bodies or conflated with a feminized
cyberspace, on the other.

### Acceleration Alt 

#### Acceleration of cyberpunk tendencies can override the colonial tendencies of capitalism

Hugh Charles **O'Connell 20** \-- is an assistant professor of English
at the University of Massachu- setts Boston. His current research
examines the relationship between speculative fiction and speculative
finance. He is the co-editor with David M. Higgins of Speculative
Finance/Speculative Fiction (CR: The New Centennial Review 19.1). Recent
essays on British and postcolonial science fiction have appeared in The
Cambridge History of Science Fiction (2019), Utopian Studies, Cambridge
Journal of Postcolonial Literary Inquiry, Modern Fiction Studies,

Rather than a 'hacking' or a revision of cyberpunk tropes, Eric D. Smith
argues that the South African author Lauren Beukes instead radicalizes
cyberpunk by accelerating its tendencies.

[Beukes' [cyberpunk]{.mark} [intervenes]{.mark} \[in Csicsery-Ronay's
critique of cyberpunk as the reduction to thrill\] [by **exposing the
ideological underpinnings of this nervous ecstasy**]{.mark} from a
perspective decidedly alternative to that of the still-globalizing first
world. She does so]{.underline}, however, not through simple or
spectacular opposition to the cyberpunk aesthetic but [**t[hrough the
accel- eration of the form to its terminal velocity,]{.mark}** through
appropriating its penchant for cynicism, stereotype, and kinesis and
carrying these to their perdurable limits.]{.underline} (161)

Moreover, the novel eschews the transcendent aspects of cyberspace for a
focus on the somatic consequences of real subsumption. Instead of
figuring cyberspace as an area to be entered, leaving the body behind,
[we see how [**cyberspace instead colonizes the everyday world and the
body**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Here[, [the cellphone becomes the key
object]{.mark} of cyberpunk real subsumption as an appendage to the
body, keeping it [permanently **yoked to the data sphere**]{.mark} as
well as acting as the conduit through which [we provide **free content
and labor**]{.mark}]{.underline} to so many sites (YouTube, Facebook,
Instagram). [It is the ubiquity of the cellphone that hides these
processes of real subsumption, thereby normalizing them **not as labor
but as culture**]{.underline} (and perhaps this is the best example of
the strong Jamesonian thesis of culture as now fully
commodified---culture here in Raymond Williams' sense of a total way of
life).

LiPuma and Lee make the key point that [the [subjective freedoms of
connectivity]{.mark} (access to information and communications
technology) "[are always self-annulling]{.mark} at another and higher
level"]{.underline} (46--47). These are the same "conditions of
encompassment and domination by circula- tory capital and the
infrastructure of the metropole generally" (47). As Shaviro reminds us
in Connected: "[I do not find myself in the network, having fallen or
been thrown. Rather, I exist for the network. I am predestined to it.
From the moment I get connected, I am irreversibly bound to its
protocols and its finality]{.underline}" (29). [As the medium for
extending capitalist real subsump- tion,
information-connective-technologies illustrate how advertising does not
simply operate as]{.underline}

[brainwashing]{.underline} (although it does promote desire). Instead,
**[[it colonizes our bodies by transforming them into means of
information collection and advertising]{.underline}]{.mark}**: On the
one hand for the neoliberal maintenance and marketing of our own brands,
and on the other hand for others in the clothes that we wear, the
products that we purchase and then Instagram ourselves enjoying (the
mere fact that I can use 'Instagram' as a verb in this sentence
demonstrates this invasive fact).

### Hacking Alt

#### Hacking can be a useful heuristic to denaturalize conventions and technologies

Hugh Charles **O'Connell 20** \-- is an assistant professor of English
at the University of Massachu- setts Boston. His current research
examines the relationship between speculative fiction and speculative
finance. He is the co-editor with David M. Higgins of Speculative
Finance/Speculative Fiction (CR: The New Centennial Review 19.1). Recent
essays on British and postcolonial science fiction have appeared in The
Cambridge History of Science Fiction (2019), Utopian Studies, Cambridge
Journal of Postcolonial Literary Inquiry, Modern Fiction Studies,
Paradoxa, and the Los Angeles Review of Books. ("Marxism"The Routledge
Companion to Cyberpunk Culture, Chapter 34, p288) //le

This dissemination of cyberpunk as a cultural dominant and its
transformation to post-cyberpunk has also opened up the possibility of
critiquing the political and aesthetic limits of its reliance on dig-
ital transcendence. Hence, [[it's only with **the negation of
cyberpunk's affirmation** that we can begin to perceive of]{.mark}
something like even a weak utopianism, [the possibility of
possibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. In many ways, as many marxist critics
have noted, this has been the case for post-cyberpunk and especially
African and postcolonial cyberpunk. For example, Bould argues that the
recent spate of Afrocyberpunk films, including Africa Paradis (Amoussou
2006), Bedwin Hacker (El Fani 2003), Les Saignantes (Bekolo 2005), as
well as the better-known works by Neill Blomkamp, sidestep traditional
cyberpunk's re- liance on personal transcendence. "They depict
transgressions of national and corporeal borders," Bould contends, "and
envision resistance to corporate and state power by pitting the tactical
against the strategic \[\...and\] the molecular against the molar"
("Afrocyberpunk" 214). Moreover, in terms of the first three films
listed above, their "conditions of production tend to result in films
that demon- strate \[\...\] the flipside of a cyberpunk world centered
on the flows of capital" (218).

Similarly, [Jillana Enteen argues that Nalo Hopkinson's Midnight Robber
(2000) '[hacks' cyber- punk tropes in order to "**render visible**
current socioeconomic inequities, suggest \[an\] alternative formulation
of the relationship between humans and technology]{.mark}, and increase
the cultural re- pository of ideas that inspire technological and social
development]{.underline}" (263). As such, "[Hopkinson employs [hacking
to **denaturalize cyberpunk conventions**]{.mark}]{.underline}; she also
delineates technologies that expose biases inherent in its present
formulation" (270). In these examples, [African and postco- lonial
post-cyberpunk works to denaturalize the technologies of real
subsumption and the new domineering presence of global finance by
hacking the narrative conventions]{.underline} as well as the tech-
nologies used to promulgate these features of everyday late capitalist
life.

### Links to Cap 

#### Cyberpunk is part of the DNA of modern capitalist culture

From this vantage point, we can argue that cyberpunk is not really about
the "interface of technology with the human subject" (Bukatman 8),
offering "new technological modes of 'being in the world'" (McCaffery
qtd. in Bukatman 8). Instead, [cyberpunk technology is a vector
and]{.underline}

[conduit, and **[cyberpunk is about the subject's ceaseless
invasion]{.mark}** by real subsumption under this new stage of financial
capital.]{.underline} Jameson comes tantalizing close to suggesting as
much in his own belated reading of Neuromancer in The Ancients and the
Postmoderns. Here, he reads Case as caught between the virtual-simulated
realms of both finance/cyberspace and the real subsumption of the fully
capitalized body of simstim, a position which, we have to remember, is
dictated by a corporate-conscious AI residing in a Swiss banking
computer planning its own transcendence from even these most-minimal of
human restraints in the form of the Singularity. And as Bould reminds
us, cyberpunk's notion of the Singularity is perhaps the greatest
fantasy of capital: pre- tending as if human labor never existed. "The
singularity has already happened," Bould contends, "and is constantly
happening, as humans, 'already not-human,' are torn apart by capital,
our selves reduced to those abstractions (labor-power,
consumption-power) which it needs to operate and perpetuate" ("Why"
133).3 This is the defining ideological fantasy critiqued by one of the
most significant post-cyberpunk films, Alex Rivera's Sleep Dealer
(2008), where Mexican laborers in Tijuana cybernetically 'jack in' to
the net in order to control construction robots in San Francisco: "This
is the American Dream, we give the United States what they've always
wanted\... all the work---without the \[migrant\] workers."

What I want to suggest, then, is that rather than disappear, cyberpunk's
defining narrative traits have been extended and disseminated. And here
I think [we need to attend to Derridean readings of this word, [**not
forgetting the masculinist logics** of reproduction]{.mark} via the
seminal and semen, combined with the masculinist aspects of
cyberpunk]{.underline} as critiqued by Nicola Nixon, Jenny Wolmark, and
Karen Cadora, [as well as the patriarchal-penetrating aspects of
neoliberal finan- cialization and [cyberpunk's role, however
unintentional, as **a mediator and disseminator**]{.mark} of the
latter]{.underline}.4 In this light, [[we can see **cyberpunk as part of
the general DNA of late capitalist culture**]{.mark}. Having broken the
spell of cyberpunk as an avant-garde, as an artwork in the modernist
sense, as semi-autonomous, it is free and we are free to see it
disseminated into the mainstream]{.underline} (with all the commodified
and reified overtones that this should suggest) not as a style, but
instead, in Thomas Foster's well-known phrase, as a "sea change into a
more generalized cultural formation" (xiv), or better yet, simply as the
cultural dominant of everyday life under the techno-invasive modes of
real subsumption and finance.

### AT: Cap -- Perm Do Both

#### Anti-capitalism can only be successful when combined with cyberpunk

As Benjamin Noys has recently suggested, [a [return to cyberpunk as the
fiction of finance may help in **confronting the roots of the 2008
financial crisis**]{.mark} and the inability of contemporary fic- tional
forms to address it.]{.underline} This is all the more salient when one
considers the similar theoretical and representational crises in marxist
theory as diagnosed by Edward LiPuma and Benjamin Lee in Financial
Derivatives and the Globalization of Risk, in which, they argue, the
traditional critical tropes of marxism (the labor theory of value and
emphasis on private property, particularly) wither in efficacy in
relation to the immateriality of the derivative and the digital
circulatory systems of speculative finance. [[These present crises---in
capitalism, theory, and representation--- stem from the formative period
of speculative finance]{.mark} in the 1980s, a period that cyberpunk
captured more than any other literary form]{.underline}. Thus, as Mark
Bould contends in relation to William Gibson's Neuromancer (1984),
cyberpunk "inaugurated the SF of multinational capital and corpo- rate
globalization, its depiction of information circulating in cyberspace a
potent metaphor for the global circulation of capital" ("Cyberpunk"
220). Therefore, [a ret[urn to the concepts and conceits of
cyberpunk]{.mark} and their afterlife in so many post-cyberpunk fictions
of AI, acceleration- ism, and virtual reality [is imperative]{.mark} not
only for understanding our present, but [for]{.mark} **[any hopes of a
postcapitalist futurit]{.mark}y**.]{.underline}

To begin, it is first necessary to trace a line of thought that has
significant consequences both for the history of marxism and cyberpunk
as well as their current relationship: What does it mean to take
seriously Jameson's offhand comment that [cyberpunk is the literature of
postmodernism and thus late capitalism?]{.underline} As Fredric Jameson
famously writes in the very first footnote of Postmodernism;

Or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism: "[This is the place to regret
the absence from this book of a chapter on cyberpunk, henceforth, for
many of us, the supreme literary expression if not of postmodernism,
then of late capitalism itself]{.underline}" (419n1). Whatever else we
might want to note about this statement, [it is important for
understanding the history of marxist cyberpunk criticism that we begin
with a starting place that immediately annuls itself. In other words,
[**cyberpunk serves as the absent center of the defining marxist
analysis** of postmodernity, late capitalism, and
culture.]{.mark}]{.underline}

## Posthumanism + Capitalism

### Transhumanism Links

#### Transhumanism reinforces capitalism -- cyberpunk solves

Julia **Grillmayr 20** is a literature and cultural studies scholar as
well as print and radio journalist, based in Vienna and Linz, Austria.
Her postdoc project at the University of Art and Design in Linz (funded
by the Austrian Science Fund FWF) investigates 'scenario thinking' in
contemporary science fiction and futurology (see
<https://scifi-fafo.com>). (Julia, "Posthumanism(s)" The Routledge
Companion to Cyberpunk Culture, Chapter 33, p277-278) //le

In her article "Wrestling with Transhumanism," Hayles adds an important
layer to the posthuman discussion when she recognizes that [even though
[not all versions of transhumanism are guilty of **praising
disembodiment**, they all "perform decontextualizing moves that
over-simplify the situation and carry]{.mark} into the new millennium
[**some of the most questionable aspects of capitalist
ideology**]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark} Hayles's link between
transhumanism's over-simplifications and capitalist ideology is an
important connection because [[transhumanism's feel-good aesthetics
often **mask its own com- mercial interests**]{.mark}. For example,
Bostrom's posthuman scenarios read like bad copy for commer-
cials:]{.underline} ["You are able to sprinkle your conversation with
witty remarks and poignant anecdotes. Your friends remark on how much
more fun you are to be around]{.underline}" (31) and ["\[y\]ou have just
cel- ebrated your 170th birthday and you feel stronger than ever. Each
day is a joy]{.underline}" (32). Perhaps most obvious and extreme in
this respect is bestselling futurist and famous transhumanism proponent

Ray Kurzweil who, paired with physician Terry Grossman, advances
transhumanist visions of longevity---including various dietary
supplements that his readers can conveniently purchase from his and
Grossman's Transcend website. [[Deeply critical of capitalism, it is
thus among cyberpunk's **key functions to push back**]{.mark} against
these sort of transhumanist visions of the posthuman and [to **make
economic inequality visible**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Gibson has
famously remarked in Talk of the Nation, "the fu- ture is already
here---it's just not very evenly distributed" ("Science"), so to ignore
the economic realities underwriting human enhancement technologies and
ideologies risks the persistence and reinforcement of these structural
inequalities.

### Cyberpunk Solves Social Inequalities

#### Cyberpunk forces social inequalities to the forefront -- begins the journey to concrete solutions

While cyberpunk may not entirely fulfill the role of a philosophically
informed opposition to anthropocentrism and global capitalism, it
certainly complicates the streamlined futures that transhumanism
promises. Instead of superhumanly smart and strong posthumans, Sterling
imag- ines that soon "the Monsters would all have lousy night jobs
mopping up at fast-food restaurants" ("Nineties"). [[Cyberpunk makes it
**impossible to ignore social inequalities**]{.mark} that could
potentially be reinscribed by human enhancement. In other words, if
cyberpunk portrays some winners who are living in a future as sketched
by Bostrom, Kurzweil, or other transhumanist advocates, the losers are
at the same time ever-present]{.underline}. Take, for example, Madeline
Ashby's recent cyberpunk novel Company Town (2016). When Hwa, the main
character of Ashby's novel, is told by the ultra-rich Zachariah Lynch
that the lifestyle of fully organic people like her, who will soon "be
nothing more than specimens in a museum of humanity," is a "very brave
choice," Hwa sums up the material conditions for so many: "Choice had
little to do with it. Money was the thing. When you had no money, you
had no choice" (45). Among other successes in the novel, Ashby depicts
Hwa and other characters exploited by economic and social
precariousness. Finally, with

Hwa's transformation into a posthuman "changeling" through advanced
nanotechnology that she catches like a virus, Ashby offers a critical
perspective on how [[becoming-posthuman might have nothing to do with
individual choice]{.mark}, intent, or even consent. In a Cadigan-esque
manner, Hwa can only lament that "\[e\]verything that made me who I am
is gone" (Ashby 283).]{.underline}

In conclusion, it bears noting that [while the discussion of the complex
intersections of cyberpunk sf, transhumanism, and posthumanism
continues**, [this discourse is currently expanding and
changing]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Working from Mark McGurl's essay "The
Posthuman Comedy," Bruce Clarke de- scribes this as a shift "from the
machinic posthuman to the planetary nonhuman" (xii). As has be- come
evident through some of the above-cited examples, [[the endeavor to
understand the merging of humans and machines is fueling broader
discussions of the **relations between the human and the
nonhuman**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This development is visible in Donna J.
Haraway's work. After writing "A Cyborg Manifesto," she soon came to
think of "cyborgs as junior siblings in the much bigger, queer fam- ily
of companion species" ("Companion" 300) and thus started to focus on the
co-evolution of humans and animals under modern (bio)technological
conditions. In sf, this is palpable as a shift "away from a cyberpunk
imaginary, best embodied in Haraway's cyborg \[\...\] and toward another
technocultural expression of scientific progress: One that favors
genetic engineering, xenotrans- plantation, and virology" and is thus
often referred to as "biopunk" (Schmeink 7). [Cyber- and biopunk are of
course **not mutually exclusive**, but are likely to coexist, as
evidenced in the range of texts referenced in this voluminous
collection.]{.underline}

If anything, this ongoing development stresses even further the role of
sf in complicating escap- ist visions of the posthuman future.
[[Cyberpunk may not provide solutions to social]{.mark}, medical, and
environmental [issues, but **it insists on addressing them, instead of
making them disappear**]{.mark} **through an all too simple
technological fix.**]{.underline} As Haraway stresses in her recent book
Staying with the Trouble (2016), in contrast to the bright and clean
futures depicted in transhumanism, she works "with and in sf as
material-semiotic composting, as theory in the mud, as muddle" (31). In
order to dissoci- ate herself from the adherents of a "transhumanist
techno-enhancement," [Haraway also strictly rejects the term
'posthumanism' that she considers "much too easily appropriated by the
blissed- out]{.underline}" (Gane 140). Instead, she playfully proposes
the term "compost": "[[**We are humus**, not Homo, not anthropos; **we
are compost,** not posthuman]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Staying 55).
[[Cyberpunk more often than not gets its hand dirty in the
compost]{.mark} by exploring the complicated ways of 'becoming-with'
nonhu- mans, not least by giving a voice to various nonhuman actors, be
it animals, robots, bioengineered or other bacteria, smart objects, or
disembodied AIs. Even if cyberpunk generally relies neither on
transhumanist nor on critical posthumanist theory and critique**,
[cyberpunk remains ready to engage]{.mark}** [in such a project of
"nonarrogant collaboration with all those in the
muddle]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Staying 56).
