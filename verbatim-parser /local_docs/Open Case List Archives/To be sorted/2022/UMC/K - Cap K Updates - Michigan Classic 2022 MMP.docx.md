From Shareholder to Stakeholder Capitalism: More of the Same? The
political economy that characterizes most of today's world -- capitalism
-- is centuries old, although its most recent form -- neoliberalism --
only became dominant in the 1980s.2 [Neoliberalism's core
elements]{.underline} (trade and financial liberalization, low taxation,
minimal state intervention, strong property rights) [birthed our now
familiar globalized economy, criticized almost at its outset for the
**inequalities it was fomenting**]{.underline}. To WEF founder, Klaus
Schwab, [the problem]{.underline} Labonté 2 International Journal of
Health Policy and Management, 2022, x(x), 1--5 [lay]{.underline} less
with capitalism itself than [with its neoliberal emphasis on maximizing
shareholder value, where economic decisions are based on creating the
greatest return on investment in the shortest time
possible]{.underline}. Schwab's and the WEF's promoted solution is
'stakeholder capitalism,' in which everyone (and not just shareholders)
should have a stake in capitalism's benefits.5 Few might object to the
idea of all gaining (even if not equally) from liberalized market
activities, but as one economist argued, the stakeholder model is
essentially: "...just a way of [bringing the opponents of capitalism to
a common venture of extending its lifespan, while ignoring the system's
**intrinsic and destabilizing profit motive"**]{.underline} (W. Bello,
interview communication, October 27, 2021). As one example, in a
post-pandemic 'Great Reset' wealthy investors are encouraged to invest
in businesses whose activities align with the Sustainable Development
Goals. This, it is said, would allow them to "make a profit and still
save the world."6 [To the extent that such investments go into
non-fossil-fuel renewables]{.underline} this win-win hyperbole is a
partial truth; but with many of these ethical investment portfolios
[being non-compliant with global climate change goals7]{.underline}
[this may simply be 'greenwashing' what remains fundamentally
profit-motivated investing]{.underline}. We might also ask: [What
economic policies and practices enable investors to become
disproportionately wealthy in the first place]{.underline}? As a recent
study noted, the stakeholder capitalism model will do little to
redistribute wealth but will strengthen the private sector's (not
unself-interested and growing) role in global health governance.8 The
Return of the State: Can Governments Mitigate Capitalism's Inherent
Inegalitarianism? The state is certainly a critical 'stakeholder' in
capitalism since its policy choices enable or constrain the actions of
economic actors within and across borders. [The post-1980 drift to
neoliberalism saw the state **increasingly defer to market interests in
efforts to have their countries remain globally
competitive**]{.underline} (T. Jackson, interview communication, October
28, 2021).9 Tax rates fell, [financial markets deregulated, and
inequalities within most countries soared]{.underline}.2 The 2008 global
financial crisis saw a rapid volte-face, with [wealthier country
governments spending trillions of dollars to bail out 'banks too big to
fail]{.underline}.'2 The return of the state was brief, with austerity
measures (fiscal contraction) quickly following to cover the public
costs of rescuing private banks and investors2 at the cost of eroding
health systems that proved ill-prepared for a global pandemic. The
[pandemic saw]{.underline} the state roar back once again, with many
[countries responding with wage support, cash transfer, credit schemes,
tax cuts and delays, support to importers and exporters, policy rate
cuts, support to businesses, and rent subsidies or
deferrals]{.underline}.10 This fuelled speculation of a turning point in
state/market dynamics, which some attributed to the COVID-19 crisis
being different from the one in 2008: "It showed us that the [people who
matter most in society]{.underline}, the ones who protect our lives and
care for us, the ones we applauded from our doorsteps during the
pandemic, yet they [were...left behind in terms of wages, security, the
value of their jobs, their status in society]{.underline}" (T. Jackson,
interview communication, October 28, 2017). Certainly, the need for
greater public investment in health and social protection is an
undisputed outcome of the pandemic, especially given how government
responses to COVID-19 increased women's care burdens, employment losses
and experiences of domestic violence.10-12 Others saw massive government
interventions in the economy as demonstrating that: "...[all that
neoliberal talk about government intervention is bad, bad, bad just got
thrown out the window...what we've seen is the ideological assumption of
neoliberalism laid low"]{.underline} (W. Bello, interview communication,
October 27, 2021). Early post-pandemic recovery plans for those
countries with the requisite fiscal capacities appeared to embody such
transformative optimism. The original US multi-trillion Green New Deal
promised substantial environmental protection, a rapid shift away from
fossil fuels, and expansive new social spending.13 When it was later
tabled as a '[Build Back Better']{.underline} plan its [ambitions were
trimmed substantially, and then even more due to fossil fuel industry
lobbying and the rise in right-wing populism]{.underline}.14 There are
concerns that polarized politics in the USA may prevent it from ever
being enacted.15 The EU's 'Next Generation' plan16 has similar
intentions to be green and socially more just and, while insufficiently
generous,17 it fares better than its American counterpart. It could
still be undone by the EU's own right-wing drifts and, with geopolitical
tensions rising globally, notably [following Russia's invasion of
Ukraine, the EU and many other countries are **pivoting back to energy
(fossil fuel**) independence, questioning their 2021 commitments to
achieve net-zero emissions by 2050]{.underline}.18

### Impacts - War

#### Capitalism drives war -- cycles of deconstruction and reconstruction provide outlets for over-accumulation

**Robinson '22 \--** a distinguished professor of sociology, global
studies and Latin American studies at the University of California at
Santa Barbara (William I. Robinson, "Global Capitalism Has Become
Dependent on War-Making to Sustain Itself," section: "Militarized
Accumulation", truthout, 4/24/22,

//EH☭

[The Russian invasion]{.underline} --- brutal, reckless and condemnable
by any standard --- has [sparked debate on NATO's proposed expansion
into Ukraine]{.underline} and the role that it played in motivating the
Kremlin. [U.S. officials were keenly aware,]{.underline} in fact, that
[the drive to expand NATO to Russian borders would eventually push
Moscow into a military conflict.]{.underline} "We examine a wide range
of nonviolent measures that could exploit Russia's actual
vulnerabilities and anxieties as a way of stressing Russia's military
and economy and the regime's political standing at home and abroad,"
notes a 2019 study by the RAND Corporation, a Pentagon-affiliated think
tank. "The steps we examine would not have either defense or deterrence
as their prime purpose," it states, but rather, "these steps are
conceived of as elements in a campaign designed to unbalance the
adversary, leading Russia to compete in domains or regions where the
United States has a competitive advantage, and causing Russia to
overextend itself militarily or economically." But the provocation could
not be reduced to geopolitical competition, however important, as most
observers were keen to do. Missing from the larger picture was the
[centrality of militarized accumulation]{.underline} --- of [endless
low- and high-intensity warfare, simmering conflicts, civil strife and
policing --- to the global political economy]{.underline}.
[M]{.underline}ilitarized [a]{.underline}ccumulation [refers to a
situation in which a **global war economy relies on the state to
organize war-making, social control and repression to sustain capital
accumulation**]{.underline} in the face of chronic stagnation and
saturation of global markets. These state-organized [practices are
outsourced to transnational corporate capital, involving the fusion of
private accumulation with state militarization]{.underline} in order to
sustain the process of capital accumulation. [**Cycles of destruction
and reconstruction provide ongoing outlets for over-accumulated
capital**;]{.underline} that is, these cycles [open up new profit-making
opportunities for transnational capitalists]{.underline} seeking ongoing
opportunities [to]{.underline} profitably [reinvest the enormous amounts
of cash they have accumulated.]{.underline} There is a [convergence
in]{.underline} this process of [global capitalism's political need for
social control and repression]{.underline} in the face of mounting
popular discontent worldwide [and its economic need to perpetuate
accumulation]{.underline} in the face of stagnation. **[Wars provide
critical economic stimulus]{.underline}**. They have [historically
pulled the capitalist system out of accumulation crises]{.underline}
while they serve to [deflect attention from political tensions and
problems of legitimacy.]{.underline} It took [World War II]{.underline}
to finally [lift]{.underline} world [capitalism out of the Great
Depression.]{.underline} The [Cold War legitimated a half century of
expanding military budgets]{.underline} and the [Iraq/Afghanistan wars,
the longest in history, helped keep the economy]{.underline} sputtering
along [in the face of chronic stagnation]{.underline} in the first two
decades of the century. From [the anti-Communist fervor of the Cold
War]{.underline}, to [the "war on terror,"]{.underline} then
[the]{.underline} so-called [New Cold War]{.underline}, and now [the
Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}, the transnational elite, led
by [Washington, have had to conjure up one enemy after another to
legitimate militarized accumulation]{.underline} and [deflect crises of
state legitimacy and capitalist hegemony onto external enemies and
contrived threats.]{.underline} The events of September 11, 2001, marked
the start of an era of a permanent global war in which [logistics,
warfare, intelligence, repression, surveillance and even military
personnel are more and more]{.underline} the [privatized]{.underline}
domain of transnational capital. The [Pentagon budget increased 91
percent]{.underline} in real terms [between]{.underline}
19[98]{.underline} [and]{.underline} 20[11]{.underline}, while
[worldwide]{.underline}, total state [military budget]{.underline}
outlays [grew]{.underline} by 50 percent from 2006 to 2015, from \$[1.4
trillion to more than \$2 trillion]{.underline}. (This figure does not
take into account the [hundreds of billions]{.underline} of dollars
[spent on intelligence]{.underline}; contingency operations; policing;
bogus wars against immigrants, terrorism and drugs; and "homeland
security.") During this time, [military-industrial complex profits
quadrupled]{.underline}. However, focusing just on state military
budgets only gives us a part of the picture of the global war economy.
As I showed in my 2020 book, The Global Police State, the various wars,
conflicts and campaigns of social control and repression around the
world involve the [fusion of private accumulation with state
militarization]{.underline}. In this relationship, [the state
facilitates the expansion of opportunities for private capital to
accumulate through militarization]{.underline}, such as by [facilitating
global weapons sales by military-industrial-security firms]{.underline},
the amounts of which have reached unprecedented levels. Global [weapons
sales]{.underline} by the top 100 weapons manufacturers and military
service companies [increased by 38 percent between 2002 and
2016]{.underline} and can be [expected to escalate further]{.underline}
in the face of a prolonged war in Ukraine. By 2018, [private for-profit
military companies employed some 15 million people around the
world]{.underline}, while another 20 million people worked in private
security worldwide. The [private security]{.underline} (policing)
business is one of the fastest-growing economic sectors in many
countries and has come to [dwarf public security around the
world]{.underline}. The amount spent on private security in 2003, the
year of the invasion of Iraq, was 73 percent higher than that spent in
the public sphere, and three times as many persons were employed in
private forces as in official law enforcement agencies. In half of the
world's countries, private security agents outnumber police officers.
These [corporate soldiers and police were deployed to]{.underline} guard
corporate property, provide personal security for executives and their
families; collect data; conduct police, paramilitary, counterinsurgency
and surveillance operations; [carry out mass crowd control and
repression of protesters]{.underline}; run private detention and
interrogation facilities; manage prisons and participate in outright
warfare. Now, [these same private military and security firms are
pouring into Ukraine,]{.underline} with some mercenary companies
[offering between \$1,000 and \$2,000 a day]{.underline} for those with
combat experience. The Russian invasion has accelerated but did not
originate the ongoing surge in military spending around the world. It is
notable that state [military spending worldwide skyrocketed
in]{.underline} the wake of the [2008 global financial
collapse]{.underline} even beyond the post-9/11 spending hike, rising
from about \$1.5 billion in 2008 to over \$2 trillion in 2022. The fact
that this explosion in spending coincides perfectly with continued
worldwide stagnation following the Great Recession suggests that the
[heightened militarization of the global economy is as much]{.underline}
or more [a response to]{.underline} this chronic [stagnation than to
perceived security threats]{.underline}. If bursts of [**militarized
accumulation**]{.underline} (such as that unleashed by 9/11, then by the
2008 financial collapse, and now by the Russian invasion) help offset
the overaccumulation crisis further into the future, they are [also
high-risk bets that heighten worldwide tensions and **push the world
dangerously towards all-out international conflagration**]{.underline}.

#### Capitalism causes war -- crisis justifies military accumulation

**Robinson** '**22** \-- a distinguished professor of sociology, global
studies and Latin American studies at the University of California at
Santa Barbara (William I., "Global Capitalism Has Become Dependent on
War-Making to Sustain Itself", "Truth Out", 4-24-22,
[https://truthout.org/articles/global-capitalism-has-become-dependent-on-war-making-to-sustain-itself/\]](https://truthout.org/articles/global-capitalism-has-become-dependent-on-war-making-to-sustain-itself/%5d)
A.G

[This crisis of global capitalism is economic, or structural, one of
chronic stagnation in the global economy. But it is also political: a
crisis of state legitimacy and capitalist hegemony. The system is moving
towards "a general crisis of capitalist rule" as billions of people
around the world face uncertain struggles for survival and question a
system they no longer see as legitimate. Historically, wars have pulled
the capitalist system out of crisis while they serve to deflect
attention from political tensions and problems of legitimacy.
Economically, global capitalism faces what is known in technical
language as "overaccumulation": a situation in which the economy has
produced]{.underline} --- or has the capacity to produce --- [great
quantities of wealth but the market cannot absorb this wealth because of
escalating inequality. Capitalism by its very nature will]{.underline}
produce abundant wealth yet [polarize that wealth and generate ever
greater levels of social inequality]{.underline} unless offset by
redistributive policies. [The level of global social polarization and
inequality now experienced is without precedent. In 2018, the richest 1
percent of humanity controlled more than half of the world's wealth
while the bottom 80 percent had to make do with just 5 percent. The
international development agency Oxfam reported in January that during
the first two years of the coronavirus pandemic, the 10 richest men in
the world more than doubled their fortunes, from \$700 billion to \$1.5
trillion, while 99 percent of humanity saw a fall in their income and
160 million more people fell into poverty. Such inequalities end up
undermining the stability of the system as the gap grows between what is
--- or could be --- produced and what the market can absorb. The extreme
concentration of the planet's wealth in the hands of the few and the
accelerated impoverishment and dispossession of the majority means that
the transnational capitalist class, or TCC, has increasing difficulty in
finding productive outlets to unload enormous amounts of surplus it
accumulated. In the years leading up to the pandemic, there was a steady
rise in underutilized capacity and a slowdown in industrial production
around the world. The surplus of accumulated capital with nowhere to go
expanded rapidly. Transnational corporations recorded record profits
during the 2010s at the same time that corporate investment declined.
Along with militarized accumulation, the TCC has turned to unprecedented
levels of financial speculation and to debt-driven growth to sustain
profit-making in the face of the crisis. If left unchecked,
overaccumulation results in crisis --- in stagnation, recessions,
depressions, social upheavals and war --- just what we are experiencing
right now. But there is a related dynamic at work in the global war
economy: the need for dominant groups to suppress mass discontent and
deflect the crisis of state legitimacy. International frictions escalate
as states, in their efforts to retain legitimacy, seek to sublimate
social and political tensions and to keep the social order from
fracturing. All around the world, a "people's Spring" has taken off.
From Chile to Lebanon, Iraq to India, France to the United States, Haiti
to Nigeria, South Africa to Colombia, Jordan to Sri Lanka, waves of
strikes and mass protests have proliferated and, in some instances,
appear to be acquiring an anti-capitalist character. Wars and external
enemies allow the ruling groups to deflect attention away from domestic
malaise in their effort to maintain a grip on power as the crisis
deepens. The transnational elite, led by Washington, have had to conjure
up one enemy after another to legitimate militarized accumulation and
deflect crises of state legitimacy and capitalist hegemony onto external
enemies and contrived threats. In the U.S., this sublimation has
involved efforts to channel social unrest towards scapegoated
communities such as immigrants or other marginalized groups --- this is
one key function of racism and was a core component of the Trump
government's political strategy --- or towards an external enemy such as
China or Russia, which had clearly become a cornerstone of the Biden
government's strategy well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. U.S.
presidents historically reach their highest approval ratings when they
launch wars. George W. Bush reached an all-time-high of 90 percent in
2001 as his administration geared up to invade Afghanistan, and his
father George H.W. Bush achieved an 89 percent approval rating in 1991,
right as the U.S. declared the end of its (first) invasion of Iraq and
the "liberation of Kuwait." It is unlikely that an increasing
militarization of the world economy can in the long run offset either
the economic or the political dimensions of the crisis of global
capitalism. Global capitalism is emerging from the coronavirus pandemic
with more inequality, more authoritarianism, more militarization, and
more civic and political strife. In the U.S., class struggle is heating
up, with a wave of strikes and of unionization drives in Amazon,
Starbucks, and elsewhere in the gig economy. The current inflationary
spiral and the escalation of class struggle in the United States and
around the world point to the inability of the ruling groups to contain
the expanding crisis. The drive by the capitalist state to **externalize
the political fallout of the crisis** increases the danger that
international tensions and localized conflicts such as in Ukraine will
**snowball into broader international conflagrations of unforeseen
consequences**. As the Ukraine crisis continues to drag on and the
global revolt escalates, there will be a radical reconfiguration of
global geopolitical alignments to the drumbeat of escalating turbulence
in the world economy that will feed new political upheavals and violent
conflicts, making global capitalism all the more volatile. While it is
hard to imagine a return to the status quo antebellum in Eastern Europe,
in the larger picture, **the Ukraine crisis is not the cause but a
consequence of the general crisis of global capitalism**. That crisis
will only get worse. Fasten your seat belts; it will get much
worse.]{.underline}

### Capitalism Unsustainable

#### Capitalism is unsustainable---it's [self-destructive]{.underline} and obfuscates the causes of existential risks

**Chomsky & Mascirota 21 \--** Noam Chomsky is a major figure in
analytic philosophy and founder of cognitive science and David Masciotra
is a political columnist with Salon and has also written for The
Atlantic and The Washington Post. ("Dismantle all of this stuff: A
conversation with Noam Chomsky," *Los Angeles Book Review*, 5/14/21,

// E.H.☭

One of the simple but profound statements in the book is that the
"problem isn't individual, but institutional." [Mainstream political
discussion tends to obsess over individuals rather than
institutions.]{.underline} There are many Americans who are angry about
politics but aren't exactly sure why or how to direct their rage. Is
part of that because --- as much as, say, Biden is preferable to Trump
--- the overall problem isn't individual, it's institutional? There are
differences, which are significant, but basically institutions place
tight constraints on what can happen. Let's take the most urgent issue
that has arisen in human history: [the destruction of the environment.
If we don't take care of that in the next couple of decades, nothing
else matters]{.underline}. We'll be off on an [irreversible course of
self-destruction]{.underline}. Well, there are institutions and
individuals. There's the CEO of ExxonMobil. There's Jamie Dimon, who
runs JPMorgan Chase. They make decisions, and the decisions to some
extent reflect their own goals, priorities, sentiments, and so on. But
they are narrowly constrained. So, for example, [the CEO of ExxonMobil
surely knows as much about global warming]{.underline} as you or I do,
probably a lot more, at least if he reads the [materials that come to
him from his own scientists and engineers, and they've known it for 50
years. ExxonMobil scientists were in the lead]{.underline}, back before
many people were warning about the extraordinary dangers of heating in
the environment. In fact, when James Hansen, a [famous geoscientist,
made a speech in 1988 warning of the threat of global
warming,]{.underline} putting it into the public realm[, ExxonMobil
responded with significant efforts to undermine the idea that there is a
threat]{.underline}. They didn't do it stupidly. They didn't deny it,
because that would have been easily refuted. What they did is [try to
develop doubt]{.underline} --- ["Maybe we don't know," "We haven't
looked into clouds," "Let's put off any big decisions so we can have a
richer society," "We might have to do something about it a long time
from now," etc. They all knew that was nonsense.]{.underline} They all
knew that if we don't do something about it quickly, [we are in severe
danger.]{.underline} Back to your question. Suppose a different
individual CEO came in and said, "Let's tell the population the truth.
Let's tell them that we are destroying the prospects for organized human
life on earth. Let's tell them that we are going to stop doing it. We're
going to move to renewable energy, because we care about your
grandchildren and ours." He would be out in five minutes. [That's part
of the institutional structure. If you aren't maximizing profit and
market share, you aren't going to stand.]{.underline} Of course, there
is a point to criticizing individuals, but the real point is that,
[within the system, they don't have a lot of choices]{.underline}.
Therefore, we have to ask, "[What is it about the structure of our
institutions that is leading us in this direction]{.underline}?" Let's
take another current example, right in the headlines. We are in the
midst of a [pandemic]{.underline}. It [is well understood]{.underline},
across the board, that unless vaccines are provided quickly to the poor,
suffering areas of the world, such as parts of Africa, it is going to be
a disaster, not only for them, but for us. Mutations will take place. It
is unpredictable, but some might be lethal. They'll get back to Europe
and the United States, and we'll all be in deep trouble. So, we have a
choice. [We can work on a people's vaccine, sending the vaccine freely
and openly to the people]{.underline} of Africa. That's good for them,
of course, but it will also [protect us from future
disaster]{.underline}. That's one choice. [The other choice is to
protect the profits of the major pharmaceutical
corporations,]{.underline} already loaded with profits because of the
highly protectionist elements of the mislabeled "free trade agreements."
[Which are we pursuing?]{.underline} Not just us, but Europe as well.
The idea is [you work for yourself, for the system of power within your
society, and if it kills people elsewhere, that's someone else's
problem]{.underline}. That is [the way the institutions
work]{.underline}. In fact, if you look at the details, it is pretty
shocking. Imagine yourself a rational observer from outer space watching
this species. Take a look at the United States, which has one of the
best --- or least bad --- records on the vaccine. There happens to be [a
surplus of vaccines in the United States]{.underline}, because the FDA
has not yet authorized the use of AstraZeneca, and there's a large extra
supply. So, [Biden]{.underline} did the sensible thing. He [dispensed
them to]{.underline} other countries. Which countries? The first one is
[Canada, which is the world's champion in storing unused
vaccines]{.underline} that it will never be able to use because it has
hoarded them way beyond any potential use. So, that's the first
recipient. The second recipient is [Mexico, as part of a bribe to
violate international law and minimal ethics by keeping desperate
refugees away from our border]{.underline}. This isn't because Biden is
a bad person. He seems like a nice guy. [It is]{.underline} just [the
way]{.underline} that [institutions structure decisions]{.underline}.
That said, there are different forces operating on how decisions are
structured. There are the corporate boardrooms, and there are the
activists in the streets. Who is going to win? That's the issue, and
it's not subtle. Go back to the beginning of [this 40-year assault on
the general population]{.underline} called
"[neoliberalism]{.underline}." It was pretty obvious at the start. You
may not be old enough to have heard it, but I'm sure you've read about
Reagan's inaugural address in 1981. The punchline was, "Government is
the problem, not the solution." Okay, so if government is not the
solution, who is the solution? Where will decisions be made if not in
government? Does it take a genius to figure this out? They'll be made in
corporate boardrooms. So, in other words, [we shift decisions from
government]{.underline} --- which whatever its flaws, is, at least,
partially responsive to the general population --- [to private
tyrannies]{.underline}, which are totally unaccountable to the public,
and which are dedicated, explicitly --- there's no secret about it ---
[to maximizing]{.underline} what's called "[shareholder
value]{.underline}": dividends, benefits to management. That's their
task. The name for that in the United States is "libertarianism." All of
these are ways in which, to go back to my and Marv's course, "common
sense" is instituted. We happen to start with Gramsci. We go back to
earlier sources, even David Hume's "Of the First Principles of
Government." These themes run through, and it is understood that you
have to impose common sense. You have to manufacture consent. As
progressive democratic theorists have argued, "The people are too stupid
and ignorant to do what is in their own interest. So, we the responsible
men have to make decisions for them." Of course, the intellectuals and
the responsible men are actually following the dictates of private
power. They don't like that part of the story. They like to see
themselves as running the show. In my lifetime, I've seen it over and
over. During the Kennedy and Johnson years, the technocratic and
meritocratic elite, my colleagues from Harvard and MIT, were flocking
down to Washington to show how the world should be run. Well, in
[Vietnam]{.underline}, we saw what came of that. It [was not
unpredictable]{.underline}. Those of us in the streets were warning of
it all along. Now, it is the same. [Neoliberalism]{.underline}, whatever
is in the minds of people who advocate for it, maybe they don't even
think about it, [is an explicit effort]{.underline}, and it is evident
from the structure, [to hand power to private institutions, which are
dedicated to self-enrichment.]{.underline} It would be obvious to a
10-year-old, even if economists don't see it, because they have some
theory that says it leads to "Pareto optimality." Whatever. We have 40
years of experience, and we can see what's happened. It was totally
predictable. To give you just one example, you may have seen it, but a
couple of months ago the RAND Corporation did a [detailed study trying
to determine how much wealth was transferred from the working class and
middle class to the superrich during the 40 neoliberal
years.]{.underline} They [estimated \$47 trillion]{.underline}. Some
call it "transfer." ["Robbery" is a better term.]{.underline} Meanwhile,
the top 0.1 percent of the population doubled their share of total
wealth from 10 percent to 20 percent. Take a look at the effects: the
majority of the population gets by paycheck to paycheck. Real wages have
stagnated for 40 years. [The gains of productivity growth concentrate in
very few pockets]{.underline}. [This leads to]{.underline} what you
mentioned before --- [unfocused anger]{.underline}. Is it surprising?
[People aren't told what is really robbing them]{.underline}. Instead,
they are told that it is immigrants, Blacks, some pedophiles from outer
space, if you believe QAnon. [Anything but what is actually
happening]{.underline}. That's another mode of manufacturing consent and
establishing "common sense." The job of people like you, activists on
the streets, people who are trying to change the world for the better,
is to dismantle all of this stuff. It is to get people to see what is
not that far from right in front of their eyes. None of it is very
profound. You can talk about it to high school students. They often
understand it better than graduate students at major universities, who
have been more indoctrinated. As we discuss in the book, this is a point
George Orwell made. Something that not many people read but should is
the introduction to Animal Farm. Animal Farm is seen as safe, because it
is a satire of the totalitarian enemy. The introduction, which was not
initially published, is addressed to the people of England. Orwell warns
not to feel too self-righteous, because in free England, unpopular ideas
can be suppressed without the use of force. He calls it "literary
censorship in England," and one of the means he describes is simply a
good education. You go to the best schools, like Oxford and Cambridge
(similar to Harvard and Yale), and have it instilled in you that there
are certain things that it just wouldn't do to say, or even think about.
It is funny the way it works. A couple of days ago I had a talk with a
group of Latin American activists. They were from all over Latin
America. Well, just for fun, I read for them a column that appeared in
The New York Times that day by one of their top foreign affairs
specialists. It was about how the United States has been committed to

**[Capitalism is an unsustainable economic system.]{.underline}** That
idea may seem radical or extreme, particularly since the vast majority
of us have been taught about and regularly experience neoliberal
economics, [but the truth is our current economic system is designed for
consumption and growth, creating unsustainable conditions that are
depleting our planet.]{.underline} To further understand and explore
this concept, Circular Triangle's Executive Director, Jennifer Hill,
recently interviewed Associate Research Professor of Economic History at
the Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy, [Dirk
Philipsen](https://sanford.duke.edu/people/faculty/philipsen-dirk), for
his thoughts and expertise. Philipsen, a political economist and
historian, has been working in the sustainability arena for thirty years
and has written extensively about sustainability and economic metrics.
The interview began with what Phillipsen described as the five million
dollar question, "What does sustainability mean to you?" Unsurprisingly,
there are a lot of different definitions. Philipsen explained that
initially sustainability came out of conversations concerned about the
limits to growth. Therefore from the very beginning, in the political
spirit, it is a question with an economic dimension. Philipsen said that
the term originated in the German forest industry by a ranger who wanted
to maintain a forest in a way that could serve future generations the
same way it serves the current. "Ultimately it is trying to figure out a
way to run an economy and run a society in a way\... so that we have in
the 7th generation the same kinds of opportunities that you and I have
today." Specifically, sustainability means getting away from depletion
and pollution, from degradation, destruction, and moving towards a
circular economy. "If someone cares about sustainability, why should
they also care about economics?", Hill asked next. Phillipsen expressed
his difficulty conceiving of anyone that does not care about
sustainability, stating that if you care about the future of our
children and grandchildren you have to care about sustainability because
it is the proposition that we leave behind a world that provides equal
or better opportunities. However, "[we are increasingly leaving behind a
burning trash heap," and the reason why is mostly because of our
economic system.]{.underline} Phillipsen further explained that [our
current economic system does not know how to care for the future. Its
one purpose is to create profit and growth through "extracting and
exploiting and producing and creating evermore output," ultimately
producing for the trash dump. If our current economic system works this
way because it was designed for consumption]{.underline} and growth, we
could also make it work a different way, Hill notes, further adding that
we can choose a different economic model with different outcomes. "I
describe waste as not a bug in the system but a feature of the system;
it is designed to create waste and therefore it does." "I describe waste
as not a bug in the system but a feature of the system; it is designed
to create waste and therefore it does." The biggest elephant in the room
is that the growth regime of our current economic system is not only
unsustainable, it is logically impossible. Phillipsen turns to a book
"Doughnut Economics," by [Kate
Raworth](https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/), in which she describes
that "sweet spot" in the center of a doughnut where everyone has what
they need to thrive without exceeding the limits of the ecosystem. Her
book also examines the graph of exponential growth. Considered to be
healthy and robust by economists, the United States currently has a
growth rate of about 3%. At this rate, the economy (meaning consumption)
would have to double every 25 years. Phillipsen states that this simply
cannot happen no matter how much we innovate and improve efficiency.
"[This is a system that, more than any other system ever, benefits a
shrinking number of people and we are now at a point where 8 people in
the world have as much wealth as the bottom 50 percent (4 billion) of
all people combined." He continues to highlight the levels of
inequality, "\...you can basically throw out everything we believe about
prosperity, freedom, democracy, justice \... all of that goes out the
window."]{.underline} And yet, conservatives, liberals, and socialists
have all subscribed to this idea of exponential growth. Phillipsen
argues that [we are already at a point where economic growth comes with
more costs than benefits by destroying and exploiting, alienating, and
producing inequalities.]{.underline} However, we continue to live in a
system that was deliberately designed to require growth. "Capitalism
cannot function without growth and so here is the big thing that nobody
wants to talk about and yet we have to, which is, if we can't have
growth we have to change capitalism." Perhaps the biggest challenge to
making a change, is not so much designing an alternative economic model,
as Philipsen states, but rather recruitment and organizing. "How do you
get people to give themselves permission to imagine something different
and better, because you and I and everybody in the world has never
experienced anything other than capitalism. And to figure out a way to
make it politically possible, to overcome the massively concentrated
power and control in the hands of capital. That\'s a big step."

### Alt -- Degrowth

#### **Only alternative is degrowth through socialist movements -- ecosystem collapse imminent**

\--decoupling and recycling are insufficient

Degrowth/Post-growth: Should We Build Back at All? Two common elements
in many post-pandemic plans are commitments to [decouple economic
growth]{.underline} from carbon intensity, and to embrace a '[circular
economy']{.underline} in which all goods are reused or repurposed to
reduce material throughput and to eliminate (or massively reduce) waste.
Such measures are essential, but [many environmental economists are
sceptical that they are sufficient]{.underline}. [They also allow
societies to avoid confronting 'an inconvenient truth'\[1\]: That
**capitalism's growth imperative is predicated on ever increasing levels
of material consumption**.]{.underline} The [human population already
consumes annually 1.7 times the ecological resources the world can
regenerate. If everyone consumed at the level of OECD countries it would
require the resources of 4.7 earths]{.underline},21 even before
accounting for the environmental damages such consumption generates. A
relatively new concept has entered the lexicon of environmental
economics: [degrowth]{.underline}\[2\], which [captures the importance
of reducing aggregate global consumption levels **to avoid catastrophic
ecosystem collapse**]{.underline}. The bulk of this [responsibility lies
with citizens, governments, and corporate actors in the]{.underline}
historically over-consuming [Global North]{.underline},32 partly [to
make space for those in the Global South to reach consumption levels
compatible with healthy life expectancies]{.underline} while remaining
within safe planetary limits: "...it's abundantly clear it's in the
poorest parts of the world that income growth makes a huge difference to
prosperity. Life expectancy increases. Infant mortality decreases.
Maternal morbidity decreases. Participation in education
increases...that's where growth makes a difference" (T. Jackson,
interview communication, October 28, 2017). Labonté 4 International
Journal of Health Policy and Management, 2022, x(x), 1--5 The
implications of such a transition are enormous. [The burden of change
rests heaviest on the world's wealthiest]{.underline} regardless of
which country they may live in. Their carbon emissions and consumption
levels massively exceed those of the majority of the world's population,
indicative of the link between rising economic inequality and
environmental devastation.33 But a degrowth (or 'fair growth') economy
will demand substantial change for hundreds of millions, and although:
"...**[degrowth is the only alternative at this point in
time]{.underline}**, [there will need to be political and social
psychological transformations from societies that have been weaned on
overconsumption.]{.underline} I will not underestimate this cost
\[since\] w[e're talking about transformations in the way that we have
structured our lives"]{.underline} (W. Bello, interview communication,
October 27, 2021). Others describe this as transitioning to a
post-growth economy, one in which the pursuit of 'prosperity' replaces
that of growth: "[Many of our problems, both social and structural and
environmental, arise from the idea that progress is about increasing
productivity]{.underline}, the speed with which we create material goods
and services, distribute them to people to buy and throw away as fast as
possible, the belief that this material sense of productivity and
progress is what human prosperity is really about. But what we saw
through the pandemic is that health is really the meaning of prosperity.
Health is the foundation for prosperity(T. Jackson, interview
communication, October 28, 2017). This requires a very different
economy: "...a care economy, one that enriches us as well as saving
lives. It's a lower carbon economy, with a lower footprint because it is
about engagement and attention and time in the service of each other"
(T. Jackson, interview communication, October 28, 2017). Such an economy
is an extension of what: "...feminist economists have always talked
about. There is the direct care which is looking after people... Then
there's extended care...doing things that help in adaptation to climate
change...it is essential work that is being done in unpaid fashion by a
significant part of the population" (J. Ghosh, interview communication,
November 14, 2021).\[3\] Towards a Post-growth Caring Economy: Can We
Challenge the Rise in Autocratic Regimes? [Transforming from a
consumption-based capitalism to a sustainable caring economy requires
governments willing to discipline markets for public good purposes, and
to initiate tax and fiscal policies that radically redistribute access
to the resources people need for healthy lives]{.underline}. The
immediate challenge to this aspirational goal is reversing the fifteen
years' worldwide decline in democratic accountability and parallel rise
in authoritarian rule.34 One of the pandemic's ironies is that even as
it increased the state's role in health and economic protection, it
incentivized alt-right populism and provided opportunities for autocrats
to increase their grip on power. As Walden Bello, a sociologist and
economist who was interviewed for this editorial, noted: "We are in a
race between the forces of the far right and progressive forces \[which
threaten\] any sort of coordinated global action on climate" (W. Bello,
interview communication, October 27, 2021). In response, Bello ran as a
vice-presidential candidate in the May 2022 Philippines elections in an
effort to avoid that country's "resurgence of authoritarianism." He did
not win, but remains committed to the scale of transition needed for a
survivable post-pandemic economy, one in which [democratic participation
must remain strong: "We can't leave it just to the
politicians]{.underline}. We've got to have civil society stepping in
because if we leave it to the usual actors, we're not going to get
anywhere" (W. Bello, interview communication, October 27, 2021). Even as
the space for such participation is under authoritarian attack, the
importance of civil society efforts to retain and expand it is more
important now than in the pre-pandemic period. We know the political
economy tools that can bring us closer to what the Sustainable
Development Goals describe as 'the world we want.' [But only organized
citizen demand will create the political will to adopt these
tools,]{.underline} with recent history bringing us evidence of
unwavering activism in global climate strikes, [Black Lives Matter, buen
vivir and peasant's movements, and poor people's campaigns worldwide.
The **post-pandemic public health imperative now is to protect and
support such movements**]{.underline}.35
