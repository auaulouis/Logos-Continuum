### Notes

Thanks so much to Rohan, Derek, Sara, Claire, Sophia, Henry, and Julia
who all cut cards for this supplement!

General Notes: These cards are not necessarily in order of good to bad
-- read through the warrants and pick the ones that work best for you

AT NATO Checks Notes: This card basically says that Turkey has cut off
all communications with Greece, not that NATO cannot check -- you will
want to expand upon this card to say that Turkey is unwilling to engage
in cooperation over Greece, and the card proves that.

Erdogan threatens to \'freeze\' Sweden and Finland\'s NATO membership,"

[Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday once again
**threatened to stand in the way of Finland and Sweden joining NATO**
--- a day before he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in
Iran]{.underline}.

[\"I would like to remind once again that if these countries do not take
the necessary steps to fulfill our conditions, we will freeze the
(accession) process]{.underline},\" [Erdogan
said](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/turkey-warns-freeze-sweden-finlands-nato-process-87014705) in
a televised addressed, per the Associated Press. \"Our stance on this
issue is very clear. The rest is up to them.\"

[Turkey has accused the Nordic countries of being too friendly **with
Kurdish militant groups** it considers to be
**terrorists**,]{.underline} while also taking issue with embargoes on
arms exports. Along these lines, Turkey initially said it would block
Finland and Sweden from joining the alliance. NATO enlargement requires
unanimous agreement from all current members. [But Turkey dropped its
objections last month after coming to an **agreement** with Finland and
Sweden.]{.underline}

[\"Turkey, Finland and Sweden have signed a memorandum that addresses
Turkey\'s concerns, including around arms exports and the fight against
terrorism,\"]{.underline} NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg [said at the
time](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/28/turkey-lifts-objections-to-finland-and-swedens-nato-bid). 

[After both Scandinavian countries [submitted
applications](https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-and-finland-officially-apply-for-nato-defying-russias-threats-2022-4) and
Turkey said it was dropping its objections, NATO [formally
invited](https://www.businessinsider.com/nato-formally-invites-sweden-finland-to-become-members-2022-6) Finland
and Sweden to join the alliance in late June.]{.underline} The next step
in the process is for the legislatures of all 30 members to ratify
Finland and Sweden\'s accession.

Finland and Sweden --- two historically neutral or militarily
non-aligned countries --- moved to join NATO as a direct response to
Russia\'s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, marking one of the most
significant consequences of Putin acting on his imperialistic ambitions.
Indeed, Russia\'s war has unified the West in historic ways. 

[But autocratic leaders like **Erdogan** who hold sway in NATO ---
but [tend to count Putin as a
friend](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/29/world/europe/erdogan-putin-turkey-russia.html) ---
have **exposed cracks in that unity**. ]{.underline}

As he met with Putin and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Iran on
Tuesday, [Erdogan once again zeroed in on Kurdish militant
groups]{.underline}.

[During a joint press conference with Raisi, the Turkish president said
militias cause \"great trouble\" for both Iran and Turkey. \"We should
fight against these terrorist organisations in solidarity and
alliance,\" he said, [per the Moscow
Times.](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/07/19/putin-in-iran-for-syria-summit-overshadowed-by-ukraine-war-a78336)]{.underline}

[**Turkey has been targeting Kurdish militants** in Syria, where the
Russian military exerts heavy influence, for years. The US and other
Western countries have collaborated closely with the Kurdish-led Syrian
Democratic Forces in the fight against ISIS. This has increased tensions
between Ankara and the West, and it\'s an issue **at the heart of**
Erdogan\'s repeated **threats to derail Finland and Sweden\'s** NATO
ambitions]{.underline}.  

While in Iran, Erdogan was expected to urge Putin to permit grain
exports from Ukraine in order to alleviate an [escalating global food
crisis](https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-weaponizing-food-to-win-the-war-in-ukraine-experts-2022-7) catalyzed
by Russia\'s blockade on Ukrainian ports. Ukraine, often characterized
as Europe\'s breadbasket, is a major exporter of wheat, sunflower oil,
and corn. 

The EU has decried Russia\'s blockade on Ukrainian food exports as a
\"war crime,\" as experts warn that the Kremlin is deliberately
attempting to provoke famine in poorer countries as part of its broader
strategy to win its unprovoked war in Ukraine. The Kremlin has denied
that it\'s at fault, blaming the situation on Ukraine and Western
sanctions. 

Last week, Istanbul [served as the venue for
talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/turkey-says-deal-reached-ukraine-grain-talks-minister-2022-07-13/) between
Ukrainian and Russian negotiators on grain exports from Ukraine. As they
met in Tehran, Putin thanked Erdogan for his efforts to mediate the
talks. \"With your mediation, we have moved forward,\" [Putin
said](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/07/19/putin-says-progress-in-ukraine-grain-talks-thanks-to-erdogan-kremlin-a78346) to
his Turkish counterpart, the Moscow Times reported. \"Not all issues
have yet been resolved, but the fact that there is movement is already
good.\"

### AT: Ukraine Thumper

#### Turkish voters support Ukraine, but they blame NATO for the war.

**Gaber 6/22**/22, Senior Fellow with Atlantic Council, "Turkey's
wartime bridge to the West is collapsing,"

BradAs

[Obviously, skyrocketing [[anti-American
sentiments]{.mark}](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/anti-us-sentiment-turkey-reaches-new-high-poll-shows) in
Turkey and a traditional mistrust for the West [limit]{.mark} the
possibilities for [cooperation on Ukraine]{.mark}. [Whereas]{.mark} the
[majority of Turks support Ukraine]{.mark} in this war, [[polls show
that]{.mark}](https://www.gazeteduvar.com.tr/anket-sonucu-yuzde-48-savastan-abdnatoyu-sorumlu-tutuyor-galeri-1558582?p=2) more
than [48 percent]{.mark} blame the United States or [NATO for the
conflict]{.mark} while only 34 percent hold Russia
responsible.]{.underline} [There is a [widespread belief in Turkish
society that]{.mark} the war in [Ukraine]{.mark} [is just
anoth]{.mark}er regional [conflict instigated by Western
powers]{.mark}]{.underline} after Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and
others. Russia's invasions and aggression in in South Ossetia, Abkhazia,
Nagorno Karabakh, Transnistria, and more recently in Ukraine and Syria
don't evoke a similar response among Turks.

Populist rhetoric, burgeoning ahead of next year's elections, as well as
massive [anti-Western propaganda on Turkish
media](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-russia-ukraine-war-talk-show-generals-sway-public-against-nato) mostly
featuring retired generals, nationalist pundits, and (pro-)Russian
experts with a strong Eurasianist agenda, do not help either.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's economic and strategic agendas also
depend on close coordination with Moscow. Russia supplies almost half of
Turkish domestic gas demand, provides technology for the country's first
nuclear power plant in Akkuyu, and serves as the source of more than
five million tourists annually. The Kremlin's support is also vital for
Turkey to maintain its presence in the South Caucasus and Middle East.

The recent [meeting of Çavuşoğlu with his Russian counterpart Sergei
Lavrov in
Ankara](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/06/russia-expresses-understanding-turkeys-security-concerns-north-syria) clearly
showed that Turkey is keen to stick to mechanisms for cooperation with
Russia, like the Astana Platform in Syria or the 3+3 format in the South
Caucuses (which also involves Iran, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan).
Instead of using this crisis as a chance to decrease its strategic
dependence on Russia, Turkey seems eager to bind itself even more to
Moscow within new formats.

Money matters

[[Ukraine]{.mark} has so far largely [respected]{.mark} [Turkey's
sensitivities]{.mark} and [not pushed too hard on sanctions]{.mark},
instead focusing on arms supplies and Ankara's mediator role. However,
that dynamic is coming under stress with [Russian oligarchs using Turkey
as a safe
haven](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/04/07/how-turkey-is-courting-russias-oligarchs) to
bypass European Union restrictions]{.underline}. 

[According to Lavrov's recent
statements](https://www.bbc.com/turkce/haberler-dunya-61740947),
Russia-Turkey bilateral trade doubled in the first quarter of 2022, and
there are now ongoing talks on expanding the use of Russia's MIR
payments system in Turkey. In March, [Erdoğan
suggested](https://www.dailysabah.com/business/economy/trade-can-be-conducted-in-ruble-yuan-gold-erdogan-tells-putin?fbclid=IwAR0rkg0EspHvuhnM5FOVzo8wQhJj31V7mXrVbE5jL-pWFDBeUDepfBaZh1k) to
Putin that their countries switch to national currencies or gold in
commercial deals instead of the dollar or euro. Izzet Ekmekcibashi, the
head of the Turkish-Russian Business Council
(DEIK), [said](https://english.nv.ua/business/how-turkey-is-attracting-russian-billions-bypassing-western-sanctions-50236196.html) that
more than one thousand new Russian companies opened in Turkey in March
alone. Most recently, [a well-connected Turkish journalist reported on a
Russian-Turkish
agreement](https://www.haberturk.com/yazarlar/cetiner-cetin/3465136-rus-sirketleri-turkiyeye-tasiniyor) to
move the European headquarters of forty-three leading Russian companies
including Gazprom to Turkey.  

Turkish-Russian cooperation in tourism has also quickly developed.
Turkish media outlets
have [reported](https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-carriers-to-fly-most-russian-tourists-this-season-173977) that
Turkish carriers are operating 438 flights per week to Russia this
summer at a time when sanctions have made it difficult for Moscow to
arrange flights. According to the
pro-government [Sabah newspaper](https://www.sabah.com.tr/ekonomi/rus-turist-getirene-kredi-destegi-5944589),
Turkish Airlines has signed a deal to bring 1.5 million Russian tourists
over in 2022. The newspaper's report suggests that Ankara also plans to
issue loans under state guarantees to support Turkish travel companies
working with Russian tourists and back a new airline with the specific
mandate of transporting Russian tourists to Turkey.

[[Ankara]{.mark}, which earlier [called]{.mark} on [Moscow to end its
blockade of Ukrainian]{.mark} ports so [grain exports]{.mark} could
restart, is now taking a more pro-Russia position, advocating for the
international community to help unblock not only Ukraine's but also
Russia's trade in grain and fertilizers through safe
logistics]{.underline}, ship insurance, and a return of Russian banks to
the SWIFT system. During Lavrov's recent visit to Turkey,
Çavuşoğlu [said](https://thearabweekly.com/own-interests-stake-turkey-backs-russia-grain-deal) that
Turkey considered Moscow's demands "reasonable" and "feasible" and
backed easing Western sanctions against Russia.

### AT: Coop Now

#### Erdogan is causing [headaches]{.underline} for the US---relationships are [low now]{.underline}

**Barnes 7/23** (Julian E. Barnes is a national security reporter for
The New York Times covering the intelligence agencies. "Turkey's Leader
Remains a Headache for Biden Despite Aiding in Ukraine Deal," The New
York Times, 7-23-2022,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/23/us/politics/turkey-nato-ukraine-russia.html>)//sz

When Russia and Ukraine reached an agreement on Friday to [unblock
Ukrainian grain
exports](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/22/world/europe/russia-ukraine-gain-deal.html),
Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, played the role of benevolent
statesman.

Seated next to the United Nations secretary general in an Ottoman palace
in Istanbul, Mr. Erdogan said the deal, which Turkey helped to broker,
would benefit "the whole of humanity."

President Biden's administration welcomed the agreement, which could
relieve a global food crisis intensified by Russia's invasion of Ukraine
and blockade of its ports. Officials expressed skepticism about whether
Russia was acting in good faith, and [Russian missiles struck the
Ukrainian port city of
Odesa](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/07/23/world/ukraine-war-russia) less
than a day after the pact was signed. Still, a White House spokesman had
commended Mr. Erdogan for his efforts.

[But privately, Mr. [**Erdogan** has remained a source of
**substantial** irritation for **Biden administration
officials.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Days before presiding over the grain agreement, [the [Turkish autocrat
**renewed a warning that he might veto NATO's plans to accept Sweden and
Finland as members in the coming months**]{.mark}, an act that would
**[deeply embarrass the alliance]{.mark} and [the Biden
administration]{.mark}** [as they work to counter
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} And [[[Congress]{.mark} this month
**e[xpressed
misgivings]{.mark}**](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/13/us-fighter-jets-sale-dems-00045731) about
Mr. [Biden']{.mark}s pledge at a NATO summit in Spain last month to
[sell]{.mark} dozens of [F-16 fighter jets to
Turkey]{.mark}.]{.underline}

On Tuesday, Mr**[. [Erdogan traveled to Tehran for meetings]{.mark} with
[Iran]{.mark}'s [pres]{.mark}ident, Ebrahim [Raisi, and]{.mark} Russia's
president, Vladimir V. [Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The [images of
[two prime American rivals]{.mark} with Mr. [Erdogan]{.mark}, the leader
of a NATO country[, **clashed**]{.mark} **with the [Western
narrative]{.mark} of a [deeply isolated Iran and Russia]{.mark}**,
analysts said.]{.underline}

Then on Friday, a [[White House spokesman **reiterated U.S.
concerns**]{.underline}]{.mark} about Mr. [[Erdogan's threat]{.mark}s to
mount a new [invasion of northern Syria targeting **U.S.-backed Kurdish
fighters**]{.mark} whom he considers terrorists.]{.underline}

Taken together, Mr. Erdogan's actions --- and Mr. Biden's limited
ability to restrain them --- underscore the Turkish leader's unique
position as a military ally frequently at odds with the agenda of his
Western allies. To [[U.S. officials, it is an often maddening
role.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[**"Erdogan** is]{.mark} basically [the **Joe Manchin of
NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Elizabeth Shackelford, a former
Foreign Service officer, referring to the conservative Democratic
senator from West Virginia who has stymied Mr. Biden's domestic agenda.
"He's on our team, but then [[he does things that are so clearly not
good for our team. **And I just don't see that
changing."**]{.underline}]{.mark}

A senior U.S. official said that much of Mr. Erdogan's problematic
behavior was a function of his political weakness in Turkey, where the
inflation rate [climbed to almost 80
percent](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/04/economy/turkey-inflation-food-energy/index.html) last
month. Hoping to shift attention from his mismanaged economy, Mr.
Erdogan has turned to chest-thumping displays of nationalism and
demagogy over the threat from the P.K.K., a Kurdish separatist movement
in Turkey, and Kurdish groups in Syria.

Major NATO initiatives, like the proposed expansion of the 30-member
alliance to include Sweden and Finland, require unanimous consent. Mr[.
Biden]{.underline} said in May that [he hoped the two countries could
"quickly" join in what would be a major strategic blow to Mr.
Putin.]{.underline}

But [Mr. [Erdogan raised objections]{.mark}]{.underline}, complaining
that both potential new members have lent political and financial
support to the P.K.K., which the United States has designated as a
terrorist organization because of its history of violent attacks[. U.S.
and NATO officials worried that the [planned expansion]{.mark} could
[collapse in a **major propaganda win for Mr. Putin**]{.mark}, who has
long worked to divide the alliance.]{.underline}

The [two-page
agreement](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2022/6/pdf/220628-trilat-memo.pdf) said
in generalized language that Sweden and Finland would address Turkey's
"pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects
expeditiously and thoroughly." But Turkish officials have said they
expect the extradition of more than 70 individuals. It was unclear
whether Sweden and Finland would agree or how Mr. Erdogan might react if
they did not.

[[On Monday, Mr. Erdogan **warned that he could still ["freeze" NATO's
expansion](https://apnews.com/article/nato-middle-east-turkey-sweden-6fa686d2db9e228e7d0f28e4e3814a78)**]{.mark}** **]{.underline}if
his demands were not met.

Mr. Biden also told Mr. Erdogan in Spain that he supported the sale of
40 American F-16 fighter jets that Turkey requested last fall, along
with technology upgrades for dozens of fighters it already owns.
Turkey wants those planes in part because the [Trump administration
canceled
plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/world/europe/us-turkey-russia-missiles.html) to
sell the country advanced F-35 fighter jets in 2019 after Mr.
[[Erdogan]{.mark}, in one of his more confounding recent moves[,
purchased Russia's S-400 antiaircraft missile **system in defiance of
U.S. warnings.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Representative Chris Pappas, Democrat of New Hampshire and the
amendment's sponsor, also cited [Mr. Erdogan's purchase of the Russian
missile system and equivocal position toward Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. Mr. [Erdogan]{.mark} has called the invasion "unacceptable" but
**[has not joined sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies
on Russia.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Once the White House formally requests that Congress approve the sale of
the planes, Mr. Biden will need the support of other influential members
who have been highly critical of Mr. Erdogan, including the Democratic
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Menendez of New
Jersey.

Mr. Menendez has previously questioned whether Turkey  belongs in NATO
at all. And at a hearing last month on the proposed NATO expansion, he
said that "[with time of the essence, the 11th-hour concerns by Turkey
standing in the way of this process only serve Putin's
interests."]{.underline}

Mr. Menendez also [issued a
statement](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/ranking/release/risch-menendez-meeks-mccaul-statement-on-threatened-turkish-incursion-into-northern-syria) last
month with his Republican counterpart on the Foreign Relations
Committee, Senator Jim Risch of Idaho[[, sternly warning Mr. Erdogan
against his threatened invasion of northern Syria.]{.underline}]{.mark}
They were joined by the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, Representative Gregory W. Meeks of New York, and his
Republican counterpart, Representative Michael McCaul of Texas.

In the statement, the lawmakers said the potential invasion would have
"disastrous results," threatening local operations against the remnants
of the Islamic State and exacerbating Syria's humanitarian crisis.

A Pentagon official recently added to the American warnings.

"[[We **strongly oppose** any Turkish operation]{.mark} into northern
Syria and have [made clear our objections
to **Turkey**,"]{.mark}]{.underline} Dana Stroul, a deputy assistant
secretary of defense, said this month at the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy. "ISIS is going to take advantage of that campaign."

Some of Mr. Erdogan's harshest critics warn of an endless cycle, in
which the Turkish leader wins concessions from the United States and
other NATO allies, such as new fighter jets and a tougher line against
Kurdish militia fighters, only to escalate his demands in the future.

"This dance around the F-16 --- it's jet fighter diplomacy, and that is
a mask of what's truly at play here," said Mark Wallace, founder of the
Turkish Democracy Project, a group highly critical of Mr. Erdogan and
his turn to authoritarianism. **["[A good ally --- much less a good NATO
ally --- doesn't use blackmail to get what it wants at key moments in
the alliance's history."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### **Turkey builds alliances and goes to war**

University. (Baba, Gürol and Önsoy, Murat, "Between Capability and
Foreign Policy: Comparing Turkey's Small Power and Middle Power Status",
*Uluslararası İlişkiler*, Volume 13, No. 51, 2016, pp. 9-20.) //RSG🌳

[After the Second World War, Turkey significantly advanced
its]{.underline} tangible (as seen in Tables 1-3) and intangible
capabilities. During this period Turkey's modus operandi was clearly
different from the 1930s. Two definitive examples of Turkey's [middle
power]{.underline} attitude have been selected for elaboration. These
are the Cyprus issue and the March 2003 memorandum. In the first
example, Turkey objected to the Greek Cypriot threats to the status quo
on the island after the British withdrawal in 1960. [[Turkey believed
its legal rights to be acknowledged]{.underline}]{.mark} by the Treaty
of Guarantee [[and]{.mark} unilaterally **[intervened to rebuild the
status quo disrupted by the Greek]{.mark}**]{.underline} Cypriots
throughout the 1960s and early 1970s.69 In the second example,
[[Turkey]{.mark}'s rejection of]{.underline} the March 2003 memorandum
[granting American troop's access to Iraq]{.underline} through Turkish
territory was another significant pro-status quo move.70 In both cases,
Turkey [[acted to influence the final outcome of an issue]{.mark}, in
the process [endangering its position with]{.mark}in a Western
[alliance. It]{.mark} was motivated by regional stability but **did not
avoid conflict**[, asserting its position]{.mark} as an autonomous
middle power]{.underline}.71 Turkey, as a middle power, also believed in
using multilateral schemes to deal with international issues. On the
Cyprus Question, particularly during the 1960s, Turkey consistently
brought the issue to the guarantor powers72 for consultation, and to the
US as well. Yet [in the post-Cold War era, [it]{.mark}]{.underline} no
longer expected help from multilateral schemes, [aiming instead to use
them to [improve its international]{.mark} position. A clear example is
Turkey's [role in peacekeeping]{.mark}, observer missions [and police
operations in the Balkans]{.mark},]{.underline} [Caucasus, [and Middle
East]{.mark} including Afghanistan]{.underline},73 and particularly in
the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFL).74 In all these operations and
missions [Turkey strived to increase its individual significance and
esteem. As a clear example, Turkey [employed the OIC]{.mark} [to
increase its foreign policy]{.mark} outreach and amplify its
voice.]{.underline} Turkey, with the new millennium, began to take more
direct roles via creating multilateral schemes in its neighboring
regions. [The Caucasus Peace and Stability Pact proposal in
2000]{.underline} -- covering Turkey, Armenia, Georgia, Russia and
Azerbaijan, and relying on the 1997 Balkan Stability Pact's main
principles -- is a clear example.75 [Turkey attempted to strengthen the
common interests of the Pact's prospective members in order to [foster
cooperation for security and development]{.mark}, as well as to
cultivate regional and multilateral cooperation projects.]{.underline}
Turkey worked with local middle powers to construct bridging alignments.
In the mid1950s, [Turkey's efforts to [create a defense pact]{.mark} --
as a "requirement" of its leading role in the implementation of Northern
Tier strategy [with Iraq, Iran and Pakistan]{.mark}]{.underline} -- is
one example. The efforts were initiated as the Baghdad Pact in 1955 and
died as the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) in 1979.76 Although
CENTO did not really deliver what it originally aimed to do, [it
provided a foundation for Turkey to build a bridge between its members
and NATO.]{.underline}77 In 1985 [Turkey, along with Iran and Pakistan,
founded the Economic Cooperation Organization, which was later
expanded]{.underline} to include Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Ankara aimed to
create a synergy to provide [sustainable development]{.underline} by
making full use of available resources in the region.78 In 1992,
[[Turkey was the key actor in the formation]{.mark} and the
implementation [of the Black Sea]{.mark} Economic Cooperation
[Scheme]{.mark} for regional economic cooperation and
development.]{.underline}79 The Scheme's integration [[model]{.mark} was
looser and more flexible than that of the EU]{.underline}, which [would
open up "a formerly closed or semiclosed [market of more than 350
million people]{.mark}" to Turkey]{.underline}.80 All these efforts
exemplify Turkey's go-between attitude towards international economic
coalition building. Turkey was also a go-between for political/security
disputes, although not very successfully. [It aimed to play a major role
in the dialogue between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh
dispute]{.underline}. The [political constraints exerted by the
West]{.underline} -- i.e. Turkey's reliance upon US military aid to
fight the PKK in the 1990s, its need to de-escalate the situation with
the EU and its priority of maintaining good relations with Moscow
regarding private business interests in Russia -- [constrained Turkey
from involving itself too deeply in Karabakh]{.underline}.81 [Turkey was
also one of the founding members of the non-Proliferation and
Disarmament Initiative in 2010,82 where [it]{.mark} **[came
together]{.mark}** with similar-sized and like-minded states **[to
advance the nuclear disarmament agenda]{.mark}**, as well as greater
transparency in the fulfilment of disarmament commitments among nuclear
states.]{.underline} How helpful that initiative will be remains to be
seen. [These examples show the]{.underline} complementarity between
[capabilities and the foreign policy]{.underline} limits [of middle
powers.]{.underline} In the economic domain, [middle powers have more
maneuvering space to take the initiative on
collaboration/cooperation.]{.underline} In the political and security
domains, they are still restricted by alliance networks and the
perceptions and interests of great powers. Therefore, [the
less]{.underline} their foreign policies [conflict]{.underline} with
those of the great powers, [the more effective the middle state can be
-- or, in other words, the less ambitious, the more
successful.]{.underline} In early 2007, [[Turkey's sincere efforts to
prevent Iraq from descending into chaos]{.mark}, and from being divided
into Shia and Sunni groups,83 [is an example of]{.mark} good
international citizenship and [its]{.mark} pursuit of stability and
balance.]{.underline} Another recent example of this is the MIKTA
collaboration, an acronym for [Mexico, Indonesia, Korea, Turkey and
Australia,]{.underline} established in 2013. The five members' [major
[aim]{.mark} has been [to]{.mark} amplify their voice on various
platforms, especially the G20,]{.underline} with the particular aim of
achieving regional and global peace and stability.84 This also shows
that [good international citizenship by middle powers is better
[receive]{.mark}d and results in [greater leverage]{.mark} than
adventurist political moves that cause conflict with great
powers.]{.underline} Conclusion The ambiguity in IR literature between
small powers and middle powers has been the terminus a quo of this
article. By focusing on ambiguities in definition and differentiation,
the article offers an amalgamated methodology of combining capabilities
with foreign policy behavior. This combination assumes not only that
there is a relationship, but also a complementarity between capabilities
and foreign policy. [The [rise in national capabilities]{.mark} not only
[lifts a country's status but also opens up foreign policy]{.mark}
maneuverability.]{.underline} Yet this is not so straightforward. Since
national capabilities have intangible elements, i.e. [how various
countries perceive and value the capabilities of other nation-states,
this complementarity may have unexpected results]{.underline}. A small
power could be seen as a very valuable asset, which amplifies its own
foreign policy outreach, while a middle power might not be able to
achieve a seemingly basic objective due to restrictions imposed by great
powers. [Turkey's experience since the 1930s exemplifies]{.underline}
both straightforward and non-straightforward cases. In the 1930s, Turkey
[counterbalanced its vulnerabilities with resilience and constantly
recalibrated its self-image]{.underline}, and in doing so, Ankara
reconciled multiple identities depending on the major power it was
tilting towards. A [[Russia-friendly foreign policy went hand-in-hand
with an anti-Communist domestic policy]{.mark}; similarly, a
non-pro-Western foreign policy was not an obstacle to a close
partnership with Britain]{.underline}, and an anti-fascist stance did
not hinder an economic partnership with Germany and Italy. Turkey's
foreign policy "pivots" show that [[**a resilient small power is able to
manage the strategic calculations of great
powers**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Its national capabilities determine its
status and its foreign policy outreach, but intangible elements in its
capabilities could complement resilient foreign policy objectives. Since
the end of the Second World War, [[Turkey]{.mark} has increased its
tangible national capabilities drastically. This has not only
[**elevated its status internationally** but has]{.mark} also given it
[a much larger arena in which to conduct foreign
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet this has not removed all of its
constraints, particularly in the security and political spheres. Turkey
is still limited by great powers. Therefore even boosted national
capabilities do not always complement the ability of middle powers to
attain political and securityrelated objectives, especially if they
skirmish with great powers.

#### Turkey can use US nukes 

**QRIUS, 2019,** Does the US Have Nuclear Weapons in Turkey?,

As the Syrian crisis pits Turkish troops against former U.S.-allied
Kurdish forces, Pentagon officials have been reviewing plans to [remove
50 nuclear bombs stored at a U.S air base in
Turkey](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/world/middleeast/trump-turkey-syria.html).

A congressional directive to the Pentagon to quickly assess alternative
homes for U.S. "[personnel and
assets](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/10/congress-calls-us-scout-nuclear-alternatives-turkey-base.html)"
currently stationed at Incirlik Air Base is part of a broader bipartisan
bill, still being debated, that proposes sanctions against Turkey.
President Donald Trump has been forced to issue [public reassurances
that the weapons are
secure](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/10/18/us/politics/ap-us-united-states-turkey-nukes.html).

[[During]{.mark} the [Cold War]{.mark}, the [U.S]{.mark}.
[stationed]{.mark} [B-61 [nuclear
bombs]{.mark}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B61_nuclear_bomb) [in
Turkey,]{.mark} among other NATO countries. [Formally]{.mark}, the [U.S.
controlled]{.mark} the [weapons during peacetime]{.mark}, [but]{.mark}
the [host countries]{.mark}' [forces [trained]{.mark} and equipped
planes](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL32572.pdf) [so [they could drop
the
bombs](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/18/americas-nukes-arent-safe-in-turkey-anymore/)]{.mark} with
U.S. support [in the case of war]{.mark}]{.underline}. The idea was to
deter Soviet ground forces and reassure U.S. allies by making clear that
the U.S. would be willing to risk nuclear war to block a Soviet invasion
of a country hosting the bombs.

In addition, in the years before the U.S. developed intercontinental
ballistic missiles, they presented a way for NATO to demonstrate it
could act quickly to respond to a Soviet attack.

[[The]{.mark} 50 [bombs]{.mark} still at Incirlik Air Base, [in]{.mark}
southern [Turkey]{.mark} -- and others in [Belgium, Germany, Italy and
the
Netherlands](https://newrepublic.com/article/155381/us-nuclear-bombs-still-turkey) --
[are the last]{.mark} [nuclear]{.mark} [remnants]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
that [[Cold Wa]{.mark}r
strategy](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/cuban-missile-crisis)]{.underline}.
The U.S. began [pulling nuclear bombs out of NATO
countries](https://fas.org/_docs/Non_Strategic_Nuclear_Weapons.pdf) after
the Cold War ended, and since 2000 has [removed 40 bombs from
Turkey](https://fas.org/blogs/security/2019/10/nukes-out-of-turkey/).

Two decades ago, the [Turkish Air Force stopped equipping its
planes](https://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/05-06/larsen.pdf) to drop
B-61s. Now the bombs at Incirlik could only be used if [U.S. pilots
first flew nuclear-weapon-capable planes
there](https://fas.org/blogs/security/2019/10/nukes-out-of-turkey/) to
load them up. [The [bombs were left in Turkey]{.mark} [even
after]{.mark} a [[2016 coup
attempt]{.mark}](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36815476) [raised]{.mark}
serious [concerns about]{.mark} their [safety.]{.mark}]{.underline}
After that event, the U.S. Defense and Energy departments
began [planning how to remove
them](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/20/world/middleeast/erdogan-turkey-nuclear-weapons-trump.html) --
but didn't actually bring them back to the U.S.

How secure are they?

U.S. nuclear weapons are stored in hardened bunkers, protected by
electronic systems and [heavily armed U.S.
troops](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/4873/leaving-nuclear-weapons-in-turkey-is-just-poor-strategy).
The Pentagon has [recently
reinforced](https://fas.org/blogs/security/2019/10/nukes-out-of-turkey/) both
of those methods of defense.

The bombs themselves also require 12-digit codes to activate them,
[However, those [protections are [only strong enough to delay
unauthorized
use](https://twitter.com/b_radzinsky/status/1186654541917413376), rather
than]{.mark} actually [prevent it.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}If
those barriers were overcome[,]{.mark} U.S forces could disable the
weapons by destroying electrical components or detonating their chemical
high explosive without causing a nuclear release. In the worst case,
they could blow up the weapons or the facilities at Incirlik.

[Still the U[.]{.mark}S[. procedures]{.mark} [are not designed to
prevent]{.mark} skilled [attacks or sabotage]{.mark}, [especially from
an ally]{.mark}. With enough time, [Turkey could make use of]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear material -- if not [to]{.mark}
[detonate]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n actual [nuclear
explosion]{.mark}]{.underline}, then to "[release disastrous and deadly
radiation](https://newrepublic.com/article/155381/us-nuclear-bombs-still-turkey7)."

What's wrong with removing them?

[[Taking]{.mark} the [weapons out]{.mark} [of Turkey carries]{.mark}
some physical [risks]{.mark}]{.underline}. The bombs aren't terribly
heavy -- [roughly 700
pounds](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/19263/get-to-know-americas-long-serving-b61-family-of-nuclear-bombs) each
-- [but moving nuclear material [requires]{.mark} significant
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, the Turkish government
would have to help -- or at least not stand in the way -- of [landing
transport planes or sending cargo convoys by land or
sea](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/30417/u-s-reviewing-options-for-pulling-nuclear-bombs-out-of-turkey-heres-how-they-might-do-it).

The greater risks are likely to be political. Those concerns have
discouraged previous U.S. administrations from removing the bombs, even
though [Turkey's defense community isn't particularly interested in
using
them](http://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ensuring-Deterrence-against-Russia.pdf).

[One U.S. concern is that [Turkey could perceive]{.mark} the [move as a
push away]{.mark} [from]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark}. That [could lead
to]{.mark} [Turkey]{.mark} [seeking]{.mark} closer [ties with
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In addition, pulling the nuclear weapons out of Turkey could prompt
requests to remove other bombs from Belgium, the Netherlands and
Germany, where they are [publicly
unpopular](https://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/polls-public-opinion-in-eu-host-states-firmly-opposes-nuclear-weapons).

[A new worry just arose, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip
[Erdogan]{.mark} recently [mused whether]{.mark} [perhaps [Turkey should
leav]{.mark}e [the]{.mark} Nuclear [Non-Prolif]{.mark}eration
[Treaty]{.mark}](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/20/world/middleeast/erdogan-turkey-nuclear-weapons-trump.html) [and
develop its own]{.mark} [nuclear arsenal]{.mark}. U.S. officials have
long feared that pulling the American nuclear bombs out could encourage
Ergodan to try to [turn that bluster into
reality](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/some-worries-about-nuclear-weapons-at-turkey-base/2019/10/19/88f8ca0e-f231-11e9-bb7e-d2026ee0c199_story.html)]{.underline}.

Unintentionally, Trump's efforts to provide reassurance may have made
this challenge more difficult. The presence of B-61s in the five
countries [is an open
secret](https://www.apnews.com/182a2170a1d24ac6b4f0c7242d8ff514),
confirmed by independent observers. But it has nonetheless been NATO
policy not to acknowledge the deployments, giving local politicians and
the U.S. a shield from parliamentary and public oversight.

By publicly confirming that the weapons were in Turkey, Trump has raised
the political stakes should he try to remove them, and made it more
difficult for the United States and Turkey to strike a quiet deal to
that effect.

#### **Turkey is on the road to being a global power**

**Baba and Onsoy 16** -- Assist. Prof. Dr., Department of International
Relations, Social Science University of Ankara & King's College London,
Assist. Prof. Dr., Department of International Relations, Hacettepe
University. (Baba, Gürol and Önsoy, Murat, "Between Capability and
Foreign Policy: Comparing Turkey's Small Power and Middle Power Status",
*Uluslararası İlişkiler*, Volume 13, No. 51, 2016, pp. 9-20.) //RSG🌳

[**[Turkey has boosted its international position]{.mark}** since the
1930s.]{.underline} This process hides two major aspects of the small
power and middle power comparison: a clear increase in capabilities
(GNP, population, military expenditure, number/content/focus of
international agreements), and related examples of foreign policy
behavior. Turkey's boost illustrates to what extent and under which
circumstances the increase in capabilities complements foreign policy
objectives. The increase in Turkey's tangible capabilities can be seen
in Tables below: \[table omitted\] One indicator of Turkey's boost can
be seen in its international agreements. During the 1930s, Turkey's
international agreements related to friendship, neutrality, mutual
security, cooperation, maintaining a good neighborhood and joining
sanctions regimes. [With the end of the Second World War,]{.underline}
the [agreements increased in]{.underline} their [number and diversity.
This illustrates Turkey's success in engaging in international
politics.]{.underline} In this period, several [bilateral and
multilateral agreements/ conventions were concluded with neighboring and
non-neighboring countries within the framework of the UN
and]{.underline} its [subordinate organizations]{.underline}, as well as
the OECD, [the EU, NATO]{.underline}, Council of Europe, the OSCE,
Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), etc.47 Turkey's capabilities
and attitudes towards foreign policy during the 1930s fall into the
small power category. The small powers of the 1930s faced a "dangerous
combination of an increasing war threat ... the emergence of new and
costly military technology, and overall offensive military doctrines".48
Within this dangerous combination of circumstances, [[Ankara]{.mark}
successfully [balanced]{.mark} its [vulnerabilities with
resilience]{.mark}, which made Turkey a]{.underline} non-negligible
element in the strategic calculations of [great power]{.underline}s.
Turkey's relations with great powers clearly illustrate this point.
[Through its [relations with Germany]{.mark}, Ankara managed to
[counterbalance threat perceptions with economic
opportunities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Turkey increased its trade volume
with Germany until the German threat outweighed the economic benefits.
With the "clearing" agreement in 1933,49 Germany became a major exporter
of manufactured goods and an importer of raw materials and agricultural
products from Turkey.50 Until 1936, this relationship served as a
panacea for Turkey's decreasing export incomes.51 By 1936, Germany made
up half of Turkey's imports and exports, and as Hitler intensified war
preparations, Ankara moved to reduce the German influence on the economy
by diversifying its trading partners.52 For example, Turkey made an
accord with the British construction company Brassert for the
construction of the first steel factory in Karabük even though the
German company Krupps had offered a better deal.53 [Turkey's pivot
towards Britain exemplified a "defensive life". This also changed
Britain's outlook towards Turkey,]{.underline} which involved no
commitment until 1936. Britain first supported Turkey's claims as the
basis of discussions in Montreux. A clearing agreement was signed in
September 1936 to increase the trade volume, which distanced Turkey from
Germany.54 The shift increased the value of Turkish imports from Great
Britain from 6 to 7 million Turkish Lira (TL) and exports from 6 to 9.7
million TL. Meanwhile the German share in Turkish trade decreased in
value for the first time from 60,042,000 TL (51%) to 50,412,000 TL
(36.5%).55 Turkey's move to keep its alliances mixed highlights the
focus on resilience. Although its relations with Britain deepened in
1938, Turkey did not completely detach from Germany. TurkeyBritain trade
did not reach the volume of that with Germany, from which it also
received 150 million Reichsmarks (RM) of credit.56 The decision to
specialize in certain products is another indicator. [[Turkey,]{.mark}
as the second largest producer of chrome ore in the world, [became a
major supplier of]{.mark}]{.underline} German
[[industry]{.underline}]{.mark}.57 The chrome trade with Germany rose
from a value of 35 thousand RM to 3.5 million RM from 1929 to 1939,
which covered almost 60% of Germany's total demand.58 Chrome sales
contributed to Turkey's budget substantially, and gradually made Germany
dependent on Turkey's supply of chrome.

#### Greece nukes

**Efstathiou & Kappis  21 ** (Poltical office at the EU delegation to
the united Arab emirates & Deputy director and lecturer at the centre
for suite and intelligence studies in
BUCSIS <https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/weapons-mass-debate-greece-key-security-player-both-europe-and-nato>
"Weapons of Mass Debate - Greece: a Key Security Player for both Europe
and NATO") //ca

[During the Cold War and until 2001, [Greece hosted US nuclear
weapons]{.mark} on its territory, [as part of]{.mark} a [NATO
nuclear-sharing agreement]{.mark}. Yet, recent geopolitical
developments - the US's progressive military [disengagement from the
Middle East]{.mark}, its \"[pivot to Asia]{.mark}\", [debate
around]{.mark} removing nuclear weapons from [Turkey]{.mark} -
[highlight]{.mark} **[Greece's potential to become]{.mark} a
[nuclear]{.mark} base [again]{.mark}**. [Greece is sold to]{.mark} the
[idea of]{.mark} greater European strategic [autonomy]{.mark} and is not
suspicious of France, unlike other member states.]{.underline} However,
Athen's lack of reaction following French President Emmanuel Macron's
February 2020 speech is due to the country's other internal priorities
and its commitment to NATO as the only actor capable of offering nuclear
deterrence at the moment. In this fifth episode of our series Weapons of
Mass Debate, Yvonni Efstathiou, Programme Coordinator and Research
Analyst for Defense and Military Analysis at IISS, and Bill Kappis,
Lecturer at the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies in the
University of Buckingham, analyze Greece's position on the future of
European security. There is hardly any evidence of a debate concerning
nuclear weapons within the Greek military and political apparatus,
mainly due to concerns regarding the sensitivity of the issue in
international affairs, but also due to the political cost associated
with the topic. Despite the fact that from 1978 to 2001, the Hellenic
Airforce Araxos Air Base hosted the NATO 345 Air Munitions Company under
the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements, the Greeks are sceptical about
nuclear deployments, with most critics, unsurprisingly, hailing from the
left of the political spectrum. [In any case, the fact remains that
**[Greece has]{.mark}** been one of just seven nations to have
[**hosted** US **nuclear bombs**]{.mark} on their territory, as part of
NATO nuclear-sharing agreements.]{.underline} Yet, the country's
decision not to retain its nuclear strike capability by scrapping its
A-7E warplanes, meant that Athens curtailed its capacity to participate
in the US nuclear deployment programme[.]{.underline} This reportedly
resulted in the withdrawal of 20 US thermonuclear gravity bombs (B61) in
2001, following years of discussions around the subject. Nevertheless,
Greece continues to support the Alliance's nuclear deterrence doctrine,
as indicated by the country's endorsement of relevant Alliance
statements. [[Recent]{.mark} geopolitical [developments]{.mark}
[suggest]{.mark} there should be a [renewed **interest in**]{.mark}
**[bolstering]{.mark}** **conventional and [nuclear]{.mark}
[deterrence]{.mark} [within NATO]{.mark}** and, more specifically,
within the European operational theatre.]{.underline} The reduction of
US troop numbers in the continent has continued unabated since the first
steps of American disengagement from Europe and the Middle East, during
the Obama administration. The so-called US \"pivot to Asia,\" meanwhile,
suggests that future American deployments will be aimed at bolstering
power projection in the Asia-Pacific, bearing an adverse impact on the
only superpower's capacity to face concurrent security crises across the
globe. This major geopolitical shift will undoubtedly \"test\" the
credibility of American deterrence in Europe. Extended deterrence
(preventing an armed attack against another allied state or group of
states) is, in theory, much more demanding to maintain in a credible
manner, as the deterrer should, in principle, be perceived as both
capable and willing to deliver an appropriate response to the perceived
challenger. Providing a robust extended deterrence umbrella to both
European and Asia-Pacific allies is conceivable for the US, but far from
straightforward, even for the sole superpower. [The need for a renewed
debate becomes all the more important as the demise of the INF treaty
could further weaken Europe's nuclear deterrence, as the INF was heavily
geared towards intra-European strategic stability. The [advent]{.mark},
moreover, [of hypersonic missiles]{.mark} and their potential
introduction [into]{.mark} the European [nuclear]{.mark} strategic
[landscape]{.mark} [opens the door to additional pressures]{.mark} on
the perceived credibility of the continent's nuclear deterrence.
Finally, the Russian and Iranian nuclear programmes, as well as the
[nuclear aspirations of]{.mark} other regional powers in Europe's
vicinity, (i.e. [Turkey]{.mark}) should [mobilize]{.mark} Europe and
thereby **[Greece to]{.mark} revisit and [reflect]{.mark} upon this
policy domain.** Taking into consideration **Greece's desire for a
strategically autonomous Europe**,]{.underline} Athens should be, at
least in theory, in favour of a renewed debate around nuclear weapons
both as part of NATO burden-sharing arrangements and as a proponent of
French deterrent capabilities within the EU.

### AT: Diversionary War False

#### Diversionary War Theory, specifically between Turkey and Greece, is true -- studies and calculations prove.

from Turkish Airspace Incursions," Foreign Policy Analysis, Volume 17,
Issue 3, July 2021, orab007, <https://doi.org/10.1093/fpa/orab007>,

We present our empirical results in table 2. Model 1 includes only
Approvalm−1, the independent variable of main theoretical interest, and
term-fixed effects in addition to the AR(1) and May terms, while model 2
adds the [dummy variables indicating pre-election months and the gas
dispute. Model 3 then adds the variable measuring Turkish citizens'
perceptions of the economy, while model 4 instead includes GDP per
capita as well as Greek and Turkish defense spending]{.underline}.
[Econ. perceptionsm]{.underline}−1 is only available from 2015 onward,
leading to reduced temporal coverage of the time series and hence our
sample size. We thus omit this variable from the most complete
specification, model 4. The results in models 1--4 are in line with our
hypothesis as Approvalm−1 exhibits a coefficient that is consistently
negative and statistically distinguishable from zero at the 99 percent
level. [Since the dependent variable in these models is the transformed
number of airspace violations while the unit of Approvalm−1 is percent,
we can interpret its coefficient as the percent change in airspace
incursions for a 1 percent increase in approval]{.underline}. Based on
model 4, **[a 1 percent increase in public approval for Recep Tayyip
Erdogan leads to a 0.0319 percent decrease in airspace ˘
violations]{.underline}**. In contrast[, the control variables do not
assert a statically significant effect on airspace
incursions]{.underline}. [To examine the substantive effect of approval
ratings on airspace violations in more detail, we present a plot of the
predicted number of Turkish incursions into Greek-claimed airspace over
the range of observed approval values]{.underline} in figure 2. [The
figure underlines that approval rate has a substantive, if moderate,
effect on airspace violations as it shows that model 4 predicts 141 such
incursions if Erdogan's approval was 37.5 percent in the previous month,
whereas ˘ this number decreases to almost 100 if 50 percent of
respondents approved of his leadership]{.underline}. Next, we test the
robustness of our results to several alternative specifications. Most
importantly, we follow earlier studies (e.g., DeRouen and Peake 2002;
Pickering and Kisangani 2010) by using VAR to model the effect of
approval ratings on airspace violations and vice versa as an endogenous
relationship. This allows us to examine whether approval drives airspace
violations and/or the other way around. For identification purposes, it
is necessary to restrict the contemporaneous effect of one of the
endogenous variables to zero (Enders 2015). Approval data take time to
collect with the Metropoll survey data only being collected toward the
end Downloaded from

month, meaning that they only become available after some time has
passed. In contrast, reporting on airspace violations is more imminent
as they are mentioned in the news and on social media. [We thus allow
airspace violations to have a contemporaneous effect on approval
ratings, while only past approval values can affect airspace
violations]{.underline}.7 Following standard practice, we present
impulse response function plots in figure 3, showing how one endogenous
variable is affected by a shock in the other endogenous variable, as
well as results from Granger causality tests to interpret the VAR
results instead of relying on regression coefficients. In line with our
expectations, figure 3 indicates that positive shocks to approval
ratings result in less airspace violations. In contrast, positive shocks
to the number of airspace incursions are found to have no statistically
significant effect on leader approval. Accordingly, Granger causality
tests suggest that approval ratings drive airspace violations but not
the other way around. These results provide additional support to our
expectation that low approval ratings lead to diversionary action.
However, they also raise the question why this is the case if such
diversionary acts do not result in higher approval. One possible answer
is that these diversionary actions do not target a wider domestic
audience but instead key players within the governmental coalition
(Morgan and Bickers 1992; Nicholls, Huth, and Appel 2010). **[Turkish
territorial incursions may thus be designed to garner support from
ultranationalist elements within the AKP and MHP by showing that the
government is not afraid to confront Greece over the contested
territory, even if such a policy may not find support, and hence boost
approval, among more centrist or opposition voters.]{.underline}** [We
present further specifications examining the robustness of our results
in the online appendix, but the result that lower approval ratings
increase airspace incursions persists]{.underline}. Conclusion
Diversionary foreign policies have been the topic of a large literature
that, however, reports mixed findings on whether domestic problems
result in interstate conflict. 7 The VAR models include the control
variables from model 4 and, based on information criteria, a lag order
of 1. This paper adds to this debate by arguing that while leaders may
be hesitant to start an outright war to boost their approval, [they will
pursue smaller scale aggressive actions within existing disputes to gain
domestic support.]{.underline} [Results from tests using monthly data on
leader approval and airspace violations in the territorial dispute
between Greece and Turkey offer support for this argument]{.underline}:
**[low approval ratings for Turkey's leader result in more Turkish
incursions into contested airspace.]{.underline}** This result most
directly contributes to the literature on diversionary conflict. First,
we introduce Turkey as a new case for quantitatively testing the theory,
whereas most applications focus on the United States. Second, we add to
a nascent literature studying diversionary acts below the crisis or
militarized dispute level. [Third and most importantly, we show that
when facing domestic disapproval, leaders resort to material acts of
aggressive foreign policy that are less costly than a new conflict but
also more than cheap talk to increase support]{.underline}. **[This is
an important result as such aggressive acts, the intensification of an
existing territorial dispute in the case of Turkey, can lead to actual
armed conflict further down the line]{.underline}**. Our research thus
also provides insights into the escalatory processes leading up to armed
confrontations between neighbors such as those on the Indian--Chinese
border in early summer 2020. This study suggests several avenues of
further research. First, future research should investigate whether
territorial incursions or provocations are used in a similar,
diversionary manner in cases other than Turkey. Second, they should
examine whether domestic problems generally give rise to aggressive
foreign policy behaviors below armed conflict or whether this requires
the previous existence of a dispute whose salience leaders can tap into.
Third, our research produced the surprising finding that airspace
incursions do not actually succeed in boosting support from the Turkish
public. As such, future research should further examine to what extent
such diversionary policies target the general public or more specific,
strategically important audiences such as coalition partners

### AT: No War

#### Erdogan [will]{.underline} start a diversionary war

war: Turkey's actions against Greece are a growing threat to NATO,\"

Turkish obstructionism against Swedish and Finnish NATO membership, its
limited offensive in Iraq, and its prospective offensive in Syria have
grabbed international attention. But more significant is [[Turkey's
growing diplomatic tension with Greece]{.underline}]{.mark}, an
ever-festering lesion that threatens to burst. [Considering Turkey's
domestic situation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United States
must be wary. Turkish President Recip Tayyip [**Erdogan could capitalize
on international distraction** and wage a diversionary war to boost his
popularity]{.mark}]{.underline}, a [conflict that would [disrupt NATO's
cohesion and **threaten the alliance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Washington
should act now to resolve the current incarnation of this long-standing
Mediterranean dispute. Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dominated Turkish
politics since 2001, when his AKP party first won a two-thirds
parliamentary majority. Although Erdogan was banned from Turkish
politics for anti-secular incitement, his prime ministerial --- and,
later, presidential --- predecessor, Abdullah Gül, until the mid-2010s
at least, was functionally a stand-in for him. Erdogan may have
restricted his Islamist proclivities and international assertiveness
until he consolidated power in 2014-2016. However, Turkey's break with
the United States over the latter's invasion of Iraq, and Turkey's
growing hostility towards Israel, indicated a deeper rift between
Washington and Ankara. Erdogan consistently sought a greater regional
role; through diplomatic pressure against Israel culminating with the
Gaza Flotilla --- a bald-faced attempt to prompt a confrontation with
Israel --- Erdogan hoped to position himself as the spiritual leader of
the Islamic world. The Arab Spring, however, transformed the regional
balance. No power could pretend that the "Palestine Question" still
defined regional politics. The Libyan and Syrian civil wars, and the
subsequent rise of ISIS, thrust Islamism to the fore once again, while
Iranian expansion in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon demonstrated the relevance
of traditional coalition competition, rather than religious rivalry.
[[Turkey's response]{.mark} has been to sharpen its [shift]{.mark} away
[from the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates by alternating]{.underline}
between Russophilic and Russophobic [[policies]{.underline}.]{.mark} The
Levantine maelstrom that began in Syria and exploded in Iraq stoked
Turkish fears of Kurdish revanchism. Even before that, Russian presence
in Syria prompted Turkey to pursue a more aggressive policy, supporting
Islamist elements in the Syrian opposition and destroying a Russian
Su-24 that briefly violated Turkish airspace. Two years later, Turkey
agreed to purchase S-400 anti-air systems from Russia that, in 2019,
prompted its ejection from the West's F-35 fighter-jet program and U.S.
sanctions. More generally, [Turkey asserted itself militarily since
2016, intervening directly in Syria and Libya]{.underline}. In the
latter conflict, Turkey aligned with the Tripoli-based Government of
National Accord, opposing the Tobruk-based French-, Russian-, Emirati-
and Egyptian-supported House of Representatives. Although fighting there
has subsided, tensions may again explode --- and by striking a
territorial deal in Libya, Turkey can lay claims to the Eastern
Mediterranean's natural gas deposits, threatening Israel, Egypt and
Greece.

#### Erdogan threatened Greece 

**Buyuk 22** **(**Hamdi Fırat Büyük currently works as a Political
Analyst and a Journalist at the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network
(BIRN) in Sarajevo). "Turkey's Erdogan Warns Greece Not to Militarise
Aegan Islands," Balkan Insight, 6/10/22,
<https://balkaninsight.com/2022/06/10/turkeys-erdogan-warns-greece-not-to-militarise-aegean-islands/>)

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wrote on Twitter in Greek,
Turkish and English on Thursday **[that [Greece]{.mark} could [face a
"tragic ending]{.mark}"]{.underline}** if it militarises islands in the
Aegean Sea near the Turkish coast.

["We **warn Greece** once more to [avoid dreams, statements and actions
that will lead to regret, as it did a century ago, and to return to its
]{.mark}]{.underline}[senses]{.mark}," Erdogan said, in a reference to
Greece's defeat in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922.

"Turkey neither violates anyone's rights or law, nor lets anyone violate
its own," he declared.

Erdogan issued his statement on Twitter just hours after he observed a
large Turkish military exercise near the port city of Izmir, which is
only few miles away from Greek islands in the Aegean.

He hinted that use of force is an option if Greece does not comply.

[["Turkey]{.mark} will not relinquish its rights in the Aegean and [will
**not refrain from using the powers** g]{.mark}ranted to it by
international agreements [for the armament]{.mark} of the
islands]{.underline} when necessary," he said.

In the century-old dispute between Turkey and Greece over the Aegean,
the two countries have often quarrelled about the delimitation of
territorial waters and national airspace. [[Turkey rejects Greek claims
o]{.mark}ver certain areas of the Aegean and [claims that Athens has
been militarising islands which are supposed to be demilitarised
according to international treaties]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"Including demilitarised islands in various \[military\] exercises and
seeking to use NATO and third party countries as a tool in this
unlawfulness is nothing but an effort that will have a tragic ending,"
Erdogan said.

Erdogan's statements made headlines in both countries and Greek
politicians responded swiftly.

"We have a neighbour that is as isolated as it is angry," Greek Prime
Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said, *Kathimerini* newspaper reported.

Mitsotakis added that he will inform the EU and European leaders about
"Turkish provocations".

"It is noteworthy that President Erdogan chose to speak in Greek. It is
known that Greek is the language of logic, freedom and law. Its native
users and the Western world know this very well. The tactics chosen by
Turkey do not fall into any of these versions," Giannis Oikonomou, the
Greek government's spokesperson, wrote on Twitter.

Mutual hostility is nothing new in Turkish-Greek relations but [[**in
recent years** there have **been bitter rows over energy
supplie**]{.mark}**s** in the East Mediterranean, the Aegean islands and
the refugee crisis.]{.underline}

rapprochement between Ankara and Athens [but [the mood of optimism did

### AT: NATO Checks

#### NATO doesn't check -- Erdogan cut talks with Greece and US operations only increase tensions

Turkey and Cyprus, "Erdoğan says he is cutting all ties with Greek PM,
dashing hopes of talks,"

[Turkish president, said to be irked by growing US-Greece relations,
calls off meetings aimed at easing tensions]{.underline}

[A pledge by Turkey's president to cut all ties with the Greek prime
minister -- and a suggestion that [Kyriakos
Mitsotakis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/kyriakos-mitsotakis) was
dishonorable and lacking character -- has raised fears of renewed
tensions between the two Nato members.]{.underline}

Calling off talks between the countries, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused
Mitsotakis of deliberately antagonizing Turkey when
he [addressed](https://primeminister.gr/en/2022/05/17/29339) the US
Congress during a visit last week to Washington.

"This year we were supposed to have a strategic council meeting,"
Erdoğan said in a televised address on Monday. "From now on there is no
one called Mitsotakis in my book. I will never accept meeting him
because we \[only\] walk on the same path as politicians who keep their
promises, who have character and who are honourable."

The decision to freeze Greek-Turkish contact ends what many had hoped
would be a period of détente between the perennial foes after Mitsotakis
held talks with Erdoğan in Istanbul in March.

The seemingly constructive meeting, conducted over lunch, resulted in
the two men underlining the need for "increased cooperation" to improve
strained bilateral ties in view of the war in Ukraine.

But the Turkish leader, who will run for re-election next year, said
Mitsotakis had failed to keep his side of the deal.

"We had agreed not to include third countries in our disputes," he said.
"Despite this, last week, he had a visit to the US and talked at the
Congress and warned them not to give F-16s \[fighter planes\] to us."

Making the historic 17 May address, the Greek leader stopped short of
mentioning Turkey by name but warned Washington of the perils involved
in fomenting instability in the region if arms purchasing agreements
were adopted. His centre-right administration has announced a sevenfold
increase in [defence
spending](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/28/mike-pompeo-due-in-athens-amid-spiralling-tensions-between-greece-and-turkey) compared
with last year against a backdrop of increased air incursions by Turkish
jets.

["The last thing that Nato needs at a time when our focus is on helping
Ukraine defeat Russia's aggression is another source of instability on
Nato's south-east flank," Mitsotakis told Congress. "And I ask you to
take this into account when you make defence procurement decisions
concerning the eastern Mediterranean."]{.underline}

On Tuesday the Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, said Athens would
resist "falling into the trap" of escalating tensions needlessly. "There
is no need to answer in the same way," he said, expressing disbelief at
the Turkish leader's reaction to a speech that had, he claimed, not
deviated from any of the
positions [Greece](https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece) has long
held.

The two countries have been at loggerheads for decades over maritime and
energy issues, air and sea rights in the Aegean, the divided island of
Cyprus and, more recently, migration.

Friction over rival claims to offshore gas reserves in the Aegean and
eastern Mediterranean brought them to the [brink of war in
2020.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/11/mediterranean-gas-greece-turkey-dispute-nato)

But a strategic shift in US regional ties has also played a role in
creating disquiet among Turkey's military and political establishment.

**[Washington's growing desire to see Greece as a "reliable" partner --
expanding its military presence in the country and signing a mutual
defence accord unprecedented in scope with Athens -- has irked Ankara,
analysts say, noting Erdoğan's unpredictability]{.underline}.**

On Monday, the [Turkish leader raised the issue, saying: "At this moment
there are 10 bases in Greece. What is the reason? Who are they
threatening? For what reason are these bases being built in
Greece?"]{.underline}

Turkey's media has gone further, predicting a military attack being
launched from one of the installations.

Kostas Ifantis, a Turkish affairs specialist who heads the institute of
international relations at Athens' Panteion University, said with a
détente now "stillborn" the coming months could be a rollercoaster.

"[I think we are now looking at a **breakdown in
communications**]{.underline} in the short term," he said, predicting
increased Turkish activity on and around Cyprus. " Mitsotakis's visit to
Washington is very much perceived in Ankara to have undermined any
effort towards rapprochement. [Turkey realises that the US has gradually
reduced its strategic dependency on Turkish soil by increasing its
military presence in Greece]{.underline}."

For the first time in almost a year, the Greek coastguard said this week
it had stopped about 600 people from crossing into the Aegean from
Turkey -- raising further fears of Erdoğan using the country's large
refugee population to stoke tensions.

"Erdoğan is an unpredictable and dangerous neighbour. He weaponised
refugees in 2020 and he may do it again," said Pavlos Eleftheriadis, a
professor of public law at the University of Oxford. "But the Greek
government is also reacting in what appears to be an unlawful way by
conducting unlawful pushbacks of asylum seekers in the Evros \[River\]
and the Aegean Sea."

[Turkish Journalists Urge Govt to Drop Disinformation Law]{.underline}

[Turkish journalists and media organisations rallied in Istanbul to urge
the government to abandon its proposed disinformation law, which would
exert more official, control over media and internet
freedoms.]{.underline}

[Thousands of protesters from journalists' unions and NGOs gathered in
Istanbul and other cities across the country on Tuesday to call on the
government to drop the disinformation law which is due to be passed by
the Turkish parliament soon]{.underline}.

"It is called the 'Press Law', but it has been prepared without being
asked for by professional media organisations. There is no article in it
to protect journalists or protect the news," the journalists'
organisations including the Journalists' Union of Turkey, the Turkish
Journalists' Association and the Press Council said in a statement.

"On the contrary, prison sentences, closures, censorship and heavy
controls over internet media are coming," the statement added.

The legislation was presented to Turkey's parliament on May 27, aiming
to increase government control over the internet, media and social
media.

"We are describing this law as the heaviest censorship law in the
history of Turkey which will completely destroy the freedom of the press
and freedom of expression," the media organisations said.

"A journalist who does not disclose his news source under the name of
'fighting disinformation' will be given a prison sentence. Prosecutors
and judges will decide which news is 'false' and which news is 'true' in
line with the vague regulation," they warned.

[The law was prepared by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice
and Development Party, AKP and its far-right partner, the Nationalist
Movement Party, MHP]{.underline}.

[The law, which is expected to pass soon, for the first time defines the
crime of "spreading misinformation on purpose]{.underline}".

[It envisages punishment for anyone who "publicly disseminates false
information regarding internal and external security, public order and
the general welfare of the country, in a way that breaches the public
peace, simply for the purpose of creating anxiety, fear or panic among
the population]{.underline}".

According to the proposed law, people who spread misinformation can be
jailed for one to three years. If a court decides that a person spread
misinformation as part of an illegal organisation, the jail sentence
will be increased by 50 per cent.

Journalists can also be charged under the new law if they use anonymous
sources to hide the identity of a person who is spreading
misinformation.

Disillusionment

[After Turkey's disappointment regarding its status as an EU-member
state, AKP's popularity rose sharply. Erdoğan's government won the 2011
general election by a large majority. His rise to power was accompanied
by a new conservative, nation-centered revival]{.underline}.

Due to the reluctance of the ruling party to continue building the EU
accession project, a considerable turn in democracy-building occurred.
[This retroversion has been the fertile ground for [weakening efforts to
improve the cause of
women](https://ies.lublin.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/riesw_1732-1395_15-2-332.pdf)]{.underline}.
Hande Eslen-Ziya and Nazlı Kazanoğlu define De-democratization as "[the
weakening of human rights, more specifically the weakening of gender
equality discourses ".]{.underline} Such a definition could be compared
with the De-Europeanization process. Symansky defined it as the ["loss
of democratic quality, experienced by countries that modify their regime
from democratic to
non-democratic"](https://ies.lublin.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/riesw_1732-1395_15-2-332.pdf).

[This de-Europeanization process has been escorted by a certain
determination to de-construct policies implemented accordingly with EU
standards such as the one on women's rights]{.underline}.

The Consequence of the De-Europeanization of Women's Rights

It appears that in the new Turkish era, driven by the AKP government,
the understanding of women is based under the umbrella of family. After
the 2000s, [Turkey enhanced the [protection of conservative and
religious
values](https://thenewglobalorder.com/world-news/hagia-sophia-and-the-role-of-religion-in-turkeys-politics/) as
well as neo-liberal policies while favoring ['motherhood
behavior'](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19448953.2017.1328887).
According to President Erdoğan, giving equal status to women and men
would run counter to their fitrah: the 'God-given nature.' This
statement, which appreciates the conception of a divided and gendered
society, shines a spotlight on the implication of patriarchy. Indeed, it
seems that gender equality, a fundamental principle of human rights, is
against nature, this the decline of women's rights under the ['New
Turkey'](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13629395.2020.1765524) has
been in effect.]{.underline}

A certain gap between
the [Europeanizat](https://thenewglobalorder.com/tag/european-union/)ion
process led by policy reforms, and the reality of Turkish women's rights
have become more and more visible. The World Economic Forum's [2016
Global Gender Gap
report](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/GGGR16/WEF_Global_Gender_Gap_Report_2016.pdf) ranked
Turkey as 130 out of 144. The last [report of Freedom house
2020](https://freedomhouse.org/country/turkey/freedom-world/2020),
testifies the underrepresentation of women in positions of power within
the AKP government. Hence, in the last parliamentary election in 2018,
women won 104 seat,s which put their presence around 17 %. In light of
those rankings and despite the considerable legislative efforts to renew
Turkey's image by making it a master of progressivism, a paradox began
to emerge.

The Conservative Turn of Turkey

This mindset change emphasizes women's roles as mothers, wives, and
sisters. To protect the family vision
of [Turkey](https://thenewglobalorder.com/tag/turkey), the paradigm of
domestic violence has shifted. The ruling government considered
diminishing domestic violence protection to disincentivize women from
seeking a divorce. In [2016 the parliament recommended that ["women
should prove their partner's violence to receive extended police
protection"](https://freedomhouse.org/country/turkey/freedom-world/2020).]{.underline}

[Turkey's government does not seem to see violence against women as a
problem of inequality]{.underline}. It is rather considered to be a
potential threat to the domestic equilibrium. The failure to make
efforts to end violence against women manifests itself as a violation of
the Istanbul Convention, officially known as the Council of Europe
Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and
Domestic Violence, adopted in 2011. Turkey was the first signatory as
well as the first one to withdraw from it [on March 20,

The Abortion Case Study

On 25 May
2012, [President Erdoğan ](https://thenewglobalorder.com/tag/erdogan/)equated
abortion with murder saying, "there is no difference between killing a
baby in its mother's stomach or killing it after birth." Regarding this
statement, Mustafa Akyol said that "[politically this will serve
him](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0613/Turkey-s-culture-wars-heat-up-after-PM-equates-abortion-with-murder)"
since most people living in Turkey are against abortion. This turn on
the structuration of Turkish society goes along more Islamic
conservative lines at the expense of women's rights.

In his opening cannonade against abortion, President Erdoğan also
claimed that abortion was

"part of a plan to hold back Turkey's population from growing and be
part of the world's top 10 economies by 2023".

Indeed, women can fuel that economic rise by having "at least three
children", the Turkish president said. Erdoğan's government has paved
the way for constant acceleration of population growth where women are
purely playing a maternal role. Within the economic motivation of
Erdoğan, the place of women is fundamental in the sense that it actuates
procreation.

According to Alexander Christie-Miller, women are considered to be
determining factors to weigh in the balance of global competition.
[President Erdoğan's efforts to reduce access to abortion were meant to
protect Turkish society from Western deviances. Henceforth, the Turkish
government led a campaign to
ban [abortion](https://thenewglobalorder.com/tag/abortion)]{.underline}.
This campaign was not successful due to the resistance of feminist
organizations which all came together to protest the decision. Thus, in
theory, the government did not question the 1983 law authorizing
abortion. [In practice, however, under pressure from the Ministry of
Health, many public hospitals stopped performing abortions]{.underline}.
Across Turkey, "only 7.8 percent of the total of 431 public hospitals
perform abortions" announced [Kadir Has University

Women's Bodies: A Matter of State

Large photos depict the faces of women prevented from speaking by the
bloody hands on their faces. Source: [Discover
society](https://discoversociety.org/)

Abortion in [Turkey](https://thenewglobalorder.com/tag/turkey/) has
become a state matter, loosening the conservative philosophy of the
government. Women's bodies are being manipulated with the sole purpose
of serving the government's determination to curb Turkey's falling birth
rates. In his [interview Pouvoir et Savoir with
Hasumi](http://1libertaire.free.fr/MFoucault138.html), Foucault gave the
definition of power as a form of truth;

"Truth (...) is carried under the effect of multiple forms of
constraint. Each society has its own regime of truth: that is to say,
the types of discourse it accepts as true."

In the case of the current Turkish government, conservative norms and
thirst for economic power are the truth. Foucault mentions the fact that
the omnipresence of power results in 'the dressage of bodies'. Thus, the
so-called knowledge of the government forcibly penetrates the mentality
of the individuals whose bodies must submit to it. The abortion case
study highlights the willingness to conform women's bodies to the
discourse of truth of power. Henceforth, the instrumentalization of the
female body is at the service of the conservative and religious
conception of the state.

The fundamental freedom of women to make choices about their own bodies
comes into conflict with the interest of the state. Inevitably, this
collision violates the democratic principle of independence between the
provisions of legal power and government ideologies. Democratic
consolidation implies the process of freezing democratic norms. By
calling into question the right to abortion, the government is carrying
out a process of norm change that considerably endangers
Turkey's [democracy](https://thenewglobalorder.com/tag/democracy).

Feminism: The Dissenting Voice to be Shut Down

A strong democracy finds its roots in a developed and pluralistic civil
society (lobbying, information asymmetry, judicialization tactics,
etc.). As analyzed earlier, the reform of Ataturk gave the opportunity
to women to express themselves as individuals. The advancement of
Turkish [feminism](https://thenewglobalorder.com/tag/feminism) from a
group's perspective toward a more individual-oriented conception allowed
women's networking strategies to gain a major place within civil
society. The implication of the de-democratization process that followed
had a catastrophic impact on secular feminist organizations and on the
rights obtained by and for Turkish women.

The Government's Strategy of Homogenization

Sümeyye Erdoğan and her father, president Erdoğan
(Source: [Evrensel](https://www.evrensel.net/haber/280048/sumeyye-erdoganin-nikahi-nedeniyle-bazi-yollar-kapanacak))

In the light of the importance gained by the pro-government women's
organization, the hardening of the conditions of feminist organizations
became evident. Hence, to achieve the regeneration of a country based on
the fusion of conservative Islam and nationalism, the government
launched a collaboration with civil society women's organizations. Those
are ["often co-founded by relatives of AKP
leaders"](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/tangled-web-politics-of-gender-in-turkey/).
The multiplication of these collaborations has resulted in a tacit
agreement between women's movements and governments that have agreed
ideologically. The creation of the KADEM (Women and Democracy
Association) aimed at preserving traditional gender division within
Turkish society. A splendid coincidence considering that it is the
President's daughter, Sumeyye Erdoğan who runs this organization. Once
KADEM was founded ["it slowly blocked the communication between the
government and secular women's
organizations."](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341648425_De-democratization_under_the_New_Turkey_Challenges_for_women%27s_organizations) This
authoritarian drift involves the homogenization of opinions and the
stigmatization of criticism.

The Repression of Civil Societies

(Source: [Kronos34.news](https://kronos34.news/tr/carlos-latuff-erdogan-has-been-dragging-turkey-into-a-dictatorship-in-broad-daylight/))

[Following the public affront of the prominent feminist Pinar Ilkkaracan
denouncing KADEM as the ['government's fake civil society
organizations](http://kazete.com.tr/makale/vatikandan-kopya-gundemsal-cinsiyet-adaleti_1013%204)',
the president's daughter filed a lawsuit against her. Thus, in addition
to crushing feminist organizations, the government discredits the voice
of the opposition. They also prevented them from having a separatist
impact on the political scene.]{.underline}

Since debate and confrontation of ideas are necessary for the good
health of democracy, the homogenization of the conception of feminism
endangers its values of freedom. By empowering pro-government women's
groups, the tendency of the government to silence and, indeed, ignore
civil society, is symptomatic of the repressive and authoritarian drift
that Turkey is undergoing.

The Dismantling of Turkish Democracy

October 4, 2021, Ankara -- Restrictions on press freedom continue
sharply in Turkey. Journalists Büşra Taşkıran and Öznur Değer were
impeded by the police during their street interview in Ankara
(Source: [CFWIJ](https://womeninjournalism.org/cfwij-press-statements/turkey-press-freedom-continues-to-be-restricted-cfwij-condemns-police-obstruction-of-journalists-bra-takran-and-znur-deer))

A breakdown of the dismantling process of the Turkish democracy is
presented below.

The de-Europeanization process highlighted the considerable regression
in the status of women.

In the name of the current governmental ideology, the understanding of
gender has changed in favour of a biological and thus, asymmetric
perception.

Erdogan's determination to reduce feminist criticism undermines the
plurality of civil societies and the freedom of expression.

The lack of transparency has been reflected by the president's control
over women's organisations.

The conservative policy drifts dangerously towards threatening women's

The long-running dispute between the United States' NATO allies---Turkey
and Greece---in the Eastern Mediterranean and Aegean heated up over the
past year. A [[tussle over]{.mark} rights to drill for natural gas in
[contested waters sparked]{.mark} the latest round of [tensions]{.mark},
[but]{.mark} the [core issues]{.mark} of sovereign rights and differing
interpretations of international law [run much
deeper]{.mark}]{.underline}. As US President Joe Biden's administration
begins to implement its foreign policy, [it would be [worthwhile]{.mark}
for it [to draw lessons]{.mark} [from]{.mark} the [early]{.mark}
proponents of [US engagement in the region]{.mark} who highly valued the
United States' alliance with both Turkey and Greece. [The]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should]{.mark}, [in a neutral
manner]{.mark}, mediate and [manage]{.mark} [tensions between the two
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Both [Turkey and Greece]{.mark}, as well as the region, [need]{.mark}
[US]{.mark} [engagement]{.mark}. [No other country]{.mark} or entity [is
in a position to mediate]{.mark}, support, or, if necessary, pressure
[the two sides]{.mark} to productively coexist]{.underline}. The
European Union (EU), which has made efforts to assume greater
responsibility for the Eastern Mediterranean region, will, as long as
Greece and Cyprus are members and Turkey is not, never be seen by Ankara
as impartial. While there is a wide spectrum of opinion within the bloc
on how to approach Turkey on its relationship with Greece, from
confrontational to conciliatory, the EU will always skew in Greece's
favor for the sake of member-state solidarity.

NATO has been an effective platform for facilitating negotiations
between Turkey and Greece. Over the course of the past year, NATO
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg made a strong effort to de-escalate
tensions between the two countries. However, NATO lacks the authority of
a major power such as the United States.

On January 25, Turkey and Greece held high-level talks in Istanbul aimed
at reducing tensions. [The Biden [administration should]{.mark}
wholeheartedly [support]{.mark} this effort by [both countries to
resolve]{.mark} their [disagreements]{.mark} [on the basis of
international]{.mark} [law]{.mark}.]{.underline} It must be noted that
the implications of international law on the Turkish-Greek maritime
boundary and the resolution of disputes is
not [clear-cut](https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/whose-sea-turkish-international-law-perspective-greek-turkish-disputes).
Furthermore, Turkey and Greece's shared and entangled history has
created a unique geographic diffusion. Many Greek islands are visible
from Turkey's Anatolian mainland, hundreds of miles away from the Greek
mainland, which complicates boundaries and introduces a host of new
issues. Turkey holds, with good reason, that the multitude and
complexity of issues at stake---from delimitation of continental shelves
to access to airspace and demilitarization of islands in the Aegean
Sea---cannot be solved piecemeal. On top of that, the dispute over the
divided island of Cyprus looks no closer to being resolved.

US engagement with the region

US engagement in Southeastern Europe can be traced back to the
post-World War II era as US policymakers sought to counter and contain
Soviet geopolitical expansion. The Truman Doctrine, unveiled by then-US
President Harry Truman in 1947, called for substantial military and
economic support for Turkey and Greece. At the time, Greece was
embroiled in an intense communist insurgency and at far greater risk of
falling into the communist orbit. In Turkey, the United States saw an
opportunity to secure a willing and strategically located partner by
capitalizing on growing apprehension toward the Soviet Union as a result
of the Turkish Straits crisis---a Cold War-era territorial conflict
between Turkey and the Soviet Union. Turkey and Greece would both go on
to receive aid under the Marshall Plan and eventually join NATO in 1952.

Truman's foresight secured two important allies on the periphery of
Europe for the Western alliance. Moreover, it cemented US influence in
the region and formed the basis of US policy to balance the interests of
its two important partners, erstwhile adversaries, and promote stability
in the region. Turkey and Greece would not again face each other in war
as they had on four occasions in the previous centuries.

However, since early in its history, the triangular US-Turkish-Greek
relationship has been punctuated by crises. The dispute over the island
of Cyprus precipitated a major falling out between Turkey and Greece,
thrusting the United States into a mediating role that helped forestall
an all-out war but had limited overall success. Later, then-US President
Bill Clinton's personal intervention in the Imia/Kardak crisis of
1996---a dispute over sovereignty of the uninhabited Aegean
islets---proved critical in lowering tensions and staving off war
between Turkey and Greece.

US-Turkey ties deteriorate

At present, the United States' ability to mediate and manage tensions is
threatened by the changing dynamics of the US-Turkey-Greece
relationship. [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' slow
[disengagement]{.mark} from the region, which began [during]{.mark} the
[Obama administration]{.mark} and continued through the Trump
administration, has [coincided with a worsening of]{.mark} US-Turkey
[relations]{.mark}. This deterioration in the bilateral relationship has
been caused by a number of issues]{.underline}, the most challenging of
which has been Turkey's purchase of the Russian-made S-400
missile-defense system. In December 2020, then-US President Donald
Trump's administration imposed sanctions on Turkey under the Countering
America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) in response to its
purchase of the missile-defense system. Turkey's decision to purchase
S-400s has also drawn criticism from US policymakers, particularly those
in the US defense establishment, which had been among Turkey's
staunchest defenders in Washington.

Turkey, on the other hand, views US support for the Kurdish People's
Protection Units (YPG) militia as an existential threat and anathema to
the spirit of its relationship with the United States. The YPG is
acknowledged to be the Syrian affiliate of the Kurdistan Workers' Party
(PKK), which both Turkey and the United States have designated a
terrorist organization.

US-Greece ties flourish

At the same time, US-Greece bilateral relations have been flourishing
with intense diplomatic efforts bolstered by traditionally strong
lobbying by the diaspora community. This warming has led to reports and
speculation that a new strategic alliance between Greece and the United
States could serve as an [alternative to
Turkey](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-09-29/washington-boosts-support-for-greece-in-spat-with-turkey) and
that the United States is considering Greek islands as an alternative to
the [Incirlik](https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/us-considers-greek-islands-as-alternative-to-incirlik-air-base-in-turkey-senator-says) airbase
in Turkey.

The way forward

While a certain distancing between the United States and Turkey is
understandable, [[abandoning Turkey for Greece]{.mark} (or,
hypothetically, vice versa) [would not contribute to]{.mark} stability
and [peace]{.mark} in the region, and it would gravely impact US
interests.]{.underline}

[[Encouraging Greece to make concessions]{.mark} regarding its
maximalist claims in its disputes with Turkey [could]{.mark} arguably
[embolden]{.mark} [nationalistic]{.mark} political [forces]{.mark} in
Greece, weaken the chances for success of talks between Greece and
Turkey, and put the US-Greece relationship in jeopardy. [But it is the
responsibility of]{.mark} political [leaders to communicate]{.mark} to
and persuade their constituents of the virtues of striking a monumental
agreement as opposed to being intransigent]{.underline}. Indeed, the
world already witnessed an unfavorable outcome in 2004 when Greek
Cypriots rejected the Annan Plan for the reunification of Cyprus, which
the Turkish Cypriot community supported---the closest the two sides came
to healing the divided island.

[Hopefully, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [can maintain]{.mark}
its unique [position as a neutral]{.mark} [mediator]{.mark}
[while]{.mark} at the same time [leveraging]{.mark} its [relationship
with Greece]{.mark}, currently at an all-time high, [to
encourage]{.mark} holistic [dialogue with]{.mark} its other ally
[Turkey]{.mark}. [Through such a]{.mark} proactive [approach]{.mark},
[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [could]{.mark} help [resolve]{.mark}
one of NATO's longstanding [points of discord and reassert
itself]{.mark} as a problem solver in the region.]{.underline}

Amid the ongoing US-NATO war against Russia in Ukraine, tensions are
rising dangerously between NATO member states Turkey and Greece in the
Aegean Sea. [[The two]{.mark} countries [are holding war games aimed at
each other]{.mark}, trading accusations of disregarding international
treaties, and [violating]{.mark} each other's bor[ders with]{.mark}
[jet]{.mark} fighter[s]{.mark} [and warships]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan watches jet fighters fly past
during the final day of military exercises that were taking place in
Seferihisar near Izmir, on Turkey\'s Aegean coast, Thursday, June 9,
2022. (Turkish Presidency via AP)

The Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) Ephesus 2022 exercise, held in the Aegean
Sea and attended by more than 10,000 military personnel, ended last
week. Thirty-seven countries, including the United States and Italy,
participated in air, sea and land drills. Held in Seferihisar, only 1.5
kilometers from the nearby Greek island of Samos in the Aegean Sea, the
exercise was based on the scenario of a "military landing on an island."
It was widely treated in Turkish capitalist media as a threat against
Greece.

Greek media reported that during Greece\'s naval exercise Storm 2022,
which ended on May 27, Turkey sent "two F-16 fighter jets that violated
Greek airspace, reaching just two 2.5 nautical miles from the northern
port city of Alexandroupoli."

During the Ephesus 2022 exercise, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
accused Greece of militarizing Aegean Sea islands in violation of
international agreements. He warned Athens \'one last time\' on this:
"We invite Greece to stop militarizing the islands that have
non-military status and to act in accordance with international
agreements. I'm not joking, I'm speaking seriously."

Threatening to militarize Turkish islands if necessary to threaten
Greece, Erdoğan said, "We again warn Greece to avoid dreams, statements
and actions that will lead to regret, just as they did a century ago," a
reference to the Turkish war of independence against the British-backed
Greek invasion in 1919-1922.

A week ago, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Çavuşoğlu accused Greece of
violating its peace treaties with Turkey: "But what is another reason
for Greece to be aggressive? Greece\'s violation of the status of the
islands given to it in the 1923 Lausanne Treaty and 1947 Paris Treaty
under the condition of not militarizing them \[Greek islands in the
Aegean Sea\], and our raising this violation within the framework of
international law."

Cavusoglu added: "The sovereignty of the islands will be questioned if
Greece does not end its violation." This threat to "question" Greece's
sovereignty over islands it controls amount to a threat to invade them
and go to war.

The Greek Foreign Ministry reacted to the Ephesus-2022 exercise and
statements by Turkish officials on Twitter, writing, "Ankara poses a
threat to regional peace and security." On Thursday, Greek government
spokesman Giannis Oikonomou dismissed the Turkish claims, calling them
"Ahistorical claims and baseless myths that can neither challenge nor,
let alone, substitute for international law and international treaties."

Accusing Erdoğan of provocation, Oikonomou threatened, "It is clear to
everyone that our country has upgraded its geostrategic and geopolitical
footprint as well as its deterrent capacity to be able at any time to
defend its national sovereignty and sovereign rights."

A century after World War I began in the Balkans, NATO and the bourgeois
governments in the region again risk plunging the world into a
catastrophic war. In 2020, tensions between Turkey and Greece over
natural gas and sea borders in the eastern Mediterranean were defused by
EU and especially German mediation. Greek-Turkish talks resumed.
However, as the World Socialist Web
Site [warned](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/09/12/emed-s12.html), ["[History
shows]{.mark} such [conflicts]{.mark} [cannot be]{.mark} peacefully
[resolved under capitalism]{.mark}, [whether or not a]{.mark} temporary
Greek-Turkish [peace deal is]{.mark} somehow
[reached]{.mark}."]{.underline}

The US-NATO war on Russia in Ukraine has now inflamed the Greek-Turkish
conflict, turning the Aegean into an undeclared second front in the
NATO-Russia war.

The right-wing government of Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis
has unabashedly aligned itself with Washington's moves against Russia.
The Greek port of Alexandroupoli in the northern Aegean Sea has been
transformed into a major US military base. Alexandroupoli is also being
used to deliver weapons to Ukraine and to NATO forces along the border
with Ukraine in Romania.

[The [Turkish bourgeoisie has pursued]{.mark} [a]{.mark} cynical,
[two-faced policy on]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark} war on Russia. [On the
one hand, it]{.mark} has [backed NATO's]{.mark} Ukraine [policy]{.mark},
including the far-right coup NATO backed in Kiev in 2014, and armed Kiev
with armed Bayraktar TB2 drones. [On the other, it]{.mark} has [kept
diplomatic channels]{.mark} [with Russia]{.mark} open, greeting Russian
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Ankara, [and posed]{.mark} certain
[obstacles to]{.mark} the most [aggressive NATO moves]{.mark} targeting
Russia.]{.underline}

Ankara closed the straits linking the Mediterranean Sea to the Black Sea
coast of Ukraine and Russia to both NATO and Russian warships, blocking
a NATO naval attack on Russia. It also threatened to veto NATO's plans
to absorb Sweden and Finland and post NATO troops on Russia's northern
border with Scandinavia. The Turkish government was not objecting to the
war, however, but continuing its long-standing targeting of the Kurdish
people: it denounced Sweden and Finland for having ties to
Kurdish-nationalist organizations.

Washington responded to this veto threat by inviting Mitsotakis to give
a speech denouncing Turkey in the US Congress. During his
enthusiastically received speech, Mitsotakis blamed Turkey for the
division of the Mediterranean island of Cyprus and demanded a halt to US
F-16 sales to Turkey. US President Joe Biden also gave Mitsotakis strong
support.

Erdoğan condemned Mitsotakis\' trip, declaring that Mitsotakis "no
longer exists" for him. Erdoğan added that he viewed the US-NATO bases
in Greece, targeting Russia and growing Chinese economic influence in
the region, as a threat to his government, saying, "And, most
importantly, there are nearly a dozen bases in Greece. Whom does Greece
threaten with those bases?"

Workers in Greece, Turkey and internationally must be warned: the danger
that the conflicts in the Black Sea and the Balkans will escalate
uncontrollably into a world war is very great. In the third year of the
COVID-19 pandemic, prices are spiraling out of control as the financial
aristocracy massively increases its wealth. [[This]{.mark} has [provoked
strikes and protests]{.mark} internationally, and capitalist governments
are all terrified of the international eruption of the class
struggle.]{.underline}

In Greece, there have been protests against the arrival of NATO forces,
including the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, to threaten
Russia. Strikes have also broken out among rail workers against being
forced to ship US tanks towards the Ukrainian and Russian borders. This
follows a decade of savage austerity imposed by the European Union and
both Mitsotakis' New Democracy and the pseudo-left SYRIZA ("Coalition of
the Radical Left") governments.

In Turkey, the last year has seen an eruption of health care strikes
against the official mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and wildcat
strikes in auto, steel, mining, shipbuilding and other industries
against the devastating surge in prices. A one-day nationwide strike by
over 100,000 doctors in Turkey is set to begin today.

[[Erdoğan and Mitsotakis are]{.mark} nearly at war with each other, but
they are [united in the attempt to use militarism and nationalism to
divide the working class]{.mark} [and suppress]{.mark} the growing
[struggles on both shores of the Aegean]{.mark} Sea[. It is impossible
to tell where their]{.mark} reckless [military adventurism ends, and
where their]{.mark} incitement of [anti-worker chauvinism
begins]{.mark}. [The]{.mark} decisive [question]{.mark} this poses [is
unifying workers' struggles internationally in a socialist, anti-war
movement to bring down]{.mark} these [governments and transfer power to
the working class.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The tables have turned for regional
rivals [Greece](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/greece/) and [Turkey](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/turkey/) in
the realm of fighter jet acquisition plans, with [Greece headed for a
buy of]{.mark} [the]{.mark} Lockheed Martin [F-35]{.mark} just three
years after Turkey was kicked out of the [Joint Strike Fighter
program.](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/f-35-joint-strike-fighter/)]{.underline}

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told reporters on June 30 that
the country had submitted a letter of request "in recent days" to the US
government for a squadron of 20 F-35s, with options to buy an additional
squadron,[ the Associated Press
reported. ](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2022-06-30/greece-requests-f35-fighter-jets-6510677.html)

The Greek announcement came just a day after[ President Joe
Biden](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/joe-biden/) said that the United
States "should sell" F-16s to Turkey --- a statement that was heralded
as a breakthrough after Turkey's purchase of the Russian S-400 air
defense system in 2019 stymied US arms sales to Turkey and [got it
booted from the F-35
program](https://breakingdefense.com/2020/07/congress-pushes-pentagon-to-finally-kick-turkey-out-of-f-35-program/).

[Three [experts]{.mark} who spoke to Breaking Defense [say]{.mark}
Greece's [purchase of the F-35 is]{.mark} very [likely to be
approved]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} it [could]{.mark} further [drive a
wedge]{.mark} [between]{.mark} the already strained
[relations]{.mark}hip [of]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and Turkey]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"Given the strategic situation in the eastern Mediterranean, a Greek
F-35 purchase is inevitable, particularly with the \[Hellenic Air
Force's\] aging fleet," said Richard Aboulafia, managing director with
Aerodynamic Advisory. "Despite economic challenges, Greece has
prioritized a high level of defense spending. The only challenge is
availability, given the limited F-35 production ramp."

**[[An F-35 sale to Greece could inflame Ankara]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[where [there is **mounting rhetoric that the**]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} [using Greece as a pawn to
control Turkey]{.mark}** and concerns about the deepening relationship
between the two nations]{.underline}, said Nicholas Danforth, senior
visiting fellow at the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign
Policy. [But [that]{.mark} might **[not]{.mark} be [enough to
dissuade]{.mark}** US **[policy makers from]{.mark} [approving the
sale]{.mark},** he added.]{.underline}

"Historically, the United States has placed a huge priority on avoiding
conflict between NATO allies in the eastern Mediterranean. In the past,
that meant trying to maintain a very balanced position between Greece
and Turkey," Danforth said.

"[In time, [as frustration]{.mark} with Turkey has [mounted]{.mark},
[it's]{.mark} become [clear]{.mark} to people in Washington
[that]{.mark} [the]{.mark} real [threat]{.mark} in the region [is
Turkey's]{.mark} provocative [behavior]{.mark}. [There's]{.mark} been a
[declining concern with whether]{.mark} or not [improved cooperation
with Greece will antagonize Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}. I see a greater
growing conviction that the relationship with Turkey is a lost cause and
that US foreign policy has to do the best it can within that reality."

Meanwhile, [[Athens believes]{.mark} that the [Turkish threat is
real]{.mark}, [and that air superiority is critical]{.mark} for
countering that threat, Danforth said. "Greece is already convinced that
Turkish hostility \[and\] Turkey's malign intentions are baked in and as
a result are probably [less worried about]{.mark} particular steps they
take further [aggravating]{.mark} [Ankara]{.mark}."]{.underline}

A senior Turkish official said the US government didn't bring up the
sale of F-35s to Greece in its recent engagements with Ankara. The
official added his belief that Washington would maintain the diplomatic
and military balance between Turkey and Greece and would take into
account possible instability such sales could trigger in the region.
"This is why we believe Turkey's F-16 request would be fulfilled," the
official said.

The official added that Turkish military experts believe that the F-16
deal would put Turkey on par with the current Greek military --- or even
give air superiority to Ankara. [But if Greece were to get the
[F-35]{.mark}, it [would]{.mark} put [pressure]{.mark} on
[Turkey's]{.mark} homegrown [TF-X project]{.mark} to be successful as a
way of balancing capabilities]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Said the Turkish official: "We would of course criticize the US
government if they give F-35s to Athens. Not only would it change the
military balance, but also because they didn't supply the same system to
us."

No one would go on the record among current Turkish officials to discuss
the potential F-35 sale, but there is a long line of concerns from
retired generals against such a deal. For instance, retired Brig. Gen.
Nejat Eslen  proposed deploying the S-400 against the Greek F-35s in a
2020 interview to Russian state media.

Asked whether Greece actually has a military need for the F-35 or just
wants to get one over on Ankara, Jim Townsend, a former US deputy
assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO policy, said, "It's
both. It is definitely both."

"You need the political hook to get the money, and the military is more
than happy to push for it. They probably think the Turks eventually come
back to F-35, but the Greeks want to say 'we've already been there and
we'll have the leg upon the Turks because they'll only have F-16s, and
we'll be in the next generation.' It's national pride, not necessarily
meeting a specific NATO force goal," he said.

It's possible that a Greek F-35 deal could put pressure on Turkey to
take steps that would allow it to enter back into the F-35 program, said
Townsend, now with the Center for a New American Security. However, "I
don't think the Turks feel threatened by the Greeks," he added. "The
Turks worry more about the PKK."

While it's possible that Turkey could seek to throw a wrench into an
F-35 sale to Greece, the United States could retaliate against Ankara by
blocking Turkey's F-16 buy, Townsend said. "We have some leverage. It's
rare to have leverage over the Turks and I think F-16 is our main
leverage in a lot of ways."

Euros And Sense

While the experts agreed that the US government is likely to approve the
sale, one lingering question yet to be answered is how Greece will
ultimately pay for the F-35. The combined forces of the COVID-19
pandemic and war between Russia and Ukraine have sent the global economy
reeling, with nations in Europe and elsewhere dealing with surging gas
prices, a food shortage, and higher costs due to supply scarcity.

With a unit cost of at least \$78 million per F-35A conventional takeoff
and landing model --- a figure that is expected to increase due to
supply chain pressures --- and notoriously expensive operations and
maintenance costs, paying for multiple F-35 squadrons could be a
challenge for Greece even in the best of times. However, Greece's
economic system has only recently gotten back on its feet after the 2008
financial crisis spurred a series of bailouts.

Ultimately, the country could opt to cut its planned buy if it becomes
too costly or "get a scaled down version" of the plane "like buying a
car without hubcaps," said Townsend.

"Who knows how they eventually afford it? They don't seem to be worried
about borrowing, as a rule," he said. "I think what they do is they make
buying armaments a top priority because they feel this threat from
Turkey, but its also national pride and the ability to show the Turks
they can't take the Greeks for granted. Their economy has gone through
issues with debt, so whether they could buy as many F-35s as they plan
to or buy them at all is a good question."

[Aboulafia said that [Greece]{.mark} could also seek out [used
planes]{.mark} to try to [offset]{.mark} the initial [costs of acquiring
the F-35.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}However, that decision could
result in higher sustainment costs, as it is more expensive to maintain
older, early-model aircraft that may not have been updated with the
latest software and hardware.

### Non UQ -- Coop Now

#### Turkey already cooperates with the US on security

**NTI '21** (The Nuclear Threat Initiative is a nonprofit, nonpartisan
global security organization focused on reducing nuclear and biological
threats imperiling humanity., "Turkey Overview,"
<https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/turkey-overview/>) JHK

[As part of NATO's nuclear umbrella, **Turkey continues to host
approximately 50 U.S. tactical nuclear weapons on its territory** at
Incirlik Air Base]{.underline}. 5 While the Cold War-era B61 bombs serve
little military purpose, they provide tangible evidence of a continued
American commitment to Turkish security. There is ongoing debate in the
policy community about whether the United States should continue to
station tactical nuclear weapons in Turkey, given political instability
in Turkey and the wider Middle East. 6 However, [advocates for the
continued presence of **the weapons** argue that, although they **serve
little military purpose, they provide tangible evidence of a continued
American commitment** to Turkish security.]{.underline}

[The **United States plans to upgrade the B61 bombs to the B61-12** and
hopes to complete the process by 2024. 7 Currently, both U.S. aircraft
and some Turkish F16s can carry the B61, however, there is some
speculation over whether Turkey still maintains an operational link with
the B61s on its territory.]{.underline} 8 Additionally, the United
States halted a shipment of F-35 fighter jets to Turkey in 2019 over
Turkey's purchase of a Russian missile defense system. Some of these
jets were slated to be used with U.S. nuclear weapons. 9

Additionally, in September 2019, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
stated that it was unacceptable for nuclear-armed states to prohibit
Turkey from attaining nuclear weapons. Though he did not say if Turkey
would begin to pursue a nuclear weapons program, Erdogan's statement
fueled calls for the U.S. to remove its nuclear weapons from Turkey and
increased anxieties regarding the development of nuclear power plants in
Turkey. 10

Turkey's interest in civilian nuclear technology dates to at least 1956,
when the government founded the [Turkish Atomic Energy Authority
(TAEK)](https://www.nti.org/facilities/490/), Ankara conducts
sophisticated nuclear fuel cycle research and possesses two
small research reactors. The [TR-2 5MWt
reactor](https://www.nti.org/facilities/495/) is located at the [Cekmece
Nuclear Research Training Center](https://www.nti.org/facilities/496/),
and the ITU TRIGA MARK II is located at [Istanbul Technical
University](https://www.nti.org/facilities/500/). 11

Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AKP-led government is aggressively
pursuing nuclear energy. While the government's announcement in 2006
that it would install 5,000MW nuclear energy by 2015 (3 reactors) has
not proven feasible, the AKP remains politically committed to the
nuclear power program. 12 After a troubled tender process in 2008, the
government began assessing the sole bid for construction of Turkey's
first nuclear plant at Akkuyu from the Russian-led consortium
Atomstroyexport-Inter Rao-Park Teknik. 13 In May
2010, [Russia](https://www.nti.org/learn/countries/russia/) and Turkey
signed a Cooperation Agreement, under which Rosatom State Cooperation
will construct Akkuyu nuclear power plant. The plant will eventually
contain four reactors with a combined capacity of 4800
MW. 14 Construction is underway on the first unit. 15 Other nuclear
power projects in Sinop and the Thrace region remain in the planning
stages.

Turkey meets approximately 72% of its energy demand through imports, and
thus is actively pursuing nuclear energy to address this dependency. 16

purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense system, but these efforts
failed to deliver results and were quickly forgotten. The United States
had been reluctant to go forward with the idea at the time, and the
lesson from that experience is that, unless the parties have a shared
sense of understanding of and joint commitment to the process, its
chances of success are slim.[[[**U.S.

[[Turkey\'s]{.mark} annual [inflation jumped to a two-decade high of
69.97]{.mark}% in April]{.underline}, according to data on Thursday,
fuelled by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and rising energy and commodity
prices after last year\'s lira crash.

The surge in prices has badly strained households just over a year
before [[presidential]{.mark} and [parliamentary]{.mark} elections that
could [bring the curtain down on President Tayyip
Erdogan]{.mark}\'s]{.underline} long rule.

Erdogan first came to power as prime minister in 2003 before switching
the country to a presidential system, and the [unorthodox interest rate
cuts made last year under pressure [**from him** **have been blamed for

Month-on-month, consumer prices rose 7.25%, the Turkish Statistical
Institute said, compared to a Reuters poll forecast of 6%. Annually,
consumer price inflation was forecast to be 68%.

The surge in consumer prices was driven by a [105.9% leap]{.underline}
in the transportation sector, which includes energy prices, and a [89.1%
jump]{.underline} in food and non-alcoholic drinks prices, the data
showed.

Month-on-month, food and non-alcoholic drink prices rose the most with
13.38% and house prices rose 7.43%.

The lira dipped 0.9% to 14.8525 against the dollar after the release of
the data.

### No Link -- OCOs/Cyber

#### Turkey likes OCOs -- they see deterrence as their only route against national cyber threats

**SpaceWatch**, 06/20**17**, Independent Perspective on Space, "Turkey
Establishing a 'Cyber Army' To Counter National Cyber Threats",

[[Turkey]{.mark} [Establish]{.mark}ing a '[Cyber Army' To
Counter]{.mark} National [Cyber Threats]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The [Turkish government]{.mark} is in preparations to
[establish]{.mark} a [national cyber 'army' that]{.mark} will [tackle
national cyber threats against the country]{.mark}]{.underline},
according to the Turkish Minister for Transportation, Maritime Affairs,
and Communications Ahmet Arslan.

The announcement was made in the [[aftermath of]{.mark} the global
[WannaCry ransomware attack]{.mark} that affected over 300,000 computers
worldwide,]{.underline} but left most of Turkey and the Middle East
largely unaffected due to its weekend timing. [Still, the WannaCry
episode is being seen by policy makers everywhere [as a wake up
call]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"We survived these recent attacks unharmed as a country," said Arslan,
who noted that only one factory in Turkey ceased operations for a day
because it was part of the supply chain of French auto manufacturer
Renault, whose systems were affected by the WannaCry ransomware.

Yet Arslan is not content to have avoided serious damage from the
WannaCry episode, telling Turkish reporters that, "...[[they]{.mark} may
[pose a big]{.mark}ger [threat]{.mark} and danger in the following days.
That's why [we are strengthening the structure]{.mark} all the time.
Some 13,000 white hackers came to work in the public sector. [We are
building a cyber army]{.mark} with five groups]{.underline}."

"We formed centers and teams to intervene in cyber incidents starting
from 2013. We led the way for the formation of these centers and teams
in all institutions, not just the public sector. There is a beautiful
coordination on this issue. We notified the institutions about the
possibility of this recent cyberattack. We said, 'Update your defense
software and antivirus programs.' This was very important," he added.

[The [Turkish government started a recruitment drive]{.mark} in late
2016 [for]{.mark} hundreds of university graduates to work in [cyber
security]{.mark} after a tumultuous year that saw up to 90 million cyber
attacks and exploits targeting Turkish government and private sector
computers and networks]{.underline}.

The recruitment drive is being led by the Turkish government's
Information and Communication Technologies Authority (BTK), and new
recruits can expect to be paid a minimum of 6,000 Turkish Lira
(approximately U.S\$1,700) a month upon joining the BTK. According to
BTK officials, the new cyber security recruits can expect to work on the
frontlines of Turkish national security.

[2016 was a devastating year for Turkish cyber security after the 15
July 2016 attempted [coup]{.mark} that [involved]{.mark} a [large number
of]{.mark} active [measures in cyberspace]{.mark} by both the coup
instigators and by the government of President Erdogan. Additionally,
the [Erdogan]{.mark} government [endured]{.mark} several weeks of
[intense]{.mark} political [pressure]{.mark} as [Wikileaks]{.mark}
mounted a campaign not long after the attempted coup to [release
info]{.mark}rmation thought to be [embarrassing for
Ankara]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Turkey is experiencing a transition wherein it is trying to adapt its

and public organizations do not accord a high value to democratic
concerns. While effective government agencies are critical to enhance
national preparedness they are paradoxically unsuccessful in enhancing
organizational preparedness.]{.underline} [As a result, Turkey must
regard cyber security as a governance concern and decide which
organizations will lead cyber security efforts: either organizations
with highly capable technological infrastructure or organizations with
security mandates and experiences]{.underline}

sector [is part of]{.mark} [Turkey\'s]{.mark} digital
[transformation]{.mark} [that seeks to make the country a global
competitor in]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}.

[[Turkey aims to push]{.mark} the [a]{.mark}rtificial

revealed in its first strategic artificial intelligence (Al)
plan]{.underline}.

The strategy was launched in a public event held by the Presidency's
Digital Transformation Office and the Industry and Technology Ministry
on Tuesday.

The strategy foresees employing at least 50,000 people in the sector as
one among 24 other objectives in its plan by 2025.

The ceremony was attended by artificially intelligent characters and
holograms where Turkey's plans were presented. The five-year roadmap was
launched at Turkey\'s Informatics Valley in Gebze, Kocaeli, and was
developed with the collaboration of private, public, and academic
groups.

In August, the National Artificial Intelligence Strategic Plan report
was published with
a [preface](https://cbddo.gov.tr/SharedFolderServer/Genel/File/TR-UlusalYZStratejisi2021-2025.pdf) from
[Turkish President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan]{.mark}, [stating]{.mark}, "The
field of [a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence [is not a matter of
choice]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} one of [the]{.mark} [biggest]{.mark}
[bearer]{.mark}s [of our]{.mark} development
[goals]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[The [major tenets of the]{.mark} artificial intelligence ([Al)]{.mark}
strategy [include]{.mark} realising actions of [decision-making,]{.mark}
[exploring meaning]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [learning in dynamic
conditions]{.mark} unique to intelligent creatures by computer or
computer-controlled machines, according to [the official
report.](https://cbddo.gov.tr/SharedFolderServer/Genel/File/TR-UlusalYZStratejisi2021-2025.pdf)]{.underline}

"[We have made the [national]{.mark} artificial intelligence
([Al]{.mark}) [strategy to ensure]{.mark} that the digital
transformation is most [beneficial to society]{.mark}]{.underline},"
said Musyafa Varank, Minister of Industry and Technology, indicating
that Turkey is one of the few countries to develop such a plan..

"[The artificial intelligence will be an indispensable part of economic
and social fields in the very near future]{.underline}," Varank also
said while explains the plan\'s socio-economic aims.

[The [plan outlines]{.mark}
six [priorities](https://cbddo.gov.tr/uyzs) primarily centered around
supporting Turkey\'s Al initiatives and **[strengthening international
cooperation]{.mark}** in this field by training artificial intelligence
specialists and increasing employment , encouraging research,
entrepreneurship, and innovation, reaching to quality data and technical
infrastructure, and expediting structural and workforce
transformation]{.underline}.

The government would like to commercialise applications developed and
prioritise in public procurement and boost the number of MSc graduates
specialized in AI technology by at least 10,000.

"We will enter the top 20 countries in the international artificial
intelligence indices," Ali Taha Koc, Head of the Digital Transformation
Office of the Turkish Presidency said during the ceremony, highlighting
the importance of becoming an accurate Al data-sharing country.

The strategy forecasts a two-fold increase in market size and global AI
expenditures within five years. It also strives to enhance Turkey\'s
economic and technological independence by reinforcing indigenous
infrastructure and a structural transformation.

Efforts are still ongoing to establish institutions and 'unicorns'
similar to The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey
(TUBITAK) Artificial Intelligence Institute . When compared to the 2,000
US and Chinese startups, the number in Turkey is low at approximately
200 companies.

[Prepared by the Digital Transformation Office of the Presidency and the
Ministry of Industry and Technology, the strategy hopes to solidify
Turkey\'s artificial intelligence ambitions, and lay the foundation for
a more aggressive investment plan.]{.underline}

Just don't mention the surveillance state

To implement [the new
strategy](https://cbddo.gov.tr/SharedFolderServer/Genel/File/TR-NationalAIStrategy2021-2025.pdf),
the government will establish a National Artificial Intelligence
Strategy Steering Committee, which will help craft national policy on
all things AI.

[The country plans to focus on six strategic priorities -- educating
citizens in AI and increasing employment in the sector; supporting
research activities; entrepreneurship and innovation in the field of AI;
developing access to quality data and technical infrastructure; making
arrangements to \"accelerate socioeconomic adjustment;\" improving
international cooperation; and accelerating structural and workforce
transformation.]{.underline}

By 2025, these six aims (broken into 24 objectives and 119 more specific
measures) are expected to lead to a number of positive outcomes.

The country hopes to increase the contribution of AI to GDP to five
percent -- although it doesn\'t disclose the current level. It also
hopes to boost employment in the field of AI to 50,000 people, with
employment of AI specialists within central and local government public
institutions to reach 1,000 people.

[The number of graduates in the field of AI will be increased by 10,000
within five years. AI applications developed by the local ecosystem will
be prioritized in public sector procurement, and commercialization will
be supported.]{.underline}

[Turkey has promised \"an active contribution\" to the regulatory
studies and standardization processes of international organizations in
the field of **cross-border data sharing with reliable and responsible
AI**]{.underline}**.**

It pledged to launch at least one global initiative in the field of
natural language processing, and at least five spin-offs operating in
the field of AI technologies that will come out of public institutions
and companies.

Finally, the country said that it would become one of the top 20
countries in the rankings of the international AI indices.

\"Taking part in the field of artificial intelligence is not a matter of
choice,\" Turkey\'s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said.

\"Unknowingly, we are transforming from people struggling with nature to
individuals stuck between algorithms.\"

### No Link -- Satellites/5G

#### Turkey has a vested interest in satellites -- seen as a win for Turkish pride

**Daily Sabah** with AA, 12/19/**21**, Pro-government Turkish daily
published in turkey, "SpaceX launches Turkey\'s Türksat 5B satellite
into space,"
<https://www.dailysabah.com/business/tech/spacex-launches-turkeys-turksat-5b-satellite-into-space>,

[Turkey\'s new telecommunication satellite was launched]{.underline} on
Sunday by United States aerospace company SpaceX at 6:59 a.m. Turkish
time (3:59 a.m. GMT).

Türksat 5B, which launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in
the U.S. state of Florida, will reach its orbital slot of 42 degrees
East in 164 days. Then, a 45-day test process will begin.

The satellite produced by Airbus and transferred from France to the U.S.
on Nov. 29, is the most powerful Turkish satellite so far and will
increase its Ka-band capacity by over fifteenfold.

[It will be capable of transmitting data at more than 55
gigabits]{.underline}.

[[Türksat
5B](http://www.dailysabah.com/business/tech/turkey-to-launch-turksat-5b-satellite-on-dec-19-from-us) was
produced with contributions from Turkey\'s domestic industry. It is
expected to last more than 35 years and features a next-generation
electric-powered propulsion]{.underline} system. Besides Turkey, the
entire Middle East, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Mediterranean, North and East
Africa, Nigeria, South Africa and neighboring countries will be covered
by Türksat 5B. In a video message, President Recep Tayyip **[Erdoğan
hailed the launch as another \"moment of pride for Turkey and the
Turkish nation.\"]{.underline}** \"Today, we launched Türksat 5B, the
most powerful and highest-capacity communication satellite of our
country, into space. In this satellite project, we also opted for Space
X\'s Falcon 9 rocket,\" he said.

[Erdoğan also thanked Elon Musk and his company Space X for not bowing
down to \"the blackmail and pressure of the anti-Turkey
lobbies.\"]{.underline} [Erdoğan held a video call on Thursday with
Musk](https://www.dailysabah.com/business/tech/erdogan-thanks-musk-with-nft-for-helping-with-satellite-launch),
the founder of Space X, and discussed the launch process.

[Underlining that data transmission speed and capacity would see an over
fifteenfold increase with the launch of Türksat 5B, the Turkish
president added: \"In this way, broadband satellite internet services
will be provided to users within the coverage area, including on land,
sea and air vehicles in regions where internet access is
limited]{.underline}.\"

Deputy Minister of Transport and Infrastructure Ömer Fatih Sayan
meanwhile stated that Türksat 5B differs from other satellites with its
high internet capacity, adding that every single Turkish village will
have access to the internet in the coming period.

[Explaining that satellites are primarily used for broadcasting in the
media and television industry, Sayan said that the sector is now
shifting from broadcasting to providing internet services]{.underline}.

Sayan also commented on the expansive area Türksat 5B will cover, noting
that the satellite will cater to a large part of Africa and almost the
entire Mediterranean as well as Turkey.

In addition to providing broadcasting and internet services to the
regions, Sayan noted that "As of today, the internet of our nearly 2,000
village schools is provided by Türksat. With Türksat 5B, we will use our
Türksat satellites much more effectively in order not to leave villages
without internet in Turkey."

Sayan added that the satellite, which took over three years to produce,
will be in service for 30-35 years.

Head of the Presidency\'s Digital Transformation Office Ali Taha Koç
commented on the domestically produced parts in the satellite, stating
that a transceiver system produced by Turkish defense giant Aselsan is
being sent into space over Türksat 5B and will be used in space for the
first time.

["Most of the satellites we have sent so far have been low-orbit
satellites, but for the first time, a domestic product has been tested
at a high orbit distance of 36,000 kilometers (22,369.36 miles), it has
passed all the criteria and is now above Türksat 5B]{.underline}," he
said.

"Aselsan's product will now go down in history," Koç said, adding that
the local product will be available to other countries when building
satellites from now on.

"We took a risk here to support domestic and national production.
Currently, these products have not been used in any satellite," he said.

[The construction of the domestic communication satellite Türksat 6A,
one of Turkey\'s most important projects, is also proceeding at full
speed]{.underline}. The sub-systems, satellite ground station and
software to be used in the satellite are being developed entirely with
domestic means.

While the engineering model equipment and system production of Türksat
6A is completed, system level tests continue at the Satellite Systems
Integration and Test Center.

After the system level tests of the engineering model are completed,
flight model integration and tests will continue. [The Türksat 6A
communication satellite is expected to be launched into space in
2023.]{.underline}

Another one of Turkey\'s satellites, [Turksat
5A](http://www.dailysabah.com/business/tech/turksat-5a-comes-online-to-secure-turkeys-orbital-rights-for-35-years),
was also launched by SpaceX in January.

[With Turksat 5B, Turkey currently has a total of eight active
satellites]{.underline}.

projects]{.underline} (e.g. highways, dams, housing and infrastructure),
[and environmental problems that adversely affect agriculture, such as
soil erosion and deforestation.]{.underline} [Furthermore, Turkey lies
in a region prone to natural disasters, especially earthquakes,
landslides, flooding and forest fires. Successfully overcoming these
challenges requires continuous monitoring to enable rapid response as

regard, space-based earth observation (EO) systems play a critical role
in the rapid acquisiton and extraction of crucial
information]{.underline}. [The first launch of the first

Erdoğan underlined that the sector was the most important in the
country\'s economy, following the defense industry, adding that during
difficult times, Turkey could only rely on its own production and
manufacturing infrastructure to survive.

\"[However, we have unfortunately faced veiled resistance in our steps
to develop a domestic and national pharmaceutical industry and

### No Link -- Subs

#### Turkey likes subs

**Daily Sabah**, 4/23/**22**, Pro-government Turkish daily published in
turkey, "Turkey to complete domestically made submarine in 6 months,"
<https://www.dailysabah.com/business/defense/turkey-to-complete-domestically-made-submarine-in-6-months>,
BradAs

[President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Monday that Turkey expects to
complete and deliver the domestically made submarines to the Turkish
Naval Forces Command within five to six months.]{.underline}

Speaking at a ceremony for the docking of the Hızır Reis submarine and
the first welding of the Selman Reis submarine at Gölcük Shipyard
Command in northwestern Kocaeli province, [the president said Turkey
aims to take into service a new domestically made submarine each year,
to ensure that the navy has six new submarines by 2027.]{.underline}

\"[Our submarines, which weigh 1,856 tons above water and 2,042 tons
when submerged, can go to a depth of more than 300 meters. Our
submarines, which can operate for three days underwater, can stay in
water for 12 weeks without the need for resupply. The submarines, which
are equipped with effective weapons against underwater, surface and land
targets, have the ability to launch various types of torpedoes,
missiles, and mines. We are also integrating our national torpedo Akya
and our national anti-ship missile Atmaca into our submarines with
air-independent propulsion capability,]{.underline}" Erdoğan said.

The president added that the Hızır Reis submarine will be put into
service in 2023 and the Selman Reis in 2027.

"Starting from this year, we will put one of our submarines into service
every year, and we will add six new type submarines to our navy until
2027.\"

\"We have realized many projects that will render our navy stronger and
more deterrent for the security of the Blue Homeland,\" Erdoğan added.

\"[Nearly 30 domestic companies of ours have assumed responsibility in
this critical project with their designs and productions for submarine
platforms and underwater technology]{.underline}. Moreover, many other
companies of ours are contributing as subcontractors to the production
process of our submarines. I thank on behalf of myself and my nation all
who have contributed to the production of these submarines that will add
to our strength in seas,\" the president said.

Erdoğan also highlighted the recent boost in Turkey\'s defense industry,
saying that the reliance on external sources has been minimized.

\"[While the foreign dependency in the defense industry was 80% when we
took office, we have today reached a domestic and national production
rate of over 70%. We are currently carrying out more than 750 defense
industry projects half of which we have launched in the past five
years]{.underline}. We have realized many projects that will render our
navy stronger and more deterrent for the security of the Blue
Homeland,\" he added.

The president also added that Turkey\'s preparations for the
domestically designed submarine, MILGEM, which is expected to be built
with mostly domestically developed systems also continues. \"We will
begin building the MILGEM in 2025 in Gölcük Shipyard,\" he said.

The MILGEM (National Ship) marine platforms project is a Turkish warship
program that aims to develop multipurpose corvettes and frigates that
can be deployed in a range of missions.

[These include reconnaissance, surveillance, early warning,
anti-submarine warfare, surface-to-surface and surface-to-air warfare,
and amphibious operations]{.underline}.

But [war could still be much **less likely**]{.underline}. The
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Barry [Posen]{.underline} has already considered the likely impact of
the current pandemic on the probability of war, and
he [believes]{.underline}  [COVID-19 is more likely to promote peace
instead]{.underline}. He argues that [the current
pandemic]{.underline} is affecting all the major powers adversely, which
means it [isn't creating tempting windows of opportunity for unaffected
states while leaving others weaker and therefore
vulnerable]{.underline}. Instead[, it is making
all]{.underline} **[governments more pessimistic]{.underline}** [about
their short- to medium-term prospects]{.underline}. Because [states
often go to war out of sense of overconfidence]{.underline} (however
misplaced it sometimes turns out to be), [pandemic-induced pessimism
should be]{.underline} **[conducive to peace]{.underline}**.

Moreover, [by its very nature war requires states to assemble lots of
people in]{.underline} **[close proximity]{.underline}**---at training
camps, military bases, mobilization areas, ships at sea,
etc.---and [that's not something you want to do in the middle of a
pandemic]{.underline}. For the moment at least, beleaguered governments
of all types are focusing on convincing their citizens they are doing
everything in their power to protect the public from the disease. Taken
together, [these considerations might explain why even an impulsive and
headstrong warmaker like Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman has gotten
more interested in winding down his brutal and unsuccessful military
campaign]{.underline} in Yemen.

Posen adds that [COVID-19 is also likely to]{.underline} **[reduce
international trade]{.underline}** in the short to medium term. Those
who believe economic interdependence is a powerful barrier to war might
be alarmed by this development, but he points out that [trade issues
have been]{.underline} a source of considerable friction [in recent
years---especially between the United States and China---and a degree of
decoupling might]{.underline} **[reduce
tensions]{.underline}** [somewhat]{.underline} [and cause
the]{.underline} [odds of war to recede]{.underline}.

For these reasons, [the pandemic itself may be]{.underline} **[conducive
to peace]{.underline}**. [But what about the relationship between
broader economic conditions and the likelihood of war]{.underline}?
Might a few leaders still convince themselves that provoking a crisis
and going to war could still advance either long-term national interests
or their own political fortunes? Are the other paths by which a deep and
sustained economic downturn might make serious global conflict more
likely?

One familiar argument is [the so-called]{.underline}
[diversionary]{.underline} (or "scapegoat") [theory]{.underline} [of
war]{.underline}. It suggests that leaders who are worried about their
popularity at home will try to divert attention from their failures by
provoking a crisis with a foreign power and maybe even using force
against it. Drawing on this logic, some Americans now worry that
President Donald Trump will decide to attack a country like Iran or
Venezuela in the run-up to the presidential election and especially if
he thinks he's likely to lose.

[This outcome]{.underline} [strikes me as unlikely]{.underline}, even if
one ignores the logical and empirical flaws in the theory itself. [War
is always]{.underline} [a gamble, and should things go badly---even a
little bit---it would]{.underline} **[hammer the last
nail]{.underline}** [in the coffin]{.underline} of Trump's declining
fortunes. Moreover, [none of the countries]{.underline} Trump might
consider going after [pose an]{.underline} **[imminent
threat]{.underline}** [to U.S. security]{.underline}, and even his
staunchest supporters may wonder why he is wasting time and money going
after Iran or Venezuela at a moment when thousands of Americans are
dying preventable deaths at home. [Even a successful military action
won't put Americans back to work, create the sort of testing-and-tracing
regime that competent governments around the world have been able to
implement already]{.underline}, or hasten the development of a vaccine.
The [same]{.underline} logic [is likely to]{.underline} guide **[the
decisions of]{.underline}** **[other world leaders too]{.underline}**.

### No Internal Link -- Diversionary War False

**No diversionary war**

**Boehmer '7** -- political science professor at the University of Texas
\[

Charles, Politics & Policy, 35:4, "The Effects of Economic Crisis,
Domestic Discord, and State Efficacy on the Decision to Initiate
Interstate Conflict", WEA\]

This article examines the contemporaneous effect of low economic growth
and domestic instability on the threat of regime change and/ or
involvement in external militarized conflicts. Many [studies of
diversionary conflict argue that lower]{.underline} rates of
economic [growth should heighten the risk of international
conflict]{.underline}. Yet we know that militarized interstate
conflicts, and especially wars, are generally rare events whereas lower
rates of growth are not. Additionally, a growing body of literature
shows that regime changes are also associated with lower rates of
economic growth. The question then becomes which event, militarized
interstate conflict or regime change, is the most likely to occur with
domestic discord and lower rates of economic growth? [Diversionary
theory claims that leaders seek to divert attention away from domestic
problems such as a bad economy]{.underline} or political scandals, or to
garner increased support prior to elections. Leaders then supposedly
externalize discontented domestic sentiments onto other nations,
sometimes as scapegoats based on the similar in-group/out-group dynamic
found in the research of Coser (1956) and Simmel (1955), where foreign
countries are blamed for domestic problems. This process is said to
involve a "rally-round-the-flag" effect, where a leader can expect a
short-term boost in popularity with the threat or use of force
(Blechman, Kaplan, and Hall 1978; Mueller 1973). Scholarship on
diversionary conflict has focused most often on the American case1 but
recent studies have sought to identify this possible behavior in other
countries.2 The Falklands War is often a popular example of diversionary
conflict (Levy and Vakili 1992). Argentina was reeling from
hyperinflation and rampant unemployment associated with the Latin
American debt crisis. It is plausible that a success in the Falklands
War may have helped to rally support for the governing Galtieri regime,
although Argentina lost the war and the ruling regime lost power. How
many other attempts to use diversionary tactics, if they indeed occur,
can be seen to generate a similar outcome? The goal of this article is
to provide an assessment of the extent to which diversionary strategy is
a threat to peace. [Is this a colorful theory kept alive by academics
that has little bearing upon real events]{.underline}, or is this a real
problem that policy makers should be concerned with? If it is a strategy
readily available to leaders, then it is important to know what domestic
factors trigger this gambit. Moreover, to know that requires an
understanding of the context in external conflict, which occurs relative
to regime changes. [Theories of diversionary
conflict]{.underline} [usually]{.underline} [emphasize]{.underline} [the
potential]{.underline} [benefits]{.underline} [of diversionary tactics,
although]{.underline} [few
pay]{.underline} [equal]{.underline} [attention to]{.underline} [the
prospective]{.underline} [costs]{.underline} associated with such
behavior. It is not contentious to claim that leaders typically seek to
remain in office. However, [whether they can successfully manipulate
public opinion]{.underline} regularly during periods of domestic
unpopularity [through]{.underline} their states' participation in
foreign militarized [conflicts]{.underline}---especially outside of the
American case---[is]{.underline} a question [open for
debate]{.underline}. Furthermore, there appears to be a logical
disconnect between diversionary theories and extant studies of domestic
conflict and regime change. Lower rates of economic growth are purported
to increase the risk of both militarized interstate conflicts (and
internal conflicts) as well as regime changes (Bloomberg and Hess 2002).
This implies that [if leaders]{.underline} [do]{.underline}, in
fact, [undertake diversionary conflicts, many may still be thrown
from]{.underline} the seat of [power---especially if the outcome is
defeat]{.underline} to a foreign enemy. Diversionary conflict would thus
seem to be a risky gambit (Smith 1996). [Scholars]{.underline} such as
MacFie (1938) and Blainey
(1988) [have]{.underline} nevertheless [questioned the validity
of]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [diversionary]{.underline} [thesis]{.underline}.
As noted by Levy (1989), this perspective [is rarely formulated as a
cohesive]{.underline} and comprehensive [theory]{.underline}, and there
has been little or no knowledge cumulation. Later analyses do not
necessarily build on past studies and the discrepancies between
inquiries are often difficult to unravel. "[Studies have used a variety
of research designs]{.underline}, different dependent variables (uses of
force, major uses of force, militarized disputes), different estimation
techniques, [and different data sets]{.underline} covering different
time periods and different states" (Bennett and Nordstrom 2000, 39). To
these problems, we should add a lack of theoretical precision and
incomplete model specification. By a lack of theoretical precision, I am
referring to the linkages between economic conditions and domestic
strife that remain unclear in some studies (Miller 1995; Russett 1990).
Consequently, extant studies are to a degree incommensurate; they offer
a step in the right direction but do not provide robust cross-national
explanations and tests of economic growth and interstate conflict. Yet a
few studies have attempted to provide deductive explanations about when
and how diversionary tactics might be employed. Using a Bayesian
updating game, Richards and others (1993) theorize that while the use of
force would appear to offer leaders a means to boost their popularity, a
poorly performing economy acts as a signal to a leader's constituents
about his or her competence. Hence, [attempts to use
diversion]{.underline} [are likely
to]{.underline} [fail]{.underline} [either]{.underline} [because
incompetent leaders]{.underline} [will likewise]{.underline} [fail in
foreign policy or people]{.underline} [will]{.underline} [recognize the
gambit]{.underline} [for what it is]{.underline}. Instead, these two
models conclude that diversion is likely to be undertaken particularly
by risk-acceptant leaders. This stress on a heightened risk of removal
from office is also apparent in the work of Bueno de Mesquita and others
(1999), and Downs and Rocke (1994), where leaders may "gamble for
resurrection," although the diversionary scenario in the former study is
only a partial extension of their theory on selectorates, winning
coalitions, and leader survival. Again, how often do leaders fail in the
process or are removed from positions of power before they can even
initiate diversionary tactics? A few studies focusing on leader tenure
have examined the removal of leaders following war, although almost no
study in the diversionary literature has looked at the effects of
domestic problems on the relative risks of regime change, interstate
conflict, or both events occurring in the same year.3

Conflict,"

3\. Theoretical framework 3.1 Diversionary War theory First, let us look
at the founding theory again. [The]{.underline} [Diversionary war
theory, as previously]{.underline} [explained,
is]{.underline} **[claimed]{.underline}** [to be
an]{.underline} **[explanation of the outbreak of war]{.underline}**.
The theory assumes that in times of domestic turmoil or discontent,
leaders initiate conflict in the international arena in order to divert
the citizens\' attention away from the politically unpopular domestic
situation, thus making sure they stay in office. The breakout of a large
number of conflicts in history, from the Middle Ages to modern times,
has been explained in terms of diversionary use of force. The actions of
Napoleon III have been interpreted as frequent uses of diversionary
tactics: not only did the Emperor provoke the Crimean war (1852-1856) to
"divert the eyes of Frenchmen from their own government\'s weaknesses"
(Blainey, 1988:72), but also the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 has been
interpreted in the same way. Perhaps the most well-known example is the
RussoJapanese war of 1904. The Russian Interior Minister at that time,
Plehve, is cited in the memoirs of Count Witte, Minister of Finance, as
saying "you are not familiar with Russia\'s internal situation. We need
a little victorious war to stem the tide of revolution" (Blainey,
1988:76). [The theory has been]{.underline} widely supported and is
a [long-lived]{.underline} one, appearing long before the established
scholarly field of International Relations. Historically, it has been a
conventional wisdom on the outbreak of war, based upon a number of ad
hoc observations rather than a well-established theoretical scientific
hypothesis. As Morgan and Bickers put it: "virtually every war since
1800 has been attributed, at least in part, to efforts of state leaders
to deal with domestic problems" (Morgan and Bickers, 1992:27). However,
throughout the years, this enigma has become widely researched by
political scientists, resulting in a more developed theory. What
theoretical arguments do the advocates of the Diversionary War theory
rely upon? In summary, the main mechanisms of the DWT have said to be
three: The In-group/Out-grouphypothesis or Rally-Round-The-Flag-Effect,
Scapegoating and Gambling for Resurrection (Chiozza and Goemans,
2003:445). The first one, the In-group/Out-group theory, or
conflict-cohesion theory, originates from the field of sociology and the
two sociologists Simmel and Coser. It suggests that identities of a
group, in this case national identities, become stronger in times of
external threats -- that the in-group identity becomes more united
during conflicts with the out-group (Levy, 1989:261). The
Rally-Round-The-FlagEffect is a consequence of this. Not only does
external pressure strengthen the group identities -- in addition, it
also leads to the group\'s unification around leader. The tenure of the
leader should therefore be extended in times of external crisis (Chiozza
and Goemans, 2003:445). However, for the theory to be effective, there
are some conditions that should be met: the group has to be fairly
salient to begin with, has to already perceive itself as a group and
also view the survival of the group as something worthwhile (Levy
1989:261). In addition, Simmel recognized that the outcome of conflict
might be of importance: "\[War\] might either cause domestic quarrels to
be forgotten, or might on the contrary aggravate them beyond
reconciliation" (Levy, 1989:261). The second mechanism, Scapegoating,
means that leaders retort to war to shift the blame of failed policies
onto the states enemies (Chiozza and Goemans, 2003:445). This is a
consequence of the first theory, implying that leaders are aware of the
psychological effect external pressure has on national identity and, in
turn, their own tenure. The third mechanism, Gambling for resurrection,
stemming from rational choice literature, argues that state leaders who
are confronted with a possible loss of power can afford starting a
foreign conflict, since their risk of losing office is imminent. If
creating a conflict increases their chance of staying in office even by
a small percentage, it would be worth it (Chiozza and Goemans,
2003:446). Consequently, we should be able to observe the following
patterns or mechanisms, according to the theory: When a domestic issue
in a state threatens the legitimacy or political power of the ruling
elite, said elite should a) be likely to use aggressive foreign policy
behaviour as a tool to divert the attention of the public from the
domestic issue, since a) the leaders are aware that the people will
become more united or nationalistic under such external pressure, b) the
people will give more support to the leader leading to c), a return of
the popular support of the political elite. [However]{.underline}, as
already touched upon in the introduction, [most of the research in
support of the]{.underline} [DWT have
been]{.underline} [either]{.underline} **[backed up by anecdotal
evidence]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[lack quantitative
evidence]{.underline}**, [which]{.underline} [leads
to]{.underline} [both]{.underline} [**theoretical and empirical
issues**.]{.underline} 3.2 The Critiques of Diversionary War Theory [The
Diversionary War theory has been]{.underline} **[heavily
criticized]{.underline}** throughout the years.
Only **[few]{.underline}** modern **[scholars]{.underline}** working on
the subject [ultimately]{.underline} **[support the initial
theory]{.underline}**. The main critique against the DWT is that [there
are]{.underline} **[insignificant links]{.underline}** [between the
theory and the empirical findings]{.underline} (Levy, 1989:282). [The
historical and theoretical literature strongly suggests that political
leaders should use diversionary force to strengthen their own positions,
while]{.underline} the **[empirical studies, often
quantitative]{.underline}**, [have found]{.underline} little or **[no
support for the relationship]{.underline}** between domestic strife and
foreign conflict. The reasons for this are, in summary, two: 1. There
might be something wrong with the theory itself. 2. The methodology used
(mostly statistical analysis of a large number of states) might not be
the right one (Morgan and Bickers, 1992:28). Regarding the theory, [the
idea that external enemies unite the group]{.underline} **[might not
be]{.underline}** as **[strong]{.underline}** as initially thought. As
Simmel himself explained, [the in-group/out-group theory
needs]{.underline} **[strict]{.underline}** **[conditions]{.underline}** to
work -- [one of them is the in-group being fairly
small]{.underline}. [Thus,]{.underline} **[extrapolating]{.underline}** the
concept from small group psychological behaviour [into]{.underline} [a
large, complex entity as modern
day]{.underline} [states]{.underline} [might
be]{.underline} **[difficult]{.underline}** (Morgan and Bickers
1992:32). Although commonly treated almost as a general law, some
scholars have paid attention to under what circumstances diversionary
tactics would be used. The level of internal conflict should matter for
the use of diversionary tactics. [If the]{.underline} [level of internal
conflict]{.underline} [is]{.underline} too [low]{.underline}, [aggressive
foreign policy should be an exaggerated tool]{.underline} to use. [If
the level]{.underline} of internal conflict
instead [is]{.underline} too [high]{.underline}, [it
would]{.underline} [not]{.underline} [be]{.underline} [wise to turn to
diversionary]{.underline} [tactics]{.underline}. Blainey noted that
during open civil war, [diversionary]{.underline} use of [force is rare
since]{.underline} [states]{.underline} **[turn
to]{.underline}** **[deal
with]{.underline}** **[their]{.underline}** **[internal
issue]{.underline}** **[first]{.underline}** [as a]{.underline} [part
of]{.underline} [its]{.underline} **[rational
calculations]{.underline}** (Blainey, 1988:86). In conclusion, we should
only be able to observe diversionary actions at the moderate levels of
internal strife. Another issue with the Diversionary War theory has to
do with the assumptions that it makes regarding the management of
conflict (or war). It presumes that war is something that can be easily
managed. However, [war requires a]{.underline} **[warring
opponent]{.underline}** [who]{.underline} the [state
leaders]{.underline} **[cannot control]{.underline}**. [The situation is
very likely to]{.underline} **[get out of hand]{.underline}** and
therefore [open]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline} [should]{.underline} [probably
be an]{.underline} **[unlikely goal]{.underline}** **[for
leaders]{.underline}** who seek to divert the attention of the public.
Thus, actions short of war, like escalation of threat of force should be
observable (Morgan and Bickers, 1992:29). However, this has also been
challenged. Rummel, conducting a study on the link between internal and
external conflict upon 77 states between 1955-57 found that "foreign
conflict behavior is generally completely unrelated to domestic conflict
behavior" (Levy 1989:262). These two facts about the variables give us
some clue to why the quantitative studies that have been conducted might
fail to produce any results in favor of the DWT. Large scale studies of
the relationship between domestic strife and foreign conflict using
correlation analysis and regressions all rely on the assumption that the
relationship between the variables should be linear. The problem is that
the theory does not imply that this is the case. Rather, the
relationship should differ depending on the level of internal strife.
There are more clues as to why the large, statistical analyses have
failed to produce any results. One reason could be that scholars mainly
have focused on correlations rather than offering any explanations
through causality. One such scholar is Blainey. In his observations, he
finds support for the linkage between civil strife and foreign conflict,
but not due to diversionary actions. Instead, a state torn by civil
strife often end up in conflict because it is perceived as weakened, and
thus easily become a target for other states seeking to exploit the
shift in power balance (Blainey 1988:82). It has also been argued that
the direction of the relationship between internal and external conflict
could be reversed. Foreign conflict could easily lead to internal
turmoil and finally revolution at the home front, giving us
internalization of external conflict rather than externalization of
internal conflict (Levy, 1989:267). However, that this could happen
would not per se be a problem for the theory -- it is only problematic
when the direction of the relationship is unaccounted for, given that
there probably should be different casual mechanisms active during
externalization and internalization of conflict, which would affect the
results. In summary, the biggest obstacle to the research is a common,
cumulative theoretical framework. As Levy puts it: "Little attention is
given to questions of under what kinds of conditions what kind of states
resort to what kinds of external conflict in response to what kinds of
threats to the security of political elites" (Levy, 1989:283). 3.3
Diversionary Peace Theory [The]{.underline} **[Diversionary Peace
Theory]{.underline}**, as put forward by Fravel [is
an]{.underline} **[alternative critical
engagement]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} the **[Diversionary War
Theory]{.underline}**. [In a case study
on]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[its]{.underline}** **[territorial
disputes]{.underline}**, he finds that [in times
of]{.underline} **[internal turmoil]{.underline}** **[or regime
insecurity]{.underline}**, [China
seeks]{.underline} **[compromises]{.underline}** with foreign
states, **[rather than confrontation]{.underline}** (Fravel, 2005:47).
Internal or domestic turmoil is referred to as regime insecurity. Fravel
specifically dwells on social discontent, such
as **[protests]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[legitimacy
crises,]{.underline}** and ethnic violence or uprisings. His
observations are that when China is in a state of regime insecurity, the
state [choose]{.underline}s **[not to escalate]{.underline}** any of
the **[territorial
conflicts]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} the [neighbouring
states]{.underline}. [Instead,]{.underline} [China
seeks]{.underline} **[cooperation]{.underline}**, **[contrary]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** what
the **[DWT]{.underline}** predicts. [Instead of diversion,
good]{.underline} [relations]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [foreign
state is]{.underline} **[one key way to]{.underline}** **[solve internal
problems]{.underline}**, in addition to domestic tools. [This
is]{.underline} [connected to the theoretical concept of
Omnibalancing]{.underline} (David, 1991:235), [which
explains]{.underline} [that leaders of third-world countries would be
inclined to cooperate with an adversary, if]{.underline} [there is an
enemy deemed as more threatening.]{.underline} There are several
ways [leaders]{.underline} could [benefit from cooperating with other
states to deal with]{.underline} [regime insecurity:
they]{.underline} can [gain]{.underline} **[direct]{.underline}** **[assistance]{.underline}** in
dealing with the domestic threat, such as an external state denying
rebel groups a harbor, as in Syria harboring Öcalan in our case, or they
can improve border patrols. [They]{.underline} can **[avoid a costly
two-front
war]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[focus]{.underline}** their
resources **[on the domestic issues]{.underline}** [instead of the
defense budget. Cooperation could also lead to an improvement of the
regimes\']{.underline} **[international
recognition]{.underline}**, [which
would]{.underline} **[delegitimize]{.underline}** any **[domestic
contestors]{.underline}** (Fravel, 2005:52). According to Fravel,
leaders have three strategy options in ongoing disputes: they can delay,
i.e. maintain claims to the issue, escalate via threat or use of force,
and finally cooperate by dropping claims or offering concessions
(Fravel, 2005:52). The least costly alternative is the delaying
strategy, whereas escalation is costly due to risk of ending up in a
military defeat, and cooperation is costly since it can be perceived as
weakness by domestic audiences and lead to a removal from office.
However, his argument is that [when facing regime
insecurity,]{.underline} [the cost
of]{.underline} the [cooperation]{.underline} strategy [is]{.underline} **[significantly
lowered]{.underline}**, [since whatever one might lose
on]{.underline} [domestic discontent is]{.underline} **[won
through]{.underline}** the **[assistance]{.underline}** in dealing with
the original threat (Fravel, 2005:53). This
is **[especially]{.underline}** true [if the threat to the regime
emerges in the form of a threat to]{.underline} [territorial integrity,
which would]{.underline} **[drastically
enhance]{.underline}** the **[incentives to offer
concessions]{.underline}** to the neighbouring countries to prevent them
from aiding events such as uprisings (Fravel 2005:53). This has clear
implications for our case. When the armed Kurdish struggle for
independence (i.e. a threat to territorial integrity) escalates, Turkey
would have strong incentives to cooperate with or give concessions to
Syria, an adjacent state that could serve as a base for the rebels.
Fravel mainly studies behavior in territorial issues as the main
independent variable. In this study, I will broaden this framework and
include other contested foreign policy issues as well as long as there
is a bargain situation for the two related states where concessions can
be made. Although he backs his claims by an empirical study, only some
attempt is made by Fravel to theoreticize his findings. He claims it [is
a "**counterintuitive**]{.underline} argument about the effects of
domestic conflict on foreign policy" (Fravel, 2005:49). He does
elaborate on why states would chose to cooperate, but does not offer any
deeper explanation of the intervening variables in action. However, [we
can draw]{.underline} some **[theoretical
conclusions]{.underline}** from Fravel\'s observations and thoughts.
First, we assume that leaders are rational. They would, in times of a
crisis, assess the problem, identify possible courses of action and then
choose the alternative that is most effective. By assuming this, we can
draw the conclusion that leaders do not engage in a new conflict simply
because the conflict is not manageable. The logic of the DWT is that
leaders can control new conflicts -- otherwise they would not be able to
initiate them in order to divert attention. For Fravel, in
contrast, [leaders choose to focus
on]{.underline} **[what]{.underline}** **[they
can]{.underline}** **[control]{.underline}**, [which leads
to]{.underline} **[cooperation rather than war]{.underline}**. Secondly,
we can assume that conflict is
costly. [The]{.underline} [resources]{.underline} [of the state might
be]{.underline} **[too scarce to
manage]{.underline}** **[two]{.underline}** **[crises]{.underline}**. [Therefore,]{.underline} [it
is]{.underline} **[not rational to engage in a new, foreign conflict
before the domestic one is solved.]{.underline}**

The Turkish government is using the Russian invasion of Ukraine to
settle [outstanding
grievances](https://www.reuters.com/world/erdogan-says-nato-should-understand-turkeys-security-sensitivities-2022-05-18/) with
much of NATO. Sweden and Finland were expected to [swiftly join the
alliance](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-says-all-ready-quick-ratification-finnish-swedish-nato-membership-2022-05-15/),
in time for the June summit in Madrid. Instead, Ankara has upended this
coronation. Turkey, which joined NATO during the alliance's [first wave
of
enlargement](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49212.htm) in
1952, seeks to [extract concessions](https://t.co/Sc2SdG6RtD) from
Sweden and Finland on combatting terrorism, extraditing citizens of
Kurdish origin to Turkey, and lifting the arms embargo that much of the
West placed on Turkey following its October 2019 invasion of Syria. The
Turkish protests have underscored how Ankara's narrow security concerns
differ considerably from those of the rest of the NATO alliance,
particularly at a time when the alliance has sought to move beyond the
war in Afghanistan and return to its core mission of deterring Russia.

The topic of Turkey has polarized debate in many Western capitals. [The
debate centers on Ankara's value to the alliance, and whether Turkey's
domestic authoritarianism and functional relationship with Moscow matter
for Western security.]{.underline} For Turkey skeptics, [the
argument](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/world/europe/turkey-nato.html) is
that Ankara has upended Western efforts in Syria, and that its tight
trading relationship with Russia and refusal to join with Western
sanctions to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine suggest that
Turkey undermines NATO security. For proponents, Turkey's large,
conscript-heavy military is seen as vital for tying up Russian forces in
a theoretical conventional conflict, and its [sale of TB2
drones](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/05/16/the-turkish-drone-that-changed-the-nature-of-warfare) to
Ukraine is proof-positive of Ankara's constructive role in NATO and
contribution to [deterring Russian
expansionism](https://twitter.com/yusuferim34/status/1402177441964122114?s=24). 

In these debates,
[Ankara's [sympathizers](https://twitter.com/sinanulgen1/status/1527399508425990145) often
focus on the legitimacy of Turkey's concerns,
while [critics](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-syria-middle-east-recep-tayyip-erdogan-4386d1ae4dd72a1bcf2e26f0710987e6?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP_Europe&utm_campaign=SocialFlow) emphasize
that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is blackmailing the West to win
nationalist votes at home. But both of these arguments miss a deeper
point. Turkish elites are serious about their security concerns and that
in itself is problem for NATO.]{.underline} [These genuine concerns are
not just framed in anti-Western ways, but **understood** in anti-Western
ways. This means that **Ankara has some legitimate demands,**
particularly on collective support for counter-terrorism]{.underline}.
But when pro-Ankara analysts focus solely on these asks, they overlook
the "poison-pill" demands for democratic countries to limit their own
societies' free speech in ways that are impossible, or to extradite
people without proper evidence. Conversely, by dismissing all of
Erdogan's demands as token efforts to rally his base, Western critics
risk downplaying the seriousness with which the ruling Justice and
Development party in Turkey pursues foreign policy.

The Turkish government is using the threat of non-consensus to try to
force a wider change in how NATO conceptualizes security. [This facet of
Turkish foreign policy has broad support inside the country and the
challenge it presents to Turkish-Western relations **will endure long
past the current impasse over NATO expansion**]{.underline}. The sooner
leaders in Washington and Brussels confronts this fact, the more
effectively they will be able to handle the unmanageable problem it
poses.

The Roots of Ankara's Anger

Erdogan is one of the world's most transparent leaders and uses clear,
blunt language to describe his foreign policy goals. [Despite this, his
frequent criticisms of the United States and the international
order [are often dismissed as
bluster](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/05/23/erdogan-turkey-pkk-election-sweden-finland-nato/),
aimed only at a domestic audience to retain populist
support]{.underline}. To be sure, all foreign crises involving Turkey
have some link to domestic politics, [but dismissing Erdogan's rhetoric
as unserious is a mistake. The security concerns that he and his
officials have bluntly laid out over Swedish and Finnish NATO membership
are widely shared inside Turkey and linked to a whole host of other
issues that have plagued Turkish-Western relations for the past
decade]{.underline}. [These include the way Turkish elites [view their
own national security
situation](https://stockholmcf.org/pew-report-72-percent-of-turks-see-us-as-security-threat/),
their expectations of
"[solidarity](https://www.conversationsix.com/profile/5Jaafs3entsc2Zutf)"
from Western allies, and their suspicion --- shared by the majority of
Turks --- that the United States and NATO are [actually
adversaries](https://eurasiantimes.com/us-israel-biggest-threat-to-turkey-azerbaijan-closet-ally-centre-for-turkish-studies/) instead
of allies.]{.underline}

Many varieties of Turkish nationalists hold [hostile anti-NATO
views](https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/leaving-nato-should-be-on-agenda-mhp-leader-174038) and
an even [smaller
subset](https://www.swp-berlin.org/publications/products/research_papers/2022RP07_EurasianismInTurkey.pdf) view
Moscow as a more suitable ally for Turkey than NATO[. Elements of this
clique view Greece as particularly hostile and believe that the threat
from Athens has grown in recent years because of its [closer
relationship](https://greekreporter.com/2022/05/17/live-greek-pm-mitsotakis-address-u-s-congress/) Washington
and the arms embargoes placed on Turkey]{.underline}. The U.S.-Greek
relationship was consolidated, particularly during the Trump
administration, by [Greece's
openness](https://www.defensenews.com/news/your-military/2022/05/12/greece-to-extend-base-access-deal-with-us-military/) to
hosting American military forces. For Turkey's anti-Western
Eurasianists, the increase in American cooperation with Greece is viewed
as proof of [American encirclement](http://www.apple.com/) of Turkey and
indicative of an American policy of weakening the Turkish armed forces.

As a result, many elites view the country's [military balance vis-à-vis
Greece](https://twitter.com/kozanserkan1/status/1526470346567729152?s=24&t=9Su4Zecj6Jc_FA8udKRCpQ) as
paramount for national security. The focus on maintaining a more capable
military than Athens has direct relevance to Turkey's position on
Swedish and Finnish membership in NATO. The American decision, in this
instance, to kick Turkey out of the F-35 program looms large.
Washington's decision came after years of telegraphing to Turkey that
its purchase of the S-400 air defense system from Russia would lead to
Turkey's removal from the fighter production program and result in
sanctions. Ankara ignored these warnings. The end result was [just what
Washington
signaled](https://warontherocks.com/2021/10/not-a-divorce-but-a-defense-decoupling-whats-next-for-the-u-s-turkish-alliance/) and
Ankara lost its future front-line fighter and now faces [sanctions on
its defense
industry.](https://2017-2021.state.gov/caatsa-section-231-imposition-of-sanctions-on-turkish-presidency-of-defense-industries/index.html) Greece,
in turn, has [pledged to purchase the
F-35](https://greekreporter.com/2022/05/17/greece-buy-us-f-35-after-2028/) and,
importantly, [has received
upgrades](https://www.key.aero/article/aegean-vipers-overview-greeces-major-f-16-upgrade) to
its legacy F-16 fleet. Ankara has requested these same aircraft upgrades
from Washington, but an unofficial arms embargo[ Congress has
imposed](https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2020/08/12/congress-has-secretly-blocked-us-arms-sales-to-turkey-for-nearly-two-years/) since
October 2019 has prevented it. The uncertainty about the future of the
Turkish Air Force --- and the upgrades to the Hellenic Air Force --- has
reinforced concerns inside Ankara about the future balance of forces in
the Aegean and Mediterranean regions.

Thus, even though Turkey has decreased its overall reliance on foreign
suppliers for military equipment, its inability to access certain
higher-end equipment does have an impact on the country's armed forces.
The embargoes also reinforce [paranoid
thinking](https://warontherocks.com/2020/06/blue-homeland-the-heated-politics-behind-turkeys-new-maritime-strategy/) about
the true intent in Washington and reinforces the fictitious narrative
that Washington seeks to hinder Turkish development out of some broader
desire to control elites in Ankara. This also bolsters the broadly held
view that the United States is indirectly killing Turkish troops by
supplying weapons to the Syrian Kurds while, at the same time, denying
them to Turkey.

Ankara has never accepted the Syrian Kurds as a legitimate
anti-terrorist force, and instead has said that using ["one terrorist
group to fight
another](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/1/9/erdogan-us-made-a-serious-mistake-on-syrian-kurdish-ypg-fighters)"
is destined to fail. The Syrian Kurds, Ankara has suggested, will
repress Arabs, who will then seek shelter from Islamic State, thereby
creating a cycle of violence that Ankara will always have to grapple
with. As Washington's relationship with the Syrian Kurds deepened, so
too did Ankara's intransigence over the direction of the war against the
Islamic State. This intransigence eventually led to [unilateral Turkish
military
action](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/turkey-invades-syria-turkish-president-erdogan-announces-military-operation-today-2019-10-09/) intended [to
carve out a 30-kilometer buffer
zone](https://warontherocks.com/2014/12/the-origins-of-turkeys-buffer-zone-in-syria/) along
the entirety of the [Turkish border with
Syria](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/world/middleeast/syria-turkey-erdogan-afrin.html).
This zone was intended to keep the Syrian Kurds away from Turkey's
border and, importantly, to serve as a repository for displaced Syrians,
who Ankara has sought to bar from entering the country since 2015.
However, in each instance, Ankara's unilateral actions prompted [Western
counter-reaction](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/10/30/us-turkey-alliance-in-downward-spiral-as-congress-mulls-sanctions/) with
sanctions and embargoes. These twin issues are, now, the cornerstone of
Ankara's push against Finnish and Swedish membership in NATO.

[Turkey is seeking to rectify what it perceives as an injustice by using
its power to deny consensus in NATO and thereby coerce the alliance to
take its own national security issues more seriously]{.underline}**.
[Ankara is]{.underline}** [doing this with blunt force: threatening to
block the accession of two new NATO members, threatening to invade Syria
(again), and [**implicitly
threatening**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/24/erdogan-says-he-will-cut-all-ties-with-greece-dashing-hopes-of-talks) **to [further
escalate](https://www.euronews.com/2022/04/29/greece-and-turkey-accuse-each-other-s-military-of-airspace-violations) tensions
with Greece**]{.underline}. [The challenge is that Turkish demands of
Sweden and Finland are **not some roundabout way to whip up populist
sentiment**, **or** solely **a reflection of Erdogan trying to split the
opposition before the 2023 elections**. Instead, the **Turkish
position** on its security vulnerabilities **is genuine** and the
slow-rolling of NATO enlargement is seen as a legitimate mechanism to
coerce the alliance to take Turkish concerns more
seriously]{.underline}.

The issue, of course, is that these concerns are unique to Ankara and
not shared by the Western alliance. Instead, Ankara's Kurdish problem is
thought of as an internal, Turkish-only issue that can be resolved with
a [return to a peace
process](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/western-europemediterranean/turkey/turkey-and-pkk-saving-peace-process).
Even while NATO members recognize the brutality of the Kurdistan Workers
Party and its terrorist tactics, they see the group as a product of
Turkey's own democratic failings. Meanwhile, within Turkey, the ruling
party has
ample [support](https://www.americanprogress.org/press/release-cap-poll-shows-deep-ambivalence-turkey-toward-european-union/) for
its hardline policies, even if there are gripes within the country about
how Erdogan conducts foreign policy. The disconnect between Turkey and
its NATO allies may grow in the coming years, given divergences over
national security priorities and Ankara's willingness to use its
position within Western institutions to coerce its allies.

[The Turkish positions over Sweden and Finland are not spur of the
moment, nor are they simply reflective of populist domestic politics.
Instead, what Ankara is seeking to do is to "right" perceived wrongs
that are now nearly a decade old. The challenges in meeting Ankara's
demands are manifest, signaling that even if there is compromise over
this one issue, differences between Turkey and the NATO alliance will
persist]{.underline}. These suggest that managing Turkey will remain a
core issue for NATO for years to come, underscoring how current
challenges may continue to fester even if compromises can be found.

[The best pathway forward for the United States and Europe is to admit
that relations with Ankara are a transactional, interest-driven affair
that requires near-constant effort to manage]{.underline}. Given
Turkey's position within NATO, it literally gets a vote over expansion,
ensuring that Ankara can extract concessions from current and future
aspirants. However, it would be unwise for countries to focus only on
the Turkish demands that it agrees with, without viewing the totality of
Ankara's expectations. [Ankara may be forced to capitulate, but
Erdogan's earnestness when expressing his desires for [global
change](https://www.insightturkey.com/articles/the-world-is-bigger-than-five-a-salutary-manifesto-of-turkeys-new-international-outlook) clearly
indicate that he **will revisit his gripes at a later
date**]{.underline}**,** [when he again feels he has leverage over the
West]{.underline}. This reality should also inform how the West deals
with Turkey: looking for its own opportunities to extract concessions
when it is Ankara that is vulnerable to coercion. This method of
diplomacy is, at its core, how the current leadership in Turkey views
its relations with the world --- as a zero-sum affair. It would behoove
others to get with the program. [It is unclear if Turkish demands of
Sweden and Finland can ever be met, but the demands are serious and part
of a broader worldview that informs Turkey's thinking. It would be wise
to understand the roots of those concerns because, inevitably, **they
will reappear**]{.underline}.

#### Greece concerns existed before Erdogan, and will persist past him

JHK

[**Turkey's rejection of NATO accession for Sweden and Finland,** beyond
undercutting NATO's response to Russia's aggression, **reflects a deeper
rift between the West and Turkey**.]{.underline} This is further
manifest by Ankara's recent threat to expand into northern Syria and its
overflights of Greek territory. [For the sake of the Alliance, immediate
responses are vital, but **the rift will worsen unless Washington and
European capitals work** with Ankara **to fundamentally shift their
relationship**.]{.underline} While such a shift has long been advisable
given Turkey's importance, the existential threat of Russian aggression
for both Turkey and the Alliance make it urgent.

Almost overnight Ankara lashed out against Finland and Sweden,
threatening to block their NATO accession if they did not cut real and
alleged ties to the PKK.

A month ago, Washington hosted Turkish Foreign Minister Melvut Cavusoglu
and signaled a new bilateral strategic dialogue. This included possible
sales of F-16's to Ankara, symbolically ending the bitter dispute over a
Turkish Russian missile purchase, and Washington's subsequent cutting
Turkey from the F-35 program. Turkey was also following analogous
rapprochement with Arab states, Israel, Greece, and Armenia, and now
plays a central role in the Ukrainian conflict providing weapons,
closing the Straits to Russian naval reinforcements and pressing on
various diplomatic exchanges. Then almost overnight Ankara lashed out
against Finland and Sweden, threatening to block their NATO accession if
they did not cut real and alleged ties to the PKK, and followed up with
the aforementioned threats in Syria and escalation in the Aegean.
Predictably, American commentators reacted vigorously, even suggesting
once again for Turkey to be thrown out of NATO.

Shifting attitudes toward Turkey

[Such dramatic flips in Turkish policy, gelding any predictable
diplomacy, have become a hallmark of both Turkish president Erdogan and
the convoluted internal political system with his party, dependent on an
extremist nationalist partner. Such flips also make efforts to resolve
issues such as those above (let alone the underlying rift between Ankara
and NATO allies), a high-risk endeavor which most Western leaders avoid,
writing Turkey off as a lost cause. But as Ukraine has demonstrated,
Turkey is vital to containing Russia, as it has been to NATO's nuclear
deterrence, missile defense against Iran, operations in the Balkans, and
Afghanistan. It is just too big, too important, and at times too
problematic to ignore.]{.underline}

While the Ukraine conflict is now generating strife between Turkey and
NATO over Scandinavian accession, it also offers a chance to improve
relations between them. That conflict resembles nothing seen since the
late 1930s and immediate post-war period, with the very survival of the
world order at stake. Winning this conflict, by maintaining Ukraine's
survival as an independent state and deterring new Russian aggression,
while avoiding escalation into the unknown, is a categorical imperative
not experienced since the Cold War. While this is true of the Alliance
as a whole, it is especially relevant for Turkey, a front line state
with a long history under Russian pressure.

[Furthermore, experience shows Turkey can be cooperative.]{.underline}
The Bush administration worked well with Turkey on counter-PKK
operations, and the Obama administration negotiated a NATO anti- Iranian
ballistic missile radar deployment. The 2019 Pence-Erdogan ceasefire in
Northeast Syria still holds despite Turkish threats, and the two
capitals handled well President Biden's acknowledgment of Armenian
genocide. And, ironically, despite deep geostrategic hostility and
recent military clashes, Russia and Turkey maintain productive
presidential-level relations, with Putin and especially Erdogan usually
following a 'no-surprises' principle.

The Turks understand that accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO is
critically important for a positive Ukraine outcome.

The Turks understand that accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO is
critically important for a positive Ukraine outcome. They know it would
strengthen the West's long-term against Russian aggression and underline
the solidarity of the international front against Moscow, without, as
Putin admitted, directly threatening Russia. [But what Ankara may not
get is that its penchant for dangerous haggling, not only over accession
but with its Aegean and northern Syria threats, undercuts that
solidarity and the whole Russia containment categorical imperative.
Turkey would then be blamed and likely ostracized permanently within
NATO. So, the question is, why does it keep running such
risks?]{.underline}

Turkey's risks

Beyond the specific difficulties with President Erdogan and his domestic
political and economic woes, underlying issues stymie cooperation;
although they could be managed if understood better. [**Most immediate
are Turkey's concerns about its 'near abroad' security issues in the
Caucasus, Iraq, Syria, the Aegean, and** Eastern **Mediterranean**
abutting Turkey's access to the world. Above all, Turkey sees the
Kurdish PKK insurgency as an existential threat.]{.underline} While its
terrorism in Turkey has been largely suppressed, it has large bases in
Iraq and Syria, including the PKK offshoot YPG commanding the Syrian
Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeast Syria fighting with US and other
Western support against ISIS.

Turkey understands but cannot politically accept this support to the
SDF, as Ankara fears one day the Americans will leave, and the SDF will
turn on Turkey. [Likewise **it sees Greece asserting legally unjustified
positions in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean as choking off Turkish
access to undersea riches and** eventually even international **air and
sea communications.**]{.underline} Finally it views Armenia as a
hindrance to its alliance with Azerbaijan, with important energy and
security benefits and linguistic and ethnic ties.

Making everything worse, Turks, drawing on their 19thcentury great power
experiences, fear that powerful real or potential foes will exploit
these near abroad dangers. They point here not only to Russian support
to Armenia but Iranian collaboration with PKK elements in Iraq and
Syria. They also see US and other Western, notably French, military
arrangements with Athens as aimed at them, citing Washington's and
Paris's criticism of Turkey's actions while ignoring Greek sins (its
troops on Aegean islands demilitarized in various treaties, illegitimate
air space claims, and Law of the Sea provisions imposed on non-signatory
Turkey).

[These near **abroad security issues predate Erdogan and are hard-wired
into Turkish foreign policy** and popular sentiment, but because of the
often irritating way Ankara presents even reasonable arguments,
Washington and European capitals dismiss or belittle them]{.underline}.

This problem is compounded by Washington's difficulties, understanding
that if it wants states to support its global security agenda against
Russia or China, it has to take those states' immediate security
concerns seriously. This includes not just Turkey but, for example,
Saudi Arabia and the UAE with Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen.
Furthermore, Turkey's near abroad opponents, the PKK movement, Greece,
and Armenia, have strong diaspora lobbies in the US and Western Europe
who effectively portray Turkey as an eternal enemy regardless of
Ankara's policies, even those which at times accommodated Kurdish,
Greek, and Armenian interests.

[Compromise, horse trading, and just saying no, staples of most
diplomacy, are often seen on all sides as betrayals of NATO solidarity,
Western values, and past contributions and sacrifices.]{.underline}

Finally, achieving productive, transactional deals between Ankara and
the rest of the West, such as those cited above, is undercut by "band of
brothers" thinking in all the relevant capitals. Compromise, horse
trading, and just saying no, staples of most diplomacy, are often seen
on all sides as betrayals of NATO solidarity, Western values, and past
contributions and sacrifices. Most bilateral meetings with Ankara begin
with long-winded recitation of what the other is doing wrong, with a
naïve expectation that the other, if harangued enough, will stop doing
things truly important to it, such as Ankara's maintaining a complex
relationship with Russia or Washington's fighting ISIS with whatever
partner works.

A new course

The first step out of this dilemma is for all sides to recognize that
with Russian aggression, they face a unique international situation that
requires subordination of all other priorities to the core objective.
That sort of wisdom, familiar to Churchill, Roosevelt, Truman, military
planners, and in a perverse way, Putin, has largely faded in the West
since 1989, replaced by what has become conventional foreign policy
thinking: nothing is critical and innumerable factors compete for
consideration, for example moral, ideological, humanitarian, domestic,
security, alliance, economic, personal, or usually some triangulation of
them.

Both sides must prioritize vigorously containing Russia, seek
transactional deals on those issues between them that can be resolved,
and ignore the others.

In the impasse between Turkey and NATO, this conventional thinking
encourages states, buffeted by various interests and negative voices
towards Turkey, to treat it as a second class, suspect member of the
alliance, while benefiting from its extraordinary NATO contributions.
But conventional thinking also pushes Ankara, with its domestic
pressures, to see the Ukrainian crisis as simply another opportunity to
extort Europe over Turkey's second-class status, EU accession, arms
sales, and specific issues such as the PKK and the Aegean. Both sides
thus must prioritize vigorously containing Russia, seek transactional
deals on those issues between them that can be resolved, and ignore the
others. In short, accepting partners as they are, not as they should be.

The immediate challenge is NATO accession. Here Turkey has to blink
first and recognize that the stakes, not just stopping Russia but
preserving its own relations with NATO, require accepting half a loaf
(not always an Erdogan government trait). It cannot expect Sweden and
Finland to extradite people to a state whose legal system is under
continuous international criticism, nor for those countries to silence
freedom of expression, even when it is sympathetic to the terrorist PKK
cause. It should also be accepted that, while the fight against the PKK
is truly important to Turkish security, it is still secondary to Russia
advancing on its borders.

In return, Sweden should lift its ban on arms sales to Turkey (and the
US Congress the same with its informal ban, now impacting the F-16
sale). Finland and especially Sweden, given their long affinity for
"national liberation" movements, should cut official contacts with the
PKK and its fronts, recommit to Helsinki Final Act on noninterference in
others' internal affairs and give assurances they would cooperate in
NATO on issues important to Turkey.

Turkey's partners should continue counseling it against a new incursion
into northern Syria. But if Turkey compromises by only attacking PKK
elements west of the Euphrates, away from US forces and the main
anti-ISIS effort, Washington's objections should be muted. Likewise,
partners should urge Turkey to stop overflying Greek territory, but
simultaneously speak out on provocative Greek policies.

While these steps can manage the immediate crises Turkey has launched,
the longer-term solution, moving to a transactional relationship, needs
highest level US leadership. First, such a relationship requires dealing
with Erdogan; if Putin can do it with a geostrategic opponent, why
cannot American and European leaders with an ally, however difficult,
given the stakes. Second, the US needs someone at a very senior level to
complement the American ambassador as the administration's Turkish file
lead, not to communicate with the Turks but to corral the undisciplined
official and unofficial Washington policy worlds. That world can torpedo
any foreign policy effort, but doing so regarding Turkey is child's play
in the absence of presidential engagement and a Washington champion.

None of that will make a difference, however, unless Turkey's leadership
recognizes it must change some policies and, more so, attitudes toward
its NATO allies, whom at this point are all Turkey can count on faced
with an existential threat from Russia.

Although Greece and Turkey escalated their crisis behaviour, crisis
escalation was actu-

ally inhibited at lower levels by NATO and the EU. The empirical
evidence from the

Greek--Turkish crises demonstrates that the presence of regional
organizations which

cover states in a conflictual relationship is conducive to inhibiting a
higher escalation of

interstate crises or the use of force/war for two reasons. First, for
the most part, the EU

and NATO contributed to mitigating the Greek--Turkish crises through
socialization and

third-party mediation (Tsakonas, 2010). Mitchell and Hensel (2007: 724)
argue that

third-party intervention by regional organizations can reduce the
security dilemma by

providing conflictual dyads with assurances that long-term cooperation
will benefit their

national interests. Specifically, the incentives and disincentives of
the EU/EC discour-

aged Greece and Turkey from going to war. Neither side, nor their
leaderships, could

play the nationalist card to such an extent as to harm relations with
the EU/EC. Greece

was in a vulnerable position within the Union because of its endemic
economic crises,

while Turkey was anxious to make progress in its EU/EC membership
(Loizides, 2002;

Rumelili, 2003: 223). While Mitchell (2006: 26 f.) demonstrates that
joint regional

organization membership increases the probability of militarizing
disputes, this is only

partly true for Greece and Turkey, since the two countries reached the
brink of war in

multiple crises but never fought one in the past few decades, unlike
other conflictual

dyads.

One possible explanation for the low intensity of the Greek--Turkish
conflict is

Greece's refusal to endorse Turkey's EU accession unless the latter
ceased its occupation

of Cyprus and resolved the Aegean issue. Although, at times, Turkey
considered a com-

promise, it opted to escalate conflict, putting pressure on Greece and
the EU. However,

it never caused confrontation to such an extent as to irreversibly
terminate its EU ambi-

tions. Likewise, Greece's limited confrontational attitude has derived
from its precarious

position within the EU, aiming for negotiation gains but minimizing the
possibility of

major Turkish or EU reprisals. In other words, in the case of the
Greek--Turkish dyad, EU

accession dynamics led to low levels of conflict instead of conflict
resolution between

the two countries.

The Greek--Turkish crises provide insights for a discussion on
international institu-

tions between neo-realism and liberal institutionalism. Mearsheimer
(1994/1995, 1995)

argues that international institutions do not prevent states from going
to war. They do not

independently affect state behaviours and are the outcome of state
behaviours based on

self-interested calculations. Based on this assumption, Mearsheimer
argues that interna-

tional institutions do not cause peace. Taking the opposite point of
view, namely, liberal

institutionalism, Keohane and Martin (1995) and Wallander et al. (1999)
argue that inter-

national institutions affect the calculation of national interest and
promote reciprocal

cooperation between states, and are therefore an element of a lasting
peace.

In the case of the Greek--Turkish crises, liberal institutionalism seems
to reflect crisis

behaviour better than neo-realism. Although Mearsheimer (1995: 87)
argues that empiri-

cal evidence does not support the institutionalist argument that
institutions can cause

peace, the empirical evidence of this article demonstrates that regional
organizations can

prevent high levels of escalation even in the presence of acute security
dilemmas and

diversionary environments. More specifically, two regional
organizations, the EU and

NATO, contributed to mitigating -- although they admittedly did not
completely eradi-

cate -- Greek--Turkish crises. Thus, for our cases, Mearsheimer
underestimates the role of

international institutions in limiting escalations by overlooking the
mediating role and

values of regional organizations.

Nor does liberal institutionalism fully explain relations between
conflict and interna-

tional institutions, because, as Krebs (1999) and Rumelili (2003)
demonstrate in the

32 Cooperation and Conﬂict 46(1)

Greek--Turkish conflict, regional organizations sometimes have negative
influences on

conflict rather than promoting cooperation. In the more recent
literature, liberal institu-

tionalists appear to admit this point (e.g. see Wallander and Keohane
1999: 42 f.).

Nevertheless, it can be argued that liberal institutionalism explains
the role of regional

organizations in recent interstate crises more precisely than
neo-realism, because the

former expects that international institutions can cause peace through
security manage-

ment roles (Wallander and Keohane, 1999), whereas the latter does not.
In fact, both

Krebs (1999: 369) and Rumelili (2003: 217) admit that the negative
influences of the EU

and NATO do not mean that the Greek--Turkish conflict would have been
more easily

mitigated if these regional organizations had not been involved. The
validity of their

argument becomes evident if one considers the gradual improvement in
Greek--Turkish

relations in the past decade, especially following the 1999 earthquakes,
and if one com-

pares Greece--Turkey with parts of the globe lacking cross-country
regional institutions,

such as the Indian subcontinent

This article introduced the theory of diversionary peace, which improves
our understanding of the link between foreign policy making and
contentious civil-military relations. [[Contributing to peace abroad can
have coup proofing effects at home]{.mark} quite like the decision to go
to war. A thick description of [Tunisia served as an empirical]{.mark}
plausibility [probe]{.mark} of the mechanisms [linking peacekeeping to
coup-proofing]{.mark}. Participation in [peacekeeping establishes
feasibility obstacles for]{.mark} coup [coordination]{.mark}, the
[allocation of]{.mark} economic [resources to officers]{.mark}, the
[institutionalization of the]{.mark} military [apparatus]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} a [professionalized ethos in the officer
corps]{.mark}]{.underline}. In an emerging research programme on the
interplay of peacekeeping and domestic politics, studying Tunisia
reveals three novel findings. First, coup-proofing can be the unintended
outcome of dynamics in civil-military relations where political
incumbents did not design specific strategies to keep officers in the
barracks[. In Tunisia, it was the military leadership pushing for
peacekeeping participation more so than the Ben Ali regime. Second, the
[Tunisian case reveals]{.mark} that coup-proofing through [peacekeeping
is]{.mark} particularly [effective]{.mark}]{.underline} in countries
with small armies, where battalion strength mission participation
immediately introduces a high percentage of officers into a career
trajectory contributing to individual and collective
professionalization. It is in larger armies, with larger officer corps,
where military 96Author interview with Tunisian journalist, Tunis, 17
May 2017. 608 H. ALBRECHT leaderships and political incumbents remain
more selective on mission participants. Greater competition creates
winners and losers for the perks of peacekeeping and hence individual
grievances among those officers deprived of opportunities at
professional advancement. Third, and relatedly, Tunisia shows which
mechanisms prove particularly effective in advancing coup proofing.
While peacekeeping contributes to institutional professionalization and
the development of a professional ethos, these remain slow-moving facets
of a military's social fabric. Other dynamics and events, such as
international support for military training, the effect of economic
development on recruitment and procurement, and a military's deployment
in domestic or external conflicts certainly have an impact on military
professionalism as well, perhaps at a higher degree than the provision
or troops for international peacekeeping. Rather than such corporate
factors, it is the individual-level mechanisms highlighted in this
article -- feasibility obstacles and the provision of material resources
-- where peacekeeping generates the most significant impact on
coup-proofing. [[These findings have important]{.mark}

beyond. Peacekeeping participation has so far not been fully addressed
as an important element of the Tunisian military's engagement and helps
us better understand why, for instance, the military returned to the
barracks in 2011, that is, at a point in time where it could have
assumed power through the post-Arab Spring transition period. [[Scholars
interested]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the theory and empirical practice of
[diversionary war may consider a limitation to the theory's
applicability]{.mark}]{.underline} for weak armies. [While [war may not
always be an option]{.mark}, contributing to [peace]{.mark} can be
[equally attractive for]{.mark} its positive effects on
[civil]{.mark}-military [relations]{.mark}. In turn, the theory of
[diversionary peace]{.mark} offers a contribution to the research
programme on international peacekeeping in that it [proposes novel ideas
about the rationale for]{.mark} troop [commitments]{.mark} beyond
geostrategic considerations]{.underline}. Further research will be
necessary to explore the external validity of the findings from the
Tunisian case. [The broader [applicability of]{.mark} the [diversionary
peace]{.mark} appears to be [particularly promising]{.mark} for
civil-military relations during democratic transitions]{.underline},
such as in Latin America, and the post-conflict environments of small
states in sub-Sahara Africa. In fact, initial observations appear to
reveal the explanatory power of the diversionary peace in multiple cases
including Ghana, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, and
Senegal. While the diversionary peace should be seen as an important
component in the toolbox of foreign policy making, it remains a
medium-range theory with its explanatory power subject to important
context factors. [For one, the [theory works well
for]{.mark}]{.underline} small armies in [[authoritarian regimes]{.mark}
[that]{.mark}, [at]{.mark} the [time of]{.mark} increased [coup
threat]{.mark}, [would entertain opportunities for]{.mark} participation
in [peace]{.mark}keeping [missions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps more
importantly, participation in peacekeeping missions is not a
coup-proofing strategy equally available to authoritarian incumbents
across time and space. The very existence of a peacekeeping mission
along with the mission sponsor's invitation to participate come as
necessary conditions for incumbents to consider sending troops abroad.
These constraints ultimately limit the applicability of diversionary
peace to post-Cold War international politics for the dramatic increase
in peacekeeping missions after 1990. [Yet, since the number of
interstate wars has declined quite considerably during that same period,
[diversionary war becomes less likely and diversionary peace merits
greater attention]{.mark} in contemporary international
politics]{.underline}

#### **Turkey prioritizes cooperation with great powers and defense, no risk of attack**

In the same era, [[Turkey]{.mark} followed "a passive strategy of
renunciation" and [stayed]{.mark} in the [nonrevisionist]{.mark}
camp]{.underline}.59 Turkey increased its defense expenditures (see
Table 2) but its [[defenses were]{.mark} still [only effective for
limited regional warfare]{.mark}. Turkey could not face a major threat,
such as the Italian or German Air Force]{.underline}.60 Ankara remained
passive in the hope that the threat would disappear. [Turkey also used
international regimes]{.underline}, particularly when the revision of
the Lausanne Straits Convention started with Turkey's [application to
the League of Nations in April 1936.]{.underline} During the [process,
Turkey had pro-status quo tendencies carried out via multilateral
diplomacy and international law]{.underline}.61 It managed to win the
support of greater powers, i.e. Britain, to reshape other parties'
demands. Turkey invoked the rebus sic stantibus principle to terminate
the Straits Convention.62 With these maneuvers, Turkey, through the
Montreux Convention (1936), managed to offset Russia, and to achieve
control over the Bosporus and the Dardanelles as regulatory authority on
the transit of naval warships. Turkey then started shifting between
varying alliance structures against Italian expansionism in the Eastern
Mediterranean, which increased its value as a counterweight between
antagonistic alliances.63 Against Italian armaments in the Dodecanese
islands and Mussolini's Mare Nostrum rhetoric, [[Turkey successfully
cooperated with the British within the League]{.mark} to impose
sanctions on Italy after the invasion of Abyssinia and the signing of
the Balkan Entente of 1934.]{.underline} Once the Abyssinia Crisis
cooled down, Italy tried to reharmonize relations with Turkey by
revoking its claims over Turkish lands.64 [In its relations with the
Soviets, [Ankara]{.mark} glossed over its anticommunist tendencies65 to
[test the opportunities for economic and security
partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moscow contributed 8 million USD
towards Turkey's first five-year economic development plan after the
Great Depression of 1929.66 [Turkey, with Russia, [proclaimed its
opposition to Western dominance]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
international economy [but at the same time [became a League
member]{.mark}]{.underline}, which it considered to be of Western
design.67 Turkey also rejected Stalin's quest for security against
Hitler via the joint Turkish-Soviet defense system on the Straits.68
Turkey managed to accomplish these relations while maintaining the
framework of neutrality. In the 1930s, [Ank[ara made a special effort to
not be on either side of the polarizing international system, but did
not completely detach itself either]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Turkey did not conclude agreements with any one side, which could
potentially have restricted its revenues from the other. Two clear
examples were Ankara's rejection of Stalin's offer for a joint defense
system of the Turkish straits against Germany and its non-conclusion of
an agreement with the Germans for chrome, which could cut down on sales
to the Allies.

### No Impact - No Nukes

During the Cold War and until 2001, Greece hosted US nuclear weapons on
its territory, as part of a NATO nuclear-sharing agreement. Yet, recent
geopolitical developments - the US's progressive military disengagement
from the Middle East, its \"pivot to Asia\", debate around removing
nuclear weapons from Turkey - highlight Greece's potential to become a
nuclear base again. Greece is sold to the idea of greater European
strategic autonomy and is not suspicious of France, unlike other member
states. However, Athen's lack of reaction following French President
Emmanuel Macron's February 2020 speech is due to the country's other
internal priorities and its commitment to NATO as the only actor capable
of offering nuclear deterrence at the moment. In this fifth episode of
our series Weapons of Mass Debate, Yvonni Efstathiou, Programme
Coordinator and Research Analyst for Defense and Military Analysis at
IISS, and Bill Kappis, Lecturer at the Centre for Security and
Intelligence Studies in the University of Buckingham, analyze Greece's
position on the future of European security.

[There is hardly any evidence of a debate concerning nuclear weapons
within the Greek military and political apparatus, mainly due to
concerns regarding the sensitivity of the issue in international
affairs, but also due to the political cost associated with the topic.
Despite the fact that from 1978 to 2001, the Hellenic Airforce Araxos
Air Base hosted the NATO 345 Air Munitions Company under the NATO
nuclear sharing arrangements, **the Greeks are sceptical about nuclear
deployments**]{.underline}, with most critics, unsurprisingly, hailing
from the left of the political spectrum. 

In any case, the fact remains that Greece has been one of just seven
nations to have hosted US nuclear bombs on their territory, as part of
NATO nuclear-sharing agreements. [Yet, the **country's decision not to
retain its nuclear strike capability** by scrapping its A-7E warplanes,
meant that Athens **curtailed its capacity to participate in the US
nuclear deployment programme**. This reportedly resulted in the
withdrawal of 20 US thermonuclear gravity bombs (B61) in 2001, following
years of discussions around the subject. Nevertheless, **Greece
continues to support the Alliance's nuclear deterrence doctrine**, as
indicated by the country's endorsement of relevant Alliance
statements.]{.underline}

Recent geopolitical developments suggest there should be a renewed
interest in bolstering conventional and nuclear deterrence within NATO
and, more specifically, within the European operational theatre. The
reduction of US troop numbers in the continent has continued unabated
since the first steps of American disengagement from Europe and the
Middle East, during the Obama administration. The so-called US \"pivot
to Asia,\" meanwhile, suggests that future American deployments will be
aimed at bolstering power projection in the Asia-Pacific, bearing an
adverse impact on the only superpower's capacity to face concurrent
security crises across the globe. This major geopolitical shift will
undoubtedly \"test\" the credibility of American deterrence in Europe.
Extended deterrence (preventing an armed attack against another allied
state or group of states) is, in theory, much more demanding to maintain
in a credible manner, as the deterrer should, in principle, be perceived
as both capable and willing to deliver an appropriate response to the
perceived challenger. Providing a robust extended deterrence umbrella to
both European and Asia-Pacific allies is conceivable for the US, but far
from straightforward, even for the sole superpower.

The need for a renewed debate becomes all the more important as the
demise of the INF treaty could further weaken Europe's nuclear
deterrence, as the INF was heavily geared towards intra-European
strategic stability. The advent, moreover, of hypersonic missiles and
their potential introduction into the European nuclear strategic
landscape opens the door to additional pressures on the perceived
credibility of the continent's nuclear deterrence. Finally, the Russian
and Iranian nuclear programmes, as well as the nuclear aspirations of
other regional powers in Europe's vicinity, (i.e. Turkey) should
mobilize Europe and thereby Greece to revisit and reflect upon this
policy domain. Taking into consideration Greece's desire for a
strategically autonomous Europe, Athens should be, at least in theory,
in favour of a renewed debate around nuclear weapons both as part of
NATO burden-sharing arrangements and as a proponent of French deterrent
capabilities within the EU.

### No Impact -- Its all staged

#### The conflict is all staged for domestic political purposes

[The most recent war of words may have domestic political
purposes]{.underline}

One hundred summers ago, the forces of the Turkish National Movement,
led by the charismatic and confident Mustafa Kemal, had turned the tide
and begun pushing the invading Greeks further and further west, with
nowhere to go but into the sea.

Just a year prior, Greek military leaders had felt so confident
advancing into the Anatolian heartland that they reportedly invited
their British allies to a victory dinner in Kemal's new Turkish capital,
Ankara. But the Turks halted that advance at the brutal, game-changing
Battle of Sarkaya, some 50 kilometres west of Ankara, and reversed the
momentum.

In March 1922, the Allies, led by France, the UK, Italy and the US,
suggested the two sides meet for an armistice. But, not unlike Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky in recent weeks, ignoring western advice to
hand land to Russia, Kemal instead hoped to push the invaders fully out
of his territory.

To that end, Turkish forces launched what came to be known as the Great
Offensive in late August and quickly took Afyonkarahisar and Dumlupinar.
On September 1, Kemal famously urged his charges: "Your first goal is
the Mediterranean. Forward!"

They reached their destination in a matter of days, a humbling defeat
for the Greeks and a canonical victory for Kemal, who would sign the
Treaty of Lausanne the next year, found the Republic of Turkey and later
be dubbed "Ataturk", or Father of the Turks.

[This region-shaping moment came to mind last week when Turkish
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, amid fast-rising Greco-Turkish tensions,
delivered a rare tweet stream in Greek, advising Athens to mind its
manners in the Aegean. "We warn once again Greece to be prudent, to stay
away from dreams, rhetoric and actions that will lead to results it will
regret, as happened a century ago," he tweeted]{.underline}.

Three decades of relative amity followed the war and the 1923 population
exchange, but the two neighbours and rivals [have been at each other's
throats](https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/comment/2021/09/20/why-turkey-and-greece-are-at-it-again/) ever
since: Turkish pogroms in 1955, Turkey's [invasion of
Cyprus](https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/comment/is-a-two-state-cyprus-a-real-possibility-1.1206048) in
1974 and the island's ensuing division; banging the drums of war in
1987, 1996 and 2020.

Over the past year, a series of talks hinted at a thaw, until Greek
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis visited Washington in late May,
finalised a deal for F-35 fighter jets and urged the US Congress not to
send military hardware, presumably F-16s, to Turkey. "He no longer
exists for me," Mr Erdogan said of Mr Mitsotakis in response. "I will
never agree to meet with him."

Greece came back with a dismissive comment and, as per the routine, the
tensions soon escalated to include maritime border disagreements in the
Mediterranean, Aegean island militarisation and violations of airspace.

Last week, [after Ankara hinted that the sovereignty of certain Greek
islands in the Aegean might come under question, Athens [sent letters to
the
UN](https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/europe/2022/05/27/turkey-told-to-stop-questioning-greeces-sovereignty-in-letter-to-un/) outlining
its complaints and the US urged the Nato allies to resolve their
disputes through diplomacy]{.underline}. High drama, yet also a bit of a
broken record.

Amid the greatest hits, the longtime Turkish leader's reference to what
happened a century ago stands out. Setting aside the obvious point --
Greece's humbling -- that Turkish victory still today represents a
defeat of western imperialism.

Greek forces had captured a great swathe of Anatolia stretching from
Izmir to Bursa and Eskisehir, while the Allies had taken control of the
Mediterranean jewel of Antalya and the grand prize, Istanbul, as well as
Canakkale -- ensuring full control of the Turkish straits. Not since
Fatih Sultan Mehmet II trotted into Constantinople on his white horse in
May 1453 had Turks felt so vulnerable.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during their meeting in Istanbul in
March. AP Photo

Mr Erdogan's reference signalled that Turks today might feel similarly
hemmed in by its supposed western allies: when Greece places troops on
Aegean islands (though there's little evidence of this); when the EU
restricts Turkey's maritime boundaries or access to Cypriot energy
reserves; when the US partners with Turkey's foes in northern Syria and
opposes Ankara's Syria policy.

The ruling AKP has in recent weeks received its lowest-ever polling
numbers, just a year out from a national vote, and Turkish warnings of
aggression against Greece are an assertion of nationalist might that is
largely meant for a domestic audience.

Of course, it's not all for show. Ryan Gingeras, a top Turkish historian
and national security professor at the California-based Naval
Postgraduate School, wrote last week that, in light of Russia's invasion
of Ukraine, a new Greco-Turkish war "​​is not only possible but perhaps,
at some point, probable\".

**[Yet at least for now, these standoffs almost appear staged. As each
side, and each country's opposition, takes political advantage of the
moment, one can almost envision back-channel diplomats sending each
other quiet thumbs up about the ramped-up rhetoric.]{.underline}**

As with Ankara's looming [incursion into northern
Syria](https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/comment/2022/05/31/can-turkey-still-make-military-gains-without-alienating-its-new-friends/) to
take on Kurdish militants, a bit of rhetorical sparring with Greece
underscores Turkey's military's confidence while also sticking it to the
"imperialist" West. Domestically, that's a win-win.

[Going to war with Greece, on the other hand, would be disastrous for
Turkey, Greece, the US and Nato -- not to mention the Nato-backed war
effort in Ukraine]{.underline}. But as recent history has shown, that it
is an exercise in futility doesn't mean it won't happen.
