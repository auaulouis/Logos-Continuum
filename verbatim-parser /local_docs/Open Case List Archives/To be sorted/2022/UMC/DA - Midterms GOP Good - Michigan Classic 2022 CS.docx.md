# Midterms DA -- GOP Good

#### Notes:

This is the exact opposite of original Midterms file, so many of the aff
cards from that file can be used for the neg side with this file.

This version of the DA is definitely better for winning uniqueness (GOP
likely wins now) and the links aren't bad. This version also gives you
the opportunity to read a hilarious (but maybe true) link argument about
disinformation being key to a Republican victory.

The same issues regarding link uniqueness and thumpers plague both DAs.

There are two 1NC impact scenarios to choose from. "Gridlock" can be
strategic to insulate yourself from turns, but you'd also have the
option to read extra economy internals for why the GOP is good for
growth. The other impact is "Energy Independence" which has some built
in answers to the inevitable "Republicans bad for climate change" turn.

Regardless of which version you read (Dems Good or GOP Good), you should
be prepared to answer a slew of impact turns.

Sincerely,

Classic CS

### 1NC -- Top 

#### a. Uniqueness: Republicans win in the midterms now, but it's close -- polls and Biden disapproval are predictive. 

**Roche, 7/7** (Darragh Roche is a US politics news reporter that works
for Newsweek and has worked for many local, national, and international
publications. "Democrats' worst case scenario for the midterms,"

[[**Democrats** are widely expected to suffer defeats in the]{.mark}
upcoming 2022 [midterm]{.mark} elections, with Republicans aiming to
retake the House of Representatives and the Senate. [The serving]{.mark}
president\'s [party usually performs poorly]{.mark} during midterms and
while [it seems likely]{.mark} President Joe **[Biden will see]{.mark}
major [losses]{.mark}** this November,]{.underline} it\'s not clear just
how bad things will be for the Democrats. [[**Polls** suggest the
Democrats]{.mark} are on course for disappointment and that the party
[could potentially **lose control** of both chambers]{.mark} of
Congress]{.underline} and see newly empowered Republican majorities
stymying Biden\'s agenda in the run up to the next presidential
election. A GOP gain in either chamber would hamstring the Biden
administration, but the worst case scenario would see comfortable
Republican majorities in both chambers, potentially leading to a slew of
investigations and possibly even impeachment of the president. Poll
tracker FiveThirtyEight\'s 2022 election forecast rates the Senate as a
toss up with 35 seats up for re-election. Fourteen are currently held by
Democrats and 21 by Republicans. [[FiveThirtyEight gives Republicans an
**80 percent** chance]{.mark} of holding between 47 and 54 seats. If
that latter figure is reached, it would represent a **major defeat for
Biden\'s party**]{.underline}. The Senate is currently divided between
50 Republicans, 48 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the
Democrats. Vice President Kamala Harris has had to use her casting vote
on a number of occasions and a single Democratic loss in the midterms
would hand control to the Republicans. FiveThirtyEight rates the Senate
races in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania as toss-ups. If
Republicans can win all four, it would be a major loss for the
Democrats. Three of those seats are held by incumbent Democrats, while
Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania is retiring. However,
it\'s highly unlikely that Republicans could gain enough seats in
November to secure a 60-vote, filibuster proof majority. This means
[Democrats are likely to deploy the filibuster if the GOP retakes the
chamber]{.underline}. Nonetheless, a Republican-led Senate could hold up
Biden\'s judicial nominees and potentially prevent him filling any
vacant seats that might arise on the U.S. Supreme Court, as Senate
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell did in 2016 when he was majority leader.
[Republicans are favored to win the House, according to
FiveThirtyEight,]{.underline} while Democrats currently hold 220 seats
to Republicans\' 210, with five seats vacant. [The poll tracker\'s
analysis gives Republicans an 80 percent chance of holding between 215
and 258 seats.]{.underline} If the larger figure proves accurate, that
would be a huge gain for the GOP, though it remains an outside
possibility. The single worst midterm loss of House seats occurred in
2010 when Democrats lost 63 seats under then President Barack Obama.
However, Obama\'s party retained control of the Senate until the 2014
midterms. [[It seems likely that Republican gains this year will
be]{.mark} more [modest but that the **GOP will still win the
House**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That will allow House Minority Leader
Kevin McCarthy to become speaker for the first time and possibly mean
the end of Speaker Nancy Pelosi\'s political career. [FiveThirtyEight\'s
[generic congressional ballot shows]{.mark} Republicans with 44.8
percent support to the Democrats\' 43.2 percent, as of July 6 - [a
**margin** of just 1.7 percent]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### b. Link: Plan is a win for Dems because it distracts voters from Biden's failures -- foreign policy leadership and alliance support increase democratic turnout. 

**Kuttner, 3/23** (Robert Kuttner, co founder and coeditor of the
American Prospect, Professor at Brandeis University, "Democracy Summer",

[[The survival of Democrats in 2022 will **depend heavily on
turnout**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Though Donald Trump will not be on the
ballot, he will be our not-so-secret weapon. [American
[presidents]{.mark} routinely [encounter crises]{.mark} they didn't
anticipate.]{.underline} Barack Obama hoped to pull back from
foreign-policy adventures and heal America's racial divides; he ended up
getting bogged down in the worst financial collapse since the Great
Depression and entangled in new foreign-policy messes. LBJ was going to
complete FDR's New Deal and redeem Lincoln's emancipation; he blew it
all in Vietnam. Woodrow Wilson got elected on the slogan "He kept us out
of war," hoping instead to complete his progressive domestic agenda; he
ended up winning the war, losing the peace, and ushering in a decade of
Republican rule. [Yet it feels like Joe Biden is setting the record for
the most simultaneous unexpected crises]{.underline}. He sought to
return the country to a competent, normal chief executive who did not
govern by fabrications and tweets, one who would repair democracy and
support an activist government countervailing predatory capitalism.
Instead, Biden got two more waves of COVID, an economic boom hobbled by
supply-shock inflation, faithless members of his own party blocking much
of his agenda, and the gravest wartime emergency since the Cuban missile
crisis of 1962. One thinks of a line attributed to Emerson: "Events are
in the saddle and ride mankind." It's easy to forget amid that run, but
from spring 2020 to summer 2021 Biden was the luckiest politician in
living memory. He went from a moribund presidential campaign in February
to becoming the certain nominee in March, thanks to the South Carolina
primary and Jim Clyburn. Given the immense stakes of defeating Trump, he
benefited from rare party unity. Progressive also-rans Elizabeth Warren
and Bernie Sanders traded loyalty for influence, and ended up
substantially shaping both Biden's surprisingly progressive program and
his personnel. After Biden took office, he was able to unite Democrats
on the far-reaching \$1.9 trillion ARPA relief law, and catch a wave of
emerging economic recovery and subsiding COVID cases. His approval
ratings were far from stratospheric but more than serviceable, with a
positive spread of 10 to 15 points up until last summer. But [Lady Luck
deserted Biden]{.underline}. COVID resurged with the delta variant. A
supply shock not of Biden's making exploded on his watch, spiking
inflation. [He made unforced errors in the long-overdue withdrawal from
Afghanistan, despite getting the policy directionally
right]{.underline}. As Joe [Manchin and]{.underline} Kyrsten [Sinema
blocked]{.underline} major elements of [his program]{.underline},
**[[Biden looked like a leader who couldn't
govern]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By the new year, Biden's approval ratings
were negative by more than 20 points. [All of this [portended]{.mark}
disaster for the November midterms and the survival of democracy itself.
[THEN]{.mark} VLADIMIR PUTIN DECIDED to [invade Ukraine, and we]{.mark}
got to [see Biden at his best]{.mark}]{.underline}. The president issued
early warnings of Putin's designs, using the unorthodox tactic of making
public raw intelligence reports. This wrong-footed Putin---not enough to
dissuade him from invading, but exposing his deceptions. [[**Biden got
credit** for reviving]{.mark} and unifying **[the Western
alliance]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and organizing a program of damaging
economic sanctions. [All this knocked the Republicans off their usual
game, isolated Putin apologists, and produced more bipartisan unity than
anything seen in Biden's presidency]{.underline}. This was not the work
of a foreign-policy establishment reverting to Cold War autopilot. These
[[**successes** reflected Biden's own foreign-policy
leadership]{.mark},]{.underline} in extensive conversations with allied
leaders, congressional figures in both parties, and Ukraine's heroic
Volodymyr Zelensky. Biden's leadership and Zelensky's courage have drawn
strength from each other. [[It]{.mark} also [drove a rapid
**resurgence** in the polls]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to the
Marist Poll done for NPR and PBS, public approval for Biden's handling
of the Ukraine war rose from 34 percent in late February to 52 percent
on March 3. [[This **spilled over**]{.mark} into increased approval for
Biden generally and for his performance on other issues,]{.underline}
thanks in part to the waning of omicron. Some 55 percent approved his
handling of COVID, up from 47 percent, and his overall approval rating
bounced back to 47 percent, the best margin since early fall. Even on
the economy, Biden's approval recovered to 45 percent from a previous 36
percent. (More recent polls show about ten points negative overall.) [A
Russian occupation of Ukraine could drag on inconclusively, with the
disruptions to the global economy further spiking energy prices and
inflation.]{.underline} Putin could stumble into the first ground war
between Russia and NATO, bringing the world closer to nuclear
conflagration. [Yet [Biden]{.mark}'s [une**xpected wartime
leadership**]{.mark} to date has **[caused skeptical voters to give him
a second look]{.mark}** and maybe a second chance. **[The Russia-Ukraine
war]{.mark}** may also have [spillovers that are **good for
progressives**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It shows that global capitalism can
and should be regulated in the national interest after all. The war has
also tempered the Fed's rush to raise interest rates. Politically, the
most consequential spillover is that [Putin's invasion and Biden's
response make Donald **Trump** even more radioactive.]{.underline} [[It
**reminds voters** how Putin and Trump are twin
thugs]{.mark},]{.underline} joined at the hip. [THE USUAL PATTERN IS
that the first midterm congressional election is a disaster for a new
president's party. However, 2022 will be anything but a normal off-year
election.]{.underline} Neither Biden nor Trump will be on the ballot.
But Trump, unsavory and unwelcome to Republicans outside hardcore MAGA
territory, will be omnipresent. [America today has few swing voters, but
**[dozens of swing districts where turnout will determine the
winner]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [If Democratic voters turn out,
Democrats win.]{.underline} With the failure of Congress to enact voting
rights legislation, however, the worry is that suppression could offset
mobilization. [Low Democratic turnout in the elections of November 2021
could portend a midterm with Republicans on the march and Democrats
dispirited.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Gridlock Econ Impact

#### c. Impacts: 

#### 1. GOP victory key to the economy -- gridlock good for markets and republicans are better on growth

**Klebnikov 22** (Sergei Klebnikov is a senior reporter at Forbes
covering markets and business news. "Here's What Happens To The Stock
Market If Republicans Take Congress In November," Published 1/19/22,

[[Stocks are off to a rocky start]{.mark} so far this year]{.underline}
thanks to a laundry list of challenges including inflation spikes and
interest rate hikes. [Midterm elections in November are going to make
2022 even trickier]{.underline} by adding yet another layer of
uncertainty to the investing mix. [Consumer prices are surging with
inflation at nearly 40-year highs, supply chain issues continue to
persist and coronavirus cases are spiking]{.underline} due to the
Omicron variant. What's more, the Federal Reserve has started tightening
monetary policy in a bid to control inflation: Once the central bank
finishes tapering its monthly asset purchases in March, it intends to
hike interest rates three times later this year--something it hasn't
done since 2018. ["The worst that can happen **for [Democrats]{.mark} is
if they [lose]{.mark} control** over both houses of Congress. In that
case **[the market would win]{.mark} by losing**, and see]{.underline} a
slightly [improved average performance."]{.underline} Sam Stovall, chief
investment strategist at CFRA Research Come November, Republicans are
hoping to win back control of either the House of Representatives or the
Senate. They'll need five seats to win a majority in the House and one
seat in the Senate. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia and
Florida all have key elections that could determine whether or not
Congress flips. ["**[The most favorable outcome for markets would be a
Republican win in both the House and the Senate,"]{.mark}** says Jeremy
Siegel]{.underline}, the Russell E. Palmer Professor of Finance [at the
Wharton School]{.underline} of the University of Pennsylvania. "If
Republicans take the House and not the Senate, that would also be a
relatively favorable outcome." To find out how various election results
would impact stocks, Forbes analyzed market data going back to 1945 with
the help of CFRA Research. In short, [[when it comes to stock market
performance]{.underline},]{.mark} Democratic presidents have an edge.
From 1945 through the end of 2021, the compound annual growth rate for
the S&P 500 has been 9.4% under Democratic presidents compared with 6.6%
for Republican commanders-in-chief. **[[The best
returns]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [**[have come under Democratic
presidents kept in check by a split or Republican Congress]{.mark}**.
"Historically, investors prefer shared power across the Federal
government,"]{.underline} says RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas. For
instance, [President Barack [Obama faced a split Congress]{.mark} from
November 2010 to 2014]{.underline}, with Republicans holding the House
of Representatives while Democrats held the Senate. [Equity investors
weren't complaining: [The S&P 500 surged nearly 70% during that
period]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[Markets historically prefer Democratic
presidents kept in check by a split Republican Congress.]{.underline}**
The S&P 500 average return in years where Democrats have simultaneously
held the Oval Office and both houses of Congress is 10.5%. While those
returns are nothing to balk at, the best-case scenario for
investors---with a 13.6% average gain for the S&P 500---is when a
Democratic president is presiding over a split Congress. [The
second-best performance, with a 13% average gain: A Democratic president
working with a unified Republican Congress.]{.underline} "The worst that
can happen for Democrats is if they lose control over both houses of
Congress," says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for CFRA
Research. "In that case the market would win by losing---meaning that
Wall Street will see a slightly improved average performance."

Place your bets for [[the]{.mark} coming [race to
growth]{.mark}.]{.underline} It [[will]{.mark} [be]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n
epic [contest]{.mark}]{.underline} among the world's most significant
economies, **[[with]{.underline}]{.mark}** generational and
**[[geopolitical]{.mark} [consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For
context, [think back to what the United States accomplished after World

world]{.underline}. [[The]{.underline}
[post-COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}[19 [race]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[could]{.underline} **[determine whether]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
[[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} rebounds in a manner that allows it to
**[[retain]{.underline}]{.mark}** the mantle of **[global
[leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}**. More likely [for the moment,
[Beijing could leverage]{.mark} its]{.underline} first-mover advantage
-- alongside [[a faster]{.mark} [economic recovery]{.mark}]{.underline}
across Asian markets -- [accelerating the trend toward a Chinese-centric
globalization]{.underline}. Elsewhere, as President Macron
[argued](https://www.ft.com/content/3ea8d790-7fd1-11ea-8fdb-7ec06edeef84)
[this]{.underline} week to the Financial Times, the coming months
[**[could determine]{.mark}** [**whether** the **E**]{.mark}uropean
**[U]{.mark}**nion **[collapses]{.mark}** as a political and economic
project]{.underline}. The days ahead also **[[could]{.mark}
[trigger]{.mark}]{.underline}** a dangerous widening of the economic gap
between emerging markets and the developed world -- with **[[escalating
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** and surging migration. It may seem
premature to reflect on which of the globe's economies is likely to have
the most robust and lasting economic comeback -- and with what
geopolitical impact. After all, this was a week in which the
International Monetary Fund
[projected](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/04/14/weo-april-2020)
a 3% contraction in global GDP for 2020, the most dramatic drop since
the Great Depression. Yet it is the details behind that dismal forecast
that should raise concerns within the U.S. and Europe. [Their
**[steep]{.mark}er [economic decline and slow]{.mark}er
[recovery]{.mark}** [could lay the seeds for a long-lasting
shift]{.mark} of global tectonic plates [to China's
advantage]{.mark}.]{.underline} The IMF projected a U.S. economic
decline of about 6% in 2020 and a contraction of the eurozone of 7.5%.
That compares to projected Chinese economic growth for 2020 of 1.2%
after a first quarter real decline of 6.7% -- far less than the 10%-plus
dip many experts had expected. The only group of countries in the world
projected to be in positive territory are East Asian, at roughly 1%.
Even if one accepts that Chinese coronavirus fatalities likely are
greater than their public figures and that the growth decline is likely
larger, that doesn't change the potential for a scenario that Deloitte
and Salesforce this week [referred
to](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/covid-19/covid-19-scenarios-and-impacts-for-business-and-society-world-remade.html)
as "Sunrise in the East." Describing this scenario, as one of four
possibilities they list, they write, "[The global center of power shifts
decisively east as [China]{.mark}]{.underline} and other East Asian
nations [take the reigns]{.underline} as primary powers [on the world
stage]{.underline} [and lead]{.underline} global coordination of the
health system and other multilateral [institutions]{.underline}." [That
[comes with]{.mark} the]{.underline} [[broader acceptance of]{.mark}
greater **[surveillance]{.mark}** mechanisms as part of the public
good]{.underline}, a faster recovery of East Asian countries with less
economic impact from COVID19, [and a significant ramping up of
Chinese]{.underline} foreign direct investment to burnish its [global
reputation]{.underline}. Still, the U.S. has a host of incumbent
advantages that could serve it well if it uses its economic recovery to
also strengthen its infrastructure, if it reverses runaway unemployment
quickly, if it can tame political polarization and, most significantly,
if it rediscovers its taste for collaborative global leadership. In the
economic race, no advantage is greater than the dollar. China may be the
world's second largest economy, but the Chinese yuan [makes
up](https://asiatimes.com/2019/12/yuan-globalization-remains-a-long-way-off/)
only 2% of global payments and reserves while the dollar
[accounts](https://asiatimes.com/2019/12/yuan-globalization-remains-a-long-way-off/)
for roughly two thirds of foreign exchange reserves. The dollar
[underpins](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/04/16/the-dollars-dominance-masks-chinas-rise-in-finance)
four-fifths of global supply chains. The Economist
[reckons](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/04/16/the-dollars-dominance-masks-chinas-rise-in-finance)
China could chip away at U.S. economic advantages through three
underestimated strengths of its own: as a trusted debtor, an attractive
creditor, and increasingly as a tech partner. As a debtor, China's \$13
trillion bond market is the world's second largest and [has weathered
the crisis
well](https://www.ft.com/content/41044876-6ab4-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75).
Chinese debt
[returned](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-cuts-us-treasury-debt-holding-by-13/)
1.3% in the first quarter, vastly better than the 15.5%
[decline](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/04/16/the-dollars-dominance-masks-chinas-rise-in-finance)
for other emerging market bonds. Over the same period, the Chinese
market added \$8.5 billion (60 billion yuan) in net inflows. As a
creditor, China has remained willing and generous, an approach that
served the U.S. well after World War II. For example, it
[declared](https://www.ft.com/content/5f296d54-d29e-4e87-ae7d-95ca6c0598d5)
its willingness to back a G20 deal to suspend bilateral loan repayments
by poorer countries, a sizable benefit also at its own cost. On the tech
front, few countries were as ready as China for money and people to go
entirely online. Tencent and Ant Financial have more than a billion
users each for their digital wallets, and they are expanding rapidly
throughout Asia. OneConnect, an offshoot of China's largest insurer,
provides financial institutions in sixteen Asian countries with
cloud-based services. So, what other advantages can the United States
leverage in this race? Never underestimate the brittleness of an
authoritarian country under stress. Its broad censorship, it's opaque
legal system, and the nature of its surveillance state are hardly models
to emulate. Beyond that, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is not alone
[in
proposing](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Xi-fears-Japan-led-manufacturing-exodus-from-China)
that his country relocate high-value supply chains from China. If many
countries do the same, the manufacturing foundation of China's economy
could erode. The Financial Times' Gideon Rachman
[adds](https://www.ft.com/content/2e8c8f76-7cbd-11ea-8fdb-7ec06edeef84)
that the global trust in the dollar is just one of two built-in U.S.
advantages that are difficult to dislodge. The other? "Where, outside
your home country, would you most like your children to go to university
or to work?" he writes. Most significant in this race would be if
**[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [regained]{.mark}]{.underline}**
its appetite for political and economic **[[leadership as
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** world's premier "[**[convening
power."]{.underline}**]{.mark} That need not be done at the cost of
China -- or anyone else. The race still can be won if U.S. leaders see
it as a marathon and recall that much of the world long embraced their
global leadership because partners learned they were more likely to win
as American partners. This economic rebound from COVID19 will be patchy
and uneven. [**[Being first out the gate will be significant]{.mark}**,
and that is likely to be China]{.underline}. Yet history has taught the
United States that it's victory will be longest lasting if it can
achieved alongside partners and allies.

### 1NC -- Energy Security Impact 

#### c. Impacts: 

#### 1. GOP win key to energy independence and emission reductions. 

**Reams '22** (Heather Reams is the president at Citizens for
Responsible Energy Solutions, a nonprofit organization that advocates
for clean energy policy, "Under Republican Leadership, Expect Lower
Global Emissions and Increased Energy Independence", RealClear Energy,
<https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2022/06/15/under_republican_leadership_expect_lower_global_emissions_and_increased_energy_independence_837376.html>,
6/15/22. Accessed 7-14-22) - AC

**[[Under Republican Leadership, Expect Lower]{.mark} Global [Emissions
and Increased Energy Independence]{.mark}]{.underline}**" By all
accounts, [Republicans are well-positioned to take back the House of the
Representatives next Congress.]{.underline} That comes as welcomed news
for the overwhelming majority of [Americans who support "commonsense"
policies to reduce emissions that cause climate change and reduce energy
costs that are devastating American families today.]{.underline} Last
week, the U.S. House Republican Energy, Climate, and Conservation (ECC)
Taskforce led by Rep. Garret Graves of Louisiana -- a leading
conservative advocate for lowering global emissions while increasing
U.S. productivity -- introduced the first of its six-part policy
framework seeking to rebalance our nation's economic, energy and
environmental agenda. The six-point plan, which rolls out over the
course of the summer, is rooted in fundamental conservative
principles---lowering costs for American families, investing in America,
innovating, [[unlocking American resources, eliminating]{.mark}
government [obstacles that delay]{.mark} deployment of [clean energy,
reducing reliance on adversarial nations]{.mark} like China and Russia,
enhancing our national security, [and reducing global
**emissions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This plan recognizes the value of a
free-market system that demands efficiency and has made the United
States one of the most carbon-efficient producers in the world, whether
it is energy, agriculture, or manufacturing. It is also an approach that
differs from long held conventional wisdom on the political left that
constraining the American economy and increasing energy costs for
American families are necessary to address climate change. [[The
Republican plan recognizes **global realities**]{.mark} and responds to
those realities with actions to reduce both domestic and global
emissions as opposed to costly policies that nearsightedly focus solely
on domestic emissions without regard to their global
impact]{.underline}. The average product made in China results in over
three times the emissions than a product made in the United States. When
America produces, we reduce. [[When America innovates, we
reduce]{.mark}. When we constrain American production and allow other
nations to dominate markets, global emissions increase, and global
security is diminished.]{.underline} Conservatives recognize [[America
can regain its **energy** i**ndependenc**e]{.mark} by expediting the
deployment of innovative clean energy technologies.]{.underline} This
means reshaping the federal regulatory and permitting processes to
increase predictability, shorten the time to project delivery, and
reduce costs while still providing for robust consideration of public
and environmental concerns. These commonsense improvements will push
much-needed clean energy projects forward at a time when Americans
continue to face growing price tags at the gas pump and supermarket.
[Republicans have long sounded alarm bells our nation must prioritize
energy independence]{.underline}. The ongoing war in Ukraine made it
clear: we must abandon the energy resources provided by hostile
countries and relieve our allies of their dependence on those same
nations---if not for our national security, for our pocketbooks. America
is fortunate to have abundant, clean and low-cost natural gas.
Increasing America's natural gas production can support our domestic
energy needs and the needs of our allies to help offset their Russian
imports while reducing global emissions. According to the Department of
Energy's National Energy Technology Lab, Russian natural gas exported to
Europe results in 41% more global emissions than U.S. liquefied natural
gas (LNG) exported to Europe. The Biden Administration recently released
projections showing [[global demand for natural gas increasing]{.mark}
over the coming decades in every modeled scenario. Who supplies
[that]{.mark} demand [will have far reaching geopolitical, economic and
global emissions implications]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It's time to
reclaim our global energy dominance and bring back critical supply
chains to the United States]{.underline}. This includes embracing an
all-of-the-above approach to domestic energy production that invests in
homegrown energy sources for tomorrow's use while developing
technologies that will enhance the environment performance of reliable
and affordable abundant domestic resources -- including critical
minerals. Our nation is blessed with a wealth of critical minerals
necessary for clean energy technologies---including solar, wind and
electric vehicles. They are also vital for our national defense systems.
[Conservatives are pushing to remove roadblocks to better enable
environmentally responsible domestic mining]{.underline}, processing,
and refining of critical minerals in the U.S., and through partnership
with our allies. [Doing so will reverse our trend of dependency on
places like China, Russia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
significantly reduce emissions if mined in the United
States]{.underline}. Last week, in conjunction with the initial roll-out
of Republican's climate and energy policy strategy, Rep. Graves,

Rep. Yvette Herrell (R-NM). New Mexico embodies the GOP's
all-of-the-above vision for domestic energy production---ranking second
in the nation in crude oil production and among the top ten in natural
gas. In fact, Hobbs is in the famous Permian Basin---the largest
petroleum-producing basin in the United States. But the state also
generates 30 percent of its energy from wind power---ranking sixth in
the country---and is on the cutting edge of nuclear energy innovation
and research and development (R&D) thanks to its two national
laboratories: Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National
Laboratory. Conservatives know that when we harness what's best about
America, as exemplified by states like New Mexico, we can move our
country forward. [Under [**Republican** leadership]{.mark}, the

[[The]{.mark} budding [**US role** as]{.mark} an [**energy superpower**
offers]{.mark} a number of **[opportunities]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
the new administration and the American natural gas industry. At the
same time, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[faces]{.mark} a number of
challenges: [a **resurgent Russia**]{.mark}, a vulnerable
and]{.underline} potentially [[**fracturing Europe**, and]{.mark} an
**[unstable Middle East]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [How can Washington
leverage its natural gas endowment for diplomatic aims]{.underline}
under these circumstances? How should the United States lead in the
international gas markets given the new geopolitics of natural gas? As
Donald J. Trump takes office as the forty-fifth president of the United
States on January 20, 2017, his administration will have an opportunity
to reassess US energy policy, specifically, its natural gas policy. This
reassessment will not only be a by-product of a change in leadership in
Washington, but is necessitated by the fundamental transformation of the
world's natural gas markets since President Barack Obama took office
eight years ago. In 2011, [the]{.underline} [I]{.underline}nternational
[E]{.underline}nergy [A]{.underline}gency [proclaimed that the world
energy markets were entering "the golden age of gas."]{.underline}1
Since then, [the natural gas markets have seen an influx of new gas
sources, greater liquidity, a growing]{.underline} liquefied natural gas
([LNG]{.underline}) [trade]{.underline}, a buildup of gas transport
infrastructure, and an increased appetite for natural gas as a cleaner
fossil fuel alternative to oil or coal. [The boom in US shale gas
development]{.underline}, which also irreversibly altered America's
natural gas industry, [spearheaded many of these worldwide
changes]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [emerged as the world's leading gas producer in
2011 and as an LNG exporter in 2016]{.underline}, with US inaugural
deliveries to Brazil, India, United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Portugal,
Kuwait, Chile, Spain, China, Jordan, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico.
[In the coming years, the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [stands to become one of the world's leading LNG
exporters]{.underline}. [The geopolitics of natural gas is already
undergoing a significant shift]{.underline}. [The emergence of new
gas]{.underline} resources [and]{.underline} the [[growth of **LNG
trade** are challenging]{.mark} the half-century-long status quo of
global gas relations]{.underline}. Traditional gas [suppliers like
**[Russia]{.mark}** are seeing their influence wane, while gas-importing
states have more **flexibility** and optionality]{.underline} in their
import sources. [[US]{.mark} LNG [exports add **greater liquidity**
to]{.mark} the [global]{.mark} natural gas [markets
and]{.mark}]{.underline} thus can help [[**secure** and **diversify**
Europe's supplies]{.underline}]{.mark}. Direct deliveries are also
possible as per US early exports to Spain and Portugal. Moreover, [[US
LNG]{.mark} can **[contain]{.mark}** the influence of]{.underline}
Russian gas behemoth Gazprom and [[Moscow's use of gas]{.mark} supplies
[as a foreign policy tool]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It
can]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[court]{.mark}** energy-hungry Asian
powers like **[China]{.mark}**, which has been trying to secure its
natural gas imports]{.underline} and has looked to Russia as a potential
supplier. If properly leveraged, [America's]{.underline} newfound
[energy prowess can be an invaluable tool of diplomacy
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} help [**[ensure]{.mark}** that [**US and
allied leadership** continues]{.mark} to guide the twenty-first
century]{.underline}. While over the past few years, US energy policy
has seen divisive partisan debate over energy production, exports, and
how to address climate change, the benefits of the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[']{.underline} [natural gas boom offer room for
bipartisan agreement]{.underline}. [The **economic**, **climatic**,
**security**, and **geopolitical** gains awarded by the rise of US
domestic energy production offer many benefits]{.underline} for the next
US administration. While some would prefer to see more environmental
regulation in domestic gas production, especially in regards to
fracking, and others would prefer to boost production to maximize
economic and energy security benefits, at this point neither the
Democrats nor the Republicans would seek to block US LNG exports or
hinder the American natural gas industry. Moreover, [in light of climate
change concerns, many regard [gas]{.mark} as a cleaner fossil fuel that
can [serve as a **bridge to renewables**]{.mark}]{.underline},
potentially [[reducing]{.mark} carbon dioxide
**[emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

## Uniqueness

### 2NC -- Uniqueness

#### Republicans will win the midterm now -- that's Roche -- the race is close, but the best poll gives the GOP an 80% chance thanks to Biden's low approval rating. 

#### And, Republicans win now -- Dem enthusiasm is temporary.

[[With]{.mark} **President [Biden's approval rating mired]{.mark}** [in
the 30s]{.mark} and with nearly 80 percent of voters saying the country
is heading in]{.underline} [the wrong
direction](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/11/us/politics/biden-approval-polling-2024.html)[,
[all the ingredients seem]{.mark} to be [in place for a **Republican
sweep in the November midterm elections**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[But]{.underline}]{.mark} [Democrats and Republicans begin the campaign
in a [surprisingly close race for control of Congress]{.mark}, according
to the first New York Times/Siena College survey of the
cycle.]{.underline} Based on a New York Times/Siena College poll of 849
registered voters from July 5-7. Overall among registered voters, 41
percent said they preferred Democrats to control Congress compared with
40 percent who preferred Republican control. Among likely voters,
Republicans led by one percentage point, 44 percent to 43 percent,
reflecting the tendency for the party out of power to enjoy a turnout
advantage in midterms. [The results suggest that the wave of [mass
shootings and]{.mark} the recent Supreme Court decision to overturn [Roe
v. Wade have at least **temporarily insulated** the Democrats]{.mark}
from an otherwise hostile national political environment while
energizing the party's predominantly liberal activist base. [But the
confluence of **economic problems**]{.mark} **and resurgent cultural
issues** has helped turn the emerging class [divide]{.mark} in [the
Democratic coalition]{.mark} into a chasm, [as Republicans appear to be
making new inroads **among**]{.mark} **nonwhite and working-class
[voters]{.mark}** --- perhaps especially **Hispanic voters** --- who
remain more concerned about the economy and inflation than abortion
rights and guns.]{.underline} For the first time in a Times/Siena
national survey, Democrats had a larger share of support among white
college graduates than among nonwhite voters --- a striking indication
of the shifting balance of political energy in the Democratic coalition.
As recently as the 2016 congressional elections, Democrats won more than
70 percent of nonwhite voters while losing among white college
graduates. With four months to go until the election, it is far too soon
to say whether the campaign will remain focused on issues like abortion
and gun control long enough for Democrats to avoid a long-expected
midterm rout. If it does, a [close national vote would probably
translate to a close race for control of Congress, as neither party
enjoys a clear structural advantage in the race. **Partisan
[gerrymandering has slightly tilted the map toward Republicans]{.mark}
in the House**,]{.underline} but Democrats enjoy the advantages of
incumbency and superior fund-raising in key districts. Recent
unfavorable news for Democrats, in the form of [Supreme Court
rulings](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/21/us/major-supreme-court-cases-2022.html),
and some tragic news nationally might ordinarily mean trouble for the
party in power, but that's not what the results suggest. The first poll
of the midterm cycle. The New York Times has released its first national
survey of the 2022 midterm cycle. Here's what to know[: Biden's
struggles with Democrats. **[President Biden is facing an alarming level
of doubt from inside his own party]{.mark}**, with]{.underline} [64
percent of Democratic
voters](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/11/us/politics/biden-approval-polling-2024.html?smid=tw-nytimes&action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-nyt-polling&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc&smtyp=cur)
[saying they would prefer a new standard-bearer in 2024. Only 26 percent
of Democrats said the party should renominate him. A dark national mood.
Voters nationwide gave Mr. Biden a]{.underline} [meager 33 percent
job-approval
rating](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/11/us/politics/biden-approval-polling-2024.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-nyt-polling&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc)[,
and only 13 percent said the nation was on the right track.]{.underline}
Still, Mr. Biden maintained a narrow edge in a hypothetical 2024 rematch
with Donald J. Trump: 44 percent to 41 percent. Some in G.O.P. are ready
to leave Trump behind. As the former president weighs another White
House bid, [nearly half of Republican primary
voters](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/us/politics/trump-approval-polling-2024.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-nyt-polling&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc)
would prefer someone other than Mr. Trump for president in 2024, with a
significant number vowing to abandon him if he wins the nomination. A
tight race for Congress. Despite Mr. Biden's low approval ratings,
Democrats are roughly tied with Republicans ahead of the midterm
elections. Among registered voters, [41 percent said they preferred
Democrats](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/upshot/poll-2022-midterms-congress.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-nyt-polling&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc)
to control Congress compared with 40 percent who preferred Republicans.
The class divide widens. [Voters who said abortion, guns or threats to
democracy were the biggest problem facing the country]{.underline}
[backed Democrats by a wide
margin](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/upshot/poll-2022-midterms-congress.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-nyt-polling&region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc)[,

[Poll after poll showing voter discontent with President Biden and the
economy is cementing Republicans' sense that a GOP House majority is all
but inevitable]{.underline}, while [boosting their hopes about taking
control of the Senate]{.underline} and flipping some gubernatorial and
state-level seats. "The cake is pretty well baked at this point in favor
of the Republicans taking control of the House," said GOP consultant
John Thomas. ["The Republicans would have to willfully work to screw it
up.]{.underline} Doesn't mean it's impossible." A New York Times survey
highlighted on the paper's front page [on [Monday punctuated the grim
environment for Democrats]{.mark}. Just a quarter of Democratic voters
said Biden should be the presidential nominee in 2024]{.underline}, [and
the [sentiment that]{.mark} the [U.S. is headed in the wrong direction
has hit 77 percent]{.mark}]{.underline}, the highest since the height of
the 2008 financial crash. The survey is in line with numerous other
recent ones finding Biden's underwater approval rating. In an
environment like this, and barring any earth-shattering changes,
analysts say, the biggest liability for swing-seat Republicans are
themselves. And while there is near-universal optimism that Republicans
will win the House, the Senate and governorships are less certain[.
["Absent a miracle, there is no chance \[Democrats\] hold the House in
November,]{.underline}]{.mark} [and their only hope in the Senate will
be Republicans choosing terrible candidates,]{.underline} which they
have proven very capable of doing," said Rory Cooper, a veteran GOP
strategist. [[Republicans need to net only one seat to win control of
the Senate]{.underline}]{.mark}, but the electoral landscape there is
trickier and more based on individual candidates and races than in the
House. "I think those candidates have some work to do. [[If they can get
it within striking distance, the wave should put them
over,"]{.underline}]{.mark} Thomas said. Sarah Longwell, an anti-Trump
GOP strategist, pointed to candidates such as Hershel Walker, the
Trump-backed GOP Senate nominee in Georgia who was recently revealed to
be the father of three previously unknown children, being liabilities
for Republican hopes of winning key races. Though [it is a "broadly very
favorable environment for Republicans]{.underline}," Longwell said, she
could see a scenario where "Republicans do really well, they take the
House, but they lose a lot of these individual Senate races because
they've nominated cranks and extremists." GOP operatives, however, point
to Democrats signaling a poor strategy on their part in key races.

As clear as the data on midterm losses for sitting presidents is, as
unclear are the reasons behind it. Nobody really knows why the midterms
are so hard for incumbents irrespective of the political climate, but
depending on how [a president]{.underline} is doing, he [could be hit by
either apathy or disappointment among his own supporters]{.underline}.
Other than 9/11, [national crises have not proven a good predictor for
midterms either, which leave two more possible culprits: **presidential
approval** and the state of the economy.]{.underline} [Neither of these
is bound to look very favorable for Joe Biden in November.]{.underline}
A second poll by Gallup shows that Americans are not only enthusiastic
about the upcoming election but have also given it "quite a lot" of
thought. 48% said so this June compared with only 31% in the summer of
2014. Whether their interest in the current political issues will work
in Biden's favor remains to be seen.

#### Republicans win now -- they are on the path to control Hispanic turnout

[**Republicans are actively courting Hispanic voters in key competitive
House districts**, hoping to peel away voters from Democrats repeating
their historical pattern of investing little and late in reaching out to
Latinos]{.underline}. The GOP's approach is a danger to Democrats, as
**[Hispanic voters are likely to play a key role in at least a dozen
districts]{.underline}** in the November midterm elections. "It couldn't
be a starker contrast between Republicans and Democrats as we engage and
do outreach to minority voters, and specifically the Hispanic
community," said Danielle Alvarez, communications director for the GOP.
Hispanic Democrats in Congress outnumber Republicans 4 to 1, but [the
Republican Party has recruited a new generation of Hispanic candidates
at breakneck speed]{.underline}, most notably in Texas, but also in
states like Oregon and Virginia. The National Republican Congressional
Committee says **[it has recruited a total of 102 Hispanic candidates in
this cycle]{.underline}**. Excitement about making inroads in the
Hispanic community led Reps. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas) and Mario
Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) to launch the Hispanic Leadership Trust PAC in May,
aimed at growing the number of Hispanic members in the House. "Step one
is bringing back everybody that is Hispanic conservative Republican,"
Gonzales said. The GOP this week seized on a flub by Jill Biden
comparing the Hispanic community to breakfast tacos, which the first
lady has since apologized for, to help fuel Republicans' argument that
Democrats are not in touch with Hispanic voters. Alvarez called the
comment "disrespectful" and argued that it is "a window into how
Democrats view Hispanics." The Republican National Committee (RNC)
started selling shirts that read "Not your breakfast taco."
Historically, [most heavily Hispanic districts have had a deep
Democratic lean, with the exception of districts with proportionately
high Cuban American populations, which tend to lean Republican. But
recent polling is buoying Republicans who see a chance to make real
inroads with Hispanics amid national frustration over high gas prices
and inflation.]{.underline} A New York Times-Siena College poll this
month found that **[only 41 percent of Hispanics said they intended to
vote for Democrats in the upcoming midterms]{.underline}**, while 38
percent said they preferred GOP candidates. Statisticians warn that
polling of Hispanic voters is particularly difficult, and national polls
that use likely voter models have historically missed the mark. The Pew
Research Center's latest numbers, from March, on Hispanic voter intent
show 50 percent of Hispanics intended to vote for a Democratic
candidate, while only 28 percent intended to vote for a Republican. Pew
is due to release a new survey including weighted Hispanic voter intent
ahead of the midterms. Most observers agree that high Hispanic turnout
is likely to favor Democrats and low turnout Republicans, a reflection
that a broad majority of Hispanics are still more likely to vote
Democratic. Nonetheless, the favorable polls are putting a spark into
the GOP effort. "We never left the ground, and **[we've always been
engaging and having these conversations with Hispanic
communities]{.underline}** and diverse communities across the country,"
said Alvarez. [Rep. Juan Vargas]{.underline} (D-Calif.) [acknowledged
"some inroads" by the GOP when it comes to attracting Latino voters, but
quickly added that the trend has been "way overstated."]{.underline}
"Everyone has always looked at Latinos as this sort of singular group
and not diverse. The truth of the matter is we're as diverse as anybody
else --- may even more so," said Vargas, who represents a huge swath of
the border between California and Mexico. "People say, 'Look, there's
all these Latinos voting Republican.' And I say, 'They always have.' I
mean, because of social issues they always have," he said. "It's not a
big change, people are just noticing it now." Republicans argue they
started their 2022 outreach early by opening community centers where
staff work to build relationships with Hispanic communities, recruit and
train volunteers, register voters and turn them out to vote. The GOP
Latino community centers have opened in places where Hispanics
traditionally yield political power like Texas and Florida, but also in
places where growing Hispanic communities are shifting election results,
like Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nebraska and Wisconsin. Out of 30 RNC
community centers targeting minority communities, 12 are Hispanic
community centers. The centralized GOP outreach stands in contrast to a
Democratic machinery that's built a broad network of grassroots
organizations and a solid power base in the 36-member Congressional
Hispanic Caucus, but has struggled to inculcate an "early and often"
Hispanic outreach mantra in its upper echelons, like the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee or the House Majority PAC. The
expanding GOP outreach, led by Hispanic Republicans, is eroding an image
Democrats had cultivated of having a virtual monopoly on Hispanic
representation. In the five Texan districts along the U.S.-Mexico
border, all 10 major party House candidates are Hispanics with ties to
local communities. A similar phenomenon is happening in Florida's three
southernmost districts, where all three Republican incumbents are
Hispanic, as are the leading candidates in the Democratic primaries.
Vargas allowed that the situation in Texas might be different, because
of polls showing a number of Hispanic Democratic voters have recently
jumped parties to support the GOP. But in Vargas's mind, that switch is
just an indication that **[Texas Democrats haven't done enough outreach
to Latino voters in the state]{.underline}**. **["Outreach is a big
deal]{.underline}**, absolutely," he said. "The party has to do a much
better job, and they haven't." Vargas said that Democrats in Texas are
assuming Hispanic voters will vote Democratic. "I mean, they're taking
them for granted. We certainly don't in California," Vargas said. The
GOP's Hispanic outreach is aided by candidates who tend to follow party
orthodoxy with more discipline than their Democratic counterparts.
Alvarez said that "the extremism of the Democrats woke leftist movement"
contributes to Hispanic voters moving toward the GOP, noting use of the
term "Latinx" and mentioning education on gender identity and sexuality
in elementary schools. "We're actually more conservative than the
average voter on these issues," said Alvarez. New candidates like Rep.
Mayra Flores (R-Texas), who won a special election to represent a
formerly Democratic Rio Grande Valley district earlier this year, have
hit the ground running on party messaging, using Twitter to lash out
against Democrats and paint an image of an inevitable GOP wave among
Latinos. "It's really important to have not only the right message but
the right candidates to deliver the message," Alvarez said.

In January, FiveThirtyEight published a story with the headline, "Some
Early Clues About How the Midterms Will Go." The authors, Alex Samuels
and Nathaniel Rakich, named [four things to watch during the election

special-election results, and individual election polls.]{.underline}
Six months later, [[all signs point to a **great night** for Republicans
in November.]{.mark} With **one asterisk**.]{.underline} Let's look at
some numbers. Job Approval. This week [[Biden dropped below 40 percent
approval]{.underline}]{.mark} in both the FiveThirtyEight and
RealClearPolitics averages of polls. [His net approval is -14 points in
both averages.]{.underline} The latest executive order is more a signal
of the administration's desire for expansive abortion access than a set
of actionable policies. Take a moment to consider how terrible that is.
According to the Gallup poll, at this point in earlier midterm cycles,
[Donald Trump was at -5 net approval, Barack Obama was at +2, and Bill
Clinton was at +5. All three presidents went on to lose the House of
Representatives. Clinton lost the Senate as well.]{.underline} Biden is
much worse off than his immediate predecessors. "No president with an
underwater net approval rating since World War II has ever lost fewer
seats than Obama's 13 in 2014," wrote Samuels and Rakich. At this
writing, [Republicans only need to net nine seats to win the
House]{.underline}. [[Negative job approval is a sure sign of
**impending defeat**]{.mark}.]{.underline} And it will take a miracle
for Biden's standing to improve before Election Day. Congressional
Generic Ballot. Since the beginning of the year, [Republicans have led
Democrats in both the FiveThirtyEight and RealClearPolitics averages of
the congressional generic ballot]{.underline}. [That lead is small ---
about three points --- but stable.]{.underline} And it may underestimate
the Republican advantage. Most pollsters are still conducting surveys of
registered voters, who tend to lean more Democratic than the electorate
that shows up to vote in November. Plus, Samuels and Rakich wrote,
"Generic-ballot polling has historically tended to get worse for the
president's party as the cycle wears on." Absent a deus ex machina in
which a winged chariot is sent from the heavens to lower gas prices, end
the war in Ukraine, lock up violent criminals, and secure the southern
border, House Democrats are doomed. Special Elections. On June 14,
Republican Mayra Flores trounced Democrat Dan Sanchez in a majority
Hispanic congressional district on the Mexican border. Her victory
wasn't just evidence that the Hispanic vote is migrating to the GOP. [It
also [supports the case for a **Republican wave**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
"If a party consistently outperforms its typical margins in these
irregularly scheduled elections---like Democrats did in 2017 and early
2018---it is usually a sign that the political environment is leaning in
its direction," Rakich wrote in April. The most recent margin in Texas's
34th congressional district was five points for the Democrats. Flores
beat Sanchez by eight points. That's a 13-point swing toward the
Republican Party. And the Texas special election followed similar
elections in California and Alaska where Republicans also
over-performed. When he wrote about special elections in April, Rakich
warned that there wasn't enough data to identify a trend. Well, to quote
another election-watcher, I've seen enough. [The results of special
elections are in line with a Republican triumph on November
8.]{.underline} Individual Races. The toplines --- [stagflation,
historic trends, Biden's job approval, the generic ballot, enthusiasm
--- favor the GOP.]{.underline} The Democratic House is lost. Here's the
asterisk. [[Rep]{.mark}ublican[s]{.mark} [need only a single pickup to
win]{.mark} control of [the Senate]{.mark}. [But Republican Senate
candidates are struggling]{.mark}.]{.underline} The first
general-election poll in Pennsylvania has Democrat John Fetterman
leading Republican Mehmet Oz by nine points. And Fetterman hasn't
campaigned since he was hospitalized for a stroke last month. The most
recent poll in North Carolina has Democrat Cheri Beasley leading
Republican Ted Budd by four points. [[The Rep]{.mark}ublican [candidates
who are ahead **aren't** ahead by much.]{.mark}]{.underline} The most
recent poll in Ohio has Republican J. D. Vance leading Democrat Tim Ryan
by three points. The latest poll in Georgia has Republican Herschel
Walker tied with Democrat senator Raphael Warnock. Now [it's entirely
possible that Republican Senate candidates will **gain** as they become
better known, define their opponents, and benefit from the backlash
against President Biden.]{.underline} It's entirely possible the polls
are off and that, as happened in Tom Cotton's race in 2014, single-digit
polling leads will turn into big wins on Election Day.
[Still]{.underline}, the [[Rep]{.mark}ublican [Senate team in 2022
**isn't as strong** as it was eight years
ago]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The roster this year looks more like
it did in 2010 and 2012. And those seasons were disappointing. No one
wants to relive the frustration and fury of 2011 through 2015, when
Republicans controlled only the House of Representatives. [[GOP Senate
candidates need to recognize]{.underline}]{.mark}, quickly, that
[[elections are won not in Mar-a-Lago but in the
suburbs]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[as they surf the **red wave**]{.mark}
headed toward Washington]{.underline}.

### U -- Dem Turnout Down

[Democratic voters aren't turning out]{.underline} --- yet Primary
turnout has historically been a poor indicator of general election
turnout, but in a year in which Democrats are desperate for younger,
lower-propensity voters to find their way to the polls, the [early
turnout numbers in Illinois and New York on Tuesday were another bad
sign.]{.underline} In Illinois, [early vote totals were lagging
2018]{.underline} totals both statewide and in Chicago, the kind of big,
Democratic city where an outpouring of voters due to Roe, if one were to
come, would have been expected. It was the same story in New York, where
turnout was expected to be lackluster. Democrats may be furious about
Trump's behavior on Jan. 6 or about the Supreme Court's behavior last
week. But it's not translating into voting --- at least not yet.
"Nobody's turning out," said one Democratic strategist in Illinois who
requested anonymity to speak freely. "I mean nobody. [Nobody is voting
... The early vote numbers are abysmally bad." The strategist said
voters are "pissed off" but that between Roe and voting, "I don't think
people are connecting the dots]{.underline}." Democrats came into the
midterm election cycle facing historic headwinds, widely expected to
lose the House in November. And [things haven't been going their way
since]{.underline}. President Joe Biden's public approval rating has
dropped below 40 percent. Inflation does not appear to be going
anywhere, and a recession may be near. There is still a path for
Democrats to blunt Republicans' gains. If Democrats can prosecute the
case on Roe effectively, their voters could have reason to turn out in
November. And the Jan. 6 committee may get what James Carville, the
former Bill Clinton strategist, called a "head of steam." It certainly
looked like it might on Tuesday. "The path is not impossible," Carville
said. Still, early voting in the general election isn't far off. ["If
this needle doesn't move by the end of July,"]{.underline} Carville
said, ["it's probably not going to move."]{.underline}

[All signs are pointing to a difficult midterm election for President
Biden and Democrats, and a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll has fresh
evidence of that]{.underline}. Of the 1,162 registered voters surveyed,
[47% said they are more likely to vote for the Republican in their
district, as opposed to 44% who said Democrats.]{.underline} (The poll
has a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points, which means results
could be almost 4 points higher or lower.) It\'s the first time in eight
years that Marist\'s survey has found Republicans with an advantage on
the congressional ballot test. Back then, months before the 2014 midterm
elections, Republicans had a 5-point edge in the poll and then won
control of both the House and Senate. [This past November, Democrats had
a 5-point advantage on the question, and traditionally, Democrats need a
lead of at least a few points to do well or break even. That\'s because
their voters are largely compacted in urban areas and because
congressional districts across the U.S. are drawn in a way that broadly
favors Republicans.]{.underline} When Democrats won control of the House
in 2018, they had a 6-point edge in the poll, for example. [In this
survey, independents --- an important swing group, particularly in
suburban areas --- said they favor Republicans by 7 points, 45% to
38%.]{.underline} There is a significant gender gap overall and in
suburbs, with a majority of women favoring Democrats and a majority of
men wanting Republicans in charge. Republicans with the edge on key
issues [Republicans are also favored on a raft of issues, including
double-digit advantages on inflation, crime and national security.
Inflation, in particular, is critical, considering Americans say it is
their top concern. Of note, about three times as many independents say
they think Republicans would do a better job controlling inflation as
they say Democrats.]{.underline}

#### Republicans win midterms due to Trumpism

**Ulmer 5/26**/22 -- (Alexandra Ulmer is a U.S. National Correspondent
with Reuters. "Beyond Donald Trump, Trumpism is the winner in U.S.
midterm primaries,\" Japan Times, 5-26-2022,

-- LASA LC

The crushing defeat of David Perdue in Tuesday's Republican
gubernatorial primary in Georgia likely delighted Donald Trump's
adversaries, who have been keeping scorecards to measure the performance
of election candidates backed by the former U.S. president. [**Trump has
weighed in on November's midterm elections** like no former president,
announcing more than **190 endorsements** and holding rallies with his
proteges.]{.underline} [The success of his endorsees is seen as a key
sign of his continued influence over the party as he hints at another
run for the White House in 2024. But political analysts and Republican
strategists caution that any jubilation among Trump's enemies over
Perdue's loss to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is short-sighted, and that any
scorecard is a poor barometer for the state of Trumpism in the United
States in 2022. While Trump's candidates have had mixed success so far
this year in party primaries, **many Republican voters still embrace
Trump's false claims of voter fraud** in the 2020 election, as well as
his right-wing]{.underline}, "America First" populist ideology. [And
failure to win Trump's endorsement has not stopped some Republican
candidates from **going hard-right to try to win over his
base**.]{.underline} "In 2016, Trump was really the only candidate
running as that sort of populist. Now it's increasingly what most
Republican primary candidates sound like," said Republican strategist
Alex Conant. [That underlines the continuation of the Trump-led
metamorphosis of the Republican Party since he was voted out of the
White House in 2020, even as some party leaders seek to move the party
away from Trumpism, the strategists and analysts said. "I think the No.
1 thing Trump has absolutely changed in the party is that Republicans
don't even try playing nice anymore. My side has become more angry,"
said Republican strategist Chuck Warren]{.underline}. The people's 'Make
America Great Again' Trump's kingmaker status was put to the test this
month when several high-profile, [Trump-backed candidates faced
Republican primaries in Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia.
Around **two-thirds of high-profile candidates** backed by Trump
**triumphed** in their contests in May, although some were running
**unopposed or against weak challengers**. One race, the Republican
senate contest in Pennsylvania between television personality Mehmet Oz,
who received Trump's endorsement, and former hedge fund executive David
McCormick, has yet to be decided. In lobbying for the former president's
endorsement, both men cast aside their elite backgrounds to espouse the
Trump-style populism that now resonates with Republicans.]{.underline}
The primary was shaken up by Kathy Barnette, a conservative political
commentator, who came from nowhere at the 11th hour to tighten a race
that had until then appeared to be a two-man contest. [While she
finished a distant third in the primaries, analysts said she was
emblematic of how Trump's Make America Great Again movement has expanded
beyond his control. "MAGA does not belong to President Trump," Barnette
said during a Republican debate last month, even as Trump spoke out
against her. "Although he coined the word, MAGA actually belongs to the
people."]{.underline} Republican voters in Pennsylvania also backed
Trump-endorsed far-right candidate Doug Mastriano for governor, who
supports abortion bans with no exceptions and backs Trump's false claims
of election fraud. Mastriano won his contest. In North Carolina[,
**Republican voters powered Trump-backed Representative Ted Budd**, who
voted to overturn Joe Biden's election win, to victory in the state's
Republican Senate nomination. Georgia's governor's race, where Perdue
was pummeled on Tuesday by Kemp, shows how **the Republican Party has
shifted to the righ**t, irrespective of how Trump-endorsed candidates
perform in these primaries.]{.underline} While Kemp did not entertain
Trump's conspiracy theories of 2020 election fraud, he did enact
sweeping voting restrictions, limited abortions and expanded gun rights.
But voters were only willing to follow Trump so far in backing flawed
candidates in May's nominating contests[. In another race on Tuesday,
for Georgia's secretary of state position, some experts had forecast
neither securing a majority, triggering a run-off. Instead, incumbent
Brad Raffensperger narrowly defeated Trump-endorsed Rep. Jody Hice, who
**amplified Trump's baseless claims** that he actually won the Georgia
presidential vote in 2020]{.underline}. In North Carolina, voters ousted
scandal-plagued congressman Madison Cawthorn despite Trump's last-minute
plea to give him "a second chance." And in Nebraska, Trump's choice for
governor, Charles Herbster, lost amid accusations that he had sexually
harassed several women.

### U -- Inflation 

#### Rep are winning now, as more than half of Americans believe that the Dems aren't doing enough for inflations

issues, and attitudes toward government.

WASHINGTON --- Concerns about inflation and personal finances have
surged while COVID has evaporated as a top issue for Americans, a new
poll shows, marking an upheaval in priorities just months before
critical midterm elections. **[Forty percent of U.S. adults specifically
name inflation]{.underline}** in an open-ended question [as]{.underline}
one of up to five [prioritie]{.underline}s [for the government to work
on in the next]{.underline} year, according to a June poll from The
Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That\'s a
sharp rise from 14% in December and less than 1% the year prior. [In
all, 77% mention the economy in any way, up from 68% in December. But
just 10% specifically mention jobs or unemployment,]{.underline} as U.S.
employers continue to hire despite high inflation and weak economic
growth[.]{.underline} Now, too[, Americans]{.underline} [increasingly
call their personal finances a major issue: 44% mention]{.underline}
it[, up from 24% in December]{.underline} and 12% the year before. That
includes more mentioning gas or energy prices (33% now vs. 10% in
December) and food costs (9% vs. less than 1%). ACT NOW The poll of
1,053 adults was conducted June 23-27 using a sample drawn from NORC's
probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be
representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for
all respondents is plus or minus 4 percentage points. [Those shifts may
be advantageous to Republicans as they campaign to win control of
Congress in this year\'s midterms; the economy has increasingly been a
sore subject for President Joe Biden]{.underline}. Still, the economy
isn't the only issue getting more attention this year. Many also
prioritize issues that are core to Biden and Democrats' agenda,
including abortion, women's rights and gun policy, which could help
Democrats as they try to pad --- or at least protect --- their
razor-thin majority. In a troubling sign for both parties, the poll
finds many Americans say they think neither side of the aisle is better
at focusing on the issues important to them or getting things done. Sara
Rodriguez said she's concerned about the impact of rising prices of
goods, gas and oil on her household's finances, especially because her
income isn't keeping up. "We've had a savings built up and we're
noticing that it's definitely going down fast because we don't make
enough money to cover how much the cost of everything has risen," the
43-year-old quality control coordinator in Bristol, Connecticut, said.
Rodriguez and her husband and son have had to get to their workplaces
and run errands using one car over the last couple of months because of
her husband's broken-down truck. "We just haven't had the money to get
it back on the road," she said. The rise in concerns about the economy
is paired with a steep decline in the percentage naming COVID-19 as a
top issue, even as new variants continue to emerge: Now just 4% mention
it, down from 37% in December 2021 and 53% in December 2020.
[Republicans are more likely than Democrats to mention inflation or
personal finances as top issues]{.underline}, but the sharp changes
since December are bipartisan. Daniel Collier, a 39-year-old
construction worker in Waynesville, Missouri, thinks lowering gas prices
should be a priority. "It's hurt me financially," he said. "I worry
about being able to pay the rent, pay utilities." He blames Biden for
inflation and "poor" economic conditions, saying he thinks the president
is "incompetent." [The poll shows 69% of Americans disapprove of how
Biden is handling the economy, including]{.underline} 93% of Republicans
and [43% of Democrats. In May]{.underline}, facing an inflation rate at
a 40-year high, most Americans said in an AP-NORC poll that they worried
about the impact of higher than usual prices on their finances. For
22-year-old Jakyra Green, rising prices have been prohibitive.

[Republicans are starting to attract more voters in the working

wealthier Americans as midterm candidates make their priorities clear in
the last four months before the election. [The majority of voters

Democrat**. Minority voters are likely to see inflation as the
country\'s greatest concern, but the Democratic Party has made clear its
main priorities approaching the midterms are abortion, gun laws and
climate.**]{.underline} This type of agenda is likely to appeal more to
wealthier, suburban voters. [The two parties are neck and neck with
Hispanic voters]{.underline} on the generic congressional ballot after a
New York Times-Siena College poll discovered 41% said they would vote
Democrat and 38% Republican. **[During the 2018 midterm election cycle,
Democrats had a 47-point advantage among Hispanic voters, a number that
has significantly dropped since the election.]{.underline}** NBC News
conducted a poll this spring that found Democratic support among women
with college degrees is up 28 points since 2010, rising from 10 points
to 38 over the past decade. The party did not see a rise in any other
demographic. With inflation on the rise and hitting a 40-year high of
9.1% in June, these middle-class voters are taking the hit and will be
more likely to vote for a candidate this November who plans on making it
a priority to tackle the issue. [An Associated Press-NORC
poll]{.underline} released in early July [affirmed that most Americans\'
biggest concern is inflation, despite Democratic candidates centering
campaigns around abortion and gun laws]{.underline}.

The [president\'s party always loses seats in midterms]{.underline}.
This year, just about everything --- [fundraising, voter enthusiasm,
demographic shifts, the issues mix --- is going the right way for
Republicans]{.underline}. For Democrats this year, the only real
question is whether the elections will be only moderately bad or
completely terrible. If you think like a weather forecaster, all kinds
of data point to a major storm. By basically every metric you can think
of --- fundraising, candidate recruitment, voter enthusiasm, demographic
shifts --- a big wave is forming that will sweep hundreds of Democrats
out of office, up and down the ticket. The main reason isn't hard to
suss out. [Every president can count on his party losing seats in
midterms, but President Biden's approval ratings are particularly
bad]{.underline}. On average, 41 percent of Americans approve of the job
he's doing, compared with [54 percent]{.underline} who
[disapprove]{.underline}. "That is one of the [lowest marks of any
president since World War II]{.underline}," says Henry Olsen, a
conservative analyst at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. "Unless
that changes, I would expect a solid Democratic defeat." Granted,
President Donald Trump's approval ratings were similarly bargain
basement in 2018 --- but then, Republicans lost control of the House
that year, along with seven governorships. The more important
comparison, at any rate, is not with Trump but with Biden himself. Biden
won the presidency in 2020 by 4.5 points. [If he's down 13, that
represents a huge drop in support, which seriously imperils his party.
**Swing voters have swung hard against Biden**]{.underline}. His net
approval rating among independents is roughly minus 20. That's a group
he carried in 2020 by 13 points, according to exit polls. We've already
witnessed a demonstration of how the [president's numbers can drag down
other Democrats]{.underline}. Last November, [Biden's net disapproval
numbers were 12.5 percent points lower]{.underline} than his victory
margin in 2020. Guess what? The swing from Biden's share of the vote to
that won in 2020 by the Democratic candidates for governor was 12
points. Gov. Phil Murphy managed barely to hold on in New Jersey, but
[Democrat Terry McAuliffe lost the governorship to Republican Glenn
Youngkin in Virginia]{.underline} --- [a state Biden had carried a year
earlier by 10 points]{.underline}. Now, [Biden's numbers are even
lower]{.underline} than they were back in November. This means [any
Democrat who won their last election by less than double-digit margins
should be nervous.]{.underline} That certainly [includes]{.underline}
vulnerable governors such as [Tony Evers of Wisconsin and Laura Kelly of
Kansas.]{.underline} "The president's dismal ratings are what people
care about the most," says GOP consultant David Carney. "It could be a
bloodbath up and down the ballot, from the school board to Congress.\"

[Republicans **outnumber** Democrats in battleground Arizona, new
statistics show The GOP holds its largest registration edge in the state
since 2018.]{.underline} Democrats have flexed their political muscles
in Arizona in the last two election cycles, winning Senate and
presidential contests, and even threatening to primary Sen. Kyrsten
Sinema, D-Ariz., over her centrist positions. But [Arizona isn't a blue
state. Far from it.]{.underline} New [voter registration statistics from
the secretary of state's office, first reported by ABC15, show
Republicans outnumbering Democrats by nearly **4 percentage points**
among active voters, 34.5% to 30.9% --- or approximately 150,000
voters]{.underline}. It's the GOP's widest registration advantage in the
state since 2018, ABC15 adds. Unaffiliated voters represent 33.7% of the
state's active voters --- slightly behind the GOP but ahead of
Democrats. Here\'s the breakdown of July 2022 voter registration numbers
in the state per the Arizona Secretary of State (active voters):
Republican: 1,433,650 (34.5%) Other: 1,399,954 (33.7%) Democratic:
1,284,651 (30.9%) Libertarian: 32,506 (0.8%) Two developments have
helped Democrats win in Arizona --- first Sinema in 2018, then Joe Biden
and Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., in 2020 --- despite that GOP registration
advantage. One, Sinema (50%-47%), Biden (53%-44%) and Kelly (55%-45%)
all won the independent voters, according to NBC News' exit polls. And
two, all three candidates peeled off about 10% of Republican voters,
while holding on to almost all Democratic voters (96%-97%). Bottom line:
[Arizona is a purple state, where Democrats **need** independents and
disaffected Republicans to win --- in a state where the GOP holds the
registration advantage]{.underline}.

incumbent Brian Kemp despite former President Donald Trump endorsing his
challenger, former Senator David Purdue. Gov. Kemp garnered 73.7% of the
Republican vote.]{.underline} His victory sets up a rematch of the
highly contested 2018 race against Stacey Abra3ms, who ran unopposed on
the Democratic side. [In the race for U.S. Senate, Herschel Walker
easily secured the Republican nomination over a field of other GOP
candidates, including state Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black. Walker
was endorsed by former President Donald Trump shortly after announcing
his campaign. This sets up a clash with freshman Senator Raphael
Warnock]{.underline}, who cruised to victory in his Democratic primary.
This [race is poised to be crucial in deciding Senate
control]{.underline}. The redistricting of Congresswoman Lucy McBath's
district prompted her to run in the neighboring 7th congressional
district against Democratic colleague Carolyn Bourdeaux. McBath won the
Democratic primary contest with 64% of the vote. She will now face
either Michael Corbin or Mark Gonsalves in November's general election.
In the 6th district, the election for an open seat in Congress resulted
in a runoff on the Republican side. The winner will take on Democrat Bob
Christian in November. [The winner of the Republican primary will likely

Congress, 51% would pick the GOP and 41% a Democrat.]{.underline}
President Joe Biden's approval rating continued to remain low at 33%
compared to 60% who disapprove. Gov. Roy Cooper remained even in his
performance rating, with 44% approving and 44% disapproving.
Seventy-eight percent of respondents said Biden has "all" or "some"
responsibility for inflation. Eighty-nine percent said inflation in the
U.S. was "a huge problem." The trendline continues downward on sentiment
about whether the U.S. is headed in the right or wrong direction, with
22% saying right track and 72% saying wrong track. Seventy-seven percent
believe the U.S. is currently in a recession, with 13% saying the nation
is not. Asked which metric they believe most indicates whether the
country is in a recession, the runaway favorite was "prices of goods and
services" at 63%.

[Walker is likable and personable, with an air of authenticity that
helps him **connect**]{.underline} with voters. And this might just be
his "secret" formula for winning the election. "He is very raw," said
Republican voter Joe Cobb, an executive from suburban Atlanta. "He's
like, 'I've had mental issues' and that's hard for someone of his
stature to do. "[He's not a politician,"]{.underline} he added. "In this
day and age that [plays to your strengths]{.underline} and not being a
politician is Herschel's strength." Atlanta-based conservative radio
host Erick Erickson agrees. The [press, he said, doesn't "understand how
unsettled voters are over things like inflation, the border, crime, you
name it. Voters don't want to put the people back in office who caused
this, so they'll take a risk with the **outsider**]{.underline}." Walker
said that at every stage of his personal journey --- whether it be
football, business or politics --- he has prayed. Faith, he said, is a
cornerstone of everything he has achieved. When he decided to run for
Senate, he said he listened to both God and voters across the state.
"People were like, 'What?' I said, 'Yeah, I want to hear what the people
have to say, because when you go to Washington, you're supposed to
represent the people, not yourself.' " As he was going through his
listening sessions, Walker found that "70% of the drugs coming into the
United States goes through Atlanta, where you got human trafficking.
Fentanyl is killing, it's increasing crime, but yet we're not even
addressing it." In 2010 the DOJ reported that the Atlanta area is the
principal bulk cash consolidation center for Mexican drug-trafficking
organizations operating in the eastern US. More recently, the Georgia
Department of Public Health reported a 106% spike in fentanyl-related
deaths between May 2020 and April 2021. [Walker's positions will become
clearer when he eventually debates Warnock before the
election.]{.underline} Because he refused to debate his Republican
challengers in the primary, his performance will likely be heavily
scrutinized. But, despite his unconventional background and lack of
political experience, many Georgia political observers say [this is
Walker's race to lose come November. Sure, he may be a bit messy, but
"**everything** is working against the Democrats, **especially in
Georgia,"** said Erickson, who despite early reservations is now fully
behind Walker. "Spend some time in the state and you'll understand why
Warnock **is in trouble**."]{.underline} Walker feels the same way about
his face-off with Warnock. "As I told everyone," he said, "Guys, I know
I can beat this guy."

MADISON, Wis. (AP) --- [Wisconsin Democrats]{.underline} gathering for
their annual state convention this weekend are focused on reelecting
Gov. Tony Evers and defeating Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, but also
[know that history is **against them** in the midterm year and voters
face high inflation, rising gas prices and growing concerns about a
recession.]{.underline} The extent of how tight the election may be was
made clear Wednesday with the latest Marquette University Law School
poll. It showed Evers slightly ahead of his Republican challengers,
while Johnson about even with each of the top Democrats running against
him. But the [poll also showed Republicans are more excited than
Democrats about voting]{.underline}, a significant marker in a midterm
election when turnout is lower than in a presidential year. The prospect
for Johnson improved, and worsened for Evers, the lower the projected
turnout in the poll. ["Turnout **matters** in a game of inches in a
state that has had so many close elections in recent
years,"]{.underline} said Marquette pollster Charles Franklin. [And in a
bad sign for incumbents, a **majority** of poll respondents said they
felt the state was headed in the wrong direction.]{.underline} Evers and
Democrats know that the road ahead is a tough one --- the last time a
candidate for Wisconsin governor who was the same party as the president
won was back in 1990 --- but they believe they can overcome the
headwinds. 2022 MIDTERM ELECTIONS "Whatever else is happening
nationally, in Wisconsin Democrats are united and energized," said
Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler. Still, the Marquette
poll showed [67% of Republicans **were very enthused** about voting
compared with 58% for Democrats.]{.underline} "There's this real sense
that the future of our state and that the whole country is on the line
and that Democrats casting their ballots in 2022 could affect the rest
of all of our lives," Wikler said. The Marquette poll showed President
Joe [Biden's approval rating at 40%, with 57% disapproving, his
**lowest** marks in Wisconsin since taking office]{.underline}. Evers'
approval rating was better at 48% while 45% disapproved.

[Of all the things the Florida Democratic Party has going against it in
these midterm elections, voter registration looks like the most
**ominous**.]{.underline} It's not just the raw numbers, it's the trend
of political preferences[. Things are going **up** for the GOP and
**down** for the Democrats.]{.underline} Bottom line: A Republican
registration advantage of about 200,000 when the primaries are held next
month. Democrats have found some glimmer of hope in the Supreme Court's
abortion ruling. Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried encourages
Republican and independent voters to become Democrats, and has hammered
at U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist's past "pro-life" positions, in their race to
oppose Gov. Ron DeSantis this fall. [Abortion is hot right now, but
polls show inflation, gas prices and crime motivate **more** voters. And
most who care strongly about it**, either way**, were already going to
support the more liberal or conservative nominee in
November]{.underline}. Division of Elections charts indicate the
[Democrats held a lead]{.underline} of 97,215 statewide [two years ago.
But]{.underline} [by early 2021, the Republicans were on
top]{.underline} by 43,102. And as of May 1, that lead rose to nearly
176,000. [Over two years, total registration fell]{.underline} from 14.5
million to 14.2 million --- mostly due to people dying, moving away or
letting registration expire --- [but Republicans lost only 83,000 voters
while Democratic registration was down by **over 356,000**.]{.underline}
Republicans have run Florida since Gov. Jeb Bush beat Buddy MacKay in
1998, but it took a couple decades for registration to catch up with
voter performance. President Obama carried the state twice, but so did
Donald Trump in the most recent presidential races. The
[Democrats]{.underline}, already a stark minority in the state House and
Senate, [**didn't even field candidates** in several legislative races
this year.]{.underline} Not long ago, it was the GOP that let powerful
Democrats go unopposed or put up hopeless long shot candidates. If you
look at it like Ford vs. Chevy, or Coke vs. Pepsi, it seems [Floridians
just aren't buying what the Democrats are offering. A recent Monmouth
University poll pegged President Biden's approval rating at **36%**, so
there's no reason to think Democratic fortunes will rebound
soon.]{.underline} Inflation has driven up the prices of nearly all
goods and services, including necessary items such as groceries. The
cost of a gallon of milk is up 25% compared to pre-pandemic prices.
According to a report by Moody\'s Analytics, American families pay \$311
more each month, on average, for essential goods compared to one year
\[...\] Inflation, which the Biden White House called "transitory" last
year, is running 8.6%. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that
red states are far outpacing blue states in job recovery. [Since the
start of the pandemic, states run by Republicans have added 341,000 jobs
while those run by Democrats were still down 1.3 million in May. Those
aren't numbers that swing states into the red or blue column, but the
trend is a bragging point]{.underline}. Midterm elections are always bad
for the president's party. In 1994, President Clinton's first midterm
election, Republicans flipped eight seats in the Senate and 54 in the
U.S. House and gained 10 governors. In President Obama's first midterm,
2010, Republicans took over both chambers of Congress with a net gain of
63 seats. [The GOP will **surely** win the House this year]{.underline}
and the Senate is up for grabs. But there probably won't be such a
seismic shift this year --- not because the Democrats are strong, but
because the Republicans have nominated some bizarre people in other
states. So, [Florida is **no longer politically purple**]{.underline}.
As Politico said in its Florida Playbook last week, "DeSantis'
prediction that Florida will no longer be a battleground state after
this year's election is moving closer into view."

Poll tracker [FiveThirtyEight\'s 2022 election forecast rates the Senate
as a toss-up]{.underline} with Democrats defending 14 seats and
Republicans 21, but there is some room for Democratic gains. The
Pennsylvania Senate race is a toss-up as Republican Senator Pat Toomey
is retiring. If Democratic Lt. Governor John Fetterman can defeat
Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz, that will go a long way to holding the Senate.
Democrats could also make gains in potentially close races that
FiveThirtyEight rates as leaning Republican---Wisconsin and North
Carolina---and could even score an upset victory in Ohio. [However,
incumbent Democrats in close races will also have to win re-election if
the party hopes to maintain control of the Senate. FiveThirtyEight rates
the races in Georgia, Nevada and Arizona as toss-ups. All those seats
are currently held by Democrats. If everything goes right for Democrats
on election day, they could end up with 54 seats---still shy of the 60
votes needed to overcome the]{.underline} filibuster. This outcome seems
unlikely, however. [It\'s a different picture in the House of
Representatives, where Republicans are favored to win, according to
FiveThirtyEight\'s analysis.]{.underline} Democrats currently hold 220
seats to Republicans\' 210, while five seats are vacant. The
president\'s party will need 218 seats to keep the chamber[.
FiveThirtyEight argues that even if Democrats hold all their current
seats and win all the toss-up races, ]{.underline}[it will not be enough
to hand them the
majority](https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-worst-case-scenario-midterms-joe-biden-republicans-1722543)[.
A Democratic victory in the House appears to require a major shakeup in
the dynamics of the midterm elections.]{.underline} That is
possible---especially given likely ongoing controversy over abortion
laws and investigations into the role some Republicans played in efforts
to overturn the 2020 presidential election. [**The election could throw
up a so-called \"October surprise\" that changes the course of the race
in Democrats\' favor**, but right now that seems a distant
prospect]{.underline}. It also seems unlikely that neither chamber will
change hands. The last time that happened was in 1998, when Republicans
held both the House and Senate despite modest Democratic gains in the
House and some changes in the composition of the Senate.

#### Midterms are susceptible to sway

[Voters in seven states]{.underline} will [decide who controls the U.S.
Senate]{.underline} in 2023-24: [Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New
Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin]{.underline}. If
Republicans net even one seat in the fall midterms, they can block
President Joe Biden's judicial, diplomatic and executive branch
appointees for the rest of his term. While some of those seven states
have large populations --- Pennsylvania is the fifth most populous,
Georgia the eighth, North Carolina the ninth, Arizona the 14th,
Wisconsin the 20th, Nevada the 32nd and New Hampshire the 41st,
according to the 2020 census --- only a handful of voters in each state
will decide who wins their 2022 Senate races. That is because most
voters are reliably Republican or reliably Democratic. They may well
tell you that they are independents who cast their votes depending on
their evaluation of the candidates, but that is usually poppycock. Most
are closet partisans who vote consistently for one party or the other
but like the idea of being "independent." Since [each of the seven
states is almost evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, those
partisans generally don't decide who wins.]{.underline} **[It is true
swing voters --- "soft" Democrats, and "soft" Republicans in those
states who have the power to pick winners in any statewide
contest.]{.underline}** Traditionally, turnout in midterm elections is
significantly below that in presidential years, so part of the parties'
electoral calculations includes their ability to turn out voters who
otherwise would not show up at the polls in a typical midterm.

and 2021 and give the party a majority? That was the plan? Well, most of
it, yes. On Friday, President [Biden signed an executive order offering
some federal protections for abortion after the ruling, but otherwise,
that same mantra: **vote**]{.underline}. You need to vote. In short
order, though, frustration at the knee-jerk "it's up to you on Election
Day" crumpled a bit since, after all, Election Day is the point at which
voters can reshape the direction of the country. In the weeks after the
Dobbs verdict, some Democrats started to even get hopeful. [Would anger
at overturning Roe be enough to turn around the historic pattern of
midterm elections going against new presidents]{.underline}? Was that an
uptick in generic congressional ballot polling? Was enthusiasm surging?

Let's start with the generic ballot. This is a question pollsters use to
gauge how the House will look after an election, asking respondents
whether they plan to vote for the Democrat or Republican in their local
House contest, but not by name. This year, Republicans opened up a
healthy lead on this question, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling
average. [Since Dobbs, Democrats have inched up a bit --- 0.7 points, to

With exactly four months until the midterms, it is [[still the
**Republican Party** who is **expected to come out on top**]{.mark} in
November. Historically, the party controlling the White House is the one
that loses the most seats in the first midterm election of its
administration, a fact that doesn\'t bode well for President Joe
Biden.]{.underline} With [**[rising inflation, record-breaking gas
prices and Biden\'s continuously low approval ratings]{.mark}**, it has
been [**long predicted**]{.mark} that the [Democrats]{.mark} will [see
**particularly heavy losses this year**,]{.mark} raising the [potential
of]{.mark} them [**losing majority power** of both the House and the
Senate to the GOP]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} However, there have
been significant developments just in the past few weeks which may
drastically alter how people vote, including the ongoing January 6
hearings surrounding Donald Trump, and the Supreme Court vote to
overturn Roe v. Wade, triggering abortion bans and severe restriction in
several states across the country. With several weeks still to go before
the polls open, a number of [experts have suggested what the realistic
best case scenario for the GOP is,]{.underline} given the current
political and economic climate. Sean Freeder, an assistant professor of
political science at the University of North Florida, suggested that
[out of more than 450 congressional elections, only around six to 10
Senate races and 30-40 congressional House seats are
competitive]{.underline}. While [[Freeder expects]{.mark} the
**[GOP]{.mark}** to **[easily regain control of the
House]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it may be more difficult for the party to
take the Senate because of what he calls \"a slate of weak Republican
candidates\" such as Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, Herschel Walker in
Georgia, and hopefuls in Arizona and Wisconsin. \"It will ultimately
come down to framing by each party. Democrats want this election to be a
referendum on Trump and the Dobbs decision. Republicans want this
election to be a referendum on Biden and the economy,\" Freeder told
Newsweek. \"Best case scenario for Republicans: Young and/or leftist
voters, disillusioned, stay home, and independents focus on inflation
and the concern of a looming recession. [**[Republicans sweep]{.mark}**
the [winnable Senate **seats**]{.mark}**,** giving them **[54-46
control]{.mark}** of the Senate, and a 40 seat advantage in the
House.]{.underline} \"It would then be virtually impossible for
Democrats to then pass any major legislation in the period prior to the
2024 election.\" Dr. Bernard Tamas, associate professor of political
science at Valdosta State University, also suggested that the best case
scenario for [[Republicans would be winning around 50 seats in the
House]{.underline}]{.mark}, but only gain around four or five seats in
the Senate. \"Flipping 10 seats in the Senate seems out of reach, which
means that the Republicans are unlikely to gain a filibuster proof
majority,\" Tamas told Newsweek. \"Since the Republicans tend to vote as
a bloc (much more than Democrats), and since having a total of 60 seats
in the Senate seems unlikely, there might not be that much difference
between the Republicans doing either moderately well or extremely well
against the Democrats.\" However, Tamas suggested it may still be too
difficult to predict how the overturning of Roe V. Wade will influence
voters by the time of the midterms, despite polls suggesting a majority
of Americans disagree with the decision. \"This is partially because we
haven\'t faced a situation quite like this before, and partially because
we don\'t know what the abortion-related politics will look like in
November,\" he said. \"[[Midterm **elections are heavily influenced by
turnout**.]{.mark} Anger drives up turnout, and **[Republicans were the
angrier group]{.mark}**]{.underline} up until the Dobbs decision was
announced.\" Dawn Teele, associate professor of political science at
Johns Hopkins University\'s SNF Agora Institute, believes \"big symbolic
wins\" for people who have expressed anti-abortion views in the wake of
Roe W. Wade---such as Gov Greg Abbot in Texas, Walker in Georgia, and
J.D Vance in Ohio, all of whom have been endorsed by Trump---would be
considered a success for the GOP. However, David Niven, a political
science professor at the University of Cincinnati, believed that the
best case scenario for the Republicans is a \"triumph of mundane
frustrations\" in which [[people decide to vote for issues other than
abortion]{.mark}. \"Inflation. Gas prices. Concerns about the strength
of the economy]{.underline}. If [**[voters make up their minds at the
kitchen table while they\'re paying bills]{.mark}**,
[Republicans]{.mark} could [sweep back into control of the House and the
Senate]{.mark}]{.underline}---and maintain their advantage in
governor\'s races,\" Niven said.

WASHINGTON --- One constant from political figures in wartime is
insistence that they're not concerned about politics. Nonsense, of
course. [The domestic political impact of the war in
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} --- now in its third week --- [[has
**scrambled** the two parties' strategies]{.mark} going [in]{.mark}to
[this year's midterm elections. Both]{.mark} have started to [maneuver
for advantage]{.mark}.]{.underline} No one knows whether either side
will benefit come November --- [[a lot depends on]{.mark} how
[voters]{.mark} end up [perceiving]{.mark} the war's
course.]{.underline} But [for]{.underline} President Biden and the
[Democrats]{.underline}, who have been tracking toward a significant
defeat, [attention to a foreign crisis could provide a badly needed
**shakeup** of the campaign debate.]{.underline} An overwhelming issue
"As a general rule, Americans don't vote on foreign policy unless
American men and women are dying in a war, but [we've rarely had an
international event not involving the United States directly that has so
totally consumed our news and attention as the Russian invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}," said Republican pollster and strategist Whit
Ayres. "This war has become symbolic for the survival of democratic
regimes against authoritarian dictatorships," Ayres added. "That
symbolism has given it a much broader meaning." [A poll this week by
Navigator Research, a Democratic firm, found that [37% of American
voters said they were "very closely" following]{.mark} news from
[Ukraine]{.mark}, and nearly 8 in 10 said they were following it at
least somewhat closely --- high numbers for a foreign issue. National
security and [foreign policy]{.mark} had [jumped to the **top** of
American concerns]{.mark}, tied with jobs and the economy,
[**displacing** worries about]{.mark} the [coronavirus and
inflation,]{.mark} the poll found]{.underline}. [Amid that intense
focus, [Americans have clearly picked a side]{.mark} ---
**[overwhelmingly favoring the Ukrainians]{.mark}**.]{.underline} That
could be seen in Wednesday's House vote to suspend oil imports from
Russia, which passed 414-17 with just two of the chamber's most
left-wing Democrats, Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri and Ilhan Omar of
Minnesota, and 15 right-wing Republicans voting no. [That level of
attention makes [the Ukraine war]{.mark} the kind of event that [could
**significantly shift** U.S. politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Politics
isn't the most important thing right now," said Democratic strategist
Steve Schale, chief executive of the pro-Biden super-pac Unite the
Country. But, he added, since 1992, "the only two midterm elections that
were not absolute debacles for the incumbent president's party were held
during a window where there was something significant in the country
that reshaped the conversation." Those two were 1998, when voters
rejected Republican efforts to impeach President Clinton and Democrats
gained four seats, and 2002, when Republicans under President George W.
Bush gained seats in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror
attacks. Biden and the Democrats have a long way to go to emulate the
midterm successes those two presidents enjoyed. A new Wall Street
Journal poll released Friday continues to show Democrats trailing the
GOP as the party voters say they expect to back in November. But polls
have also shown an uptick in voters' assessments of how Biden is doing
his job. The change is just a few percentage points, but after nine
months of nearly steady decline, it's a welcome sign for the president.
[Ukraine has clearly contributed to the boost in Biden's ratings. A poll
by Morning Consult for Politico found this week, for example, that by
46% to 42%, voters approved of Biden's response to the crisis. Voters'
assessments of how Biden has dealt with Ukraine have improved
**notably** since last month and are also significantly higher than how
they assess his presidency overall.]{.underline} The shift comes
primarily from Democrats and independents; Republicans mostly remain
highly critical of Biden. The Navigator poll, however, did identify a
slice of Republicans, mostly moderately conservative men, who approve of
Biden on Ukraine even as they disapprove of his performance otherwise.
In any case, winning back wavering partisans and independent voters is a
key task for Biden right now, one that could be critical in the small
number of swing House districts and Senate elections in which the
midterms will be most intensely contested. [[If]{.mark} [voters]{.mark}
continue to [approve]{.mark} of Biden's response, [it could help with
one of his key problems]{.mark} --- the perception by many Americans
[that he's not a strong leader]{.mark}.]{.underline} For now, the war
has provided Democrats with at least a talking point to use on one of
their other problems --- the inflation that has swept through the U.S.
economy. White House officials have worked overtime in recent days to
blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for the increase in gasoline
prices, labeling it "Putin's price hike." So far, that message has shown
some traction, at least with Democratic partisans. A poll released
Wednesday by YouGov found that Democrats, by 59% to 10% blamed Putin
rather than Biden for the price increases. Republicans heavily blamed
Biden, while independents were closely divided. Gas prices in the first
nine months of Biden's presidency rose from a nationwide average of
\$2.38 per gallon to \$3.40, according to weekly data from the Energy
Department. Since the Russian attack on Ukraine, prices nationwide have
jumped to an average of \$4.10, with more increases likely. Large
majorities of Americans say they support the administration's decision
to ban imports of Russian oil, although it's anyone's guess whether that
support will persist as motorists continue to struggle with high prices.
[The House vote to support the import ban reinforces the polling on
another impact of the war --- the degree to which Republicans have
rejected former President Trump's favorable attitude toward
Putin.]{.underline} Two weeks ago, I wrote that initial reactions to the
war had isolated Trump. That trend has only deepened. "The brutality of
Putin's assault has made the judgment of Putin's apologists highly
suspect," said Ayres. Trump has repeatedly complimented Putin, including
referring to the Russian leader's rationale for the invasion as
"genius." [A [majority of Americans, including both Democrats and
independents, although not Republicans, view Trump as
"pro-Russia]{.mark}," but see Biden and both parties in Congress as
"pro-Ukraine," the Navigator polling found.]{.underline} The 15
Republicans who voted against the oil import ban included several of
Trump's most outspoken supporters, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor
Greene of Georgia, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Lauren Boebert of Colorado,
Paul Gosar of Arizona and Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, who in
recent remarks to supporters called Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky a "thug." Elsewhere in the GOP, however, even party leaders who
have strenuously avoided criticizing Trump, like House Minority Leader
Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield, have publicly split with his praise of
Putin. "I do not think anything's savvy or genius about Putin," McCarthy
said Wednesday when asked about Trump's comments. Neither McCarthy nor
the vast majority of Republican elected officials have explicitly
criticized the former president, but [[Ukraine could emerge as an
election **liability** for some]{.underline}]{.mark} of his acolytes.
The [first overt sign of that came this week in North Carolina, where
former Gov. Pat McCrory aired the first ad of his campaign for the
party's Senate nomination. The spot attacked his chief opponent, Rep.
Ted Budd, for being soft on Putin.]{.underline} The ad features a clip
from a television interview in which Budd called Putin a "very
intelligent actor." "These are serious times and we need serious
senators," McCrory says in the ad. "I don't compliment our enemies."
That was the first such use of Ukraine in a political attack in the
current campaign year, but "if the dynamics continue on this same
track," said Ayres, it almost surely will not be the last.

#### Russia is public enemy number 1, if it gets hurt, the plan will be popular.

Richard **Wike et al 22**, 4-6-2022, Doctorate in Political Sciences and
well-respected researcher, \"Seven-in-Ten Americans Now See Russia as an
Enemy,\" Pew Research Center,
https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/04/06/seven-in-ten-americans-now-see-russia-as-an-enemy/
-RayS

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to a dramatic shift in American
public opinion: [70% of Americans now consider Russia an enemy of the
United States,]{.underline} up from 41% in January. And on this topic,
[Democrats and Republicans largely agree, with 72% of Democrats and 69%
of Republicans describing Russia as an enemy.]{.underline} A new Pew
Research Center survey, conducted March 21-27, finds that just 7% of
U.S. adults have an overall favorable opinion of Russia. Only 6% express
confidence in its leader, President Vladimir Putin. In contrast, 72%
have confidence in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The ongoing
war has brought renewed attention to NATO. Ukraine is not a NATO member,
but it borders several member states, and NATO leaders have worked
together in recent weeks to coordinate their responses to the crisis.
[Attitudes toward the alliance have grown more positive since Russia's
invasion: 67% express a favorable opinion of the organization, up from
61% in 2021. Meanwhile, 69% say the U.S. benefits a great deal or a fair
amount from being a NATO member.]{.underline} While both [Democrats and
Republicans (including those who lean to each party) hold largely
positive views about NATO and U.S. membership in the organization,
Democrats are consistently more positive, especially liberal
Democrats]{.underline}. For instance, 85% of liberal Democrats think the
U.S. benefits a great deal or a fair amount from NATO membership; among
conservative Republicans, only 51% hold this view. Still, partisan
differences over NATO have shrunk somewhat over the past year. The share
of Democrats and Democratic leaners with a favorable overall opinion of
NATO has held steady at nearly eight-in-ten, but among Republicans and
GOP leaners, positive views have increased from 44% in spring 2021 to
55% today. The partisan gap on [Russia favorability has also
decreased]{.underline}. In 2020 -- the last time this question was asked
-- there was a 17 percentage point difference between the share of
Democrats with a very unfavorable opinion of Russia and the share of
Republicans with that view; now the gap is only 5 points. Democrats and
Republicans are also now more closely aligned on views about the threat
posed by Russia. In the current survey, 66% of Democrats and
Democratic-leaning independents say Russia is a major threat to the
U.S., similar to the 61% registered among Republicans and
Republican-leaning independents. However, when this question was last
asked in 2020, only 48% of Republicans considered Russia a major threat,
compared with 68% of Democrats. These are among the key findings of a
new survey conducted by Pew Research Center on the Center's nationally
representative American Trends Panel among 3,581 adults from March 21 to
27, 2022. Most Americans have a very unfavorable opinion of Russia
Public opinion of Russia is overwhelmingly negative: [**92%** of
Americans say they have an unfavorable view of the country, including
69% who have a very unfavorable view]{.underline}. Since the last time
this question was asked on Pew Research Center's online panel in 2020,
almost two years prior to Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine, this
strongly negative sentiment has increased by 28 percentage points.
Before switching to online surveys, Pew Research Center tracked
Americans' ratings of Russia in phone surveys between 2007 and 2020. In
that time, assessments of Russia were never very positive, but they
turned sharply negative in the spring of 2014, immediately following
Russia's annexation of Crimea, which few countries have recognized --
and never recovered. While [negative sentiment toward Russia has
increased substantially among both Democrats and Republicans since 2020,
Republicans' views have changed more drastically. Around a third of
Republicans and Republican leaners had a very unfavorable view of Russia
in 2020, compared with 67% who now hold this view -- a 35 percentage
point increase.]{.underline} In the same period, the [share of Democrats
with a very negative view of Russia increased by 23 points.]{.underline}
A small partisan gap in views of Russia remains, but Republicans and
Democrats are not as divided on Russia as they once were. Americans ages
65 and older (83%) are much more likely than adults under 30 (55%) to
have a very unfavorable view of Russia. A large majority of Americans
now see Russia as an enemy Changes in overall views of Russia have come
alongside changes in how Americans perceive relations between the two
countries. Just two months ago, Americans were more likely to describe
Russia as a competitor of the U.S. rather than its enemy (49% vs. 41% at
the time). Now, [Americans overwhelmingly call Russia an enemy: 70% say
so, with just 24% preferring to call Russia a competitor of the U.S.
Merely 3% of Americans see Russia as a partner, down from 7% two months
ago.]{.underline} While broad cross-sections of Americans primarily see
Russia as the United States' enemy, those ages 65 and older are
especially likely to hold this view, with 83% saying so. And while a
majority of the youngest adults polled agree that Russia is an enemy
(59%), they are far more likely than older adults to label Russia as a
competitor. More educated Americans are also particularly likely to name
Russia an enemy -- 77% of those with a postgraduate degree say this,
while roughly two-thirds of both those with some college education and
those with a high school degree or less education say the same. While
[Democrats and Republicans largely agree that Russia is an
enemy]{.underline}, there are some differences between partisan and
ideological camps. Moderate and liberal Republicans are the least likely
to name Russia an enemy (63% say this), while liberal Democrats are the
most likely (78%). Perception of Russia as a major threat at all-time
high With most Americans viewing Russia as an enemy, [the share who
believe that Russia is a threat to the U.S. is higher now than it has
ever been since the Center first began polling on this topic in 2008.
Overall, 64% of Americans say that Russia's power and influence is a
major threat to their country, 30% say it is a minor threat and only 5%
say Russia is not a threat.]{.underline} Mirroring overall views of
Russia, Americans became more wary of the country in 2014, when just
over half said it was a major threat to the U.S. At that time and in
2016, Republicans were more likely than Democrats to be concerned. This
partisan difference both widened and flipped in following years,
however, with Democrats much more likely than Republicans to view Russia
as a major threat in each survey between 2017 to 2020. Since then, the
share of Republicans who see Russia as a threat has increased, narrowing
the partisan gap. Though views of Russia as a major threat have shifted
somewhat over time, the share of Americans who say Russia is not a
threat to U.S. interests has never been higher than 10%. Majorities of
adults in all age groups see Russia as a significant threat, but this
view is even more common among adults ages 65 and older (70% vs. 57%
among those ages 18 to 29). Amid Russia-Ukraine war, Americans positive
on NATO, though partisan divides persist [As NATO faces increased
scrutiny in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the political and
military alliance is seen in a positive light by most Americans.
Two-thirds have a favorable opinion of NATO.]{.underline} This marks a
significant increase from the roughly six-in-ten who said the same of
the organization in 2020 and 2021. Prior to 2020, U.S. opinion of NATO
was somewhat mixed. Roughly half or more of Americans expressed a
favorable view of the organization, with opinion ranging from 49% in
2013 and 2015 to 64% in 2018. However, these figures are from phone
surveys and are not directly comparable to more recent online American
Trends Panel data. While [Democrats and Republicans are both generally
more favorable toward NATO than not, Democrats and Democratic-leaning
independents are more likely than Republican counterparts to have a
positive view]{.underline}. About eight-in-ten (78%) Democrats see NATO
in a positive light, compared with 55% of Republicans. This pattern was
observed in 2021, though Republicans have grown somewhat more favorable
on NATO since this question was last asked.

It turns out that [large majorities of Americans ar]{.underline}e indeed
[following the Russian invasion]{.underline} closely, according to our
University of Maryland Critical Issues Poll. The poll was carried out
online between March 16 to 28, 2022 by Nielsen Scarborough, who used a
nationally representative sample of 1,320 adults with a margin of error
of +/- 2.7%. It found that [40% of respondents say they are following
the crisis "very closely," and another 45% say they are following
somewhat closely]{.underline}. Here are twelve takeaways: 1 Americans
clearly [view Ukraine as being far more friendly than
Russia]{.underline}, even if most Americans don't simply consider Russia
to be an enemy or Ukraine to be a full ally. [Thirty-four percent of
respondents say Russia is an enemy]{.underline}, including 30% of
Republicans and 40% of Democrats, while 38% say Russia is an "unfriendly
country," and 24% say it is neither friendly nor unfriendly. Nineteen
percent consider Ukraine an ally, while a slight majority of [54%
consider Ukraine a "friendly country]{.underline}," and 25% consider it
neither friendly nor unfriendly. 2 Large [bipartisan majorities remain
opposed to sending U.S. troops to Ukraine]{.underline}, even if the
conflict persists. Sixty-five percent oppose sending troops, including
68% of Republicans and 62% of Democrats. At the same time, [a large
majority, 83%, supports supplying the Ukrainian army with military
equipment, including 82% of Republicans and 86% of
Democrats]{.underline}. Similarly, 89% of those polled support
continuing to impose tough sanctions on Russia, including 85% of
Republicans and 95% of Democrats. 3 If the Russian invasion persists,
small bipartisan majorities will support a no-fly zone over Ukraine,
even as large majorities of Americans express concern about the
possibility of fighting Russians and of nuclear conflict. Fifty-six
percent of respondents say they support enforcing a no-fly zone over
Ukraine, including 52% of Republicans and 61% of Democrats. Despite this
view, most respondents also expressed overwhelming concern about
potential U.S. military confrontation with Russia (61% were "very"
concerned and another 28% were "somewhat concerned"). [Nuclear fears
also weighed heavily: 58% were also "very concerned" and another 24%
"somewhat concerned" about potential nuclear confrontation with
Russia]{.underline}. 4 [Americans view the]{.underline} [U.S. response
to the Ukraine crisis more favorably than unfavorably]{.underline} but
are divided in their attitude along party lines. Forty-nine percent say
their opinion of the U.S. reaction has been favorable, including 31% of
Republicans and 69% of Democrats, compared to 31% who express
unfavorable opinions, including 49% of Republicans and 13% of Democrats.
A further 20% express neither favorable nor unfavorable opinions. Most
Americans, 51%, say the U.S. reacted at the "appropriate level," but a
majority of Republicans, 56%, say the U.S. has "underreacted."
Two-thirds of Americans support U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to
end importing Russian energy, including 56% of Republicans and 80% of
Democrats. 5 [Most Americans, including majorities of Democrats and
Republicans, say they are prepared to pay some price in energy costs and
inflation for supporting Ukraine,]{.underline} but not in American
lives. Seventy-three percent say they are at least somewhat prepared to
pay higher energy costs, including [88% of Democrats and 58% of
Republicans, while 65% are at least somewhat prepared to see increased
inflation, including 78% of Democrats and 51% of
Republicans]{.underline}. At the same time, 68% of Americans are "not at
all" (41%) or "not much" (27%) prepared to accept loss of lives of U.S.
troops. This holds across the partisan American divide, but Republicans
are much more likely to "not at all" accept casualties (47%), compared
to Democrats (33%). 6 [U.S. policy toward Ukraine has impacted the
public perceptions of Biden and former President Donald Trump more
negatively than positively, driven by highly partisan
attitudes]{.underline}. [Thirty-six percent say they now have more
favorable views of Biden]{.underline}, 23% say their views are
unaffected, while 41% say they have more negative views, including 80%
of Republicans. Thirty-four percent say they now have more positive
views of Trump, 26% say their views were unaffected, while 40%,
including 72% of Democrats, say they have more negative views of Trump.
7 Although [U.S. government messaging on Ukraine has been partly focused
on defending democracy around the world]{.underline}, most [Americans
across the partisan divide don't believe the U.S. is now a good model
for democracy]{.underline}. Only 27% say that democracy in the U.S. is a
good example for other countries to follow, including 28% of Democrats
and 29% of Republicans. A large majority, 61%, say the U.S. "used to be
a good example but has not been in recent years", including 64% of
Republicans and 58% of Democrats. 8 [Americans are divided on whether
their country should be leading the international opposition to the
Russian invasion, with 47% saying the U.S. should be the one to lead
(42% of Republicans and 55% of Democrats), while 53% say it should not
(58% of Republicans and 45% of Democrats).]{.underline} 9
Overwhelmingly, [Americans across the partisan divide blame Russia for
the crisis and few blame Ukraine]{.underline}. At the same time, a
significant percentage also blame the U.S. Ninety-eight percent say
Russia is to blame, 29% say Ukraine bears at least some of the blame,
and 36% say the U.S. bears at least some of the blame, including half of
Republicans. 10 While Americans say NATO's expansion played a role in
Russian behavior, [most don't think this was the key to Russia's
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. Thirty-eight percent say the expansion
of NATO played a key role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 41% say
NATO expansion played "a small but not a key role," while 21% say it
played no role. 11 Most Americans (57%) say the post-Cold War era has
ended[. Among those who hold that view, most blame Russian behavior, but
a smaller majority also blame American behavior]{.underline}. Ninety-two
percent say Russian behavior contributed to the demise of the post-Cold
War era (64% say "a lot" and 28% say "somewhat"), while 73% say American
behavior contributed (30% say "a lot" while 43% say "somewhat").

square in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, [killing
hundreds]{.underline}. In response to the invasion, [a loose coalition

which [include]{.underline}s G-7 members, [NATO allies]{.underline},
rich countries such as Japan and developing countries such as Ghana and
even traditionally neutral countries such as Switzerland and Monaco.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden will "[talk about the
steps we've taken to not only support the Ukrainian people with military
and economic assistance, but also the steps he's taken to build a global
coalition imposing crippling financial sanctions on President Putin, his
inner circle and the Russian economy."]{.underline} Biden will also
address "the [importance of the United States as a leader in the world

the most immediate threat]{.underline}. At the same time, Biden's
secretaries of state and defense have requested and distributed
[hundreds of millions of dollars worth of additional weapons to
Ukrainian troops and humanitarian aid to refugees fleeing the front
lines. This combined U.S. military, diplomatic, economic and
humanitarian response has earned praise for Biden from both Democrats

President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)\'s early
China strategy, as the [party considers how to push the new
administration toward a tougher line on Beijing]{.underline} and punish
it if it fails. The 120-member Republican Study Committee released a
briefing document on Tuesday summarizing Biden\'s approach to China as:
\"Bad policies, bad personnel.\" The group, chaired by Indiana Rep. Jim
Banks, is the largest conservative caucus in the House. Banks has said
he plans to use its clout to influence China policy. The committee
lauded Biden\'s predecessor [Donald
Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump)[ as \"the first
president to take on Communist China in a generation,\" holding Beijing
to account \"for stealing U.S. intellectual property, infiltrating the
U.S. education system, hijacking international organizations and
spreading disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.\"]{.underline}
[Long-term concerns about Chinese behaviour converged under
Trump]{.underline}, prompting bipartisan agreement that [Beijing
represents a problem to be addressed.]{.underline} Previous
administrations had hoped that engaging with the Chinese Communist Party
would encourage a more liberal regime while swelling U.S. coffers. But
Beijing used its new-found wealth and influence to entrench its
authoritarianism at home and push for new territory and power abroad.
[The CCP is unapologetic about its ]{.underline}[human rights
abuses](https://www.newsweek.com/biden-confronts-xi-taiwan-unfair-trade-trump-tariffs-review-looms-1568478)[ and ]{.underline}[assertive
in its territorial
disputes](https://www.newsweek.com/xi-jinping-wants-emulate-mao-thinks-u-s-will-back-down-taiwan-ex-australia-pm-1569546)[.
Its attempts to dodge blame for the coronavirus pandemic have also
rankled with democracies worldwide.]{.underline} On the campaign trail,
Biden vowed to be tough on China, seeking to dodge allegations from
Trump and other critics that he would return to a softer, more
cooperative relationship with Beijing. \"The Biden administration has
already taken a number of disastrous steps to undo President [Trump\'s
success in countering China]{.underline},\" the Republican Study
Committee claimed in its memo. \"The [Biden team so far has exhibited a
pattern of weakness]{.underline} and a return to Obama\'s failed
approach [of engaging rather than holding China accountable for its bad
behavior.]{.underline} \"The Biden administration\'s foreign policy team
is overwhelmingly made up of a number of individuals who either have had
links to the CCP, or have a record of weak statements and actions on
confronting it.\" \"Despite tough talk on China, such as Secretary
Blinken saying that [Trump was right to take a tougher approach to
China]{.underline}, the Biden administration\'s actions have shown they
will do the opposite,\" the committee said. Not
all [Republicans](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republicans) are taking
such a combative stance. In
the [Senate](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/senate), some GOP members
are looking to build bridges with the Biden White House to create a
bipartisan Beijing strategy. Anger at Chinese trade practices, human
rights abuses, territorial expansion and propaganda output were one of
the few things that united the two parties during Trump\'s term. With
Washington, D.C. still divided, this may be one of the few flags around
which both parties can rally in the coming years. After Biden\'s first
call with President [Xi
Jinping](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/xi-jinping), Senator Jim Risch
of Idaho---the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee---told Newsweek he was encouraged by the president\'s mention
of human rights abuses and other American grievances. \"I am glad to see
that President Biden increasingly views China as a serious competitor to
the United States, and that he raised Taiwan, coercive economic
practices and human rights,\" Risch said. \"I\'m also encouraged by the
China policy review currently underway at the Department of Defense.
COVID-19 has taught us that the Chinese Communist Party is willing to
undermine global health to preserve its standing, and that fact demands
a cautious approach towards pursuing cooperative initiatives with China,
whether on climate change or other issues.\" Whether their approach is
combative or cooperative, [Republicans are set to keep the pressure on
Biden and his team. The party saw China as ]{.underline}[a vote
winner](https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-want-china-define-2020-election-securing-victory-trump-1526651)[ in
last year\'s election. The economic impact of the pandemic, concerns
over globalization and the decline of U.S. manufacturing, plus
traditional worries about military hegemony, are a potent
combination]{.underline}. Add to this the increasingly well-publicized
human rights [abuses in
Xinjiang](https://www.newsweek.com/uyghurs-wait-nervously-biden-china-policy-genocide-continues-1553155) and
Hong Kong. \"China must be our top foreign policy priority,\" Risch
said, adding that he had introduced the STRATEGIC Act, which calls for a
clear strategy for competing with Beijing and coordinating with allies
in Europe. \"I plan to conduct congressional oversight of the Biden
administration\'s China policy and strategy for the entire Indo-Pacific
region,\" Risch said. \"The challenges China poses are an American issue
and I expect the Biden administration and
Congressional [Democrats](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democrats) to
work across the aisle on effective, concrete and politically sustainable
policies that have the support of the American people.\"

#### Republicans resilient on China -- basis of midterm GOP ads

[Criticism of China is emerging as a popular topic in this year's
midterm congressional campaign ads]{.underline}, especially in Rust Belt
states where the loss of manufacturing jobs to Asia and elsewhere have
placed economic stress on voters. Television ads mentioning China---some
of which have drawn criticism from Asian-American groups---are running
most heavily in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Some of
that can be attributed to the timing of primaries: Ohio's is Tuesday,
followed by Pennsylvania and West Virginia later in May, while
Wisconsin's is Aug. 9. [Roughly one in nine ads aired so far this year
in all House and Senate races have mentioned China]{.underline}, a Wall
Street Journal analysis of broadcast-television and national cable data

[mentions of
inflation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-gets-a-starring-role-in-gop-congressional-campaign-ads-11648373402?mod=article_inline),
another topic Republicans are especially eager to talk about.Of the
almost 34,000 airings that have touched on China, [more than 80% were
sponsored by Republicans or conservative-leaning groups.]{.underline}
The [U.S. wants to counter China's influence around the world by

has a lot of power." [Criticism of China was a
staple](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-campaign-targets-china-and-portland-not-just-biden-11595649660?mod=article_inline)
of former President [Donald

There are incentives for criticism of the Asian giant: Nearly
three-quarters of voters in [a Wall Street Journal
poll](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-poll-biden-ukraine-inflation-midterms-11646975533?mod=article_inline) in
March said China was the nation's largest economic threat, while a 52%
majority said it presented the biggest security threat. Ohio and
Pennsylvania, where China-related ads have run most frequently so far,
are hosting two of the most contentious U.S. Senate primaries on the GOP
side. The two states have also easily recorded the most spending so far
this year on political ads. The top campaign sponsor so far this year of
TV ads mentioning China is celebrity surgeon Mehmet Oz. As part of his
effort to win [Pennsylvania's Republican
primary](https://www.wsj.com/articles/dr-oz-hedge-funder-david-mccormick-flood-pennsylvania-airwaves-in-negative-ads-11650979639?mod=article_inline) for
U.S. Senate, he has aired more than 8,300 spots that have mentioned
China. Scoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ\'s
D.C. bureau. In one that has been running in five Pennsylvania media
markets, the Oz campaign calls his leading opponent, David McCormick,
the former chief executive of hedge-fund giant Bridgewater Associates,
"pro-China" and cites that as a reason Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Oz. Asked
last week in a debate to respond to attack ads claiming he has profited
from China, Mr. McCormick sought to minimize his dealings there and said
he had "done business around the world in 20 countries, including 2% of
our b[usiness in
China](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ray-dalios-bridgewater-raises-1-25-billion-for-its-largest-china-fund-yet-11637759912?mod=article_inline).
Mr. Oz's campaign-ad mentions of China are more than double the number
of airings for the next closest candidate, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan of
Ohio. Mr. Ryan, now seeking his party's endorsement for Senate, has cast
the U.S. relationship with China in stark terms. "It is us versus
China," Mr. Ryan says in [a recent
ad](https://twitter.com/TimRyan/status/1508795783210016772?s=20&t=XIY_xRd6KQZ7dFD2ibM4xg).
"[America can never be dependent on communist China."]{.underline} Mr.
Ryan's ad drew criticism from the AAPI Victory Fund, a super
political-action committee that aims to mobilize Asian-American and
Pacific Islander voters. In [a
statement](https://twitter.com/AAPIVictoryFund/status/1509582488355721225),
the group described the spot as "rife with sinophobic rhetoric" and
called for an end to such language at a time when hate crimes against
Asian-Americans are on the rise.

### L - Emerging Tech

#### They also want to hammer Biden for lack of action on emerging tech

**Gould 21** \[Joe Gould. \"23 Republicans urge Biden to work with
allies on tech to combat China\". 1-28-2021. Defense News.

6-23-2022.\] - AL

WASHINGTON ― [Nearly two dozen Republican lawmakers are calling on
President Joe Biden to engage with allies on emerging
technologies]{.underline} like 5G networking and artificial intelligence
**[in the face of China's advancements.]{.underline}** House Armed
Services Committee ranking member Mike Rogers, House Foreign Affairs
Committee ranking member Mike McCaul, and House Science, Space and
Technology Committee ranking member Frank Lucas signed a letter to Biden
urging him to maximize alliances to counter "China's vision for tech
authoritarianism and protect our own economic and national security
interests." The message to Biden signals an avenue for bipartisan
cooperation, just days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken appeared
supportive of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's efforts to forge a
D-10 group of democracies ― South Korea, India and Australia, plus the
G-7 nations ― to cooperate on 5G and vulnerable supply chains. In his
confirmation hearing last week, Blinken said: "Bringing concerned
countries together, the digital democracies together in an appropriate
forum, is the place to start." "I don't want to minimize the challenge.
We obviously have disagreements among democracies about a lot of
profound questions about how technology is used, so we've got some work
to do just to get our own collective house in order," he said. Western
allies, under pressure from President Donald Trump, agreed to exclude
Chinese tech giant Huawei from their 5G networks, claiming an espionage
risk, something the company has denied. Since then, the European Union
signed a long-promised investment deal with China last month despite the
public concerns from the incoming Biden administration. The [Republican
lawmakers]{.underline}, referencing Johnson in their letter,
**[recommended raising the issue of China's tech authoritarianism
through the G-7 and NATO]{.underline}** ― but also expanding engagements
with allied democracies, and creating and hosting new international
groups dedicated to democratic cooperation on technology. They also
called for the development of an allied network to encourage cooperation
among companies in allied states to scale emerging technologies, and for
the U.S. to help allies establish governmental bodies like the Committee
on Foreign Investment in the United States to review foreign investments
and prevent the transfer of allied technologies. McCaul, who chaired the
House's Republican-only China Task Force, [called on Biden to prioritize
investments in domestic manufacturing of next-generation semiconductor
chips in his expected infrastructure plan. McCaul has sponsored
legislation to boost funding for basic research.]{.underline} "We must
work with our allies to ensure that our supply chain is secure and the
future of technology is safely out of the hands of the \[Chinese
Communist Party\]," McCaul said in a statement. Democratic lawmakers
have also raised alarms over China's development of emerging
technologies. After a report last month that Huawei tested AI software
that could recognize Uighur minorities and alert police, Democratic Sen.
Bob Menendez, the incoming Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman,
tweeted the following: "A shocking reminder that #China continues to
flout the ethical development of emerging technologies. The US must lead
an effort with our allies to ensure the proper use of the digital domain
predicated on the values of openness, stability, security, & protection
of human rights."

### L -- Democracy

#### Democracy initiatives are a winner -- it helps Biden rejuvenate image. 

**Herndon & Cohn 7/13** (Astead & Nate, The New York Times, "Could the
Midterms Be Tighter Than Expected?" The Daily, July 13th, 2022,
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/podcasts/the-daily/midterms.html?showTranscript=1)

So we have a poll that shows, on the one hand, better overall polling
for Democrats in this moment than we might expect. But they also have
these very serious political challenges that they're facing, including
an unpopular president and a voter coalition that shows real signs of
erosion. What is the path forward here for Democrats? Are candidates
supposed to go to voters and say, hey, you don't like the president, but
you should like me instead? Nate Cohn Well, in the short term, [they
don't have too many other cards to play. Joe Biden is unpopular. The
economy is not in a great place.]{.underline} **[Unless the president
can figure out a way to rejuvenate his political
standing]{.underline}**, get costs under control, help the economy, and
so on, [it's hard to see them getting out of that fundamental
problem.]{.underline} So in the meantime, [they happen to have three
solid issues that appeal to a really important part of their base in
**democracy,**]{.underline} abortion, and gun control. And it's worth
noting that, [in a midterm environment, that can get you pretty
far]{.underline}. [The midterm elections are lower turnout. The
electorate tends to be better educated.]{.underline} More ideologically
consistent voters are likelier to show up in that sort of election.

I\'m not using the candidate\'s name. The TV spot starts with one of the
most dramatic and best-known soundbites in American history: the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, proclaiming,
\"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by
the content of their character.\" The ad then switches to the candidate,
dressed smartly but casually \-- not in a fleece vest, though! \-- and
sitting in front of a blackboard in a school classroom. He looks into
the camera. \"I want an America where every child learns those words and
what they mean,\" the candidate says. \"That\'s why I was shocked when
my opponent and other Republicans in our state voted for a bill that
would keep American heroes like Martin Luther King \[picture of King on

into some Stone Age of white supremacy is missing a golden opportunity
[to push a message that connects with a majority of
Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} We all know the conventional
wisdom about what is certain to happen when the nation votes in
November. The historical precedent is that the party holding the White
House gets clobbered, as happened to Donald Trump in 2018 and Barack
Obama in 2010 \-- [a notion now cemented by President Biden\'s low
approval rating and voter unease over high levels of
inflation.]{.underline} Yet often the lofty conventional wisdom fails to
notice changes at ground level. The post-2020 Census reapportionment
process that was supposed to give an added edge to Republicans didn\'t
actually do that. More important, the current political zeitgeist is
radically different than it was during 2021 s off-year elections in
Virginia, Florida, and other states. For one thing, the [news is
[dominated by]{.mark} shock and [outrage over]{.mark} Vladimir
[Putin\'s]{.mark} barbaric [invasion of Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} \--
a constant reminder of Donald Trump and other top Republicans who spent
years as Putin apologists, or worse, as well as the risks of
authoritarianism over democracy. But perhaps more important, Republicans
who saw some gains last year running against

that addresses racism or LGBTQ rights now seem guilty of a major
overreach. The extent of that GOP overreach can be seen both in the
sheer number of bills that Republicans are introducing in statehouses
across America \-- so-called gag orders about what teachers can say in
their classrooms \-- at a rate of roughly three a day, according to PEN
America, as well as outrageous local examples, like the Tennessee school
board that pulled the anti-Holocaust graphic novel Maus out of the
curriculum. [Now, [there is polling evidence that]{.mark} most
[Americans don\'t like what]{.mark} [they are
seeing]{.mark}.]{.underline} Last month, a CBS News poll found
resounding majorities of voters oppose any kind of book bans \-- for
example, 83% say that books should never be banned for criticizing U.S.
history \-- and also support classroom teaching about racism or other
historical topics, even those with the potential to make some students
uncomfortable. Basically, the CBS News respondents acknowledged that
America has made some progress on racial issues but also believe that
racism persists and that these issues should be discussed in classrooms.
That\'s very much the opposite of what TV pundits are saying, as well as
the trend of GOP governing in the nation\'s red states. There is a
tendency, or course, to write off polling data on sensitive topics
around race. Aren\'t there some voters who say one thing to a pollster

of the fight over antiracism education, Virginia\'s new Republican
governor, Glenn Youngkin. Taking office in January, Youngkin surprised
voters with some of his extreme actions, which including a Day One
executive order aimed at eliminating \"divisive concepts\" from
classrooms, and even a tip line for parents to report on their kids\'
teachers. The result? After little more than a month in office, Youngkin
is already under water, with just 41% of Virginians approving of his
performance and 43% disapproving. [[War in Ukraine]{.mark} demands that

there\'s [an opportunity]{.mark} here [for Democrats.]{.mark} The
[party\'s inclination]{.mark} in recent times [is to go after voters

#### Any of Biden's accomplishments can distract voters from inflation crisis -- Biden looking to use plan as pivot

path]{.underline} on the best way [for the White House to grapple with
an economic phenomenon]{.underline} that's been more severe and lasted
longer than officials expected. Unfortunately for [Biden and
Democrats]{.underline}, the lesson from the 1970s and '80s is that US
presidents are quite limited in what they can do on their own to tamp
down price pressures. [In the approach to November's midterm elections,
Ron Klain, Biden's chief of staff, has argued that the president and his
allies should talk more about the president's accomplishments,
especially the remarkable ]{.underline}[rebound in

[Inflation is a global problem, but the rate of inflation has been
higher in the United States than in Europe.]{.underline} Economists
generally point to skyrocketing demand since the introduction of

added to the problem. [Voters are not pleased with how either party is
handling the inflation debate, but Democrats, who hold the presidency

economy.]{.underline} A major problem? Democrats aren't sure what they
can do. Biden plans to travel to Iowa on Tuesday to announce a new EPA

summer ― normally they are allowed to sell up to 10% because of
pollution concerns ― which should help ease demand and lower prices for
gasoline. He has also worked to uncork supply chains at ports and in the
trucking industry. Biden has already announced plans to release 180
million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and has
worked to battle consolidation in the agriculture industry to bring down
food prices. [The White House has also repeatedly pointed to
policies]{.underline} included in the Build Back Better package that
Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) killed late last year ― giving Medicare the
power to negotiate prescription drug costs, providing subsidies for
child care ― [as possible solutions.]{.underline} But the chances of
resurrecting portions of the package remain somewhere between
nonexistent and murky.

While millions have been captivated by the dramatic testimony in the
congressional hearings into the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection in
Washington, D.C., Western officials are looking ahead to how threats to
democratic processes, particularly elections, may unfold in advance of
the 2022 midterm elections. In particular, officials from the Department
of Homeland Security ([[DHS]{.mark}) have [issued warnings]{.mark} that
[Russia]{.mark} is [seeking to exploit real or perceived election
irregularities]{.mark} to sow [doubts about the legitimacy of democratic
systems.]{.mark}]{.underline} According to media reports, such efforts
may include [small-scale hacks of local election authorities, designed
to draw notice, and then the exploitation of the discovery of those
cyber intrusions to raise doubts about the legitimacy of election
results]{.underline}. Such tactics will complement and amplify
**[[conspiracy theories]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [promoted by former
President Donald Trump and his followers, that \"the system is rigged\"
and unfair.]{.underline} For Russia to [engage in these tactics would
r[epresent]{.mark} another [evolution]{.mark} in its overall
[**strategy** to **undermine confidence in Western democratic
systems**]{.mark}]{.underline}---a strategy that has come a long way
since 2016. At that time, Russia sent human sources to gather
information about the U.S. political system---to find ways to support
Trump\'s presidential campaign using social media. This activity was
bolstered through a \"hack and dump\" effort, where Russian-backed
actors broke into the accounts of Democratic Party officials in order to
\"leak\" their data in ways that amplified conspiracies around the party
and Hillary Clinton. These \"**[[malinformation\"
campaigns]{.mark}]{.underline}** (whereby malicious actors use
\"information that stems from the truth but is often exaggerated in a
way that misleads and causes potential harm\") have evolved. In 2017,
[Russian-backed hackers obtained access to 9 gigabytes of
then-presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron\'s documents and published
them on the internet]{.underline}. However, this time the **[[hackers
were more ambitious in their approach]{.mark},]{.underline}** seeking to
[[plant fake information within the stolen
messages]{.underline}]{.mark}. That \"information\" included fraudulent
claims that Macron held offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands to evade
taxes. Other countries have also raised concerns that Russia (and other
authoritarian states) no longer seek to sway elections for particular
candidates but are instead engaged in a long-term strategy of
discrediting democratic institutions. By doing so, they likely [aim to
increase dysfunction and division within Western countries and lessen
the appeal of democracy worldwid]{.underline}e.However, the recent [[DHS
warning is]{.mark} so far the [most specific]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
may reflect an effort to \"prebunk\" the threat---that is, to [call out
malicious behavior before it occurs to disrupt it or mitigate its
impact]{.underline}. In addition, it\'s important not to overplay the
\"Russian bot\" narrative. Humans have agency and are more likely to be
swayed by domestic actors and influencers than by anonymous social media
accounts. However, online disinformation [**[networks have
developed]{.mark}** over the last decade, many fed by Russian-amplified
**[antisemitic, anti-LGBTQ+, anti-immigrant and anti-globalist
conspiracy theories]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a growing [far-right
media ecosystem and political actors have adopted these
narratives]{.underline}, they have become more potent. Given Trump\'s
continuing loud championing of the idea that the 2020 election was
stolen, we can expect domestic actors in Western countries to adopt
these narratives should a Russian hack (deliberately or not) be
discovered. Accordingly, election officials will have to be prepared to
be as transparent as possible with the public and to issue warnings in
advance of and possibly during elections. [[Governments need to]{.mark}
do their best to **[secure election systems]{.mark}** and the networks
behind them to [try to **prevent hacks**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
first place. [Social media companies, many of which have a very mixed
track record in dealing with misinformation, disinformation and
malinformation on their platforms, will need to look for coordinated
inauthentic activity promoting false narratives.]{.underline} Finally,
and most concerning, [governments will need to prepare for increasing
attack]{.underline}s, some violent, on democratic and other societal
institutions. In recent weeks there has been media reporting documenting
the abuse of election workers in the United States who are seen as part
of a great conspiracy to steal elections. A Reuters [investigation found
more than 100 examples of threats of death or violence to election
workers by Trump supporters, resulting in only four
arrests.]{.underline} While this abuse is disturbing on its face, it has
a **[wider impact:]{.underline}** These threats may make [it hard to
recruit the election volunteers and front-line workers on whom Western
democratic]{.underline} systems rely. Moreover, when election results
are disputed, individuals who are convinced their votes have been stolen
may attack the very institutions that play a role in solving disputes
and settling matters. Already there have been numerous threats against
judges involved in hearings of individuals accused of participating in
the Jan. 6 attack on Capitol Hill. Similarly, in Canada, judges
presiding over trials involving so-called freedom convoy supporters have
received threats to their physical safety. The [existence of networks of
individuals primed to receive and believe conspiracy-driven narratives,
and of adversarial states willing to exploit them for their own ends,
presents a real challenge for Western countries.]{.underline} As
[[Russia seeks to distract]{.mark} North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO) democracies from their efforts in Ukraine,]{.mark} we can
[expect further efforts]{.mark} to [amplify and encourage domestic
extremists]{.mark}]{.underline} who seek to remedy their grievances
through [the [threat of violence.]{.mark}]{.underline}

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) --- [[Election officials]{.mark} preparing
[for]{.mark} the **[upcoming midterms face a myriad of
threats]{.mark}**, both [foreign and domestic]{.mark}, as they look to
protect voting systems and run a smooth election [while fighting]{.mark}
a wave of [misinfo]{.mark}rmation [that]{.mark} has been
[undermin]{.mark}ing [public confidence in U.S.
elections]{.mark}]{.underline}. The nation's top state election
officials gathered Thursday for the start of their annual summer
conference, with a [long list of challenges that begins with securing
their voting systems]{.underline}. While a [**top concern** heading into
the 2020 presidential election was Russia or **another hostile nation
waging a disruptive cyberattack**]{.underline}, the landscape has
expanded to include ransomware, [politically motivated hackers and
insider threats]{.underline}. Over the last year, a small number of
[security [breaches have been reported]{.mark}]{.underline} at local
election offices in which authorities are investigating whether office
staff improperly accessed or provided improper access to sensitive
voting technology. [Jen Easterly, who leads the nation's cybersecurity
agency, said **[Russia, China and North Korea remain "very dynamic and
complex cyber threats"]{.mark}**]{.underline} and that criminal gangs
pushing ransomware were also a concern. But she noted election security
officials could not afford to prioritize one over the other[."We can't
just worry about one thing because if we focus too intently on one set
of threats, we're very likely to miss them coming from another
direction,"]{.underline} Easterly told reporters, after a series of
private meetings with state election officials. The U.S. Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency has been conducting physical
assessments for state and local election officials, which includes site
visits and reviews of security procedures such as video surveillance and
access controls. Physical security has always been a concern but an
[onslaught of [threats]{.mark} since 2020 [targeting]{.mark} election
[officials have added urgency]{.mark} to the effort]{.underline}. State
and local [election officials have reported being harassed in person and
receiving death threats over social media and text message]{.underline}.
"We're seeing [an [exodus of people in the field]{.mark}]{.underline}.
And some of it does relate to just the physical security threats that
they're facing," said Kim Wyman, who leads election security efforts for
the cybersecurity agency. "And what we're trying to do with this is give
them tools to be able to to deal with that."

kicked in to help --- including about \$800 million for election
security between 2016 and 2020 along with another \$400 million to run
safe elections during the coronavirus pandemic. [But that's only a
fraction of what officials have said is necessary to make elections as
secure as possible. "When [election officials]{.mark} don't have

me.]{.underline} The big ask Election funding proposals have ranged from
\$20 billion sought by Democratic election officials to a more modest
request for \$5 billion in the next budget cycle. The [Bipartisan Policy
Center has suggested spending about \$400 million annually on
elections]{.underline} and focusing on ideas favored by Republicans and
Democrats. But [bipartisan consensus is a long way off. Most Democratic

### Suburban Voters Key

#### Suburban Voters are key to Democrat success -- they turned the tides in 2018

[Democrats]{.underline} are [seeking a course correction in the suburbs
ahead of]{.underline} November's [midterms as recent elections show the
voting bloc beginning to trend Republican]{.underline}. [Suburban voters
helped boost Democrats during the 2018 midterms]{.underline} in what was
seen as a rebuke of then-President Trump. That rebuke [continued in
2020]{.underline}, as the group proved valuable to President Biden's
victory, as well as Democratic wins down the ballot. But last year's
[elections in Virginia and New Jersey saw Republicans make gains with
the demographic]{.underline}, thanks in part to mounting frustration
with rising prices, coronavirus restrictions and education-related
issues. Republicans are working to again pin the blame for those
frustrations on Democrats ahead of November. Democrats, meanwhile, are
working to persuade suburban voters they can be trusted with the issues
voters care about most. Polling shows [Democrats have their work cut out
for them]{.underline}. A Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll survey released last
month showed that [57 percent of suburban voters said they are more
likely to vote for a Republican candidate in the midterms, while 43
percent said they would be more likely to vote for a Democratic
candidate]{.underline}. Meanwhile, a Reuters-Ipsos poll released last
month showed Biden losing ground with the suburban voters who helped
elect him in 2020. [Only 41 percent of suburban voters]{.underline} said
they [approved of the job the president was doing]{.underline}. "The
reality of these [midterms]{.underline} is they're [going to be
difficult for Democrats]{.underline} as they sort of historically are
for the party in power in Washington," said Heather Williams, executive
director at the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. New Jersey
Gov. Phil Murphy (D), who also serves as the vide chair of the
Democratic Governors Association and who won reelection in 2021 by a far
narrower margin than expected, conducted a series of focus groups in the
Garden State to further understand why constituents were exhibiting
signs of discontent. The New York Times reported last week that the
governor's advisers found widespread frustrations pertaining to public
health measures.

-- aagg

[In]{.underline} almost [every election, suburban voters play a critical
role, and they will]{.underline} again [in November.]{.underline}
[During the Trump years,]{.underline} many [suburban voters, especially
women, shifted toward the Democrats]{.underline}. A [primary reason
was]{.underline} the [revulsion many of them felt toward President
Donald Trump. Democrats hope]{.underline}d that [shift signaled a more
permanent alignment]{.underline}, and it's true that some
college-educated White women became a key part of the Democratic
constituency. But what happened in the 2021 Virginia gubernatorial race
raised doubts about their reliability as Democrats. Then-candidate and
now-Gov. Glenn Youngkin was able to move the suburban vote back in the
Republicans' direction. "They weren't flaming liberals," GOP pollster
Whit Ayres said of the suburban women who backed Democrats in 2018 and
2020. "There was a reaction against Trump." Today, said GOP pollster
Kristen Soltis Anderson, "They're quite up for grabs."
[Democrat]{.underline}ic pollster Celinda Lake agreed that her party's
candidates [cannot take suburban women for granted in
November]{.underline}. "[Women elected Biden for stability and in
reaction to Trump,\"]{.underline} she said. "They really rejected his
style of leadership. But we had one woman say in a focus group, 'I just
want to get off this roller coaster.' " Under Biden so far, she added,
\"They're getting no help in doing that." Lake offered that assessment
before the leak of a Supreme Court draft ruling that would overturn Roe
v. Wade. That decision, if it comes early this summer, would give
Democrats an issue to counter Republicans in the competition for the
votes of suburban women. Republican strategists argue that unlike in
2020, they can now rely on suburban men turning out for their candidates
after seeing many anti-Trump GOP voters swing back to the party this
cycle. "Suburban women have moved so far the opposite direction, we're
not going to get all of them back right away. But if we can at least win
back a good amount of the suburban men that we lost and some of the
suburban women, that's a formula for us to win in pretty much every
state that we need to win in," said a Senate GOP strategist, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity so they could speak openly about the races
they are working on. The bottom line is that [any notable move by
suburban voters in the direction of the Republicans this fall will prove
costly to Democratic hopes of holding down their losses.]{.underline}
But a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade could counter GOP
efforts to woo suburban women.

[Suburban women could now tip the balance in the midterm elections that
will decide control of Congress after]{.underline} a leaked draft
opinion indicated the Supreme Court was poised to overturn [Roe v.
Wade]{.underline}. [Their votes]{.underline} helped [determine the
winner in the last two presidential contests]{.underline}. With
Republicans in position to seize the House and Senate, the race is on to
shock into action those with the most at stake on an issue that has
become a fiercely contested partisan issue. The fight to win them over
and get them to the ballot box will be most heated in the 24 states
where bans would take immediate effect. But both Republican and
Democratic strategists say that the country is in uncharted territory on
an issue where public policy has been relatively stable since the
landmark decision almost four decades ago. It remains to be seen if it's
a strong enough factor to influence key races and displace inflation as
the biggest worry among a slice of the population struggling with the
spiraling cost of living and ideologically slotted at the political
center. [Even though a large majority of women say abortion should be
legal in all or most cases, Democrats will have to convince them that it
is more pressing than every other issue boosting Republicans' odds in
November.]{.underline} President Joe [Biden defeated]{.underline} Donald
[Trump in 2020 by winning over women outside urban centers and with
strong support from them in places like Georgia]{.underline}.
[Republicans]{.underline}, who generally cheer the Supreme Court's
decision, had [sought to make Biden's poor approval rating and inflation
the top issues for voters]{.underline}. The GOP has also tried to erode
Democrats' advantage among women with issues like school closures,
curricula and mask mandates for schoolchildren. Melita Easters,
executive director of Georgia WIN List, which seeks to elect Democratic
women who favor abortion rights, said that the [court's decision would
dramatically boost turnout among women in the November midterm
elections.]{.underline} Democrats currently control both chambers by a
razor-thin majority. "Suburban areas where women have been on the fence
and voted either way based on the candidate, this is going to push them
to Democrats," she said. [Biden won suburban women 59% to Trump's
40%,]{.underline} according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than
110,000 voters. Vicky Hausman, co-founder of Forward Majority, which
seeks to win Democratic state legislative races, pointed to the Virginia
governor's race last year, where she said a strong focus on protecting
abortion rights by Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe boosted turnout
but was not enough for him to beat Republican Glenn Youngkin, who
focused on education issues. "In Virginia last year, it was a key issue
for Democrats, but not a big enough wedge to win," she said. Republicans
were already reminding voters on Tuesday that other issues were driving
their voters. ["This is an important issue to many people,"]{.underline}
said Florida Senator Rick Scott, chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee. ["But so is inflation, so is crime, so is the
border. People are going to be passionate about this and we ought to be
passionate about what we believe in."]{.underline} The draft Supreme
Court decision overturning Roe was published by Politico Monday night,
so it's still too soon to show up in polling, and state laws would not
change until the decision is issued, potentially in late June or early
July. The high court's final opinion could also be less dramatic than
the draft by Justice Samuel Alito. But strategists say that the issue is
most likely to be a major factor in four states with competitive
governor's races where bans would immediately go into effect this summer
if Roe is overturned: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin. That's
especially true in Georgia, where incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp,
currently leading in polls, signed the abortion ban into effect in 2019.
An Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll in January showed more than
two-thirds of Georgia voters wanted Roe v. Wade to remain in place. A
higher turnout among abortion rights supporters in governor's races
could also boost Senate candidates in competitive races in Arizona,
Georgia and Wisconsin. [Women tend to hold more liberal positions on
abortion than men, but are also more polarized on the
issue.]{.underline} A third of all women say abortion should be legal in
all cases, while 19% of men hold that position. At the other end, 18% of
women say abortion should be illegal in all cases, compared to 13% of
men. Opinions on the 1973 Supreme Court decision have remained largely
consistent over the years. A 2021 Gallup poll found 58% opposed
overturning Roe v. Wade, a nearly identical numbers to results on the
same question in 1989. But the enthusiasm gap on the issue has grown
over the past two decades, with 30% of self-described "pro-life" voters
saying they would vote for a candidate only who shares their views on
abortion, according to Gallup. [Only 19% of voters who favor abortion
rights similarly insist that candidates they support hold their views.
In 2000, those numbers were roughly equal at 20% or so. That could
change if Roe v. Wade is overturned.]{.underline}

### Youth Voters Key

#### Youth Voter Turnout is key for victory -- Biden needs to find way for progress

[Soaring turnout]{.underline} and big margins [among young voters were
central to the Democratic victories in the 2018 congressional and 2020
presidential elections.]{.underline} But with many young people
expressing disenchantment with President Joe Biden's performance,
[preserving those advantages looms as one of the biggest challenges
facing Democrats in the 2022 midterms]{.underline}. There's widespread
concern among Democrats that turnout for young people this November
could fall back from its gains in 2018 toward the meager levels that
contributed to the party's crushing losses in the 2014 and 2010 midterm
elections. "If you accept the status quo with young people, it's not
going to go great," says Democratic pollster Ben Tulchin. "Turnout is
not going to be good." Most Republicans are expecting exactly that sort
of decline, driven both by waning enthusiasm for Biden and diminishing
concern about Donald Trump, whose visibility has dimmed since he left
the White House. "We are seeing that [younger voters who were voting in
some of these elections because of Trump don't seem to be inspired by
Biden]{.underline}, and I think their turnout will fall back to
traditional levels," says GOP consultant John Brabender. Some structural
dynamics may help to sustain youth turnout this fall. Many experts note
that the large youth turnout of 2018 and 2020 creates momentum for
continued participation, because people who register and vote in one
election are more likely to vote in the next. [Over the past two
elections, Democrats and nonpartisan groups have built a significant
organizational infrastructure to engage more young voters]{.underline},
and those efforts are continuing through 2022. "The elevated youth
turnout and the elevated youth registration and participation that we
saw from '16 to '18 to '20 is not magic," says Nsé Ufot, chief executive
officer of the New Georgia Project, a non-profit voter registration and
mobilization group founded by Stacey Abrams. "It is absolutely a direct
result of our investment and our labor and targeting that particular
group." et many strategists focusing on the youth vote agree that these
factors may not be enough to prevent a significant fall-off without
changes in the political environment. One key for Democrats will be
finding ways to raise the visibility of Trump, who was deeply unpopular
with the youngest voters. [Even more important may be Biden finding ways
to generate more progress than he has so far on issues]{.underline}
important to younger generations, particularly combating climate change
and reducing the burden of student debt. "My stern warning to the Biden
administration and Democrats is you have to take this seriously, because
[if we]{.underline} do [go back to a 2010 or 2014 model where they
really fall off it's going to make it very difficult for us in
November]{.underline}," says Tulchin, who served as the pollster for
Bernie Sanders during the 2020 primary campaign, when the senator from
Vermont dominated Biden among younger voters.

[Joe Biden can thank record voter turnout]{.underline}, women, Black and
Latino Americans, young people and voters [eager to get Donald Trump out
of office for the Democratic president\'s 2020 victory]{.underline}.
Unfortunately for Biden and his Democratic Party, the [voters expected
to turn out this fall will be fewer, older, more likely to be white --
and eager to take out their frustrations on the party in
charge.]{.underline} Those historical voting patterns are a big reason
why Democrats face such daunting challenges this fall as they struggle
to hang onto razor-thin majorities in Congress. And it has Democrats
scrambling to find ways to tweak the turnout machine in key states,
where even a shift of a single percentage point in a voter group could
decide who controls the Senate next year. Not only are minority and
young voters typically less likely to vote in midterm elections, but the
p[eople who are inclined to turn out are in a mood to punish -- and that
means voting out incumbents,]{.underline} says Matt Grossman, director
of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State
University. \"It\'s better to say that you\'ve done something,\" if you
are the party in power, \"but you can\'t expect that to overwhelm the
basic dynamic -- and that is that people are more motivated by something
that has happened that they didn\'t like than that they did like,\"
Grossman says. Record high jobs creation? That\'s not resonating much
with voters upset about inflation that is at a 40-year high, experts
say. Record numbers of Black women being named to judicial posts by the
Biden administration? The voters who are thrilled by that development
can\'t match the motivation of parents convinced their K-12 children are
being made to feel guilty in the classroom for America\'s history of
slavery and racism. An anticipated Supreme Court opinion undoing
guaranteed abortion rights could well propel disaffected Democratic
voters to the polls in some areas of the country, making a pivotal
difference in key races, analysts say. With the governor poised to be
the one-person roadblock to abortion bans in several states,
pro-abortion rights voters may be more motivated to turn out, casting
votes for Democrats up and down the ballot. But Democrats still suffer
from basic math that disadvantages the party in midterms. [Voters 18-29
made up 17% of the 2020 electorate and voted heavily for Biden. In 2014,
the last midterm where a Democrat was president, young voters made up
just 13% of the electorate]{.underline}. In several states -- notably
Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona -- small shifts could decide whether
Biden will have a Democratic or GOP-run Senate next year. But the
peculiar natures of those states\' electorates and candidates could make
this fall far less predictable, analysts and political operatives say.
In Georgia, slight upticks in turnout by women and Black voters helped
Biden eke out a dramatic 2020 victory there and helped put Democrats
Sen. Raphael Warnock and Sen. Jon Ossoff over the top in 2021 runoffs,
flipping control of the Senate to Democrats. If typical midterm trends
stayed the same, Warnock would likely lose to a Republican. But \"there
are a couple of wild cards in the mix here\" that make the race far more
competitive, says political science professor Alan Abramowitz, an expert
on polling and elections at Emory University.

President Joe [[Biden\'s **disastrous economic
policies**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[higher taxes, uncontrolled spending,
oppressive regulations, suffocation of our energy sector---[are sending
the U.S. economy into a **slowdown**]{.mark}]{.underline}. His [assault
on]{.underline} [economic freedom is giving]{.underline} us
[skyrocketing **[inflation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, an [ongoing [**labor
crunch** and]{.mark} continuing [disruptions to the supply
chain]{.mark}]{.underline}---all of which are crippling an already
fragile recovery. Despite these darkening economic clouds, however,
there is a bright spot: [red states]{.underline}. Since pandemic
restrictions began to recede in mid-2020, states led by Republican
governors and state legislatures [[have been engines of economic
dynamism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Month after month, [red states have
**outperformed**]{.underline} the [national economic recovery
and]{.underline} continue to outshine their blue state counterparts.
Consider the most recent state jobs report for February. Once again,
states with [Republican governors took 15 of the top 20 spots for jobs
recovered since]{.underline} the onset of the [COVID]{.underline}-19
pandemic, and [17 of the top 20 have GOP-led legislatures]{.underline}.
In fact, [nine Republican states have emerged from the pandemic with
more jobs than when the pandemic hit: Arizona, Arkansas, Florida,
Georgia, Idaho, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and Utah]{.underline}. And
[12]{.underline} states with
[[Republican]{.underline}]{.mark}-controlled [[legislatures
are]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[seeing record-**low unemployment
rates**]{.mark}.]{.underline} It\'s a prime example of why policy
matters. [Biden might try to take credit for this economic comeback, but
any progress made is despite---not because of---his destructive
policies.]{.underline} [Democrats]{.underline} insisted on keeping our
country locked down without justification in order to amass ever-greater
power and control. They [ran mom-and-pop shops into the ground, sinking
life\'s savings, destroying livelihoods and **shattering
dreams**.]{.underline} Long after the acute crisis had ended, Democrats
disincentivized work by actively paying Americans to stay home. Many
blue states continued to offer an additional \$300 per week on top of
normal state unemployment payments. This additional cash didn\'t expire
until September 6, 2021---a year and a half after the start of the
pandemic. It\'s no wonder that as many as 1.8 million Americans turned
down jobs, with an estimated 37% of workers making more money from
unemployment and other state benefits than they would from actually
working a job.In fact, unfilled job openings are still at a near-record
high and employers are struggling to fill open positions. A recent
survey found that 48% of small businesses were hiring or trying to hire,
and 93% said there were \"few or no qualified job applicants.\" The
latest data still show a staggering 11.3 million job openings, even
though there are 6.2 million unemployed Americans trying to find a job.
[Employees are]{.underline}n\'t the only resource businesses are
[**struggling**]{.underline} to find. Thanks in large part to Biden\'s
out-of-control spending, [inflation has hit its **highest mark** in 40
years]{.underline}. More than [25% of small businesses say inflation is
the number one problem they face.]{.underline} Everything from [gas to
groceries]{.underline} now [cost]{.underline}s [dramatically
more]{.underline}, making it pricier for businesses to get the supplies
they need---if they can get them at all. The [supply chain crisis has
caused delays and shortages]{.underline}, making it difficult for
businesses to get certain goods and often [resulting in higher
prices]{.underline} for those of us trying to buy things. All [of
[this]{.mark} [has created a **hostile business environment**]{.mark}
that has killed jobs [and]{.mark}]{.underline} unnecessarily
[[slowed]{.underline}]{.mark} our [economic
**[recovery]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To make matters worse, the Federal
Reserve is going to try---belatedly---to rein in galloping inflation by
tightening the money supply. That is likely to create a perfect economic
storm of little-to-no growth accompanied by high inflation, resulting in
a painful recession. But thanks to pro-growth policies---lower taxes,
fewer regulatory burdens, no mandates and greater individual
liberty---the [[recovery in states with Republican leadership has been
noticeably faster and more significant]{.underline}.]{.mark} Not only
have red states returned to, or exceeded, their pre-pandemic employment
numbers, but residents are also seeing higher incomes. [Nine of the top
10 states with the greatest personal income growth in 2021 are led by
Republican governors.]{.underline}

The conclusions reached in this thesis demonstrate how [**economic
considerations** within states]{.underline} can [figure **prominently**
into the calculus for **future conflicts**]{.underline}. The findings
also suggest that [**security issues** with **economic or financial
underpinnings** will **transcend** classical determinants of war and
conflict, and change the manner by which **rival states** engage in
**hostile acts**]{.underline} toward one another. The research shows
that [**security concerns** emanating from **economic uncertainty** and
**the inherent vulnerabilities** within **global financial markets**
will present **new challenges** for national securi]{.underline}ty, and
provide developing states new asymmetric options for balancing against
stronger states. The security areas, identified in the proceeding
chapters, are likely to mature into global security threats in the
immediate future. As the case study on South Korea suggest, the
overlapping security issues associated with **[economic
[decline]{.mark}]{.underline}** and reduced military spending [[by the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [will [affect
**allied confidence** in **America's**]{.mark} **security
[guarantees]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The study shows that this outcome
could cause regional instability or realignments of strategic
partnerships in the Asia-pacific region with ramifications for U.S.
national security. [[Rival states]{.underline}]{.mark} and non-state
groups may also [become [**emboldened** to challenge **America's
status**]{.mark} in **the unipolar international system**]{.underline}.
The potential [[risks]{.underline}]{.mark} associated with **[stolen or
[loose WMD]{.mark}]{.underline}**, resulting from poor security, can
also pose a threat to U.S. national security. The case study on
Pakistan, Syria and North Korea show how [**financial
[constraints]{.mark}** [affect **weapons security** making weapons
**vulnerable**]{.mark} **to theft**]{.underline}, and how **[[financial
factors]{.underline}]{.mark}** can [[influence]{.mark} **WMD
[prolif]{.mark}eration**]{.underline} [by contributing to **the
motivating factors** behind **a trusted insider's decision** to sell
weapons technology. **The inherent [vulnerabilities]{.mark}**
[within]{.mark} **the global financial [markets]{.mark}**]{.underline}
will [[provide **terrorists**]{.mark}**' organizations** and **other
non-state groups**]{.underline}, who object to the current international
system or distribution of power, with [[opportunities to]{.mark} disrupt
global finance and]{.underline} perhaps [[weaken America's
status]{.underline}]{.mark}. A more ominous threat originates from
states intent on increasing diversification of foreign currency
holdings, establishing alternatives to the dollar for international
trade, or engaging financial warfare against the United States.

The [greatest investment opportunity in the world might be America's
political dysfunction and division]{.underline}. The outcome of various
state elections on Tuesday suggests that [the November 2022 midterm
Congressional elections might lead to even more gridlock]{.underline} in
Congress. If that happens, [the stock and options market should
flourish]{.underline} as investors position for the end of legislation
that targets businesses and the wealthy. The inability of Democrats to
win the governor's office in Virginia---a state handily won by President
Joe Biden---and the closeness of other state races, suggests that
[whatever the Federal Reserve does to interest rates may be overshadowed
by Congressional gridlock]{.underline}. The next few months will be
critical in seeing how this nascent thesis evolves, but Washington's
wish to regulate Wall Street and raise taxes suddenly seems less certain
to come true. The [2022 midterm elections are a long way off for
investors]{.underline}, but politicians and their campaign operatives
likely feel extraordinary urgency and risk. The midterms will contest 34
of 100 Senate seats, and the entire House of Representatives. If the
Republicans gain control of even one house of Congress, Biden will
become powerless to accomplish much of anything, and many
investment-risk factors will fade. "[Wall Street loves gridlock in
Washington because it tends to preserve the status quo]{.underline},"
Michael Schwartz, Oppenheimer & Co.'s chief options strategist, told
*Barron's.* Schwartz noted that [political developments are a potential
antidote to the normalization of the Fed's easy-money
policies.]{.underline} Until someone invents a way to make targeted
investments on political dysfunction, the financial sector remains one
of the top ways to position. [Finance is heavily regulated and the
inability of Congress to pass restrictive laws generally means banks and
brokerage firms thrive.]{.underline} We have previously recommended
financial stocks as a way to [benefit from higher
rates](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-policy-shift-buy-bank-stocks-51628755201?mod=article_inline),
and brokers, such as [Interactive

as [a way to
profit](https://www.barrons.com/articles/in-a-frothy-stock-market-this-might-be-your-best-move-51634803202?mod=article_inline)
from volatility and trading volumes. Those approaches still make sense,
as does private equity, but for a slightly different reason. [Investing
in private equity companies expresses confidence in the ability of those
firms to proactively deal with whatever develops]{.underline}. Consider
[KKR & Co.](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/kkr) (KKR), a
company we [last highlighted in late
April](https://www.barrons.com/articles/kkr-stock-is-near-its-high-it-still-has-room-to-run-51619692202?mod=article_inline)
when the stock was around \$56.71. Since then, the stock has surged, and
the company continues to seem well positioned. [KKR just
reportedbetter-than-expected
earnings](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kkr-earnings-rise-as-private-equity-portfolio-climbs-11635850320?mod=Searchresults_pos1&page=1),
while distributable earnings, or cash that could be returned to
shareholders, spiked. For the third quarter, distributable earnings
totaled \$925.1 million, or \$1.05 a share, up from \$452.8 million, or
53 cents a share in the same year-ago period. Investors who like the
looks of those earnings can consider harnessing the stock in the options
market. With KKR at \$83.31, investors can sell the March \$80 put for
about \$4.50 and buy the March \$85 call for about \$5.20. The risk
reversal---that is selling a put and buying a call with a higher strike
price but same expiration---positions investors to buy the stock at a
lower price, while enabling them to participate in any gains. Should KKR
be below \$80 at expiration, investors are obligated to buy the stock or
adjust the position in the options market to avoid assignment. If the
stock is at \$100, for instance, the call is worth \$15[. During the
past 52 weeks, the stock has ranged from \$35.32 to \$83.44. Shares are
up 106% this year]{.underline}. Without doubt, the trade expresses great
confidence in KKR, but faith in the company has been well rewarded since
the company was first mentioned here in August 2016 as a stock that was
reversing years of mixed performance. *Steven M. Sears is the president

How do elections influence equities? Many commentators we follow seem to
have preconceived notions of which candidate or party is best for
markets. But in Fisher Investments Canada's view, [equities don't prefer
any party or politician.]{.underline} We suggest investors set this view
of party and personality aside. Instead, we think it is [most helpful to
assess political developments the way our research shows markets do:
Will elections likely result in gridlock]{.underline} or not? Whilst it
may seem counterintuitive[, political gridlock is often a positive
development for equities]{.underline}, in our view. Fisher Investments
Canada defines gridlock as political conditions that make it difficult
for a government to pass legislation. In our experience, [many investors
hate gridlock since it means governments don't do much]{.underline}. We
think most voters understandably want elected officials to get things
they like done. [But]{.underline} in our view, [that preference for
action can also make it harder to see political activity the way
equities do]{.underline}---as we will explain. [Gridlock can take
various forms]{.underline}. One common version is a multiparty coalition
with little ideological alignment. For example, [Germany]{.underline}'s
[recently elected coalition combines left-leaning and right-leaning
parties]{.underline}. They may command a majority on a combined basis,
but our research shows [the scope of action they agree on is narrow and
centrist]{.underline}---not radical and sweeping---with little likely to
get done. But we have seen ideologically aligned multiparty coalitions
at loggerheads, too---when a far-left or far-right party differs from
their more moderate counterparts in policy emphasis and implementation,
as with the leftist and centre-left parties in Spain's and Portugal's
governments. Similarly, we find [minority governments are by definition
gridlocked]{.underline}, as they must get dissenting parties' support or
agreement to abstain from voting to pass legislation---as is the case in
Canada currently. Even in [one-party majority governments, gridlock can
stymie leadership's agenda]{.underline}. Fisher Investments Canada has
observed intraparty gridlock---divisions within the majority party---can
also block government action. We saw this often in [former U.S.
President Donald Trump's first two years, when his Republican Party had
a majority in America's Congress]{.underline}. We are seeing it again
now under President Joe Biden's Democratic Party, which also has
majorities in both chambers of Congress. [A leader with weak political
capital may not be able to push bills through]{.underline},
either---even with a majority, a leader's flagging popularity may result
in a leadership struggle that often means legislative activity grinds to
a halt, like in the UK now. Whatever gridlock's form, it typically does
two things. [One, it can block big proposed legislation. Two, it can
water down major proposals by forcing politicians to
compromise---resulting in something less extreme versus initial
expectations.]{.underline} Our research shows [equities in competitive
developed nations generally favour gridlock.]{.underline} [Big
legislative change (from any party) creates uncertainty]{.underline},
which we think can upset equities. [Gridlock]{.underline}, in our view,
reduces this likelihood[. It prevents lawmakers from radically altering
property rights or creating winners and losers through
legislation]{.underline}, regulations and other government levers. This
can reduce uncertainty over future tax rates, government interference,
labour laws and other factors potentially affecting corporate profits.
In our experience, [all major change---no matter how
well-intentioned---risks creating winners and losers]{.underline}.
Behavioural finance research shows people hate losses more than they
enjoy equivalent gains---a phenomenon psychologists term myopic loss
aversion or prospect theory.\[i\] This can generate net negative
sentiment when legislation creates winners and losers. Investors---and
voters---aren't always rational, according to prospect theory. [Big
change may benefit a party or parties' constituents, but myopic loss
aversion shows those who don't benefit tend to take it much harder,
which can outweigh any feeling of gain.]{.underline} For markets, this
[cognitive bias means any sweeping legislation---regardless of
party---risks being a headwind.]{.underline} Additionally, big shifts in
laws and rules governing [commerce can complicate businesses' ability to
plan and invest]{.underline}. We think gridlock---for equities---lowers
political uncertainty overall. So, how does a typical election cycle
affect equities? We find elections often drive big emotions, as
politicians cater to constituents' biases, sowing uncertainty---who will
and won't benefit? This weighs on risk taking. When everything is up in
the air, subject to change, it is difficult to see through the fog. In
our experience[, the prospect of political change can weigh on
investors' moods---e.g. uncertainty can make it harder for businesses to
plan longer term.]{.underline} Not knowing what the political
environment will be---and how it may affect businesses---can hamper
their ability to make investment decisions, committing capital and
resources. This could weigh on growth until the air clears and firms
have more certainty to pursue big, strategic projects. But [if the vote
results in gridlock, lawmakers likely won't be able to accomplish as
much as they promised on the campaign trail.]{.underline} The election
outcome plus gridlock [lowers political uncertainty, giving businesses
more clarity to proceed with long-term expansion and allowing them to
take more risk than they otherwise might]{.underline}. This may be
disappointing to some---and encouraging to others---but [for markets, we
think gridlock establishes a political environment in which little will
likely change.]{.underline} That [allows forward-looking markets to see
further ahead]{.underline}, knowing the business framework firms are
operating under probably won't be toppled anytime soon. Our long read of
history suggests politicians' and government actions can be
unpredictable. [Gridlock cuts down on the uncertainty]{.underline},
leaving one less risk for equities to ponder---and an underappreciated
market tailwind, in our view. Investing in equity markets involves the
risk of loss and there is no guarantee that all or any capital invested
will be repaid. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.

[The [economy will do well with government]{.mark} control
[divided]{.mark}]{.underline} between Democrats and Republicans. I
didn't always believe this, but a decade ago I was persuaded by the late
economist William A[. Niskanen]{.underline}. [\"Our federal government
may work better]{.underline} (well, less badly) [[when at least one
house of Congress is controlled by the opposing
party]{.underline}]{.mark},\" he wrote. \"[Divided government
is]{.underline}, curiously, [[less divisive]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It's
also [cheaper]{.mark}]{.underline}. The basic reason for this is simple:
[When [one party proposes drastic or foolish measures, the other party
can obstruct them]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States prospers most
when excesses are curbed, and, if the numbers from the past 50 years are
any indication, divided government is what curbs them.\" [Excesses have
been evident since the election of]{.underline} Donald
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, not only [from the president's Twitter
account]{.underline} but also [from his opponents]{.underline}. We've
[[seen huge deficits]{.mark} from the party that used to be
tight-fisted]{.underline}. We've seen [[draconian immigration actions.
Global trade relations]{.mark} are [in turmoil]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Maybe some [[gridlock will be good for us]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Niskanen, writing in 2006, found only two eras of fiscal restraint since
World War II: the last six years of Eisenhower's administration, and the
last six years of the Clinton administration. In both eras, the
opposition party controlled Congress. [[War also seems to be absent from
periods of divided government]{.underline}]{.mark}. Niskanen also wrote:
\"In 200 years of U.S. history, every one of our conflicts involving
more than a week of ground combat has been initiated by a unified
government. [Each of the [four major American wars]{.mark}]{.underline}
during the 20th century, for example---[[W]{.mark}orld [W]{.mark}ar
[I]{.mark}, [W]{.mark}orld [W]{.mark}ar [II]{.mark}, the [Korean]{.mark}
War, [and]{.mark} the [Vietnam]{.mark} War---was [initiated by a
Dem]{.mark}ocratic [president with]{.mark} the [support of]{.mark} a
[Dem]{.mark}ocratic [Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}. The current war in
Iraq, initiated by a Republican president and backed by a Republican
Congress, is consistent with this pattern.\" [[Major government
changes]{.mark} are likely to be [stable when]{.mark} they are
[developed by divided government]{.mark}]{.underline}, Niskanen also
argued. He cited Reagan tax cuts, approved by a Democrat-controlled
House of Representatives. A more modern example [is Obamacare, passed
during one-party control]{.underline}, which the other party vowed to
repeal as soon as possible. Although that repeal didn't happen, [the
country continues to suffer from uncertainty about health care
policy]{.underline}. The economy is not managed by the government, but
by millions of individuals and companies trying to make the best choices
for themselves. [[When the government does take action in the economic
sphere, it's not entirely for the public interest]{.underline}]{.mark}.
We learned this from Niskanen's most lasting contributions to economics,
his theory of bureaucracy, part of public choice economics. He said that
[[people in government are human, and their decisions will at least
partially reflect their own ambitions]{.mark}.]{.underline} Bureaucrats
want larger budgets and influence. Looking forward to 2019 and 2020,
expect less extravagant federal spending growth---at least a little bit.
Don't expect major tax cuts again. Look for deregulation to continue in
those areas where Congressional approval is not needed. This direction
will be good for the economy. A president can do a good bit of mischief
all by himself. Barack Obama campaigned in 2008 against too much
presidential power accorded to George W. Bush, but changed his tune
after he held power. A Democrat-controlled House of Representatives will
not grant additional discretionary authority to the president, though
they will be unable to roll back power granted by existing laws. Foreign
trade is an area where past Congresses granted the president wide
latitude---much to the regret of many existing members. Look for
continued controversy here. Immigration is an area ripe for compromise,
and maybe the odds are a little better now. But just a little. Nobody
thinks current law is ideal, and nobody thinks current law is being
enforced. But this may be too thorny an issue for Congress to resolve.
That means immigration will continue to be low, exacerbating the tight
labor market that has been caused by economic growth and demographic
change. I recently wrote that the economy would probably not go into
recession in 2019, but that we should all be prepared for the
possibility. I stand by that statement even after the election results.

### GOP Solves Growth

#### Republican win good---key to economic stability and high employment rates

[States with Republican governors are leading the recovery from the
Covid-19 economic shock]{.underline}, complicating President Joe Biden's
push for a new sweeping infusion of federal aid. [Of the 15 states that
have returned to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity, 12 are led by
Republican governors,]{.underline} [Federal Reserve
data](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/regional-economic-analysis/state-coincident-indexes)
[shows.]{.underline} Of the 10 states reporting the lowest levels of
activity since January 2020, seven --- including New York, Pennsylvania
and Illinois --- are run by Democratic governors. Businesses, economists
and policymakers are divided over whether conservative governors'
policies on jobless benefits and Covid-19 restrictions --- many of them
chose not to issue stay-at-home orders at all --- are actually helping
their economies or if their states' industries simply didn't fall as far
behind during the pandemic[. Red states are also reporting lower
unemployment numbers. Still, the uneven recovery and the lackluster job
growth reported in both April and May have given Republicans ammunition
to repudiate Biden's expensive aid plans.]{.underline} They've also
ignited concerns among conservatives that the federal assistance ---
especially the \$1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that passed without
GOP support in March --- should have focused more on who needed help the
most. "Across the board, there could have been a lot better use of the
funds being more targeted," Rachel Greszler, an economist at the
Heritage Foundation, said. Congress should have linked unemployment
insurance to workers' earnings or allowed states to use federal aid to
dole out their own benefits based on what the labor market required "in
the ways that they thought would work best for them," she said. The
seven states that chose to not issue a stay-at-home order last year ---
Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and Utah
--- were all led by GOP governors. Republican-led states were also early
to ease pandemic business restrictions and mask mandates: Missouri,
Montana, Iowa and Alaska were some of the first states to peel back
their business requirements in January and February. Texas, Arizona,
Arkansas, New Hampshire and Wyoming followed in March[. Of those states,
Montana, New Hampshire, Arkansas, South Dakota, Utah, Missouri and
Nebraska returned to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity in April
and reported lower unemployment than the national 5.8 percent rate in
May. By comparison, states that still have some coronavirus restrictions
in place, including California, Connecticut and Hawaii, saw the highest
rates of unemployment in the country in May and were still producing
less in April than they did pre-pandemic.]{.underline} Washington
lawmakers sent direct checks to millions of middle- and lower-income
Americans and supplemented state unemployment benefits with extra weekly
payments and coverage for workers traditionally ineligible for jobless
aid. [They also doled out \$1 trillion in forgivable government-backed
loans to small businesses under the Paycheck Protection Program,
initially on a first-come, first-served basis.]{.underline} Other
economists question whether Congress could have maneuvered as precisely
as Greszler suggested to rescue the economy in the beginning, facing a
flood of business closures and tens of millions of layoffs caused by the
pandemic health restrictions. "There isn't a lot of nuance that you can
use in policy when you're trying to get money out the door as quickly as
possible and adjust for the local situations for every worker in the
state," said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor. "It's very
difficult to get aid out to everybody who needs it at the same time, and
in a way that was actually targeted through individual situations." The
uneven nature of the recovery partly reflects the diversity of state
economies. States like New York, California, Hawaii and Nevada that rely
heavily on tourism, as well as food and accommodations, are some of the
deepest in the economic hole and have the longest way to go, according
to the Federal Reserve's April State Coincident Index, which estimates
economic conditions based on local employment and wage data matched to
states' GDP trends. As of April, Hawaii's economic activity is 13
percent below where it was in January 2020, according to the index.
Activity in Nevada and New York is also still down near 10 percent
compared to before the pandemic. Florida, down just 1 percent, is doing
better. But states including Utah, Idaho, South Dakota and Nebraska that
rely largely on food processing and manufacturing --- industries deemed
essential and required to stay open during the pandemic --- are getting
back to normal much more quickly. "What we're seeing is the states that
were down the most at the beginning are still down the most, and those
were basically the states that rely most on travel," said Michael
Ettlinger, founding director of the Carsey School of Public Policy at
the University of New Hampshire. "There's just more destruction, if you
will, in those states, and it's just going to take longer to come back."
The edge that GOP-led states such as Georgia, Mississippi, Arizona, and
Missouri enjoy in rebounding from the pandemic has fueled Republican
attacks against Biden's policies. More than two dozen GOP governors have
moved to end supplemental unemployment benefits funded by the federal
government, citing labor shortages they say are triggered by the
generosity. [In Congress, Republican lawmakers are using a similar
argument against Biden's plans to spend \$4 trillion shoring up the
nation's infrastructure and expanding social programs. "Our focus should
be rebuilding the economy as quickly as possible, not subsidizing it,"
said Sen.]{.underline} Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), who cited the extension of
unemployment benefits [as a reason for voting
against](https://www.kotatv.com/2021/03/07/sen-rounds-believes-covid-relief-package-disincentivizes-returning-workforce/)
an aid package pushed through by Democrats in March. Some economists say
it's unclear if generous unemployment benefits are a factor keeping jobs
from being filled. [A June
analysis](https://www.uschamber.com/series/above-the-fold/data-shows-worker-availability-sinking-toward-historic-lows-all-over-again)
from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce itself found the ratio of available
workers to job openings is about what it was pre-pandemic. Before Covid,
"businesses were struggling to fill openings because the available
workers lacked the skills businesses needed," senior economist Curtis
Dubay wrote. "That issue persists now." [And a May
analysis](https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/05/27/job-search-activity-jumps-states/)from
the hiring website Indeed's chief economist, Jed Kolko, found that job
search activity in states ending the federal benefits saw a short,
temporary jump on the platform shortly after governors announced they
would do so. Economists, as well as the Biden administration, also say
issues such as continuing day care struggles for parents, lingering fear
of contracting the virus, and an economy that seems like it has gone
from zero to 60 in a matter of weeks are probably having the strongest
effect. "We've got this kind of race to the bottom, state-after-state,
with Republican governors ... ending benefits, and frankly, misleading
people," Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said. "They tried to
make a big deal out of saying we're cutting the \$300 extra. That's just
not true. They're cutting extra a week, they're cutting the gig workers
out, if someone has exhausted the state benefits." With [about 4 million
Americans](https://tcf.org/content/commentary/fact-sheet-whats-stake-states-cancel-federal-unemployment-benefits/)
--- disproportionately workers of color and women --- facing "an income
practically of zero ... that makes the need for federal reform much more
serious," he said. "This crazy quilt of state systems that offer
differing levels of data, unemployment benefits and approaches on
reopening to me highlight the need, the urgency of fundamental reform,"
Wyden said. He's advocating for [an overhaul of the unemployment
system](https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-bennet-unveil-unemployment-insurance-overhaul)
that would unite all states under one benefits infrastructure and create
automatic triggers [linking benefits to economic conditions, among other
things.]{.underline} Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Wyden last
year proposed extending the jobless benefit program until a state's
unemployment rate fell below 6 percent, but Republicans were hesitant to
support a long-term extension of taxpayer-funded unemployment aid. If
Congress had enacted that proposal last July, 27 states would currently
have a low enough unemployment rate to phase out the extra \$300 in
extra benefits under the program. "Hopefully what this drives is a
conversation after the pandemic is over on how to improve our safety
net," Zhao said, "not just in terms of expanding it but also making sure
that it's actually reaching the people it needs to and reaching them
quickly when help is needed."

Today, [**Republican** leaders **should explicitly remind Americans of
this history**, and point out to voters that they have a similar
opportunity before them]{.underline}. Just as George H.W. Bush handed
his predecessor an economy that was rapidly recovering from recession
only to have it wrecked by a Democrat president tacking left, Donald
Trump gave Biden the strongest economic recovery in history. As we know,
Biden proceeded to quickly squander it. Just as in 1994, however, the
[**election** **of** large **Republican majorities in the House and
Senate** would **produce** an **immediate change** **in** the **national
morale and economic culture. Biden's weak economy would begin turning
around the day after the election.** The results would be seen
instantly. Coupled with a legislative agenda of strong pro-growth
policies, a **Republican Congress could go a long way toward saving the
U.S. economy**, creating jobs, and producing a rapid return to
prosperity.]{.underline} And who knows---perhaps Biden would even have
the sense to take a page out of Bill Clinton's book, and race back to
the political center to save his presidency, and the economy along with
it.

### Impact -- Econ 

#### Economic collapse causes great power war

<https://asiatimes.com/2020/04/ingredients-in-place-for-new-great-power-war/>,
accessed on 11/16/2020, JMP)

World War II [The events leading to war in 1939 included]{.underline} a
sharp division between the wealthy and everyone else, **[economic
catastrophe]{.underline}** [in the Great Depression]{.underline}, sharp
reductions in global trade, a breakdown in international cooperation,
and the end of liberal governance in much of the world. Once again,
these variables are present. [Even before]{.underline} the
[Covid]{.underline}-19 pandemic, [trade was decreasing]{.underline} and
beggar-thy-neighbor economic policies had become the norm. It might be
tempting to place this blame on Trump, but he was elected by people in
his country who have suffered 40 years of criminal economic competition
from China. It is no wonder they elected Trump and it is no wonder he
undermined a global trade system that has failed America's working
class. Similarly, [evidence of **the breakdown** of **international
cooperation** and **liberalism** are everywhere]{.underline}. The world
is unable to deal with the existential threat of climate change.
Authoritarian regimes have seats on the UN Human Rights Council. There
is a great and increasing gap between the wealthy and everyone else, a
new Gilded Age. Liberalism, unable to cope, is in retreat everywhere,
from the US and the UK to fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe and
Latin America. Our world is gravely ill. Pandemic [Into this morass we
stir a global pandemic]{.underline}, with its origin in a corrupt,
authoritarian state that is hostile to openness, human dignity and
truth. That China denied and then exported the pandemic was as
predictable as it is lamentable. [The pandemic will bring **a global
economic depression**, the **only variable from World War II not present
today**.]{.underline} We should expect more governments to fall, [we
should expect liberalism to retreat further]{.underline}, and we should
expect increased nationalism and violence upon our own species. In
short, we are in for dark days. [Dictators attempt to divert the
attention of their people]{.underline} from corruption and injustice [by
seeking **external enemies**. Wars will]{.underline} therefore
**[increase]{.underline}**, and [status quo powers such as
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [may
attempt to defend a crumbling system]{.underline}. [The chance of war
between China and the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has **increased dramatically** because almost
all of the **structural variables today** point toward war]{.underline}.
Both [World War I and II]{.underline} were avoidable because different
variables were present. Consequently, had skilled leadership been
present, each war might have been avoided by correctly diagnosing the
causes of the impending crises. That the wars were not avoided does not
mean they could not have been; it simply means leadership was not up to
the task. But today the [causes]{.underline} of both of those wars [have
been **combined in a single cauldron**]{.underline}. So it is reasonable
to ask, [even with good leadership]{.underline} (of which there is no
doubt we are lacking), [can **great-power war** be avoided?]{.underline}

#### Economic decline causes nuclear war

Stein **Tønnesson 15**, Research Professor, Peace Research Institute
Oslo; Leader of East Asia Peace program, Uppsala University, 2015,
"Deterrence, interdependence and Sino--US peace," International Area
Studies Review, Vol. 18, No. 3, p. 297-311

Several [recent works]{.underline} on China and Sino--US relations [have
made]{.underline} substantial [contributions to the current
understanding of how and under what circumstances]{.underline} a
combination of [nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence may
reduce the risk of war between major powers]{.underline}. At least four
conclusions can be drawn from the review above: first, those who say
that [interdependence may **both inhibit and drive
conflict**]{.underline} are right. [Interdependence raises the cost of
conflict]{.underline} for all sides [but]{.underline} [asymmetrical or
unbalanced dependencies and **negative trade expectations**]{.underline}
may [generate tensions leading to trade wars among inter-dependent
states that]{.underline} in turn [increase the risk of military
conflict]{.underline} (Copeland, 2015: 1, 14, 437; Roach, 2014). The
risk may increase if one of the interdependent countries is governed by
an inward-looking socio-economic coalition (Solingen, 2015); second, the
risk of war between China and the US should not just be analysed
bilaterally but include their allies and partners. Third party countries
could drag China or the US into confrontation; third, in this context it
is of some comfort that the three main economic powers in Northeast Asia
(China, Japan and South Korea) are all deeply integrated economically
through production networks within a global system of trade and finance
(Ravenhill, 2014; Yoshimatsu, 2014: 576); and fourth, [decisions for
war]{.underline} and peace [are taken by very few people, who act on the
basis of their future expectations]{.underline}. International relations
theory must be supplemented by foreign policy analysis in order to
assess the value attributed by national decision-makers to economic
development and their assessments of risks and opportunities. [If
leaders]{.underline} on either side of the Atlantic [begin to seriously
**fear or anticipate their own nation's decline**]{.underline} then
[they may blame]{.underline} this on [external dependence, appeal to
anti-foreign sentiments, contemplate the use of force to
gain]{.underline} respect or [credibility, adopt protectionist policies,
and]{.underline} ultimately **[refuse to be deterred by]{.underline}**
either [**nuclear arms** or prospects of socioeconomic calamities. Such
a dangerous shift could happen **abruptly**]{.underline}, i.e. under the
instigation of actions by a third party -- or against a third party. Yet
as long as there is both nuclear deterrence and interdependence, the
tensions [in East Asia]{.underline} are unlikely to escalate to war. As
Chan (2013) says, all states in the region are aware that they cannot
count on support from either China or the US if they make provocative
moves. [The greatest risk is **not**]{.underline} that **[a territorial
dispute]{.underline}** leads to war under present circumstances [but
that **changes in the world economy** alter those circumstances in ways
that render inter-state peace more precarious]{.underline}. If China and
the US fail to rebalance their financial and trading relations (Roach,
2014) then a trade war could result, interrupting transnational
production networks, provoking social distress, and exacerbating
nationalist emotions. [This could have unforeseen consequences in the
field of security, with nuclear deterrence remaining the only factor to
**protect the world from Armageddon**, and **unreliably
so**]{.underline}. [Deterrence could **lose its
credibility**]{.underline}: one of the two [great powers might gamble
that the other yield in a cyber-war or conventional]{.underline} limited
[war]{.underline}, or third party countries might engage in conflict
with each other, with a view to obliging Washington or Beijing to
intervene.

### Impact -- Inflation

#### GOP solves inflation -- Biden failed

**Rubin 6/14** -- Richard Rubin, reporter focusing on the intersection
of taxes, politics and economics at The Wall Street Journal,
"Republicans Aim to Combat Inflation With Tax, Trade Policies", *The
Wall Street Journal*,
https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-offers-tax-trade-policies-aimed-at-combating-inflation-11655222400,
June 14, 2022, accessed 7-13-2022//Tata

WASHINGTON---Congressional [[Republicans]{.mark} are beginning to
[detail their plans to **combat inflation**]{.mark} and soften its
impact on households, indicating some tax, trade and regulatory policies
they might pursue [if they take]{.mark} control of [the]{.mark} House
and Senate in this fall's [midterm elections]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sen.
Chuck [Grassley]{.underline} (R., Iowa) on Tuesday is [proposing to
adjust a tax-code provision for inflation and reduce some taxes on
investments]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [Republicans]{.underline} on the
House Ways and Means Committee are [outlining their anti-inflation
agenda, calling for rescinding unused federal spending, reducing
regulation and negotiating new trade agreements]{.underline}. The
policies [offer a preview of the fall midterm election campaign, where
inflation is likely to be one of the core issues on voters'
minds]{.underline} as Republicans try to regain control of the House and
Senate. But in the closely divided Congress, it is difficult to design
politically viable legislative proposals that remove money from the
economy or significantly reduce costs for businesses and households.
"The [[Biden]{.mark} administration [has]{.mark} offered [no real
solutions]{.mark}---just more Washington spending and higher taxes on
Main Street businesses that will fuel higher prices in the
future]{.underline}," said Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), the top
Republican on the Ways and Means Committee. [Republicans have focused on
inflation, which hit 8.6% in May for its highest level since 1981, as
Democrats' greatest vulnerability this fall]{.underline}. They have
argued that the [Biden administration's policies]{.underline}, including
its push to [enact a \$1.9 trillion pandemic aid package]{.underline} in
early 2021, have helped [fuel price increases]{.underline}. President
Biden has contended his policies spurred job growth and have helped
fight the pandemic. He has also been calling out Republicans for lacking
clear policies to fight inflation. He has emphasized the importance of
the Federal Reserve but has also called for Congress to pass a law to
subsidize household costs such as prescription drugs and child care as
prices rise. "My plan is to make concrete---concrete, common-sense steps
to bring down the biggest expenses that families are facing," Mr. Biden
said in a speech last month. The president has been trying to link
Republicans to an idea from Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.) to impose minimum
income taxes on all Americans. Mr. Scott last week reframed that
proposal as a work requirement. The newest fiscal proposals from
Republicans fit more squarely into conservative economic ideology,
though all would be difficult to get through a divided Congress and past
Mr. Biden, who would be able to veto any legislation passed by a
Republican-controlled Congress. Mr. [[Grassley said his plans would
encourage savings and cool]{.underline}]{.mark} demand as a way to
combat [[inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}. He [would change the income
threshold for the 3.8% investment-income tax created in
Obamacare]{.underline}. It currently starts once income reaches
\$200,000 for an individual and \$250,000 for a married couple and
doesn't rise each year like other tax code provisions. He would raise
the latter threshold to \$400,000 and index both to inflation. [Mr.
Grassley would also exempt interest income from
taxation]{.underline}---up to \$300 for individuals and \$600 for
married couples. He would [expand a tax credit for middle-income
households to save for retirement and more than double the income levels
at which capital gains]{.underline} and dividend income starts being
taxed so that the 0% tax bracket for that investment income would end
when income reaches \$89,075 for individuals and \$178,150 for married
couples. "When people are encouraged to save, the more you save, it
reduces demand. That helps inflation," he said. "Hopefully the November
elections make a big change and we're able to move on these things in
the next Congress." Mr. Grassley would pay for those changes by
extending---without indexing for inflation---the \$10,000 cap on the
state and local tax deduction. [[The House outline includes policies
that Republicans have advocated before, including rescinding unused
federal spending, extending expiring tax cuts, increasing energy
production and removing some regulations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Extending
tax cuts set to lapse after 2025 could put more money into the economy
and be inflationary, but Republicans will advocate that as a way to spur
growth.

#### Unchecked inflation triggers global war and disrupt the international liberal order

-High costs cause political upheaval

-Hikes in IRs disrupt fragile states

-Forces US retrenchment which emboldens rivals

**Brands** 1-20-**2022**, Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins
University's School of Advanced International Studies (Hal, "Inflation's
Biggest Risk Is Geopolitical Unrest," Bloomberg,
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-20/inflation-s-biggest-risk-is-geopolitical-unrest)

[Inflation isn't just a domestic problem]{.underline}. Sure,
year-on-year inflation hitting 7%, the highest rate in four decades, is
threatening to derail Joe Biden's presidency. As my Bloomberg colleague
John Authers has written, the inflationary trend appears broad and
durable. Yet now as before, [[inflation is a geopolitical
phenomenon]{.mark}, which is [rooted]{.mark}]{.underline} partly [[in
rising]{.mark} global [tensions and could **have deeply corrosive
effects** on the U.S.-led world]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[order]{.underline}. [That's what happened]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
last time the U.S. faced this problem, [from the late 1960s to the early
1980s]{.mark}]{.underline}. "To all Americans," Ronald Reagan said while
running for president in 1980, inflation had become \"something as
violent as a mugger, as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as
a hit man.\" [The causes were closely tied to global
affairs]{.underline}. [In the late 1960s]{.underline}, the combined
costs of the Vietnam War and President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society
programs sent prices rising. In the 19**[70s]{.underline}**, the chief
drivers were soaring energy costs and supply disruptions caused by the
Yom Kippur War of 1973 and then the Iranian revolution of 1978-1979. It
was a vicious cycle: Geopolitical upheaval caused economic upheaval,
which then added to the underlying global instability. [[High oil costs
and scarce supplies caused ruptures within the democratic
world]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Japan, France and other U.S. allies
scrambled to cut bilateral deals with oil producers. [[Inflation ate
away at]{.mark} an American [defense budget]{.mark} that was already
falling]{.underline} as a result of post-Vietnam retrenchment. Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger worried that economic chaos might destabilize
the Western world. It certainly contributed to a general malaise in
America and other advanced democracies, feeding fears that the Soviet
Union --- then benefitting from record oil prices --- might win the Cold
War after all. "Can Capitalism Survive?" Time magazine famously asked in
1975. Only when the Federal Reserve finally broke the inflationary cycle
with bone-crushing interest rates did the U.S. regain its geopolitical
footing. [Today, rising]{.underline} energy [costs are again pushing
prices higher]{.underline}. [The messy divorce of]{.underline} economies
between the [U.S. and China is disrupting supply chains and generating
inflationary pressure]{.underline}. [The economic messiness provoked
by]{.underline} another geopolitical breakup --- [Brexit]{.underline}
--- [isn't helping]{.underline} matters. Not least, the inflation surge
has resulted from the massive stimulus that governments pumped into
their economies in response to Covid, the greatest global crisis of this
century. [[In countries where there]{.mark} is lots of [revolutionary
kindling, **inflation can provide the fatal
spark**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Historically, [rising prices
contribute]{.mark}d [to]{.mark} [political
upheaval]{.mark}s]{.underline} such as the French Revolution, which
touched off a quarter-century of war in Europe, and the Arab Spring,
whose effects are still roiling the Middle East. This month, a doubling
of fuel prices triggered protests, revolt and then Russian-backed
repression in Kazakhstan. **[[There's]{.mark} probably [more of this to
come]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In late 2021, the Food and Agriculture
Organization at the United Nations reported that global food prices had
reached their highest point in a decade. **[Look out for geo-economic
turbulence]{.underline}**, as well. Argentina, the European Union,
Russia and other countries have restricted the export of commodities
such as grain to keep domestic food prices manageable. [[If Washington
ratchets up interest rates]{.underline}]{.mark} to tame rising prices,
[[it could]{.mark} unintentionally [batter deeply indebted
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} that have already lost years, even
decades, of economic progress due to Covid. Indeed, when the Fed slayed
inflation in the early 1980s, a decade-long Latin American debt crisis
was part of the collateral damage. Finally, there is the question of
what will happen to the U.S. Biden isn't entirely wrong to argue that
inflation is actually a sign of strength: The U.S. economy rebounded
quickly from Covid, fueling demand that is outstripping supply. Yet
inflation is rarely a good-news story. [[Inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}
is psychologically demoralizing because it makes growth meaningless, and
stagnation crippling, for people whose real wages are in decline. It
fosters a sense that the people are victims of forces that their leaders
cannot control. It [gives credence to arguments that America's true
problems are at **home**, rather than abroad, and thus [threatens to
create a more **distracted**, **inward-looking** superpower just as
global threats are intensifying]{.mark}]{.underline}. The damage isn't
hypothetical: As John Ferrari of the American Enterprise Institute
points out, [[the U.S. defense budget is already at risk of being
strangled by the "inflation anaconda]{.underline}]{.mark}." The 5% bump
that Congress approved for the Pentagon this year sounds impressive, but
only until one considers that inflation is running at 7% and the
military is particularly exposed to rising costs for energy and
materials such as steel. [As inflation builds up, Pentagon is forced to
build down --- just as China is racing to expand its military
capabilities, Russia is threatening a major conflict in Eastern Europe
and relations with Iran deteriorate]{.underline}. The
[Biden]{.underline} administration [appears to be
recognizing,]{.underline} perhaps belatedly, [that rising prices pose a
severe threat]{.underline} to its domestic agenda and political
fortunes. [Inflation may]{.underline} also [have **nasty**
**geopolitical effects** in a world that hardly seemed stable
before]{.underline}.

### GOP Solves China

There may be a bipartisan consensus on [tougher US policy toward
China]{.underline}, but [Republican lawmakers]{.underline} tend to
[focus on China's negative behaviour and attributes, employing terms
like "propaganda", "spy" and "lie"]{.underline} on social media,
according to a Pew Research Centre analysis. The report released on
Wednesday also found that a relatively small number of Republicans
accounted for the majority of postings, often hammering away repeatedly
at the same themes. Meanwhile, Democratic counterparts focused more on
attacks on Asian-Americans. "It's not a coincidence that [Republicans
showed a lot of interest since 2019 in China]{.underline} and Democrats
on Asian-American issues," said Federico de Jesus, founder of FDJ

According to the Pew study, just 56 lawmakers out of 535 in Congress
generated 16,060 posts mentioning China or the Chinese people from
January 2020 through April 2021. Of those 56, 54 were Republican. The
offices of Republican senators Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas
and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, among the moctive Republican communicators
on China, did not respond to a request for comment. In cases where
lawmakers from both parties referred to China -- as with Covid-19, for
instance -- the language employed was often very different, Pew found.
Republicans tended to use terms such as "Communist Party", "\[hold\]
accountable", "investigation" and "lie", while Democrats tended to use
"Chinese virus" -- often in the context of decrying its use and the
prejudice it generated.Former president [Donald Trump and members of his
administration often referred to the pandemic as the "Chinese
virus"]{.underline}, "Wuhan virus" or "kung flu", a framing that
analysts said deflected attention from Trump's policy missteps and
fuelled attacks on Asian-Americans."[For Republicans in particular,
China serves as a convenient target for political attacks]{.underline},
often without regard for the impact those words may have on
Chinese-Americans and others," said Brett Bruen, president of Global
Situation Room, a crisis management firm. "We should talk about policy
differences and security concerns," added Bruen, formerly White House
head of global engagement. "Our leaders need to be much more responsible
in such a combustible environment."

The advertisement strikes an ominous tone from a familiar voice: Donald
Trump inveighing against American companies sending their jobs to China.
But the advertisement is from Trump foe and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who
is campaigning against David Perdue --- the candidate the former
president has picked to win in Georgia. The spot accuses Perdue of
outsourcing jobs in the private sector as a CEO before becoming a
candidate for the Senate in Georgia. "We tested a number of hits, and
that was the best-polling one --- the outsourcing to China," said Cody
Hall, Kemp's communications director. In Georgia, a state more than
7,000 miles from China, it has been a centerpiece of Kemp's campaign in
paid advertising and messaging. [Ties to China --- even spurious,
misleading or hyperbolic ones --- have become an albatross for GOP
candidates across the country]{.underline} in 2022 races and an
animating presence in campaign stops and advertisements, with much of
the [Republican Party holding increasingly negative views of
China]{.underline} after two years of the coronavirus and Trump's
rhetoric against the country. Campaign strategists and candidates in a
number of states said that tying candidates [to China has become a prime
attack in a GOP primary]{.underline} --- with candidates seeking to
differentiate themselves as they largely hew to Trump's political
agenda. In Pennsylvania, Mehmet Oz has repeatedly slashed his foe David
McCormick for conducting business deals with China as hedge fund CEO,
while McCormick and his allies have attacked Oz for making money off
Chinese state TV and using Chinese products for his companies. When
Trump criticized McCormick last Friday night at a rainy rally, he
lampooned him for being too kind to China in one of his most scorching
attacks. The attacks have stretched from Texas to Ohio to Missouri, with
candidates making aggressive and sometimes misleading claims about their
opponents' views on China. "There are China remnants in all these
primaries," said Tony Fabrizio, a prominent pollster who works for Trump
and is working in many of this year's contested primary states. "If you
[coddle China, or you are soft on China, that makes you not so much
America first and not so tough]{.underline}," Fabrizio said. "Being
tagged as soft on China is not a good thing. Trump focused and catalyzed
some of it. But China has been seen as the primary world foe for at
least the last decade or more." In a poll Fabrizio conducted earlier
this year, he said, Republican voters overwhelmingly viewed China as
more of a national security threat than Russia, even as Russia launched
missiles into Ukraine and killed thousands of civilians in a brutal land
war. A March
[poll](https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/partisan-divides-china-continue-grow)
by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found that [75 percent of
Republicans said China's development as a world power represented a
"critical threat" to U.S. interests]{.underline}, up from 67 percent in
2020 and 42 percent in 2018. It is a shift from decades past, when many
Republicans took a more conciliatory tone toward China. Michael
Pillsbury, one of Trump's informal advisers who was slated to be his
ambassador to the country if he had won a second term, said it once was
different. "It is something quite new --- Republicans used to be the
party of business and free trade," Pillsbury said. "And I remember
during the early considerations of President [Trump --- putting heavy
tariffs on China]{.underline} --- there were voices within the White
House and within the party that this goes against Republican
traditions." The current mood toward China, Pillsbury said, is darker
than it has been in decades in the United States. Pillsbury and others
note that many of the candidates launching the attacks have not
delivered succinct policy positions on what they would do differently,
and that some of the attacks seem to be fearmongering. There is a
confluence of reasons Republicans have escalated their anti-China
rhetoric, according to strategists and candidates. The party's
supporters listened to [Trump bad-mouth China throughout his term, even
as he struck a more conciliatory tone behind the scenes.]{.underline}
There is deep frustration among some Rust Belt states that Chinese
imports have cost American jobs and deflated towns. And there is
palpable and widespread blame on China for the coronavirus, which was
first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan. "The part of commonality
across the MAGA base is [being tough on China]{.underline}," said Jason
Miller, a longtime Trump adviser. "It [is interwoven in the trade
message]{.underline}, but it's more that Republicans see China as an
existential threat to all of Western civilization." Trump's team polled
last year on various messages for his rallies, and learned that
[attacking China was among the most popular with his supporters. Trump
started calling for reparations from China over the
coronavirus,]{.underline} receiving raucous cheers at his rallies ---
with no enforcement mechanism provided. In addition to Trump, who is
weighing a reelection bid, other potential 2024 presidential candidates
have focused on China, with former secretary of state Mike Pompeo and
others offering harsh rhetoric against the country. It has been much
less of an issue in Democratic primaries. In Pennsylvania, McCormick's
work at the hedge fund Bridgewater --- and its extensive business
dealings with China --- have been a key part of Oz's message. Before
running for the Senate, McCormick's Bridgewater "raised the equivalent
of \$1.25 billion for its third investment fund in China," according to
the Wall Street Journal.Let's go China!" two men paid by the Oz
campaign, dressed in vests and calling themselves "finance bros,"
cheered in one ad. They called him the "Wolf of Westport," a reference
to the affluent Connecticut town near New York City where Bridgewater is
headquartered.McCormick has been criticized frequently by Oz's campaign
for his 2007 remarks on China while serving as a top Treasury Department
official in the George W. Bush administration. "When China succeeds, the
United States succeeds," McCormick said, speaking in Beijing.Some
McCormick allies said they viewed his Chinese business ties as his
greatest disadvantage when he started the campaign; his first move was
to write an op-ed for Fox Business defending himself and promising to be
more aggressive on China."That's why I believe it is past time for
America's leaders to confront head-on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),
which poses the greatest economic and national security threat to the
United States," McCormick wrote.McCormick campaign spokesperson Jess
Szymanski said in a statement: "Dave's battle-tested experience will
make him one of the strongest Senators in Washington in [holding China
accountable and restoring pro-growth, America First
policies]{.underline}."For their part, McCormick and his team have put
together an extensive book of research attacking Oz for some for his
investments in China. For example, Oz made money when his television
show was syndicated in the country and acquiesced to Chinese state TV
rules in order for the show to be broadcast. "The Dr. Oz show has aired
in over 100 countries for over 13 years to provide life-changing health
information to millions of people across the globe," said Brittany
Yanick, a spokesperson for Oz. "Dr. Oz's stance on China is unequivocal
--- the Chinese Communist Party's malign actions both within their own
country and on the world stage are reprehensible." And when Oz launched
a bedding company, he contracted with a firm in China to make many of
its products. Pillows, mattresses and mattress toppers, among other
things, were all made in the country through a partnership with the
company Malouf. That allowed Oz to make between \$1 million and \$5
million, according to a financial disclosure he filed. Oz's campaign
defended the items being made in China, saying it was difficult to find
materials to make such products in the United States.

#### Republicans will reinstate Trump administration sanctions against China

Institute's Kleptocracy Initiative, "Republicans Can Embrace Much of

Even in the fractious current Congress, [Republicans have been
**leaders**]{.underline} in what must be one of the last bipartisan
initiatives with any serious momentum, as evidenced by the launch of a
bipartisan Caucus Against Foreign Corruption and Kleptocracy in June and
of the U.S.-led Interparliamentary Alliance Against Kleptocracy in
December. Rep. [Maria Salazar]{.underline} (R., Fla.), whose family
suffered at the hands of kleptocratic regimes in Cuba and Nicaragua,
[has become a **powerful voice** for adjusting U.S.
anti-money-laundering regulations]{.underline} to end abuse of the
American financial system. "These are not faraway problems for the
United States; corrupt money also destroys American lives," she said at
a recent hearing. Republicans' role has often been to restrain
Democratic colleagues from measures that impose harsh regulation on U.S.
businesses or violate reasonable privacy expectations. A recent
bipartisan success: Included in the January defense authorization was a
ban on anonymous shell companies. The bill mandated the creation of a
U.S. corporate beneficial-ownership register accessible only to American
law enforcement and banks, as opposed to the open public registers of
Europe. Mr. Biden has done more than any previous president to highlight
the threat of authoritarian kleptocracy. But he also needlessly
surrendered Afghanistan to a theocratic narco-gang, green-lit Russia's
Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and nixed sanctions on the so-called Navalny 35
group of Vladimir Putin's henchmen. He now appears poised to abandon
Ukraine, which has persevered against Kremlin-backed oligarchy. The
Treasury Department has yet to impose sanctions on anyone approaching
the stature of Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. A [future Republican
administration and Congress could build on the Biden
initiative]{.underline}. They could acknowledge that the biggest
kleptocracy of all is run by the Chinese Communist Party. Egregious
intellectual-property theft, economic blackmail of foreign countries and
businesses, rampant bribery on the Belt and Road Initiative: China's
emergence as a global power shows what happens when thieves hold the
reins of the world's second-largest economy. Meanwhile, the
Cuban-Venezuelan criminal enterprise continues to consume Latin America,
and Tehran uses whatever cash it can get to spread terror across the
Middle East. Buoyed by stronger anti-money-laundering defenses at home[,
Republicans could take a **powerful offensive line** against these
regimes by **reinstating the maximum pressure** campaigns of the Trump
administration---deploying the **full force of U.S. sanctions** and law
enforcement against dictators who rob their own people and use the
proceeds to threaten global security.]{.underline}

#### Republicans will not just prioritize China, but will be the [toughest]{.underline} on China 

**Murphy 22** (Rory Murphy is the vice president of government affairs
at the U.S. China Business Council, "U.S. midterm elections and China
policy", SupChina,

Sure. Let's assume [Republicans]{.underline} take at least one chamber
of Congress. They'[ve made it]{.underline} quite [clear that **China is
not going to go away as an issue**]{.underline}. [The House Republican
Task Force]{.underline} on China put out a report, I believe, last
September[**. Outlines** a lot of their priorities,]{.underline} what
they would like to pursue should they be in charge. I think I would
encourage all of you to read through that. There's [a lot of
ideas]{.underline} in there and I think all of them [are on the
table]{.underline}. Anchoring that effort in the House next year would
be this assuming the outbound investment proposal we discussed earlier
does not make it into a final China package this year. [It'll likely be
the **anchor** of]{.underline} some legislative [effort on China next
year]{.underline}. That is our expectation. From a business perspective,
there's a constant political risk, reputational risk doing business.
[There's an increase of interest]{.underline}, it seems, among lawmakers
of both parties, but I'd say [**probably more so Republicans** to call
out companies, call out institutions on issues related to
China]{.underline}. You have in the Senate, regardless of who seemingly
every [Senate Republican]{.underline} i[s]{.underline}
[position]{.underline}ing [themselves]{.underline} to run for the White
House in 2024, and that creates a dynamic where lawmakers are trying to
position themselves [as the toughest on China]{.underline}. And so,
[there's **arms race of policies**]{.underline} that we'll need to
contend with. From a business perspective, that creates a lot of
uncertainties. There's a dynamic where it's hard to push back on bad
policies, even if you are a lawmaker who wants to get the policy right.
The second that somebody puts out a policy that's objectively bad, and
there's a lot of good policies, right policies that should be pursued,
but some are, we would say objectively bad, it's hard to question it,
let alone oppose it because you're at risk of being labeled as "weak on
China." From a political calculus, it just makes things really tricky.
So, there's a reputational risk for businesses that there could be an
increase of them being called out outside of the legislative process.
Then this constant uncertainty of what bills are going to be introduced,
and how will they be enacted into law? It's harder to forecast what will
be approved, what won't be than it was five, six years ago.

Election Outlook

[The probability of a GOP sweep has increased but the competitiveness of
some elections in November will depend upon the]{.underline} identity of
each party's [nominees.]{.underline} Procedural rules in the Senate
prevent narrow majorities from exercising broad discretion over
legislation without the consent of the minority. There are two
exceptions: judicial appointments and budget reconciliation.

[Policy Implications]{.underline}

Taxes: No substantive changes to tax law but [the R&D tax credit will be
addressed if it is not already addressed in 2022]{.underline}. Companies
now have to amortize R&D expenses over 5 years instead of the year it
was made.² [Defense: Spending increases]{.underline} more
[significantly]{.underline} under this scenario. Bipartisan consensus on
[an adversarial posture toward China]{.underline} persists. [The R&D tax
credit is an important issue for]{.underline} the [defense]{.underline}
industry under all three scenarios. [Agriculture]{.underline}: Enacted
by Congress roughly once every five years. A new [bill will pass but GOP
may demand cuts to s]{.underline}upplemental [n]{.underline}utrition
[a]{.underline}ssistance [p]{.underline}rograms. Climate: Nothing
substantive passes. [Debt Limit]{.underline}: Contentious [negotiations
before default]{.underline} deadline. Limit is raised but [GOP demands
concession on social spending.]{.underline}

Last month's vote in the U.S. Congress to appropriate \$40 billion in
additional military and budgetary assistance for Ukraine laid bare
fissures in the Republican congressional caucus: 11 of 50 Senate
Republicans voted against the bill, as did 57 of 208 House Republicans.
Was the Ukraine vote a harbinger of Republican national security
squabbles to come? Was it a partisan vote against anything associated
with President Joe Biden? Or was it a one-off reflecting a poorly
drafted bill with too much extraneous baggage? More importantly, who
will hold the foreign-policy reins in the likely Republican House (and
possibly Senate) majority to come in 2023---the isolationists or the
internationalists? [Political pundits agree Republicans are likely to
win back the House of Representatives and have a good shot at the Senate
in the November 2022 midterm elections.]{.underline} That could---caucus
permitting---propel House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to the
speakership and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to the post of
majority leader. Of the two, McConnell is the known quantity---an
experienced legislator and parliamentarian and an old-school
internationalist whose foreign-policy views were forged in the crucible
of the Cold War. McCarthy, not so much. Indeed, it's probably most
accurate to say his foreign policy was forged in the crucible of former
President Donald Trump. As previous Republican speakers have learned to
their displeasure, the Republican Party in today's House is less a
caucus and more a raucous battle for primacy. Former Speaker John
Boehner struggled against rebellious Tea Party upstarts, his successor
Paul Ryan struggled against the self-named Freedom Caucus, and McCarthy
is unlikely to have much fun either. In the minority, the Republican
Party tends---emphasis intended---to stand together because the
Democratic speaker and the executive in the White House are deemed
public enemies No. 1 and No. 2. But with the majority comes the battle
to control the agenda. Domestic policy will likely dominate the
politicking in Congress: inflation, crime, education, the border. But
[Russia's invasion of Ukraine, like so many conflicts before it, has
proved that as much as politicians wish to focus on "nation building
here at home," global realities intrude]{.underline}. [Ukraine is the
tip of the iceberg, but Republicans have their eye on plenty of other
issues as well, includin]{.underline}g relations with
[China]{.underline}, the question of defending **[Taiwan]{.underline}**,
the continued isolation of [**Russia, the Middle East** (think **energy,
Iran, and Israel**), and]{.underline}, more broadly, **[defense
spending]{.underline}**. But before the substance of the foreign-policy
challenge hits the House and Senate floors, the ideological question
merits examination. American Enterprise Institute scholar Colin Dueck
divides the Republican Party's foreign policy into three schools:
foreign-policy activists, foreign-policy hard-liners, and foreign-policy
noninterventionists. Looking back, it's clear that so-called
foreign-policy activists dominated Republican national security
policymaking for much of the post-World War II era. These were the
leaders who believed, as both Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W.
Bush regularly underscored, that the United States is not simply one
nation among many but that it is a beacon of freedom to the world, a
"shining city on a hill." Foreign-policy activists underwrote the Reagan
Doctrine, the principle that the United States should lend a hand to all
those hoping to halt the advance of communism wherever they were,
including in Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Angola, El Salvador, and Grenada.
Bush faced different challenges, but his underlying faith in U.S. power
and values was similar. Rather than fighting communism, what Bush dubbed
his "Freedom Agenda" took on the tyrannies that he believed fueled
Salafi-jihadis. Yet his efforts were neither clearly thought through nor
appropriately resourced. Worse yet, Bush could not convincingly argue
that he was advancing U.S. national interests in every case. For the
activist school, Bush's Iraq War proved to be their swan song. Though
the Iraq War offered an "I told you so" moment for the Republican
Party's isolationist wing, its immediate beneficiaries were President
Barack Obama and the Democratic Party's own "End the endless wars"
crowd---or so it seemed at first. But the intervening years offered the
Republican Party's noninterventionists ample fodder: the disastrous war
in Libya and the horrifying killing of a U.S. ambassador in Benghazi,
the withdrawal from Iraq and the resulting rise of the Islamic State,
the civil war in Syria and the ensuing cataclysmic refugee crisis. These
crises were not the primary reason for Trump's election, but they didn't
hurt his campaign. Rather, they---together with Obama's self-labeled
signature foreign-policy achievement, the Iran nuclear deal---offered an
opportunity for Trump. "Donald Trump's political achievement in 2016 was
to sense the possibility for a new \[Republican\] coalition unseen since
before World War II," Dueck writes. "He did this not by reiterating
libertarian foreign-policy preferences. Rather, he combined
non-interventionist criticism of 'endless wars' with hardline stands on
China, jihadist terrorism, anti-American dictatorships in Latin America,
and US defense spending." [This is a sweet spot for **Republican foreign
policy,** and understanding the reluctant internationalism of most of
the party's voters---a repudiation of the embarrassed anti-Americanism
of the Democratic Party's far left and the activist internationalism
that has heretofore characterized the Republican Party leadership---will
be key to geolocating a new Republican Congress's preferred national
security polic]{.underline}y. [A unifying theme for the Republican Party
will be the **challenge presented by China**.]{.underline} It sells well
with the base, and with trade liberalization off the table for the
moment (for both parties), the question of China will likely come down
to economic disengagement and Beijing's threat to Taiwan. A case in
point is a recent letter co-written by Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore
Capito (respectively the Democratic and Republican senators from West
Virginia) urging Biden to include Taiwan in his newly proposed
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Republican signatories to the letter
included James Risch, who is likely to be the chair of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee in a new Republican-held Senate; Roger
Wicker, the likely chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee; Marco
Rubio, the likely chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence;
and most of the Republican members of the current Senate Appropriations
Committee. Notably, several of the Senate's more ardent Trump
supporters, including Marsha Blackburn and Kevin Cramer, also joined the
letter. (A similar House effort was also joined by likely future
national security heavyweights, including probable House Foreign Affairs
Committee Chair Michael McCaul.) [**Defense spending** will be another
key theme for the Republican Party.]{.underline} House and Senate
Republicans have repeatedly slammed Biden's defense spending as
inadequate to address the country's many national security challenges
and have only escalated those charges since Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. McConnell has called for a 5 percent increase in defense
spending above inflation, and McCarthy has been equally energetic. Both
understand---as Trump did---that investing in the military can be cast
as a deterrent as well as a down payment on victory in any eventual
conflict. And here again, the base is with them. [Ditto for energy
security]{.underline}: While there is a bipartisan constituency for
pivoting away from the Middle East---and a growing bipartisan opposition
to renewing the Iran nuclear deal---Republicans are less focused on
climate change issues and more on basic pocketbook challenges. That will
mean [more enthusiasm for restoring American energy independence,
avoiding unnecessary bickering with Saudi Arabia (]{.underline}still a
major swing producer of oil), an[d easing regulations on U.S. oil and
gas production.]{.underline} But what about Ukraine and cases like it?
What about those 11 in the Senate and the 57 in the House? What about
the conservative powerhouse think tank the Heritage Foundation and its
political action committee drawing a line in the sand against the \$40
billion Ukraine aid package? Like Heritage, Sen. Mike Braun finessed his
opposition based not on the policy of aiding Ukraine but on the cost of
doing so and the spiraling U.S. debt. Sen. Rand Paul, a perennial
opponent of U.S. overseas engagement, pinned his "no" vote on the lack
of an inspector general in the bill to oversee how the funds are spent.
That's fair enough, but it's hard to picture every one of those "no"
votes switching tack if presented with a better or cleaner bill---not
when the Republican Party's rising stars include the likes of Senate
candidate J.D. Vance, who during his campaign said, "I gotta be honest
with you, I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or
another." It's relatively easy to predict that a Republican majority
will continue to support arming and aiding Ukraine, because the vote has
already happened. And though a significant minority of the Republican
caucus voted no, it was a minority. But there are harder cases (though
not just for the Republicans): [the looming Chinese threat to Taiwan,
for one.]{.underline} Sure, there's a majority in both houses for
including Taiwan in trading arrangements, and there are vocal advocates
in both chambers for ending the U.S. policy of "strategic ambiguity"
toward Taipei. But where will the Republican Party be on defending
Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack? Will isolationists on both left
and right actually have the power to steer a course? On its face, the
answer appears to be no, but the devil is, proverbially, in the details.
Sanctions on China would hit the Republican base hard, raising costs for
basic goods even higher. As with all such crystal ball gazing, sorting
the powerful from the merely loud will be a chore. Republican Rep.
Marjorie Taylor Greene is ever-so-vocal and enjoys a substantial Twitter
following, but she has little clout in the House of Representatives.
Paul is consistently isolationist, but few ask how he will vote as they
decide their stance on major issues. More importantly, the majority of
the Republican Party is not actually with them. Case in point: The TV
host Tucker Carlson, pocket deity of Trump nostalgics, initially came
out swinging against NATO's condemnations of Russian President Vladimir
Putin's attack on Ukraine, but he soon tempered his position once it
became clear that ranging himself on the side of the Russian dictator
was a losing cause. Similarly, while all eyes focus on the Vances and
Greenes, there actually remains a strong hawkish contingent in the
Republican Party that is well represented on Capitol Hill, including by
Sens. Tom Cotton, Rubio, and Ted Cruz, as well as Reps. Mike Gallagher,
Elise Stefanik, and likely incoming House Armed Services Committee Chair
Mike Turner, among others. Although these members may not be
interventionists in the style of George W. Bush, [there should be no
question that they are national **security hawks** keen on defending
both U.S. interests and U.S. allies. That will almost certainly mean
efforts to **increase the defense budget**; pressure to increase the
quality, consistency, and speed of arms deliveries to Ukraine; and an
even **harder line on China**, potentially including additional
sanctions on Beijing (notwithstanding grumbling from certain
quarters]{.underline}).

[Events in Libya are a further reminder for Americans]{.underline} that
we [stand at a crossroads in our continuing evolution as the world\'s
**sole full-service superpower**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, we are
increasingly seeking change without cost, and shirking from risk because
we are tired of the responsibility. We don\'t know who we are anymore,
and our president is a big part of that problem. Instead of leading us,
he explains to us. Barack Obama would have us believe that he is
practicing strategic patience. But many experts and ordinary citizens
alike have concluded that he is actually beset by strategic incoherence
\-- in effect, a man overmatched by the job. It is worth first examining
the larger picture: [We live in a time of arguably the greatest
structural change in the global order yet endured,]{.underline} [with
this historical moment\'s most amazing feature being its]{.underline}
relative and absolute **[lack of mass violence]{.underline}**. That is
something to consider when Americans contemplate military intervention
in Libya, because if we do take the step to prevent larger-scale killing
by engaging in some killing of our own, we will not be adding to some
fantastically imagined global death count stemming from the ongoing
\"megalomania\" and \"evil\" of American \"empire.\" We\'ll be engaging
in the same sort of system-administering activity that has marked our
stunningly successful stewardship of global order since World War II.
Let me be more blunt: [As the guardian of globalization, **the U.S.
military has been the greatest force for peace the world has ever
known**. Had America been removed from the global dynamics that governed
the 20th century]{.underline}, the [mass murder never would have
ended]{.underline}. Indeed, it\'s entirely conceivable [there would now
be **no identifiable human civilization left,** once nuclear weapons
entered the killing equation.]{.underline} But [the world did not keep
sliding down that path of **perpetual war.**]{.underline} [Instead,
America stepped up and changed everything by ushering in our
now-perpetual **great-power peace**]{.underline}. We introduced the
international liberal trade order known as globalization and played
loyal Leviathan over its spread. What resulted was the collapse of
empires, an explosion of democracy, the persistent spread of human
rights, the liberation of women, the doubling of life expectancy, a
roughly 10-fold increase in adjusted global GDP and a profound and
persistent reduction in battle deaths from state-based conflicts. That
is what American \"hubris\" actually delivered. Please remember that the
next time some TV pundit sells you the image of \"unbridled\" American
military power as the cause of global disorder instead of its cure. With
self-deprecation bordering on self-loathing, we now imagine a
post-American world that is anything but. Just watch who scatters and
who steps up as the Facebook revolutions erupt across the Arab world.
While we might imagine ourselves the status quo power, we remain the
world\'s most vigorously revisionist force. As for the sheer \"evil\"
that is our military-industrial complex, again, let\'s examine what the
world looked like before that establishment reared its ugly head. The
last great period of global structural change was the first half of the
20th century, a period that saw a death toll of about 100 million across
two world wars. That comes to an average of 2 million deaths a year in a
world of approximately 2 billion souls. Today, with far more
comprehensive worldwide reporting, researchers report an average of less
than 100,000 battle deaths annually in a world fast approaching 7
billion people. Though admittedly crude, these [calculations suggest a
90 percent absolute drop and a 99 percent relative drop in deaths due to
war. We are]{.underline} [clearly headed for a world order characterized
by multipolarity, something the American-birthed system was designed to
both encourage and accommodate. But given how things turned out the last
time we collectively faced such a fluid structure, we would do well to
keep U.S. power,]{.underline} in all of its forms, deeply embedded in
the geometry to come. To continue the historical survey, after salvaging
Western Europe from its half-century of civil war, the U.S. emerged as
the progenitor of a new, far more just form of globalization \-- one
based on actual free trade rather than colonialism. America then
successfully replicated globalization further in East Asia over the
second half of the 20th century, setting the stage for the Pacific
Century now unfolding.

[Understanding the complicated relationship between energy, climate and
security is vital both]{.underline} to the study of international
relations [and to ensure the continued survival of a world increasingly
threatened by environmental change]{.underline}. Climate change is
largely caused by burning fossil fuels for energy, but while
[discussions on the climate consider the role of energy, energy security
debates largely overlook climate concerns]{.underline}. This article
traces the separation [between energy and climate through an analysis of
US energy security discourse]{.underline} and policy. It shows that
[energy security is continually constructed as national
security]{.underline}, which enables very [particular policy
choices]{.underline} and prioritises it above climate concerns. Thus, in
many cases, policies undertaken in the [name of energy security
contribute directly to climate insecurity]{.underline}. The article
argues that the failure to consider [securing the climate as inherently
linked to energy security]{.underline} is not just problematic, but,
[given global warming, potentially harmful]{.underline}. Consequently,
[any approach to dealing with climate change has to begin by rethinking
energy security and security more broadly, as national (energy) security
politics no longer provides security]{.underline} in any meaningful
sense.

#### Republicans will solve climate change and inflation problems with energy legislation. 

**Josh Siegel '22** (Josh Siegel was a reporter at the Washington
Examiner he's been the lead author of Daily on Energy, "House
Republicans to introduce climate change strategy with eye on midterms,"

<https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/01/house-republicans-to-introduce-climate-change-strategy-with-eye-on-midterms-00036481>,
6/1/2022)

House Republicans are preparing to release a six-part strategy to try to
tame surging gasoline prices and to combat climate change that calls for
increasing production of all types of energy and sets no greenhouse gas
targets. The plan to be released Thursday is the product of an "energy,
climate, and conservation task force" created by top House Republican
Kevin McCarthy last year that he tasked with devising a policy agenda to
address climate change [**should Republicans capture the** House in the
2022 **midterm elections**]{.underline}. "We are
**[creat]{.underline}i**ng [a clear coherent **energy strategy** that
returns the U.S. to an **emissions reduction trajectory** as opposed to
what we are seeing under the Biden administration, which is failing
every test, whether it be affordability, emissions or
security,"]{.underline} Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.), the chair of the
17-member task force, told POLITICO in an exclusive interview previewing
the plan. The strategy released by House Republicans contains few new
policy ideas and is meant instead to provide a high-level overview of
how [the party would **address** the challenges of **record-high energy
prices worsened by Russia's war in Ukraine while reducing global
emissions**]{.underline}. The strategy is consistent with McCarthy's
effort in recent years to develop the party's climate change platform
and messaging to challenge Democrats and the Biden administration, with
an eye toward winning support from young people and suburban voters who
polls show are increasingly concerned worried about the issue. The GOP
is betting that promoting private sector innovation to curb emissions
without targeting fossil fuels that are the biggest source of greenhouse
gases will enable the party to win competitive oil and gas producing
House districts won by Democrats in 2020. The task force report, shared
with POLITICO, contains six pillars: "[Unlock America's Resources,"
"Beat China and Russia," "Let America Build," "Build Resilient
Communities," "American Innovation" and "Conservation with a
Purpose."]{.underline} Without those themes, Republicans aim to pursue
the party's well-trodden policy ideas such as promoting domestic
production and export of "all of the above" energy resources,
[**including oil and gas, along with zero-carbon technologies such as
wind, solar, small modular nuclear reactors, hydrogen and carbon
capture**.]{.underline} They also want to streamline permitting to
reduce obstacles to [**building clean energy** and traditional energy
infrastructure, including pipelines, LNG terminals and mines to produce
critical minerals.]{.underline} House Republicans say they plan to
[introduce new legislation]{.underline} next Congress that corresponds
to each of the six policy areas should the GOP take control of the
chamber. The report, however, is also notable in what it does not
include. House Republicans continue to resist setting a specific
emissions reduction target. They oppose policies to reduce fossil fuel
use, including regulations, taxes, or mandates. And Graves said House
Republicans, unlike at least some GOP counterparts in the Senate, are
skeptical of the government extending and expanding clean energy tax
credits that the renewable industry says are critical to helping them
deploy zero-carbon power at the scale needed to address climate change.
"Are we open to looking at strategies that nudge technologies to
economic sustainability? Yes. But a lot of that can be achieved through
R&D partnering with innovators," said Graves, who represents an oil and
gas district experiencing sea level rise and is currently the ranking
GOP member of the Democratic-led Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.
In leaning too much into fossil fuels to counter Biden's more aggressive
climate agenda, Republicans risk turning off swing voters in states and
districts already feeling the effects of climate change, with forecasts
predicting a brutal summer for wildfires, extreme heat and drought.

### Impact -- Energy Security

#### Energy security key to the hege -- both military and economic strength depend on energy independence.

Dan **Brouillette '21**. 15th Secretary of the U.S. Department of
Energy. Secretary Brouillette has three decades of experience in both
the public and private sector. "Economic and National Security Impacts
under a Hydraulic Fracturing Ban: Report to the President". United
States Department of Energy. January 2021.

accessed 7-13-2021

The U.S. shale revolution has been the single most significant
contributor to enhancing U.S. energy security. [As a result of U.S.
oil]{.underline} and natural gas production [strength and resilience,
the U.S. is far less impacted by global oil price shocks]{.underline},
consumers and manufacturers enjoy the benefits of reliable, affordable
power, and **[energy is an important foreign policy]{.underline}**
**[tool]{.underline}**. Instituting a ban on hydraulic fracturing would
introduce several national security uncertainties. Fundamentally,
[energy security can be defined in a national security context using a
three-tiered approach to national security itself.]{.underline} That is,
national security as the functionality of military capabilities and
security services at the primary level; as the functioning of critical
domestic energy supplies and services at the secondary level; and as
economic well-being and prosperity at the most removed, longest-term
level. 66 A ban of HF would affect all three levels of this national
security paradigm. While the ban itself would not directly induce a
lessening of the national security posture, it would introduce more
uncertainties, requiring additional scenario planning as the U.S. and
our allies' reliance on foreign oil and natural gas would increase. On
the most basic level, [national security assets are still largely
dependent on liquid hydrocarbon fuel sources to power the engines of
U.S. military vehicles and technologies]{.underline}. Aircraft require
the lion's-share of these resources, meaning that the bulk of the U.S.
military's forward-projection capabilities are reliant upon affordable
and abundant fuel sources. Likewise, [ground and sea-based military
capabilities]{.underline} (except for nuclear-powered aircraft carriers
and submarines) [are also dependent on ready access to these
fuels.]{.underline} From a training and readiness perspective to
power-posture and actual combat operations, maintaining a steady and
secure supply of fuels is necessary for the modern military and security
apparatus. Activities, such as a ban, that would reduce the secure and
reliable domestic source of these fuels would insert uncertainty into
the energy supply chain. [Beyond the primary level, the safety and
reliability of the broader energy supply infrastructure and resources
also plays a key role in overall national security.]{.underline} Severe
supply disruptions to the overall economy, whether from natural
disasters, confrontational tradecraft, or even open hostilities, could
result in domestic unrest. There are several potential chokepoints in
international trade routes, largely shipping lanes that could be used to
cut off fuel supplies to the U.S. economy in the short-to-mid-term.
Additionally, and less dramatically, a trade embargo, like the 1970's
OPEC oil embargo, could have a similar effect. While these outcomes
would not directly result from a HF ban, increases in reliance on
foreign sources of fuel would expose and exacerbate vulnerabilities.
Finally, a thriving and growing economy provides the most significant
and most enduring bulwark against national security threats. As was
stated in the United States Senate's Global Economic Security Strategy
of 2019, "the national security of the United States depends in large
part on a vibrant, growing, and secure United States economy;"67 As has
been described in detail throughout the report, a potential HF ban is
projected to have an impeding effect on overall economic growth, and to
ultimately reduce the number of jobs, wages and tax revenues collected.
These effects would compound over time, eventually weakening the economy
and national security. Enacting a nationwide ban on the technology that
has unlocked America's energy revolution jeopardizes newfound gains in
energy security and poses a significant threat to America's national
security. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling are directly
responsible for most domestic oil and natural gas production. Taking
away hydraulic fracturing technology from America's oil and natural gas
industry removes the primary technique needed to efficiently and
responsibly extract abundant U.S. energy resources. [Without new wells
brought online, U.S. natural gas and oil production would rapidly fall,
reversing the past decade\'s energy security gains. Importantly, the
U.S. would lose its energy independence, and, since demand for reliable,
affordable energy would remain, America would again turn to the Middle
East and Russia for imports. An important asset in diplomacy would be
sidelined and allies across the globe -- from Southeast Asia to Europe
and South America -- would be cut off from a valuable, trusted energy
trading partner]{.underline}.

The [tensions stoked by]{.underline} the [[assertive

**[spark]{.mark} a political or military incident** that might set off
[a chain reaction leading to]{.mark} a]{.underline} **[large-scale
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Historically, powerful rivalries nearly
always lead to at least skirmishes, if not a full-blown war. [The
anomalous Cold War era]{.underline} **[spared]{.underline}** the United
States and Soviet Russia a direct conflict, largely from concerns that
one would trigger a **[nuclear exchange destroying]{.underline}** both
states and much of [**the world**. Such a repetition **might** reoccur
in the unfolding]{.underline} three-cornered [geopolitical
world]{.underline}. It seems safe to acknowledge that an ascendant China
and a resurgent Russia will persist in their geo-strategic ambitions.
What Is To Be Done? The first marching order is to dodge any kind of
perpetual war of the sort that George Orwell outlined in "1984," which
engulfed the three super states of Eastasia, Eurasia, and Oceania, and
made possible the totalitarian Big Brother regime. A long-running Cold
War-type confrontation would almost certainly take another form than the
one that ran from 1945 until the downfall of the Soviet Union. What
prescriptions can be offered in the face of the escalating competition
among the three global powers? First, [[by **staying militarily and
economically strong**, the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will]{.mark} have the resources to
**[deter]{.mark}** its peers' **hawkish behavior** that might otherwise
**trigger**]{.underline} a **[[major conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Judging by the history of the Cold War, [the coming strategic chess
match with Russia and China will prove tense and
demanding]{.underline}---[since]{.underline} **[all the countries boast
nuclear arms]{.underline}** and long-range ballistic missiles. Next,
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should widen and sustain
willing **coalitions** of **partners**]{.underline}, something at which
America excels, and at which China and Russia fail conspicuously.
[[There can be **little room for error**]{.mark} in]{.underline} fraught
**[crises [among nuclear-weaponized]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
**[hostile [powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Short- and long-term
standoffs are likely, as they were during the Cold War. Thus, [the
playbook]{.underline}, in part, [involves a **waiting game** in which
each power looks to its rivals to suffer]{.underline} grievous [internal
problems]{.underline} which could entail a collapse, as happened to the
Soviet Union.

(R-Ga.). [But everything we know about modern politics suggests that the
best way --- maybe the **only way** --- for a Democrat to be reelected
is to also be the last guy standing between the broad American
electorate and a whole lot of Republican crazy.]{.underline} There's a
pattern here. [After narrowly winning the presidency in 1992, Bill
Clinton immediately set about]{.underline} trying to rewrite the social
contract and [embroiling himself in distracting cultural issues. He
became the first Democrat in almost 50 years to]{.underline} [lose
control](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Presidents-Coinciding/Party-Government/)
[of both chambers in the ensuing midterm elections. Clinton]{.underline}
[moderated his
message](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1995/11/28/how-to-triangulate-an-oval-office/3ecaa027-820c-4e4b-b7e7-e45bf0e584c1/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13)

[shutdown](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/09/30/1995-government-shutdown-federal-workers/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13)
[of the federal government. He was reelected easily.]{.underline} Twelve
years later, Barack [Obama swept into office on another Democratic wave,
went on his own government-expansion bender and suffered his own
stinging midterm rebuke. **Recast**]{.underline} as the lone bulwark
[**against Republican radicalism,** Obama was returned to
office]{.underline} by a comfortable margin. Biden, similarly, has spent
most of the past two years trying to satisfy the ascendant left of his
party --- the cringy-sounding "Squad" and so forth --- in a mostly vain
effort to enact some kind of sweeping agenda. The party in charge has
spent inordinate amounts of time talking about police reform and college
loan forgiveness, while the rest of the country worries far more about
rising crime and the [price of
gas](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/06/01/gas-tax-holiday/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16)
and groceries. No one at the White House will say this out loud,
certainly, but the fact is [that **losing control** of the
House]{.underline} ([and]{.underline} possibly the [Senate)]{.underline}
in November [would instantly **make** the presidency a more
manageable]{.underline} job. It would curb the power of the
Sanders-Warren wing, freeing Biden to pursue the kind of mainstream
liberal agenda --- his landmark infrastructure law being a good example
--- that the voters thought they were getting in the first place.
Meanwhile, a newly emboldened Republican majority --- like space junk
orbiting its Trumpian star --- will gravitate even more strongly toward
antidemocratic themes of election fraud and intolerance. [Like Clinton
and Obama before him, Biden will have the chance to **rebrand himself**
as the grown-up standing firm against bullies and
extremists.]{.underline}

[Events in Libya are a further reminder for Americans]{.underline} that
we [stand at a crossroads in our continuing evolution as the world\'s
**sole full-service superpower**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, we are
increasingly seeking change without cost, and shirking from risk because
we are tired of the responsibility. We don\'t know who we are anymore,
and our president is a big part of that problem. Instead of leading us,
he explains to us. Barack Obama would have us believe that he is
practicing strategic patience. But many experts and ordinary citizens
alike have concluded that he is actually beset by strategic incoherence
\-- in effect, a man overmatched by the job. It is worth first examining
the larger picture: [We live in a time of arguably the greatest
structural change in the global order yet endured,]{.underline} [with
this historical moment\'s most amazing feature being its]{.underline}
relative and absolute **[lack of mass violence]{.underline}**. That is
something to consider when Americans contemplate military intervention
in Libya, because if we do take the step to prevent larger-scale killing
by engaging in some killing of our own, we will not be adding to some
fantastically imagined global death count stemming from the ongoing
\"megalomania\" and \"evil\" of American \"empire.\" We\'ll be engaging
in the same sort of system-administering activity that has marked our
stunningly successful stewardship of global order since World War II.
Let me be more blunt: [As the guardian of globalization, **the U.S.
military has been the greatest force for peace the world has ever
known**. Had America been removed from the global dynamics that governed
the 20th century]{.underline}, the [mass murder never would have
ended]{.underline}. Indeed, it\'s entirely conceivable [there would now
be **no identifiable human civilization left,** once nuclear weapons
entered the killing equation.]{.underline} But [the world did not keep
sliding down that path of **perpetual war.**]{.underline} [Instead,
America stepped up and changed everything by ushering in our
now-perpetual **great-power peace**]{.underline}. We introduced the
international liberal trade order known as globalization and played
loyal Leviathan over its spread. What resulted was the collapse of
empires, an explosion of democracy, the persistent spread of human
rights, the liberation of women, the doubling of life expectancy, a
roughly 10-fold increase in adjusted global GDP and a profound and
persistent reduction in battle deaths from state-based conflicts. That
is what American \"hubris\" actually delivered. Please remember that the
next time some TV pundit sells you the image of \"unbridled\" American
military power as the cause of global disorder instead of its cure. With
self-deprecation bordering on self-loathing, we now imagine a
post-American world that is anything but. Just watch who scatters and
who steps up as the Facebook revolutions erupt across the Arab world.
While we might imagine ourselves the status quo power, we remain the
world\'s most vigorously revisionist force. As for the sheer \"evil\"
that is our military-industrial complex, again, let\'s examine what the
world looked like before that establishment reared its ugly head. The
last great period of global structural change was the first half of the
20th century, a period that saw a death toll of about 100 million across
two world wars. That comes to an average of 2 million deaths a year in a
world of approximately 2 billion souls. Today, with far more
comprehensive worldwide reporting, researchers report an average of less
than 100,000 battle deaths annually in a world fast approaching 7
billion people. Though admittedly crude, these [calculations suggest a
90 percent absolute drop and a 99 percent relative drop in deaths due to
war. We are]{.underline} [clearly headed for a world order characterized
by multipolarity, something the American-birthed system was designed to
both encourage and accommodate. But given how things turned out the last
time we collectively faced such a fluid structure, we would do well to
keep U.S. power,]{.underline} in all of its forms, deeply embedded in
the geometry to come. To continue the historical survey, after salvaging
Western Europe from its half-century of civil war, the U.S. emerged as
the progenitor of a new, far more just form of globalization \-- one
based on actual free trade rather than colonialism. America then
successfully replicated globalization further in East Asia over the
second half of the 20th century, setting the stage for the Pacific
Century now unfolding.

Hopkins University\'s School of Advanced International Studies and a

American Grand Strategy in the Age of Trump.\" Page 129-133\]

[Since World War II, the United States has had a military **second to
none**]{.underline}. Since the Cold War, [America has **committed** to
having]{.underline} **[overwhelming military primacy]{.underline}**. The
idea, as George W. Bush declared in 2002, that America must possess
"strengths beyond challenge" has featured in every major U.S. strategy
document for a quarter century; it has also been reflected in concrete
terms.6

From the early 1990s, for example, the [**U**nited **S**tates
consistently accounted for around 35 to 45 percent of world defense
spending and maintained **peerless global power-projection
capabilities**]{.underline}.7 Perhaps more important, U.S. [primacy was
also unrivaled in key overseas **strategic
regions**]{.underline}---**[Europe, East Asia, the Middle
East]{.underline}**. [From **thrashing Saddam**]{.underline} Hussein's
million-man Iraqi military [during Operation Desert Storm, to
deploying---with impunity---two carrier strike groups off Taiwan during
the China-Taiwan crisis of 1995-- 96, Washington has been able to
project military power **superior** to anything a **regional rival**
could employ even **on its own geopolitical doorstep.**]{.underline}

This **[military dominance]{.underline}** [has constituted
the]{.underline} [**hard-power backbone** of an ambitious global
strategy.]{.underline} After the Cold War, U.S. [policymakers committed
to averting a return to the **unstable multipolarity** of earlier eras,
and to perpetuating the more favorable unipolar order.]{.underline}
[They committed to building on the successes of the postwar era by
further advancing **liberal political values** and an open international
**economy**, and to **suppressing** international scourges such as
**rogue states**, **nuclear proliferation**, and catastrophic
**terrorism**.]{.underline} And because they recognized that military
force remained the ultima ratio regum, [they understood the]{.underline}
**[centrality]{.underline}** [of military preponderance]{.underline}.

[Washington would **need** the **military power**]{.underline}
[necessary to **underwrite** worldwide **alliance commitments**. It
would have to preserve **substantial overmatch**]{.underline} [versus
any potential]{.underline} **[great-power rival.]{.underline}** It must
be able to answer the sharpest challenges to the international system,
such as Saddam's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 or jihadist extremism after
9/11. Finally, [because prevailing global **norms** generally reflect
**hard-power realities**, America would need the superiority to assure
that its own **values remained ascendant**. It was impolitic to say that
U.S. strategy and the international order required "**strengths beyond
challenge**," but it was not at all inaccurate.]{.underline}

American primacy, moreover, was eminently affordable. At the height of
the Cold War, the United States spent over 12 percent of GDP on defense.
Since the mid-1990s, the number has usually been between 3 and
4 percent.8 In a historically favorable international environment,
Washington could enjoy primacy---and its geopolitical fruits---on the
cheap.

Yet U.S. strategy also heeded, at least until recently, [the fact that
there was a limit to how cheaply that primacy could be had. The American
military did shrink significantly during the 1990s, but U.S. officials
understood that if Washington cut back too far, its primacy would erode
to a point where it ceased to deliver its geopolitical
benefits]{.underline}. **[Alliances]{.underline}** [would]{.underline}
**[lose credibility]{.underline}**; [the]{.underline} [stability of key
**regions** would be **eroded**]{.underline}; **[rivals would be
emboldened]{.underline}**; **[international crises would go
unaddressed]{.underline}**. American [primacy was thus like a
**reasonably priced insurance policy**]{.underline}. [It required
nontrivial expenditures, but protected against far costlier
outcomes.]{.underline}9 Washington paid its insurance premiums for two
decades after the Cold War. But more [recently American primacy and
strategic solvency have been imperiled.]{.underline}

THE DARKENING HORIZON For most of the post--Cold War era, the
international system was--- by historical standards---remarkably benign.
Dangers existed, and as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,
demonstrated, they could manifest with horrific effect. But for [two
decades after the Soviet collapse, the world was characterized by
**remarkably low levels of great-power competition,** high levels of
**security** in key theaters such as **Europe** and **East Asia**, and
the **comparative weakness** of those "**rogue" actors**---Iran, Iraq,
North Korea, al-Qaeda---who most aggressively challenged American
power.]{.underline} During the 1990s, some observers even spoke of a
"strategic pause," the idea being that the end of the Cold War had
afforded the United States a respite from normal levels of geopolitical
danger and competition. Now, however, **[the strategic horizon is
darkening]{.underline}**, due to four factors.

First, **[great-power military competition is back]{.underline}**. [The
world's two leading authoritarian
powers]{.underline}---**[China]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Russia]{.underline}**---[are seeking **regional
hegemony**]{.underline}, [contesting global norms such as nonaggression
and freedom of navigation, and developing the **military punch** to
underwrite these ambitions]{.underline}. Notwithstanding severe economic
and demographic problems[, Russia has conducted a major military
**modernization** emphasizing **nuclear weapons**, high-end conventional
capabilities, and rapid-deployment and special operations forces--- and
utilized many of these capabilities in conflicts in Ukraine and
Syria]{.underline}.10 [China]{.underline}, meanwhile, [has carried out a
**buildup of historic proportions,**]{.underline} with constant-dollar
defense outlays rising from US\$26 billion in 1995 to US\$226 billion in
2016.11 Ominously, [these expenditures have funded development of
**power-projection** and antiaccess/area denial]{.underline} (**[A2/AD)
tools]{.underline}** [necessary to threaten China's neighbors and
complicate U.S. intervention on their behalf]{.underline}. Washington
has grown accustomed to having a generational military lead; [Russian
and Chinese modernization efforts are now creating a **far more
competitive environment.**]{.underline}

Second, the [**international outlaws** are no longer so
**weak**.]{.underline} **[North Korea's]{.underline}** [conventional
forces have atrophied, but it has amassed a growing **nuclear
arsenal**]{.underline} [and is developing an intercontinental delivery
capability that will soon allow it to threaten not just America's
regional allies but also the **continental United
States**]{.underline}.12 **[Iran]{.underline}** [remains a]{.underline}
**[nuclear threshold state,]{.underline}** one [that continues to
develop ballistic missiles and A2/AD capabilities while employing
**sectarian** and **proxy forces** across the Middle East]{.underline}.
[The Islamic State]{.underline}, for its part, [is headed for defeat,
but has displayed]{.underline} [military capabilities
**unprecedented**]{.underline} [for any **terrorist
group**,]{.underline} [and shown that]{.underline}
**[counterterrorism]{.underline}** [will continue to place **significant
operational demands** on U.S. forces whether in this context or in
others.]{.underline} Rogue actors have long preoccupied American
planners, but [**the rogues are now more capable** than at any time in
decades.]{.underline}

Third, [the]{.underline} **[democratization of technology]{.underline}**
[has allowed more actors to **contest American superiority** in
dangerous ways]{.underline}. The spread of
**[antisatellite]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[cyberwarfare]{.underline}** [capabilities]{.underline}; [the
proliferation of man-portable air defense systems and ballistic
missiles; the increasing availability of key elements of the
precision-strike complex--- these phenomena have had a **military
leveling effect** by giving weaker actors **capabilities** which were
**formerly unique** to technologically advanced states]{.underline}. [As
such technologies]{.underline} "**[proliferate
worldwide]{.underline}**," Air Force Chief of Staff General David
Goldfein commented in 2016, "[the]{.underline}
**[technology]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[capability
gaps]{.underline}** [between America and our adversaries are **closing
dangerously fast**]{.underline}."13 Indeed, as these capabilities
spread, [fourth-generation systems]{.underline} (such as F-15s and
F-16s) [may provide **decreasing utility**]{.underline} [against even
**non-great-power competitors**]{.underline}, [and **far more
fifth-generation capabilities may be needed to perpetuate American
overmatch**]{.underline}.

Finally, [the number of challenges has **multiplied**]{.underline}.
[During the 1990s and early 2000s, Washington faced rogue states and
jihadist extremism---but not intense great-power rivalry]{.underline}.
America faced conflicts in the Middle East---but East Asia and Europe
were comparatively secure. Now, [the old threats still exist---but the
more **permissive conditions** have **vanished**]{.underline}. [The
**U**nited **S**tates confronts **rogue states**, lethal **jihadist
organizations**, and **great-power competition**; there are severe
challenges in all **three Eurasian theaters**. "I don't **recall a
time** when we have been confronted with a **more diverse array of
threats**, whether it's the nation state threats posed by
**Russia**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}** [and
particularly their substantial nuclear capabilities, or non-nation
states of the likes of ISIL, Al Qaida, etc]{.underline}.," Director of
National Intelligence James Clapper commented in 2016. [Trends in the
strategic landscape constituted a veritable "**litany of
doom**]{.underline}."14 The [United States thus faces not just more
significant, but also more numerous, challenges to its **military
dominance** than it has for at least a **quarter century**.]{.underline}

### Dems take Senate Now

#### Non unique - Democrats take the Senate now -- key swing states go Democrat

**Enten 7-5** (Harry Enten, Senior Data Reporter at CNN, Former Senior
Political Writer at FiveThirtyEight, "Here\'s why Democrats could keep
the Senate", CNN, 7/5/22,

[Don\'t write off]{.underline} the [Senate Democrats]{.underline} just
yet Perhaps, the biggest polling shock this past week came from the
state of Georgia. A Quinnipiac University poll found Democratic Sen.
Raphael Warnock with a 10-point lead over Republican Herschel Walker,
54% to 44%. The result was far better for Warnock than the long-term
average for the race (which has either candidate up by a point or two,
depending on how the average is calculated). But even the average
indicates that [Warnock could win, despite Biden\'s approval rating
being well below 40% in the Peach State.]{.underline} The Georgia race
is among [several]{.underline} in 2020 [battleground states]{.underline}
that the national environment suggests **[should be leaning Republicans
but polling on the ground suggests otherwise]{.underline}**. It\'s an
indication that the outcome for Senate control isn\'t close to being
finalized. The 2022 Senate map is rather small. Of the 35 seats up this
cycle, I would categorize less than 10 of them at this point as
competitive \-- i.e., where each side has a better than 10% chance of
winning. A few races could make the difference either way. I base that
assessment off a simple data model that looks at state-level polling,
national indicators (i.e., the generic congressional ballot and the
President\'s approval rating), the past presidential vote, whether the
election was a midterm or not, and expert race ratings (by, say, the
Cook Political Report). All told, the model indicates that the most
likely outcome is for Republicans to pick up a seat or two. That\'s
enough for a majority, as the GOP needs a net gain of just a seat for
control. Considering past errors of the model, it suggests that
Republicans have a roughly 3-in-5 shot at winning back the Senate. The
reason the model is so high on Senate Democrats compared with what you
might expect given the national environment is simple: the state-level
polling in swing states. [Recent public data has looked surprisingly
strong for Democrats in]{.underline} places such as [Arizona, Georgia,
Nevada, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.]{.underline}

[Recent [unfavorable news for Democrats,]{.mark} in the form of [Supreme
Court
rulings](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/21/us/major-supreme-court-cases-2022.html),
and some tragic news nationally might [ordinarily mean trouble]{.mark}
for the party in power[, but that's not what]{.mark} the [results
suggest.]{.mark}]{.underline} The survey began 11 days after the Supreme
Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, when cellphones were still
buzzing with news alerts about the mass shooting in Highland Park, Ill.
In an open-ended question, those who volunteered that issues related to
guns, abortion or the Supreme Court were the most important problem
facing the country represented about one in six registered voters
combined. Those voters preferred Democratic control of Congress, 68
percent to 8 percent. Some of the hot-button social issues thought to
work to the advantage of Republicans at the beginning of the cycle, like
critical race theory, have faded from the spotlight. Only 4 percent of
voters combined said education, crime or immigration was the most
important issue facing the country. [The Times/Siena survey is not the
first to suggest that [the]{.mark} national [political environment has
improved for Democrats since]{.mark} the Supreme Court overturned
[Roe]{.mark}.]{.underline} On average, [[Democrats have gained]{.mark}
about [three points]{.mark} on the generic congressional ballot
[compared](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-dobbs-did-change-the-race-well-need-more-time-to-know-for-sure/)
with surveys taken beforehand.]{.underline} In the wake of the court's
ruling, the poll finds greater public support for legal abortion than
previous Times/Siena surveys. Sixty-five percent of registered voters
said abortion should be mostly or always legal, up from 60 percent of
registered voters in September 2020. The proportion of voters who
opposed the court's decision --- 61 percent --- was similar to the share
who said they supported Roe v. Wade two years ago. [Democrats are
maintaining [the loyalty of]{.underline}]{.mark} [a crucial sliver of
predominantly [liberal and]{.mark} highly [educated voters who

#### Non UQ - Subtle polling trends show Dems are gaining ground after roe, even if republicans are up now trends are in the right direction 

**Panetta 22 \[**Alexander Panetta, Washington correspondent for CBC
news ; "Will Abortion Upend American Politics? Here's what the early
polling tells us" ; DOA 7/14/22 ; Published by CBC news
<https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/abortion-american-politics-early-polls-1.6451553>**\]**

The latest Morning Consult poll, from May 6 to 9, found a sudden
tightening of the so-called enthusiasm gap after months of Republicans
expressing far greater eagerness to vote this year. [It showed that the
percentage of [Democrats describing themselves as]{.mark} \"extremely
[enthusiastic]{.mark}\" about voting this year [jumped eight]{.mark}
percentage [points from two weeks ago**. Younger voters are
key:**]{.mark} They\'re especially supportive of abortion access, and
their level of enthusiasm increased in the latest Morning Consult
poll.]{.underline} Last month, Republicans held a more daunting
advantage, with their voters 12 percentage points more likely to call
themselves extremely enthusiastic, compared with seven points now. [And
[respondents]{.mark} [across different surveys were]{.mark} also more
[likely to describe abortion as a top issue]{.mark} for them in
determining their vote this fall. \"[It could be a leading
indicator]{.mark} of something,\" said Kathy Frankovic, a representative
of the YouGov firm. \"There are some inklings [that things could be
changing]{.mark}]{.underline}. But we really need to wait.\" There are
such inklings in different polls. The Monmouth University Polling
Institute says abortion [has surged to the top tier of
issues](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_051222/)
voters find important, suddenly ranking alongside the economy and ahead
of other topics. The same pollster says
[opinion](https://twitter.com/emmakinery/status/1524407525415739395?s=21&t=qCsHr1fsKEvSH2XyaQJ44A)
of the Supreme Court has plunged. There are other data points telling a
similar, albeit subtle, story. YouGov finds abortion still ranking as
far less important than the economy, but it\'s climbed up the priority
list, particularly for Democrats --- going from the top priority of just
two per cent of Democratic voters to 10 per cent. \"That\'s \[a\] pretty
big shift,\" Frankovic said. That\'s why Easley offers three caveats to
his broader takeaway that the current numbers don\'t look promising for
Democrats. His first caveat is that sudden burst of passion. That\'s a
shift, with the wobbling economy and their party struggling to pass
signature promises through Congress. Of the looming abortion fight,
Easley said: \"It has revved up Democratic intensity a little bit.\" His
second caveat? [[Even a small shift in public opinion could make a
difference]{.mark} in one or two close Senate races, and that could
decide who controls that powerful chamberThen there\'s his third and
final caveat: that nothing has happened yet]{.underline}

### Thumper -- Trump

#### Trump will enter the race -- guarantees Dems win. 

**Drucker 6/19** (David, senior political correspondent for the
Washington Examiner, previously reported for CQ Roll Call and the Los
Angeles Daily News, "Trump 2024 launch before November midterm elections
could become a problem for GOP," Washington Examiner, 6/19/2022,

[Top [Republicans are keeping a **wary eye** on]{.mark} Donald
[Trump]{.mark}, [worried]{.mark} t[he]{.mark} former president [might
announce a **2024 bid before Election Day**]{.mark} this year,
[distracting voters]{.mark} [from]{.mark} President Joe [Biden's]{.mark}
embattled [leadership]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [**galvanizing** Democratic
turnout]{.mark}.]{.underline} With [speculation rising that Trump could
declare for president before the midterm elections]{.underline} to box
out GOP competitors, some Republican strategists and party insiders are
anxious. They fret the move would transform a referendum on Biden poised
to generate a massive Republican electoral wave on Nov. 8 into a more
evenhanded debate between the president, reeling from skyrocketing
inflation and myriad crises, and his polarizing predecessor. [The fear
is not so much that Trump's direct injection into the midterm campaign
turns Biden into a popular president and makes 2022 a Democratic
year.]{.underline} Rather, Republicans are concerned the 45th
president's early candidacy would **[dilute]{.underline}** Republican
messaging focused on Biden and boost moribund Democratic enthusiasm,
shrinking the size of the red wave in a manner that tempers GOP gains in
the House and Senate. "[[Trump being front and center could affect GOP
gains in the House by **five seats**]{.mark} or so]{.underline}," said
Jeff Burton, a Republican strategist in Austin, Texas. "[[But it could
really affect the Senate, which could end up 50/50 again based on how
the seats are looking]{.underline}]{.mark}." "Anything, and I mean
anything, that takes the focus off the miserable job Joe Biden is doing
is bad for Republicans," added Josh Holmes, former chief of staff to
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and co-host of Ruthless, a
podcast popular among conservatives. Earlier this month, NBC News
reported Trump was mulling whether to announce a 2024 bid this summer.
Traditionally, Democrats and Republicans planning to run for president
wait for the midterm elections to conclude before making overt moves to
build their operation, let alone launch a campaign. But the former
president's considerations of an early reveal are based at least in part
on a desire to preserve his advantage over multiple other Republicans
preparing to run. Despite Trump's popularity with grassroots
Republicans, he would face competition in the 2024 primary. Prominent
Republicans who are signaling Trump's entry into the contest would not
preclude them from running include his former running mate, former Vice
President Mike Pence; his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo; and a
political ally, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) --- among others who are
traveling to key early primary states and taking steps to mount White
House bids. For Republican politicians and operatives fixated on the
election at hand, Trump running for president is not necessarily
concerning, versus when he announces. They want a clean shot at Biden
and Democrats in Congress so that they have the best opportunity to run
up the score and win governing majorities. The [[Democrats]{.mark} are
defending a five-seat House majority]{.underline}. [Their [Senate
advantage rests on]{.mark} Vice President Kamala [Harris's]{.mark}
**[tiebreaking vote]{.mark}**.]{.underline} "It would not be in the
president's best interest to launch his campaign that early --- and it
would definitely be a distraction \[in terms of\] the midterm
elections," one House Republican said, requesting anonymity to speak
critically of Trump. [Republicans are hoping the allure of taking credit
for a big Republican victory in the midterm elections will forestall an
early 2024 announcement]{.underline}. "If Trump is smart, he will get
that and declare victory for the largest possible win after it happens,"
said a Republican strategist advising several candidates on the 2022
ballot. "The problem is that all Republican candidates would suddenly
have to answer a new question --- and they'd all prefer to only be
talking about Joe Biden,\" this strategist added. \"We need an election
that's a pure plebiscite on Biden's job approval, an election in which
the conversation is about Biden and Biden alone." With Biden's job
approval ratings cratering at just under 40% and Republicans leading
Democrats on the generic ballot 46.4% to 43%, [[Republicans are
positioned for **significant gains** this fall in Congress]{.mark} and
contests for office at the state and local levels]{.underline}.

### Thumper -- Inflation

#### Inflation thumps -- Foreign policy is nowhere near top issues for voters, even in "Democratic Favorable" agenda

**Fingerhut 7-8** (Hannah Fingerhut, Senior writer at the Associate
Press, editor at PBS, "Inflation, personal expenses rise sharply as
election priorities, poll suggests", PBS, 7/8/22,

-- aagg

[Concerns about inflation and personal finances have surged]{.underline}
while COVID has evaporated as a top issue for Americans, a new poll
shows, marking an upheaval in priorities just months before critical
midterm elections. [Forty percent of U.S. adults specifically name
inflation in an open-ended question as one of up to five priorities for
the government to work on in the next year,]{.underline} according to a
June poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs
Research. That's a [sharp rise from 14 percent in December]{.underline}
and less than 1 percent the year prior. In all, 77 percent mention the
economy in any way, up from 68 percent in December. But just 10 percent
specifically mention jobs or unemployment, as U.S. employers continue to
hire despite high inflation and weak economic growth. Now, too,
Americans increasingly call their personal finances a major issue: 44
percent mention it, up from 24 percent in December and 12 percent the
year before. That includes more mentioning gas or energy prices (33
percent now vs. 10 percent in December) and food costs (9 percent vs.
less than 1 percent). Those [shifts may be advantageous to Republicans
as they campaign to win control of Congress]{.underline} in this year's
midterms; the [economy has increasingly been a sore subject for
President Joe Biden]{.underline}. Still, the economy isn't the only
issue getting more attention this year. [Many also
prioritize]{.underline} issues that are core to Biden and Democrats'
agenda, including [abortion, women's rights and gun policy]{.underline},
which could help Democrats as they try to pad --- or at least protect
--- their razor-thin majority.

Republicans a powerful** talking point just months **ahead of the
midterm election**s.]{.underline} With control of Congress very much in
play, Republicans are investing heavily in a blitz of campaign
advertisements that portray a dark sense of economic disarray as they
seek to make inflation a political albatross for President Biden and
Democrats. According to Kantar's Campaign Media Analysis Group,
candidates running in House, Senate and governor races around the
country have spent nearly \$22 million airing about 130,000 local and
national television ads that mention inflation from early April through
the beginning of July. Inflation was the 10th most common issue
mentioned by Democrats and 11th most common for Republicans, according
to the data, underscoring how critical the issue is to both parties this
election cycle. ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story The data
released Wednesday showing that prices in June climbed 9.1 percent over
the past year gave Republicans fresh ammunition against Mr. Biden and
his party, ammunition that includes faulting Democrats for passing a
\$1.9 trillion stimulus package last year and efforts to push through
additional spending in a sweeping climate and economic package known as
"Build Back Better." [The **intensifying focus on inflation is already
weighing on Mr. Biden's poll number**s]{.underline}. A New York
Times/Siena College poll this week showed his approval at a meager 33
percent, with 20 percent of voters viewing jobs and the economy as the
most important problem facing the country. Inflation and the cost of
living followed closely behind. The poll also showed that the race for
control of Congress is surprisingly tight. While gas prices have fallen
from their \$5 a gallon peak and there are signs that inflation might be
slowing, consumers are unlikely to feel better off anytime soon. Gas
prices are still much higher than they were a year ago, with the average
national price for a gallon at \$4.60 versus \$3.15 in 2021, according
to AAA. Image Voters view jobs and the economy as among the most

Masuike/The New York Times "[It's a very negative thing politically for
the Democrats,]{.underline}" said Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard
University and former Obama administration economic adviser. "My guess
is that [**the negative views about inflation are so deeply baked in
that nothing can change in the next few months to change
them**."]{.underline} The White House, while acknowledging the pain that
inflation is causing, has tried to deflect responsibility, saying that
it is a global problem and attributing it to shortages of food and oil
stemming from Russian President Vladimir V. Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
On Wednesday, Mr. Biden called the latest Consumer Price Index
"out-of-date" given the recent fall in gas prices and said the data "is
a reminder that all major economies are battling this Covid-related
challenge, made worse by Putin's unconscionable aggression." 8 Signs
That the Economy Is Losing Steam Retail sales. The latest report from
the Commerce Department showed that retail sales fell 0.3 percent in
May, and rose less in April than initially believed. Consumer
confidence. In June, the University of Michigan's survey of consumer
sentiment hit its lowest level in its 70-year history, with nearly half
of respondents saying inflation is eroding their standard of living. The
housing market. Demand for real estate has decreased, and construction
of new homes is slowing. These trends could continue as interest rates
rise, and real estate companies, including Compass and Redfin, have laid
off employees in anticipation of a downturn in the housing market.
Start-up funding. Investments in start-ups have declined to their lowest
level since 2019, dropping 23 percent over the last three months, to
\$62.3 billion. The stock market. The S&P 500 had its worst first half
of a year since 1970, and it is down nearly 19 percent since January.
Every sector of the index beyond energy is down from the beginning of
the year. Copper. A commodity seen by analysts as a measure of sentiment
about the global economy --- because of its widespread use in buildings,
cars and other products --- copper is down more than 20 percent since
January, hitting a 17-month low on July 1. Oil. Crude prices are up this
year, in part because of supply constraints resulting from Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, but they have recently started to waver as
investors worry about growth. The bond market. Long-term interest rates
in government bonds have fallen below short-term rates, an unusual
occurrence that traders call a yield-curve inversion. It suggests that
bond investors are expecting an economic slowdown. However, Treasury
Secretary Janet L. Yellen has acknowledged that the pandemic aid package
contributed to inflation by spurring demand in the economy. Last month,
she admitted that she was "wrong" to describe price increases as
"transitory." [**Republicans have latched** **on to that as proof that**

WASHINGTON --- [Republicans are torn between their policy
goals]{.underline} and political ones [in the wake of the Supreme
Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade]{.underline}, [with activists'
rush to capitalize]{.underline} on the ruling [running into the
political reality that abortion rights remain popular]{.underline} in
many of this year\'s midterm battlegrounds. "I don't think this alters
the midterm advantage for Republicans because of Biden's economic woes,"
said former Virginia Republican Rep. Tom Davis. "But [**in a cycle that
is all about turnout, it is a net benefit for Democrats. Angry voters
vote**."]{.underline} For months, all signs have been pointing to a
landslide victory in November for Republicans. But [some in the
GOP]{.underline} now [worry that]{.underline} even [if they retake the
House]{.underline} and make overall gains, **[abortion politics could
cost them a handful of key races]{.underline}** --- and with a 50-50
Senate, every race matters. Democrats call for more action on gun safety

of Americans saying they want Democrats in control of Congress has risen
in polls taken since the decision. "With inflation as high as it is, for
the first time I think it's a jump ball. The Democrats are now back in
it." "If I were a betting man," Madrid added. "I would say Republicans
pick up a majority, but maybe it's not as big as it could or should be."

[The Supreme Court's **decision to overturn Roe v. Wade** catapulted the
issue of abortion rights directly into the midterms campaign on Friday,
with **Democrats seeking to put the issue front and
center**.]{.underline} Democratic candidates up and down the ballot
issued their reactions in a slew of statements following the decision,
while the party's national campaign apparatus rolled out a website
designed to "help voters channel anger into action and organize with
local coordinated field campaigns." [While issues like rising inflation,
crime and the flow of migrants over the U.S. southern border have
dominated campaign rhetoric on the GOP side, **Democrats are hoping to
use the high court's decision to galvanize their own
bases.**]{.underline} "This fall, Roe is on the ballot. The right to
privacy is on the ballot," President Biden said at a press conference
following the decision's release on Friday. Democrats and abortion
rights advocates point to what they say is conservatives' goal to ban
abortion nationwide. "They won't give up unless voters stop them. The
stakes in November's midterm elections are higher than ever for
reproductive health and rights, including abortion," Planned Parenthood
said in a statement on Friday. [In swing states and districts across the
country**, Democratic candidates** rolled out their own statements
hitting **their Republican opponents over the issue**.]{.underline} In
Wisconsin, Senate candidate and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes (D) called for
the filibuster to be abolished so Roe could be "the law of the land."
Fellow Wisconsin Democratic Senate candidate Alex Lasry also called for
the filibuster to be abolished, accusing Republicans of "embracing
extremism." In Pennsylvania, Democratic Senate nominee and Lt. Gov. John
Fetterman (D) drew a clear contrast with his Republican opponent Mehmet
Oz on the issue. "I will protect abortion rights. Dr. Oz will take them
away. It's that simple," Fetterman said. In Texas, which has an abortion
trigger law that will go into effect within the next month, Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke released a video calling for
voters to support his campaign amid news of the ruling. "We have to
focus on the way in which we are going to overcome this," O'Rourke said.
"The only way to do this is to win political power." At the House level,
[Democratic candidates]{.underline} and incumbents also issued reactions
leaning into the issue. Incumbent Rep. Elaine Luria (D-Va.), who is
facing a contentious election bid in the commonwealth's 2nd
Congressional District, condemned the decision along with Gov. Glenn
Youngkin's (R) [announcement that he will seek a 15-week abortion ban
following the decision.]{.underline} "And there it is," Luria tweeted.
"Republicans in Virginia have a plan to remove existing protections for
women to make decisions about their body." In Texas's 15th Congressional
District, Democratic nominee Michelle Vallejo released a statement
calling for Roe v. Wade to be codified into law. ["**We need
representa**tives that will codify Roe V. Wade and **advocate every
single day for our right to choose**]{.underline}," Vallejo. "I will do
everything in my power as the next congresswoman from TX15 to be a
champion for Texas women and families." The issue is also poised to play
a role in competitive state legislature races, like in Michigan,
Arizona, Pennsylvania, Texas, Georgia and North Carolina.
"[**Republican** majorities in these state legislatures are in for a
**rude awakening** **when they start taking away people's
rights**]{.underline}," said Vicky Hausman, co-founder of Forward
Majority, a Democratic group that works elect Democrats to state
legislatures. "We see a great deal of outrage driven by this decision
and that outrage is happening exactly where Democrats need to be winning
in these key districts that present a path to a majority in state
legislatures," she continued. Former Vice President Mike Pence seemed to
confirm those concerns when he called for a nationwide abortion ban on
Friday. "Having been given this second chance for Life, we must not rest
and must not relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center
of American law in every state in the land," Pence said in a tweet.
Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also rolled out
a statement exclaiming "Life wins!" "As this debate now returns to the
states and the American people, we know there is still much work ahead.
Republicans will continue to advocate for life, uphold the law, and
stand against an extreme Democrat Party's pro-abortion agenda," McDaniel
said. However, other [Republicans are signaling they intend to
stay]{.underline} laser-[focused on their messaging regarding inflation,
crime and the border.]{.underline} "Today's Supreme Court ruling returns
the issue of abortion to the states and allows voters to decide whether
they agree with Democrats' extreme support for taxpayer-funded late term
abortion," said Samantha Bullock, spokeswoman for the National
Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. "This ruling does nothing
to change the fact that voters' top concerns are rising prices, soaring
crime, and the disaster at the southern border," she continued.
Pennsylvania Republican gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano downplayed
the ruling, saying in a statement that Democrats want to use the Supreme
Court's decision on Roe to distract voters from issues that matter more
to them. "People in this area and in my part of the state across the
border here are struggling to make ends meet and they don't care about
those issues over there," Mastriano, who's up against Democrat Josh
Shapiro, said. "They want to have security. They want crime to be down.
They want to be able to put food on the table and gas in their cars."
[Democrats say]{.underline} they [are]{.underline} keenly [aware of the
role other issues, like inflation, are playing in campaign discourse,
but argue that abortion access is an economic and health care
issue]{.underline}. "We can walk and chew gum at the same time," said
Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford (D), who also serves as co-chair of
the Democratic Attorneys General association. "This is an important
issue. It is not something that takes second seed to any of the other
issues and nor do other issues take second seed to this."
**Anti-abortio**n organizations are signaling they want to play a
**leading role in the midterms**. On Thursday, the conservative
anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America launched a \$2
million digital ad buy in Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, North
Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin for two weeks. "This is
going to be hugely mobilizing for pro-life Americans, who have now seen
the fruition of their past political engagement, especially the last 10
years when we've focused heavily on Senate races and the White House to
give us this court," said Mallory Carroll, vice president of
communications at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. The Hill's Morning
Report --- Biden leaves Jan. 6 behind with high-stakes Middle East trip
The Memo: Jan. 6 panel looks to build on big Hutchinson moment "We're
talking to pro-life Americans, who don't always vote in non-presidential
election years, and people we've identified as being persuadable, so the
infamous women in the suburbs, Hispanic voters, Black voters \[and\]
traditional Democratic voting groups," she continued. But Democrats and
abortion rights groups are pouring in money as well. In April, the
Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action
Fund announced a \$16 million paid media campaign "to educate and
increase urgency around the abortion access crisis facing the country."
"This is more than a Democratic issue," Ford said. "You have several
folks who are Republicans and Independents who support a right to an
abortion and who I think will be concerned about the fact that the
Supreme Court has now for the first time in our country removed a
constitutional right."

Multiple polls conducted since the Supreme Court\'s ruling overturning
Roe v. Wade find that **[broad majorities of the public
disapprove]{.underline}** and suggest that in the immediate aftermath
[**of the ruling**, the decision could be more motivational for
Democrats than Republicans.]{.underline} In a new [Monmouth University
survey]{.underline} released on Tuesday[, 60% of US adults disapprove of
the Supreme Court\'s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade]{.underline}, with
just 37% approving. There\'s also a significant intensity gap: [53% of
Americans strongly disapprove of the ruling, including 84% of Democrats,
compared with 29% who strongly approve, including 58% of
Republicans.]{.underline} That\'s similar to the finding of two other
polls conducted after the ruling: an [NPR/PBS]{.underline}
NewsHour/Marist [survey (56% of US adults oppose the court\'s decision,
40% support it) and a CBS]{.underline} News/YouGov [survey (59% of US
adults disapprove, 41% approve).]{.underline} In the CBS/YouGov survey,
[52%]{.underline} overall [call the decision a step backward for
America]{.underline}, compared with 31% who see it as a step forward. In
that poll, [51% also say it will make the lives]{.underline} of most
American [women worse]{.underline}, compared with 18% who say it will
make their lives better. [Democrats are more apt to call it a step
backward (77%) than Republicans are to say it\'s a step forward
(64%)]{.underline}, and [while three-quarters of Democrats say it will
make life for American women worse (76%), only 33% of Republicans see
the ruling as making life better for American women.]{.underline} Just
shy of half of US adults, 46%, say it would bother them a lot if
abortion were banned in certain states, according to the Monmouth poll,
with Democrats 60 percentage points more likely than Republicans to say
they would be bothered a lot, 78% vs. 18%. [An 85% majority overall say
that]{.underline} any such [state bans should include exceptions in
cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at
risk]{.underline}; 72% say it would bother them a lot of state abortion
bans did not include such exceptions. It\'s still too early to draw
strong conclusions about what effect the decision might have on the
outcome of the midterm elections. Future polling will show whether the
ruling leads to significant and lasting changes either on which party
voters prefer, or on which side\'s voters are more likely to turn out.
Most Democrats in the CBS/YouGov poll report that the decision left them
feeling upset (78%) and angry (72%), while a somewhat smaller majority
of Republicans describe themselves as happy (60%). Half (50%) of
Democrats said in the CBS/YouGov poll that the decision makes them more
likely to vote in the midterms, compared with just 20% of Republicans
who said the same. While this question does not provide an accurate
gauge of actual shifts in voters\' intention to turn out, it suggests
that Democrats are currently more likely than Republicans to consider
the Supreme Court\'s decision a good reason for voting later this year.

[Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock leads his Republican opponent
Herschel Walker among Georgia\'s independent voters as well as among the
state\'s voters overall in a new poll---suggesting that the incumbent is
**well positioned** to maintain his seat in November\'s
election.]{.underline} In January 2021, Warnock narrowly defeated GOP
Senator Kelly Loeffler in a special runoff election, helping Democrats
flip the Senate blue. As the legislative chamber remains evenly split,
with Vice President Kamala Harris holding the power to cast tie-breaking
votes, Warnock losing his seat in November without Democrats
simultaneously picking up another would shift control of the Senate back
to the Republicans. [New polling carried out by AARP from July 5 to 11
showed Warnock **ahead** with independent voters in Georgia as well as
with the state\'s electorate overall. In the survey, Warnock had the
support of 48 percent of independent voters, compared with 45 percent
who said they\'d back Walker, a former football star who has been
endorsed by former President Donald Trump. That\'s **a 3-point lead**
for the incumbent Democrat among independents in Georgia]{.underline}.

Democrat had the backing of 50 percent of all likely voters, compared
with 47 percent who supported Walker]{.underline}. The poll surveyed
1,197 voters. [A]{.underline} late-June [poll by Quinnipiac University
showed Warnock with a substantially wider lead. In that survey, the
senator received support from 54 percent of registered voters and Walker
garnered the backing of just 44 percent---**a difference of 10
points**]{.underline}. That poll surveyed 1,497 voters and has a margin
of error of plus or minus 2.5 points. The current Real Clear Politics
average of Georgia polls, which takes into account data from January
through late June, shows a close race, however. Warnock narrowly leads
by about 1.6 percent. The senator has the support of about 47.8 percent
of Georgians, and Walker is backed by about 46.2 percent. Warnock won
his seat in 2021 with 51 percent of the vote to Loeffler\'s 49 percent.
Just ahead of that runoff, President Joe Biden became the first
Democratic presidential candidate to win in Georgia since 1992, beating
Trump by less than 12,000 votes. [Democrats aim to maintain their
**momentum** in Georgia in the 2022 midterm election.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, Republicans hope to win back Warnock\'s seat and get back
control of the Senate.

elections]{.underline}.]{.mark} For instance, in the 19 midterms between
1946 and 2018, the president's party gained in the share of the House

four years earlier. But the context of that midterm election was highly
unusual: it was just one year after 9/11 and President George W. Bush
was still extraordinarily popular. [The results of the Virginia and New
Jersey gubernatorial elections last year and the current low approval

Democrats were defending 10 seats in states that Donald Trump won in

in 2020. Meanwhile, [[Republicans are defending two seats (Pennsylvania
and Wisconsin) in states that Biden won in 2020,]{.mark}]{.underline}
compared to just one seat (Nevada won by Hillary Clinton in 2016) that
was up for election in the 2018 cycle. Primary elections with no current

Given how monolithic partisans are in their approval ratings and actual
voting, it is always useful to look only at independents, the 'jump
ball' Americans. Biden's overall rating among them was 35 percent (5
points below his approval among all adults). His best marks were on
dealing with the coronavirus (45 percent approval), followed by foreign
policy (37 percent), Russia (35 percent), and the economy (30 percent).

#### Voters value domestic issues over NATO, no link, and domestic issues deck fo po solvency. 

**Stokols 5/30**/22 (Eli Stokols is a White House reporter based in the
Los Angeles Times' Washington, D.C., bureau. Published 5/30/22,,

NSH

President Biden's five days of meetings in Europe and the bold actions
undertaken by the U.S. and its Group of 7 and NATO allies reflect an
abrupt sea change in the West's approach to its own defense in response
to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The conclusion of a historic summit
here saw members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [ratify a new
strategic
concept](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-29/nato-summit-biden-commits-more-us-forces-europe) that
will maintain a stronger military presence in Eastern Europe and the
formal invitation of Finland and Sweden to join the alliance. That came
on the heels of a G-7 summit in the Bavarian Alps where
leaders [committed billions more to Ukraine's
defense](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-27/implored-by-zelensky-biden-and-g-7-allies-will-increase-ukraine-defense-aid-economic-support) and
agreed to work toward imposing price caps on Russian oil to further
stymie the country's ability to fund its war. "This summit was about
strengthening our alliance, meeting the challenges of the world as it is
today," Biden said Thursday during a news conference, adding that "the
world is changing. And NATO is changing as well. Allies across the board
are stepping up, increasing defense spending." "The United States," he
added, "is rallying the world to stand with Ukraine." But the president,
resolute in defense of global democracy, has been slower to respond to
changes tearing at the democratic fabric of his own country, some say.
His summit meetings were overshadowed by the [Supreme Court ruling
striking down Roe vs.
Wade](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-24/supreme-court-overturns-roe-vs-wade-frees-states-to-outlaw-abortion) and
a blockbuster congressional hearing at which a [former aide to President
Trump
testified](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-28/jan-6-hearing-day-6) about
how Trump's behavior on Jan. 6, 2021, contributed to the violent
insurrection at the Capitol. [[Biden's conviction in Bavaria and Madrid
is not likely to improve his low standing with voters fixated on
pocketbook issues.]{.mark} But it did offer a sharp contrast with what
critics see as his hesitation in seeking to shore up democratic
institutions in the United States.]{.underline} "We talk about democracy
being in crisis in other countries. [Democracy is in crisis in the
United States, and it doesn't always feel like this White House
understands that,"]{.underline} said Amanda Litman, the founder of Run
for Something, a progressive organization that helps young people run
for elected office. [At Biden']{.underline}s NATO [news
conference]{.underline}, his final event before returning to Washington,
[the questions he received focused as much on domestic issues as the
foreign policy moves he and allies made]{.underline} this week. [Asked
about
a [poll](https://apnews.com/article/inflation-russia-ukraine-biden-covid-health-b6d1751b2554555f7246f9e914b87c59) showing
[85% of Americans believ]{.mark}ing [that the country is on the "wrong
track,"]{.mark} he was defiant, attributing their frustrations over
inflation to Russia's war in Ukraine and the Supreme Court.]{.underline}
"America is better positioned to lead the world than it ever has been,"
he said. "The one thing that has been destabilizing is the outrageous
behavior of the Supreme Court." Again urging Americans to channel their
frustrations into voting in November's midterm elections, Biden renewed
his call for Congress to codify abortion protections into federal law,
saying for the first time that he supports an exception to the Senate's
60-vote filibuster rule so that legislation can advance with just 50
votes to preserve women's reproductive rights. "If the filibuster gets
in the way, like on voting rights, it should be provided an exception
for this action," he said. That position could help soften some of the
rising frustration toward Biden on the left in the wake of the court's
Roe decision. But Democrats don't appear to have the 50 votes needed to
change the filibuster requirement and pass federal abortion protections.
Although he [forcefully denounced the
ruling](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-24/watch-live-biden-speaks-on-supreme-courts-roe-vs-wade-decision) as
a "tragic error," his administration has been clearer spelling out what
the president won't do, ruling out a proposal to situate abortion
clinics on federal land and the possibility of adding justices to a
Supreme Court dominated by conservatives, three of whom were appointed
by his predecessor. Many prominent Democrats, including Massachusetts
Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York,
have expressed disappointment that Biden hasn't seemed to share their
outrage or sense of urgency in helping women in peril. Asked Thursday
whether he would call a public health emergency as Warren and others
have called for, Biden demurred, saying only that he plans to meet
Friday at the White House with a group of governors to discuss actions
at the state level. When a reporter questioned whether he was the best
messenger to lead his party's response following the Roe ruling, Biden
offered a somewhat glib response. "I'm the president of the United
States of America," he said with a grin. "That makes me the best
messenger." By comparison, Biden's commitment to defending Ukraine "as
long as it takes" was articulated more forcefully, even as he
acknowledged the effects on American consumers and the global economy.
Asked how long Americans should tolerate paying more for gas as a result
of the war in Ukraine, he was blunt, repeating himself: "As long as it
takes so Russia cannot in fact defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine,"
he said. "This is a critical, critical position for the world."
Republicans, a few of whom attended the summit and met with Biden before
he left Madrid, have largely supported the president's response to
Ukraine. Nevertheless, [[many have]{.mark} also [blamed him for rising
gas prices and the inflation that's been exacerbated by the
war.]{.mark}]{.underline} "There's more of a bipartisan spirit when it
comes to NATO than any of Biden's domestic challenges," said Ash Jain,
an expert on democracies at the Atlantic Council. The juxtaposition
between how Biden carries himself abroad alongside like-minded allies
and at home is evidence that the president faces more constraints and
political challenges within the American political system.
["[It's]{.mark} just [a much harder environment to operate in and the
solutions are much more complicated,]{.mark}" Jain said.]{.underline}
Despite the seriousness of the commitments outlined this week by G-7 and
NATO allies, Biden's political weakness at home --- and that of other
G-7 leaders, who've seen their own support and governing coalitions
wobble in recent weeks --- could work to Russian President Vladimir
Putin's benefit over time, as the autocrat seeks to outlast the West on
the battlefield. NATO allies continue to express concern about America's
political instability. They worry about making commitments to Biden that
might be cast aside should he lose reelection in 2024. "The other
leaders want to know what is he is going to do about a Supreme Court
stripping away people's rights, about these efforts by Trump and others
to attack American institutions," said Brett Bruen, a former National
Security Council official in the Obama administration. "[He has not had
a great plan, and if he doesn't, [the domestic quagmire can become a
major drag on what he's able to accomplish
internationally."]{.mark}]{.underline} Presidents have more latitude to
act in foreign affairs than on domestic matters, where they are more
constrained by Congress and the courts. But Biden's reluctance to
consider structural changes to the Constitution has been a source of
frustration among the base of his party long before the Supreme Court's
Roe decision. "Even if there are some very real structural barriers in
place, we need to see the White House and the president feel the same
rage and fury and frustration that we do," said Litman, the progressive
organizer. "We need to see that he sees the crisis and is unafraid to do
whatever it takes within his power because he's asking us to sacrifice
and organize." With Democrats narrowly controlling the evenly divided
Senate thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris' ability to break a tie
vote, Biden nevertheless has seen much of his legislative agenda
derailed. Until Thursday, he had been reluctant to call on Democratic
leaders to change the filibuster rule requiring 60 votes to advance
legislation --- after briefly doing so in a failed effort to pass voting
rights protections --- to codify the right to an abortion in federal
law. The gusher of new revelations about Trump's role in fomenting the
mob that attacked police officers and stormed the Capitol in a brazen
attempt to halt the Senate's certification of Biden's electoral victory
only adds to the pressure on the administration. Pressure on the Justice
Department to prosecute the former president --- and Biden's potential
2024 challenger --- has grown in recent weeks. Biden's trepidation about
such actions, aides confirm privately, mostly have to do with a sense
that they would be perceived as political opportunism and exacerbate the
country's polarization.But [[with an approval rating of just 39%, Biden
and Democrats are facing a potentially disastrous mid-term election ---
especially if frustrated progressive voters opt not to turn
out.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### AT: Turnout

#### Turnout is a myth -- Democrat base turnout isn't enough for the win

**Teixeira 6-16** (Ruy Teixeira, Senior fellow at the Center for
American Progress, Co-founder at the Liberal Patriot, "Turnout Myths Are
the Democrats\' Drug of Choice", theliberalpatriot, 6/16/22,
<https://theliberalpatriot.substack.com/p/turnout-myths-are-the-democrats-drug>,) -
aagg

There are, however, a number of reasons why this [turnout fix is highly
unlikely]{.underline} to work and, in fact, borders on the
delusional. 1. Some Simple Math. Start with this: [when Democrats
persuade a voter to switch sides]{.underline}, that nets two votes for
the Democrats (one less for the Republicans, one more for the
Democrats). When Democrats turn out one more voter to vote Democratic
that is, of course, a net of only one vote for them. But it's really
worse than that. Typically, Democrats think of increased base turnout in
terms of turning out more voters from various pro-Democratic demographic
groups---young voters, black voters, Hispanic voters, college-educated
whites, whatever. But not all the voters in these groups favor the
Democrats so [mobilization of more voters from a given group may well
net less than one vote per additional voter]{.underline}. For example,
looking at current Congressional ballot preferences, Democrats might net
only a third of a vote for every additional Hispanic or young voter,
six-tenths of a vote from every additional black voter and just a sixth
of a vote from every additional college-educated white voter. The math
looks even more unfavorable when the following is considered: [Democrats
tend to assume that nonvoters from a given demographic are the same
politically as voters from the same group....except they don't
vote.]{.underline} But a mountain of political science evidence shows
that's not so. Nonvoters, controlling for demographics, tend to be less
ideological and, very importantly, if they do vote tend to swing in the
direction of the prevailing political environment---which of course is
currently terrible for the Democrats and likely to be so on election
day. This means the "yield" for the Democrats from higher turnout could
be even less than the data above indicates. Finally, the general
assumption seems to be that an aggressively polarized election will
juice turnout among Democratic-leaning constituencies\....but (somehow)
not on the other side. That's not the way it works. The other side gets
to vote too so dialing it up to 11 on the Democratic positions may
mobilize the other side just as much---maybe more!---than the left's
side. Once again, the basic math on the turnout-driven strategy is much
less favorable than most Democrats assume. 2. The Empirical Record. The
[evidence for turnout patterns driving Democrats' electoral fate is
extremely thin]{.underline} as conclusively demonstrated in The Turnout
Myth: Voting Rates and Partisan Outcomes in American National Elections
by political scientists Daron Shaw and John Petrocik. Recent election
results bear this out. Take the [2020 election]{.underline}. That
election presented a very stark choice to voters. And it was indeed a
high turnout election. The problem: [everyone's turnout went
up]{.underline}, including among groups Democrats would have preferred
stayed home. The net result of higher turnout did not significantly
boost Democratic fortunes; if anything [Republicans may have a
benefitted a bit more from the higher levels of turnout.]{.underline}
This helps explain why Biden's 2020 victory was so much narrower than
anticipated and why the election saw Democrats lose ground in the House
and in state legislatures Closer to the present, look at the Virginia
2021 gubernatorial election. The highly-polarized election, where
Republican Glenn Youngkin beat Democrat Terry McAuliffe in a heavily
blue-trending state, was a very high turnout election. Under the state's
newly liberalized voting laws, the number of votes cast in this
governor's race was 25 percent higher than in any previous race. Turnout
was strong everywhere, including in important Democratic areas like
northern Virginia, black precincts and college towns, but also surged in
redder areas of the state. The real reason why McAuliffe lost was, above
all, vote-switching---in other words, persuasion. According to a
detailed vote history analysis by Civis Analytics, vote-switching from
2020 to 2021 accounted for about 80 percent of the shift away from the
Democrats in the gubernatorial election. Finally, cast your mind back to
the 2018 midterm election where the Democrats did so well. In that
election, the Democrats took back the House (a net 40-seat gain),
carried the House popular vote by almost nine points and flipped seven
Republican-held governorships. Turnout in that election was outstanding,
topping 49 percent --- the highest midterm turnout since 1914 and up 13
points over the previous midterm, in 2014 --- and the demographic
composition of the electorate came remarkably close to that of a
presidential election year. (Typically, midterm voters tend to be much
older and much whiter than those in presidential elections.) This was
due both to fewer presidential "drop-off" voters (people who voted in
2016 but not 2018) and to more midterm "surge" voters (those who voted
in 2018 but not 2016). Nonetheless, the overwhelming majority of the
Democrats' improved performance came not from fresh turnout of
left-of-center voters who typically skip midterms, but rather from
people who cast votes in both elections --- yet switched from Republican
in 2016 to Democratic in 2018. The data firm Catalist, whose numbers on
2018 are the best available, estimates that around 90 percent of the
Democrats' improved performance came from persuasion --- from
vote-switchers --- not turnout. In its analysis, Catalist notes, "If
turnout was the only factor, then Democrats would not have seen nearly
the gains that they ended up seeing ... a big piece of Democratic
victory was due to 2016 Trump voters turning around and voting for
Democrats in 2018." It is hard to avoid the conclusion that higher
turnout is not the Holy Grail for the Democrats, either in this coming
election or in future ones. Instead, it is time for them to recover the
lost art of persuasion. It may be too late in the current cycle for this
to be done or done enough to make a difference. But done it will have to
be if Democrats are serious about creating a durable majority that can
carry their agenda forward. As I have noted previously, [Democrats may
be better off accepting they will take their lumps in 2022]{.underline}
(while attempting to minimize the damage) but use the election as a
teachable moment. That teachable moment should be, above all, about
re-acquainting the party with the actually-existing demographics and
politics of the country they live in. Given patterns of [educational and
geographic polarization, they are now at a crippling disadvantage in
what remains an overwhelmingly working class and non-urban country.
There are simply too many districts and states in the country where
polarization redounds to their disadvantage and makes them
uncompetitive.]{.underline} That is [not a problem]{.underline} that can
be [solved by "mobilizing the base".]{.underline} It calls instead for
expanding your coalition by persuading more working class and non-urban
voters you share their values and priorities.

received a series of warnings from the FBI: Hackers were targeting
states' election websites and, in at least one case, were able to steal
voter registration data. The Department of Homeland Security has since
created an election cybersecurity action campaign, and US intelligence
officials have begun investigating the possibility of a covert Russian

American election. But [despite the growing concerns over foreign

NASS to join Homeland Security's special working group on election
cybersecurity. The group's goal is to build closer ties between the
federal government and local election officials, and also to consider
designating state voting systems as "critical infrastructure," akin to
dams and power grids, granting election offices additional resources and
protections from the federal government. Merrill, along with the
secretaries of state and election officials representing California,

"That's [the voter registration system]{.underline}, which [is not at
all connected to the actual voting]{.underline}," Merrill said, adding
[that in almost every state, voter registration is completed on paper.

On balance, however, [**I do not think that even** the **extraordinary

To choose war, political leaders have to convince themselves they can
either win a quick, cheap, and decisive victory or achieve some limited
objective at low cost. Europe went to war in 1914 with each side
believing it would win a rapid and easy victory, and Nazi Germany
developed the strategy of blitzkrieg in order to subdue its foes as
quickly and cheaply as possible. Iraq attacked Iran in 1980 because
Saddam believed the Islamic Republic was in disarray and would be easy
to defeat, and George W. Bush invaded Iraq in 2003 convinced the war
would be short, successful, and pay for itself. The fact that each of
these leaders miscalculated badly does not alter the main point[: No

important, **[the primary motivation for most wars is the desire for
security, not economic gain]{.underline}**. For this reason, [the odds

they are confident they can reverse the unfavorable trends and establish

observed that "[every war between Great Powers]{.underline} \[between

much]{.underline}, especially in the short term.

#### Economic decline doesn't cause war -- stats prove

[Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary
conflict?]{.underline} Or might downturns encourage austerity and
economizing behavior in foreign policy? [This paper provides new
evidence that economic stress is associated with **conciliatory policies
between strategic rivals.**]{.underline} For states that view each other
as military threats, the biggest step possible toward bilateral
cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking political steps to
manage the competition. [Drawing on data from **109 distinct rival
dyads** since 1950, **67 of which terminated,** the evidence suggests
rivalries were approximately **twice as likely to terminate during
economic downturns**]{.underline} than they were during periods of
economic normalcy. [This is true controlling for **all of the main
alternative explanations for peaceful relations between
foes**]{.underline} (democratic status, nuclear weapons possession,
capability imbalance, common enemies, and international **[systemic
changes),]{.underline}** [as well as **many** **other** possible
**confounding variables**. This]{.underline} research **[questions
existing theories]{.underline}** [claiming]{.underline} that [economic
downturns are associated with **diversionary war**, and instead
argues]{.underline} that in certain circumstances **[peace may result
from economic troubles]{.underline}**.

#### No econ impact

Depression Trigger Another World War?", May 13^th^,

On balance, however, [I do not think that **even the extraordinary
economic conditions we are witnessing today are going to have much
impact on the likelihood of war.**]{.underline} Why? First of all, [if
depressions were a powerful cause of war, **there would be a lot more**
of the latter.]{.underline} To take one example, [**the United States
has suffered 40 or more recessions** since the country was founded, yet
it has fought perhaps 20 interstate wars, most of them **unrelated** to
the state of the economy]{.underline}. To paraphrase the economist Paul
Samuelson's famous quip about the stock market, [if recessions were a
powerful cause of war, **they would have predicted "nine out of the last
five**]{.underline} (or fewer)."

Second, [states do not start wars unless they believe they will **win a
quick and relatively cheap victory**]{.underline}. As John Mearsheimer
showed in his classic book Conventional Deterrence, [national leaders
avoid war when they are convinced it will be long, bloody, costly, and
uncertain. To choose war, political leaders have to convince themselves
they can either win a quick, cheap, and decisive victory or achieve some
limited objective at low cost]{.underline}. Europe went to war in 1914
with each side believing it would win a rapid and easy victory, and Nazi
Germany developed the strategy of blitzkrieg in order to subdue its foes
as quickly and cheaply as possible. Iraq attacked Iran in 1980 because
Saddam believed the Islamic Republic was in disarray and would be easy
to defeat, and George W. Bush invaded Iraq in 2003 convinced the war
would be short, successful, and pay for itself.

The fact that each of these leaders miscalculated badly does not alter
the main point: [**No matter what a country's economic condition might
be**, its leaders will not go to war unless they think they can do so
quickly, cheaply, and with a reasonable probability of
success]{.underline}.

Third, and most important, [the **primary motivation for most wars is

### Gridlock Bad

#### Political gridlock bad\-\-- affects infrastructure

**Fishbane & Tomer '19** (Lara, Adie, Adie Tomer is a Senior Fellow at

SM

Infrastructure talks are heating up again. In just the last week, 2020
presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar pitched a trillion-dollar
infrastructure proposal while the Trump administration and Congress
continue to flirt with major infrastructure packages. This kind of
thinking reflects clear public support for greater investment. While
these concepts and conversations suggest bipartisanship could deliver
infrastructure reform, the current state of national politics delivers
anything but an infrastructure boost. Put bluntly, [when political
discord leads to infrastructure failure, it doesn't just deepen our
distrust of government---it also takes our economy down with
it.]{.underline} After all, it was only months ago when [fights between
House Democrats and the Republican White House spilled over into our
airports.]{.underline} With public employees and contractors forced to
work without pay during the budget shutdown, it was little surprise that
TSA security officers and air traffic controllers started calling in
sick. Then, 35 days after the shutdown began, LaGuardia Airport closed
due to staffing shortages. The budget fight ended just hours later.
[While the budget fight may be over (for now), our political system is
regularly causing less perceptible but more sustained disruptions to our
road, water, and other physical networks]{.underline}. [We can no longer
afford this kind of unnecessary economic harm due to short-sighted
politics.]{.underline} This administration's trade and tariff policies
serve as a potent example of [self-inflicted economic harm]{.underline}.
Since the Trump administration applied tariffs on imported steel and
aluminum, the cost index for steel mill products alone rose by almost 14
percent from March 2018 to January 2019. This directly impacts our state
departments of transportation, their local peers, and water authorities
who all rely on steel and aluminum to construct major capital projects.
As Mark Niquette at Bloomberg reported, states from California to
Michigan to Virginia have already seen certain project costs jump by
millions of dollars. Meanwhile, steel and aluminum manufacturers in the
U.S. have been hit hard by the costs, needing to lay off workers to
close budget gaps. Price increases can act as a fiscal virus, infecting
an agency's entire project pipeline[. Since infrastructure agencies work
on tight budgets and are naturally capital-constrained, there's only so
much construction to go around.]{.underline} So, [when current projects
start costing significantly more, agencies have no choice but to delay
other projects]{.underline}. If the tariffs remain in future years---and
the politically-motivated rhetoric suggests the president will keep
them---[the effects will only compound as more projects are either
delayed or outright scrapped. The net result: lower quality
infrastructure than if the country never instituted the new
tariffs.]{.underline} Oddly enough, while the president pushes a trade
war to boost global competitiveness, our domestic infrastructure will be
less prepared to power our economy once the war is over. [Politics
disrupting our infrastructure stretches far beyond tariff
fights.]{.underline} For example, the U.S. Department of Transportation
has now twice delayed promised capital grants to local transit agencies.
Similarly, Congress and the Federal Aviation Administration cannot agree
on how to manage and comprehensively fund a new satellite-based air
traffic control system. They're all guaranteed ways to raise
infrastructure costs in the long-term and reduce public trust today.
That's why these next two- and four-year periods are so important at the
federal level. For the nearly two years remaining on President's Trump
term, there is a major negotiation coming with congressional Democrats
around our next surface transportation bill, if not a larger
infrastructure package. If the two parties can craft a bill that boosts
investment around long-run needs---from resilience to electrification to
digitalization---and reduce tariff impacts in the process, we'll all be
in a better place. Washington has the chance to give long-run certainty
to our state and local partners, who build all the projects and pay the
majority of costs, anyway. But [if political compromise doesn't
happen---and we have our doubts---the pressure will only be higher on
the next Congress and president to deliver a more collaborative,
bipartisan vision for the country's future]{.underline}. It's why we're
not just watching what happens on the Hill these next couple years, but
why we all should carefully watch the infrastructure and trade platforms
put together by the Democratic candidates for president. Of course,
everyday Americans use infrastructure systems that remind us what
political compromise can deliver. The national highway network is still
one of the world's great capital projects. The commercial air network is
the busiest and safest in the world. We've grown accustomed to clean
water access and are shocked when it fails. [But we have to remember how
easily our politics can upend high-functioning
infrastructure.]{.underline} As the budget fight grounded planes at one
of the busiest airports in our nation's biggest city, stacking up on the
runway, the image said it all. [Unnecessary gridlock eventually drags us
all down.]{.underline}

#### Gridlock is bad -- stops change and solving problems, Congress must cooperate

**Clark '20** (Suzanne P. Clark is an American business executive. She
is currently the president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the
first woman to hold that office, "Gridlock simply isn't an option for
business. We shouldn't accept it from Washington, either" , 10/7/20,
<https://www.dialogueproject.study/perspectives/suzanne-p-clark>) SM

WE MUST ALL STRENGTHEN THE 'GOVERNING CENTER' [[In
business]{.underline}]{.mark}, building consensus is a fact of life. The
[[companies]{.underline}]{.mark}, both [large and small]{.underline},
that [ultimately [succeed]{.mark}]{.underline} are those [propelled [by
a can-do spirit and a relentless drive for
solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}. And the executives who lead them must
bridge divides and rally teams around shared goals every day in order to
boost productivity, support morale, serve customers, and drive growth.
These leaders welcome various viewpoints and vigorous exchanges of ideas
because it's often through the questioning and challenging that
breakthroughs are achieved and innovations are discovered. [[Gridlock is
not an option]{.mark} for business]{.underline}, [[and it shouldn't be
an option for]{.mark} the [elected officials]{.mark} who run our
government]{.underline}. Voters rightly expect results from the men and
women who represent them. And businesses---of all sectors and sizes
whose interests the U.S. Chamber represents---expect our leaders to work
through differences and make smart policy decisions that will allow them
to invest, hire, and grow[. [We need a Washington that
works]{.mark}]{.underline}, driven by men and women who work together[,
[to help rebuild our country]{.underline}]{.mark} [and ensure all its
citizens have equal opportunity [to succeed]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
today's polarized political environment, this is easier said than done.
For many, [compromise is a four-letter word and consensus is a
fantasy]{.underline}. But that does not have to be the case---and given
the sobering slate of challenges before us, it cannot be. We need a
Washington that works, driven by men and women who work together, to
help rebuild our country and ensure all its citizens have equal
opportunity to succeed. [[Challenges of the magnitude we
face]{.mark}---an economic crisis caused by the pandemic and a national
reckoning over systemic inequalities]{.underline}---should compel our
leaders to rise to the moment. They can reject the tribalism that has
fractured not only our political system but also our society. They can
lead with constructive discourse in pursuit of real solutions. That
requires listening to all viewpoints. Negotiating in good faith
acknowledges the skills, knowledge, and perspectives others bring to the
table---including those with whom you disagree. Shutting them out of the
conversation will not build the good will needed to achieve compromise.
[Our leaders also [must focus on achieving an outcome]{.mark}, not
getting credit (or assigning blame)]{.underline}. This is easier when
operating from the assumption that everyone fundamentally shares the
same goals of helping people and solving problems, even if ideas on how
to get there differ. When it comes to serving our country, our leaders
will succeed as a group, or fail as a group---regardless of party
affiliation. Inevitably, there will be issues where the gulf seems too
wide. That is why [we need a strong governing center]{.underline},
populated by lawmakers from both parties who have the courage to reach
across the aisle and build consensus. We know these leaders exist---and
they are crucial to restoring a well-functioning government. In order to
help grow the governing center, the Chamber recently revamped its
congressional scorecard for the first time in 40 years. Now [lawmakers
can earn the Chamber's support not only by voting for the business
position on key bills, but also by demonstrating bipartisanship and
legislative leadership.]{.underline} We were proud to recognize the 59
Democratic and Republican members of Congress who earned the highest
scores by these measures at our first annual Governing with Distinction
Awards earlier this year. We are committed to championing them and
growing their ranks. Such leaders have long been part of our legacy. As
President George W. Bush said in his moving eulogy for Rep. John Lewis,
"John and I had our disagreements, of course. But in the America John
Lewis fought for, and the America I believe in, differences of opinion
are inevitable elements and evidence of democracy in action."
[[Collegiality and cooperation---not just in politics, but across the
public discourse]{.mark}---[will be needed to confront]{.mark} the most
daunting set of challenges in decades: a global [pandemic]{.mark}, a
[devastated economy]{.mark}, and deep-seated [inequality of
opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}. These crises are intertwined, and [if
we don't work together to address them, [they will compound the problems
dividing our country]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[2. Competition]{.underline}** All of the developments in [the global
clean energy transition outlined above mean that sitting on top of
massive petroleum reserves **no longer translates** to **global power**
and **influence** like it used to.]{.underline} Clean energy, in many
ways, is a democratizing development in global energy industries, as
practically anyone with the infrastructure can produce their own energy
relatively cheaply. Of course, while generally true, this is a gross
oversimplification. [Even renewable energy and electric vehicles require
finite resources that certain countries have in spades and which others
do not.]{.underline} [This will likely be a **major geopolitical
factor** in the **energy landscape** of the future\--but it won't be in
the United States' favor.]{.underline} A clean energy resource war could
be brewing between the first and second biggest economies in the world.
[Renewables are currently reliant on lengthy supply chains for finite
**rare earth minerals** and metals including lithium and cobalt, and at
present **China** is **in control** of more than **90 percent** of some
of these **essential resources.**]{.underline} While China has been keen
to become energy independent and energy secure for a long time now,
renewables have emerged as the nation's clearest path to achieving that
goal, as well as to establishing Beijing as one of the major
energy-industry superpowers of the world, if not the outright global
leader. [While the United States will still be able to produce plenty of
its own energy through natural gas and its own clean energy
production]{.underline}, there is no doubt that [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [overall **energy independence** and **exporting
power** will fade right along with the **shale revolution** as other
powers around the globe **expand their own energy production
capacity.**]{.underline}

#### Oil dependence doesn't cause war. 

**Meierding 16**---Assistant Professor at the Naval Postgraduate School
\[Emily, "Dismantling the Oil Wars Myth," *Security Studies*, 25(2):
258-288, Emory Libraries\]

These findings indicate that [[oil wars]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
conventionally conceived, **[[do not exist]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Oil
is an extremely valuable natural resource. However, [**invasion**,
**occupation**, **international**, and **investment costs** reduce the
payoffs of seizing foreign resources]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Profiting]{.mark} from seized oil [is]{.mark} difficult at best and
**[impossible]{.mark}** at worst]{.underline}. As a result, [[petroleum
prizes]{.mark} [are **not**]{.mark} **sufficiently [valuable]{.mark}**
[for oil to be a]{.mark} significant [contributor to]{.mark} leaders'
decisions for international [war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consequently, a
territory's petroleum endowments are a poor predictor of its ability to
inspire interstate conflict. [[These observations have **positive
implications** for]{.mark} contemporary [disputes in]{.mark} oil-rich
regions like [the]{.mark} [S]{.mark}]{.underline}outh
[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea,
[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}ast [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea, [[eastern Med]{.mark}iterranean, [and
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, as they suggest that [[competition]{.mark}
over these territories' oil resources [**will not** lead to]{.mark}
intense militarized [conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, one might
counter this optimistic assessment by arguing that the contemporary
contests are not analogous to the historical cases. The greatest
difference between them is that, in the current disputes, political
authority is ambiguous; multiple countries have legitimate claims to
contested territories. Consequently, in these areas, [an aggressor would
not be seizing "foreign" oil]{.underline}. This distinction would reduce
occupation costs, as local resistance would be more restrained.140
Invasion costs would also be lower, since most of the resources at stake
in these contests are prospective; there is less oil infrastructure for
aggressors and targets to destroy.141 These arguments have some merit.
However, [**[prospective resources]{.mark}** also [generate
**higher**]{.mark} investment [costs, as countries must
**explore**]{.mark} for oil [instead of just producing
it]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The total [payoffs]{.mark} that an aggressor
can accrue from prospective resources [are]{.mark} also **[very
uncertain]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition, [[**international costs**
remain high]{.mark}, as the international community condemns the use of
force in all territorial disagreements, including those where political
authority is ambiguous]{.underline}. Hence, [[the costs]{.mark} of
aggression should still **[deter]{.mark}** contemporary [adversaries
from fighting for oil]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is not to say that
current disputes in purportedly oil-rich regions will never escalate.
However, if they do, it will be for other, more pressing reasons. The
resultant conflicts will not be oil wars

### AT: Readiness

#### Readiness impact cards are lobbying tactics.

**Adams 18** Gordon Adams, professor of international relations at
American University\'s School of International Service and is a
distinguished fellow at the Stimson Center. \[The Military's
\'Readiness\' Scam Worked Again, 2-14-2018,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/02/15/the-militarys-readiness-scam-worked-again/\]

For the next two years, at least, [the American public should be
spared]{.underline} the U.S. [Defense]{.underline} Department['s
**wailing about "readiness."**]{.underline} After seven years of
teeth-gnashing and garment-rending, the [military is]{.underline}
finally [getting]{.underline} what it wants: [more money than
ever]{.underline}. The Donald Trump administration's defense budget
request for fiscal year 2019 is out, less than a week after Congress cut
an overall deal on spending levels for 2018 and 2019. Unlike the
domestic spending part of the administration's budget request, the
defense numbers aren't dead on arrival --- in fact, the military can
count on getting every cent. The [congressional deal set **new levels
for defense**]{.underline}, agreeing to \$700 billion for national
defense in 2018 and \$716 billion in 2019. That's nearly [\$165 billion
more than]{.underline} the military had [anticipated]{.underline} prior
to this year. The United States is back to defense spending, in constant
dollars, that is higher than the peak spending levels under Ronald
Reagan. Only in 2010, at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,
was defense spending higher. It's worth thinking about why defense
spending is about to explode. It's not because of some revolutionary
change in the global security environment --- aside from those pesky
North Koreans and their nukes, America has never been so secure. It's
not because the U.S. military's effectiveness has declined; it remains
the most powerful force in the world, highly capable and very ready. The
reason the Pentagon's budget is now on a long-term upswing is because
[the military has spent years **loudly lobbying** for]{.underline} such
[an increase while complaining about an alleged "readiness crisis."
Complaining works]{.underline}, at least [when the military does it,
because politicians]{.underline} in both parties **[fear the military's
wrath]{.underline}**. Partisan gridlock can still impede efforts to bump
up the military's resources, but now that Republicans are in control of
Congress and the White House, there are no more hurdles standing in the
way. None of this is to suggest, however, that the congressional
generosity will buy Americans more security or a better force than the
one they have today. [Every military leader in history]{.underline} has
[wanted more resources]{.underline} at his or her disposal. U.S.
secretaries of defense have been especially adamant since 2011, when the
Budget Control Act first set limits on both defense and domestic
spending. The tears shed by the Pentagon went beyond complaining about
those pesky budget caps. They also touched on declining military
readiness, units that weren't combat ready, Chinese military expansion,
and just about anything else that defense officials thought might put
the spending train back on the tracks. All [the Pentagon's complaints
**ignored**]{.underline} the **[reality]{.underline}** that [since 2001
the military has been receiving]{.underline} tens, and sometimes even
[hundreds]{.underline}, [of billions]{.underline} of dollars [in
additional funding --- above and beyond the budget caps --- thanks to a
**special slush fund, the O**]{.underline}verseas
**[C]{.underline}**ontingency **[O]{.underline}**peration[s
account]{.underline}. That money is supposed to be designated for
emergencies, but both the Pentagon and the Congress have routinely used
this budget for nonemergency purposes, such as paying, training, and
supporting existing troops (all normally in the Pentagon's base budget)
and buying equipment already in the long-term defense plan.
Nevertheless, the military has complained that its readiness is in
tatters. And after all those years of deployments, military officials
testifying to Congress could always come up with a sad anecdote about
planes being cross-decked to an outgoing carrier, fighters not ready to
fly, or missing pilots. U.S. policymakers have seen this movie many
times before. I experienced it myself in the 1990s, when the brass was
displeased with the budget levels set by the Bill Clinton administration
and whined about readiness problems to the Office of Management and
Budget, where I worked. My follow-up with the Pentagon's civil servants
made it clear that the measures they were using were rigged to show low
levels of readiness; they set standards that called units "ready" only
if they had every capability imaginable to fight a major ground war, and
they counted as "unready" units that were back from deployments and had
missed a training slot for that big war, one they would soon be
scheduled to receive. We knew [the Pentagon was using **manipulated
numbers to bludgeon us**]{.underline} with demands for more funding.
Nevertheless, we caved: In 1994, we added more than \$20 billion to the
defense budget, not really to fix readiness but to try to make the issue
go away before the midterm elections that year. (It didn't work, by the
way.) Four years later, we did it again, busting previous budget
commitments to add billions of dollars more. (For an excellent analysis
of that fight, read This War Really Matters: Inside the Fight for
Defense Dollars by the late George C. Wilson, once the premier Pentagon
correspondent for the Washington Post.) Plus ça change, plus c'est la
même chose --- the more things change, the more they stay the same ---
as military parade leaders in France might say. Today, once again, [the
U.S. military stands on the brink of **an alleged readiness
crisis**]{.underline}, and more money is needed, pronto. **[The trail of
tears became so deep]{.underline}** that it caught up Republicans and
Democrats (always eager to portray themselves as "tough on national
security"). It caught up in the lachrymose flow virtually all of the
think tank preachers at the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage
Foundation, the Center for a New American Security, and large panels of
bipartisan heavyweights reviewing the Pentagon's four-year defense
studies. Everyone in Washington seems to have been swept up in the tide;
even some of the most careful, independent analysts are on board. As
Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and International Studies
noted, "We are stretched too thin.... We are trying to do too much with
the size force that we have all around the world." All [this
hand-wringing is]{.underline} happening [about a ground force
that,]{.underline} after nearly two decades of war, [is **highly
experienced** and **primed**]{.underline} --- and largely back at home;
[a Navy that is larger than any other]{.underline} navy in the world and
the only one with global reach; [an Air Force]{.underline} that is
[**larger** and **more technologically advanced** than any
other]{.underline}, flying, bombing, tanking, airlifting [globally.
**America's is the only military** that has **global basing**,
**logistics**, **communications**, **transportation**, and
**intelligence**; **nobody else**]{.underline}, not the Chinese and
certainly not the Russians, **[comes even close]{.underline}**. But this
is Washington, where the policy and analytical sheep gather under one
tree to be safe from the storm of political criticism. The British
novelist Lawrence Durrell comes to mind: "How nugatory and how glum /
The endomorphs of scholarship / Like hippos on a sinking ship / Stand
bum to silly bum." (Just replace scholarship with politics and the
comparison is apt.) So, on what will the Pentagon spend this largesse?
The last time the Pentagon got this kind of fiscal bump-up --- in
1981-1982 under Reagan --- bureaucrats and military officers were
reaching into desk drawers to dust off plans they never thought would be
funded. As Reagan might have said, "There they go again." There is now a
lot of discussion of funding going into training, equipment maintenance,
and repair personnel. But the big bucks, according to the Pentagon's own
briefing, will go into conventional military equipment. That means more
F-35s and F-18s than planned, a new presidential helicopter, Navy
surveillance planes and destroyers, Marine helicopters, space launch
rockets, tank modifications, another Army multipurpose vehicle, and a
joint tactical vehicle the Army, Marines, and Air Force can all use.
Basically, the services will soon have shiny new hardware. There will
also be a push to modernize the country's nuclear arsenal. This will be
done under the guise of "enhanced deterrence," but really this amounts
to a game of maintaining appearances and "keeping up with the Joneses"
--- or the Russians, Chinese, and North Koreans. The strategic reasons
for this effort are meager; the reality is that [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has **more than enough deterrent force
today**]{.underline} and all the additional nuclear forces in the world
will only undermine deterrence and stimulate even more arms racing. All
this will be combined with accelerated investments in sea- and
ground-based missile defense systems, which have yet to prove
themselves, despite decades of testing and billions of dollars invested.
The [contribution of]{.underline} all this [spending to solve an alleged
"readiness crisis" is not obvious]{.underline}. It's worth heeding what
Defense Secretary James Mattis promised after the deal was signed: "I am
very confident that what the Congress has now done, and the president is
going to allocate to us in the budget, is what we need to bring us back
to a position of primacy." **[An unobtainable primacy]{.underline}**, of
course, [is not the same]{.underline} thing [as readiness]{.underline}.

#### No impact\-\--American power isn't key to global stability.

Conflict and Hegemony by Region Even the most ardent supporters of the
hegemonic-stability explanation do not contend that US influence extends
equally to all corners of the globe. The United States has concentrated
its policing in what George Kennan used to call "strong points," or the
most important parts of the world: Western Europe, the Pacific Rim, and
Persian Gulf.64 By doing so, Washington may well have contributed more
to great power peace than the overall global decline in warfare. If the
former phenomenon contributed to the latter, by essentially providing a
behavioral model for weaker states to emulate, then perhaps this lends
some support to the hegemonic-stability case.65 During the Cold War, the
United States played referee to a few intra-West squabbles, especially
between Greece and Turkey, and provided Hobbesian reassurance to
Germany's nervous neighbors. **[Other]{.underline}**, equally plausible
**[explanations exist for stability]{.underline}** in the first world,
[including]{.underline} the [presence of a common enemy]{.underline},
[democracy]{.underline}, [economic interdependence]{.underline},
[general war aversion, etc]{.underline}. The looming presence of the
leviathan is certainly among these plausible explanations, but only
inside the US sphere of influence. Bipolarity was bad for the nonaligned
world, where Soviet and Western intervention routinely exacerbated local
conflicts. [Unipolarity has]{.underline} generally [been]{.underline}
much [better]{.underline}, [but whether or not this was due to US action
is again **unclear**]{.underline}. Overall [US interest in]{.underline}
the affairs of [the Global South]{.underline} has [dropped
markedly]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War, as has the level of
violence in almost all regions. [There is less US
intervention]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the political and military
affairs of [Latin America]{.underline} compared to any time in the
twentieth century, for instance, [and]{.underline} also [less
conflict]{.underline}. [Warfare in Africa is at an all-time
low]{.underline}, as is relative US interest outside of counterterrorism
and security assistance.66 [Regional peace and stability exist where
there is US active intervention]{.underline}, [as well as where there is
not]{.underline}. **[No direct relationship seems to exist across
regions]{.underline}**. If intervention can be considered a function of
direct and indirect activity, of both political and military action, a
regional picture might look like what is outlined in Table 1. These
assessments of conflict are by necessity relative, because there has not
been a "high" level of conflict in any region outside the Middle East
during the period of the New Peace. Putting aside for the moment that
important caveat, some points become clear. The great powers of the
world are clustered in the upper right quadrant, where US intervention
has been high, but conflict levels low. [US intervention is
**imperfectly correlated** with stability]{.underline}, however. Indeed,
it is conceivable that the relatively [high level of US]{.underline}
interest and [activity]{.underline} has [made]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} security situation in the **[Persian
Gulf]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} broader **[Middle East
worse]{.underline}**. In recent years, substantial [hard power
investments]{.underline} ([Somalia]{.underline},
[Afghanistan]{.underline}, [Iraq]{.underline}), [moderate
intervention]{.underline} ([Libya]{.underline}), [and reliance on
diplomacy]{.underline} ([Syria]{.underline}) [have been **equally
ineffective**]{.underline} in [stabilizing states torn by
conflict]{.underline}. While it is possible that the region is
essentially unpacifiable and no amount of police work would bring peace
to its people, [it remains hard to make the case]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} the [US presence]{.underline} has [improved
matters]{.underline}. In this "strong point," at least, **[US hegemony
has failed to bring peace]{.underline}**. In much of the rest of the
world, the United States has not been especially eager to enforce any
particular rules. Even rather incontrovertible evidence of genocide has
not been enough to inspire action. [Washington's intervention choices
have at best been erratic]{.underline}; Libya and Kosovo brought about
action, but [much more blood flowed uninterrupted]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [Rwanda]{.underline}, [Darfur]{.underline},
[Congo]{.underline}, [Sri Lanka]{.underline}, [and Syria]{.underline}.
[The US record of peacemaking is not exactly a long uninterrupted string
of successes]{.underline}. During the turn-of-the-century conventional
war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, a highlevel US delegation containing
former and future National Security Advisors (Anthony Lake and Susan
Rice) made a half-dozen trips to the region, but was unable to prevent
either the outbreak or recurrence of the conflict. Lake and his team
shuttled back and forth between the capitals with some frequency, and
President Clinton made repeated phone calls to the leaders of the
respective countries, offering to hold peace talks in the United States,
all to no avail.67 The war ended in late 2000 when Ethiopia essentially
won, and it controls the disputed territory to this day. [The Horn of
Africa is hardly the only region where states are free to
fight]{.underline} one another today [without fear of]{.underline}
serious [US involvement]{.underline}. Since they are choosing not to do
so with increasing frequency, [something else is probably affecting
their calculations]{.underline}. Stability exists even in those places
where the potential for intervention by the sheriff is minimal.
Hegemonic stability can only take credit for influencing those decisions
that would have ended in war without the presence, whether physical or
psychological, of the United States. [It seems hard to make the case
that]{.underline} the [relative peace]{.underline} that has [descended
on]{.underline} so many [regions]{.underline} is primarily [due
to]{.underline} the kind of heavy hand of the
[neoconservative]{.underline} [leviathan]{.underline}, or its lighter,
more liberal cousin. **[Something else appears to be at
work]{.underline}**.

### AT: Dems win 2024

#### Midterm results can't be used to predict the 2024 election

[But while a strong Republican performance in 2022 might influence
Biden's thinking on 2024, **it's a mistake to expect the midterm result
to predict how the country will vote in the ensuing presidential
election**]{.underline}. As the chart below shows, [there's **little
relationship between** the margin in the national **popular vote** for
the U.S. House **in a midterm** election **and** the national popular
vote margin **in the next presidential contest**]{.underline}. [So
whatever happens in the House this November, don't expect it to forecast
the results of the next presidential race]{.underline}. [More often than
not, **midterm and presidential results have been miles
apart**]{.underline}. For instance, in 1994, the GOP captured Congress
in the midterm "Republican Revolution" amidst then-President Bill
Clinton's poor approval ratings, winning the House popular vote by about
7 percentage points. But in 1996, Clinton ended up claiming a sleepy
reelection victory by 8.5 points over Bob Dole --- a swing of more than
15 points. In fact, on average, there's been a swing of about 12 points
from the midterm to the subsequent presidential contest. That said,
midterm elections and their following presidential races have sometimes
run close together: Democrats swept back into power in the
[2006]{.underline} midterm election with an 8-point edge in the House
vote, for instance, and then-President Barack Obama won by a similar
7-point margin nationally in 2008. [In fact, midterm and presidential
elections have run closer together in recent years --- but importantly,
there is still not much of a relationship despite this]{.underline}.
Rather, this seems to be happening because landslide presidential wins
are increasingly a thing of the past. [Instead, lopsided midterm results
for the party not in the White House are increasingly becoming the norm,
then followed by highly competitive presidential races.]{.underline}

#### GOP win locks in Trump's victory in 2024---independently wrecks democracy

In the aftermath of the 2020 Presidential election and President Trump's
attempt to subvert its results, there has been an increased focus on the
oft overlooked statewide position of secretary of state[. During his
attempts to subvert the results of the election, President Trump put
pressure on secretaries of state across the country to undermine the
results in their respective states. As the midterm elections draw near,
and with **many Secretary of State positions on the ballot**, the
**former President is endorsing candidates** in key battleground states
**who agree with his claims of fraud in the 2020 Presidential
election**. If they are appointed to office, these candidates could
**undermine the nation's free and fair elections in 2024**.]{.underline}
The secretary of state responsibilities include the management and
oversight over elections within their respective state. While they run
with the affiliation of a political party, the office tends to act in a
bureaucratic sense and does not get involved with partisan conflicts.
The position had very little spotlight until the aftermath of the 2020
presidential election when former President Trump attempted to overturn
the results of the election. This is most evidently seen in his call to
Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, to "find"
about 11,000 ballots needed to flip the results in the state from a
Trump loss to a win. Raffensberger refused President Trump's demand, and
the election in Georgia was certified as a Biden victory, supported by
several recounts that reinforced the same result. [With current
officials across both parties refusing to help President Trump overturn
the election, he has begun to endorse candidates for Secretary of State
who support his claim of fraud. With the 2022 midterm elections
approaching, 27 secretary of state seats are up for election across the
nation. Within these races there are **21 candidates in 18 states who
deny the validity of the last Presidential election's results**. Of
these, Trump has endorsed three candidates for the position in Arizona,
Georgia, and Michigan: three competitive states from the last election
cycle.]{.underline} One such example is Arizona state Representative
Mark Fincher, who attended the January 6 riot and has introduced a bill
to decertify Arizona's 2020 election. Even in Georgia, Raffensperger
faces a primary challenge from U.S Rep Jody Hice, who is seeking the
position to "aggressively pursue voter fraud." [While these candidates
actively sow doubt about the previous election, they are **attempting to
be elected to control the next ones**. If elected, they can use their
office to skew and **manipulate election results in Trump's favor** if
he runs again in 2024. If elected, Secretaries of State who support
baseless claims of election fraud will **weaken U.S democracy** by
undermining the country's free and fair elections.]{.underline}
[President Trump's current attempt to put supporters of his claims of
fraud into secretary of state offices across the country would enable
him to **politicize election institutions, decrease faith in the
stability of elections, and potentially overturn unfavorable
results**.]{.underline} If these hyper-partisan candidates are elected,
it would mark a stark change in the office of secretary of state, making
it a much more political body. [Instead of acting in a nonpartisan
manner, these new secretaries would be able to use the powers of their
office for the benefit of Trump's election attempts]{.underline}. While
there are concerns that these candidates could take action against
election results, they would also diminish faith in America's democracy
and electoral system. A January 2022 poll from Quinnipiac found that 58
percent of Americans believe that the country's democracy is under the
threat of collapse. [Since the Secretary of State leads elections in
each state, if there is not faith in them to properly fulfill their
duties, there is little chance that the public would believe that
elections are free and fair. With a majority of Americans believing that
democracy is under threat, it is **important that the people in charge
of elections are able to instill the public's trust in the electoral
system's ability to uphold democracy**]{.underline}. It would be a hard
task to strengthen democracy while those in charge of elections are
actively supporting notions of fraud. [Furthermore, if Trump runs once
again in 2024, supporting Secretaries of State in key states could
potentially help undermine election results, in the guise of security,
in their states to reverse results in favor of Trump.]{.underline}
Altogether[, these factors demonstrate the threat that these candidates
can potentially have to U.S democracy.]{.underline}

### Impact Turn -- Populism 

#### Republican win lead to populism

The crushing defeat of David Perdue in Tuesday's Republican
gubernatorial primary in Georgia likely delighted Donald Trump's
adversaries, who have been keeping scorecards to measure the performance
of election candidates backed by the former U.S. president. [**Trump has
weighed in on November's midterm elections like no former president,
announcing more than 190 endorsements and holding rallies with his
proteges**.]{.underline} [The success of his endorsees is seen as a key
sign of his continued influence over the party as he hints at another
run for the White House in 2024. But political analysts and Republican
strategists caution that any jubilation among Trump's enemies over
Perdue's loss to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is short-sighted, and that any
scorecard is a poor barometer for the state of **Trumpism in the United
States in 2022.** While Trump's candidates have had mixed success so far
this year in party primaries, **many Republican voters still embrace
Trump's false claims** of voter fraud in the 2020 election, as well as
his right-wing]{.underline}, [**"America First" populist
ideology**.]{.underline} [And failure to win Trump's endorsement has not
stopped some Republican candidates from going hard-right to try to win
over his base.]{.underline} "In 2016, Trump was really the only
candidate running as that sort of populist. Now it's increasingly what
most Republican primary candidates sound like," said Republican
strategist Alex Conant. [That underlines the continuation of the
Trump-led metamorphosis of the Republican Party since he was voted out
of the White House in 2020, even as some party leaders seek to move the
party away from Trumpism, the strategists and analysts said. "I think
the No. 1 thing **Trump has absolutely changed in the party** is that
**Republicans don't even try playing nice anymore.** My side has become
more angry," said Republican strategist Chuck Warren]{.underline}. The
people's 'Make America Great Again' Trump's kingmaker status was put to
the test this month when several high-profile, [Trump-backed candidates
faced Republican primaries in Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and
Georgia. Around two-thirds of high-profile candidates backed by Trump
triumphed in their contests in May, although some were running unopposed
or against weak challengers. One race, the Republican senate contest in
Pennsylvania between television personality Mehmet Oz, who received
Trump's endorsement, and former hedge fund executive David McCormick,
has yet to be decided. In lobbying for the former president's
endorsement, both men **cast aside their elite backgrounds to espouse
the Trump-style populism that now resonates with
Republicans.**]{.underline} The primary was shaken up by Kathy Barnette,
a conservative political commentator, who came from nowhere at the 11th
hour to tighten a race that had until then appeared to be a two-man
contest. [While she finished a distant third in the primaries, analysts
said she was emblematic of how Trump's Make America Great Again movement
has expanded beyond his control. "MAGA does not belong to President
Trump," Barnette said during a Republican debate last month, even as
Trump spoke out against her. "Although he coined the word, **MAGA
actually belongs to the people**."]{.underline} Republican voters in
Pennsylvania also backed Trump-endorsed far-right candidate Doug
Mastriano for governor, who supports abortion bans with no exceptions
and backs Trump's false claims of election fraud. Mastriano won his
contest. In North Carolina[, Republican voters powered Trump-backed
Representative Ted Budd, who voted to overturn Joe Biden's election win,
to victory in the state's Republican Senate nomination. Georgia's
governor's race, where Perdue was pummeled on Tuesday by Kemp, shows how
the Republican Party has shifted to the right, irrespective of how
Trump-endorsed candidates perform in these primaries.]{.underline} While
Kemp did not entertain Trump's conspiracy theories of 2020 election
fraud, he did enact sweeping voting restrictions, limited abortions and
expanded gun rights. But voters were only willing to follow Trump so far
in backing flawed candidates in May's nominating contests. In another
race on Tuesday, for Georgia's secretary of state position, some experts
had forecast neither securing a majority, triggering a run-off. Instead,
incumbent Brad Raffensperger narrowly defeated Trump-endorsed Rep. Jody
Hice, who amplified Trump's baseless claims that he actually won the
Georgia presidential vote in 2020. In North Carolina, voters ousted
scandal-plagued congressman Madison Cawthorn despite Trump's last-minute
plea to give him "a second chance." And in Nebraska, Trump's choice for
governor, Charles Herbster, lost amid accusations that he had sexually
harassed several women. But what is already clear, analysts say, is that
[Trump's winning 2016 strategy to seize on the issues **bitterly
polarizing** Americans is increasingly being emulated by Republican
candidates this year and enthusiastically embraced by party supporters.
**The spread of this right-wing populism**]{.underline} may ultimately
open the door for more challengers to Trump's vice-like grip on the
party ahead of the next presidential election, said Conant, the
Republican strategist.
