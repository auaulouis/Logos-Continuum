### AT Islamophobia 

#### A focus on Islamophobia without recognition of anti-black violence within Arab communities reproduces white supremacy -- a focus on how blackness exists as an antagonism is the key starting point to eliminating Islamophobia

[When discussing anti-Black racism amongst Arab-Americans one often
finds themselves immersed in
reductionism,]{.underline} [apologetics]{.underline} [and ponderous
efforts to incapacitate any discourse at all related to the subject. For
some,]{.underline} [the very idea that anti-Black racism
exists]{.underline} **[not only abroad
but]{.underline}** [within]{.underline} [Arab-American]{.underline} [communities
brings]{.underline} **[with it a wave
of]{.underline}** [humiliation]{.underline} **[which rapidly creeps over
them,]{.underline}** [while for others this subject induces a mixture of
outright denial peppered with unashamed bouts of acrimony. This issue is
one that demands a much more dynamic and vigorous response, and it is
about time we do more than ']{.underline}have a conversation' about a
worrisome subject that continues to generate immense trauma for its
victims.∂ As explained in Dancing on Live Embers: Challenging Racism in
Organizations, by Tina Lopez and Barb Thomas, institutional racism stems
from a network of structures, practices and policies which construct
advantages for white people and oppression, disadvantage and
discrimination for racialized people, this includes specific practices
and laws which enforce segregation in housing, employment and [education
and the policies and procedures work to marginalize and exclude people
of color.∂]{.underline} [Structural racism is the intersection of many
folds of institutional power so as to normalize and legitimize racism.
It allows individuals to practice racism
unchecked.]{.underline} [Arab-Americans**, in relation
to**]{.underline} **[African-Americans,]{.underline}** [have the
advantage of benefiting from white supremacy]{.underline} **[and from
this network of structures]{.underline}** [regardless of whether or not
they are aware of this system]{.underline} [**and of its devastating
consequences**.∂]{.underline} ["Capitalism is utterly incomprehensible
without connecting it to the rise of race, racism, racial violence,
white supremacy, and racial colonialism.\" -]{.underline} Professor
Reiland Rabaka Our communities must recognize that the active
convergence of racism, colonialism and capitalism is necessary to
interpret the historical context of societal inequality because, in the
words of Reiland Rabaka, Professor of African, African American, and
Caribbean Studies in the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University
of Colorado, from his work on Black radical politics, "Capitalism is
utterly incomprehensible without connecting it to the rise of race,
racism, racial violence, white supremacy, and racial colonialism\" (Du
Bois's Dialectics: Black Radical Politics and the Reconstruction of
Critical Social Theory).∂ Psychiatrist, and political radical Frantz
Fanon, whose philosophies continue to impact anti-racist and leftist
movements, born in 1925 on what was then a French colony on the
Caribbean island of Martinique, discusses these crossings in chapter 5
of Black Skin, White Masks (1952) in which he writes of what he calls
the "lived experience of the black"; the discovery of his blackness and
the ever-present whiteness around him. In the aforementioned
chapter, [Fanon continues to grapple with not only his identity as a
black man but the confluence of class, capitalism and colonialism and
their effects on the colonized - from the racialized political-economic
nature of imperialism, including its push for civilizing regions of the
world and the creation of "the other," to branches of capitalism which
deny the very humanity of said "other." "The Negro problem does not
resolve itself into the problem
of]{.underline} **[Negroes]{.underline}** [living among white men but
rather of Negroes exploited**, enslaved, despised**]{.underline} [by a
colonialist**, capitalist**]{.underline} [society that is only
accidentally white," writes Fanon in chapter 6 of Black Skin, White
Masks (The Negro and The Psychopathology); expounding upon the manner in
which racism has been institutionalized so as to not only continue but
rationalize the subjugation of one group by
another.]{.underline} Fanon's fiery response to racism and colonialism
came by way of his masterpiece The Wretched of The Earth (1961) - [where
we find colonialism there is capitalism, and where there is capitalism
there is racism and where these pieces intersect is where we discover
the native robbed of his economic, political and human
rights.∂]{.underline} [With this in mind,]{.underline} [**the
observation of an**ti-Black racism amongst Arab-Americans should be
viewed through a]{.underline} [lense]{.underline} [that reaches far
beyond]{.underline} **[the lowest tier, that of]{.underline}** [social
interactions**; the language employed, including the use of dehumanizing
terms like "abed" (singular) and "abeed"
(plural),**]{.underline} [this]{.underline} [reprehensible branding of
Black persons as slaves, signifies an alarming reinforcement of racist
frameworks]{.underline} [- before we challenge these frameworks we must
first admit that we are complicit in the demoralization and subjugation
of Black persons and communities, and that the extensive exploitation of
these communities is oftentimes denied or outright
justified.∂]{.underline} Dawud Walid, the Executive Director of the
Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-MI),
has been one of many African-Americans bringing attention to [pervasive
anti-Blackness both online and on the ground, demanding that the use of
the word "abeed" end and challenging Arab-Americans to do more than
endlessly call for dialogue. "This issue has been dealt with too
passively for many years," writes Walid. He goes on to note
that]{.underline} [Arab-Americans should take "a more aggressive stands
against anti-Black racism**."∂**]{.underline} [The romanticism
surrounding oppressed peoples is pervasive, especially amongst those
involved in anti-racist work who, while claiming to be allies, engage in
increasingly dominant
savior-esque]{.underline} [fetishism.]{.underline} What comes after
recognizing the existence of racist structures and the identification of
our own complicity is a long but necessary course of action that entails
working against these structures and the tokenization that sometimes
follows social justice organizations and activities. The romanticism
surrounding oppressed peoples is pervasive, especially amongst those
involved in anti-racist work who, while claiming to be allies, engage in
increasingly dominant savior-esque fetishism and thereby turn powerful
opportunities to learn from and engage with marginalized communities
into narcissistic therapy sessions where their voices overwhelm and
muffle the narratives of these groups; those who tokenize these
communities oftentimes come across as well-intentioned but their actions
are no less destructive. [We are not giving a voice to the voiceless, as
the tired adage goes, because their voices surround us - in the words of
Lilla Watson, Australian aboriginal artist, activist and educator: "If
you have come here to help me, you are wasting our time. But if you have
come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work
together."]{.underline}

### PERM -- Islamophobic Security

#### Islam is NOT incompatible with the Western plural State or Western civil society.

Islam should hence not be made the cause of difficulty for Muslims to
co-exist with non-Muslims by demanding from them to segregate or to be
segregated from the latter. [We have heard time and again how
the]{.underline} [early Islamic communities in Mecca and Medina existed
as plural societies]{.underline}, [through the peace agreements signed
between the Prophet and the various pagan Arabs and Jewish tribes then
living in that city.]{.underline} [Islam is inclusive, not
exclusive]{.underline}. One of the important traits for harmonious
living in a plural society is that of being inclusive. Inclusive\', in
this sense, refers to the openness to accept others or what comes from
others, and not rejecting them purely because they are from a group that
appeals to be different from ourselves. Inclusivity is founded on the
belief that positive universal values exist in various groups and
communities. People and their views are to be accepted or rejected
purely based on merit, not on the basis of their origins. There are many
indications that Islam requires Muslims to be inclusive so that they can
help achieve a harmonious and peaceful co-existence in multicultural
societies. [God sent Muhammad as a \"mercy for all
creations\']{.underline} (21:107). [As]{.underline} [this indicates that
Islam]{.underline} [is an inclusive religion, it is]{.underline} [a
tacit call for Muslims to be inclusive in their social
conduct.]{.underline} Islam also commands Muslims to defend those who
are oppressed or persecuted irrespective of their race or religion. The
Qur\'an also states that God will ensure that groups of people who
reject and work to stop evil and aggression will repeatedly emerge until
all the mosques, churches and other places of worship are saved from
destruction (22:40). This indicates that rejecting evil deeds does not
ensure the safety of Muslims only, but of all faiths. This again points
to the idea that Islam is an inclusive religion, which seeks to
safeguard the rights of all members of a society and is in line with
Islam being a religion of mercy for all mankind. [Islam also encourages
Muslims to have an open
attitude]{.underline} [to]{.underline} positive [ideas from foreign
sources]{.underline}, to learn from the experiences of others, and to
strive toward what is good. These are important prerequisites in
promoting progress and development. [Knowledge is regarded as something
that should be sought after regardless of its source of
origin]{.underline}. The Prophet has once said that \"wisdom is the lost
property of the believers. Whoever finds it is entitled to it.\" Early
Muslim scholars encouraged Muslims to seek knowledge in every part of
the known world, \"even from as far away as China\', because that nation
was then a thriving civilisation from which Muslims could derive much
knowledge. Western scholars have also acknowledged that Muslims were
responsible for preserving and subsequently transmitting to the West
much of the intellectual heritase of the Ancient Greek and Roman
civilisations. This would not have been possible had the Muslims then
not embraced inclusivity. Like other religions, Islam requires its
followers to preserve its principles and fundamentals. Some of these
distinguish Islam from the other faiths and provide Muslims with a
distinct identity. Nevertheless, [Islam does not call
for]{.underline} such [absolute forms of exclusivity which would detach
or separate Muslims from other communities, causing them to reject
anything that comes from \"the Other\',]{.underline} just because this
\"Other\' happens to confess another faith. [Such
a]{.underline} positive [attitude would not have been possible if the
teachings of Islam were fundamentally incompatible with a plural
society.]{.underline}
