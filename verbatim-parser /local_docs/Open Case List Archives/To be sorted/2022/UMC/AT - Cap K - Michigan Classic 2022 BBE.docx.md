In an astonishing [[speech]{.mark} delivered]{.underline} in London
[on]{.underline} [April 27]{.underline}, [British foreign secretary [Liz
Truss](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-mansion-house-speech-at-the-lord-mayors-easter-banquet-the-return-of-geopolitics) [called
for the "globalisation" of]{.mark}]{.underline} the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ([**[NATO]{.underline}**) [to **pre-empt "threats**
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the Indo-Pacific", namely
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}. Truss's speech, entitled "The return of
geopolitics" promoted a stronger NATO in response to the war in Ukraine,
but reserved much of its venom for China.

It is almost a year since Britain sent its new aircraft carrier,
the [HMS Queen Elizabeth](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3143308/british-navy-shows-global-ambitions-aircraft-carriers-south#:~:text=HMS%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20and%20its%20strike%20group%20are%20in%20the,the%20end%20of%20the%20year.) for
military drills in the South China Sea --- the first such mission since
the beginning of the Korean War. Truss visited Australia in January to
further sound the drums of war, with totally unfounded denunciations of
China's intentions in the region.

Britain's [previous [imperial exchanges with China]{.mark} include
[running opium]{.mark} into the country, launching the opium
wars, [and]{.mark} the [seizure of Hong Kong]{.mark}.]{.underline} Given
this history, Truss's most recent outburst [[hardly
endeared]{.underline}]{.mark} her [[to the Chinese]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Truss said the globalisation of NATO is a necessary step. [China, the
South China Sea, and the entire region is,]{.underline} according to her
logic[, within the sphere of influence and responsibility of
NATO]{.underline}.

But the [concept of globalising NATO is absurd]{.underline}. NATO is
constituted as a regional military alliance concerned with the North
Atlantic. Thus, [[China does not]{.mark} easily [fit into NATO's]{.mark}
purported [mission]{.mark} to [protect Europe]{.mark} [from security
threats]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The **[[hypocrisy]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the Foreign Secretary when
it comes to relations with China is unacceptable. Truss envisions "[a
world where free nations are **assertive** and in the ascendant.
[Where]{.mark} freedom and [democracy]{.mark} are [strengthened
through]{.mark} a network of [economic]{.mark} and security
[partnerships]{.mark}. Where **aggressors are contained** [and]{.mark}
forced to take a better path".]{.underline} These few lines outline an
entire world view that **[threatens us all]{.underline}**.

First, there is the appeal for free nations to become increasingly
"assertive". Freedom, in this logic comes at the point of a bayonet.
**[[China]{.mark} has been [routinely criticised]{.mark} over the past
decade [for being too assertive]{.mark}. But China's
\"[assertiveness]{.mark}\" has [often been]{.mark} in [response to
aggressive actions]{.mark} [by]{.mark} successive [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates administrations,]{.underline}** with the loyal support
of Australia**[.]{.underline}**

Truss claims that economic and security agreements strengthen democracy
and freedom. China and [the Solomon
Islands](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/solomon-islands-elections-and-preparing-war) have
just entered into a security agreement which might well include economic
benefits, but this is being used as proof of China's aggressive intent.

[China's economic rise is a fact]{.underline}. It is something that the
US is fighting, and the British ruling class seems to think it a fight
that can be won. Truss argues that "by talking about the rise of China
as inevitable we are doing China's work for it. In fact, their rise
isn't inevitable. They will not continue to rise if they don't play by
the rules\". Some might see that as a direct threat.

The British anti-China campaign insists China observes certain rules.
But these imperialist rules have nothing to do with observing democratic
values. Instead, [imperialism demands that China must not seek economic
power, and must not influence others.]{.underline} Such
imperialism [cannot be simply
dismissed](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/24/former-australian-pm-paul-keating-criticises-liz-truss-over-demented-china-comments):
the actions of Britain are part of a broader movement that is gaining
momentum and is becoming more strident.

Britain's [overt militarism]{.underline} in the region [is often
portrayed as a response to Chinese assertiveness and [imagined
aggression]{.mark}. But behind this [an **overarching agenda**]{.mark}
**of struggle [for control of]{.mark} the [world
economy]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The influential [Australian Strategic Policy
Institute](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/australia-should-make-its-own-long-range-missiles/) is
urging that Australia should begin to produce long-range missiles. The
only possible target for such missiles would be China.

Australia, Britain and the US have pledged to expand their cooperation
in the development and deployment of [hypersonic
weapons](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/05/aukus-pact-extended-to-development-of-hypersonic-weapons) as
part of the AUKUS security arrangement.

China has responded to this heightened threat by decrying what it
describes as an "[Asia-Pacific version of
NATO](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/post/max-opray/2022/04/07/china-rages-against-asia-pacific-nato)".
China's concerns are understandable and such provocative actions serve
to [make the region more insecure.]{.underline} These actions, along
with the calls for a [[globalised NATO]{.mark} will only [**generate**
**more fear and distrust**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

This is a [dangerous state of play]{.underline}. Threats are inevitably
met by counter threats. Arms build-ups are met with arms build-ups. War
preparations continue, and billions upon billions of dollars are spent
on preparing for a war that is in no-one's best interests. There will be
huge ramifications for working people everywhere.

The [[**[global economy is fragile]{.mark}** and growth is
slowing]{.underline}](https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2022/05/03/its-not-looking-good-for-2022/).
In the first quarter of 2022 the [US economy shrunk by 0.4%, Germany's
rose by just 0.2% and China's by 1.3%.]{.underline} Other economies have
yet to release data, but the **[trend is clear]{.underline}**. The
International Monetary Fund forecasts total global growth for the next
two years to be in the range of 2%. While all economies are slowing,
[[China's remains relatively healthy]{.mark} with annual growth
predictions of about 5%]{.underline}.

If China does not play by the \"rules\" as determined by the US, Britain
and Australia, then its economic growth must be curtailed, or so runs
the imperialist narrative. If this is the case then the
[[capitalist]{.mark} global [economy]{.mark} is **[set for
contraction]{.mark}, recession and depression**]{.underline}, as it is
largely due to the continued relative health of the Chinese economy that
global capitalism is still keeping its head above water. These
realities, it would seem, are secondary to the desire to stop China's
economic growth.

There is madness in this approach. [The [upholders]{.mark} of the
rules-based order are [prepared to]{.mark} fight tooth and claw to
[preserve capitalism]{.mark}, not democracy]{.underline}. They are
prepared to do anything to [maintain US domination]{.underline}. A
confrontation with China is a fight against a capitalist rival. [[China
does not threaten capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it does pose a
real risk that US economic power will be lost.

The world has never been more insecure. **[Global capitalist growth is
crumbling]{.underline}**. The climate crisis is an existential threat.
War rages in Europe, [and the **[US]{.mark}** and its allies are
**[turning]{.mark}** their **[attention to]{.mark}** a potentially
**[devastating conflict]{.mark} with China**.]{.underline}

Truss is but the latest of a long line of warmongers who threaten the
peace and stability of us all. She is not alone. She speaks on behalf of
the nations of AUKUS --- a cog in the wheel of a globalising NATO.

### AFF AT -- AI

#### AI good for communism \-\-- No Link

**Feng** Xiang **18**, professor at Tsinghua University, one of China's
most prominent legal scholars, spoke at the Berggruen Institute's China
Center workshop on artificial intelligence in March in Beijing,

[[The dream of **communism** is the **elimination of wage labor**. If
**AI** is]{.mark} bound [to **serve society** instead of]{.mark} private
[capitalists,]{.mark} it promises to do so by freeing]{.underline} an
overwhelming majority from such drudgery [[while **creating wealth to
sustain all.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[If the state controls the market, instead of digital capitalism
controlling the state]{.mark}, true [**communist aspirations** will be
**achievable**]{.mark}. And [because **AI** increasingly **enables** the
**management of complex** systems by processing massive amounts of
information through intensive feedback loops,]{.mark} it
presents]{.underline}, for the first time[, [a **real
alt**]{.underline}]{.mark}[ernative [**to** the market signals that have
long justified **laissez-faire ideology**]{.mark}]{.underline}---and all
the ills that go with it.

Going forward, China's socialist market economy, which aims to harness
the fruits of production for the whole population and not just a sliver
of elites operating in their own self-centered interests, can lead the
way toward this new stage of human development.

[[If properly regulated]{.mark} in this way, [we should **celebrate, not
fear**,]{.mark} the advent of **[AI]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If it is
brought under social control, [[it will finally free workers from
peddling their time and sweat only to enrich those at the top.]{.mark}
The communism of the future ought to adopt a new slogan: "Robots of the
world, unite!"]{.underline}

#### AI will be the end of Capitalism

It is the very pervasiveness of [**[AI]{.mark}** that [will spell the
**end of market dominance**]{.mark}. The market may reasonably if
unequally function if industry creates employment opportunities for most
people. But [when **industry** ]{.mark}**only [produce]{.mark}s
[joblessness,]{.mark}** [as **robots take over** ]{.mark}more and more,
[there is no good alternative but **for the state to step
in**]{.mark}.]{.underline} As AI invades economic and social life, all
private lawrelated issues will soon become public ones. [More and more,
[**regulation of private companies** will become a **necessity** to
maintain some semblance of stability in societies roiled by constant
innovation.]{.mark}]{.underline}
