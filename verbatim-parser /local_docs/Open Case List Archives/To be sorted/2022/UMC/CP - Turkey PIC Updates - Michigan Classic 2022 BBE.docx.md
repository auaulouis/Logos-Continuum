In a rapidly shifting global environment, [[China and Turkey
have]{.mark} found [many common points of interest]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Despite the immense geographical [a]{.mark}nd cultural distance between
them, the [[bilateral relationship has emerged as a priority for both
parties]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the modern era, as [[China seeks to
expand its trade rela-tions]{.mark} [and]{.mark} other mechanisms of
soft power throughout the world, [improving]{.mark} [relations with
Turkey presents opportunities that cannot be
ignored]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Turkey's geostrategic placement,
regional influence]{.mark}, and relatively strong economy by regional
standards [attract Chinese attention]{.mark}]{.underline}. Conversely,
[[from the Turkish perspective]{.mark}, after years of strained
relations with the EU and nato, [China represents a fresh partner
willing to cooperate without overbearing political
demands]{.mark}]{.underline}. The multifaceted and complicated nature of
the relationship makes it difficult to briefly characterise.
[Since]{.mark} October [2010]{.mark} [the two]{.mark} partners have
[defined their bilateral ties as a 'strategic cooperative
relationship]{.mark}' ('China, Turkey to establish strategic cooperative
relationship', 2010), but despite the fact that [[cooperation between
the two does exist]{.underline}]{.mark} (though it is questionable as to
whether it rises to the 'strategic' level), there remains contentious
problems where national interests on both sides collide.In this
relationship, the two sides are not equals. Contemporary China is a
global juggernaut on the economic front and holds a permanent seat on
the UN Security Council, whereas Turkey can make no such boasts in
either field. Turkey is incapable of affecting the 'rise' of China.
Whether or not Turkey desires a more assertive and powerful China is
immaterial to reality on the ground. Therefore, from a purely pragmatic
perspective, instead of resisting the changing tides of global power
alongside its historic Western partners, Turkey is attempting to take
advantage of the situation to capture a portion of China's growth for
itself wherever possible.Seeking to revive its position as a regional
power, improving relations with China renews its historical image as a
bridge between East and West. During the latter part of his tenure as
foreign minister, Davutoğlu expressed an ambition to 'develop a
democracy with European Union standards, and a production style with
Chinese standards' (Bacık, 2011). Thus, within the vein of the 'China
Model' or 'Beijing Consensus', [[Turkey views China not only as a
partner, but as an example to be emulated in order to improve upon its
own relative economic position]{.underline}]{.mark}. Beyond material
interests, the 'rise of China' presents an ideational pull factor for
Turkish attention. Particularly after the Eurozone crisis, the European
development model and EU membership in general, has become far less
attractive than close relations with China, to say nothing of the
traumatic experience Turkey underwent in its own bid to join the EU.On
the popular level, however, Turks generally maintain negative
percep-tions of China, and a general improvement in bilateral relations
will necessi-tate overcoming this gap. In a 2017 Pew poll, 54 per cent
of Turks expressed an unfavourable view of China, a measure of
disapproval that has not descended below 50 per cent since 2006 (Global
Indicators Database, 2019). Relations are first and foremost driven by
elites, and people- to- people ties remain lacklustre. Since the
founding of the modern Turkish Republic in 1923, Turkey has primar-ily
looked to the West as a cultural model to emulate. As a member of nato,
Turkey has historically remained firmly in the Western camp regarding
global geopolitics as well; Turkey and China militarily confronted each
other directly once in the context of the Korean War. The development of
Sino--Turkish rela-tions followed a similar timeline to that of the
Sino-- US thaw, with the opening of a Turkish embassy in Beijing in
1971. [With]{.mark} the general [[decline of the US-- Turkish
partnership]{.mark} after disagreements surrounding the 2003 Iraq
invasion, improving [**cooperation with China is a**]{.mark} potential
[**asset for Turkey to diversify its foreign relations**]{.mark} so that
it is no longer completely dependent upon its tra-ditional Western
alliances]{.underline}. This is a part of [[Turkey's]{.mark} new
multi-dimensional and [multi- track foreign policy]{.mark}, which
[intends to expand Turkey's role in the world to that of a major
regional player]{.mark} without subscribing to a zero-sum mentality in
foreign policy]{.underline}. [This [foreign policy style is also
apparent vis]{.underline}]{.mark}[- à- vis [Russia]{.mark}, where
**[Turkey has sought out diplomatic cooperation despite Western
resistance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Despite this effort to create an
atmosphere of competition among different power blocs, Turkey's alliance
with the United States remains of paramount importance in its overall
foreign policy outlook. It is unlikely that Turkey would prioritise its
relationship with China over the interests of the United States
regarding issues of dire importance.

### Aff AT Russia

#### Turkey can balance their relationships with NATO and Russia

hedging strategy between the West and Russia\", Department of Political

In the face of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, [[Turkey]{.mark}
takes a cautious position in line with [i]{.mark}t[s]{.mark} [hedging
strategy between the West and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with the aim
[to maintain positive relations with both sides]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Turkey has armed Ukraine and condemned Russia's
aggression]{.underline}. [But it does not join Western sanctions against
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Due to traumatic historical experiences,
[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark} does not want to be caught up in a
conflict between major powers/blocs [and [prefers to retain its
strategic autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Recent crises of confidence
between Turkey and the West reinforce this stance. Due to its
geographical location and bad economic situation, Turkey has a direct
interest in a rapid end to the war. This explains its active mediation
role, where theoretically a more passive stance was possible. In
addition, this high-profile mediation might also enhance Turkey's
international standing and help stem the decline of popularity of the
incumbent leadership domestically.
