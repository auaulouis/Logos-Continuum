#### Russia's invasion on Ukraine demonstrates the transition away from US hegemony---no longer unipolar

Fifth, there is [political risk and uncertainty. Russia's Ukraine
invasion has up-ended many key western assumptions about the post -Cold
War order. Indeed, the invasion symbolizes the shift in global power and
a move away from the unipolar world that followed the collapse of the
Soviet Union. U.S. hegemony has withered, and we are in a multi-polar
rather than unipolar world, which is more dangerous]{.underline}
(Mearsheimer, 2019). Uncertainty may drive up savings ratios and make
firms more reluctant to invest. On the other hand[, the crisis is
another potential challenge to globalization, coming after trade
disputes and Covid, and so manufacturers may be tempted to re-onshore
some facilities]{.underline}. With the freezing of Russian central bank
assets, its banks' access to SWIFT being restricted, and Germany and the
EU being willing to supply arms to Ukraine, risks in Russia are clearly
more profound than elsewhere in Europe, with the rouble plunging on
foreign exchanges (we expect it to continue its descent) and the central
bank hiking interest rates to 20 per cent to contain inflationary
pressure. Russian bank subsidiaries abroad have seen share prices fall
precipitously and there have been queues at cash machines in Russia on
worries of bank liquidity problems.

#### US Hegemony Failing Now -- Ukraine and Middle East Prove

[The [U.S.'s desire to assert]{.mark} their [hegemony]{.mark} so
aggressively [in the Middle East may be a result of]{.mark} the [fears
that if it does not display its military]{.mark} power, [other states
will cease to feel threatened by it]{.mark}]{.underline}. The end of the
Cold War saw the death of the bipolar international system that had been
in place for decades and as of yet, a new structure that appears to be
taking the shape of multiple strong powers is yet to be born (Bauman,
2001). [[The Soviet Union collapsed after the Cold War yet the U.S. has
also been in decline since the conflict]{.mark} ended. [During this
period]{.mark}, a variety of what Gramsci calls morbid symptoms, in the
form of [terrorist organizations, have risen]{.mark} (Cohen, 2013).
However, [the U.S. has been reluctant to relinquish unipolar dominance
and benefits it brings, leading to attempts to assert it as far]{.mark}
and wide [as possible]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The hegemony]{.mark} that the [U.S. has asserted]{.mark} so
aggressively [in the Middle East looks to be in
decline]{.mark}]{.underline}, however[, [with Russia and China the
biggest challengers to its global power]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Russia
has maintained resentment towards the U.S. since the end of the Cold War
and did not agree with it taking on the role of world
authority]{.underline} (Graham, 2019). In the 1990s it did not have the
power to challenge this but has slowly been resurging and has sustained
a good relationship with President Assad[. [Successful Russian
opposition to the U.S. in Syria]{.mark}, through the use of asymmetrical
warfare and veto powers, [has shown weaknesses in U.S. military
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, [[the lack of physical force
from the U.S. in Syria is perceived as a decline in U.S.
hegemony]{.mark}, partly because it was so aggressively involved in many
Middle Eastern crises leading up to this.]{.underline}

[[Russia has also opposed the U.S. in Ukraine and]{.mark} the
[Obama]{.mark} administration [did little to deal with]{.mark} Russian
[annexation of Crimea]{.mark}, even though its support for Ukraine was
made official in the Budapest Memorandum. [Hyper-involvement in the
Middle East has drained U.S. military resources and weakened public
support for]{.mark} heavy-handed [military intervention, which has
strengthened the Russian influence of power]{.mark} in both Eastern
Europe and the Middle East]{.underline}.

[[U.S. hegemony in the Middle East and further afield may be in decline
and its policies perhaps need rethinking]{.mark}, however emerging
powers are reluctant to attempt world governance.]{.underline}
Conceivably they are wary after seeing the U.S.'s failings in the region
and are more cautious of making the same mistakes on the international
stage.

#### Increasing Chinese development on emerging technologies leads to US hegemonic decline

A third cause of great-power decline concerns the diffusion of
technology. [Late modernizers, such as Japan after 1864 and again in the
1960s and '70s as well as China after 1978 can move quite quickly up the
technology curve as once cutting-edge ideas and scientific breakthroughs
become widely shared.]{.underline} In the post-World War II era, the
Soviets quickly matched U.S. achievements in nuclear weapons, aircraft,
missiles, and electronics, and in more recent decades, China and others
have adopted advances in high-speed computing, precision weapons, and
advanced technology of all kinds. [While many of China's recent advances
have been accelerated by intellectual piracy and via technology transfer
extorted from foreign firms wanting to invest in China, Beijing's
massive investments in science and technology have also become a factor
in both military and civilian fields, and its total spending on
scientific research in 2018 is for the first time estimated to equal or
possibly exceed that of the United State]{.underline}s (Guarino,
Rauhala, and Wan 2018). For example, China and Russia are ambitiously
pursuing research and development of advanced weapons such as hypersonic
missiles, a technology in which the United States is thought to be
lagging (Davenport 2018). A lesser example comes from the military use
of drone technology. Once the near monopoly of the United States and
Israel, this has now spread so widely that Iran and even a terrorist
group such as Hezbollah have acquired the capacity to produce and deploy
these weapons. [The importance of technology diffusion in undercutting
America's advantages can be seen in contrast to what Barry Posen
previously termed "command of the commons" (2003).5 Posen's 2003
assessment, published at the height of America's post-Cold War power,
identified unique U.S. military advantages in the air, space, at sea,
and under the sea.]{.underline} The implication was that with such an
overwhelming advantage at that time, the United States could readily
afford to reduce its overseas deployments, as its strategic predominance
remained assured. [Technological diffusion in the civilian sphere is
also pronounced and has been increasing over the past half
century.]{.underline} Massive expansion of trade, globalization, the
role of multinational corporations, and the rapid spread of scientific
and technological knowledge have all played a role. Here, too, there is
evidence of how hegemonic power can be self-reversing.

#### US Hegemony Declining -- China and BRICS Confirm

of America\'s hegemonic decline and the configuration of new power

The [contemporary time is characterized by the rise of China in the
international system]{.underline}. Based on Waldron (2005), The Asian
[tiger (China)\'s military and economic advancement are transforming the
entire structure of the international politics and
economics.]{.underline} As such, [its vast economic expansion and rapid
infrastructural establishments are both provenance of Western
and]{.underline} [Japanese]{.mark} [concerns]{.underline}. Thus, this is
mainly led by the Chinese quest for natural resources and mineral
resources and also their policy of no strings attached positioning on
their financial aid (Brautigam & Xiaoyang, 2012[). The Pentagon had also
recognized China as the only country in the world to be able to
challenge the US hegemony in the international system]{.underline} (Chen
& Feffer, 2009, p. 48). The ensuing reasons behind these are: in 2015,
China introduced the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to counter the
US engagement in monopolizing the global lending system through the
World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) (Elsinga,
2015; Shangai, 2014). [China had also demonstrated its interest in
overtaking and exercising dominion over global connections by erecting
the "New Silk Road" which runs between Western Europe and Asia with
maritime and continental routes]{.underline} (Monteleone, 2018). [These
maritime routes are used by China to explore the world to significant
markets like Greece\'s Piraeus and Gwadar\'s Pakistan and they are also
used for the organization- facilitation between the peripheries and the
core world]{.underline} (Komlosy, 2016). In spite of the attempts to
establish and sustain "Eurasian Economic Union" by 4 of 7 RAPANYANE
[Russia, this will still be beneficial to China as Russia has welcomed
with both hands, Chinese investment and loans in mining, pipelines as
well as transport infrastructure]{.underline} (Kenton, 2018). [China has
also invaded the international areas of healthcare, medicine, life art,
tourism and cooking]{.underline} (Komlosy, 2016). One important point to
add is China\'s rise with manufacturing Multinational Corporations
(MNCs) which often outperform USA MNCs is another problem to consider
(Griffiths & Luciani, 2011; Knight, 2014). Projections show that the
Asian tiger is anticipated to overtake the USA economically by 2041
(Knight, 2014). Despite the role of China in being the leading figure in
the discussion of the challenging the USA hegemony, the [BRICS countries
at large are also engaged in efforts of countering the USA
dominance]{.underline} of international finance. Relevant example
include that they were able to launch a New Development Bank (NDB) in
2017. This has another important emerging power pattern found in BRICS,
particularly as it relates to the International finance (Ernstzen,
2015). This emerging international economic Power Pattern had also
invested heavily in the property investment esp. in the former
industrialized countries (Komlosy, 2016[). BRICS is also anticipated to
overtake and outperform the combination of the United Kingdom (UK),
Germany, France, Italy and Japan by at least the late 2030s]{.underline}
(Kim, 2010). A number of trade agreements have also been established in
Latin America to counter the US hegemony over trade such as the Bolivian
Alternative of Americas (ALBA) to counter USA\'s hegemony over the
Caribbean and Latin America\'s perpetuated trade hegemony (Fox, 2019).

### UQ -- Unsustainable -- East Asia

#### U.S heg in East Asia is impossible

INDO-PACIFIC INFLUENCE", Defense Priorities,
https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/the-inevitable-rise-of-china

The final thing the [U.S. should do is stop signaling its hopes of
fundamentally changing who holds power in Beijing and instead focus on
its own affairs]{.underline}. In July 2020, Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo gave a speech on China that some hawks interpreted as calling for
a policy of regime change. Critics of Beijing regularly argue that the
Chinese take too dogmatic an approach to issues of national sovereignty,
all but admitting that mutual hostility between the powers is rooted in
the desire of many in the U.S. to overthrow the government of Xi Jinping
and end CCP rule, if not militarily than by encouraging internal
discord. Of course, the [U.S. has no ability to overthrow, at acceptable
cost, the Chinese government or fundamentally change its political
culture. Setting such goals makes cooperation in areas like disease
prevention and climate change more difficult]{.underline}.

[Throughout history, countries have exercised power abroad due to
economic success, the factor on which great power influence rests. For
the U.S. to compete with China, it should invest internally:
infrastructure improvements, GDP growth, improved educational outcomes,
and other measures to increase innovation and wealth creation. While
such goals are difficult to achieve, it is easy to see that increasing
spending on a military competition with China in its own backyard is not
helpful.]{.underline}

[U.S. influence in East Asia is destined to diminish]{.underline}, but
that does not make America less safe. [Those most fearful of China who
call for more military spending, overextension, and a commitment to
marshalling allies do not present any policy ideas that can reverse
underlying trends, even if adopted]{.underline}. Throughout the
Indo-Pacific, China has the advantages of geography and a relatively
passive attitude toward the affairs of the rest of the world. [While
those advantages will continue, it is in the process of approaching and
surpassing the U.S. in all measures of economic power, and to a great
extent in technological and scientific achievement, all of which can be
converted into superior military strength if there is a will to do so.
That reality is an argument to strengthen the U.S. internally to prepare
for long-term competition, if necessary. Old habits of thinking, overly
optimistic analyses assuming Chinese decline or collapse, and ignoring
the basic principle of compound growth have prevented the U.S. from
grappling with the speed and magnitude of the shifting balance of power
we are experiencing. Washington is left with the choice of either
adjusting to the new reality or risking catastrophe to try and stop what
is inevitable.]{.underline}

President [Biden's vision of competition with China requires the U.S. to
look inward. As he correctly recognizes, a country that cannot solve
problems at home will be in no position to preserve its influence
abroad]{.underline}. However, if the [U.S. is to ensure democracy wins
the war of ideas, the world's most important democracy cannot set
standards that are impossible to meet. Making America a model for the
rest of the world is achievable, while maintaining itself as the
dominant power in East Asia in the face of a rising China is
not.]{.underline} All policies related to great power competition should
proceed with that understanding in mind.

The obvious questions to be asked are these[: What has happened between
the 1990s, when the power of the United States reached its apex, and
now? How did America's gigantic leverage upon a substantial part of the
world weaken to the point of losing true relevance? Two names can
provide the answers to these questions: George W. Bush and Donald
Trump.]{.underline} In 2001, George W. Bush's team came into government
carrying an awkward notion about America's might. Instead of
understanding that the hegemonic system in place served their country's
interests exceedingly well, [they felt that the system had to be
rearranged in order to recognize the United States' new position as sole
superpower and its unmistakable primacy. As a result, they began to turn
upside down a complex structure that had taken decades to build,
precisely when America's standing within it had reached its
pinnacle.]{.underline} 78 A. T. HARDY In doing so they did not
understand, as T.V. Paul asserts, that legitimacy lowers the cost of
exerting power and that for a hegemonic power legitimacy results
fundamental for the maintaining of supremacy. [The United States had
attained a stage where its supremacy was accepted by the international
community as both benign and legitimate]{.underline}, which had required
interweaving the exercise of its power with international institutions
and legal instruments. However, proclaiming the futility of cooperative
multilateralism, which from their perspective just constrained the
freedom of action of America's power, the Bush administration asserted
the prerogatives of their country's primacy. [Moreover, the United
States' national interest had to take precedence to international law,
as was made clear by President Bush before the 2003 invasion of
Iraq.]{.underline} During that time, he repeatedly [emphasized that even
if such invasion violated international law, his country would do
whatever was necessary to ensure its security (Paul, 2018, Chapter
2]{.underline}). Unconcerned by international norms or by the United
Nations' rules, America became a free rider within the international
system. Among many examples, the following are particularly telling: It
[refused to adhere to the Kyoto Protocol]{.underline}, as that would
have imposed restraints upon its sovereignty, notwithstanding that with
just 4 percent of the world's population the country was [responsible
for 25 percent of the global pollution footprint; it refused to submit
to the International Court of Justice, while pressuring other countries
to follow suit, as its soldiers were being accused of human rights
violations in Afghanistan and Iraq]{.underline}; it refused to pay its
quotas to the United Nations and to other multilateral organizations
that did not bow to Washington's views (Prestowitz, 2003). [The Bush
administration's world became one that searched for unconditional
followers and not for allies' worthy of respect]{.underline}; one of ad
hoc coalitions and "with us or against us" propositions where
multilateral institutions and norms had little meaning; one of
punishment to dissidence and not of encouragement to cooperation; and
one where preventive action prevailed over international law. Well-known
neoconservatives such as Charles Krauthammer, Robert Kagan, and John
Bolton, proclaimed America's supremacy and derided countries not willing
to follow its unilateralism. Krauthammer labelled those nations an axis
of petulance, whose main problem was their irrelevance. Kagan, referring
to Europe's insistence in adhering to international norms, talked about
that continent's weakness and about its incapability to understand that
raw power was the ultimate enforcer of national security. Bolton
asserted that if the United Nations' Security Council wanted to reflect
the real correlation of power in the world, it should only have one
member: The United States (Kagan, 2003, p. 37; Krauthammer, 2002; Toro
Hardy, 2006 \[1, p. 139\]).

[The renewal of great power competition was acknowledged alongside other

### UQ -- Unsustainable -- Inflation

#### Inflation is Decking U.S. Military Power Now

Thomas **Spoehr 6/7 --** Thomas Spoehr serves as director of Heritage's
Center for National Defense where he is responsible for supervising
research on matters involving U.S. national defense, "The U.S. Army's
Untenable Trajectory: What Congress Should Do to Fix It", The Heritage
Foundation

Despite claims the Army's fiscal year (FY) 2023 President's budget
request "sustains the force on a strategic path," the opposite is true.
[The \$46 billion cumulative loss of buying power that the Army has
endured since FY 2020 has taken a severe toll on nearly every aspect of
Army combat]{.underline} power. Budgets that have consistently failed to
even keep pace with inflation have forced the Army to cut training
standards, propose reducing its active end strength, cut military
construction programs to historic lows, and pare many key modernization
programs down to the bone. The latest rating from The Heritage
Foundation's authoritative Index of U.S. Military Strength assesses [the
Army as only "marginally" able to perform its role to protect the U.S.
and its vital national interests. Any objective assessment would
conclude the Army is on an unsustainable path.]{.underline}

[The lack of publicly released national security and national defense
strategies from this Administration makes it challenging to understand
the thinking behind President Joe Biden's decision to sharply reduce the
Army's buying power]{.underline}.

[The return of war to Central Europe should serve as a powerful reminder
that land combat remains a real possibility and that the maintenance of
ready ground forces remains a crucial element of U.S. national security.
President Biden's FY 2023 defense budget for the Army belies none of
that urgency]{.underline}. Now that the long-delayed FY 2023 defense
budget has been released, it is obvious the trends observed in
Heritage's earlier report, "Congress Should Address the Impact of Four
Years of Declining Buying Power on the U.S. Army," have only
accelerated.

In accordance with the law, [on April 7, 2022, the Army Chief of Staff
General James McConville submitted an Unfunded Priority List totaling
\$5.1 billion. The breadth and magnitude of the list reveals the
challenges the Army is facing. Specific shortfalls in Army readiness,
capacity, and capabilities can be found in the Index of U.S. Military
Strength. Many of the programs on this list are worthy and Congress
should support this request while identifying offsets and savings in
other areas to pay for these line items.]{.underline} The Heritage
Foundation's Blueprint for Balance contains multiple recommendations
where money could be saved in the federal budget, both in the defense
budget and in other areas[. Congress should further investigate what the
cumulative impact of under-funding the Army has been over the past three
years and act to fix those specific shortfalls.]{.underline}

### UQ -- Unsustainable -- Laundry List

#### US Heg is already dying\--Trump, a rising China, Populism, and Nationalism

**Boller et al. 21** -- Florian Boller is from the Department of
Political Science, University of Kaiseslautern, other contributors from
array of different universities and institutions like JFKI, School of
Government and International Relations, etc. "Hegemonic Transition,"
2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021,
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-74505-9

[The current international order is unraveling]{.underline}. Its
traditional hegemon, the US, has ceased to unequivocally support the
institutions it helped to foster. [Us President Donald Trump's "America
First" policy has exacerbated ongoing forces pushing international
politics toward a hegemonic transition. China's power surge,
contestation by smaller states, and the West's internal struggles with
populism and economic discontent have undermined the liberal order from
the outside, and from within]{.underline}. While a diagnosis of this
crisis is hardly new (acharya, 2018;Eilstrup-Sangiovanni & Hofmann,
2019; Friedrichs et al., 2019), its sources, scope, and underlying
politics are still up for debate. This volume offers an assessment of
the ongoing transformation of hegemonic order and its domestic and
international politics. In doing so, it challenges the conventional
wisdom in three ways. First, the role of the US under the Trump
administration with regard to the liberal order is more complex than it
may seem. It varies across regimes (e.g., trade and security), regions
(e.g., Asia, Europe, the Global South), and is domestically contested by
actors within Congress and society. After all, states are not unitary
actors whose governments are free to decide the course of their
countries, regardless of domestic institutions, voters\' interest, and
partisan politics. The upending of traditional leadership paths by the
Trump administration, in fact, was contested by traditionalists within
the executive, and, more importantly, within the legislature. Thus, this
argument demands a closer look at the connection between domestic
politics and international relations, and the resulting patterns of
hegemonic politics across policy fields and regions. Second, there is
significant variance in the responses of state and non-state actors
toward this instability and disruptive transformation. Some actors forge
new alliances, claim authority over policies or within institutions.?
Others, in particular allies of the US, such as Poland within NATO, or
Israel, who significantly depend on the hegemon\'s security provisions,
reject leadership roles for themselves and try to entice the US to
maintain its traditional role. Middle powers such as India and Brazil
may find themselves wedged between the US and China, and their room for
strategic maneuvering will be severely limited. It is thus [a central
aim of this volume to dissect contestation and support toward the
current hegemonic order (and the traditional hegemon) among different
actors.]{.underline} Third, while the topical focus of our endeavor is
the age of Trump and the crisis of the international order, we recognize
the [longer-term trends that have paved the way toward the current
hegemonic transition. Economic discontents within large swaths of the
electorates in the US and in Europe have, for example, propelled
populist and nationalism movements that, in turn, undermined support for
maintaining policies and institutions within the liberal
order]{.underline} (see Inglehart & Norris, 2016; Lammert and Werner in
this volume). [Furthermore, the traditional bipartisan foreign policy
consensus, which provided the domestic backbone of the liberal order,
has begun to erode since the end of the Cold War]{.underline} (see
Schultz, 2017). In that regard, we hold that the Trump administration
and its policies are a symptom rather than the cause of the unraveling
of global order (see ye, 2019, p. 76). Consequently, [the crisis of the
global order will not simply vanish with the leadership change in the
White House on January 20, 2021.]{.underline} Against such a backdrop,
this volume contributes to the burgeoning discussion within the
international relations (I) literature by offering theoretically
informed case studies. Our reading [of hegemony diverges from a static
concept toward a focus on the dynamic politics of hegemonic order. This
perspective includes domestic support and the demand for specific
hegemonic goods, the contestation and support by other actors within
distinct layers of hegemonic orders, and the underlying bargaining

### UQ -- China

#### China has Regional Hegemony Now -- US Asia Hegemony Declining

INDO-PACIFIC INFLUENCE", Defense Priorities,
https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/the-inevitable-rise-of-china

This report investigates the long-term implications of Chinese regional
hegemony. In a world in which the two powers are peer competitors, the
future is uncertain, and leaders are free to make decisions across a
wide range of possibilities likely to fundamentally change facts on the
ground. [When, in a certain region, one nation has an overwhelming
preponderance of power, we can be more confident it will dominate that
area as long as it desires to do so. While we cannot predict much about
what China will use its power for, at the very least we should expect it
to seek to gain more influence in its region at the expense of the U.S.
and become more likely to succeed in disputes between the two nations in
which each side seeks out the cooperation of others. China will be able
to assert economic and diplomatic dominance over its own region even if
the U.S. maintains or increases its military presence in nations like
Japan and South Korea.]{.underline}

[Checking the rise of China through alliances is unlikely, as the
countries of East Asia generally do not see it as a threat to the same
extent the U.S. does; nor do they share concerns about the internal
human rights situation of that country or other issues]{.underline},
like autonomy for Hong Kong, [that American policymakers have
prioritized]{.underline}. Moreover[, contemporary military alliances in
East Asia actually give the U.S. little in terms of diplomatic
advantage]{.underline}, as disputes over Huawei and other issues reveal.
[Even if other countries become more willing to let the U.S. defend them
militarily, American influence can still decline. Given these facts, and
the greater ability of China to bring about economic and diplomatic
pressure on the region due to geography, East Asian countries are more
likely to accommodate it than the U.S. while avoiding decisively
aligning with either power.]{.underline}

[While American leaders talk about ways to "confront
China"---]{.underline}which usually involves some combination of
stressing human rights, economic decoupling, and expanding military
commitments in the Indo-Pacific---[none of their suggestions will
fundamentally alter the power shift currently underway]{.underline}.
Given this reality, the [U.S. should pursue two goals in the coming
decades: (1) increase its prosperity through trade and (2) avoid crises
and war.]{.underline} On this last point, [that can be done by reducing
its military footprint; limiting provocative actions, like unnecessary
freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea or declaring
that U.S. forces will defend Taiwan; and halting even implicit calls for
regime change]{.underline}. This would not only decrease tensions, but
also potentially help the human rights situation in China by reducing
perceptions of threat. [Effectively pursuing long-term American
interests in the region must begin with clarity about what the U.S. can
realistically accomplish given its distance from East Asia and weakening
position over time. Those hoping democracy will win out in the global
marketplace of ideas should focus less of their energy on foreign
confrontation and more on reforming domestic institutions.]{.underline}

#### 00s crises devastated US econ allowing east Asia to counterbalance US globalization

In 1990, conservative political columnist Charles Krauthammer claimed
that a "unipolar moment" (Krauthammer, 1990) had arrived. [The US, as
the only superpower, clearly overlooked the rest of the world as the
former Soviet Union collapsed, Japan fell into stagnation, and Europe
was experiencing a difficult transaction period]{.underline}. After a
short period, the [US conducted a series of strategic propaganda based
on the Washington Consensus to promote and enforce
globalization]{.underline}, with the 1990s becoming the longest economic
expansion in US history. However, during the 21 st century, with Europe
successfully combining and expanding its economic map into an
institution known as the [European Union (EU),]{.underline} [regional
economic integration become a key feature that counter-balanced the
influence of globalization]{.underline}. Furthermore, newly developing
countries such as [India, South Africa, Russia and, particularly, China
rapidly merged into the global economy]{.underline}, claiming a
significant share of the stake. On the other hand, [after the terrorist
attacks of September 11, 2001, the US found itself trapped in two wars
against terrorism in the Middle East for more than a
decade]{.underline}. [These wars dramatically shifted the trajectory of
the US' politics, both domestically and internationally, and almost
completely drained resources from the US economy]{.underline}. What made
it worse for the US was the [2007 subprime mortgage crisis, followed by
the global financial crisis in 2008]{.underline}. [These crises had a
profound and devastating effect on the US with respect to its status as
a super power and hegemon.]{.underline}

7-17-2022, AB

[Activity by U.S. military ships and surveillance planes directed toward
China has increased significantly under President Joe Biden's
administration, a spokesperson for the Chinese Defense Ministry said
Thursday. As an example, Wu Qian said the Navy's Arleigh Burke-class
destroyer Mustin had recently conducted close-in observation of the
Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning and its battle group.]{.underline}
That had "seriously interfered with the Chinese side's training
activities and seriously threatened the safety of navigation and
personnel on both sides," Wu said. [The ship had been warned to leave
and a formal protest filed with the U.S., he said. "Who wins when part
of one force goes up against all of a hostile force? That's the question
we may see put to the test. The answer is far from obvious." By Geoff
Ziezulewicz Activity by U.S. military ships was up 20 percent and by
planes 40 percent in areas China claims since Biden took office in
January over the same period last year, Wu said]{.underline}. ["The U.S.
frequently dispatches ships and planes to operate in seas and airspace
near China, promoting regional militarization and threatening regional
peace and stability," Wu said at a monthly briefing held
virtually.]{.underline} China routinely objects to the U.S. military
presence in the South China Sea, which it claims virtually in its
entirety, as well as the passage of Navy ships through the Taiwan
Strait. The country recently marked the 20th anniversary of the
collision between a U.S. surveillance plane and a Chinese navy fighter
near the Chinese island province of Hainan that resulted in the Chinese
pilot's death. He was called a hero who sacrificed himself for the
defense of the motherland. [The U.S. says its plane was in international
airspace and the accident was the result of reckless flying by the
Chinese side. Wu also blasted moves to beef up monitoring of Chinese
aircraft movements by Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy
claimed by China as its own territory to be annexed by force if
necessary. Taiwan's government to stave off what China refers to as
inevitable unification are like "a mantis trying to stop a chariot," Wu
said.]{.underline} The U.S. maintains only unofficial relations with
Taiwan in deference to Beijing, but provides the island with defensive
weapons and is legally bound to treat threats to it as matters of "grave
concern." [Increased activity by the Chinese military around Taiwan has
been raising concerns about the possibility of a conflict. In an
interview with Britain's Sky News, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry Joseph Wu
reiterated recent warnings that the military threat from China is
growing through "misinformation campaigns, hybrid warfare, and \... grey
zone activities." "And all these seem to be preparing for their final
military assault against Taiwan," Wu told Sky. "This is our country,
this is our people and this is our way of life. We will defend ourselves
to the very end," Wu said]{.underline}. Biden did not address such
military threats in his address to Congress on Wednesday night, instead
emphasizing that China and others were "closing in fast" in economic and
technological terms. "We're in a competition with China and other
countries to win the 21st century," Biden said.

#### China war escalates

**Hu Bo 20**, Chinese novelist and film director \"China-US Military
Confrontation in the South China Sea: Fact and Fiction,\" xx-xx-xxxx,
https://thediplomat.com/2020/06/china-us-military-confrontation-in-the-south-china-sea-fact-and-fiction/,
7-17-2022, AB

[No one doubts that the military competition and frictions are real and
serious between China and the United States in the South China Sea, when
they have rivalrous intentions, tit-for-tat strategies, and daily
operational confrontations. China is accused of coercing U.S. allies and
partners, militarizing disputed features, and seeking regional hegemony,
and the United States is considered to be playing the South China Sea
card and containing China's rise as a maritime power]{.underline}. In
the context of overall intensified strategic competition between the two
countries, the South China Sea is even less likely to be an exception.
But the question remains: how fierce will the competition be? [When
every day is filled with news of maritime standoffs between China and
the United States, many may wonder, will China and the U.S. slip into
military conflict? Both sides have reasons to maintain and expand their
military presence in the South China Sea. China is the largest littoral
state of the South China Sea, and has important interests at stake:
territorial sovereignty, jurisdictional waters, and sea lanes of
communication. With China's military modernization, it is natural that
more and more military platforms are active in the area. Meanwhile the
United States thinks highly of maritime predominance, freedom of
navigation, and security commitments to regional states.]{.underline}
[Thus, since the end of World War II, the United States has maintained
the most powerful military presence and executed a variety of complex
military operations in the South China Sea. For a long time after World
War II, due to China's weak naval and air forces, there were not many
chances for Chinese and American military forces to encounter each other
at sea.]{.underline} However, [much has changed in the past
decade]{.underline}. On the one hand, [China's capacity has rapidly
increased, and the progress of the navy and air force is particularly
impressive. On the other hand, the United States has grown increasingly
worried about China's rising power and significantly strengthened its
naval and air presence since 2009. U.S. aircraft sorties increased by
100 percent to about 1,500, and surface ship presence increased by 60
percent to around 1,000 ship days per year]{.underline}. In this
context, frequent military- to-military encounters are inevitable. The
U.S. military is used to being unparalleled and unchallengeable in the
South China Sea and is not ready to accommodate China's maritime rise.
[Although the People's Liberation Army is already very strong
materially, it is still a novice spiritually and in the process of
learning how to interact with its American counterparts as a mature
power]{.underline}. But neither side seems to have much to offer other
than peaceful coexistence. If both sides develop normally, in terms of
power, the future of the South China Sea would be a bipolar region,
regardless what kind of intentions they have. Moreover, most countries
in the region are reluctant to take sides in the China-U.S. power
competition. Therefore, it is hard for either side to re-establish a
dominant order here. As the power distribution becomes more balanced,
the idea of a managed military conflict is fanciful[. One side's
provocation will inevitably invite the other's retaliation, where spiral
escalation is highly possible. Considering that both sides have so many
weapon platforms and both are major nuclear powers, the feasibility of a
military solution has greatly diminished.]{.underline} The China-U.S.
rivalry in the South China Sea is certainly growing, but war is still
some way off[. There are several maritime encounters between the two
sides every day, and thousands every year. Most of them are professional
and safe; only a few have involved some risks.]{.underline} [The recent
pandemic has made both countries and militaries more sensitive, which,
to some extent, has heightened the tension of the situation. Because of
COVID-19, China and the United States are more concerned and anxious
about each other. In addition to maintaining daily operations in the
western Pacific, both sides have some new worries. The United States is
concerned that China would take advantage of the temporary power vacuum;
thus it has deliberately shown more force and given China more
diplomatic pressure]{.underline}. China feels that Washington's South
China Sea policy is increasingly desperate to the point that, even
during the pandemic, the United States has not forgotten to provoke
China. Beijing is also convinced that the U.S., motivated by power
competition, is focusing on China's activities and ignoring the actions
of other claimants[. From mid-April to early May, the U.S. Navy
dispatched several warships, including USS America LHA-6, to the
so-called standoff area between the Haiyang Dizhi 8 and the West Capella
to deter China's operations. The PLA Navy was believed to have a similar
number of warships there at the same time, which aroused heated
discussion among the media and experts.]{.underline} [Another less
publicized but more intense case was the reconnaissance and
counter-reconnaissance of China's aircraft carrier Liaoning formation
when it was conducting open sea cross-region mobile training while
followed by American warships and multiple military aircraft. An
anonymous PLA Navy officer revealed that the confrontation was so
intense that one U.S. warship even once came within 100 meters of the
Chinese carrier. Even so, both sides have remained largely professional
and restrained.]{.underline} In fact, neither the Chinese military nor
the American military has increased its activity significantly compared
with the same period of 2019, despite the impression given by most media
reports and expert commentaries. The problem is that these operations
are over-exposed and over-focused[. In the backdrop of power
competition, especially amid the pandemic, in order to show their
strength and determination, U.S. forces have given undue prominence to
covering and publicizing military activities, giving the media and the
public a lot to discuss and imagine. There are some hawks in both
countries who take advantage of this and exaggerate the situation.
Although most countries including the South China Sea claimants, do not
want to see China-U.S. military conflict, some individual countries are
indeed rejoicing over the growing competition between China and the
United States, which may lead to some opportunity for them to
expand.]{.underline} China-U.S. military confrontation or even war in
the South China Sea has a huge market[. China and the United States are,
of course, preparing for any kind of military conflict and the worst
scenarios in the South China Sea; however, there is no indication that
the two sides want to resolve their contradictions by using force
strategically or operationally --- despite the repeated war rhetoric
from some senior American officials]{.underline}. In daily military
interactions, there are really increasing risks, but in the absence of a
subjective desire for conflict, these risks are highly likely to be
controlled. [The most important thing for the Chinese and American
militaries to prevent is miscalculation]{.underline}, considering the
relatively backward or ineffective crisis management mechanisms of the
two countries even compared with Soviet-U.S. and then Russia-U.S.
military relations. In addition, we need to let professionals do their
work. The China-U.S. military rivalry has been unduly influenced by the
media, commentators, and some politicians, which amplifies the intensity
of the competition and is likely to lead to self-fulfilling prophecies.

### China -- Trade

#### The fight for hegemony is a threat to global peace: drives US-China trade conflict and creates military and political friction 

**Kim 19 -** Min-hyung; Department of Political Science and
International Relations, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea; "A
real driver of US--China trade conflict," 4 February 2019, Emerald
Publishing Limited, <https://doi.org/10.1108/ITPD-02-2019-003>

According to the conventional wisdom[, trade is not]{.underline} a
[zero-sum game, but]{.underline} a [positive-sum]{.underline} game. In
other words, by [allowing countries to focus on producing the goods that
they can]{.underline} [produce relatively efficiently, free trade is
largely beneficial for everyone involved]{.underline}. This is the
theory of comparative advantage that underpins international trade.
[Putting up trade]{.underline} [barriers makes it hard for people to
access cheaper goods and raises the costs of living]{.underline},
thereby making everyone worst off in the long-run. Indeed, the efforts
of the removal of trade barriers since the Second World War have driven
the unprecedented world's economic growth thus far. [Then, why are the
world's two largest economies (i.e. the USA and China)
currently]{.underline} [engaged in a trade war, which is likely to hurt
their own economies?]{.underline} The trade war between the USA and
China will [also have negative consequences on the global economy since
it will]{.underline} [slow down the world's economic growth, among
others.]{.underline} What is the driving force for the trade war between
the two economic giants? The main goal of this paper is to offer an
explanation of the underlying cause of the Sino--US trade war. [In an
effort to make sense of the trade war, the paper draws the insights
from]{.underline} [the two international relations theories -- i.e.
hegemonic stability theory (HST) and power]{.underline} [transition
theory (PTT)]{.underline}. Its central thesis is that **["US fear" about
its declining hegemony and]{.underline}** **[China's rapid rise as a
challenger of US hegemony is driving a US-launched trade war
with]{.underline}** **[China.]{.underline}** Since [the underlying cause
of the trade war between the world's two largest economies]{.underline}
[is political]{.underline} (i.e. the Sino--US hegemonic rivalry[) rather
than economic]{.underline} (e.g. US attempts to improve the trade
balance with China by imposing tariffs on Chinese goods), the article
contends that the full understanding of the trade war requires close
attention to the importance of power competition between the two
superpowers. [As China continues to]{.underline} [threaten US hegemony
in the world in general and East Asia in particular, the
US--China]{.underline} [competition for hegemony will intensify over
time]{.underline} (Kim, 2016a). A s a result, the trade war between the
two countries may persist longer than many anticipate. Further, **[even
if the trade]{.underline}** **[war between the two superpowers ends
soon, a similar type of conflict is likely to occur later]{.underline}**
**[as long as the Sino--US hegemonic rivalry continues.]{.underline}**

[The [overweening character of the US project means]{.mark} that [it is
bound to fail in the end]{.mark}, though [at a terrible human
cost]{.mark}. [The resistance of its victims]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
the peoples of the South --- [[will grow stronger]{.mark} as [the
Americans become bogged down in the many war fronts]{.mark} to which
they are forced to commit themselves]{.underline}. [[The resistance
will]{.mark} eventually [defeat the enemy]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
perhaps also awaken public opinion in the United States, as it did in
the case of the Vietnam War. But [[it would be much better to
halt]{.mark} the [catastrophe sooner]{.mark} --- which [international
diplomacy could succeed in doing]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially if
Europe measured up to its responsibilities.

### Imperialism

#### US Hegemony Hold up Imperialism and is Inherently Bad

Joseph **Choonara** 20**22 -** Joseph Choonara teaches International
Political Economy at King\'s College London. He is the author of
Unravelling Capitalism: A Guide to Marxist Political Economy, a
columnist for the magazine Socialist Review and an editorial board
member of International Socialism journal, "The devastation of Ukraine:
NATO, Russia and imperialism", Research Gate

[After the Second World War]{.underline}, the configuration of
imperialism changed in important ways. Many of the former colonies were
able to throw out their rulers, achieving formal independence, even if
remaining in a subordinate position economically. Meanwhile, [the
US's]{.underline} rulers, having [emerged from the war with by far the
most powerful economy---a status they maintained in the decades that
followed---sought to create an imperialist order based not on colonies
but on open markets. Powerful corporations, built around the US's mass
production industries, would possess major advantages in this arena.
Meanwhile, the dollar would underpin the global financial system, again
conferring advantages on the US. Finally, US military power would
outstrip that of any potential rivals within the Western
world.]{.underline}

[During the Cold War, the Soviet Union and its allies were excluded from
the liberal market system, instead organizing their economies as more or
less autarkic "bureaucratic state-capitalisms", each functioning
somewhat like a single giant enterprise, with the state bureaucracy
directing production.]{.underline}

[The formation of two competing blocs of capitalist powers, with the
leading state in each armed with nuclear weapons, led to a "partial
dissociation of economic and political power". In the Western bloc, the
Japanese and European economies were reconstructed, the latter
increasingly integrated through the forerunners of the EU, under the
political and military leadership of the US.]{.underline} Although there
could be sharp economic tensions within this bloc, they did not result
in military clashes.

[The wars that erupted during the Cold War typically took the form of
proxy conflicts, in which one or other of the superpowers might
intervene directly, but in which both avoided a direct confrontation.
The overall global order remained broadly fixed: "Both the US and the
Soviet Union, at least in the period of détente in the 1960s and 1970s,
were willing to regard themselves and each other as status quo powers
with no interest in revisiting the post-war settlement".]{.underline}

https://www.cato.org/commentary/us-should-not-lead-world

[After two decades of U.S. "leadership" in the Middle East]{.underline},
what is the result? [A series of nations wrecked. New terrorist
organizations created. Even more new enemies made.]{.underline}
[Thousands of Americans killed. Tens of thousands of U.S. personnel
wounded. Hundreds of thousands of foreign civilians killed. Even more
wounded. Millions of people displaced. Trillions of dollars
squandered]{.underline}. Heckuva job, Washington! Let's have some more
American leadership. [Yet even the slightest suggestion that the U.S.
step back anywhere generates horrified, frenetic
opposition.]{.underline} The president's proposals to withdraw troops
from countries as disparate as Afghanistan, Germany, Iraq, South Korea,
and Syria triggered sustained bouts of wailing and gnashing of teeth in
Washington and overseas. [Not only must America lead, it must always
lead, and once having led anywhere, it must forever lead]{.underline}
everywhere. No retreats, substitutions, or transformations are allowed.
[This]{.underline} fixation on U.S. leadership [amounts to a
self‐​fulfilling prophecy. If nothing can be accomplished without
America, then other nations will act as if nothing can be accomplished
without America. Which means they will not act. And nothing will be
accomplished]{.underline} without Washington.

<https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/10/11/declining-american-hegemony-could-be-good-thing>

Much of the [U. S. hegemony has stemmed from the fact that the United
States is]{.underline} surely [the most heavily armed and]{.underline}
most [militarily active country]{.underline} in the world. [The national
myth is that we use military force reluctantly and only when it is
necessary to insure human rights, peace, and security]{.underline}. But
[let's look at the record]{.underline}: Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Cuba, Grenada, Dominican Republic, Chile, Central America,
Libya, Congo, Iran, Iraq, Panama, Afghanistan. Are any of these places
were made better as a consequences of our covert and overt actions? We
spend more on weapons of war than any other country in the world.
Researchers at Brown University have found that since the horror of

### China Rise\-\--General

#### China is able to become the new global hegemon and is establishing ties with many US allies.

Sabah,
https://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/columns/global-leadership-crisis-the-us-hegemony-vs-china

With its cutting-edge technology, economic growth, military power and
huge population, [China is the second most influential global actor
after the U.S.]{.underline} On the one hand, [China positions itself
against Western hegemony]{.underline}. For this reason, it spearheaded
the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which is
considered the new other of NATO. It has been preparing itself to
introduce a new set of global rules in the near future. On the other
hand, China [has been trying to establish economic institutions as an
alternative to the United Nations\' specialized organizations such as
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. It is now ready to
provide financial resources to other countries for different kinds of
projects.]{.underline} It has hired or bought many seaports worldwide in
order to solidify its position globally. [It has begun to steal allies
from the U.S. as well. Many countries that are close to the U.S., such
as European countries and Israel, have begun to improve their relations
with China. Many African and Middle Eastern countries consider China as
one of their closest economic and political partners.]{.underline}
Therefore, it can easily be assumed that [the Chinese challenge for
global hegemony is in the making. The only reason why China has not
claimed global hegemony is timing.]{.underline} In other words,
according to the Chinese leadership, China is not yet ready for global
hegemony. [When China begins to involve itself in the political and
economic affairs of other countries and steer them away from the U.S., a
global confrontation will become inevitable.]{.underline} At that time,
the U.S. is not sure how many countries will continue to remain on its
side. [Many European countries may remain indifferent to a possible
confrontation between the U.S. and China in the Indo-Pacific
region.]{.underline} The position of some global powers such as India
against Chinese global power is clear, while many others may remain
neutral in case of increased confrontation. [Although Russia seems
closer to China and European countries seem closer to the U.S., their
position may change]{.underline} over time. The [position of many global
and regional powers is not fixed.]{.underline} These states may swing
between the two fronts.

[China\'s rise seems currently unstoppable, especially in light of the
decline of the US and the West in]{.underline} general. [While we are
likely to see a continuation of these trends in coming years, China\'s
rise will at some point reach its limits]{.underline}, given the
intrinsic weaknesses we outlined in this article. Similarly, [we will
likely see further military retreat by the US]{.underline}. [US
isolationism]{.underline} is not a new phenomenon but [took new forms
under]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline} administration. [Despite
declarations of the Biden administration that "the US is back", we will
see a decrease in US presence abroad. The only countervailing factor
will be demand for US presence by its allies.]{.underline} A big
difference, however, between the Trump administration\'s policy and that
of the Biden administration is that the former pursued a "go alone"
policy, while the latter is pursuing a policy of strengthening its
alliances with democratic countries. [The rise of China and its
increasing international assertiveness has led to a trade war under the
Trump administration. Calls for decoupling from China may lead to a
partial dismantling of globalization, which would be economically very
hurtful.]{.underline} We can, however, not ignore the fact that [China
has been using other countries' growing trade dependence on China as a
political instrument in its strategy to create a system of tributary
states.]{.underline} A possible solution in my view is to develop
"political trade deals" under the auspices of the WTO. In such deals,
countries would agree not to hold up each other in case of political
frictions. To make such deals credible, there should be an agreed to
system of sanctions in case of lack of respect of the trade deal by one
of the parties. To make such a system of sanctions credible, countries
participating in such deals would have to agree to deposit large sums of
money with the WTO as a guarantee for possible future sanctions. Putting
such a system in place is easier said than done and would require
extensive multilateral negotiations and a restructuring of the current
multilateral trade system as well as of the WTO. Whether the WTO is
strong enough or the US-China tension is too strong to still make such a
system possible is of course to be seen. It would nevertheless be
preferrable to the current system of instability and the high risks of
implosion of the international trade system as was the case in the
1930s.

#### No hegemon stays a hegemon forever -- new countries naturally take the spot of old hegemons. This has happened for centuries; the present will be no different.

[The hegemon will rise and gradually die, just like any other being in
the world]{.underline}, behaving in accordance with the natural order of
the universe, [to be replaced by an emerging power. Many great powers
have risen to the top of the power hierarchy throughout history,
including ancient Rome, Germany, and the United Kingdom. For a time,
each was an indisputable hegemon, setting international rules and
bending the international order to their own objectives, but, as with
all other once-dominant powers, they too were forced to accept their
predestined fate of fading away.]{.underline} It is said that [the
hegemon's position is often at its most precarious when there is a new
rising power that can pose a challenge to it]{.underline}s hegemonic
position. [Such is the case with China]{.underline}'s rapid development
in recent decades. [Its high growth rates were startling, and over an
extended period it continued to be one of the fastest-growing economies
of the world. Therefore, it is not unexpected that its growth has made
the leading power -- the United States (US) -- extremely
uncomfortable.]{.underline} The rise of [China is seen to
threaten]{.underline} the [US]{.underline} preponderance of
[power]{.underline}, which has eventually led to the US-China trade war.
While there are numerous studies discussing the trade war, few have
employed a theoretical approach. Therefore, this article intends to
examine the dynamics of power relations between the US and China within
and beyond the context of the US-China trade war from two approaches---
power transition theory and soft power. We argue that China cannot
unseat the position of the US as a global hegemon within the next
decade. Using the example of the US-China trade war, this article also
attempts to extend the explanatory potential of power transition theory
by arguing that the outcome of a war initiated by a hegemon would likely
be in its favour due to the hegemon's ability to set and alter existing
rules.

#### If China woke from its slumbers, it would astonish the world.

Napoleon is said to have predicted that, when China woke from its
slumbers, it would \"astonish the world.\"  The Little Corporal was a
loquacious fellow who got much wrong but he seems to have gotten this
right. [In a mere three decades, China has risen from impotence and
backwardness to a leading position in global affairs.]{.underline} This
year [it will become the second biggest producer of goods and
services]{.underline}, something projected just five years ago to happen
only in 2020. China is clearly on the way to [regaining its historic
position as the world\'s largest economy]{.underline}, [displacing the
United States.]{.underline} (Given continued rapid growth in the Chinese
economy, slow growth elsewhere, and progressive revaluation of the
Renminbi Yuan, this could happen much sooner than many expect.) The
prospect of transcendent Chinese wealth and power, coupled with
[America\'s devaluation of its own political and economic prestige, has
led to mounting speculation about China\'s emergence as a global hegemon
to rival and]{.underline}, perhaps in time[, surpass the Uni ted
States. ]{.underline}

### China Rise\-\--Transition

#### China overtaking US hegemony will be peaceful - China uses economic measures rather than war to achieve hegemony

[When Britain]{.underline}'s Chancellor of the Exchequer, George
Osborne, unexpectedly [announced the UK's intention to join the
China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in mid-March 2015,
an unnerved US official could not hold back his concern 'about a
trend]{.underline} \[in the UK\] [toward constant accommodation of
China']{.underline} (Reference Watt, Lewis and BraniganWatt et al.
2015). [This]{.underline} rare instance of rebuking a close partner in
public, however, [did not prevent other US allies from following the
British example]{.underline}: in a domino-like manner other European
states, [Australia and South Korea followed suit. By March 2015,
fifty-seven countries, including non-Asian and G7 states, had applied
for membership of the AIIB]{.underline} (AIIB 2020). [Since then,
membership has grown to 102 members. China is increasingly ready and
able to openly challenge the hegemonic position of the United States in
international relations.]{.underline} Indeed, the academic debate about
the rise of China in international relations has long shifted from
discussing whether China will affect the existing international order to
debating about how it will do so. That is, the early literature
investigating the nature of China's rise in terms of a status quo or
revisionist orientation towards the existing international order
(Reference JohnstonJohnston 2003; Reference LegroLegro 2007; Reference
ChanChan 2008; Reference BuzanBuzan 2010; Reference Schweller and
PuSchweller and Pu 2011; Reference Kastner and SaundersKastner and
Saunders 2012; Reference Wuthnow, Xin and LinglingWuthnow, et al. 2012)
is being complemented by examinations of how China uses its economic
cloud to effectively influence the policy preferences of others in order
to protect its own (foreign) policy interests (Reference Flores-Macías
and KrepsFlores-Macías and Kreps 2013; Reference Fuchs and KlannFuchs
and Klann 2013; Reference KastnerKastner 2014; Reference StrüverStrüver
2017; Reference BaderBader 2019). Yet, the role that China has started
to take on in the new millennium goes much further than employing
economic statecraft in its bilateral relations (Reference Medeiros and
FravelMedeiros and Fravel 2003; Reference EconomyEconomy 2010). [China
now sees the UN 'as one of the key venues in which to demonstrate its
responsible Great Power status and its willingness to provide global
public goods' so as to gain legitimacy at home and abroad]{.underline}
(Reference FootFoot 2014:1088).Footnote1 Outside of the UN, [Xi
Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative signals the readiness for leadership
of the kind that 'America has not shown since the post-war days of the
Marshall Plan']{.underline} (The Economist 2017). More generally,
experts have noted a trend in China's foreign policy towards
're-engineering' -- or 'shadow diplomacy' as some have called it --
which involves the construction of new, supplementary international
platforms and institutions (Reference Heilmann, Rudolf, Huotari and
BuckowHeilmann et al. 2014; Reference WesleyWesley 2015). The AIIB is a
prime example thereof. To make sense of China's recent power-political
manoeuvres, this chapter builds on the concept of goods substitution and
on the categorisation of orientation towards the international system as
introduced in the earlier chapters of this book. While I am not
intending to reduce the establishment of the AIIB to power-political
considerations, I argue that [the AIIB was initiated as a
counter-hegemonic attempt targeted at the architecture of international
finance and at US dominance therein.]{.underline} The initiative's
effects in terms of deconcentrating power were only limited. But, while
largely conforming to the norms and standards of existing international
financial institutions (IFIs) and development banks, China was
successful in making all founding members subscribe to the principles of
non-conditionality and non-interference, which largely deviate from
current practices in development finance. [The AIIB]{.underline} serves
well as an illustrative case of goods substitution. It [was seen
primarily as a power-political maneuver by policy-makers in the United
States]{.underline} who feared that the AIIB would undermine governance
conditionality -- and hence political influence in lending countries --
in the short-term, and hollow out US supremacy in global finance in the
long run (Reference Callaghan and HubbardCallaghan and Hubbard 2016).
[Hence, US opposition and its attempts to prevent others from joining
the Chinese initiative]{.underline}. In addition, the case of the AIIB
sheds light on the demand-side dynamics of goods substitution and
illustrates how opportunistic hedging and uncoordinated herding by third
states may inadvertently undermine the existing order. The chapter
starts by placing the AIIB initiative in the context of the existing
international arrangements which the AIIB sought to substitute. Then, I
develop the argument that the AIIB -- initially thought of as a
revisionist counter-hegemonic initiative -- transformed into an
integrated part of the existing international financial architecture due
to the engagement of Western third states. I conclude by arguing that
goods substitution as an analytical lens may advance the study of
international relations by placing the mechanisms of power politics at
the centre of inquiry, being less obsessed with traditional security
concerns and, most importantly, attributing more agency to non-hegemonic
actors.

#### A decline in US hegemony leads to a more stable bilateral or multilateral international order led by China

**Aslan 21** -- Dr. Alli, Associate professor at the Political Science
and International Relations Department of Ibn Haldun University,
8/31/21, "ANALYSIS - The falling trend of US's global leadership role",
Anadolu Agency,
https://www.aa.com.tr/en/analysis/analysis-the-falling-trend-of-us-s-global-leadership-role/2351335#

[Firstly]{.underline}, developments at the regional level may become
more impactful compared to those at the global level in determining
international outcomes, as a result of the US's decline. This process
has been in place for some time already. Regional dynamics have become
more decisive in international politics as a result of the dominance of
unipolarity and, thus, the global power struggle falling off the agenda.
Conditions that would compel secondary states or regional powers to sit
on the US's tail in the context of global campaigns no longer exist.
Despite all its efforts, [the US has failed to unite countries against a
common enemy]{.underline}. It wasn't able to create a common enemy.
[Global politics was more effective in determining regional politics in
the bipolar world of the Cold War and the unipolar, US-led world of the
following 10-15 years.]{.underline} However, starting in the mid-2000s,
regional dynamics began to be more decisive in the foreign policy of
countries. [The influence of global dynamics on international politics
has decreased.]{.underline} For instance, [the conflicts and
institutionalization in regions such as the Far East, South Asia, Latin
America, South Africa, and the Middle East have started becoming
determined by the dynamics of the regions themselves, rather than by
global dynamics.]{.underline} [It wouldn't be surprising to
see]{.underline} this process reach the point where the regional level
is determining the global level. In the not-too-distant future, [the
international order determined by US unipolarity may be replaced by a
multipolar international order]{.underline} in which regional balances
form the poles. [Second]{.underline} of all, the significance of the
regional level is embodied in the rise of China. [China has]{.underline}
gradually [evolved into a regional hegemon in the last 50 years. The
next step for China is to transform]{.underline} from a regional power
[to a global one]{.underline}. [The US-centered unipolar and liberal
international order is the biggest obstacle to China's
growth]{.underline} initiative. Today, [we see that this struggle is
continued through the diplomatic tensions between the two
countries]{.underline}. The prolongation of [the downward trend of the
US and its withdrawal from certain regions will cause China to increase
its sphere of influence]{.underline}. We see that [China is approaching
Afghanistan without wasting any time.]{.underline} Moreover, we also see
that it's intimidating the Asian countries that are trying to surround
it, led by the US. [Any bit of space withdrawn from by the US is a
potential area of expansion for China.]{.underline} This process of
expansion will gradually transform China from a regional power to a
global one. It's becoming more and more clear that [the US can't stop
China]{.underline}. However, it's also not so easy to say that China's
path is clear of obstacles. Bigger obstacles await China, other than the
US. In the long run, other regional powers are more likely to be the
biggest obstacle to China's claim to global power. The future superpower
candidate China may have to share the current superpower's bitter fate
as well. [Thirdly, the global leadership role of the US will become more
and more questionable. It's natural for states to prioritize their own
interests and act accordingly.]{.underline} In addition, it's also a
fact of international politics that states establish alliance relations
with each other. Therefore, states must strike a healthy balance between
protecting their own interests and coming together with other states.
And, this becomes even more important in the hierarchical relations
between a strong state and a secondary or weak state (or actors). When
it comes to trust, secondary and small states are more sensitive, due to
the power asymmetry. The great power losing its credibility causes
brute-force calculations to form the basis of the relations. Therefore,
the authority of the great power is undermined and its superiority is
not seen as legitimate. This leads to the leadership of the great power
being questioned further by the secondary and small states. Perhaps [the
US's loss of soft power in international politics in the last 20 years
and the gradual erosion of trust in its leadership is more important
than the decline in its material capacities]{.underline} in recent
years. [The decision to withdraw from Afghanistan may be a breaking
point in this process]{.underline}. In fact, [the thesis that Trump's
US, which turned its back on its allies, was an anomaly and that the US,
with Joe Biden, is now standing by its allies once again has suffered a
great wound with the events in Afghanistan.]{.underline} The idea that
the US will easily leave an ally to its fate, regardless of who becomes
president, is gaining ground. Fourthly, the Taliban's victory may
encourage violent groups in other regions. The Taliban quickly lost
power following the 2001 invasion. It was out of the question for them
to make a stand against an enormous power like the US. However, the
material power of the US was not enough to establish an alternative
power structure to the Taliban in the country. Obtaining military
victory over small states or organizations is easy, but political
victory difficult. Because, the institutional structure forms naturally
in the historical process and gains legitimacy gradually. It's nearly
impossible to build an institutional structure while accelerating the
process with outside interventions. The structure can\'t be seen as
legitimate or comprehensive. The alternative to establishing an
institutional structure is centralizing the power around individuals. In
this case, corruption and instability would be inevitable. This is what
happened in Afghanistan; initially with the government of Hamid Karzai
and then with that of Ashraf Ghani. When the US understood that the
first option was impossible, it went with the second one. The difficulty
of obtaining political victories clearly demonstrates that time runs in
favor of organizations like the Taliban. It reveals that there is
opportunity for terrorist and violent organizations in societies damaged
by outside interventions. This situation whets the appetite of such
organizations. The clear application and validation of the theory in
Afghanistan will encourage violent groups elsewhere. This, in turn,
could lead to the US's control over international politics to diminish
further. Finally, leaving Afghanistan to the mercy of the Taliban will
result in the credibility of the US's democracy transfer policy hitting
rock bottom and realism gaining strength against liberalism. We mustn't
forget that [liberalism played an important role in the long-term
survival of the US's global supremacy. Liberalism has served many
functions, from legitimizing intervening in the internal affairs of
countries, to establishing an international institutional structure (or
order) that would maintain the superior position of the US at minimum
cost. The US withdrawing and abandoning countries to their own fates
would lead to a more deeply ingrained realist world.]{.underline} As one
would remember, during the presidency of [Trump]{.underline}, the US
[had built its grand strategy on the acceptance of the realist
world]{.underline} and acting in accordance with this new reality. It
had given up on the carrying out of military interventions in other
countries for regime changes or humanitarian purposes and the managing
of international politics through multilateral institutional structures.
And, this indicates the emergence of a world where states are left on
their own, uncertainty increases, and the use of force is legitimized
and widespread. The leadership of a single country in such a world is
beyond consideration. And, [the acceptance of a realist world would mean
that the US has given up on leading the world]{.underline}. Even before
he took office, [Biden had stated that the US would be "back in the
game", that is, he would follow a foreign policy in which the US would
once more assume the leadership role.]{.underline} He also carried on
with his statements and actions in this regard after taking office.
However, [he must have realized that this liberal foreign policy
perspective couldn't be sustained that he recently started to follow a
more realistic foreign policy, which also shows that Trump's foreign
policy decisions were not due to his own personal quirks but the
structural imperatives and conditions faced.]{.underline} His decision
to withdraw from Afghanistan should also be considered in this context.
In conclusion, many indicators show that the US is in an unstoppable
decline. This decline is, naturally, limited to the US losing its
current global leadership role. With its huge resources, geographical
advantage, and solid institutional structure, the US will continue to be
an important force in international politics. The biggest challenge of
the US in the medium and long term will be how quickly and how well it
adapts to its new position. Adapting to international politics without
the US will also be a significant challenge for other countries.

#### China overtaking the US in global leadership won't cause a great power war

**Paudel 20** -- Sirish; pursuing his Master's degree in International
Relations from SIPA, Jilin University; 9/3/20; "Decline in US Hegemony:
Will this Result in Hegemonic War or not?"; ModernDiplomacy;
https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2020/09/03/decline-in-us-hegemony-will-this-result-in-hegemonic-war-or-not/

One of the contemporary issues in international relations is that [the
current hegemon, the United States, has undergone a relative
decline]{.underline}. It is argued that [American hegemony that emerged
aftermath the Second World War is undergoing a decline and with the rise
of a potential challenger in China looming, one major issue concerning
IR scholars is whether or not the relative decline of US hegemony will
result in a hegemonic war. Hegemonic wars occur when a rising
challenger]{.underline} -- revisionist power -- [isn't content with the
current international order and wants to change it]{.underline} so as to
become a preponderant force and dictate terms of a new world order. This
article assumes that although the US is in a relative decline it is
still a dominant power and the rising power is content with the current
status quo so no war occurs between the dominant and the rising power.
In order to support the argument that a hegemonic war does not occur,
this article provides explanation using several theoretical
perspectives. To begin with, prominent neorealist Kenneth Waltz contends
that [the end of the Cold War has changed the structure of international
politics from bipolar to unipolar with the US being the dominant
power]{.underline}. According to Waltz, [days of US being unipolar force
in world politics is numbered and slowly the world is moving towards
bipolarity or multipolarity because changes in the structure of
international system brings about changes in state
behavior.]{.underline} It does not matter how much self-restraint and
self-control a preponderant power is in its conduct of international
relations; [states are always wary and fear the dominant power and thus
he maintains that balancing is universal]{.underline}. \[1\] In order to
explain why, he has resorted to the Balance of Power (theory). In most
basic sense, international politics is a state of anarchy where there is
no central government and states rely on themselves to protect their
autonomy and perpetuate their survival. [Balance of Power contends that
states involve in a balancing act to check the powers of preponderant
force so that no any single state has enough power to become a global
hegemon.]{.underline} \[2\] [With the relative decline of US, China and
America can enter into bipolar relationship]{.underline} much like the
US and the USSR during the Cold War. Since Waltz himself posits
bipolarity as the most stable of international configurations, it can be
argued that [act of balancing between the US and China brings the
international distribution of power into an equilibrium and averts the
risk of war.]{.underline} Socialization of Hegemonic Power Most scholars
posit that hegemons use threats and rewards to get compliance from
secondary states. Contrary to popular wisdom, scholars Ikenberry and
Kupchan have contended that in addition to material power, hegemons also
have the power of socialization to achieve compliance from secondary
states. They call this the socialization process which involves
'altering of the belief systems' of elites. Basically, [hegemons project
their vision of international order through normative principles (norms
and values) and not by material incentives; elites in secondary states
internalize them, and devise policies that are compatible to the
hegemon's ideal of the international order.]{.underline} The authors
contend that the world order thus created can sustain even when hegemon
undergoes a decline because the world order created is relatively
inexpensive to maintain in the sense that altering of states preferences
are by virtue of ideals rather than use of coercion. Thus, by virtue of
socialization of hegemonic power, relative changes in hegemon's
distribution of material power (military and economy) does not put
strain on the international system. So, on viewing the world from the
lens of socialization, it can be argued that the expansion of US
normative principles on liberal economic norm to its former allies and
enemies aftermath the second world war that led to the formation of the
current liberal economic world order provides an explanation as to why
in spite of US' relative decline there is continuity for America's
liberal economic order. \[3\] The rising challenger [China]{.underline}
can be considered to have been socialized -- it [has accepted US led
international norms, and participates in various International
Organizations]{.underline}. Thus, [it makes less sense for China to wage
war against the hegemon whose ideals it has internalized]{.underline}.
Hegemonic Stability Theory According to this theory, a hegemon creates a
stable international economic order characterized by market openness but
its decline results in global instability. This hegemonic effect of open
trade benefits all participants, especially, weaker states that do not
have any burden of public goods. In this sense, global economic
stability is born out of hegemony and provides provision of collective
public goods and in doing so facilitates a stable international system.
The motivation to create an economic openness lie in the interest of the
hegemon -- it has the largest economy and so benefits most from open
markets. In addition, only hegemons have the material capability
(political and military) to provide public goods and induce other states
to embrace open trade. \[4\] By virtue of the Hegemonic Stability
Theory, the hegemon is an important element in creation and maintenance
of the international system. As stated earlier, open trade benefits all
participants, even the rising challengers that are accommodated in the
system. In contemporary world politics, China is the fastest rising
power and it is also reaping the benefits of the open economic order
created by the US. [By participating in the globalized economy, China
has earned a comparative advantage in labor-market and its economy has
been growing.]{.underline} On top of that [China is an export-based
economy and thus, it has very little incentive to jeopardize this
benefit by engaging with the hegemon and thereby disrupting the
order.]{.underline} In his article, Artur Stein has argued that [decline
in hegemony does not bring about a complete collapse of the trade regime
as long as hegemonic power is committed to economic openness. Taking
these two points in consideration, it can be argued that it is not in
the interest of China to challenge US hegemony. On account, likelihood
of war is averted.]{.underline}

### Dissolution

#### The NATO Summit in Madrid is increasing US-China Tensions acting in the direct opposite of Europe's interest. The alternative is to create a global peace movement and to push for the dissolution of military alliances freeing up resources to solve climate change and poverty.

[From the perspective of Washington's drive to perpetuate its hegemony
over most of Europe and the Asia Pacific by portraying Russia and China
as enemies---a grand strategy that has been followed by all successive
post-1991 US administrations---the new escalation to be confirmed in
Madrid makes full sense.]{.underline} While resolutely supporting
Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion, President Biden has
multiplied provocative gestures toward Beijing, [including his
statement, prior to a summit meeting in May of the anti-China alliance
known as the Quad (Japan, Australia, and India along with the United
States), that the United States would defend Taiwan militarily. The
statement was quickly watered down by the State Department, which had in
May removed from a Taiwan Fact Sheet on its website the statement "we do
not support Taiwan independence" and reinstated it in June.]{.underline}
From the perspective of Europe and the Asia Pacific, acquiescing to this
de facto extension of NATO's role is equivalent to being herded like
Panurge's sheep toward throwing themselves into the sea[. [Antagonizing
China is not in Europe's interest]{.mark}, nor is it in the interest of
any of the states invited to the Madrid summit. Even if the European
governments believed that Russia has now irreversibly become a threat to
their security, [it would be utterly counterproductive for them to push
Beijing toward consolidating an alliance with
Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These developments bring the world closer
to a conflagration that could dwarf the ongoing war in
Ukraine]{.underline} and endanger the future of humankind. [[It is
urgent to rebuild a global peace movement opposed to all military
alliances, demanding their dissolution]{.underline}]{.mark}, a movement
opposed as well to the ongoing massive increases in military budgets. It
is high time to return to global disarmament under the aegis of the UN,
as foreseen in the UN Charter. This charter is the cornerstone of
international law whose role must be renewed against the ongoing drift
toward the law of the jungle[. [The huge]{.mark} and ever-growing
[amounts that are spent on armament]{.mark} and [destruction would
be]{.mark} wisely [reallocated to]{.mark} the only wars that are truly
in humanity's interest: [the wars against poverty and climate
change.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The ideal geography for growth is one with abundant natural resources,
transport infrastructure, and buffers from enemies. The ideal government
is one that is capable yet accountable, meaning that it is strong enough
to provide services and maintain order, but sufficiently divided to
prevent corruption and the violation of private property rights.
Finally, the ideal population is large, young, and
educated.]{.underline} After presenting the evidence linking these
factors to economic growth, I use indicators of each to assess the
future prospects of the eight most powerful countries: the United
States, China, Russia, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and
India. [I find that the United States has, by far, the best growth
fundamentals. Geographically, the United States is a natural economic
hub and military fortress. It has enormous stocks of natural resources,
more natural transport infrastructure than the rest of the world
combined, and is surrounded by "friends and fish" (Canada, Mexico, and
two huge oceans) whereas all the other major powers border powerful
rivals.]{.underline} Institutionally, the United States is so-so. The
small and divided U.S. government does a poor job redistributing wealth,
but it fosters entrepreneurship and innovation; spurs reform after
policy blunders; and helps the United States suck up investment,
technology, and human capital from other nations. Demographically[, the
United States has the most productive population]{.underline}, and [its
working-age population is set to grow during this century]{.underline},
[unlike the populations of its competitors.]{.underline} Potential
challengers each have several weaknesses. [China, the only country that
is anywhere close to challenging U.S. primacy, has especially dismal
growth prospects. In the coming decades, China will lose a third of its

Here to Stay"

[IS RETREAT from global hegemony in America's national interest? No idea
has percolated more widely over the past decade---and none is more
bogus. The United States is not headed for the skids and there is no
reason it should be. The truth is that America can and should seek to
remain the world's top dog. The idea of American hegemony is as old as
Benjamin Franklin, but has its practical roots in World War II. The
United States emerged from that war as the dominant economic, political
and technological power.]{.underline} The only major combatant to avoid
serious damage to its infrastructure, its housing stock or its
demographic profile, the United States ended the war with the greatest
naval order of battle ever seen in the history of the world. It became
the postwar home of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank. And, of course, the United States had the bomb.
America was, in every sense of the word, a hegemon. "Hegemony" is a word
used by social scientists to describe leadership within a system of
competing states. The Greek historian Thucydides used the term to
characterize the position of Athens in the Greek world in the middle of
the fifth century BC. Athens had the greatest fleet in the
Mediterranean; it was the home of Socrates and Plato, Sophocles and
Aeschylus; it crowned its central Acropolis with the solid-marble temple
to Athena known to history as the Parthenon. Athens had a powerful rival
in Sparta, but no one doubted that Athens was the hegemon of the time
until Sparta defeated it in a bitter twenty-seven-year war[. America's
only global rival in the twentieth century was the Soviet Union. The
Soviet Union never produced more than about half of America's total
national output. Its nominal allies in Eastern Europe were in fact
restive occupied countries, as were many of its constituent republics.
Its client states overseas were at best partners of convenience, and at
worst expensive drains on its limited resources. The Soviet Union had
the power to resist American hegemony, but not to displace
it.]{.underline} It had the bomb and an impressive space program, but
little else[. When the Soviet Union finally disintegrated in 1991,
American hegemony was complete. The United States sat at the top of the
international system, facing no serious rivals for global
leadership.]{.underline} This "unipolar moment" lasted a mere decade.
September 11, 2001, signaled the emergence of a new kind of threat to
global stability, and the ensuing rise of China and reemergence of
Russia put paid to the era of unchallenged American leadership. Now,
America's internal politics have deadlocked and the U.S. government
shrinks from playing the role of global policeman. In the second decade
of the twenty-first century, American hegemony is widely perceived to be
in terminal decline. Or so the story goes. In fact, reports of the
passing of U.S. hegemony are greatly exaggerated[. America's costly wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan were relatively minor affairs considered in
long-term perspective. The strategic challenge posed by China has also
been exaggerated. Together with its inner circle of unshakable
English-speaking allies, the United States possesses near-total control
of the world's seas, skies, airwaves and cyberspace, while American
universities, think tanks and journals dominate the world of
ideas.]{.underline} Put aside all the alarmist punditry. American
hegemony is now as firm as or firmer than it has ever been, and will
remain so for a long time to come. THE MASSIVE federal deficit, negative
credit-agency reports, repeated debt-ceiling crises and the 2013
government shutdown all created the impression that the U.S. government
is bankrupt, or close to it. The U.S. economy imports half a trillion
dollars a year more than it exports. Among the American population,
poverty rates are high and ordinary workers' wages have been stagnant
(in real terms) for decades. Washington seems to be paralyzed by
perpetual gridlock. On top of all this, strategic exhaustion after two
costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq has substantially degraded U.S.
military capabilities. Then, at the very moment the military needed to
regroup, rebuild and rearm, its budget was hit by sequestration. If
economic power forms the long-term foundation for political and military
power, it would seem that America is in terminal decline. [But policy
analysts tend to have short memories. Cycles of hegemony run in
centuries, not decades (or seasons). When the United Kingdom finally
defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, its national resources were
completely exhausted. Britain's public-debt-to-GDP ratio was over 250
percent, and early nineteenth-century governments lacked access to the
full range of fiscal and financial tools that are available today. Yet
the British Century was only just beginning. The Pax Britannica and the
elevation of Queen Victoria to become empress of India were just around
the corner. By comparison, America's current public-debt-to- GDP ratio
of less than 80 percent is relatively benign.]{.underline} Those with
even a limited historical memory may remember the day in January 2001
when the then chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, testified
to the Senate Budget Committee that "if current policies remain in
place, the total unified surplus will reach \$800 billion in fiscal year
2011. . . . The emerging key fiscal policy need is to address the
implications of maintaining surpluses." As the poet said, bliss was it
in that dawn to be alive! Two tax cuts, two wars and one financial
crisis later, America's budget deficit was roughly the size of the
projected surplus that so worried Greenspan[. This is not to argue that
the U.S. government should ramp up taxes and spending, but it does
illustrate the fact that it has enormous potential fiscal resources
available to it, should it choose to use them. Deficits come and go.
America's fiscal capacity in 2015 is stupendously greater than Great
Britain's was in 1815. Financially, there is every reason to think that
America's century lies in the future, not in the past. The same is true
of the supposed exhaustion of the U.S. military. On the one hand,
thirteen years of continuous warfare have reduced the readiness of many
U.S. combat units, particularly in the army. On the other hand, U.S.
troops are now far more experienced in actual combat than the forces of
any other major military in the world. In any future conflict, the
advantage given by this experience would likely outweigh any decline in
effectiveness due to deferred maintenance and training]{.underline}.
Constant deployment may place an unpleasant and unfair burden on U.S.
service personnel and their families, but it does not necessarily
diminish the capability of the U.S. military. On the contrary, it may
enhance it[. America's limited wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were hardly
the final throes of a passing hegemon.]{.underline} They are more akin
to Britain's bloody but relatively inconsequential conflicts in
Afghanistan and Crimea in the middle of the nineteenth century. Brutal
wars like these repeatedly punctured, but never burst, British hegemony.
In fact, Britain engaged in costly and sometimes disastrous conflicts
throughout the century-long Pax Britannica. British hegemony did not
come to an end until the country faced Germany head-on in World War I.
Even then, Britain ultimately prevailed (with American help). Its empire
reached its maximum extent not before World War I but immediately after,
in 1922. Ultimately, it is inevitable that in the long run American
power will weaken and American hegemony over the rest of the world will
fade. But how long is the long run? There are few factual indications
that American decline has begun---or that it will begin anytime soon.
Short-term fluctuations should not be extrapolated into long-term
trends. Without a doubt, 1991 was a moment of supreme U.S. superiority.
But so was 1946, after which came the Soviet bomb, Korea and Vietnam.
American hegemony has waxed and waned over the last seventy years, but
it has never been eclipsed. And it is unlikely that the eclipse is nigh.
WHEN PUNDITS scope out the imminent threats to U.S. hegemony, the one
country on their radar screens is China. While the former Soviet Union
never reached above 45 percent of U.S. total national income, the
Chinese economy may already have overtaken the American economy, and if
not it certainly will soon. If sheer economic size is the foundation of
political and military power[, China is positioned for future global
hegemony. Will it build on this foundation? Can it? Much depends on the
future of China's relationships with its neighbors. China lives in a
tough neighborhood. It faces major middle-tier powers on three sides:
Russia to the north, South Korea and Japan to the east, and Vietnam and
India to the south. To the west it faces a series of weak and failing
states, but that may be more of a burden than a blessing: China's own
western regions are also sites of persistent instability]{.underline}.
It is perhaps realistic to imagine China seeking to expand to the north
at the expense of Russia and Mongolia. Ethnic Russians are abandoning
Siberia and the Pacific coast in droves, and strategic areas along
Russia's border with China have been demographically and economically
overwhelmed by Chinese immigration. [Twenty-second-century Russia may
find it difficult to hold the Far East against China. But that is not a
serious threat to U.S. hegemony. If anything, increasing Sino-Russian
tensions may reinforce U.S. global hegemony, much as Sino-Soviet
tensions did in the 1970s.]{.underline}

#### China won't have the ability to counter US heg anytime soon

(https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/2870650/why-china-cannot-challenge-the-us-military-primacy/)

[People's Liberation Army (PLA) Major General Zhang Shaozhong ranked
Chinese military power in 2020 in the fifth place behind the United
States, Russia, Britain, and France, while PLAN surface power was ranked
in the eighth place behind Japan and India.]{.underline} The Peoples
Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) was ranked seventh in the world, due
to its lack of fourth-generation fighter planes and high-end drones.
[In]{.underline} [General Shaozhong's view, China will become the
second-largest military power in the world only in 2049]{.underline},
when it celebrates its centennial anniversary.27 The US Military as an
Economic Deterrent The US military plays the central role of economic
deterrence. [The Communist Party of China (CCP) gains its legitimacy
from economic development. It is possible that China could target Guam
with its small fleet of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM).
However, the use of ICBMs will lead to massive retaliatory strikes by
the United States leading to total annihilation of China's military and
economic centers of gravity]{.underline}.28 The USN Maritime Strike
Tomahawk Cruise Missile Block V will destroy coastal cities like
Shanghai, obliterating China's hi-tech industries in a matter of hours.
The CCP leadership is inexperienced in nuclear matters as it lacks
exposure to a nuclear warfare strategy as practiced by the United States
and Russia. [China's nuclear policy is based on low-level deterrence,
"minimum deterrence," and its nuclear arsenal remains small and
vulnerable]{.underline}.29 Threatening the United States with 200
nuclear weapons is not an option. Geographically, the United States and
China are similar in size. However, [China's economy will be decimated
by a few US nuclear weapons, as its critical infrastructure is
concentrated on the coastlines and not dispersed like the US
infrastructure]{.underline}. A war will lead to a loss of China's
exports to the United States worth USD 310 billion. The war will result
in a decline in industrial production, unemployment, and inflation,
causing an economic crash and a people's revolution. [As seen from World
War II, the United States will experience reverse economic gains and
benefit from the war, resulting in high employment and industrial
growth]{.underline}. It is expensive to be a superpower. Sun Tzu wrote
in The Art of War two and a half millennia ago, "first count the
cost."30 China's defense budget cannot compete with the combined power
of United States, India, Japan, and Australia. The United States alone
spends more on national defense than China, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia,
France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, and Brazil
combined.31 Can China afford it? An arms race will lead to an increase
in China's military spending, affecting its development goals. The
Absence of War-fighting Experience The United States has an analytical
learning process in place---China does not.32 Lessons learned have been
well documented by the US military in the form of doctrines, tactics,
techniques, and procedures. [The US military has been documenting
lessons learned since as early as the Boxer Revolution during the China
campaign]{.underline}.33 [The US military has been led by outstanding
military generals like George Marshall, Dwight Eisenhower, George
Patton, and David Petraeus, while China always lacked great
generals]{.underline}. The world sends its military officers to US
military institutions and not China's military colleges. The PLA
strategy is based on Mao's theory of the weak contender fighting a
stronger adversary through deceit and deception. [China's only option is
an asymmetric strategy due to its incapability to fight symmetric wars.
Chinese scholars have authored books like Science of Military Campaigns,
Science of Military Strategy, and Unrestricted Warfare.34 However, China
is unable to convert the strategies and tactics mentioned in these books
into an executable doctrine]{.underline}. The Lack of Power Projection
Power projection capabilities set a superpower apart. From its Charm
Offensive to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has been wielding
its economic power to compel US allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific
region to align with China, which has not been greatly successful.35
China lacks global reach, as it does not have foreign defense treaties
or logistical bases abroad equipped with military stockpiles.36 During a
war with the United States, soliciting Pakistan's military support looks
difficult, as China's all-weather friend has been hesitant to cut its
military ties with the United States. China is constrained to operate
beyond the unrefueled range of its aircraft, warships, and submarines.
[US nuclear-powered carriers can rule the seas for four years before
being refueled. China's nonnuclear-powered AC can barely operate beyond
its green waters]{.underline}. The Type 903 replenishment ship can only
support two to three ships for approximately two weeks.37 The USN's 68
nuclear-powered submarines have been prowling the world's oceans
displaying naval power, while the PLAN's nuclear-powered submarines are
unable to do so. Fighter aircraft operating without a package of
air-refueling tankers, Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft, or
a network of expeditionary airfields cannot travel very far. The PLAAF's
capability to target US bases in the Pacific is hindered by a lack of
air-refueling capacity. A flight group of eight J-11B Flankers will have
to be simultaneously refueled twice by two air-refueling tankers for a
seven-hour flight.38 The PLAAF will have to deploy 20 percent of its
tanker fleet to refuel the Flankers. The PLAAF has 10 tankers for more
than a thousand fighter aircraft, while the USAF has 625 tankers for
1,956 fighter aircraft.39 The tankers will be the prime targets for the
USN potentially putting the Flankers at risk. China's only existing
bomber, the H-6K, is reverse engineered from the 1950s Soviet-designed
Tu-16 bomber. The bomber is incapable of attacking Hawaii---even when
equipped with CJ-10 cruise missiles. The H-6K has a range of 3,800
miles, while Hawaii is 5,157 miles from the closest H-6K base. The H-6K
cannot attack nearby US bases, as the bomber will be detected on open
seas by the US C4ISR systems. PLAAF fighters are unable to escort the
bombers, as they cannot match its range.40 An Archaic Military [Less
than 30 percent of China's surface forces, air force, and air defense
forces and 55 percent of its submarine fleet were modern in 2011.41.
Subsequently, nothing much has changed, as a substantial percentage of
China's military remains obsolete]{.underline}.42 China's military faces
institutional shortcomings arising from obsolete command structures, low
quality of personnel, and corruption.43 The military has weaknesses
centering on supporting capabilities such as logistics, inadequate
airlift, and deficient air defense and antisubmarine warfare.44 The
PLA's loyalty to the CCP has hampered its competence.45 [China's
military training and operational capabilities and competences do not
match US standards]{.underline}.46 PLAAF pilots fall short on the
requirement of executing sophisticated aerial maneuvers during unplanned
operations.47 China's military structure presents significant cultural
challenges,48 as it emphasizes control above command.49 A culture of
risk aversion and low levels of trust in subordinates impacts the PLA
effectiveness.50 A highly centralized structure does not allow the PLAN
to operate autonomously during a war. Therefore, a political commissar
is positioned on PLAN warships and submarines.51 The USN values autonomy
from the individual to the institution, which reflects its emphasis on
commanding at sea.52 Nation states cannot project power globally through
a rigid command-and-control system.53 PLAN submarines have the worst
safety record in the world.54 The PLAN's rudimentary nuclear missile
submarine fleet carries a limited number of missiles.55 The PLAN cannot
threaten the US mainland, as its submarines will have to sail through
chokepoints such as the Kuriles and the Ryukyus islands, Luzon Strait,
Taiwan Strait, and the Philippine archipelago---all of which are
controlled by the USN.56 These chokepoints, forming a crescent-shaped
chain, are also a defensive line for US containment policy; and the
United States is involved in monitoring them. The PLAN submarine power
is outdated, compared to the overwhelming USN undersea warfare
capabilities. The US submarine arm brings strategic deterrence to the
Indo-Pacific through a wide array of capabilities such as antisubmarine
warfare antisurface warfare precision land strike; intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance; and special warfare capabilities.
Soviet weapon systems were much sought after by the United States to
learn their strengths and weaknesses. Numerous Soviet-made fighter
aircraft defected during the Cold War. An Iraqi MiG 21 defected to
Israel, while a Soviet MiG 25 landed in Japan. The aircraft were later
handed over to the United States to decipher the technical details.
However, US intelligence is not similarly orchestrating any defections
of PLAAF fighter aircraft, as the United States is not interested in
obsolete Chinese technology. Instead, China is stealing weapon data or
reverse engineering US weapon systems.57 The CCP-controlled military
press described the Shenyang J-15 Flying Shark fighter aircraft as a
"flopping fish" and criticized it for lacking the stealth capabilities
of the F-35 Lightning.58 The US F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter entered
service in 1983 and saw combat during the First Gulf War, while the
fifth-generation F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning fighter aircraft have
been deployed in conflict zones. However, the PLAAF has not
operationally inducted the J-31 fighter aircraft while the J-20 fighter
aircraft has not yet proven its capabilities in any bilateral or
multilateral military exercise. The much-hyped Chengdu J-20 is a heavy
fighter aircraft comparable to the MiG 31, which is essentially an
interceptor and not a multirole or an air superiority aircraft. [China's
Vulnerable A2/AD Zones A study of modern wars suggests that the United
States will decimate China's military without entering the A2/AD zone.
This is how the United States devastated Iraqi defenses in 1990. US
strategic depth in Asia will allow military planners to concentrate the
military at different locations. The United States has a devastating
array of lethal weapon systems, such as submarines, for countering
China's A2/AD strategies]{.underline}. During the First Gulf War, the
United States launched 297 Tomahawks, which destroyed the Iraqi
military.59 Ohio-class submarines can operate unhindered in the
adversary's A2/AD zone closer to the shore; thus, striking targets far
inland. Collectively, four Ohio-class submarines installed with 616
BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles would obliterate China's military. The
inexperienced PLAN AC group will be destroyed by long-range antiship
missiles (LRASM), Tomahawks, and Mark 48-Mod 7 torpedoes launched from
USS Key West, USS Oklahoma City, USS Topeka, and USS Asheville
submarines based in Guam. The USN and USAF have signed a USD 414 million
contract for autonomously guided with onboard sensors, jam-resistant,
and difficult to detect antiship LRASM.60 The stealthy Zumwalt-class
warship---equipped with emerging technologies---can sail undetected in
littoral waters and contested territories to launch LRASM and Tomahawk
cruise missiles. China is constructing military bases on islands in the
South China Sea; however, this military infrastructure is vulnerable to
US weapon systems, as the islands lack natural defenses and
camouflage.61 During a war, the bases will be annihilated by the USN as
the PLA cannot hide behind hills and forests. Once destroyed, these
facilities cannot be supported from the mainland, as the logistical
supplies will be demolished by the USN. China's military modernization
may enhance A2/AD zones, but it does not contribute to a blue-water,
sea-control capability.62 China's Hyped DF-21 Missile The antiship DF-21
missile, carried by colossal transporter erector launchers, has a range
of 1,400 miles. The missile regiments are based in the barren Gobi
Desert, which makes it an easy target for the US military. The DF-21 has
been tested on a stationary ship, but it has not yet been successfully
tested against a moving target.63 A system of systems is required to
track the AC,64 acquire the precise location, keep the missile locked on
the target, penetrate the carrier's multilayered defenses, and provide
mid-course updates as within one hour the ship will have moved 30 miles.
China does not know about the DF-21 performance against the US CSG
countermeasures.65 The United States and Russia have not yet developed a
missile equivalent to the DF-21. However, China lacks the C4ISR systems
to strike targets at that range. China does not release the missile
testing data, leading to many questions, including whether it can hit
moving targets. Does it have precision targeting technologies?66 Until
proven otherwise, the functionality of the missile is based on nothing
but circumstantial inference and speculation. Opium War: Then and
Now---Nothing Much Has Changed One can draw some historical parallels.
For example, similarities exist between the unprepared Qing military
during the Opium Wars and the contemporary PLA, which underestimates the
US military.67 The Opium Wars were fought between the obsolete Qing
military and an industrializing and a technologically advanced Britain,
which possessed the world's most-powerful navy.68 [The British consisted
of 20,000 troops and three dozen modern Royal Navy warships. While China
maintained an 800,000 strong military force, only 35 percent of these
forces were equipped with firearms.69 China had several A2/AD
advantages, including strategic depth, numerical advantage, familiarity
with battle terrain, and excellent coastal defenses.70 But, much like
today\'s PLA, the Qing troops lacked combat experience. In contrast, the
British troops were battle hardened and highly disciplined because of
their involvement in various wars in the Middle East and Asia.71 The
Qing's archaic military system made it difficult to deploy troops to
counter the mobile British forces.72 China's generals, such as Yi Shan
and Yang Fang, were incompetent in the pivotal Battle of Canton in 1841,
resulting in a defeat for China]{.underline}.73 The Opium Wars have
military parallels for the PLA. The wars led to the collapse of the Qing
dynasty and the decimation of China's military. The outcome of a
contemporary war with the United States will be nearly identical to the
political dimensions of the Opium Wars. The Tianjin Treaty of 1858,
imposed by foreign powers, devastated China. Russia did not intervene
but pressured China to cede a large part of its northeastern territory,
including Vladivostok.74 The consequences of the Opium Wars led to the
Boxer Rebellion in 1899. About 80 years later, the Japanese invasion of
1937 demonstrated how vulnerable and weak China was to external naval
powers.

### UQ -- Heg Sustainable -- East Asia

#### US hegemony is maintained in Asia through the United Nations Command

**Ban 20** -- Kil Joo, Ph. D in Political Science from Arizona State
University, "The two-for-one entity and a 'for whom' puzzle: UNC as both
a peace driver and the US hegemony keeper in Asia", 9/1/20, Asian
Journal of Political
Science,https://doi-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/10.1080/02185377.2020.1814364

Offensive realists believe that cooperation is really difficult in
international politics. Thus, [a hegemon might be necessary for
international stability]{.underline} from the perspective of hegemonic
stability theorists. By contrast, neoliberal institutionalists believe
that regimes make cooperation possible without a hegemon. Interestingly
enough, the UNC plays a bridging role in filling the gap between the two
groups of thought. [The UNC]{.underline} as a multinational entity
[provides the US]{.underline}, a hegemon, [with an opportunity to
cooperate with other actors.]{.underline} To put it another way, the UNC
has characteristics of both a hegemon and regime. The US-led UNC allows
cooperation to be more likely by multinational actors' compliance with
the regime rules, not by hegemony-led enforcement. The UNC's primary
task has been to make the Korean Peninsula stable by maintaining the
armistice and this will continue to be its mission in the future as
well. Simultaneously, [the UNC leaves the US as the greatest beneficiary
of its existence, in terms of hegemony maintenance]{.underline}. [The
UNC as an international entity gives the US political, military,
economic and institutional leverage]{.underline} over the other actors
on the Korean Peninsula. Political leverage is when one state makes
other states do what it wants and when it is able to command them. The
UNC offers a consolidated legitimacy to oversee the DMZ on the Korean
Peninsula (Salmon, 2019). [The UNC also provides the US with the
leverage to command the 16 Sending States who comprise the UNC because
only the US general is authorized to assume the responsibilities of the
UNC Commander (CDR). The CDR's position leaves the US as a dominant
voice in security and diplomatic arrangement in the region. The UNSCR 84
clearly establishes the UNC as 'a unified command under the United
States']{.underline} (The United Nations homepage). [No other states can
challenge the US's authorization unless the U.N. changes it. Although
the 16 states who comprise the UNC are able to express their opinion,
the only person in charge who makes a final decision is the US
general.]{.underline} Thus, the US's opinion, hierarchically, takes
priority over the others. Likewise, [although policies are developed and
decided under the name of the UNC, the US-preferred ones seem most
likely to be espoused.]{.underline} The liaison officers from the
sixteen Sending States play their role for peace on the Korean Peninsula
under the organization of the Multinational Coordination Center (MNCC).
They participate in the theater-level exercises with the CFC to
coordinate with the dispatch of military assets in the event of war.
Interestingly enough, the MNCC is with the U-3, the Assistant Chiefs of
Staff for Operations, of the UNC and it has been bolstered to work more
closely with the UNC since 2015 (Creamer, 2017, p. 19). Since the U-3 is
just one of the staffs of the UNC CDR, the US technically is presumed to
have an influence on them. Seen in this light, the US as the commander
is able to 'integrate international support' by effectively using a
legal international entity (Creamer, 2017, p. 25). The US as the UNC CDR
has the right to implement personnel management for other states. In
2018, the US designated a non-American general to assume the duties as
the UNC Deputy Commander (DCR) for the first time since 1950. On 30 July
2018, Canadian Lieutenant General Wayne D. Eyre took office as the UNC
DCDR as part of the effort to revitalize the UNC (Song, 2018, July 30).
Then in 2019, the US named Australian Vice Admiral Stuart Mayer as the
UNC DCDR to replace Lieutenant General Eyre (Yi, 2019). All of the
designations could be fully interpreted as the US exercising its
political clout to control the actions of member states of the UNC. [The
existence of the US-led UNC allows the US to play a leading role in
international meetings.]{.underline} On January 16, 2018, the US and
Canada co-hosted an international meeting for foreign ministers and
representatives of 20 countries in Vancouver (US Embassy & Consulate in
Korea Homepage). This meeting was officially billed as the 'Vancouver
Foreign Ministers' Meeting on Security and Stability on the Korean
Peninsula' aimed at dealing with North Korea's denuclearization. All of
the foreign ministers except for India's were affiliated with the UNC
(Creamer, 2017, p. 21). Two insights stand out from this meeting. First,
[the very existence of the UNC allowed this ministerial-level diplomatic
meeting to be made. Thus, this meeting showed how influential the UNC as
an international entity is to the world]{.underline}. Second, since the
US takes a leading position in the UNC, the US looked eligible for this
meeting as a co-host. In this vein, [the UNC helped the US hegemony be
viewed as a benevolent one]{.underline}. Similarly, the UNC entitles the
US general to convene multinational meetings in South Korea. The most
viable example is the Ambassador Roundtable. The US four-star general in
the name of the UNC CDR calls monthly meetings by inviting ambassadors
from the 16 UNC member states plus some states invited by the UNC
commander. Two generals from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission
(NNSC) countries are also invited and key staff members attend the
meeting. The Ambassador Roundtable clearly shows how influential the US
hegemony is in the region using the tool of the UNC. The US general as a
host is seated in the centre with ambassadors seated around him. The UNC
CDR makes opening statements and then gives them his thoughts about
military situations and diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula. The
ambassadors from member and invited states are eager to listen to him
because the US general as the UNC CDR has significant power and
responsibility. At the end of the meeting, the UNC CDR again as a host,
makes closing remarks. There is no other place in the world that a
military general is able to invite high ranking diplomats and convene
this kind of meeting. A meeting arrangement seems closer to
military--civil relations on an international level, not civil--military
relations. In a nutshell, this kind of meeting itself based on the
regime of the UNC makes the US wield wider political clout to all member
states and the NNSC countries. The NNSC is technically an independent
organization from the UNC.1 Since both organizations are aimed at
maintaining the Korean Armistice, however, they work together in many
ways. For instance, the NNSC team also joins in the UNCMAC-led SIT.
Furthermore, the UNC CDR hosts the Change of Responsibility ceremonies
for NNSC members. On 30 May 2019, the UNC CDR, the US General Abrams
hosted the ceremony for incoming NNSC Swedish Member, Major General
Corneliusson at the US base, Camp Humphreys (dvids, 2019). This is a
clear example showing how close these two organizations are to each
other, meaning the US has political clout over NNSC countries as well,
namely Sweden and Switzerland. Inherently, the UNC is a multinational
entity and thus all affiliated states together manage the regime.
However, there exists a hierarchy in this organization because the US is
exclusively able to take the command position. Thus, although the UNC,
not the US, authorizes the DMZ access of certain personnel, the most
influential player within this organization is the US, which alone
decides who is allowed to enter into DMZ. The DMZ belongs to South
Korea's territory. South Korea, however, does not have the right to
authorize the DMZ access although the UNC does. Meanwhile, as more
people want to enter into the DMZ, the US's influence becomes greater.
The DMZ has been at the core of the talks toward North Korea's
denuclearization, particularly in 2018 and 2019. As a result, a number
of people outside of the Korean Peninsula rushed to join the DMZ tour.
Although there is a regulation on who is eligible to gain access, it
cannot provide guidance for all situations. Thus, somebody needs to
decide whether they are allowed to enter into the DMZ or not. Since the
US general takes command of the UNC and US personnel to take the key
positions, the US enjoys privileges to decide who is permitted. In June
2019, Seoul invited Germany's governmental officials to learn lessons
from their unification process JTBC News (2019, September 17)., South
Korea's news outlet, reported that the UNC did not authorize their
access to the DMZ for safety reasons. The fact that one state has
exclusive rights to give permission to access the area, particularly at
the centre of political gravity, under the pretext of the
internationally recognized regime, could be sufficiently interpreted as
that it is armed with political leverage. By the same token, an
initiative proposed even by a host nation would be impossible without
the UNC's authorization in a situation where the proposal is related to
its area of responsibility. In September 2019, Seoul laid out the
initiative to transform the DMZ into an 'international peace zone',
which has been announced for the first time at the UN (UN News, 2019).
International support matters to make this initiative work. Thus, Seoul
posted a six minutes promotional video on the DMZ peace zone initiative
on the Blue House's YouTube channel aimed at securing 'the support of
the international society' (Yonhap News, 2019, November 6). Similarly,
the UNC has once again been at the core as the key player who makes the
initiative possible because the DMZ is under the UNC's control. [The UNC
has full authority over the highly regarded geopolitical areas such as
the DMZ.]{.underline} Thus, inter-Korean or multinational activities
crossing the territorial border are not feasible politically as well as
diplomatically without the UNC's coordination. On 3 October 2019, when
peace-seeking efforts were growing, the UNC Commander, General Robert
Abrams, stressed that 'while \[the two Koreas\] may continue the
dialogue, all of that would have to be brokered, adjudicated, observed
and enforced by UN Command' (2018, October 3). The UNC's full control of
these areas renders the US's political and diplomatic leverage
influential. As North Korea's denuclearization has become the central
focus in the world as well as on the Korean Peninsula, the UNC's roles
and responsibilities are taken as important as well. Thus, the UNC's
political leverage has become more influential, contributing to
strengthening the prestige of the US as a hegemon in the region. The DMZ
is not simply a military area but has become a political domain. In this
political domain on the border, [the US remains the most influential
political actor mainly thanks to the existence of the UNC. The US's
political clout benefitted by the UNC cannot be easily transferrable to
the one to its growing hegemonic rival, China.]{.underline} The UNC is
basically a military organization, not a governmental one and thus in
some sense, [the US enjoys military leverages and utilities greater than
other states. Although the UNC]{.underline}, technically as well as
legally, [is a multinational military organization, it does not take any
directive from the international body. Rather, just one actor, the US,
gives directives to the UNC through the US Joint Chiefs of
Staff]{.underline} (JCS).2 The document on the history of the unified
command, published by the US JCS, shows that the UNC belongs to one of
its commands (The US JCS, 2013, pp. 15--16). The military is
hierarchical culturally as well as structurally. Thus, who can give
directives determines everything from the priority of current tasks to
the future policy design. In this respect, [the US military in
Washington certainly has massive leverage over the UNC]{.underline}, an
internationally driven legal entity, which functions as the influential
military command on the Korean Peninsula. The UNC has had an influence
over military operations or exercises on the Korean Peninsula where
South Korea, a host nation, sixteen Sending States and NNSC countries
participate directly or indirectly. Historically, the UNC used to have a
full OPCON from 1950 to 1978. During this period, the UNC served as the
warfighting command at a theater-level of operation as well as peacetime
management. In 1978, its OPCON was transferred to the CFC but [the UNC
is still honoured as a vital command]{.underline} which used to defeat
the communists. The US-led UNC's military contribution is embedded in
the history of the Korean War, which helps the US keep its hegemonic
authority. The US four-star general, acting as the UNC CDR, hosts the
Armistice Agreement Commemoration Ceremony on July 27 every year. In
these ceremonies, the achievements by the UNC and soldiers' sacrifices
are commemorated. In this area, the US serves as a hegemonic spiritual
leader thanks to the US command position. Currently, the UNC has no
function of warfighting command. It still has a powerful function of
peace command, though. In some sense, the UNC's peace management
authority is more influential because the Korean Peninsula does not
remain at war most of the time. A full-scale war has not broken out
since the end of the Korean War. The UNC plays a key role in
investigating incidents that occur in the DMZ or around five islands at
the Yellow Sea. When an incident occurs in its area of responsibility,
the UNCMAC under the UNC dispatch the SIT to investigate whether they
violated the Korean Armistice Agreement. The 'armistice spirit' also is
a key ruler at the investigation and thus the scope of the SIT's
activity could be wider simply beyond the DMZ. Most of the time,
military personnel are the main people who are investigated, but even
civilians are often investigated too. When a wildfire happens within the
DMZ, a civilian firefighting helicopter enters into the DMZ under the
UNC's permission. If a pilot accidentally crosses the MDL, the SIT
investigates him. The UNC also intervenes in handling arms control of
two Korean forces in the DMZ areas as shown in the JSA demilitarization
in 2018 (Chung, 2019, pp. 484--485). Moreover, the UNC enjoys a certain
tool to engage in the ROK-US military exercises and training through the
NNSC. The UNC tasks the NNSC to observe them in its efforts to assess
their nature over whether they are deterrent and defensive. Exercise
scenarios and key staff ideas are important matters that the NNSC
observes. After various observations, including major component
commands, the NNSC produces its report and two generals of the NNSC
deliver it to the UNC CDR. The fact that one country-led entity can ask
other countries to observe the exercises of a certain alliance is
evidence that it exercises military leverage over other countries. [The
UNC allows foreign bases to be expanded into Japan which makes its
military missions more achievable]{.underline}. Japan is not a member
state of the UNC but ironically the UNC Rear is located in Japan, which
includes eight states (Graham, 2017). There is no international legal
basis for the UNC Rear. Instead, the US concluded a mutual agreement
with Japan and thus in 1957, the UNC Rear was established in Japan for
the UNC's military use. Those seven bases play a bridging role in
receiving military assets from the Sending States aimed at providing
them with the UNC at war. If the UNC is dissolved, the UNC Rear will be
dismantled, which would not be helpful for maintaining the US's
influence in the region. Likewise, the UNC serves as a key entity to
coordinate military assets from the Sending States. [Without the UNC,
the US finds it hard to ask for help from other states in times of
crisis]{.underline} on the Korean Peninsula. [The existence of the UNC
makes coordination with the Sending States work autonomously. Thus, the
US military's mission success seems more likely under the existence of
the UNC.]{.underline} Inherently, its influence over the UNC is aimed at
making the Korean Peninsula stable. However, the US's daily cooperation
with member states makes them more likely to be on its side if it is
confronted with a revisionist China. The UNC CDR produces an Annual
Report at the end of every year and sends it to the UN according to
UNSCR 84. Since the UNC CDR is inherently the US general, the US JCS has
an influence over them. Annual reports state what the UNC has done for
the year and the UNC CDR's thoughts for evaluation. They make the UNC's
military mission to be recognized as important as well as fully legal by
the international audience. To put it another way, the US's hegemony is
taken as benevolent through the well-functioned UNC from the military
point of view as well. The UNC is basically a military organization and
thus it has less economic influence than political or military. However,
there is some role to play for economic leverage and utilities by the US
The budget connection allows affiliated states to regard the US as a
benevolent hegemon and thus encourage them to comply with the US-led
order. The United States Forces Korea (USFK) deals with a military
budget for all American soldiers who work under the CFC and the UNC.
South Korea also contributes to its service through the defense
cost-sharing process by the Special Measures Agreement (SMA). The NNSC's
budget connection with the US encourages US policies to be adopted.
Despite the independent nature of the NNSC, the US military provides
them with a variety of financial assistance from base facilities to
transportation, service workers on camp and even drivers. The Korean
Armistice Agreement states the UNC's obligation to offer them (The
Korean Armistice Agreement, 1953, p. 13). The NNSC camp, which belongs
to South Korea's territory and is located in the JSA, is practically not
their base. The camp is located on an American base. Accordingly, the
Directorate of Public Works (DPW) of the US Army takes care of
facilities, electricity and painting on the camp. No American soldiers
live on the camp but the US is in charge of the base for the NNSC
personnel, leaving the one as an extremely rare case. Whenever an actor
is financially supported by another, the former becomes reliant on the
latter. Seen in this light, the US exercises economic leverage over the
NNSC. Similarly, [the US provides military personnel of the Sending
States who work in the UNC with financial assistance, such as military
quarters or houses. Thus, in some sense economic leverage makes the US's
bond with the Sending States stronger. The existence of the UNC makes
the connection possible, contributing to the US hegemony's maintenance
at the end of the day.]{.underline} Furthermore, Washington in the Trump
era tends to see alliances from the viewpoint of economic interest. In a
situation where [the UNC has increased its political and military
leverage by a window of opportunity from denuclearization and peace
posture]{.underline}, the US's support or assistance has become more
vital. [The increased political and military leverage seems to promote
the US to be armed with economic leverage as well.]{.underline}
Washington has pushed Seoul to pay much more for South Korea's defense
since 2018 and is expected to continue to do (Kim, 2019). In particular,
the US reportedly demanded more than five times at the negotiation in
2019 to South Korea regarding defense cost-sharing, which clearly shows
the impacts of its security role on economic clout (Lee, Cha, and Shin
2019). Although political, military and economic leverage is inherently
rooted in the internationally given legal institution of the UNC, the
UNC itself possesses institutionally driven leverage that it can use to
make other actors follow the US's directions or requests without strong
opposition. The logic is in the works because of its inherently given
institutional justification. The UNC was the first organization which
was established under the logic of collective security. That rare
institutional setting tends to encourage the UNC to continue to be
recognized as valuable. [Maintenance of a hegemony requires soft power
as well as hard power. The UNC was given legally by the international
entity, the UNSC although the US had an influential role to make it.
Then the US-led UNC is taken as a peace promoter, not warmonger thanks
to its unique roles. Thus, the US's activities by the UNC's mission seem
to increase its softer power in the region.]{.underline} The US's
attempt to build institutional leverage by the UNC had already begun in
the time of its establishment in 1950. Who gave its name: the UN or the
UNSC? Neither did. The UNSC just mentioned 'a unified command'. The US,
though, called this unified command 'the United Nations Command'. The
organization's name thus creates the illusion for international
audiences that the UN is in charge of the UNC. However, it is far from
the truth. In 1995, then-UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali made
it clear that the UNC has nothing to do with the UN (Ahn, 2019). In the
meantime, its name has officially been used since 1950 without
resistance. As such, it has institutionally been acknowledged by
international audiences as time went by. The fact that the words of 'the
United Nations' is included in its name makes international audiences
misunderstand that the UNC's activities are being made exclusively for
the world. [The name-led institutionalization has clearly been a great
success from the US's viewpoint in the sense that it has made
international audiences think of the US-led organization as a purely
multination one and that the US is not acting alone. This helps sustain
the perception of that of the US is a benevolent hegemony power. The
longer regimes exist, the stronger they become.]{.underline} This logic
could be referred to as institutional inertia. [The UNC has functioned
without any cessation ever since 1950]{.underline}, which serves as a
very rare case from the viewpoint of the durability as well as its
origin. In principle, there is no single player who deals with the UNC's
mission. Thus, its decisions are not taken as unilateral. In reality,
since only US generals assume the command position, the UNC's decisions
seem likely to be heavily preferable to the US's interests. Although the
UNC stands firm institutionally, the UNC CDR still attempts to remind
others of the strong legal ground by annually hosting Armistice
Agreement Commemorative Ceremony. Considering a number of tasks, the UNC
has only a small staff dispatched from member states, which consists of
30 key staffs officers in addition to the UNCMAC Secretariat personnel.
In this regard, the UNC could be the most cost-effective organization of
all militaries in the world. How is this possible? The prestigious
nature of the UNC as an institutionally firm regime makes up for its
limited personnel, which makes the Sending States, the NNSC and Japan
contribute to the missions more. In summary, the UNC's institutionally
driven leverage creates the perception of the US as a benevolent hegemon
in East Asia, a position in which it rarely finds itself in other
regions of the world. [The US increases its influence over the
Asia-Pacific region through the UNC]{.underline}'s security management
of the Korean peninsula. Thus, the [UNC serves as a 'the two-for-one
entity' for promoting US interests.]{.underline} From the US's
perspective, 'killing two birds with one stone' is the biggest prize
from the existence of the UNC. However, this 'two-for-one' perspective
is not likely accepted by the other members of the UNC, who may focus on
its primary mission only, that of maintaining the armistice.
Accordingly, a 'for whom' question could be seriously raised internally
as well as externally.

#### US hegemony will continue in response to China's Rise

noted that [[the intensifying US-China competition is not a period of
power transition but a continuation of the American unipolar
era]{.underline}]{.mark} (pp. 3--4). [[The sustainability of the US is
explained by its relative advantages over its
competitors.]{.underline}]{.mark} These include: (1) its [[superior
material indicators compared to its competitors, including
China]{.underline}]{.mark}, which weakens external constraints on
America's comprehensive power; (2) it[[s strong ability to shape global
affairs; and (3) its geographical and demographic advantages over its
competitors]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Beckley, [2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09512748.2022.2075441),
p. 2; Brooks &
Wohlforth, [2008](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09512748.2022.2075441), [2016](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09512748.2022.2075441);

28--37). While these factors correctly explain the sustainability of US
hegemony at the global level, their applicability at the regional level,
especially in Northeast Asia, is less clear. This is due to China's
asymmetric military strategy and geography-based advantages -- factors
that have the potential to weaken America's regional strategic edge.
Nevertheless, [this article shows that the [US hegemony is durable and
remains a critical source of peace and stability in Northeast
Asia]{.mark}]{.underline} but in a 'renegotiated'
arrangement.[^[4]{.underline}^](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09512748.2022.2075441#EN0004) This
is not only because of America's extant relative strategic and economic
advantages over China, as argued by the unipolarity scholars, but also
due to two other factors -- the proactive effort by its regional allies
to preserve US hegemony and China's problems in building an alternative
regional order.

#### Allied support and China's weaknesses keep the U.S on top

**Singh 22**\[Bhubhindar, 18 May, S. Rajaratnam School of International
Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore,
<https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09512748.2022.2075441,BK>\]

[[There are two other factors that support the preservation of US
hegemony in the coming decades]{.underline}]{.mark}, but have received
little attention in the unipolarity literature. [[First, the durability
of the US hegemony is secured by an expanded support from its regional
allies in the post-2010 period]{.underline}]{.mark}. Though the American
hegemony is expected to remain strong, its authority, as argued by
Ikenberry
([2011](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09512748.2022.2075441)),
has experienced relative weakening due to China's growing political,
military and economic power and impact on regional affairs. [[The
'renegotiated' outcome, as argued here, will not see a decline in
American hegemony, as the US allies have boosted efforts to preserve
American hegemony in the region.]{.underline}]{.mark} Though these
states are unable to influence the outcome of the regional balance of
power, [[US allies, nevertheless, are stakeholders who shape the
regional dynamics in critical ways.]{.underline}]{.mark} The regional
states, especially US allies, have pursued more activist foreign policy
strategies in support of the strong American military presence in the
region and maintain a resilient US hegemony (see Singh et
al., [2019](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09512748.2022.2075441),
pp. 29--31). For instance, the emergence of the 'free and open
Indo-Pacific' (FOIP) promoted by Japan is a way to keep the US engaged
in the region and counter Chinese attempts at regional dominance (MOFA &
Japan, [2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09512748.2022.2075441)).
FOIP is aligned with the liberal internationalism's organizing
principles that include the promotion of economic interdependence,
strengthened institutionalism and a rules-based order. Moreover, when
the US withdrew from the TPP in 2017, Japan took the lead to garner
support from the remaining 11 countries that led to the eventual signing
of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific
Partnership (CPTPP). [[Second, the durability of the US-led regional
order is also a result of the weaknesses related to China's attempts to
install its own alternative order]{.underline}]{.mark} (see Kai He's
paper in this special issue). [[China has faced resistance in its
order-building attempts beyond the economic realm -- externally from
America's overwhelming power and its regional allies, and internally
from its own domestic challenges, such as maintaining sustainable and
equitable growth across the country, aging population, environmental
issues and others.]{.underline}]{.mark} As opposed to the US during the
early postwar period, [[China does not have sufficient strategic
resources and goodwill to support its order-building
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} beyond the economic domain. [[Any ambitious
attempt to pursue order-building in political and strategic domains has
been viewed in suspicious terms and countered by Northeast Asian
states.]{.underline}]{.mark} A good example is how Japan countered
China's attempt to impose a narrow conception of 'East Asia' (made up of
ASEAN, China, Japan and South Korea) on the East Asian multilateral
process. With support from selected ASEAN states, Japan pushed for the
incorporation of other dialogue partners, such as Australia, New Zealand
and India as core members of the East Asian community and the ASEAN-led
multilateral order (Terada, 2010). Suspicions from the regional states
in response to Beijing's increasingly hard-line foreign policy strategy
(as seen in its tough diplomatic approach towards Hong Kong and Taiwan,
its assertive policy towards its territorial disputes with Japan and
several Southeast Asian states, as well as its economic coercive
policies towards Australia and South Korea) have further hardened, (see
Choe, 2021; The Economist, 2022).

What is curious about this volume, like so many on globalization, are
the questions it does not address. There is no serious discussion, for
example, of the security requirements of globalization. [If the United
States did not police globalization]{.underline} today, [who
would]{.underline}? It is true that hegemony is not the only peaceful
configuration of power in history. The European Union, a community of
relatively equal powers, is a current example. But [Germany and France
did not cooperate after World War II to end centuries of internecine
European conflict without the presence of the US security
umbrella]{.underline}. To expect China and Japan to cooperate in the
absence of a continuing US security role in Asia assumes a lot and
requires at least some careful exploration. In addition, except for the
contribution by Bajpai and Sahni, the volume is silent on the debate
going on inside other countries about how those countries would run the
world if the United States were weaker. [The focus is entirely on US
dominion which is strongly criticized. But why is there the implicit
expectation that European, Chinese, Japanese, Brazilian or Indian
foreign policy, which according to the volume should benefit from the
new \"bargaining chips\" provided by globalization, would do much
better? It\'s natural for non-Americans to be more optimistic about
their contributions to global peace and prosperity, just as Americans
may be about their contributions. But non-Americans have to make the
case, just as they find fault with the case made by Americans. If
American leadership has been so deficient, how did the Cold War end
without a hot war and how has the world enjoyed unprecedented prosperity
since the Cold War ended?]{.underline} The volume seems completely
oblivious to the fact that this latest \"outburst\" of capitalism has
raised the standard of living of more people living under the poverty
line than ever before. [China and India, with most of the world\'s
poorest population, are growing three and four times faster than Europe,
Japan and America, and have been for 20 years or more. Would this have
happened under Soviet (if Moscow had won the Cold War), European,
Chinese, Indian or Japanese hegemony or consortium? Would these
countries have championed freer trade policies for East Asian and now
Chinese, Indian and Latin American exporters, or sympathized with the
promotion of human rights in places such as Sudan and Zimbabwe, where
Russian and Chinese policies currently block international efforts to
stop humanitarian atrocities? The criticism of America is not the
problem. A dominant power is fair game. But the criticism also
ironically takes for granted the benefits of American hegemony, the open
markets and global security provided by US foreign policy, the
flexibility of America\'s middle classes, which have transitioned to
better jobs in America so that more jobs could be created in poorer
countries]{.underline}, and the light footprint of American imperialism
that since 1945 has nurtured not colonies but democratic
self-governments in Europe, Asia and elsewhere. [Admittedly, America\'s
soft power is under a cloud, but]{.underline} the relevant question is,
[compared to what]{.underline}. Some, if not [much, of the opposition to
America has little to do with America. It has to do with authoritarian
ideologies in other countries]{.underline}, particularly in Asia and the
Middle East, [that prefer elitist over middle-class economies and
nationalist over liberal political ideologies.]{.underline}

### A2: China Rise

#### China will not achieve regional hegemony---lack of political allies in the Indo-Pacific region

**Roy 20** -- Denny; Ph.D. in political science, University of Chicago,
1991) writes mainly on Northeast Asian international security issues;
"China won't achieve regional hegemony"; 19 Mar 2020, , The Washington
Quarterly, 43:1, 101-117, DOI: 10.1080/0163660X.2020.1734301

[The recent rise of China has been undeniably impressive, prompting many
observers to conclude it is destined to achieve hegemony, or the ability
to compel the other governments in the region to conform to China's
preferences on political and strategic issues as well as to prevent or
roll back any major strategic re-adjustment that China chooses to
oppose.]{.underline} Some argue that the United States should accept
what appears to be inevitable and get out of China's way by yielding up
America's own postwar position of strategic preeminence in the
Indo-Pacific.1 [But attaining major power status, even to the point of
rivaling the United States in economic and military influence, does not
make China a hegemon or guarantee that China will continue to ascend
until it dominates the region.]{.underline} Discussions of an impending
Chinese hegemony in the Indo-Pacific are instead based on the relative
growth of China's economic clout and military power. Superficial
material capabilities, however, do not tell the whole story. If the
United States maintains its present level of commitment to Indo-Pacific
leadership, Beijing will be unable to establish a Chinese hegemony over
the region, although a burgeoning China will be able to reduce US
freedom of action. And [even if the United States decided to withdraw
from its military bases and alliances, China would probably be unable to
comprehensively impose its will on the region through military
force.]{.underline} China's potential to dominate is restrained by a
combination of both domestic and international factors. Beijing's own
frequently stated position is [that "China will never seek hegemony,
expansion or \[a\] sphere of influence"]{.underline}2---however, this
position lacks credibility. [China has for decades criticized the United
States for its military bases and alliances in the western Pacific as
well as for policies that allegedly worsen geopolitical
tensions.]{.underline}3 The CCP has defined China's vital
interests---i.e., the issues over which the Chinese would see themselves
as defending rather than aggressing---so expansively that fulfilling
them all would constitute a Chinese regional hegemony in practical
terms. The list includes demands that Taiwan must become a province of
the PRC; that the international community recognize China as owner of
the Japan-administered Senkaku islands as well as most of the East and
South China Seas; that Beijing has the right to veto selected South
Korean defense policies (e.g., the THAAD missile defense controversy of
2016--17); that the Japanese government must "not make a fuss about" and
cease surveillance of PLA ships or aircraft patrolling the Japanese
coastline;4 and that foreign entities must conform to the
Beijing-approved interpretation of myriad important political questions
involving China. In effect, then, the collection of what Beijing
identifies as vital interests equates to a Chinese regional sphere of
influence---a buffer zone around its territory within which Beijing
would have veto power over the activities of foreigners. [It is evident
that China does indeed seek the preeminent regional role now held by the
United States.5 The question, however, is whether China can feasibly
attain these ambitions. What Beijing identifies as vital interests
equates to a Chinese regional sphere of influence.]{.underline} The
Legacy of Benign [**Hegemony China will not achieve regional dominance
for several reasons**. The first is that most of the Indo-Pacific
countries will resist, rather than facilitate, a change in regional
leadership. Some hegemonies are more popular than others.]{.underline}
Historically, a hegemon establishes a regional order---arrangements,
rules, and norms of international relations---that suits its own
interests.6 The willingness of the dominant power to accommodate the
preferences of other states in the region can vary. [The United States
has been a relatively benevolent hegemon. On two occasions when member
states tried to extricate themselves from the Soviet order in Eastern
Europe, for example---Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in
1968---Moscow intervened to quash these movements with military force.
By contrast, the US military withdrew from two valuable bases in the
Philippines in 1992 when the Philippine government refused to extend
their leases.]{.underline} Support among regional middle and smaller
powers for American preeminence is relatively high because many of these
states see their economic and security interests well-served by the
US-sponsored order's openness and liberal values.7 Conversely, [many
regional countries have historically-based fears of Chinese domination.8
Vietnam, for example, has suffered a total of nearly a thousand years of
Chinese occupation and cultural imperialism during its
history]{.underline}. Recent actions such as China's claim to own nearly
the entire South China Sea in contravention of the UN Law of the Sea
Treaty (which Beijing itself has signed) revive regional fears of
recrudescent Chinese imperialism. China's position as the main trading
partner for regional states seemingly offers Beijing the prospect of
gaining hegemony on the cheap---by leveraging the economic dependence of
its neighbors, Beijing could get other governments to accept Chinese
leadership on regional political and strategic issues and even to cede
some of their autonomy to China. In recent years, Beijing has
successfully used its economic weight to wrest concessions with
political implications from large corporations and universities in many
countries, including the United States.9 In Cambodia, Laos, and the
Philippines under the Duterte administration, PRC economic power appears
to have induced policies supporting Beijing's regional agenda.10 As much
as Beijing would wish otherwise, however, China's economic influence
over Indo-Pacific states generally does not equate to a corresponding
amount of political influence, nor does it automatically result in
states siding with the PRC. Although China is the top trade partner for
Australia and South Korea and is the top supplier of imports into Japan,
all three countries remain US treaty allies that host US military
forces. Australian Defense Minister Linda Reynolds recently expressed a
commitment to work more closely with "nations that share our values"
against "countries prepared to flout the rules-based order."11 China is
also the largest trading partner of Indonesia and Singapore. After years
of trying to stay out of the South China Sea territorial dispute,
Jakarta's policy has recently taken a hard turn against China's
position: renaming a portion of China's claim the North Natuna Sea,
destroying trespassing Chinese fishing boats, and beefing up Indonesian
military forces based on Great Natuna Island. [While China often
criticizes the US military presence in the region, Singapore is so
supportive that it built a pier at its Changi Naval Base to accommodate
visiting US aircraft carriers]{.underline}. Recently, the Indo-Pacific
region has seen a backlash against perceived Chinese attempts to exploit
business and trade relationships for political purposes. Canberra sided
with Washington to bar Chinese corporation Huawei from providing
undersea internet cables for Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.
Upon his return to power in 2018, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad reviewed his country's economic relationship with China, warning
of "new colonialism" that "has the effect of diminishing the freedom of
action of other countries."12

#### China does not have sufficient military power to Impose Hegemony

**Roy 20** -- Denny; Ph.D. in political science, University of Chicago,
1991) writes mainly on Northeast Asian international security issues;
"China won't achieve regional hegemony"; 19 Mar 2020, , The Washington
Quarterly, 43:1, 101-117, DOI: 10.1080/0163660X.2020.1734301

Insufficient Military Power to Impose Hegemony [If China cannot buy
political fealty, the alternative---imposing hegemony upon an unwilling
Indo-Pacific---would be immensely difficult and expensive. China lacks
the military strength to capture hegemony by force]{.underline}.
Unquestionably, China's military buildup and modernization have advanced
during the past two decades from a badly outclassed potential
conventional US opponent to one that might successfully frustrate US
military operations in some scenarios. The Chinese military could seize
and hold a disputed South China Sea island from one of the rival
claimants, for example, and could threaten serious damage against US
forces entering the theater the protect a friendly country. China has
the advantages of geographic proximity to likely conflict sites and
proficiency in missile technology, both especially useful for the task
of warding off an attempt by the United States to surge forces into the
region. [Nevertheless, the US military is still the world's most capable
across the full spectrum of combat and logistical capabilities.13 China
also has significant military disadvantages. First, over half of China's
official defense spending goes toward internal security, mostly in
restive areas such as Tibet and Xinjiang.14 Second, China probably
cannot leapfrog its way to technological parity with the US military.
The increased complexity of military technology has made it harder for
competitors to free-ride on research and development and to simply copy
leading-edge weapons systems. Despite the opportunities presented by
economic globalization and even with China's massive state-sponsored
efforts to steal advanced technology, the Chinese continue to fall short
of the standard-bearers in some kinds of weapons systems such as
submarines and advanced fighter aircraft.]{.underline}15 Finally, the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) suffers a dramatic deficit in combat
experience relative to the US military. US forces have fought overseas
every decade since the beginning of the Cold War, including continuous
large-scale military operations in the Middle East for nearly two
decades. The US armed forces consequently have deep reservoirs of
experienced warfighters at all levels from frontline troops to general
officers. By contrast, PLA forces have not fought a war since their 1979
incursion into Vietnam, when they performed less than impressively
against Vietnamese troops and withdrew after one month.

#### Internal Factors prevent China from achieving hegemony

[China exhibits weaknesses in its hegemonic potential, some of them
self-inflicted. Serious political instability inside China would
undercut attempts to play a regional leadership role]{.underline}. Yet
[Xi Jinping's re-centralization of political power since 2012 has made
the Chinese political system more brittle. Eliminating the term limits
for his leadership tenure adds to the enemies Xi has made through his
anti-corruption campaign]{.underline}. [Many ambitious
elites]{.underline} outside of Xi's protégés now see no opportunity to
rise up in the ranks of power.23 Some of them might [resort to working
against Xi,]{.underline} hoping to benefit from a leadership crisis.
[Xi's accumulation of unchecked power has also intensified the danger
that he will make a disastrous national policy decision that might
otherwise be avoided by a collective leadership
arrangement.]{.underline} Indeed, the Party's movement in the early
post-Mao era from rule by a single all-powerful paramount leader to rule
by a small group of top Politburo members was a reaction to the profound
harm done to China by Mao's unchecked decision-making, including his
launch of the Great Leap Forward (1958--62) and Great Proletarian
Cultural Revolution (1966--76). Xi has now restored that discredited
leadership model. [Furthermore, Xi has increased the likelihood of a
disruptive socio-political crisis inside China through his accelerated
authoritarianism. Xi's approaches to managing large groups of people
considered possible threats to the authority of the Party have been
heavy-handed rather than skillful.]{.underline} These approaches include
crackdowns against Tibetan Buddhists and Chinese Christians, [mass
incarceration and attempted indoctrination]{.underline} of Uyghurs,
prematurely dismantling the autonomy promised for Hong Kong, and revived
constraints on intellectuals and advocates of a stronger civil society
in China. [Overreliance on the available tools of oppression in the
short term risks worsening public anger and desperation in the longer
term. A simmering cauldron of various discontents at home does not help
China project power abroad.]{.underline}

#### Cracks in China's Economic Foundation prevent China from achieving hegemony

**Roy 20** -- Denny; Ph.D. in political science, University of Chicago,
1991) writes mainly on Northeast Asian international security issues;
"China won't achieve regional hegemony"; 19 Mar 2020, , The Washington
Quarterly, 43:1, 101-117, DOI: 10.1080/0163660X.2020.1734301

[An exceptionally strong economy is a necessary foundation for
projecting hegemonic power. China has established itself as the top
supplier of manufactured goods to the Indo-Pacific countries, creating a
common perception of growing Chinese economic domination. China's
economic strength, however, is **easily exaggerated**.]{.underline}
Official Chinese statistics consistently overstate Chinese growth and
wealth. [Assessments of the size of China's economy typically employ GDP
adjusted by purchasing power parity (PPP). The PPP method, which
controls for the different prices of the same commodities in different
economies, artificially inflates the appearance of wealth in a
relatively poor country being compared to a richer country.]{.underline}
More generally, emphasis on GDP as the key indicator of economic
vitality obscures the problem of what [economists call "bad
GDP]{.underline}." This term refers to outcomes that do not contribute
to national strength such as overproduction and unrepaid debt.
Tellingly, China had a larger economy than countries such as Britain and
Japan which militarily rode roughshod over China in the nineteenth
century.24 An alternative, and in some ways more meaningful, measurement
is GDP per capita[. On this score, China was actually below the world
average in 2018 (US\$11,312) at US\$9,771 and far below the US figure of
US\$62,641.25]{.underline} [Several serious structural flaws threaten
China's future economic growth. China's banks are state-owned and lend
mainly to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) which are largely
unprofitable.]{.underline}26 The banking industry could easily collapse
under even a moderate economic shock, dragging down the entire financial
system.27 [Tackling the country's massive air and water pollution
problems will be a drag on Chinese economic growth far into the
future]{.underline}.28 Many [Americans are deeply concerned that US debt
is now over 100 percent of US GDP---but China's debt has reached 300
percent of China's GDP.]{.underline}29 Although large, [China's economy
is not especially productive, lagging far behind the United
States.]{.underline}30 The International Monetary Fund calculates that
growth in China's total factor productivity, or the amount of production
not accounted for by increased inputs, has averaged only about 2 percent
annually since the global financial crisis that began in 2007.31
[**Several serious structural flaws threaten China's future economic
growth.** Continued nominal rapid economic growth in China is uncertain.
Even according to Chinese official statistics, which are often
intentionally inflated, during 2019 China saw its slowest GDP growth
rate since 1992, and the slowdown was not a result of China's trade war
with the United States. Rather, it is consistent with a decade-long
trend of decline based on gradual changes within the Chinese
economy]{.underline}.32China is far from guaranteed to join the short
list of countries that have successfully moved from middle-income to
high-income, and China's immense size will make the challenge relatively
more difficult. China's demographic trends suggest changes that will
force Chinese economic growth into a long-term period of leveling off.
China will certainly "grow old before it grows rich," at least in terms
of per capita GDP. China's huge population will begin gradually
declining around 2025, mainly because couples are choosing to have fewer
children because of the rising cost of living and because the "one
child" policy, combined with the cultural preference for boys, created a
reduction in the female population, resulting in a drop in births. The
cohort of workers aged 18 to 30, which supplies factory labor and is
crucial to maintaining the country's economic growth, is already
shrinking.33 By 2030, China will have a retiree for every two
working-age people,34 which will require both the state and individual
families to divert a large amount of their resources into care for the
elderly. Much of China's economic dynamism of the post-Mao years
resulted from harnessing a gigantic pool of low-cost labor created by
young people moving from the countryside into urban factory work. But
with 60 percent of China's population now living in the cities35 and
many other countries providing cheaper labor, China will need to find
other ways of sustaining rapid growth.CCP elites recognize the need for
economic restructuring but have struggled to implement it. Outgoing PRC
Premier Wen Jiabao famously warned in 2013 that China's economic growth
was "unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable."36 Since Deng
Xiaoping began promoting major marketizing reforms in 1978, the Chinese
government has struggled to find a balance between two contradictory
imperatives: economic growth and stability. To ensure continued healthy
economic growth, China needs to decrease central control, speed
liberalization, and stop coddling loss-making SOEs. Such policies,
however, damage the Party's popularity by creating mass unemployment and
social upheaval. The Chinese government led by Hu Jintao (2002--12)
decided to implement the principle of allowing the market to determine
the allocation of resources. Predictably, this effort floundered because
it threatened the accustomed profitability of various powerful interest
groups including bureaucracies, provincial governments, industrial
sectors, and the military. Xi ascended to paramount leadership in 2012
with a mandate to restart the marketization of the Chinese economy, but,
against the usual opposition, he has achieved only modest reforms
despite vigorously suppressing dissent and removing many of his enemies.
Xi's efforts are at least partly negated by countervailing policies such
as strengthening Party control over business decisions, favoring chosen
SOEs over the private sector, increasing political interference in the
judicial system, tightening the restrictions on discussion of political
issues in China, and requiring China's best minds to divert their
attention away from innovative activities to read Xi Jinping Thought.37
The CCP seems trapped by its unwillingness to tolerate the political
consequences of the changes necessary to unlock China's economic
potential. [The required capabilities for hegemony are a relatively
large and healthy economy, a]{.underline} technologically advanced
military that can project decisive power far beyond national borders,
and a government that is able to pursue a coherent and effective
strategy without being impeded by domestic political or social
conditions. China need not solve all of its internal problems as a
prerequisite to dominating its region---having only a moderately wealthy
society, for example, would not necessarily prevent the PRC from having
a wealthy state that could pour resources into enhancing national
military strength. [It is possible that China could muddle through its
domestic political, economic, and social challenges for the next few
decades while maintaining a solid growth rate and fielding Asia's
strongest military forces. The standard for hegemony, however, is higher
than this]{.underline}. It seems unlikely that China will overcome its
internal challenges to achieve a sufficiently strong and stable platform
from which to attempt to dominate the region.

#### China cannot rival US hegemony -- negative perceptions by other powers and a lack of others sharing their vision hamper Chinese hegemony

However, [for China to be capable of reshaping the international order,
it needs to have partners that share]{.underline} its vision.
[International order is built through developing strong friendships with
prominent powers]{.underline} that encompass not only strategic and
normative alignments but also cultural understanding as well as strong
historical foundations. The problem for China is that, b[eyond Russia,
Pakistan and some quasi-client states in Africa, very few countries seem
ready to jump aboard the "express train of China's development". The
negative state of global perceptions is a significant blow to China's
international]{.underline} aims and [desires]{.underline}. Some of this
is beyond [China's]{.underline} control. Its [status as a non-Western
rising power means that]{.underline} whatever it does, [it will be
viewed with suspicion by outsiders]{.underline} (especially [in the
current West-centric order]{.underline}).

[Most realist international relations theories]{.underline}
([and]{.underline} [even most liberal ones]{.underline}) [follow some
fundamental assumptions]{.underline}\--that [the world is]{.underline}
[anarchic without a global policeman and global hegemony is
unsustainable]{.underline}. Nation-states, the primary units of
international politics, seek to survive in that anarchy. Of them, [great
powers are the main actors.]{.underline} [States seeking hegemony are
often balanced]{.underline}, as balancing is the norm. The system is
amoral and Darwinian, and [most hegemons overstretch and collapse,
though some smart powers successfully retrench, or even \"buck-pass\" to
other states during times of stress]{.underline}. Different schools of
realism can, of course, claim and predict different ways on whether and
how states seek survival. Some would argue that states are power
maximizers, while others would argue that states are overwhelmingly
security maximizers. Different schools of realism also conclude
different behavior even while analyzing from the same theoretical
baseline. For example, [all realists agree that China is the biggest
potential threat to American interests]{.underline}. [Some might argue
that the United States needs to arm Taiwan and balance China actively by
facilitating an alliance network in the Asia-]{.underline}Pacific.
[Others might prefer the United States to be \"offshore balancers\" and
buck-pass the security burden to regional powers, drawing attention to
the fact that China is practically alliance-less and is surrounded by
powerful and rich states]{.underline} ([most of them ideologically
aligned with the United States or opposed to potential Chinese
hegemony]{.underline}), one with nuclear power and all with large
navies. The Asia-Pacific in 2021 is dissimilar to a broken Europe in
1949, susceptible to an expansionist Soviet Union. Regardless, [all
realists agree that America is a very secure great power]{.underline},
with a [geographical advantage and hemispheric hegemony]{.underline},
and [overwhelming aggregate power compared to peer rivals]{.underline}.
[Most top universities are in the United States, as are most top defense
industrial sectors, businesses, and companies. The United States still
commands the global commons and is the primary destination of
trade]{.underline}, and while there might be trade rivals such as the EU
and China, it is [unlikely that there will be a great power challenger
that will topple America from its perch at least in the near foreseeable
future]{.underline}. Commensurate with the logic of realism, there are
two regions that are of primary interest for American strategic
security: [Western Europe and the Eastern Pacific. If dominated by a
rival hegemon, these regions can make the American coastline
vulnerable]{.underline} [and can result in consolidated economic power
in rival hands, overwhelming American trade]{.underline}. In other
words, [these are regions where the United States did and would again do
anything to prevent an expansionist hegemony of a peer
rival]{.underline}. That said, [there are no threats of Russian armor
sweeping through the Belgian meadows anytime soon, nor is there any
likelihood of Chinese marines landing in Japan and Australia in a war of
expansion]{.underline}. [If China starts a war with India, Taiwan, or
Vietnam, it would at worst be bogged down in a gruesome war of attrition
comparable to World War I, and at best be mired in a bleeding long-term
counterinsurgency far worse than Iraq and Afghanistan. Either of these
scenarios would almost certainly end any potential Chinese
expansionism.]{.underline}

#### Chinese Heg is regional NOT global at best

**Foot '19**, Rosemary Foot, Department of Politics and International
Relations, University of Oxford, 09/04/19, International politics,
"China's rise and US hegemony: Renegotiating hegemonic order in East
Asia?",
(https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1057/s41311-019-00189-5#Sec6)

[China is enunciating these predominantly economic-security-related
ideas and backing them up with policy action at a time when the Western
powers and the USA in particular apparently have lost their attachment
to or confidence in the liberal normative model associated especially
with the 1990s]{.underline}---[democracy, human rights promotion and
protection, and belief in the power of the market to deliver benefits to
the majority]{.underline}. [A more powerful China has emerged into a
world that Beijing believes to be less resistant to its approach and
political--economic model]{.underline}, containing a more obvious
proliferation of values within which Chinese ideas can find greater
purchase. [This enabling environment should allow China to form at least
what Clark refers to as a 'coalitional hegemony'---that is, acceptance
or legitimation of its role as a reshaper or creator of regional order
but perhaps only among a subset of potential members]{.underline} and
what he refers to as a 'restricted constituency of support' (2011b, 123;
Goh 2019, 635). [A rather restricted constituency becomes more likely as
an outcome because, while China's material attributes impress and some
of its ideas resonate, they have not all been put to the benign purposes
of reassurance]{.underline}. Neither does the Chinese leadership
acknowledge the ways in which the diversity of the Asia-Pacific
complicates receptivity to the solutions to regional ordering that it
proposes, or the doubts that some of China's own commentators have
expressed and that can weaken its central message. [The bar is always
set high anyway for the rising challenger. It is inevitably seen as the
disrupter and it is a matter of interpretation and experience whether
that disruption is on balance for the good or bad.]{.underline}

### A2: EU Rise

#### It's still unlikely to be the EU

**Norrlof 10** -- Carla, Professor of Political Science at the
University of Toronto, "America\'s Global Advantage : US Hegemony and
International Cooperation", 4/29/10, Cambridge University Press,
https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/lib/umichigan/detail.action?docID=502502.

Furthermore, [the European Union is]{.underline}, I think, [more likely
to displace American power]{.underline}. The reason is simple.
[Cooperation in Europe cuts to the heart of core superpower functions.
The European Union has a large product market where other countries can
offload their exports. A European currency union has been in force for a
decade, supplying the euro, a currency widely used, with the potential
of becoming the primary currency.]{.underline} Significant advances have
also been made in the field of security cooperation. [Despite these
portents, even the European Union is unlikely to take over America's
role in the world economy.]{.underline} While it is possible that the
euro will crowd the dollar out to the extent that a symmetrical,
multiple, key currency system, is introduced, [the euro is unlikely to
replace the dollar as key currency. On the security dimension, there is
no prospect for the European Union to rival the United States in the
foreseeable future.]{.underline} It is even unclear whether the
political will exists to create a rival autonomous capability. The
second Bush presidency did much to speed up security cooperation, but
the initiative quickly petered out, and one wonders how much
transatlantic discord would be needed to create a critical security
force when policies so disliked in European quarters could not generate
stronger developments. T[his gets to the crux of what keeps American
hegemony alive. Transforming the current power structure is not only
about America's relative weakening, but also about other states'
incentives and capacities to organize. **Currently, they are too
dependent on America**. **They cannot project power because they do not
have the autonomy to define and pursue their interests.** Both East Asia
and Europe rely on America economically and militarily, Europe less so
economically than in the past. But, as we have seen, economic and
security functions intersect. This makes it virtually impossible to
reach the top, without assuring self-sufficiency in both domains. Of
course, in our globalized world, no actor can turn its back on all
others in the system. Everyone is interdependent to some extent,
although not everyone is dependent to the same extent. Recognizing
shared dependence is important for all actors but, for any single actor
with the ambition to rule the world, paying attention to the
differential vulnerability that comes with relative dependence is
imperative. If other Great Powers become serious about closing the
American era, they will not be able to continue to depend on the
American system for their economic well-being and basic security. Those
longing for another world order may be disappointed with them for
lacking the political will to stand on their own feet.]{.underline}
However, a crisp lesson from this exploration of the determinants and
consequences of American power may very well be that, while breaking
away from an inequitable system which is exploitative is hard, breaking
away from an inequitable system which is not, is harder. The
substitution of American leadership is slowed by the way American power
is exercised. Not quite benevolent, [the current world order is, for the
most part, mutually beneficial. Everyone benefits from cooperation,
although not everyone benefits equally, and the gains from cooperation
are asymmetrically distributed at the crest. This leads me to predict
that rapid decline is not on its way. **America will bounce back,
preserving its unique position in the international system for the
foreseeable future.**]{.underline}

## Impacts

### Impact -- Great Power War

#### American unipolarity solves great power war.

**Beckley 18** - \[Michael, Michael Beckley is a Fellow in the
International Security Program at Harvard Kennedy School\'s Belfer

Political Science at Tufts University. "Unrivaled: Why America Will
Remain the World\'s Sole Superpower", Published 2018, Cornell University

The story of world politics is often told as a game of thrones in which
a rotating cast of great powers battles for top-dog status. According to
researchers led by Graham Allison at Harvard, [there have been sixteen
cases in the past five hundred years when a rising power challenged a
ruling power. Twelve of these cases ended in carnage.]{.underline} One
can quibble with Allison's case selection, but the basic pattern is
clear: [hegemonic rivalry has sparked a catastrophic war every forty
years on average for the past half millennium. The emergence of
unipolarity in 1991 has put this cycle of hegemonic competition on
hold.]{.underline} Obviously wars and security competition still occur
in today's unipolar world---in fact, as I explain later, unipolarity has
made certain types of asymmetric conflict more likely---but none of
these conflicts have the global scope or generational length of a
hegemonic rivalry. To appreciate this point, just consider the Cold
War---one of the four "peaceful" cases of hegemonic rivalry identified
by Allison's study. Although the two superpowers never went to war, they
divided the world into rival camps, waged proxy wars that killed
millions of people, and pushed each other to the brink of nuclear
Armageddon. For forty-five years, World War III and human extinction
were nontrivial possibilities. [Since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
by contrast, the United States has not faced a hegemonic rival, and the
world, though far from perfect, has been more peaceful and prosperous
than ever before. Just look at the numbers. From 1400 to 1991, the rate
of war deaths worldwide hovered between 5 and 10 deaths per 100,000
people and spiked to 200 deaths per 100,000 during major wars. 4 After
1991, however, war death rates dropped to 0.5 deaths per 100,000 people
and have stayed there ever since. Interstate wars have disappeared
almost entirely, and the number of civil wars has declined by more than
30 percent.]{.underline} [Meanwhile, the global economy has quadrupled
in size, creating more wealth between 1991 and 2018 than in all prior
human history combined.]{.underline} What explains this unprecedented
outbreak of peace and prosperity? Some scholars attribute it to advances
in communications technology, from the printing press to the telegraph
to the Internet, which supposedly spread empathy around the globe and
caused entire nations to place a higher value on human life. Such
explanations are appealing, because they play on our natural desire to
believe in human progress, but are they convincing? Did humans suddenly
become 10 to 20 times less violent and cruel in 1991? Are we orders of
magnitude more noble and kind than our grandparents? Has social media
made us more empathetic? Of course not, which is why the dramatic
decline in warfare after 1991 is better explained by geopolitics than
sociology. The collapse of the Soviet Union not only ended the Cold War
and related proxy fighting, it also opened up large swathes of the world
to democracy, international commerce, and peacekeeping forces---all of
which surged after 1991 and further dampened conflict. Faced with
overwhelming U.S. economic and military might, most countries have
decided to work within the American-led liberal order rather than fight
to overturn it. [As of 2018, nearly seventy countries have joined the
U.S. alliance network---a Kantian community in which war is
unthinkable---and even the two main challengers to this community, China
and Russia, begrudgingly participate in the institutions of the liberal
order (e.g., the UN, the WTO, the IMF, World Bank, and the G-20), engage
in commerce with the United States and its allies, and contribute to
international peacekeeping missions.]{.underline} History may not have
ended in 1991, but it clearly changed in profound ways---and mostly for
the better.

### Impact -- Russia

#### Russia is empirically aggressive, and is now exercising capabilities to threaten the United States, but NATO hegemony checks that

Patty-Jane **Geller 5-6-**2022; Senior Policy Analyst, Center for

deterrence and missile defense at The Heritage Foundation. "Traditional
Victory Over Russia Is Unlikely. Instead, Expect To Manage Competition
for the Long Haul," The Heritage Foundation,
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/traditional-victory-over-russia-unlikely-instead-expect-manage-competition-the>

[After many years of U.S. hegemony following the Cold War, Russia has
gained---and is exercising---the capabilities to threaten the United
States and its interests abroad. Russia invests in military capabilities
to confront the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other
neighboring states.]{.underline} Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea
demonstrated its use of hybrid warfare to accomplish its aims and
project power across the Black Sea. [Moscow is propping up Syrian
dictator Bashir al-Assad, defending Iran at the United Nations (UN)
Security Council, and amassing military forces in the Arctic. It has
authorized multiple cyber-attacks against the United States and
continues to target vulnerabilities in the U.S. defense industrial base.
It uses political warfare to sow discord in the United States, from
interfering in U.S. elections to spreading propaganda about the
"dangers" of U.S missile defense]{.underline}. Perhaps most
significantly, Russia invests billions of dollars into adding to its
nuclear arsenal and developing new nuclear capabilities, disrupting the
nuclear balance with the United States. Consequently, the current and
previous administrations have framed U.S.-Russia relations as a
competition, which involves two states striving for global power and
opposing interests. Such a competition implies that actors in opposition
to each other are pursuing a victory. But what does it look like to win
in a competition with Russia? Based on the U.S. history of war and
conflict, Americans typically view winning a competition as a definitive
change in status quo, or strategic realignment, that works in the U.S.
favor. A model American victory might look like the outcome of the
Revolutionary War, which resulted in the independent American state, or
Japan's transformation to a democratic ally after it lost World War II.
It once appeared that the United States was making progress toward this
model of strategic realignment for Russia after the Cold War ended and
the Soviet Union fell. Much of U.S.-Russian policy through the 2000's
was rooted in the idea that with a little more nudging, Russia would
complete the transition from unfriendly autocracy to democratic member
of the rules-based international order. Such policy is evidenced by
President George W. Bush's push for a new era of improved relations with
Russia, and President Barack Obama's attempted Russian "reset." While
the Russian threat has worsened in recent years, one school of thought
argues that the United States can still achieve this strategic
realignment once Russia achieves full internal political change.
Activists like Vladimir Kara-Murza argue such change could occur in the
near term. Another camp argues that the United States can end the
competition if it stops antagonizing Russia. This school of thought
accepts the premise that U.S. capabilities like missile defense provoke
Russia to build up its forces and asserts that unilateral concessions
will convince Russia to draw back its forces as well. Others go further
to argue that the Russian threat is overblown and Russia is too weak to
pose a serious threat, so there is no competition to "win;" instead, the
United States should redirect unneeded resources away from U.S.-Russia
competition. Get exclusive insider information from Heritage experts

This paper argues that Russia's fundamental nature and interests will
continue to threaten the United States for the foreseeable future and
therefore a path to a traditional concept of victory is unlikely[. It
rejects the idea that Russia will achieve full internal change and
become friendly to the United States due to its longstanding nature as
an aggressive, paranoid, power-seeking, and autocratic state, no matter
its leader. Based on this assessment, concessions or attempts at
cooperation with Russia will fail. Indeed, history illustrates that
Russia interprets these as weaknesses and exploits the opportunity to
advance its position.]{.underline} \>\>\> Where's Biden on Growing
Nuclear Threats[? As a result, the closest the United States can come to
"winning" is successfully managing competition with Russia to mitigate
the threat it poses and keep Russian aggression at bay. To manage
competition, the United States must strengthen its capabilities and
posture required to deter Russian mischief in all arenas of competition
as well as avoid making concessions.]{.underline} This recommendation
includes, but is not limited to[, increasing U.S. defense budgets;
strengthening nuclear deterrence; countering and maintaining resiliency
to Russian political warfare; and actively responding to Russian
aggression in the European theater]{.underline}. Russia's Nature Makes
Favorable Change Unlikely U.S.-Russian relations have ebbed and flowed
over the past century. [Although different Russian leaders or world
circumstances have made for a more cordial relationship with Russia at
times, Russian history demonstrates that the interests and tendencies
that cause conflict with the United States today are inherent to
Russia's character.]{.underline} These tendencies are therefore unlikely
to change in a manner favorable to U.S. interests. [Russia has a history
of aggression toward its neighbors that has often resulted in loss or
humiliation. While the United States has largely avoided conflict within
its borders due to its geographic isolation, Russia has fought with
bordering states or territories throughout its history. As early as the
1100's, what was then the Kievan Rus federation suffered brutal losses
by fighting the Mongols. Later, Russia lost the Crimean War of 1853, the
Russo-Japanese War of 1904 after invading Japan, World War I, and the
Cold War. The Russians also battled Napoleon in 1812 and Nazi Germany
during World War II. This history of fighting and invasion strongly
influences Russia's national character]{.underline}. Due to its vast and
near-indefensible territory, [Russia is aggressive and even paranoid
about any potential threats to its sovereignty.]{.underline} In the
1100's, the Mongols invaded when Russian princes rejected a Mongolian
peace request out of fear and suspicion that the Mongols would advance
into Russian territory. To protect its territory, Russia has sought to
preempt invasion by expanding its borders or establishing a buffer zone
of friendly actors. As Catherine the Great famously stated, "I have no
way to defend my borders but to extend them." During the Cold War, the
Soviet Union maintained rule over its border satellite states to
strengthen its defense against growing NATO forces. Even after the war,
former Russian President Boris Yeltsin tried to establish a Commonwealth
of Independent States with former Soviet satellite states to maintain
influence and leverage surrounding its borders. Russia maintains a sense
of providential destiny to be a great power and avoid humiliation. This
sense of entitlement has been expressed in different ways throughout
Russian history. [Russians take pride in their defeats by attrition of
Napoleon and Nazi Germany, which they refer to as the Patriotic War of
1812 and The Great Patriotic War, respectively. During the Cold War, the
Soviets saw themselves as the vanguard of worldwide revolution.
Intertwined with Russia's desire to expand its borders or maintain a
buffer zone as part of its paranoid defense, expansion has also been
integral to this sense of exceptionalism. As expert Leon Aron describes,
unlike in Western Europe, Russian expansion occurred at the same time as
state-building. For instance, early expansion was justified through the
spread of Russian Orthodoxy, and later through the advance of communism
during the era of the Soviet Union. This great power entitlement often
clashes with the fact that Russia has "almost always been a relatively
weak power" that faces humiliating defeats over time. As a result, it is
in Moscow's nature to avoid embarrassment on the international stage
while pushing back on hegemonic powers like the United
States.]{.underline} Finally, Russia takes pride in its culture and
civilization that dates back over 1,000 years. This pride often
manifests itself in national and foreign policy. Nicholas I used the
"Uvarov doctrine" based on Russian orthodoxy, autocracy, and nationality
to unify Russian society in the 1830's when autocratic rule was becoming
more unpopular. The Uvarov doctrine was again used in the early-1900's
to mobilize support for Nicholas II prior to World War I, and even
referenced in the late-1990's as Russian President Vladimir Putin began
to consolidate power. Contrary to U.S. values of democracy and
individual freedom, Russia prioritizes power vested in the
state---autocracy in some form---to provide for the people, from the
rule of Peter the Great, the succession of czars, the totalitarian
Soviet Union, to Putin's current rule. Similarly, Russia rejects any
outside influence, reflected in its staunch anti-westernism during the
Cold War that continues today. Russia's Enduring Character Shapes Its
Posture Against the United States U.S.-Russia competition has persisted
since World War II when the United States emerged as a great power. The
establishment of the U.S.-led, rules-based world order and the NATO
military alliance clashed with Russia's own longstanding ambitions.
While the U.S.-Russia relationship has evolved over time, Russia
consistently acts in accordance with these interests defined by its
enduring nature, and Putin's regime is no different[. Much of Russia's
aggression under Putin, including the invasions of Georgia, Crimea,
Eastern Ukraine, and Syria, reflects Moscow's paranoia over defending
its sovereignty.]{.underline} While the American public might see Putin
as particularly aggressive compared to other recent leaders, according
to Aron, "Putin is merely the latest Russian ruler to embrace Catherine
the Great's mantra" of extending borders to defend them. [To paraphrase
political scientist John Mearsheimer, Russia invaded Georgia and Ukraine
because the potential for those border countries to join NATO could
threaten Russian sovereignty.]{.underline} Russia goes to extensive
lengths to constrain U.S. missile defense out of a fear that the United
States could gain the ability to defend against a Russian retaliatory
strike. These efforts persist despite current and planned U.S. missile
defense deployments remaining far too few to neutralize Russia's massive
nuclear arsenal and retaliatory capability. While seemingly illogical,
vulnerability to a first strike poses an existential threat that feeds
into Russian paranoia over any threat to its sovereignty. This paranoia
suggests that the interest in mitigating U.S. strategic forces will not
change. Putin's regime also reflects a desire to heighten Russia's
status as a great power. At the 2007 Munich Security Conference, Putin
described Russia as "a country with a history that spans more than a
thousand years \[that\] has practically always used the privilege to
carry out an independent foreign policy." He infamously referred to the
dissolution of the Soviet Union as "the greatest geopolitical
catastrophe of the century" because Russia lost significant acquired
territory[. Maintaining its status as a nuclear power is also imperative
to Russian great power pursuits. In addition to modernizing and
numerically increasing existing nuclear capabilities, Russia is building
entirely new nuclear capabilities, often referred to as "exotic" or
"super" weapons, such as a nuclear-powered cruise missile and underwater
drone that can reportedly carry a 100-megaton weapon. Many analysts
argue that these weapons provide value in asserting Russia as a great
nuclear power. Indeed, Putin recently boasted, "We have the most
cutting-edge nuclear deterrence forces out of all nuclear powers."
Russia seeks to surpass the United States in nuclear capabilities to
solidify its status as top nuclear power]{.underline}. [The Kremlin uses
its footholds around the world to undermine American soft power and
world leadership, which stand in the way of its great power pursuits.
For instance, Russia challenged America in Syria by employing its
sea-launched cruise missiles (that could also carry nuclear weapons) and
using its traction there to project power in the Middle East. Russia
also leverages techniques to spread disinformation and propaganda,
including cyber operations, media manipulation, and covert botnet
operations to influence key politicians, journalists, and academics.
This Russian effort to exert its influence around the world and
challenge the United States has not changed from the Cold War, during
which the Soviet Union used political warfare to hamper American
influence in Europe and foment instability within the United States and
between the United States and its allies. Putin justifies much of his
aggression based on the long-standing Russian practice of rejecting
external influence---in the contemporary case, Western democracy---in
favor of historic Russian values and pride.]{.underline} Putin labeled
Russia a "unique civilization" that has endured hundreds of years of
great power wars. He considers rejecting western values critical to
maintaining Russia's greatness. When discussing the need to balance
against U.S. unipolarity in 2007, Putin stated, "\[W\]e are constantly
being taught about democracy. But for some reason those who teach us do
not want to learn themselves," referring to U.S. democracy-building
efforts across the world. Just as Russia stopped the global domination
efforts by the Mongols and Napoleon, it now sees the need to stop U.S.
hegemony. This interest is vital to Russia's historic character, and it
is unlikely to change any time soon. The Accident of Putin? Scholars
like Michael McFaul, President Obama's Ambassador to Russia, argue that
current competition with Russia is a result of the "accident of Putin."
They assert that the 1990's were a missed opportunity to reform
U.S.-Russia relations, and if long-time democracy advocate Boris Nemtsov
were named prime minister instead of Putin in 1999, relations with
Russia would look very different today. Based on this argument, the
intensity of the competition with Russia depends heavily on the leader
in power. While of course a given leader's personality will have some
impact on relations with the United States, Russia's enduring nature
demonstrates that so long as the United States obstructs Russia's
pursuit of its revisionist goals, competition will persist. Periods of
improved relations between Russia and the United States only occur when
Russia lacks the national power to aggressively pursue its overarching
interests. The 1990's are often characterized as a period of friendly
relations with Russia given Yeltsin's initial desire to become closer to
the United States and even his attempt to join NATO. However, Russia's
conflicting interests with the United States were the same then as now;
the difference was Russia's lack of power after the Cold War. For
example, in the early 1990's, the UN and United States pressured Yeltsin
to withdraw all Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia. Yeltsin tried to
make withdrawal dependent on securing rights for Russian ethnic speakers
in those countries, the same narrative Putin uses to justify the current
occupation in Ukraine. The difference was that Yeltsin caved to the U.S.
threat to withhold much-needed aid if Russia did not withdraw troops,
while the United States and NATO have not been able to compel the
current Russian regime---much stronger than that of the 1990's---to
withdraw from Ukraine. After Yeltsin withdrew troops in Estonia and
Latvia, he tried to maintain leverage in former Soviet states, even
encouraging a Crimean independence movement to impinge on Ukraine's
claims to the Black Sea Fleet. Again, the difference between Russia's
interest in Crimean independence in the 1990's and today is that it did
not then have the strength to actualize this goal. Indeed, according to
Russia experts Fiona Hill and Clifford G. Gaddy, "There was a general
perception, in both the Yeltsin government and parliament, that Russia
was being treated as a developing or second-tier country by the
\[W\]est," a sentiment that reflects Russia's immense pride and desire
to be treated as a great power. Russia's inability to pursue its
aggressive interests in the 1990's has since changed. As the United
States drew down its military forces to pivot to counterterrorism in the
2000's, Russia sought to rebuild its military. It invested in asymmetric
capabilities like informational and cyber warfare and pursued a nuclear
modernization program, which is now at least 86% complete. (In
comparison, the United States is barely beginning its long-overdue
nuclear modernization effort.) Russia also rebuilt its stockpile of
non-strategic, or tactical nuclear weapons unconstrained by the New
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) to the point where Russia
now outnumbers the United States in this category by at least ten to
one. The "accident of Putin" camp also references the reset in
U.S.-Russian relations from 2009-2013 under Obama and Russian President
Dmitry Medvedev. According to McFaul, Medvedev complied with Obama's
attempted reset because he sought Obama's respect. However, McFaul
concedes that Medvedev did little to actually implement democratic
reforms, despite talking often about democracy. Under Medvedev's
administration, Russia turned off the natural gas supply to Ukraine;
remained hostile to U.S. missile defenses even as Obama cancelled
additional deployments; and vetoed UN action against the Syrian regime
in 2011. The 2010 New START agreement accomplished little for this reset
because the treaty's cap on nuclear warheads enabled Russia to increase
its forces to the outlined maximum while the United States made
reductions. Russia also exploited the flawed treaty by building nuclear
weapons the treaty did not limit, like nuclear-tipped hypersonic glide
vehicles. While Medvedev's tone seemed to offset competition, Russia's
great power interests persisted. Despite a complete change in government
after the Cold War and an attempted reset in relations, Russia never
strategically realigned. As historian Stephen Kotkin eloquently
explains: In this context, it is useful to recognize that there has
actually never been a period of sustained good relations between Russia
and the United States. (Declassified documents reveal that even the
World War II alliance was fraught with deeper distrust and greater cross
purposes than has generally been understood.) This has been due not to
misunderstandings, miscommunication, or hurt feelings but rather to
divergent fundamental values and state interests, as each country has
defined them. For Russia, the highest value is the state; for the United
States, it is individual liberty, private property, and human rights,
usually set out in opposition to the state. So expectations should be
kept in check. Because Russia's aggression stems not from a particular
leader but from its enduring character, the United States can expect to
continue competing with Russia even after Putin. U.S. Concessions Have
Not Moderated Russian Behavior Russia interprets U.S. concessions as
weakness that provides opportunities to further pursue its ambitions.
Indeed, Russia's goals extend beyond minimizing any threat posed by the
United States to actively improving Russia's status as a great power. A
weakened United States will not persuade Russia to back down; rather, it
will allow Russia to further propel its ambitions forward. The history
of U.S.-Russian relations is replete with examples of this occurring.
Indeed, Russia historically continued to build up its forces and pursue
its adventurist ambitions even when the United States reduced its own
forces and backed off the international stage. For example, as part of
the Obama administration's attempted reset, the 2010 Nuclear Posture
Review (NPR) asserted that Russia and the United States were no longer
adversaries and emphasized the reduction of the role of U.S. nuclear
weapons. In fact, since the Cold War, the United States drastically
reduced its nuclear stockpile, unilaterally removing thousands of
non-strategic nuclear weapons from its arsenal, halting nuclear weapons
testing, and allowing its nuclear enterprise to atrophy. Today, there is
no room to delay building back necessary capabilities. If, as one theory
of victory posits, Russian aggression were solely a response to the U.S.
threat, then the United States' decision to shrink its nuclear
capabilities should have assured Russia it had no need to further expand
its arsenal. However, Russia instead dramatically increased its number
and types of nuclear capabilities. The 2018 NPR stated, "While the
United States has continued to reduce the number and salience of nuclear
weapons, others, including Russia and China, have moved in the opposite
direction. They have added new types of nuclear capabilities to their
arsenals, increased the salience of nuclear forces in their strategies
and plans, and engaged in increasingly aggressive behavior..." Moscow
argues that U.S. missile defense capabilities hamper Russia's ability to
retaliate against a U.S. nuclear strike and uses this flawed logic to
justify new nuclear capabilities. In 2018, Putin cited U.S. missile
defense as his impetus for developing six exotic new nuclear delivery
systems, even though the United States has made only minor upgrades to
its missile defense system over the last two decades. By that logic,
were the United States to limit its missile defenses, Russia would not
advance its offensive systems. Yet history illustrates that the exact
opposite occurs. From 1972 to 1982, a time when the United States
completely dismantled its existing homeland missile defense system, the
Soviet Union added 10,000 warheads to its deployed arsenal -- one of the
largest force increases in its history. As famously stated by former
Secretary of Defense Harold Brown during the Cold War, "When we build,
they build. When we stop, they build." President Joe Biden's
administration has made multiple concessions for Putin to exploit. In
response to Russia's buildup of military forces near the Ukrainian
border in the spring of 2021, the United States announced it would send
warships to the Black Sea. Concerned with escalating tensions with
Russia, Biden recalled the ships, and just days later, Moscow announced
it would restrict access to the Black Sea for six months. The Biden
administration's extension of New START also feeds into Putin's hands
because it allows Russia to continue exploiting the treaty's flaws and
provides no incentive to halt its nuclear buildup. In fact, Putin
already deployed to the Middle East a Kinzhal hypersonic missile---a new
weapon not limited by New START---while the United States draws down its
forces in the region and negotiates with Iran. The number of examples of
Russia exploiting U.S. concessions to pursue its ambitions exceeds the
scope of this paper. These cases demonstrate that Russia's ambitions are
such that it sees windows of opportunity when the United States exhibits
weakness. Managing U.S.-Russian Competition As history demonstrates,
Russia will continue to pursue its great power interests despite U.S.
attempts at cooperation or even concessions so long as it has the power
and tools required to do so. Since Russia is unlikely to strategically
realign, the United States should not expect to stop Russia from
pursuing its revisionist interests around the world. Instead, the best
way to engage is to manage the competition to mitigate Russia's ability
to threaten the United States and moderate Russian aggression. At the
very least, the United States needs to avoid making the unilateral
concessions that provoke Russia to pursue further mischief. The United
States should primarily focus on strengthening its position to check
Russian aggression. While this paper does not seek to provide a
comprehensive policy guide to Russian relations, the following
recommendations illustrate ways to manage the competition. First,
Congress and the administration should increase defense budgets to keep
up with inflation at minimum and ideally meet the recommendation of
three to five percent real growth as recommended by the 2018 National
Defense Strategy Commission. The Heritage Foundation's 2022 Index of
U.S. Military Strength concludes that the military can only marginally
meet the demands of the current threat environment, and as this paper
discusses, Russia takes advantage of U.S. shortfalls. Sufficient defense
budgets will enable the United States to make needed improvements to its
forces by procuring more naval ships and aircraft, modernizing old
equipment, and investing in advanced capabilities such as hypersonic
weapons and artificial intelligence. Second, the United States must
pursue a modernized nuclear posture that can deter the Russian nuclear
threat. This recommendation requires fully modernizing U.S. nuclear
forces and avoiding policy proposals like a "no first use" declaratory
policy that only exudes U.S. weakness and damages credibility of
deterrence. The United States must also adjust its force posture to
account for the increasing nuclear threat, including by pursuing the
sea-launched cruise missile-nuclear proposed by the 2018 NPR. Any
unilateral reductions in nuclear forces will only further encourage
Russia and remove any incentive to negotiate a future arms control
agreement. As Senator Deb Fischer (R--NE), the Ranking Member of the
Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces aptly summarized:
"Why would our competitors agree to new rounds of arms reductions if
they knew the U.S. was cutting its forces anyway, regardless of whether
they agreed to do the same?" \>\>\> Russia and Realism, American-Style
Third, [the United States must prioritize countering Russian political
warfare, a tool Russia has long used to gain an asymmetric advantage and
exploit the gray zone area between war and peace. In the 1980's, the
Soviets undertook an intensive political warfare effort to forestall
U.S. deployments of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe. Yet
in a show of perseverance, the United States successfully deployed
Pershing II nuclear-armed missiles in Europe, a victory that eventually
compelled Russia to agree to the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
Treaty of 1987 that banned all missiles of this kind. The United States
must exercise this resiliency to political warfare efforts to manage
competition with Russia today. Fourth, the United States must actively
and forcefully respond to Russian aggression and coercion in Europe. For
Ukraine and Georgia, this means increasing U.S. Navy presence in the
Black Sea, increasing exercises with Ukrainian forces, and strengthening
ties with both countries. The United States should also at least
maintain a force presence in Eastern Europe and complete the Aegis
Ashore missile defense project in Poland. While Biden allowed Russia to
complete construction of its Nord Stream II pipeline, the United States
must maintain sanctions pressure to prevent the dangerous project from
becoming operational. The United States must find the best ways to
demonstrate its resolve to deter Russian aggression in Europe and around
the world because a lack thereof only begets Russian
aggression.]{.underline} Conclusion Unfortunately, managing competition
with Russia will require significant investment and effort that the
American public and the current administration may be reluctant to
make[. The first step to managing Russian conflict is accepting that the
United States is not likely to achieve an idealistic, decisive victory
in the form of strategic realignment. Success will be measured, not as
elimination of the Russian threat, but as a consistent containment of
the threat over time.]{.underline} It might entail achieving arms
control that limits Russia's most dangerous nuclear forces, preventing
further illegal Russian occupation in Europe, and killing the Nord
Stream II pipeline. But the United States should prepare for Russia to
cheat on a future arms control agreement, amass forces outside of its
borders, and seek other economic arrangements that harm U.S. national
security. [The United States must avoid making the same mistake it made
after the Cold War and draw down its forces when Russia becomes weak.
Perhaps a less aggressive leader will replace Putin and restore some
cooperation with the United States, but Russia's long-standing interests
will likely continue to cause it to clash with the United States.
Long-term competition management from a position of strength will remain
the United States' best option.]{.underline}

### Transition Bad -- China

#### A transition to Chinese hegemony is intrinsically violent

**Pathak 15** -- Sriparna, PhD from the Centre for East Asian Studies
(Chinese Studies), Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi,
10/15/15, "The "Peace" in China's Peaceful Rise", E-International
Relations,
https://www.e-ir.info/2015/10/15/the-peace-in-chinas-peaceful-rise/

[In order to answer whether the rise of China in international relations
is a peaceful one or whether it is a Thucydides trap, it is essential to
understand what China means by a "peaceful" rise (later replaced with
peaceful development) followed by a closer look at the theory and
history of great power politics. The concept of "peaceful
rise"]{.underline} (Zhongguo heping jueqi) was an official policy which
[emerged under the leadership of Hu Jintao. The term was an attempt to
rebut against the "China threat theory".]{.underline} [The "peaceful
rise" concept sought to]{.underline} characterise China as a responsible
world player, [emphasis]{.underline}ing [soft power]{.underline} and
that China is committed to its own internal issues and improving the
welfare needs of its citizens before interfering in world affairs.
However, the usage of the term "rise" was seen as controversial since
the word could lead to perceptions that China's "rise" is a threat to
the established international order. Therefore, since 2004, [the term
has been replaced with "peaceful development"]{.underline} (Zhongguo
heping fazhan). The need to come up with such a concept arose because,
as has been seen in the past, the emergence of a new pole of power has
often resulted in drastic changes in the global political structures and
even war -- which is well-explained through the theory of hegemonic
stability and that of offensive realism in particular in International
Relations. The term "peaceful rise" was coined by Zheng Bijian in late
2003. According to Zheng, the rise of new powers in the past lead to an
imbalance in the global political structures and war because these
powers chose the road of aggression and expansion. Zheng Bijian's
[inspiration for the concept arose during an official visit to the
U.S.]{.underline} in December 2002 [where he reportedly experienced the
pervasive discourse of the "China threat" and "China
collapse"]{.underline} first hand. As prescribed by Zheng, [the
P]{.underline}eople's [R]{.underline}epublic of [C]{.underline}hina
[will develop peacefully and, in turn, help to maintain a peaceful
environment.]{.underline} The speech given by Zheng was at the Boao
Forum for Asia in Hainan province. [The real attempt behind the
introduction of the concept was to provide the international audience an
introductory glimpse of the new strategic thinking that was emerging in
China based on newer conceptualizations of power.]{.underline} In
addition to the promotion of the concept of peaceful development, the
[leadership of the country has also embarked on a program of
"neighbourhood diplomacy," emphasising good neighbourliness and
friendship and partnership; China has furthermore asserted that, unlike
Western powers, it can rise peacefully due to its unique Confucian
cultural tradition.]{.underline} However, [history suggests that when a
rapidly rising power threatens an established power, competition
inevitably leads to conflict -- the Thucydides trap in other
words]{.underline}. According to a reading of European imperial history
by scholars such as Kenneth Waltz and Raler & Thomson, [states seek to
maximise their security and therefore their power, which inevitably
leads to inter-state military competition]{.underline}. More recently,
John Mearsheimer has undertaken an analysis of the Asia-Pacific region,
which is now a region of emerging powers. In his book titled the Tragedy
of Great Power Politics (published in 2001) he stated that [the rise of
China in the 21st century will be fraught with challenges. Against this,
as stated previously, stands the Chinese leadership's concept of
peaceful development, which essentially states that Chinese development
will not threaten the established order]{.underline}. [Dr. Yuan-kan
Wang]{.underline}, in his book Harmony and War: Confucian Culture and
Chinese Power Politics, [seeks to address]{.underline} the question of
[whether the Confucian exceptionalism will exempt China from the
traditional patterns of conflict]{.underline} or not. [The study
undertaken by Dr. Wang challenges the popular narrative of China's
historic cultural pacifism, and states that the Confucian tradition is
used as a legitimising mechanism for its development and growing
military power. Dr. Wang's conclusion posits that China will gradually
shift to an offensive grand strategy once it has accumulated sufficient
power.]{.underline}

#### The alternatives are worse\--They offer optimistic Asian perspectives on American hegemony, but a strong US is key to economic integration, preventing obstructive authoritarian ideologies, and international cooperation.

**Nau 09** Professor of Political Science and International Affairs,
George Washington University, "Review: Is American Hegemony Bad or Just
Better than Alternatives?", March 2009, International Studies Review ,
Mar., 2009, Vol. 11, No. 1 (Mar., 2009), pp. 184-186

This collection of essays covers familiar ground but still offers value
as a largely Asian perspective on hegemony and globalization. Fourteen
of the 18 contributors are from Asia, nine from India alone. In an
introduction by Chandra Chari, the volume rejects the notion, popular
among Western realists, that [American hegemony is necessary to avoid
anarchy and expects \"the processes of globalization, which have
economically empowered a large number of countries across the globe,\"
to provide new \"bargaining chips\" to strengthen
multilateralism]{.underline}. Opening chapters address global
perspectives. Eric Hobsbawn, the eminent British scholar, leads off with
a blistering attack against the \"political crazies\" (p. 23) in the
United States who after 9/11 abandoned the \"emollient cream\" (p. 22)
of American Cold War policies and sought global hegemony through
military might. If these crazies prevail, he predicts \"another century
of conflict\" (p. 20). Akira Iriye and Joseph Nye, two equally eminent
Harvard scholars, celebrate the \"momentum toward transnationalism\" (p.
33) ignited by globalization and expect that growing diversity
especially on the economic and information chess boards of world affairs
will check American military pretensions. William Wallace at the
University of Saint Andrews worries that the world may be approaching
\"a nuclear tipping point beyond which a \'cascade of proliferation\'
could occur as states assume that the international nuclear order can no
longer provide them with sufficient protection\" (p. 56). Prem Shankar
Jha, an Indian journalist, argues that \"capitalism has burst its
\'container\'\" for the fifth time in history, spawning each time
widespread social disorder, while T.C.A. Srinivasa-Raghavan, an Indian
business editor, sees a gathering storm of resource competition and
inflation that \"is very similar to what the world saw in the three
decades prior to the First World War\" (p. 82). Paul M. Evans, a
Canadian scholar, sees some hope in the new focus on human security but
then acknowledges that Asian countries in particular fear that \"human
security represents a Western agenda, centring (sic) on such liberal
values and approaches as human rights and humanitarian intervention, and
giving too little weight to economic and development priorities\" (p.
84). Kanti Bajpai and Varun Sahni, Indian academics, close out the first
part of the volume with a chapter that might have usefully served as the
introduction, using three meanings of hegemony\--ideological, liberal
(institutional) and realist\--to explore India\'s thinking and responses
toward globalization. The second half of the book offers regional
assessments of American hegemony and potential alternatives.
Chandrashekhar Dasgupta, a distinguished Indian diplomat, looks at the
European Union and concludes that \"it is unlikely to result in a degree
of unity that might pose a threat to American primacy\" (p. 120). Jorge
Chabat, a Mexican analyst, highlights the leftward tilt of Latin
American politics but concludes that Brazil and Venezuela, the two
countries with hegemonic aspirations to counter the United States, are
likely only to \"annoy the giant and tie him up in multilateral
organizations\" (p. 133). Yu Xin tian, a Chinese contributor,
optimistically predicts the \"peaceful rise\" of China \"whose only
relatively difficult relationship is between China and Japan\" (p. 146).
Vyjayanti Raghavan, an Indian expert, agrees and concludes that [if
China and Japan cooperate, Asia can achieve \"a form of regional
economic integration\" as Europe did when France and Germany
cooperated]{.underline} (p. 173). Akiko Fukushima, a Japanese analyst,
disagrees with the idea of Asian economic integration but envisions a
\"partnership\" that respects rather than shares sovereignty. In
remaining chapters, Simon S.C. Tay, a Singaporean scholar, notes rising
regionalism centered around ASEAN; N. Ravi, an Indian journalist, sees
India and other south Asian countries integrating more with outside
regions than with one another; Hamid Ansari, India\'s vice president in
summer 2008, despairs about American policy in the Middle East; and
Abdul Lamin, a South African professor, urges Africa to seize
opportunities for reform and integration with the global economy. What
is curious about this volume, like so many on globalization, are the
questions it does not address[. There is no serious discussion, for
example, of the security requirements of globalization. If the United
States did not police globalization today, who would? It is true that
hegemony is not the only peaceful configuration of power in history. The
European Union, a community of relatively equal powers, is a current
example. But Germany and France did not cooperate after World War II to
end centuries of internecine European conflict without the presence of
the US security umbrella. To expect China and Japan to cooper ate in the
absence of a continuing US security role in Asia assumes a lot and
requires at least some careful exploration.]{.underline} In addition,
except for the contribution by Bajpai and Sahni, the volume is silent on
the debate going on inside other countries about how those countries
would run the world if the United States were weaker. The focus is
entirely on US dominion which is strongly criticized. But why is there
the implicit expectation that European, Chinese, Japanese, Brazilian or
Indian foreign policy, which according to the volume should benefit from
the new \"bargaining chips\" provided by globalization, would do much
better? [**It\'s natural for non-Americans to be more optimistic about
their contributions to global peace and prosperity**, just as Americans
may be about their contributions. But non-Americans have to make the
case, just as they find fault with the case made by Americans. If
American leadership has been so deficient, how did the Cold War end
without a hot war and how has the world enjoyed unprecedented prosperity
since the Cold War ended]{.underline}? The volume seems [completely
oblivious to the fact that this latest \"outburst\" of capitalism **has
raised the standard of living of more people** living under the poverty
line than ever before.]{.underline} China and India, with most of the
world\'s poorest population, are growing three and four times faster
than Europe, Japan and America, and have been for 20 years or more.
[**Would this have happened under Soviet** (if Moscow had won the Cold
War), **European, Chinese, Indian or Japanese hegemony or
consortium**]{.underline}? [Would these countries have championed freer
trade policies for East Asian and now Chinese, Indian and Latin American
exporters, or sympathized with the promotion of human rights in places
such as Sudan and Zimbabwe, where Russian and Chinese policies currently
block international efforts to stop humanitarian
atrocities?]{.underline} The criticism of America is not the problem. A
dominant power is fair game. [But the criticism also ironically takes
for granted the benefits of American hegemony\--the open markets and
global security provided by US foreign policy, the flexibility of
America\'s middle classes, which have transitioned to better jobs in
America so that more jobs could be created in poorer countries, and the
light footprint of American imperialism that since 1945 has nurtured not
colonies but democratic self-governments in Europe, Asia and
elsewhere.]{.underline} Admittedly, America\'s soft power is under a
cloud, but the relevant question is, compared to what. Some, if not
much, of [the opposition to America has little to do with America. It
has to do with authoritarian ideologies in other countries, particularly
in Asia and the Middle East, that prefer elitist over middle-class
economies and national ist over liberal political
ideologies]{.underline}

### Soft Power Bad

#### Link - US soft power hegemony is an invisible violence that reproduces the militaristic/masculine/imperialist paradigm.

This paper aspires to [[consider the]{.underline}]{.mark} creation of a
[[strong nexus between media and America soft power in the hope of
examining how US global domination is animated by a homogenized
philosophy that rests on the premise of soft power.]{.underline}]{.mark}
The radical transition from the rhetoric of war and the [[binary
conceptualization of Manichaeism to the mediatized discourse of popular
culture sheds light on the pervasive role of media in reinvigorating and
legitimizing US soft imperialism.]{.underline}]{.mark} The articulation
of mediatized [[soft power by cultural icons masquerades as a faux
critique of virtual colonialism to alleviate the crippling legacy of
hard power]{.mark}]{.underline} or what has been known as George. W Bush
doctrine and thus to forge a new euphemism to circumscribe America\'s
hegemony. Following Gramscian parameters by treating culture as an
ambitious western project, [[mediatized American icons seem to be the
new art capable of reproducing US hegemony by tangling soft cultural
politics in a strategy of an invisible violence to reproduce the
paradigm coercion/attraction where hard power is supported by formidable
soft power reserves.]{.underline}]{.mark} This stage is, for instance,
epitomized by Hollywood movies as one of the most influential vectors of
America\'s soft power politics yet loaded with hegemonic narratives.

Introduction

[[The longing to achieve a global utopia with American traits shifts in
motives and emphasis as the coercive power of military intervention has
recently proved to be chaotic to US international
image.]{.underline}]{.mark} In the challenged atmosphere of the present
world order, it seems that Niccolò Machiavelli\'s discourse positing to
shield the continuance of a regime under the umbrella of coercion and
threat is unrealistic. In fact, [[the proliferation of media plays a
fundamental role in circulating and securing hegemonic ideological
representations of the west under the veil of popular culture. The
mediatized reinvigoration of soft power is aimed at rejecting the
crusading tones and style of America military exceptionalism as embodied
by George Bush during war times]{.mark}]{.underline} and therefore,
seeking new ways to cushion real hard power dynamics. As such, [[the
mitigating influences of soft power as encapsulated by popular cultural
icons have changed the narratives and interpretations concerning
Washington\'s political games.]{.underline}]{.mark} These include
Hollywood movies where the hidden articulation of virtual imperialism
masks the logic of America\'s expansionist empire so as to orchestrate a
new world order and to repackage foreign policies. [[As a greater
promoters and exporters of Americanism, these icons downplay the openly
violent discourse of war and military crusades as a blatant attack on
innocents;]{.underline}]{.mark} echo the core beliefs, vocabulary and
ideals of the soft power ideology yet serve the same aims of reproducing
and rearticulating \"western way of conceiving and perceiving the
world.\"1

Indeed, [[the emergence of a mediated culture is nothing but a
metamorphosis of US hard power into a soft version where the cultural
and political are backing up each other by ruthlessly defending the same
corporate interests and politics.]{.underline}]{.mark} While George Bush
crusades and Manichean speeches unleashed the messianic ideals of US
military power and sought to aggressively export and promote American
democracy, cultural icons sold through media lenses provide a similar
contextual framework for a new cultural doctrine. Longing to exploit and
empower US position, these icons have tremendously impacted on creating
an alternative to militarist and unilateralist agenda and thus
foreground the fundamental assumption that the American colonial
paradigm is taking on different colours. As such, the lofty rhetoric of
Hollywood movies enhances the vitality of soft power in an age where
direct brutal force is left with no room to thrive.

Therefore, [[this article will first highlight the plagued image of a
masculinised hegemonic America]{.underline}]{.mark} advocated by George
W. Bush missionary crusades [[and the decline of hard power
appeal.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[It attempts to present the Manichean
discourse of war as a threatened, endangered one no longer able to
sustain the supremacy of the US in world politics. Then, it will examine
the reinvigoration of US soft power as an ideology that strengthens the
correlation between cultural hegemony and soft
imperialism.]{.underline}]{.mark} Based on specific case studies, i will
show that Hollywood movies have become powerful demonstrations of soft
power as an integral part of US foreign policy. Though adhering to the
politics of soft powers, such movies are nothing but camouflages to the
horrendous power of direct physical destruction. Covertly or overtly,
Hollywood narratives boost thematic appropriations of western domination
where such discursive spaces are the new sites of an invisible violence.
Finally, the light will be spotted on the rise of counter powers to de
Americanize the soft power discourse and deepen it beyond its American
merit.

### US econ heg bad

#### **NOTE**

\*\*\* this dissertation is literal FIRE -- really good for possible US
Heg K -- something like US HEG = econ bad in east Asia/conflicts in east
Asia -- alt be something like accept a XYZ model of world governance
instead of US unipolarity -- could also be a good link to Cap K -- US
cap prolongs unipolarity -- unipolarity = conflict, entrapment,
encirclement -- just bring in those other disads as impacts
