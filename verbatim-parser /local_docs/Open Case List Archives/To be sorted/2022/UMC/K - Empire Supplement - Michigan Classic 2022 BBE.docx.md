A central argument of this book is that [[police are integral to our
conception of the modern state in ways both practical and
theoretical]{.mark}. In the practical sense, [police are the most direct
experience of government for many people]{.mark}. This is [evident
in]{.mark} places like Saddam Hussein's [Iraq, where]{.mark} the
[police]{.mark} were [used to directly carry out dictatorial commands
but is just as much the case in well-established constitutional
democracies like the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates,]{.underline} where
each year roughly one out every five citizens has face-to-face contact
with the police.1 [The modern democratic state famously has a monopoly
on the legitimate use of force, and the police are its certified
representatives wielding this legitimated force.]{.underline} Police are
where the rubber meets the road in terms of a significant amount of
government power, as [[which laws the police choose to emphasize and
which they choose to ignore]{.mark}]{.underline} (to say nothing of how
they enforce these laws) [[has]{.mark} a [far greater impact on]{.mark}
how the law [functions than]{.mark} do the [actual statutes]{.mark}
themselves.]{.underline}

[The police are also central to the ability of the state to garner
legitimacy and establish hegemony as a primary repository of social,
political, and physical power.]{.underline} This perspective builds off
the work of Gramsci, who argues the state is how a ruling class both
consolidates and, much more importantly, legitimizes its control through
"a combination of coercive force and intellectual-moral leadership."2
[However, [state legitimacy is not a static phenomenon; it must be
actively constructed and reproduced.]{.mark}]{.underline}

While the ruling classes of some states survive by outright repression,
[[democratic states vastly prefer **securing hegemony**]{.mark} through
the consent of the governed. Yet even within states that principally
earn their legitimacy through consent, there will [always]{.mark} be [a
need for coercive power to enforce discipline]{.mark} [on]{.mark} those
[groups who do not consent to state rule.]{.mark} In the modern state,
the [police are centrally responsible for this line between consent and
coercion.]{.mark}]{.underline}

For the police occupy much more than just a narrow law-enforcement role;
while this is part of their mandate and dominates public perception of
them, democratic police actually spend the majority of their time on
order maintenance and social service tasks, filling a wide variety of
roles.3 The ability of police to fulfill these many functions in a fair
and legitimate manner is a central factor in the strength of a democracy
and the quality of life enjoyed by its citizens.4 The failure on behalf
of those leading the reconstruction of Iraq to recognize the importance
of the many varied roles played by police in a constitutional democracy,
and the subsequent fragmentation of these roles to a wide variety of
public and private actors, has played a major part in the rise of
violent nonstate actors like the Islamic State, who have exploited their
ability to provide what the state and police currently cannot.

[[Ignoring]{.mark} the [many]{.mark} service and order maintenance
[functions police fill is but one of a litany of well-established
practices ignored by the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and coalition
authorities. Despite the extensive experience of the United States with
police reconstruction in postconflict and developing nations, those
responsible for police training in the new Iraqi state ignored nearly
all prior knowledge on the subject. Instead, they have opted for
creating the appearance of a legitimate police force, with [training
focusing almost exclusively on **self-presentational** matters]{.mark}
to]{.underline} the detriment of nearly anything police-related. [While
this "cultural performance" of policing may assuage short-terms concerns
of police capacity, the [lack of]{.mark} knowledge regarding policing
practices as well as the [human and civil rights guaranteed]{.mark} to
the populace by the new constitution means the police as constituted are
very unlikely to become the type of force needed for a democratic state,
something [confirmed by]{.mark} ongoing, **[widespread documentation of
corruption and brutality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.5

[This [lack of relevant police training is]{.mark} in no small part [due
to]{.mark} the u[nprecedented decision to place]{.mark} the
[reconstruction of the police under the]{.mark} auspices of [the
**D**]{.mark}**epartment [o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense**.]{.underline}
Treating police as part of the military not only departs from the long
history of democratic societies moving to divorce the two but
contradicts the scholarly consensus that treating the police as part of
the military "works against every principle of democratic policing."6
The DoD's approach to policing focused on force generation and questions
of equipment and capacity over the core aspects of policing, and the
coalition's own initial report on the status of Iraqi police forces
found them "better trained in counterinsurgency tactics than civilian
policing."7

[Although being led by the Department of Defense is unprecedented, the
[arming]{.mark} of a [police force to act as]{.mark} a
[counterinsurgency force]{.mark} is not. The [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates has [long used police training and reconstruction
programs to advance nation-building strategies that favor American
geopolitical concerns over those of the nation they are supposedly
helping]{.mark}]{.underline}. These programs have often minimized or
outright ignored crime control, order maintenance, and social service
functions in favor of developing intelligence networks oriented toward
countersubversion programs to create the internal security and order
necessary to implement larger political and economic plans. [As such,
[rather than establishing]{.mark} democratic order or [respect for human
and civil rights]{.mark}, these [police reconstruction programs]{.mark}
have [served **to modernize the repressive apparatus** in nations that
have served the interests of the United States]{.mark}]{.underline}.8

### Empire immigration

#### Multilateral operations solidify the existence of Empire -- globalized exchanges and dominance over nation states condition the biopolitical control of Empire

policies separating families, detaining them in concentration camps, and
shooting immigrants with impunity]{.underline}; Abramsky, 2019; Grandin,

other countries]{.underline}]{.mark} (Vossoughi et al., 2020)
[[augment]{.mark} a [pressing need]{.mark} for education scholars and
practitioners [to recognize]{.mark} one particular silenced history more
acutely: [the U.S. empire]{.mark}. I define U.S. empire1 as [a
nation-state that has devised a sociopolitical process for domination
beyond its settler-colonial borders through threats of military force
and/or interference in foreign nation-states for its own
benefit.]{.mark} Imperialism is an oppressive mechanism that irrupts
into people's lives, pressuring some to flee their homelands and become
immigrants, peoples of diaspora]{.underline} (Brah, 1996; J. González,
2011).2 In using the terms empire/imperialism, I refer to [the American
settler-colonial nation-state]{.underline} (Calderon, 2014; Coloma,
2013) as [[an oppressive force that also operates outside of its borders
and affects foreign populations---with dire consequences for the
Othered.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[It would be [difficult to deny that the United States]{.mark}, at one
time or another, [has acted in an imperialist manner. If empire
is]{.mark} defined as [the domination of one people by another state
separate and alien from it, then assuredly there have been episodes in
which one can speak confidently of an American
empire.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the 1830s an opponent of
~~Indian~~\[Indigenous\] removal, Congressman Henry Storrs, declared
that he would not sacrifice the reputation of America's founders, who
had counselled just treatment of the native inhabitants, 'for all the
~~Indian~~\[Indigenous\] lands that avarice ever dreamt of, and all the
empire which ambition ever coveted.' Of course he lost that argument.12
[[The Cherokee and other southern tribes were removed.]{.mark} So, too,
America undoubtedly acquired an empire in the war against Spain at the
end of the nineteenth century. The regeneration of [the Philippines and
the acquisition of]{.mark} protectorates over [various Caribbean islands
followed an imperialist script]{.mark}.]{.underline} 'Has it ever
occurred to you,' asked the Missionary Journal in 1899, 'that Jesus was
the most imperial of imperialists?'13 [[When facing peoples outside the
society of states]{.mark} (then European and Christian in character[),
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates did indeed [act]{.mark} so [as to
displace peoples in its path]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus far, then, those
who would insist on a long imperial pedigree for America are adducing
facts that cannot be denied. It is also true, however, that when America
faced towards Europe and the society of states, its message was avowedly
anti-imperial.

Several pertinent distinctions, moreover, are lost if the Bush Doctrine
is seen as simply the latest instalment in a long imperial project. If
it is true that there are precedents for an American imperialism, [it is
also true that [Bush raised]{.mark} the [empire business to an entirely
new leve]{.mark}l. At its core, [the Bush Doctrine proposed that the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates e[xtend]{.mark} the [position of military
domination that fell to it]{.mark} as a consequence of victory in the
Cold War; and that same doctrine was unafraid and unapologetic when it
came to using force to reshape the international system.]{.underline} In
embracing a doctrine of preventive war, the United States was abandoning
the policies of containment and deterrence that it had followed during
the Cold War. In announcing that it intended to preserve against all
rivals its pre- eminent military status, it was jettisoning its previous
commitment to arms control. [In its [insistence]{.mark} that [it would
no longer be bound by]{.mark} the [laws]{.mark} traditionally [governing
the use of force]{.mark} -- [laws that forbid preventive war, torture,
and the violent overthrow of regimes for the purpose of changing their
political form]{.mark} [-- the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [had come
to breathe a spirit of defiance towards international
law]{.mark}.]{.underline} Especially in the early years of the Bush
administration, America seemed recklessly indifferent to the views of
traditional allies and airily dismissed the importance of showing a
decent respect for the opinion of mankind.

[[In its pure form]{.mark}, as it were, the distilled essence of [the
Bush Doctrine was undoubtedly an imperial project]{.mark}]{.underline},
one that was far in advance of America's Cold War policy. It proposed a
mastery of the state system by one power that recalled what Schell
termed 'the hoary old nightmare of the ages, the always feared but never
realized project of universal empire.'14 [Whereas empire signifies the
domination of one people by another, [universal empire had traditionally
signified the domination by one power of the state system as a
whole.]{.mark}]{.underline} This vision could only really take root in
circumstances of unipolarity. In this regard, a new vista had opened
after the collapse of the Soviet Union that created an entirely
different milieu from that which existed during the Cold War. Those
observers (among both supporters and critics) who insisted that the Bush
Doctrine represented a revolutionary change in American policy were
closer to the mark than those who emphasized continuity.

### AT: Anthro Turn

#### Empire's concept of biopower and biopolitical control rests in a complex thesis centered around nature

**Lemke 11** - Professor of Sociology with specialization in
Biotechnologies, Nature and Society at the Faculty of Social Sciences at
Goethe University Frankfurt, (Thomas, \"Biopolitics,\" De Gruyter,
02-17-2011,

The concept of "biopolitical production" stands here for a dual trend of
capitalist socialization. It refers first of all to the dissolving of
divisions between economics and politics that denotes a new stage of
capitalist production. Here, in Hardt and Negri's view, the creation of
"life" is no longer something both limited to the realm of reproduction
and subordinated to the labor process; to the contrary, "life" now
determines production itself. Consequently, the difference between
repro- duction and production increasingly loses significance. If
biopower at one time stood for the reproduction of the relations of
production and served to secure and preserve them, today it is an
integral component of production. [[Empire is a "regime of
biopower"]{.mark} (2000, 41) [in which economic production and political
constitution tend to overlap.]{.mark} The consequence of this is a
wide-ranging convergence and parallelism between discourses and
practices that have traditionally been separated from one another but
that are now drawn into correlation:]{.underline}

Production becomes indistinguishable from reproduction; productive
forces merge with relations of production; [[constant capital tends to
be constituted and represented within variable capital, in the brains,
bodies, and cooperation of productive subjects]{.mark}. Social subjects
are at the same time producers and products of this unitary
machine.]{.underline} (2000, 385; see also 2004, 334--335)

Second, "[[biopolitical production" for Hardt and Negri]{.mark} also
[denotes]{.mark} a [new relationship between nature and culture. It
signifies a "civilization of nature]{.mark}]{.underline}" (2000, 187),
"nature" here meaning everything previously external to the production
process. Life itself becomes an object of technological intervention,
and nature "has become capital, or at least has become subject to
capital" (ibid., 32). [Biological resources are the object of
juridico-political regulation, while ["natural" processes are opened up
to commercial interests and potential industrial]{.mark}]{.underline}

use. [[Nature]{.mark} thus [becomes a part of economic discourse.
Instead of being simply about exploiting nature, the discussion in the
era of "sustainable" or "environmental capitalism" is about translating
the biological and genetic diversity of nature into economic growth and
opening it up to the development of profitable products and forms of
life]{.mark}]{.underline}: "Previous stages of the industrial revolution
introduced machine-made consumer goods and then machine-made machines,
but now we find ourselves confronted with machine-made raw materials and
foodstuffs---in short, machine-made nature and machine-made culture"
(ibid., 272).

[[Hardt and Negri see]{.mark} this double disappearance of demarcations
as the transition from the modern to the postmodern. [When economics and
politics and nature and culture converge, then there is no longer an
external standpoint of life or truth that might be opposed to
Empire.]{.mark}]{.underline} This diagnosis grounds the perspective of
immanence that underlies the authors' analysis. [[Empire creates the
world into which it unfolds]{.underline}:]{.mark}

[Biopower is a form of power that regulates social life from its
interior, following it, interpreting it, absorbing it, and
rearticulating it.]{.underline} Power can achieve an effective command
over the entire life of the population only when it becomes an integral,
vital function that every individual embraces and reactivates of his or
her own accord. (Ibid., 23--24)

[To the degree that the [imperial order not only rules over subjects
but]{.mark} also [generates them,]{.mark} [exploits nature but also
produces it]{.mark}, we are dealing with an "autopoietic
machine]{.underline}" (ibid., 34) that reverts to immanent
justifications and rationales that it creates itself. Owing to this new
[[biopolitical reality, it is no longer possible to uphold a dual
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark} that operates on the basis of binary
oppositions such as basis/superstructure, material reality/ideological
veil, and being/ consciousness.
