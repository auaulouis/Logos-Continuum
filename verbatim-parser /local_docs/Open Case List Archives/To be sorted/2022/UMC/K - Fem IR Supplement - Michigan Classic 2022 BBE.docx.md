How do these themes/categories and tools of inquiry work together to
depict the images of marginalized women and women in the developing
world? Putting these together with the seven building tasks,7 we can
gather how [[fem]{.mark}inist [I]{.mark}nternational [R]{.mark}elations
literature [has]{.mark} constructed and deconstructed the idea of the
"third world women" and [disrupted stereotypes]{.mark} and preconceived
images [of women around the world]{.mark}. The basic task of
[dismantling and decentering]{.mark} the current [theoretical paradigms
of mainstream IR by challenging its "western"
origins]{.mark}]{.underline} served as the foundation to call into
question the supposed objectivity of knowledge developed within the
boundaries of this discipline (Sign Systems, and Knowledge).
[[This]{.mark} ultimately [leads to deconstruction of the masculinities,
and consequently, the femininities derived from mainstream IR]{.mark},
which challenges the universalism of its principles. [These principles
are the basis]{.mark} [under]{.mark} [which knowledge is
disseminated]{.mark} within the field and they dominate the ways in
which we think about the world. [Thus, to deconstruct and challenge
these principles then "problematizes" all of the concepts and
practices]{.mark} derived from them.]{.underline} When considering how
feminist IR challenged and problematized development, this served as the
basis for the building tasks of practices and politics. While
international relations and the international system advocate for
development as benevolent, in practice, this concept has been enacted
(at times) with various self-interested outcomes by those in positions
of power. Tickner pointedly referred to development as a "western
project" and other theorists critiqued the western frame of development
models and practices. [Furthermore, if one thinks about the politics of
development, [this concept is]{.mark} complexly [used to withhold social
goods such as foreign aid or development assistance]{.mark}. The
buildings tasks of relationships, identities, and connections are
closely intertwined and dependent upon each other, especially in
[feminist]{.mark} [IR]{.mark}. The literature also [challenged,
developed, and weaved together the various aspects of identity]{.mark}
of women around the world.]{.underline} Challenging the views of women
in the developing world also involved challenging how women in the
developed world view their own status and position. Take, for example,
the concepts of complicity and insider/outsider identities. The feminist
IR literature strongly asserted that through actions such as underpaid
household labor or unfair labor practices used to produce
globally-shipped goods (e.g. buying items produced in sweatshops) women
have participated in aspects of patriarchy that disadvantage others.
[[Another]{.mark} [example is]{.mark} "femocrats" or [women in power who
condone]{.mark}---or even advocate---certain poli[cies that are steeped
in hegemonic masculinity]{.mark}, such as war. These are women that have
upheld certain aspects of patriarchy because it is beneficial to
maintaining their own power. Thus, it forces women in the developed
world to think about their relationship and connection to their
counterparts in developing countries, particularly in ways that do not
create them as abstract figures. [If these women are oppre]{.mark}ssed,
if they are "third world"; if they are disadvantaged, th[en, those in
the "first world" are not disconnected from their position.]{.mark} This
oppression did not---and does not---happen by coincidence.]{.underline}
Women in the First World/developed countries/Global North bear some
responsibility, whether implicitly or explicitly, in maintaining the
disadvantaged social status of those outside the west. Furthermore, an
interesting aspect of this analysis of feminist IR literature was not in
how these pieces talked about women in developing countries or the
"Third World," but in how these women weren't spoken about. [Not in
terms of making them invisible, but in not attempting to describe them;
not attempting to speak for them, but straying away from one-dimensional
or homogenized views of their lives. It seemed that [the goal was simply
to "trouble" the existing images and ways in which we think
about]{.mark} these [women and their lives]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
task was not necessarily to describe, but instead, to deconstruct.
[Perhaps, [this was a method to counter]{.mark} existing, [problematic
narratives]{.mark}, but [without co-opting the stories of marginalized
women]{.mark} for scholarly purposes. The previously identified themes
and categories will be carried forward to the second part of the
discourse analysis on policy literature]{.underline}. The purpose of the
next chapter is to see if any of these objects in feminist IR literature
have influenced and/or appear in the discourse of international women's
development policy. Summary When looking at the overall discourse of
feminist IR literature, the not only stresses the idea of adding women
to IR, but which women are added and whose voices are heard. [[This is
disruptive to the discipline because of its agendered
assumptions]{.mark}. The texts repeatedly and purposefully situate
gender and international relations within a western context, to serve as
a reminder that the international system has a specific sociocultural
frame. [This creates situated identities within this frame that may have
been imposed upon individuals, particularly women in the "Third
World"/]{.mark} "Developing" world/ "Global South." By giving examples
of women's agency, particularly in reference to women's movements and
civil society, [it serves to uncover and build an image of these women
separate from "western]{.mark}" created [concepts]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Often, images of marginalized individuals are depicted in relation to
those in power, highlighting the (hierarchical) differences. Telling a
plurality of stories decenters the singular frame in which one can see
the world. [[Despite these attempts at disruption, the use of
dichotomies shows the power of language and that one can only exist so
far "outside the system"]{.mark} (even when aware of its pitfalls). This
"discursive slippage" is a result of unconscious, habitual, and
inherited language (Hooper, 2001; Runyan & Peterson, 2010). [The
continued use of western-imposed, hierarchical dichotomies means that
uncovering new ways to view i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations
[requires new language]{.mark} to speak about international
relations.]{.underline} Otherwise, feminist IR will disrupt discourse in
one context, while entrenching it in another.

This paper argues for [[the utility of a feminist security
theory]{.mark} (FST) that is developed from the intersection of feminism
and the transnational security agenda. Theoretical lacunae exist in the
security field because [feminist theory is often granted only peripheral
prioritization or no priority at all.]{.mark} FST is necessitated by the
[IR community's]{.mark} ~~anemic~~ [subpar effort to appropriate
academic space to the nexus of security]{.mark} and
feminism.]{.underline} These gaps in policy and discourse have begun to
shrink, because "[[FST has subverted]{.mark}, expanded, and enriched
[notions of security" by questioning "the]{.mark} supposed [nonexistence
and irrelevance of women in international security politics]{.mark}," as
well as "the extent to which women are secured by state 'protection' in
times of war and peace."]{.underline}15 Within the nexus of feminist
theory and a transnational security agenda, [[the dichotomy between
traditional state security and]{.mark} newer notions of [human security
creates an]{.mark} evident [aperture in feminist rhetoric and]{.mark}
[practiced]{.mark} security [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Heidi Hudson
describes her feminist perspective of the politics of security, stating:
Today, more than ever, human security coexists uneasily with security.
[Since [the]{.mark} analytical [potential of feminist epistemology
cannot b]{.mark}e [divorced from its political and transformative value,
a critical feminist perspective on]{.mark} the study of
[security]{.mark}, and especially human security, [is crucial]{.mark} to
overcome certain gender silences. [Feminist critiques of so-called
natural]{.mark} or depoliticized [gender dichotomies within
state-centric discourse delegitimize discriminatory practices]{.mark}
and institutions as socio-historical constructions and 'repoliticize'
orthodox views of security by challenging the role of the state as
provider of security. [Gender is intrinsic to the subject matter and
politics of security]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}16 [A [critical
gender lens is imperative in identifying]{.mark} the [power
disparities]{.mark} that threaten women's peace and security, which may
otherwise go undetected or unchallenged by mainstream IR analysis. [In
the absence of feminist deconstruction, the gendered natures of war,
peace, and security may not be exposed]{.mark} and recognized [as
products of the inherently gendered societies]{.mark} within which they
occur. Without exposing this cycle, peace and security are compromised
for all]{.underline}. Blanchard identifies "the functions of feminist
scholarship in any disciplinary intervention---the critique of existing
theory, the reconceptualization of core concepts, and the expansion of
empirical knowledge."17 [[It is not until realism's assumptions about
security are countered]{.mark} by feminism's inclination to question the
root of all assumptions [that the biases inhibiting inclusive security
can be]{.mark} identified and [expunged]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
disjunction in discourse and policy has emerged as a result of the
incongruity between mainstream IR approaches to state security and
feminist approaches to human security. [I argue that [advocacy efforts
for human security,]{.mark} such as the security of women in war, are
annulled and objectives [are misrepresented when conducted in]{.mark}
political institutions grounded in state security. This is due to [the
differences in how insecurities are perceived]{.mark} by proponents of
human security and by bodies that are mandated to protect state security
and interests.]{.underline} The utility of a security theory that
employs a feminist lens rests in its keen dismissal of the status quo.
[[The essence of realism--- focusing on "what is" and not "what should
be"---implies a dedication to status quo maintenance]{.mark}. Realists
accept the international structures in existence under the assumption
that what exists is unequivocally normative. [Security, as it is
interpreted by IR policymakers, suggests the necessary return to the
status quo]{.mark} following a deviation from the norm. That which is
deemed "insecure" is classified as such by its perceived
abnormality---and thus its threat to the status quo. Therefore, [the
"task of feminist analysis---rendering the familiar strange, in this
case by problematizing the naturalness of 'security'"]{.mark} instigates
scrutiny of classifications of security and insecurity]{.underline}.18
If states protect women during war from insecurity (identified as
abnormal harms), what does that imply about states' recognition of the
daily harms occurring in times of peace that have been normalized within
the contexts of a patriarchal society? [I have illustrated the backdrop
of realism and security studies to contextualize the framework within
which feminist theory strives to broaden traditional security discourse.
Through an array of reviewed literature, I have contextualized two
theories to war, peace, and security: the mainstream realist approach
focused on state security and the peripheral feminist approach
interested in human security. [By challenging the assumptions of
realism, feminists problematize the status quo and question patriarchal
structures to demand "where are the women?]{.mark}"]{.underline} Some
scholars have argued for the necessary merger of the two theories into a
feminist security theory to effectively address and combat the
insecurities threatening peace and propagating conflict. [[Rethinking
security with a feminist lens creates new analytical tools]{.mark} to
assess existing policies in determining who is intended to receive
protection from state-sanctioned security measures? Furthermore, from
which insecurities are they protected?]{.underline}

#### Without embracing vulnerability and a new way of thinking about the political, the postwar condition recreates nationalistic violence and hegemonic sovereign power

[[Feminist IR has drawn attention to bodies]{.mark} such as Kaisu's in
the literature [where the role of women's corporeality in symbolising
the nation]{.mark} and its honour [is studied]{.mark}, particularly in
times of violence and war.26 The abject figures of, for example,
'[comfort women']{.mark} who [have been subjected to nationalistic
violence]{.mark} and 'female terrorists and torturers' taking part
themselves in violence and war have been also brought to the research
agenda of feminist IR]{.underline}. 27 Recently, Christine Sylvester's
War as Experience: Contributions from International Relations and
Feminist Analysis28 has opened up a new domain for the study of violence
and war as a corporeal and a mundane phenomenon. [She suggests that [war
should be studied as an institution whose actual mission is to injure
the human body]{.mark} and destroy normal patterns of interaction. [Due
to the overtly abstract notion of war in IR starting with
states]{.mark}, organisations, fundamentalists, security issues and
weapons systems, [ordinary people and their bodies are overwhelmingly
absent in IR]{.mark} and its studies of violence and war, and
consequently of postwar peace too.]{.underline}29 Sylvester's view
resonates with Julia Kristeva's quest for research that seeks concrete
instances of 'women's time'. [[This]{.mark} type of [research emerges
from lived experiences and]{.mark}, thereby, [can reveal alternative
temporalities]{.mark} not heard in mass media or politics.30 Kaisu is
certainly an ordinary person and yet she does more than could be
expected from the 'ordinary': her performance and temporality disrupt
and destabilise, and as such, stand as guarantee for the reconfiguring
of the space of the political.]{.underline} Kaisu's speech act as such
does not constitute the political contestation. Rather, the contestation
comes forth through an ensemble of performance at a moment when there is
an 'opening' in the national historiography.31 In short, she exemplifies
Sylvester's point on the importance and unexpectedness of the mundane
and corporeal in relation to war and to postwar national identity
politics as well as Kristeva's notion of alternative temporalities that
rupture linear 'normal' time. To understand the ways Kaisu has
symbolically functioned as an abject who has not been 'taken into
account' 32 and how her narrative brings an anxiety to the core of the
imagined unitary postwar Finnish nation, [this article derives from the
[psychoanalytically oriented IR]{.mark} that [examines the]{.mark}
[nexus between war and collective identity, memory, and
history]{.mark}]{.underline}.33 [In this vein of thought, [war and
violence]{.mark} [are seen to be a constitutive and, at the same time,
traumatic]{.mark} event in the nation's existence as it reveals the
instability of the sovereign subject that was thought to provide
security.]{.underline} Jenny Edkins argues that sovereign power cannot
provide full security for its members. Instead, it sends individuals to
their deaths in the name of the survival of the collective self. It is
in this sense, that war and violence constitute a trauma in the nation's
existence: they reveal the unstable nature of sovereign power as a
security provider. 34 [The [postwar]{.mark} moment that follows the war
and violence [is a potential moment of social disintegration]{.mark}, in
which the cohesive power of the ideology that has created the nation's
identity as the primary security provider loses its efficiency. In Jenny
Edkin's words, this is 'trauma time' when nothing is certain and no
decision is assured.]{.underline}35 In a similar vein, Peter Burgess
summarises the characteristics of the national subject during this
moment by arguing that 'the subject is, ... unstable, exposed,
threatened and at risk'. 36 [Hence, [a new]{.mark} master [narrative is
needed to stabilise the identity of the sovereign power]{.mark} and to
make the war and the collective trauma readable for the national
subjects. Postwar memory work is of primary importance when the mastery
of the postwar anxiety is created and its collective effects are
controlled. [Since the nation's identity is rendered extremely
truncated, impossible, mutilated, and antagonistic during the war,
collective memory work]{.mark}, and particularly history writing,
[functions as a tool to cement a closure]{.mark}. National history works
to secure for a contingent nation the false unity of the national
subject evolving through time.]{.underline} According to Prasenjit
Duara, 'the subject of History is a metaphysical unity devised to
address the aporias in the experience of linear time'. 37 [Furthermore,
as a number of scholars have pointed out, [the way in which wars are
remembered and war]{.mark} history written is [fundamental to the
production and reproduction of postwar sovereign political
power]{.mark}.38 By 2010, when Kaisu told her story, the Finnish nation
had largely sedimented a master narrative of its post-Second World War
national history and location in world politics]{.underline}.39 By
coincidence, in the same year postwar 'abject history' got some official
recognition when the Prime Minister's Office and the National Archives
of Finland commissioned a study on the children of foreign soldiers in
Finland. It was the first officially initiated attempt to deal with the
question of children fathered by foreign soldiers, and consequently the
relations between Finnish women and foreign armies. However, Kaisu's
public appearance carried more historical weight than the officially
commissioned report40 that was published a year later as her performance
exposed her as a living container of residual historical material whose
subaltern past made visible the disjuncture with the present view of the
national self.

#### They can't perm- our poststructuralist feminism rejects the use of the state as a diluting factor to our radical politics.

OR

#### The TVA is illegitimate -- it relies on the structures of liberal feminism and state apology. We reject the use of the state -- it legitimizes hegemonic masculinity and reframes the state as our "protector".

[Having argued that the core focus and methodology of the liberal
feminist study of IR are gendered through a critique from the
poststructural feminist lens, this section argues that the means by
which [liberal feminism studies IR also has consequences for the
practice of IR]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, in highlighting the
consequences of the liberal feminist study of IR on the practice of IR,
this essay contends that the practice of IR is also inherently
political. Drawing back on the liberal feminist claims analysed in the
previous section, it is clear that [[liberal feminism]{.mark} wrongfully
[assumes that in utilising a positivist framework to study the
subordination of women objective knowledge is produced]{.mark}. However,
the knowledge that is produced by the popular liberal feminist analysis
of IR does have a significant influence on the practice of IR
specifically for the way that equality is defined and
achieved]{.underline}. If the liberal feminist methodology of studying
gender oppression is by examining their rights under the law then
liberal feminism is actively producing individualist knowledge (Baehr,
2013). The liberal understanding of individualism is best described by
John Stuart Mill who stated that \"over his own body and mind, the
individual is sovereign\" (Mill, 1859:13). [When this definition is
applied to feminism it becomes clear that [the goals of liberal
feminism]{.mark} are that which [emphasise the right of the
individual]{.mark} such as, equality under the law, personal autonomy,
freedom from discrimination from the state on the basis of gender and/or
sex, etc.]{.underline} [Thus, liberal feminism makes the assumption that
the individual exists freely from its social condition. [This]{.mark}
liberal feminist [understanding of the individual is rejected by
poststructural feminism]{.mark}, as the poststructural feminist
standpoint would argue that [there is no such thing as the \"fundamental
or essential self, but instead, \'we speak ourselves into existence
within the terms of available discourses\']{.mark}]{.underline} (Davies,
2000a, p. 55)\" (Barrett, 2005:83). [Thus, the poststructural feminist
understanding of the relationship between the individual and discourse
breaks down the liberal feminist notion of agency and autonomy,
contending that the individual is a socially constructed phenomenon and
every \'self\' comes from and is defined by various
discourses]{.underline} (Ibid:83). [However, poststructural feminism
does recognise some level of autonomy in recognising that [the
individual can control the discourses they are defined by and take up
discourses that \"disrupt hegemonic cultural narratives\" in order to
turn against the structures that produced them]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Ibid:87). The opposing understanding of the significance of the
individual between poststructural and liberal feminism highlights the
political nature of knowledge produced by liberal feminism. Liberal
feminism attempts to apply the Enlightenment concept of the \"autonomous
rational individual as a universal model of selfhood and starting point
for political action\" (Hooper, 2001). However, this concept disregards
the fact that [the female subject has been defined and constructed in an
opposing manner to the male subject, thus the Enlightenment model is one
that was constructed for a specific subject. Ultimately it is this
disregard that not only defines the liberal feminist practice of
achieving equality but the crux of the poststructural feminist critique
on liberal feminism, as [the liberal feminist commitment to the
Enlightenment, manifests in a way that makes the practice blind to the
politics of the very institutions it supposes will extend autonomy to
deserving individuals]{.mark}. Therefore, in applying the poststructural
feminist lens to the liberal feminist understanding of the individual,
it becomes clear that liberal feminism has limited its practice to a
constructed reality that overlooks the actual political needs of the
female subject by wrongfully equating it to the male
subject.]{.underline} The State Having investigated the effect of
liberal feminist knowledge on the practice of liberal feminism within
IR, via its political goals and conception of the individual, this essay
now turns to the liberal feminist understanding of the state. Thus, this
section argues that [[by applying the poststructural feminist lens it
becomes clear that the liberal feminist understanding of the state is
one that is riddled with political and gendered knowledge]{.mark}
specifically through the role of the state as a \'protector\'. As has
been previously shown, the liberal feminist understanding of the state
is that its role is to protect its citizens from coercive interference
by protecting their rights both domestically and internationally from
other states]{.underline} (Baehr, 2013). However, the liberal feminist
understanding of the state as a \'protector\' is a masculine
understanding of international relations that applies gender binaries to
the international stage in order to excuse non-cooperative behaviour. In
her book, Gender in International Relations: Feminist Perspectives on
Achieving Global Security, Judith Tickner analyses the feminist
perspective on security arguing that the \"security-seeking behaviour of
states is described in gendered terms\'\' that ultimately impacts the
practice of IR (1992:49). According to Tickner, [[states legitimise
their security-seeking behaviour by appealing to \"masculine
hegemony\"]{.mark}, by which the state takes on the paternal role of
\'protector\' in order to justify violence]{.underline} (Ibid:49).
[Furthermore, Tickner highlights that [in order to further legitimise
security-seeking behaviour states utilise the ideology of the family in
order to invoke a sense of community within the state so that there is a
perception of national identity and community that needs
protecting]{.mark} (Ibid:54). While Tickner takes on the broader
feminist critique of popular understandings of security and the role of
the state on the international stage, her critique is full of
poststructural insights that highlight the cracks in the liberal
feminist logic and the politics of its knowledge]{.underline}. Firstly,
focusing on Tickner\'s claim that the state is described as a
\'protector\', many different things come to light. While [liberal
feminism is a feminist theory it differs from the majority of other
feminist theories by critiquing who is involved in what processes rather
than criticising the knowledge produced by popular IR theories.
Therefore, [liberal feminism follows the same popular logic that the
state is a protector]{.mark}. The poststructural feminist understanding
of binaries highlights that the protector/protected binary utilised when
describing the state is a part of the larger masculine/feminine binary
that plagues IR. [This description of the state as a \'protector\' not
only feminises the domestic by describing it as incapable of
self-preservation but delegitimises notions of peace]{.mark} by
favouring the idea of \'protection\' as it insinuates that peace is a
naive ideal.]{.underline} Secondly, the process of a national identity
drawing upon the ideology of family is one riddled with gender binaries
that further delegitimises domestic politics. The state is both feminine
and masculine. The home base for a state is the family/the feminine,
whereas the state in IR is the action/the masculine. [The separation of
the state\'s public and private spheres into masculine and feminine
descriptors highlights the power of language within discourses of IR as
[the liberal feminist description of the state, which it supposes to be
neutral, is in fact not only gendered but actively devalues the
feminine]{.mark} in order to maintain the current status quo of state
behaviour.]{.underline} In all, by applying the poststructural feminist
lens to the liberal feminist understanding of the state\'s role as a
\'protector\' the argument that knowledge production is always
inherently political in the study and conduct of IR is further supported
by uncovering the gendered nature of the liberal conception of the
state. Conclusion In conclusion, while this essay recognises that
poststructural feminism itself has no stance on the politics of
knowledge production in the study and conduct of IR, [poststructuralism
still offers a valuable methodology by which political meaning can be
uncovered. Thus, [by utilising poststructuralism alongside feminism it
becomes clear that the liberal feminist way of producing
knowledge]{.mark} in the study and conduct within IR is inherently
political as it [is both based in and perpetuates a larger gender
discourse]{.mark} within IR that has consequences. By adopting the
poststructural feminist stance in order to critique liberal feminist
notions of knowledge production, this essay analysed the foundations of
liberalism and poststructuralism, the role of feminism with each theory
respectively and then used the poststructural feminist lens in order to
problematise the knowledge that liberal feminism has produced and
legitimised on objectivity within IR and the consequences that knowledge
has on the knowledge produced around concepts of the individual and the
state. [This investigation]{.mark}, in turn, [revealed the underlying
power dynamics within said structures and the way that gender within IR
functions as a tool of not only oppression but
legitimisation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, with this in mind, it
remains the claim of this essay that the process of knowledge production
is always inherently political in the conduct and study of IR

India is a land where Mahatma Gandhi and his ideas of non-violence were
born, but it is also the land where Mahatma Gandhi was assassin by Godse
for preaching 'Feminine' 'non-violent' politics and for making Indian
men less 'manly' by promoting peace[. [Masculinity is a social]{.mark}
[definition given to men]{.mark} and boys in society, [it is associated
with strong]{.mark}, powerful, brave, and macho
[characteristics]{.mark}. The understanding of security is limited for
many years in international relations (IR) and hence the understanding
of a secured state is associated with a leader who has masculine
characteristics capable of handling security. [Politics across the world
is understood in the terms of power and strength]{.mark} of the leader
[and other masculine characteristics]{.mark} associated with being
'manly' enough to control a state. While [feminine characteristics are
associated with weak]{.mark}, soft, and gentle [behavior]{.mark}, even
[when women are elected as leaders, they are expected to hold]{.mark}
strong [manly characters]{.mark} to stay in politics.]{.underline}
Indira Gandhi, the first female prime minister of India, prefer being
addressed herself as 'sir' and her policies did not include a gender
perspective. In Gender, Justice and the Wars in Iraq (2006), Laura
Sjoberg demonstrates that women's presumed status as innocent civilians
make wars harder, not easier, for them, by defining them as protected
without regard for their actual safety. On Iraq's economic sanctions,
[[feminist insights from]{.mark} the study of [economic
sanctions]{.mark} as the war in international relations [are]{.mark} not
only [valuable for their contribution to IR's theories of
sanctions]{.mark}, but also for their generalizability to IR's crucial
questions, such as what constitutes foreign policy, what counts as war,
and how war affects people [Feminists]{.mark} [see]{.mark} that [war and
military are]{.mark} often [threats to women's]{.mark} and other
vulnerable groups' [security]{.mark} as they are competitors for scarce
resources during and after a war on which women may depend more than
men, [instead of seeing military power as part of a state's defense
against security threats]{.mark} from other states, it should be seen as
a product of patriarchy. [The large defense spending]{.mark} on soldiers
and military weapons [rather than creating a safe society for
women]{.mark} at home or spending on climate action that could create
safer lives for women [is]{.mark} an example of [a masculine approach to
war]{.mark}.]{.underline} The feminist approach in IR demonstrates how
the security of individuals is related to national and international
politics and how international politics impacts the security of
individuals even at the local level. [[IR feminist theories focus on
social relations through gendered lens,rather than power
relations]{.mark} or anarchy, they see an international system
constituted by socially constructed and gender hierarchies [that
contribute to gender subordination]{.mark} rather than traditional
understanding of security.]{.underline} In 2019 In the Lok Sabha
elections of India, Narendra Modi, and his party used his 56-inch chest
in the election campaign to associate his capability of handling the
security of India with 'manly' characteristics. While more than 3 lakhs
of children die due to starvation in India every year, the Indian prime
minister wins elections by boasting about his 56-inch chest capable of
defeating terrorists. Feminists believe that the social construction of
masculine characteristics is reflected in politics especially in IR
because political theory and practice are both dominated by men. [[The
understanding of war and violence is also associated with men,
it]{.mark} [praises soldiers]{.mark}, diplomats, and leaders [that
promote protection from war]{.mark}. Modern Enlightenment science has
incorporated a belief system that equates objectivity with masculinity
and a set of cultural values that simultaneously elevates what is
defined as scientific and what is defined as masculine. [The
western]{.mark} liberal and [realist understanding of
masculinity]{.mark} and politics [are limited and discriminatory towards
women]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the world is facing nationalism wave
in politics, leaders like Narendra Modi, Donald Trump and Putin promote
a masculine idea of Security in the world to protect their national
interest and secure nation through military expansion. The understanding
of security, war, and politics are interlinked in creating the foreign
policy of a country. In a country like India, the United States, or
Russia where leaders promote masculine characters through their election
campaigns, where the state controls the reproductive decisions of women,
or in a country like India where weapons are worshiped, the foreign
policy and politics of the state are influenced by masculine characters
and are valued for national security. Rape, domestic violence,
[[harassment]{.mark} [against women in their own country is not
subjected to war]{.mark} but a traditional understanding of the war in
IR as feminists have pointed out is as if women require protection
during war and soldiers are fighting to protect the honor of women, in
reality[, it is often women's protectors (men) who provide the greatest
threat in everyday life]{.mark}.]{.underline} For feminist scholars, a
security that is global and multidimensional with political, economic,
and ecological facets that are as important as its military dimensions.
[[The security of individual]{.mark}s and their natural environment [is
considered as much as the security of the state. National security needs
to be inclusive of security of all from security threats such as]{.mark}
domestic violence,]{.underline} rape, [poverty, [gender
subordination]{.mark}, and ecological destruction as well as
war.]{.underline} For example, Sweden has a feminist foreign policy,
which means the understanding of security is through a gendered lens,
feminist foreign policy not only broadens what security means but also
who is guaranteed security in the world. [While [feminism is a new
approach of though in IR,]{.mark} the case study of Sweden explains the
importance of [feminist foreign policy that believes in gender
equality]{.mark} in decision making, [promoting peace and does not
promote masculine characteristics associated with war]{.mark} and use of
force in foreign policy and makes secure, happier nations. While the
discourse of security is dominated by masculine characteristics in IR,
states can be secured with wider perspective of human security
associated with gendered lens.]{.underline}
