**[[Governments in Poland and Hungary]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- U.S.
allies and members of NATO and the European Union --- [**[continue to
pursue policies that are fundamentally at odds with]{.mark}** healthy
**[democratic development]{.mark}**]{.underline} and that marginalize
some of their most vulnerable communities. Outsiders have lumped the
phenomena in Poland and Hungary together, but that glosses over some
important differences between the two countries and possible approaches
to their situations. [In Hungary, changes to electoral law and
deteriorating economic and political institutions put the country in a
precarious place, compounded by the government's cooperation with other
nondemocratic regimes. Poland has maintained its strategic alignment
with the United States and economic integrity, but its domestic politics
and social policies are worrisome.]{.underline} Both governments were
democratically elected and earned a legitimate mandate to rule from
their populations. Both governments also assert that external actors
should keep out of their domestic affairs. Nevertheless, as an ally and
active promoter of democracy in the region, the United States must find
a way to head off decline. Through diplomatic pressure, the incoming
administration should strongly advocate minority rights and support
regional civil society. With other partners, such as the EU and NATO,
the United States should establish democratic expectations and make it
clear to the Polish and Hungarian governments that accountable
governance through rule of law and democratic norms is the key to
stability and partnership. INTRODUCTION In 2020, covid-19 swept through
the globe, causing a public health and economic crisis. To offset the
economic fallout, the European Union set up a recovery fund. There was a
hitch: the European Commission would hand out money from the fund only
to members that demonstrated respect for the rule of law, a condition
that EU leaders had for years been seeking to link to other funding
disbursements. This stipulation targeted primarily Poland and Hungary,
which then blocked approval of the EU budget and recovery fund. Refusing
to back down, the EU threatened to cut Hungary and Poland out of the
covid fund if the gridlock was not
resolved.[^1^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_0_7801)
The commission was not alone: Majorities in all European countries,
including Poland and Hungary, support the principle of tying EU funds to
respect for the rule of
law.[^2^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_1_7801)
In the resulting compromise, the EU Parliament passed the rule of law
conditionality, but the EU Commission had to make several concessions on
language, scope, and
enforcement.[^3^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_2_7801)
This flurry of political developments is the culmination of years of
accusations that governments in Poland and Hungary are pursuing domestic
policies at odds with their democratic mandate, resulting in a great
deal of head-scratching about how outside parties should respond.
Earlier in 2020, Freedom House downgraded the most democracies ever in
its 25 years of compiling the **[Nations in Transit]{.underline}**
report. Poland and Hungary stood out as the worst examples of democratic
decline.[^4^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_3_7801)
Critics have accused Hungary's Fidesz-led government, which came to
leadership in 2010 under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, of consolidating
power by undermining independent media and the judiciary, changing
election laws, and facilitating
corruption.[^5^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_4_7801)
In Poland, the Law and Justice-led coalition (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość,
styled "PiS") has drawn criticism throughout its five years in power,
especially for its changes to the judiciary, which the EU and other
critics say undermine the rule of law and violate the principles of EU
membership.[^6^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_5_7801)
The PiS and Fidesz governments defend their policies as
necessary.[^7^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_6_7801)
Domestically, both parties' focus on economic development and social
spending have won them a mandate to rule, especially from rural
voters.[^8^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_7_7801)
The charge that democracy in Poland and Hungary is deteriorating is
serious and has prompted calls for intervention. As a bilateral ally,
NATO member, and promoter of democracy in the region, the United States
has an important role to play in addressing challenges to the rule of
law and its consequences for democracy. This paper argues that Poland
and Hungary are pursuing policies that erode the rule of law and
democratic norms. It also argues there are key differences between the
two countries, all of which put Hungary on a more worrying trajectory.
The United States should maintain its role as an active promoter of
democracy in the region and continue to advocate minority rights,
support civil society, and stress to the Polish and Hungarian
governments that accountable governance through rule of law and
democratic norms is the key to stability and partnership. To do this,
[**[the United States should lead with diplomacy and set the conditions
that will safeguard its relationships in]{.mark}** central and eastern
**[Europe,]{.mark}** a region that still matters for the United States'
strategic interests.]{.underline} In this report, Section 1 will explain
the spectrum of concepts and definitions applied to the domestic
situations in Poland and Hungary. Section 2 provides an account of each
country's recent domestic developments. Section 3 gives broader context
for attacks on the rule of law and backsliding. Section 4 notes
differences between Poland and Hungary. Section 5 offers a discussion on
policy options, makes recommendations, and concludes. SECTION 1. TERMS
Experts debate what to call the situation in Poland and Hungary, and its
causes.[^9^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_8_7801)
Some call it
backsliding.[^10^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_9_7801)
Others call it a "playbook of autocracy" or "autocrat\'s
playbook."[^11^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_10_7801)
Still, others consider it a mere hiccup not indicative of a lasting
deviation from the countries' prior trajectories: All democracies have
occasional problems, and Poland and Hungary are not swerving off
democratic
course.[^12^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_11_7801)
Even the concept of democracy is complex and encompasses a spectrum of
systems.[^13^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_12_7801)
Populism and backsliding are separate phenomena that feed off each
other.[^14^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_13_7801)
Populism enables a party or political formation's path to power;
backsliding is the way that power is wielded and maintained through
twisting proper governing
mechanisms.[^15^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_14_7801)
Populist rhetoric provides a narrative of **[why]{.underline}** for the
ruling party --- why the country is in danger; why the party is the only
hope for salvation and ought to be voted into power; why governing
mechanisms need to be altered. Backsliding is **[how]{.underline}**
those ruling parties stay in power. It is the sum of measures taken to
ensure that the power structures are still secure in favor of the ruling
party even if the electorate has a change of heart or stops believing
the narrative. Related to this, one prevailing explanation for
populism's success is a divided and/or weakened
opposition.[^16^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_15_7801)
The opposition's weakness could in turn be due to the lack of a
compelling platform, infighting, or the power of the majority party's
simplistic narrative (especially if it taps into aspects of the
electorate's
identity).[^17^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_16_7801)
The rise of populism and concerns over the deterioration of democratic
institutions are not unique to Hungary and Poland. Other EU members, and
indeed countries around the world, are experiencing these problems to
some
degree.[^18^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_17_7801)
Ironically, growing illiberalism elsewhere helps the Polish and
Hungarian governments claim that the "West" and "Western media" are
singling them out --- a convenient narrative. SECTION 2. COUNTRY

over the domestic politics of Hungary and Poland date back to the early

offender.[^19^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_18_7801)
Now, Hungary has taken the lead, with Poland's government allegedly
mimicking the Hungarian government's methods to keep a grip on
power.[^20^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_19_7801)
A summary of developments in the two countries over the past decade
shows similarities, but also some striking differences that ought to be
noted in assessments and subsequent policy
responses.[^21^](https://cepa.org/what-can-we-do-about-poland-and-hungary/#footnote_20_7801)
Sketching out events in each country also helps avoid the tendency to
draw overly simplistic caricatures. While some comparison can yield
valuable insights, if we rely too much on this approach, we risk
overlooking some of the nuances specific to each country. \<Section
2.1-2.3 5.1 and 3.2 excluded for irrelevance and length\> POLICY
RECOMMENDATIONS Considering the above, U.S. should adopt a cautious and
considered approach in addressing concerns over perceived backsliding in
Hungary and Poland. The PiS and Fidesz governments were elected
democratically, and they represent a sizable number of Polish and
Hungarian citizens. Some recent developments in both countries are
undoubtedly problematic, but to call foul on the legitimacy of their
governments is unwarranted: It's important to not treat them like fully
authoritarian regimes. Advocates of softer measures would steer away
from material threats in favor of more political finesse, vocal
diplomatic pressure, and institutional weight. The actions of Poland and
Hungary come nowhere close to those of countries that have economic or
targeted personal sanctions leveled against them, such as Russia, Iran,
and North Korea. The United States must maintain influence to address
key U.S. interests in the region, allowing strategic objectives to drive
its diplomatic priorities while keeping its focus on engaging in areas
it can influence. U.S. policymakers can do this by adopting a tandem of
internal and external measures. 5.2.1. INTERNAL The United States should
establish formal tools to measure the impact of its regional stance on
rule of law and threats to democracy. So far, **[U.S. policymakers have
reacted to crises or developments in Poland and Hungary on an ad hoc
basis.]{.underline}** They have relied on external meters to diagnose
the problem and have rushed to do damage control (or not). Instead, the
United States should establish its own benchmarks or metrics to gauge
whether developments in Poland and Hungary (and any ally facing
rule-of-law issues) are impeding strategic objectives, alongside a plan
to reassess the U.S. response when Poland and Hungary take measures in
line with U.S. goals. Such measurements and **[procedures would offer
stability, consistency, and transparency to regional partners and
clarify the U.S. role in encouraging democratic practices and
safeguarding strategic goals in Poland and Hungary.]{.underline}**
**[[The United States should take a harder line toward Hungary's and
Poland's transgressions, imposing consequences for violations of the
rule of law. The]{.mark} incoming [administration should make it clear
that]{.mark} high-level visits, [bilateral cooperation,]{.mark} economic
support, and other benefits [will depend on]{.mark} meaningful [changes
in Polish and Hungarian behavior and policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At
the same time, the United States must reassure Poland and Hungary that
despite domestic woes, it would defend them against an external threat.
In official and unofficial meetings, the United States should press
Poland and Hungary on actions that threaten the rule of law or
democratic norms, especially laws that restrict the rights of minorities
or limit freedom of the press. The United States should encourage
greater social freedoms where possible, modeling adherence to the rule
of law, political decency, and democratic pluralism at home. The United
States should not condition its military aid or weapons sales --- vital
to U.S. interests in the region --- on successful domestic political
reforms or EU dialogue. But a loosely connected approach could create an
incentive potent enough for the governments in Warsaw and Budapest to
sit up and take note. For example, the United States could privately
insist on serious, good-faith efforts to revisit certain domestic
developments, particularly in the judiciary, civil society, and media,
as part of returning to the shared values under which Poland and Hungary
came to benefit from a U.S. troop presence along NATO's eastern border.
The United States should support a vigorous and well-funded civil
society in the region. The United States has made an enormous difference
in central and eastern Europe not with military might or arms sales, but
through diplomacy and support for the organizations and people who
create democracy. It should return to these people-to-people methods
with funding, training, and teaching and learning opportunities for
Polish and Hungarian NGOs and civil society, including English- and
regional-language NGOs, which inform an ever-wider audience.

height="7.638888888888889e-3in"} U.S. Vice President Joe Biden addresses
to media after meeting Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski in Warsaw
March 18, 2014. 5.2.2. EXTERNAL There are compelling reasons to push for
a regional approach to democratic development. An aggressive diplomatic
push to bring local actors into a regional dialogue could help realize
democratic objectives. The United States must work with allies and
partners to keep Hungary and Poland from further degrading the rule of
law and to encourage the governments in Warsaw and Budapest to cooperate
in addressing shared democratic concerns. The United States can use its
considerable influence to push for a structured dialogue within NATO ---
alone or with support from other members --- that explores democratic
norms and the safeguarding of democracy. Indeed, a U.S. troop presence
in the eastern flank offers more leverage to shape security and
political outcomes. Even a "failed" discussion could offer a framework
for future talks and, later, arrangements. If dialogue proves difficult,
the United States could focus the conversations on responding to shared
security threats, such as Russian revanchism or the effects of Chinese
economic power. In parallel, the United States could use diplomatic
power to support a regional EU-based discussion track. Piggybacking off
the NATO discussion, the United States could facilitate a regional
dialogue on issues of rule of law and democratic norms. Such
conversations would not require any new institution or official bi- or
multilateral declarations. Like the NATO conversations, these dialogues
would be open-minded and flexible, and focused on getting many interests
and players at the table. Some conversations would be best held with
U.S. support but with no U.S. representation --- to ensure that EU
countries feel they are properly representing their regional interests.
Other conversations could include envoys from Washington. Still others
might include players outside the region, such as Russia and China.
Currently, the more the elites in Brussels push, the more the Polish and
Hungarian administrations decry an external EU "threat" in order to
legitimize their power grabs, but adding the United States as a broker
alongside the EU to facilitate these conversations might wear down
Poland and Hungary's rhetoric. Dialing back the heat, even a bit, among
Poland, Hungary, and the EU would be conducive to creating structures
for future progress. In addition to this, the United States and other
regional partners should use Poland and Hungary's desire for power and
prestige within international organizations to leverage for reform. Both
countries would need to feel they had something to gain by behaving in
line with the norms of those institutions and that they have a
legitimate opportunity to wield influence within such organizations.
More broadly, the United States needs to be more consistent in its
policy toward the transatlantic space. This means not fracturing the EU
or threatening the integrity of the alliance. Lack of predictable U.S.
policy in central and eastern Europe, and indeed the EU, breeds
uncertainty among allies and partners, which encourages them to act in
ways counter to U.S. policy objectives, including hedging. This is
particularly true in Hungary, which has cultivated close relationships
with the governments in Beijing and maintained a close relationship with
Putin's Russia. [**[The United States can expect Orbán to continue to
deepen ties with China and Russia]{.mark}**, which is strategically
smart, but it should use diplomatic ties to remind Orbán of Hungary's
enduring and important relationship with the United States. Hungary may
seek diplomatic alternatives in Russia or trade and investment in China,
but these are not truly credible alternatives to security and
intelligence partnerships with the United States]{.underline}. At the
same time, the United States should consider not getting too close to
the government in Budapest, whose continued threats to the rule of law
will likely undermine its long-term stability and which could
increasingly turn to Russia and China for aid. This move away from
Budapest might give the government in Warsaw pause, as it sees itself as
promoting Western values, in tandem with the United States, in its
foreign policy. Both Russia and China have incentives to maintain or
exacerbate the current divide between central and eastern Europe on the
one hand and the European Union and United States on the other. China
poses a lesser threat than Russia to the de facto territorial integrity
of countries like Poland and Hungary, but China throws its weight and
money around in ways that could further erode democratic norms. At the
same time, when considering its relationship with Poland and Hungary,
the United States should avoid over-emphasizing its geopolitical
competition with China and Russia. At this point, Poland is firmly in
the "Western" camp. But countries like Poland and Hungary are encouraged
by the economic opportunities China provides, and they should not be
forced to choose between the United States and "others." The United
States should be mindful of Russian and Chinese activity in the region
but should avoid treating it as moves in a zero-sum game. China and
Russia still have largely transactional relationships with Hungary:
Russian activity continues to focus on projection of power, and China is
focused on sowing economic accord through investment, but the government
in Beijing has not seemed eager to dive into domestic politics outside
of the political pressure necessary to ensure its own ends. Finally,
because the United States is facing some of the same domestic issues as
Poland and Hungary, it has an opportunity to speak to the two CEE
countries peer-to-peer. Common experience could be a starting point for
recommitting to values underlying a healthy democracy. President Biden's
remark at an October 2020 town hall lumping Poland and Hungary in with
Belarus as "totalitarian" is not conducive to a constructive dialogue.
Indeed, Biden's victory has gotten a frosty greeting in Poland and
Hungary (as opposed to other Western countries), as the two countries
anticipate the shift in strategy from the incoming U.S. government. But
the Biden Administration could echo the dialogue of healing and return
to civility --- which it has used domestically --- in addressing such
topics on the transatlantic space and bi-lateral ties. 5.3 CONCLUSION A
more constructive approach to Poland and Hungary is essential for
sustainable democratic development and U.S. interests in the CEE region.
**[[A successful strategy will require resilient diplomacy]{.mark}
backed by rhetoric that reinforces stability rather than provoking
confrontation. With this in mind, [the United States should not shrink
away from calling out its allies on their]{.mark} more [egregious
policies]{.mark} that harm the region's most vulnerable communities.
[The focus must be on keeping Poland and Hungary from decline while
encouraging cooperation on shared goals.]{.mark} As a part of this, the
United States should bring in the EU and NATO members to uphold
democratic norms. [Managing the transatlantic relationship --- of which
Hungary and Poland are a vital part]{.mark} --- is a long-term project
that [can only succeed through]{.mark} pluralism, open dialogue, and [a
shared set of values and objectives. ]{.mark}]{.underline}**

On June 6, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Órban visited a small town on
the Hungarian-Slovak border to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the
signing of the Treaty of Trianon. The agreement, signed in the wake of
World War I, dramatically shrunk Hungary's territory from its
Austro-Hungarian empire borders, resulting in Hungary ceding two-thirds
of its territory and leaving sizable populations of ethnic Hungarians
outside of the new boundaries. In [his
speech](http://abouthungary.hu/speeches-and-remarks/primeminister-viktor-orbans-commemoration-speech-trianon/),
which was imbued with nationalist resentment[, [Órban described every
Hungarian]{.underline}]{.mark} [child inside and outside of the
country's borders as [a "guard]{.mark} post" [to protect national
identity]{.mark}. Additionally, he boasted about the speed at which
Hungary has increased defense spending and built "a new army,"
proclaiming, "We haven't been this strong in a hundred
years."]{.underline}

[**[Órban's]{.mark}** deliberately [provocative]{.mark} and threatening
[speech]{.mark} was not a nationalist dog whistle intended only for the
Hungarian public. Rather, it directly **[suggested]{.mark}** that a
significant amount of territory belonging to Hungary's
**[neighbors]{.mark}** to the east---**Romania, Slovakia, and
Ukraine**---[**should be** considered
**Hungarian**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Órban's rhetoric]{.mark}---[and Hungary's]{.mark} **rapidly
[backsliding]{.mark} democracy**---[should serve as a wake-up]{.mark}
call [to]{.mark} the [\[NATO\]]{.mark}North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.]{.underline} Today, the alliance faces a growing and
pernicious threat: the rise of illiberal nationalism within its ranks.
This internal threat is one that an alliance built on cooperation of
individual nation-states and premised on states working together is
ill-suited to address. For instance, NATO has been encouraging member
states to [devote more
resources](https://www.nato-pa.int/download-file?filename=sites/default/files/2018-12/2018%20-%20BURDEN%20SHARING%20NEW%20COMMITMENTS%20IN%20A%20NEW%20ERA%20-%20MESTERHAZY%20REPORT%20-%20170%20DSCTC%2018%20E%20rev1%20fin.pdf) to
national defense. However, this begs the question of whether the
alliance should encourage an autocratic Hungary to massively increase
its defense spending when it could use its military capabilities to
threaten its neighbors. With Turkey [stoking
tension](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/08/11/world/europe/ap-eu-greece-turkey.html) with
Greece in the eastern Mediterranean, leading to fears of conflict
between two NATO members, the internal threat of nationalism to NATO's
cohesion is clear. It is time for the NATO alliance to get serious about
the threat posed by rising nationalism and democratic backsliding among
its member states.

A backsliding Hungary

[Over the past decade, the [Órban]{.mark} regime has relentlessly
[attacked Hungarian democracy]{.mark}. Today, Freedom
House [maintains](https://freedomhouse.org/country/hungary/nations-transit/2020) that,
given the government's tight control over the media and independent
institutions, [Hungary]{.mark} can [no longer]{.mark} be considered [a
democracy]{.mark}. [During]{.mark} the [COVID]{.mark}-19 pandemic,
[Órban]{.mark} has taken on emergency powers that allow him to rule by
decree, [[further
consolidating](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/europe/hungary-coronavirus-orban.html) his
power]{.mark} over the government. This descent into
**[authoritarianism]{.mark}** has also gone [hand in hand with]{.mark}
the regime's efforts to **inflame Hungarian [nationalism]{.mark}** and
provoke confrontation with Hungary's neighbors.]{.underline}

Órban has followed
a [tactic](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/one-million-passports-putin-has-weaponized-citizenship-in-occupied-eastern-ukraine/) employed
by Russia, wherein President Vladimir Putin issued passports to Russian
populations outside of their borders. In 2011, Órban similarly expanded
Hungary's citizenship laws, issuing passports to ethnic Hungarians in
surrounding countries. And while Órban has made it exceedingly difficult
for Hungarians who have moved abroad to vote, Hungarian minorities in
surrounding countries have become a major base of support for the Órban
government. For instance, in the Romanian region of Transylvania, there
are [1.2
million](https://balkaninsight.com/2020/01/30/living-like-in-hungary-orban-bankrolling-romania-ethnic-parallelism/#:~:text=Transylvania%20is%20home%20to%20the,ethnic%20minority%20communities%20in%20Europe.) ethnic
Hungarians, making it one of the largest ethnic minority populations in
Europe. This has created what Tamás Kiss, a researcher at the Romanian
Institute for Research on National
Minorities, [described](https://balkaninsight.com/2020/01/30/living-like-in-hungary-orban-bankrolling-romania-ethnic-parallelism/) as
a system of "ethnic parallelism -- to build up and maintain a system in
which Hungarians can live their life as it would be not in Romania but
in Hungary." Using local proxies in ethnic Hungarian communities in
Slovenia, Serbia, Slovakia, Ukraine, and Romania, Órban has pumped money
into Hungarian-centric media and cultural programs. Akos Keller-Alant, a
Hungarian
journalist, [describes](https://balkaninsight.com/2020/01/30/living-like-in-hungary-orban-bankrolling-romania-ethnic-parallelism/) this
strategy as a way to pursue "the 'virtual unification' of all
Hungarians," including by making it "easier for them to gain Hungarian
citizenship."

Meanwhile, [[**tensions** with]{.mark} Hungary's [neighbors
have [**grown**](https://www.romaniajournal.ro/politics/hungary-accuses-president-iohannis-of-inciting-to-hatred-following-statements-on-szeklerland-autonomy-law-mae-szijjarto-diverted-iohannis-message/)]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The Órban regime has been quick to [stoke
resentment](https://balkaninsight.com/2020/02/12/slovak-election-to-test-orbans-clout-among-ethnic-hungarians/) over
various perceived slights---both real and imagined---within Hungarian
minority populations. This, in turn, has provoked a backlash among
Hungary's neighbors, exacerbating tensions and increasing anti-Hungarian
sentiment. This gives the Órban regime a nationalist dial, so to speak,
to aggravate territorial grievances whenever it chooses. With the
upheaval and uncertainty caused by COVID-19, the ability to distract the
nation from the government's response to the pandemic would likely
become increasingly politically appealing.

Hungary's revanchist allies

[While ethnic conflict is not a new feature of central European
politics, several factors---including Hungary's rapid military
modernization and [growing relationships with Russia and
China]{.mark}---[make Órban's]{.mark} increasing nationalistic
[posture]{.mark} and rhetoric [more troubling.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Órban is not just stirring the nationalist pot. Hungary's movement away
from democracy and embrace of autocratic illiberalism has helped the
country foster closer relationships with Russia and China. Russian
intelligence has greatly expanded its presence in the
country, [allegedly](https://www.reuters.com/article/hungary-russia-senators/u-s-senators-see-security-threat-in-russian-banks-move-to-budapest-idUSL5N26H3LO) using
Hungary as a back door to the European Union. Meanwhile, China has built
up its economic and political connections to Budapest, with
a [major](https://www.eias.org/briefing-papers/the-bri-in-europe-and-the-budapest-belgrade-railway-link/) Belt
and Road Initiative project linking the Hungarian capital to Belgrade.
Ultimately, these sorts of actions benefit all involved parties: Hungary
builds economic and political ties with Russia and China, while Russia
and China get the opportunity to not only build ties with a fellow
illiberal regime but also potentially undermine the cohesion of the EU
and NATO.

[Additionally, both [**Russia and China** provide a revanchist **model**
for Hungary]{.mark} to follow. Russia seized **Crimea**, invaded eastern
**Ukraine**, and continues to dispute regions of **Georgia** under the
guise of protecting ethnic Russian populations. China, for its part, has

However outlandish Hungary's territorial claims, similar actions

Hungary rearms

Hungary has been considered a solid NATO partner since it [became a
member](https://www.nato.int/docu/comm/1999/9904-wsh/pres-eng/03acce.pdf) of
the alliance in 1999. Today, it has troops in Kosovo and Afghanistan and
contributes to the Baltic air policing mission. Meanwhile, its defense
spending has remained low, amounting to just [1.22
percent](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex) of the country's gross
domestic product in 2019.

However, [Hungarian [**defense** spending]{.mark} has significantly
**[accelerated]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with a major focus on force
modernization. In its 2020 national budget, [Hungary
is [expected](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-nato/hungary-aims-to-reach-nato-defense-spending-goal-in-2023-idUSKBN1XU2HF) to
**increase** its defense **spending by 20 percent**,]{.underline} for a
total defense budget of 616 billion forints, or \$2.1 billion. Hungary
is [on
track](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-nato/hungary-aims-to-reach-nato-defense-spending-goal-in-2023-idUSKBN1XU2HF) to
reach the goal of 2 percent defense spending by 2023. Much of the
defense budget increase has occurred since the beginning of the Trump
administration, with Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó
emphasizing President Donald
Trump's [call](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/27/politics/trump-nato-contribution-nato/index.html) for
European countries to ensure their own security.

Hungary
is [purchasing](https://sites.tufts.edu/corruptarmsdeals/gripen-combat-aircraft-sales-to-the-czech-republic-and-hungary/) Saab
Gripen fighters to replace its aging Soviet fighters. In addition, it is
modernizing its helicopter
fleet, [acquiring](https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2019/11/hungary-takes-delivery-of-its-first-two-h145ms.html) 20
light tactical H145M helicopters from Airbus, and has expanded its
ground capabilities through the acquisition of American Humvees, German
tanks, and modern howitzers. Hungary is also seeking to expand its
ground forces and expand youth recruitment to military programs. Hungary
has also prioritized what it terms its "territorial defense"
capabilities, or using the military to [patrol the country's
borders](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37259857) since the
migrant crisis of 2015. The Órban regime is [planning
on](http://abouthungary.hu/news-in-brief/hungarian-government-to-double-number-of-soldiers-patrolling-the-borders/) doubling
the number of soldiers at the borders in 2020, despite the fact the
migrant flows through Hungary have essentially stopped.

To be clear, the military balance between Hungary and its neighbors is
not favorable for Hungary. It is highly unlikely that Órban fanning the
flames of nationalism will turn into a full-on inferno, with demands for
territorial revisions and war. Yet the mere potential for such a
dystopian future---and the possibility for outside agitators to
encourage such an outcome---should lead both NATO and the EU to take
action to snuff out those embers.

From a NATO alliance perspective, the presence of an illiberal member
whose leader stokes ethnic and national tension with its neighbors and
spends significant sums modernizing its forces should be concerning.
While the notion that allies embedded in an alliance could take arms
against each other may seem far-fetched, history says otherwise. In
1940, during World War II, Hungary regained the region of Transylvania
from Romania. At the time, both nations were allies as part of the Axis
powers. What is more,
Romania [contemplated](https://balkaninsight.com/2020/03/20/when-romania-flirted-with-a-fate-like-yugoslavias/) going
to war against its Axis "ally" following the assumed defeat of the
Soviet Union. It is not out of the realm of possibility that similar
intra-alliance divisions could arise today.

Rethinking the 2 percent defense spending goal

For NATO, it should be clear that the political character of each of its
member states matters a great deal to the security of all members and to
the effectiveness of the alliance. NATO needs to become a democratic
alliance again.

[To that end, the [United States]{.mark}, [the EU]{.mark}, [and European
states]{.mark} with significant **influence** on Hungary, namely
Germany, **[could step in]{.mark}** to exert their considerable
leverage. However, short of evicting illiberal members from the
alliance---which is both complicated and immensely controversial---[NATO
should]{.mark} seek to [deepen integration]{.mark} and limit the
potential for unilateral action by expanding greater cross-border
regional and pan-European defense integration.]{.underline} By way of
example, in 1952, Germany and
France [created](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM%3Axy0022) the
European Coal and Steel Community, merging the industries needed to wage
war into a supranational structure that no single state controlled.
Similarly, the challenge posed by the revival of European nationalism
should lead to efforts to integrate European defense acquisitions and
military forces as much as possible. This should not be considered a
short-term effort but rather a long-term endeavor to blunt and diminish
underlying historical antagonisms.

NATO should also undertake and encourage initiatives that integrate
force and promote joint acquisitions, which is already happening on a
limited level in Western Europe. For instance, Danish sailors serve on
German naval vessels, and Belgium and the Netherlands have [joint naval
capabilities](https://english.defensie.nl/topics/international-cooperation/other-countries/the-belgian-and-netherlands-navies-under-1-command).
NATO has also expanded initiatives to foster joint acquisitions,
including a \$20 million precision-guided
munitions [purchase](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_157687.htm?selectedLocale=en) involving
11 allied partners and
the [establishment](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_111830.htm) of
permanent joint intelligence capabilities. NATO should encourage central
and Eastern European countries to undertake similar efforts and should
try to create incentives for such cooperation.

Additionally, NATO should encourage more defense spending at the EU
level. This entails re-imagining the 2 percent defense [spending
pledge](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/14/politics/nato-defense-spending-target/index.html) as
not only an investment in national military forces but also in
collective European defense. While Europeans do need to invest more in
defense, this no longer needs to be done just through the European
nation state, especially because the EU's involvement in defense is no
longer a third rail for European integration. In a recent poll, [nearly
80 percent of European
publics](https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep06814) were in favor of a
common EU defense policy. Similarly, European citizens are growing more
comfortable with the power of the EU to solve complex multinational
issues. When COVID-19 hit Italy, for example, Italian leaders turned to
the EU much in the same way that a U.S. state hit by a natural disaster
would turn to the federal government for assistance.

Furthermore, current European spending is extremely inefficient, leads
to immense duplication and waste, hinders interoperability of forces,
and contributes to Europe punching well below its geopolitical weight.
For [example,](https://qz.com/1004687/eu-army-europe-dreams-of-a-common-military-but-has-too-many-types-of-tanks/) Europe
has 17 types of battle tank systems and an estimated 178 separate types
of weapons systems. While any prospect for the creation of a so-called
EU army is a long way off, the gradual development of EU capabilities or
of military capabilities developed under EU auspices should be
integrated into NATO's efforts and planning. Instead of worrying
about [duplicating](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1463/MR1463.ch6.pdf) NATO
efforts, the United States and NATO should seek to leverage the EU's
powers of integration. The events of the past few years have made this
more important than ever.

[[Encouraging defense integration]{.mark} at the bilateral, regional,
and EU levels [provides a path forward]{.mark} to deal with increasingly
nationalist NATO members. In doing so, **NATO can mitigate** the threat
of nationalism in member states such as Hungary by entangling and
integrating their militaries to such a degree that nationalist agitation
remains strictly rhetorical.]{.underline}

[The renewed interplay of [nationalism and authoritarianism should
raise]{.mark} real [concerns within NATO]{.mark}. Preventing Europe from
descending into a destructive cycle of nationalist conflict was, after
all, a major driver for the formation of the NATO alliance and the
impetus for the European integration project. With the threat of
democratic backsliding and nationalist aggression rearing its ugly head
once more, [NATO must respond]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### [Democracy]{.underline} in Hungary is [in shambles]{.underline} and future is not bright- [must act now]{.underline}.

threats to democracy both at home and abroad through the lens of theory,

Backsliding,\" Democratic Erosion,
<https://www.democratic-erosion.com/2022/04/20/viktor-orbans-hungary-a-democracy-backsliding/>

With the end of the Cold War and fall of the Soviet Union in 1989, the
political systems of eastern Europe began to undergo massive change. As
countries transitioned away from the communist regimes of the past, many
nations opted to lay foundations for democracy. Hungary was one of those
countries and embodied a young, stable democracy for three decades[.
However, in the time since 2010, [**Hungary's** democratic state]{.mark}
has [**weakened** **substantially**.]{.mark} A prime factor in the
Hungarian democracy's backsliding is the actions of Prime Minister
Viktor **[Orbán]{.mark}** and his right-wing party, Fidesz. Orbán and
Fidesz [represent **autocratic** **leadership**]{.mark} with stark
**nationalist** attitudes, and a demonstrated dedication to
**anti**-**immigration** policies. Alongside that, the two entities have
[dismantled core democratic institutions]{.mark} and have [produced
unfree]{.mark} and unfair [elections]{.mark}. The tactics deployed by
Orbán and Fidesz are [exceedingly worrisome,]{.mark} not only [for
Hungarian freedom]{.mark} but for the [**dangerous** **example**]{.mark}
they set [for]{.mark} the other young [democracies of the
world]{.mark}.]{.underline} 

[Orbán's lack of political forbearance in the abuse of Hungary's
constitution has greatly contributed to Hungarian democracy's
decline]{.underline}. Forbearance is commonly recognized as
self-restraint in the exercise of power. [[Orbán]{.mark} has
[rewritten]{.mark} several components of [the constitution]{.mark} in
recent years, allowing him to [secure more power]{.mark} [for
himself]{.mark} and his party.]{.underline} Upon the widespread firing
of civil servants, Orbán installed members of his own party to aid in
blurring the lines between state government and Fidesz. Another
corrosive action has been the expansion of Hungary's constitutional
courts, the body responsible for overseeing the
fairness/constitutionality of parliamentary acts. Orbán [packed the
courts](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/13/17823488/hungary-democracy-authoritarianism-trump) with
Fidesz loyalists who then neglected to call out his authoritarian ways.
He also gerrymandered parliamentary districts to break up the
anti-Fidesz vote amongst the electorate. None of Orbán's constitutional
actions are illegal, but they all are extremely corrosive to democracy.
A central component of a strong democracy is a respect for democracy
itself. Forbearance is a respect for democracy, and [Orbán's **[lack of
forbearance]{.mark}** has proven [detrimental to Hungary's]{.mark}
democratic [future]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Another one of the major ways in which **[Orbán]{.mark}** has
[eroded]{.mark} Hungarian [democracy]{.mark} is his **assault**
[on]{.mark} the **free [media]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A free media plays
a pivotal role in any strong, healthy democracy, because it equips the
electorate with the information needed to make an informed, fair-sided
choice. Hungary's free media has crumbled as Orbán has launched attacks
on the institution. Opposition voices have been nearly silenced as
Fidesz overwhelms Hungarian citizens with Fidesz's own message and
propaganda. Since 2017,  Fidesz or Fidesz allies have owned over 90% of
Hungarian media. When a democracy experiences a blurring of lines
between one party and the state itself, it becomes increasingly hard to
distinguish between the two entities and their respective power. Orbán
and Fidesz have too strong a grip on the media for an informed
electorate to be present. This situation erodes democracy as the
opposition fails to expand its supporters through open, publicized
information. Unfortunately, this same media situation has been exhibited
in other countries that have fallen to authoritarian rule, such as
Venezuela. Similar to Orbán, [Hugo
Chávez](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-media-and-the-citizen-in-venezuela) of
Venezuela was democratically elected and subsequently infiltrated and
attacked the free media, contributing to his authoritarian takeover of
the South American country.    

[[Orbán]{.mark} and Fidesz have also [employed tactics to
**manipulate**]{.mark} their **[opposition]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In
recent years, Fidesz has created several [fake political
partie](https://www.occrp.org/en/blog/9019-fake-parties-real-money-hungary-s-bogus-party-problem)s
that do not pursue electoral victory, but strive only to break-up the
anti-Fidesz vote. This move by Fidesz to fragment the electorate depicts
the party's continued lack of political forbearance. However, the
creation of up to fourteen fake political parties may not hold the same
legality as Orbán's other anti-democratic tactics. Fidesz is currently
being investigated for electoral fraud, but the investigation is
unlikely to yield any consequences for the autocrat due to his previous
packing of the courts. This failure of the system is representative of
the worsening democratic situation in Hungary, with once constitutional
checks on power now useless in a time of critical need.  

The passage of a "[voter
tourism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/06/orban-fidesz-autocratic-hungary-illiberal-democracy/)"
law that now allows Hungarians to register to vote in any parliamentary
district of their choosing has furthered Orbán's assault on democracy.
This law significantly stiffles Orbán opposition as Fidesz supporters
strategically shift their votes into electorally closer districts in an
attempt to ensure a Fidesz loyalist victory. In a healthy democracy, one
possessive of free and fair elections, no such policy would take shape.
The rules of the game would not be altered to benefit the current
holders of political power and an opposition as large as the one present
in Hungary would not experience such a lack of parliamentary seats.
Prior to Orbán's rise to power, this law would appear unconscionable,
but when an autocrat with no respect for democratic values or
forbearance is in office, it comes as no surprise that the opposition
faces an increasingly difficult battle for power. 

Hungary just held elections in April of 2022 and Orbán and Fidesz
unsurprisingly remained in power. As explained, [[Hungary's democracy
is]{.mark} currently [in shambles]{.mark} and the democratic [**future**
does **not** appear **bright**]{.mark}. In the grand scheme of Hungary's
history, the almost complete [**erosion** of democracy]{.mark} has
[materialized in]{.mark} an [exceptionally **short**]{.mark} **period of
[time]{.mark}**. As the freedom of the Hungarian people continues to
deteriorate, an even more alarming threat looms over the international
community--the [threat of]{.mark} Viktor [Orbán]{.mark} and Fidesz's
[playbook]{.mark} [being]{.mark} exported and [implemented in
other]{.mark} democratic [states]{.mark}. As the world watches the
ongoing situation in Hungary, it is [important to recognize]{.mark} his
[autocratic tactics]{.mark} as full-on assaults on democracy and work
[to prevent similar democratic backsliding]{.mark} from happening
elsewhere.]{.underline}

Even if overshadowed by the ongoing Russian aggression against Ukraine,
[Viktor [Orbán's recent landslide victory]{.mark} in the Hungarian
parliamentary elections [was]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n important [**turning
point** for the Western world's democratic
credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The implications of Orbán winning a fourth consecutive term as prime
minister and a fresh constitutional supermajority for his Fidesz party,
even in the face of a united opposition this time, will be far-reaching.
[[Hungary's Western partners]{.mark} must draw the right
[lessons]{.mark} from a historical juncture that has further [cemented
Hungary's path of autocratization]{.mark}]{.underline}, alongside
similarly disturbing trends in the region in Poland.

In the 12 years Orbán has been in office, [Hungary has evolved into a
unique laboratory of autocratization within the Western
world]{.underline}. [[The lessons]{.mark} learned from the country's
authoritarian developments help to explain how]{.underline} competitive
authoritarian regimes flourish and operate within the framework of the
European Union, how the tilted playing field that such regimes create
[can]{.mark} impact political competition, and whether -- and if so, how
[--- a domestic democratic [correct]{.mark}ion of [advanced
autocratization]{.mark} is feasible]{.underline} at all.

The Systemic Challenge of Autocratization

[[Despite]{.mark} the [Biden]{.mark} administration's effort to begin
[challenging **democratic backsliding**]{.mark} and the EU's tentative
recent efforts to push back on Hungary and Poland's autocratization,
[the Hungarian election result confirms]{.mark} that Central Europe's
[illiberal regimes]{.mark} are no temporary phenomena at
all]{.underline}. Rather, they pose a systemic challenge to pluralist,
liberal democracy by labelling themselves non-liberal, but democratic,
and they will remain with us for years, if not decades. The result
creates a long-term challenge to the democratic integrity of the
transatlantic alliance.

In 2026, when the next parliamentary elections will be due in Hungary
and Orbán will be in power for 16 years, there will be a full
generational cohort of young Hungarians who once again got their
political socialization in a non-democratic regime, lacking direct
experience with liberal democracy. This, and the en masse emigration of
politically dissatisfied Hungarians will keep the chances of a future
democratic backlash against the Orbán regime rather low.

Of course, Hungary is not the only serious challenge to democracy in
Central Europe. While Hungary's autocratization pattern is different
from that of Poland, their similarities are undisputable. For one, in
both cases, the demise of the rule of law, the undermining of judicial
independence, the hollowing out of constitutional checks and balances,
and attacks on media pluralism appear to be inextricably bound with
compromised election integrity.

[[This]{.mark} year's [Hungarian election was]{.mark} its third
consecutive vote since 2014]{.underline}, when the incumbent Fidesz
party enjoyed "undue advantage," according to the assessment of the
election observation mission of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). As the OSCE observation mission concluded
this year: "the 3 April parliamentary elections and referendum were
\[...\] [[marred by]{.mark} [the **absence** of a level playing
field]{.mark}]{.underline}. \[...\] the campaign was highly negative in
tone and characterized by a pervasive overlap between the ruling
coalition and the government," this latter referring to the development
of Fidesz evolving to a kind of "state party" and Hungary becoming a
"party-state."

This language is similar to the OSCE assessment of the 2020 Polish
presidential elections, in which, according to the organization, "the
campaign was characterized by negative and intolerant rhetoric further
polarizing an already adversarial political environment. In an evidently
polarized and biased media landscape, the public broadcaster failed to
ensure balanced and impartial coverage, and rather served as campaign
tool for the incumbent." Poland's autocratization will reach its key
juncture at the 2023 general elections. If the regime of Jaroslaw
Kaczynski and his Law and Justice (PiS) party will also succeed in
further entrenching their position, a successful re-democratization of
Central Europe would seem to be unrealistic in the short- and mid-term.

[[Orbán's landslide victory]{.mark} this time [was a stunning
surprise]{.mark}]{.underline}, the reasons for which will keep Hungarian
political analysts busy for a while. [[No public opinion poll predicted
the collapse of electoral support]{.mark}]{.underline} behind the
opposition, although Hungarian polls traditionally have been fairly
accurate.

The united opposition organized a rather weak campaign with a couple of
unforced errors, but this was hardly the main reason behind the
opposition's defeat. They followed a strategy that appeared to be right
both in light of the Hungarian electoral system and the lessons learned
from the 2019 municipal elections. That time, voters urged the full
cooperation of democratic opposition parties. This time, voters,
especially those of the former radical-right party Jobbik, abandoned the
joint list of the six opposition parties in significant numbers. What
happened?

The uneven playing field was a key factor in the opposition's loss. The
incumbent Fidesz party's dominance of the media landscape, along with
campaign rules allowing its candidates to outspend their opponents
several times over, provided far more than a tactical advantage of a
couple of percentage points, but rather a strategic advantage that
fundamentally altered the nature of political competition. Fighting an
uphill battle in public communications, the opposition was unable to
deliver its messages outside of its core electorate. Furthermore, the
war in Ukraine became the key campaign issue, and Fidesz was successful
in labelling opposition candidate Péter Márki-Zay and the six parties
supporting him as warmongers and traitors who would be ready to risk
Hungary's economic and physical security in order to provide military
help to Ukraine. The bottom line is that, while political competition
may exist in Hungary in legal terms, the country's political system is
de facto skewed to bar any opposition victory in elections.

[[This situation can only change if the **credibility** of the
government's communications suffers a severe
setback]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example due to the increasing mismatch
between the reality of citizens' lives and the government's narrative.
In short, only a domestic crisis of the Orbán regime may open real
opportunities for the opposition to challenge him with any hope of
success.

War in Ukraine Masks Authoritarian Trajectory

The Hungarian-Polish political alignment has gone slightly off course in
the face of Russia's all-out war on Ukraine, as Orbán has maintained his
pro-Russian foreign policy and reluctance to provide meaningful aid to
Ukraine, while Poland's historical enmity with Russia has prompted it to
vigorously support Ukraine and take in almost 3 million refugees fleeing
the fighting. But the authoritarian core of the two regimes remains
unchanged. While rightly celebrated in the international media for its
committed leadership in supporting Ukraine's self-defense, the Polish
government has used the fog of war to advance its authoritarian agenda
even since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24.
Among other anti-democratic moves just since then, it has continued
appointing justices loyal to the party, refused to implement key
international court rulings, and filed a draft law in the Polish
parliament to discourage foreign funding of Polish watchdogs and civil
society organizations.

And Hungary and Poland are not the only countries of concern in Central
Europe. If trends remain unchanged, illiberal leftist leaders Peter
Pellegrini and Robert Fico have a high probability of returning to power
in Slovakia's 2024 parliamentary elections, even though Fico is under
investigation on allegations of organized crime. Such a change in power
could once again derail Slovakia's struggling democracy and put the
country on an illiberal track again as well.

Clearly, democracy is not the only game in town anymore in Central
Europe. While many Western stakeholders might be tempted to make
concessions to the region's illiberal strongmen in order to preserve EU
and NATO unity, this approach was a key enabling factor and will only
continue to weaken European and transatlantic organizations further. In
the face of the clear authoritarian threat posed by Russia and China,
challenging these trends in Central Europe to strengthen the democratic
integrity of the Western alliance is more crucial than ever.

The US and EU Response

[[Western responses to autocratization in Hungary]{.mark} and Poland
[have]{.mark} long [been weak]{.mark}, with the EU and the United States
always **reluctant** to take action for various reasons at various
times]{.underline}. In times of crisis, such as in the 2015 refugee
crisis and now during Russia's war on Ukraine, the West seems reluctant
to challenge these demagogues on their anti-democratic actions, lest
they stop cooperating on the crisis issue of the moment. But when Europe
or the United States are not experiencing an acute crisis[,
[they]{.mark} seem to [lack the motivation to]{.mark} [challenge]{.mark}
these authoritarian regimes with firm action over i[ssues of
**democracy**]{.mark}, rule of law, [and
**corruption**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's as if there is never a right
moment to discipline illiberal strongmen in the Western alliance. As a
consequence, the authoritarian dynamics they have unleashed have
advanced largely unopposed.

Over the past year, for example, both the EU and the United States had
perfect opportunities to play hardball with Viktor Orbán --- the EU
through triggering its new rule of law conditionality mechanism that
allows it to officially suspend EU funds for Hungary based on violations
of EU standards for rule of law, while the United States could have done
so by imposing Magnitsky sanctions against key members of the regime.
But both the White House and the European Commission, the EU's executive
branch, backed down. If planned, timed, and publicly communicated
appropriately, such sanctions could have significantly improved the
opposition's odds in the elections.

Now, both the EU and [the United States will have to mount any challenge
to Orbán under more adverse conditions]{.underline}. In the EU, if the
political conflict with him escalates, he may be able to block EU
decision-making in the context of the war in Ukraine. Nevertheless, it
would be dangerous for democracy if the EU and the United States
continue to pull their punches. And the EU is showing signs of
understanding this: In order to preserve at least some of its democratic
credibility, the EU surprisingly announced the triggering of the rule of
law conditionality mechanism against Hungary in April, right after the
elections.

The United States now should follow suit, to raise the pressure on the
regime, especially considering Orbán's alignment with the Kremlin.
Washington should introduce the planned Magnitsky sanctions against key
figures of the Orbán regime. Only a coordinated transatlantic approach
and the deployment of targeted sanctions is likely to change Orbán's
cost-benefit calculation and deter him from further autocratization.
After 12 years of softball, its high time to play a different game.

What Comes Next?

Hungary's democratic backsliding is the product of many factors, few of
which are unique to Hungary. This is not a comforting thought: What
happened in Hungary could happen elsewhere too. Given a ruling \[End
Page 48\] party willing to bend the rules in its own favor and a weak,
fractured opposition, it is hard to see where political change can come
from. [There are [NGOs]{.mark} that [have been]{.mark} surprisingly
[efficient at organizing]{.mark} large [rallies]{.mark}, [but the
government's]{.mark} legal and [propaganda]{.mark} campaigns against
them [have rendered their position]{.mark} very
[fragile]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Can the opposition parties learn to pull together? They do seem to
realize more keenly than before that the "narcissism of small
differences" among them has been a pillar of the Fidesz supermajority.
In February 2018, all the opposition parties rallied behind a single
mayoral candidate in a southern town known to be a Fidesz stronghold.
The win scored by this candidate, an independent local entrepreneur with
strong conservative credentials, suggested a winning formula. In
general, however, the opposition remains too much a Budapest phenomenon,
without the local structures outside the capital that it will take to
challenge the ruling party. That party, meanwhile, is becoming
increasingly successful at controlling the parliamentary opposition,
which is coming to resemble the sham "opposition" to
**[Putin]{.underline}**'s United Russia party in the Russian State Duma.

[In foreign affairs, [Orbán will most likely keep up his East-West
balancing act]{.mark}, trying to make the most of EU and NATO membership
[while cementing his hybrid regime]{.mark} ever [**more firmly** into
place]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russian, Chinese, Turkish, and Azerbaijani
leaders will continue to find receptive partners in Hungary. In January
2018, Orbán said that an EU funding cutoff would turn him toward
China.23 Three months later, Hungary became the only EU country that
refused to sign a statement criticizing China's Belt and Road
Initiative.24

Orbán's illiberal model has been having a major impact not only in
Central and Eastern Europe, but in the Western Balkans as well. [In an
increasing "soft power" attempt, [Orbán is reaching out to countries in
the **Western Balkans**]{.mark}, and, mostly successfully,
[supporting]{.mark} local (mainly [right-wing]{.mark}) [strongmen in
Croatia]{.mark}, [Macedonia]{.mark}, [Montenegro]{.mark},
S[erbia]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} (as we have seen)
[Slovenia]{.mark}.]{.underline} Along with Hungary's
government-organized media, Hungarian energy companies have been
expanding their Western Balkan presence. [[Orbán]{.mark}, as a model
politician of the broader region, [has been spreading his ideology and
working on creating a]{.mark} "**[s]{.mark}phere [o]{.mark}f
[i]{.mark}nfluence**" [among]{.mark} nearby countries, both those that
already belong to **[the EU]{.mark}** and some that aspire to
join.]{.underline}

[[Hungary has become a successful]{.mark} laboratory of **[illiberal
governance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Fidesz has remodeled the country's
institutions to suit ruling-party purposes. Identity politics and
conspiracy theories abound, as state-funded media churn out fake news.
Given the positive voter feedback regarding all this, we should expect
it to continue.25

Can pressures from outside change that? Budapest's relations with both
Brussels and Washington are at a low point. In early 2017, the European
Parliament began proceedings that could take away Hungary's voting
rights, though this is not a likely outcome. A more realistic scenario
\[End Page 49\] envisions the European People's Party moving to strip
Fidesz of its membership, which would weaken it domestically. [[Orbán
has]{.mark} had to work constantly [to strike the right balance]{.mark}
between advantageous provocations and necessary concessions. [Until
now]{.mark}, when forced to choose between the East and **the West**,
[he has always chosen]{.mark} the latter]{.underline}. Yet [the
West]{.mark} has never succeeded in forcing him to compromise on his
drive to centralize power.

[While the Biden administration has elevated the fight against

among]{.mark} its European NATO allies, particularly [Hungary]{.mark}**
**[and Poland.]{.mark} Both [countries experienced the sharpest decline

incumbents, Viktor Orbán's Fidesz party in Hungary and Poland's Law and
Justice (PiS) led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, came to power in 2010 and 2015,
respectively.]{.underline} The fact that neither of the world's two
leading democracy-measuring institutions --- [Freedom
House](https://freedomhouse.org/report/nations-transit) and
[V-Dem](https://www.v-dem.net/files/25/DR%202021.pdf) --- considers
Hungary to be any sort of democracy anymore should raise alarm about the
true authoritarian nature of illiberal projects among U.S. allies in
Central and Eastern Europe. [**[If Washington turns a blind eye to the
authoritarian developments in its]{.mark} own self-described,
value-based [alliance system, the U.S. risks]{.mark} running into the
accusation of double standards, which may [significantly weaken its
democracy agenda. ]{.mark}**However,]{.underline} **[[the
autocratization of Hungary and Poland]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[poses]{.underline}]{.mark} [more [challenges for the
U.S]{.mark}]{.underline}.** [than just its credibility when it comes to
democracy and rule of law. Besides Turkey]{.underline},
**[[Hungary]{.mark} is the only NATO member state that [fails to
comply,]{.mark} not only [with democratic values]{.mark} that the
current administration promotes, but also with the foreign policy
priorities and interests of the U.S.]{.underline}** regarding China and
Russia. In stark contrast to Budapest, Poland's commitment to NATO has
been unshakeable because of the existential [security
threat](https://www.dw.com/en/russia-is-the-only-conceivable-threat-to-poland/a-45826423)
stemming from Russia. Warsaw also has been ready in the past to comply
with Washington's main expectations regarding China, in order to keep
the U.S. engaged as a security provider on [NATO's Eastern
Flank](https://warontherocks.com/2020/06/nato-needs-a-coherent-approach-to-defending-its-eastern-flank/).
However, since the Biden administration took office, Poland appears to
be distancing itself from Washington's China policy by seeking a more
intense and balanced relationship with Beijing and labeling U.S.-China
strategic competition as a "bilateral issue." Warsaw may believe it has
the upper hand in U.S.-Poland bilateral relations if it rests on the
assumption that the U.S. won't reduce its security engagement on the
Eastern Flank without undermining its own strategic approach to NATO.
According to the Polish perception, the Biden administration cannot
credibly threaten Poland with weakening security cooperation if the PiS
government further proceeds with its authoritarian agenda. How can
Washington then address the autocratization of its Central European NATO
allies, Hungary and Poland, and their rapprochement with Beijing? [While
U.S. influence over Hungary might be limited, Washington still does have
significant leverage over Poland because of Warsaw's substantial
interest in security cooperation. **[Washington should be ready to play
out the security card to put pressure on Warsaw.]{.mark}** First, it
should calibrate its diplomatic and policy moves in a way that drives a
wedge between Poland and Hungary.]{.underline} This could allow European
Union institutions to address authoritarian developments in both
countries, but primarily in Hungary, more effectively. How can such a
strategy be realized? U.S. diplomacy should clearly communicate with
Poland that Warsaw's strategic alliance with Budapest poses a heavy
burden on any further deepening of the security cooperation.Washington
also should use the security cooperation card on the Polish domestic
stage to weaken the vanguards of authoritarian politics in the Polish
government coalition and strengthen moderate forces. It should
communicate the message on all available channels that the policies of
Justice Minister [Zbigniew
Ziobro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Ziobro) pose severe
obstacles to deeper transatlantic relations, while Deputy Prime Minister
[Jarosław Gowin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaros%C5%82aw_Gowin)
should be backed in parallel. Furthermore, as a strong contrast to
former [President Trump's](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump/)
approach to the European Union, [President
Biden](https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden/) should recognize --- and
use --- EU institutions as potential vehicles for amplifying U.S.
interests. In this spirit, the U.S. should elevate the question of
autocratizing EU member states to the highest levels of the
transatlantic dialogue and create a discourse of reciprocity with regard
to the democracy homework that both the U.S. and the EU have to do on
the home front. The U.S. recently started working on strengthening
democracy at home after Trump's four-year onslaught on democratic
institutions, but the EU largely has failed to do so for a decade. Since
the European Union expressed its high expectations for a renewal and
reinforcement of U.S. democracy, Washington should not shy away from
communicating the same message to EU institutions and key European
governments, including Germany. Germany lately has evolved into a key
autocracy-enabler within the EU, so Berlin's policy toward Budapest and
Warsaw also should be put on the U.S.-German bilateral relations
agenda.To provide the appropriate impetus for U.S.-EU dialogue on
authoritarian developments in Europe, and to push EU institutions toward
a more activist approach, Washington could consider moves that may
ridicule EU passivity, especially towards Hungary. In similar fashion,
as it happened recently with former Slovak general prosecutor [Dobroslav
Trnka](https://www.state.gov/designation-of-former-prosecutor-general-dobroslav-trnka-of-the-slovak-republic-for-involvement-in-significant-corruption/),

That would put pressure on the EU to act and could help to push forward
the application of the EU's rule of law conditionality regulation, which
is actually suspended. With an eye on the upcoming 2022 elections in
Hungary, the U.S. should emphasize the question of electoral integrity
both in its dialogue with the EU and within the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe ([OSCE](https://www.osce.org/)) and
should act proactively to put in place a robust international electoral
monitoring mission under an OSCE flag. [On a bilateral level, the U.S.
should renew its commitment to supporting democracy in central and
eastern Europe,]{.underline} making financial resources available for
the support of critical civil society and free media, and [calibrating
priorities in a way that will allow for grants to have real impact on
the ground. **[If Washington would like to preserve the credibility of
its democracy agenda, it must address the autocratization of its Central
European allies in a convincing way. ]{.mark}**]{.underline}However, [it
can only succeed if the Biden administration is ready to meddle in
European politics in unprecedented ways.]{.underline}

#### Hungary is the main conduit to Russian influence, only the counterplan can solve.

James **Kirchick**, 1-7-20**19**, \"Is Hungary becoming a rogue state in
the center of Europe?,\" Brookings,
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/01/07/is-hungary-becoming-a-rogue-state-in-the-center-of-europe/,

Most of the international criticism directed at Hungary over the past
nine years has focused on domestic indicators such as the rule of law,
separation of powers and press freedom. [[Prime Minister Viktor
Orban]{.mark} [has been]{.mark} remarkably blunt about his designs for
Hungary, citing China, Russia and Turkey as models]{.underline}. After
an election in April widely deemed free but not fair, he sounded a
triumphal note, [[declaring that]{.mark} "the era of [**liberal
democracy** is **over**."]{.mark}]{.underline} Since Orban won
reelection, however, his behavior has called into question not only his
democratic bona fides, but also his basic trustworthiness as an ally of
the United States and member of the democratic Western world.
Increasingly, [[Hungary is]{.mark} behaving like [a **rogue
state.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Consider the actions that Orban and his
Fidesz Party government have taken in the past few weeks. Last month, at
a meeting of NATO foreign ministers, [the Hungarian envoy did his best
to sabotage any improvement in relations between the Western alliance
and Ukraine.]{.underline} As its excuse the Budapest government is using
a recent language-law reform in Ukraine that allegedly threatens the
Hungarian-speaking minority. By exploiting such a frivolous issue to
obstruct NATO support for Ukraine---whose land Russia seized in the
first armed territorial annexation on the European continent since World
War II---[[Hungary is doing **Moscow's bidding**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Nor is this the first time that the Hungarians have done so. In late
November, Hungary denied a U.S. request to extradite a pair of Russian
arms dealers who had attempted to sell antiaircraft missiles to Mexican
drug cartels. Instead of handing over the father-and-son weapons
traffickers to a fellow NATO ally, Orban's government allowed the men
safe passage back to Russia. Though Hungary formally supports European
Union sanctions on Russia, Orban has been the most vociferous internal
critic of the measures, frequently calling for them to be dropped. At a
time when Europe has shunned Russian President Vladimir Putin for his
aggression against Ukraine and manifold other abuses, [the Russian
leader has made multiple, friendly visits to the Hungarian
capital,]{.underline} where Orbán has embraced him. Today [[Hungary
is]{.underline}]{.mark} considered by some in the intelligence world to
be [[the main conduit for **Russian influence**]{.mark}**-**peddling
within the Western alliance]{.underline}. "There is tremendous concern
that [Russia is basically using Hungary as an intel forward operating
base in NATO and the EU]{.underline}," a former official at the U.S.
Embassy in Budapest told Politico in 2017. Orban shares with Putin a
dark predilection ostensibly proscribed by membership in Western
institutions such as the E.U. and NATO: revanchism. A century after
Hungary lost two-thirds of its territory as a result of World War I,
inflaming nationalist sentiment among the Hungarian diaspora living in
the region remains a priority for the Hungarian right. Last summer, at
the same political festival in Romania where, four years earlier, he had
hailed the onset of the "illiberal state," Orban delivered a
disturbingly irredentist speech to the local Hungarian community.
Repeatedly referring to the Romanian territory on which he stood by its
Hungarian name, "Székely Land," he attacked the Romanian government for
allegedly saying that "Székely Land doesn't exist" and insisted that
"Székely Land will still exist when the whole of Europe has already
submitted to Islam."

Long discounted as a marginal figure on the periphery of Europe and the
leader of a small country with an obscure language, Orban has emerged as
one of the most consequential political figures of the 21st century.
Years before Brexit, President Trump and other manifestations of
national populism rose across the West, Orban was already in power,
busily transforming Hungary into a one-party state and distancing it
from traditional democratic allies. Stephen K. Bannon, Trump's former
top strategist, lauds Orban as "Trump before Trump." Only 55[, [Orban
is]{.mark} a political visionary, [plotting a]{.mark} potential
post-Atlantic, [post-NATO,]{.mark} post-E.U. [future]{.mark} for his
country]{.underline}. Anticipating a time when the West will be
disintegrated [[and]{.mark}]{.underline} overrun by Muslims, [he [is
**reorienting Hungary** toward the **authoritarian**
East]{.mark}]{.underline}. "We all sense---it's in the air---that the
world is in the process of a substantial realignment," he giddily
declared during a 2017 visit that Putin made to Budapest. Speaking in
Brussels last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized "powerful
countries and actors whose ambition is to reshape the international
order in \[their\] own illiberal image." Pompeo was targeting American
adversaries such as Russia and China, revisionist powers trying to
overturn the international liberal order constructed and sustained by
the United States. But his words also describe what Orban is doing
within the Western alliance itself.

If Orban were a reliable ally of the United States, then perhaps his
democratic backsliding could be excused. During the Cold War, the United
States was willing to overlook authoritarian tendencies---even outright
military dictatorships---among its NATO allies, provided they were
anti-communist. [Today,]{.underline} however[, the central geopolitical
struggle in Europe is no longer between capitalism and communism, but
democracy and authoritarianism. And it is increasingly difficult to tell
which side Viktor Orban is on.]{.underline}

### Impact -- Cohesion/Russia

#### Poor relations with Hungary and Poland undermine unity in the alliance and pose a threat to NATO's response to Russia

[The overriding concern of this week's NATO Summit will be cohesion,
with]{.underline} **[[the security alliance facing crises of disunity on
multiple fronts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [In the West, President Donald
Trump repeatedly calls into question NATO's strategic value and berates
America's closest allies.]{.underline} Already, he has sent [hostile
letters](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/world/europe/trump-nato.html?contentCollection=BreakingNews&contentID=67242317)
to the leaders of several NATO member-states demanding they do more to
pay their own way. In the East, an aggressive Russia has used
conventional and nonconventional weapons to invade sovereign states and
undermine European and American security. In continental Europe, migrant
and refugee flows not seen since World War II are roiling internal
politics within frontline and destination states. There is also
significant democratic backsliding among NATO member states. The cast of
illiberal characters---who are leading the charge in the wrong
direction---includes the recently reelected and empowered Turkish
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party
(AKP), Jaroslaw Kaczynski's Law and Justice (PiS) Party in Poland, and
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and the ruling Fidesz Party. Each
has proven more than willing to repress free media, dismantle checks and
balances, demonize political opposition, clamp down on civil society,
and diminish the rule of law. America's democratic system and norms
under President Trump are also under duress; as a result, Freedom House
[downgraded the country's
score](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/united-states)
on the basis of weakening political rights and civil liberties. Despite
these alarming developments, NATO leaders have relegated democratic
backsliding to the backburner. Opponents of making the case for
democracy within NATO might argue that pushing Ankara, Warsaw, and
Budapest too hard on their commitments to good governance will
exacerbate already tense divisions in the alliance. Others might say
that Russia would be the prime beneficiary of a contentious democracy
discussion at NATO. Yet this is a counterproductive approach with
current and potential costs to NATO's future. [Here are three
security-based reasons why the United States and NATO should care about
democratic backsliding, and actions the alliance can take to address
them]{.underline}.**[[Russia is]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[already]{.underline} **[[benefiting from and effectively leveraging its
relationships with Hungary and]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Turkey **[to
exacerbate discord within]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Europe

and Orbán has courted Russian

and political support as he builds an illiberal democracy in
Hungary.]{.underline} **[[Russian propaganda also finds fertile ground
in Hungarian media.]{.underline}]{.mark}** A 2018 Senate Foreign
Relations Committee
[report](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FinalRR.pdf) noted
that Russian state-owned media content "by Sputnik and RT is widely
referenced by pro-government news sources in Hungary." The report cited
Orbán as the EU and NATO's most supportive leader of Putin's worldview
and leadership. Acting as the Russian "camel's nose under the tent,"
Orbán is thwarting Ukraine and NATO's partnership efforts by blocking
the Ukraine-NATO Commission from meeting at the upcoming summit. In
Turkey, Erdoğan has rattled the NATO alliance by pursuing a deal to
purchase the S-400 missile system from Russia. In addition to hurting
NATO's ability to cooperate on security, the system is also [not
compatible](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-foreign-usa-turkey/pompeo-presses-turkey-on-s-400-missiles-purchase-from-russia-idUSKBN1HY2A6)
with NATO's defenses. Through arms and energy deals, Putin uses Turkey
as a wedge to divide NATO. Similarly, Erdoğan might see his deals with
Putin as a way to free Turkey from Western leverage, particularly as
[European states push
back](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-turkey/in-warning-to-ankara-eu-cuts-funds-for-turkeys-membership-bid-idUSKBN1DU2D4)
on his brand of authoritarian politics by cutting EU pre-accession
funds. After winning the recent twin parliamentary and presidential
elections, an emboldened Erdoğan will likely become an even more
problematic partner for NATO. President Putin is building ties with
illiberal leaders across Europe while attacking fundamental elements of
Western democracies. Other illiberal and populist governments, including
Italy's new anti-establishment government, could follow suit in
enhancing their partnerships with Russia, creating future
intelligence-sharing and cohesion problems for the alliance. President
Putin is building ties with illiberal leaders across Europe while
attacking fundamental elements of Western democracies, including
electoral process and open information spaces. There is a [strong
link](https://www.brookings.edu/research/liberal-democracy-and-the-path-to-peace-and-security/)
between democratic governance and security gains. Liberal democracies
have historically been less likely to experience intra- and interstate
conflict, generate refugees, and harbor violent extremists. They are
also better at maintaining transparent institutions, civilian control of
the military and intelligence services, and working together on
confidence-building measures, all of which are core features of NATO's
ability to collectively defend its members. On the other hand,
[**[corruption and insecurity grow under politicized institutions and
poor rule of law. This hurts NATO's renewed efforts to combat
terrorism,]{.mark}** as military and security communities have long
acknowledged the connection between corruption and the existence of
criminal networks, traffickers, and terrorists within state
borders.]{.underline} **[[Corruption also opens space for Russian
kleptocratic networks close to Putin to operate and gain
influence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, in 2014 Orbán awarded
Rosatom, a Russian state-owned nuclear company, the sole contract to
build two nuclear plants in Hungary [in exchange for a 10 billion euro
loan](https://www.rferl.org/a/putin-hungary-orban-judo/28700669.html)
from Moscow. The Hungarian parliament, dominated by Orbán's Fidesz
Party, then passed a rushed vote to keep data from the nuclear deal
confidential for 30 years in the name of "national security." [The deal
diminished transparent economic competition within the European Union
and solidified Hungary and Russia's energy ties.]{.underline}
**[[Distrust among allies hurts alliance
interoperability.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The PiS Party's assault on
independent media and the Constitutional Court, including efforts last
week to summarily force out [27 Polish Supreme Court
justices](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/07/03/how-the-eu-is-fighting-to-protect-the-rule-of-law-in-poland),
have isolated Poland from France and Germany, diminishing trust among
the European nations. This could make it increasingly difficult for
Washington to gain consensus on joint decisions, communications, and
operations. [**[If NATO is dedicated to building resiliency along

[In April 2021, [Hungary blocked an EU]{.mark} (European Union)
[statement condemning China for its]{.mark} [authoritarian]{.mark} Hong
[Kong security law]{.mark}]{.underline}, [it[s latest in a series of
efforts shielding the Chinese regime from criticism]{.mark}.1 The
backlash from the EU and its largest member, Germany, was fierce. German
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas called Hungary's move an "absolutely
incomprehensible" action that prevented the EU from speaking with "one
voice" over China.2]{.underline} "This is not the first time that
Hungary has broken away from \[the EU's\] unity when it comes to the
issue of China," Maas said.2 Nor will it likely be the last. Since Prime
Minister Viktor Orbán came to power in 2010 and Hungary joined the 16+1
Initiative in 2012 and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013[,
China has become an important factor in Hungary-EU relations. [Western
claims that Hungary]{.mark} was or [is]{.mark} becoming [a Chinese
"puppet"3 or "Trojan horse"4 that could damage]{.mark} the EU's [unity
from within]{.mark} have become commonplace; they [are]{.mark} often
[fueled by incidents such as the blocked EU statement and Orbán's
insistence on treating China as a partner and ally rather than as a
competitor and rival.]{.mark}]{.underline} Hungary's technological
dealings with China also actively concern the US; Hungary's use of
China's Huawei tech despite US pressure has especially been a source of
tension between the two governments. [In short, Budapest's relations
with Beijing, especially with regard to the BRI, have heightened
tensions with the US, the EU, and within Hungary itself. Ultimately, how
the transatlantic alliance finds itself challenged by the Sino-Hungarian
relationship informs how the US and EU choose to respond.]{.underline}
This report therefore seeks to answer the following questions: In what
ways does Hungary's political-economic relationship with China impact
the transatlantic alliance as it seeks to counter China? How can and
should the US respond to these concerns, if at all? To address these
questions, the remainder of this report proceeds as follows. Section 2
describes Hungary's relationship with the EU and the US. Section 3
explains how the Hungary-China relationship concerns the transatlantic
alliance. Section 4 explains the nature of and dispels myths about
Hungary's relationship with China and describes the driving force behind
the relationship. Section 5 discusses policy options and proposes a set
of policy solutions. Section 5 concludes. With the end of the Cold War
and Hungary's acceptance into NATO and the EU in 1999 and 2004
respectively, Hungary became a welcomed and involved member of the
transatlantic community. [Since Orbán came to power in 2010, however,
Hungary's relationships with the EU and the US have been tense, with
China becoming a particular irritant in recent years.]{.underline} The
Hungary-EU relationship has proved politically tense but economically
strong over the past decade, with both Hungarian domestic politics and
foreign policy toward undemocratic states such as China playing an
important role. Since 2010, [EU member Hungary has touted itself
domestically as an "illiberal democracy"6 and a one-party state at the
heart of Europe, distancing itself from its "traditional \[European\]
democratic allies,"7 and drawing closer to other, non-European regimes
such as China, Russia, and Turkey]{.underline}.8 Claiming it has
systematically failed to comply with EU norms, policies, and
expectations such as protecting the rule of law and standing for
democracy,9 the EU has criticized Hungary for behaving like a "rogue
state"7 within Europe. Hungary has flatly denied all accusations of
wrongdoing, calling the EU a "liberal empire"7 and claiming it abuses
its power, targets the state, and unjustly meddles in its domestic
affairs. Driven by Orbán, Hungary's conflict with the EU has become
especially acute. Elected in 2010, Orbán has gradually "align\[ed\] the
judicial, executive and legislative branches"11 in favor of his
national-conservative, right-wing Fidesz party, effectively turning
Hungary into a one-party state.In September 2018, the tension between
Hungary and the EU worsened when the European Parliament voted to
trigger Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union, an action that
could ultimately threaten Hungary's EU funding and voting rights.6 [This
past year, they have further clashed or diverged on several foreign
policy issues, with China most recently taking center stage. For
instance, as internal strife began in Belarus following the (still)
disputed results of the August 2021 presidential election,]{.underline}
Orbán's Hungary, which shares Aliaksandr Lukashenka's authoritarian
tendencies,12 called simply for dialogue with Belarus as the rest of the
EU called for diplomatic or economic coercion.13 Later, in November
2020, Hungary blocked the EU budget including a COVID-19 relief package,
objecting to a provision that would make funds contingent upon a
country's respect for democratic norms.14 [Most recently, Hungary
blocked or refused to sign several EU statements criticizing China for
its actions related to Hong Kong and the South China Sea, and atrocities
against the Uyghurs.]{.underline} This political tension has not led to
economic friction, let alone a decoupling of their economies. Indeed,
despite Hungary's Opening to the East Strategy of cultivating economic
links with China through 16+1 and BRI, Hungary-EU economic ties remain
significant. For instance, Hungary continues to receive over €4bn
(\$4.6bn) from the EU per year, while contributing less than €1bn
(\$1.16bn) to the EU budget,16 making it the fourth-largest net
recipient of EU funding.17 The EU also is Hungary's largest economic
partner, with 82% of its exports going to EU member states and 75% of
its imports coming from within the EU.16 Eight of its 10 top importers
and nine of its 10 top exporters are EU members (the UK is its tenth
importer, Russia is its ninth exporter, and China is its third
exporter).18 Germany, its top trading partner both for imports (25.3%)
and exports (27.7%),18 is particularly important to Hungary, leading to
a largely positive relationship that Hungary has come to depend on.19
Berlin therefore holds a level of economic and political leverage over
Budapest that few, if any, other countries share.20 [The US-Hungary
[relationship has also weathered some tension over the past
decade]{.mark}, some [related to]{.mark} domestic [Hungarian affairs and
others to China]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Figure 2). As [Hungary trended
toward authoritarianism, the US, led by President Barack Obama --- [a
self-described champion of democracy, liberalism, and the rule of
law]{.mark}]{.underline} --- gave Orbán the cold shoulder, effectively
cutting off high-level contacts.21 With Hungary's interest in political
recognition secondary to its desire for national security that the US
--- and not the EU --- could offer through NATO, such lack of American
appreciation, though problematic, would not generate outright
anti-Americanism. Additionally, Orbán said in 2016 that "economic
relations... \[remained\] good" during this period.22 This tame response
reflects Hungary's inherent dependence on the US and a respect for its
power. Under President Donald Trump, relations saw an immediate reset.
Orbán "welcomed" Trump's 2016 presidential victory8 and Trump equally
welcomed Orbán, inviting him to the White House in May 2019 to "lavish
praise" on the prime minister.23 Orbán's Hungary and Trump's America
shared an embrace of nationalism, "authoritarian populist\"24
governance, and skepticism of Western alliances, but they did have tense
moments. For instance, the US considered Hungary a "growing liability"
for the transatlantic alliance and reportedly considered sanctioning
Orbán's close associates in 2019.25 [One [significant "liability" is
Hungary's continued use of China's Huawei 5G tech]{.mark}nology,26
[despite US warnings]{.mark} that Huawei is a national security risk and
should be shunned.5 [Orbán's government even allowed Huawei to establish
an R&D center in Budapest in 2020]{.mark}]{.underline} This tech-driven
tension that originated during the Trump era remains a growing issue and
one of the Biden administration's primary challenges as it seeks to
strengthen its leadership and improve its competitiveness in the CEE
region. CHALLENGES POSED TO THE TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE BY HUNGARY-CHINA
RELATIONS. The [Sino-Hungarian relationship has raised the transatlantic
alarm]{.underline} and ultimately creates the following primary
challenges: First, [[it emboldens Orbán and exacerbates ideological and
policy divisions within the EU]{.mark}, making a united EU and joint
US-EU response to China more difficult.]{.underline} Second, BRI and the
relationship lays bare the US's inability to establish a strong economic
presence in the CEE region to compete with China. Additionally, the
relationship, especially Hungary's use of Huawei, puts into relief the
US's lack of technology leadership on infrastructure and
telecommunications networks development in Europe. Responding to these
challenges requires strategies at the US and transatlantic levels. The
West must be careful not to misjudge the nature and degree of the threat
the Sino-Hungarian relationship poses or misunderstand what drives the
relationship, lest it overreact politically and worsen the situation.
UNDERSTANDING HUNGARY-CHINA RELATIONS To properly address the challenges
posed by Hungary-China relations, the transatlantic alliance must
understand several points. First, contrary to the perception created by
the Hungarian and Chinese governments, the relationship offers limited
economic benefits for Hungary, which therefore remains largely dependent
upon the EU and the US. Second, Orbán himself is the main driving force
behind Hungary's pro-China policy; his personal cost-benefit analysis of
working with China comes before Hungary's more generally. Third and
last, there is a minimal threat to the transatlantic alliance of a
Chinese "Trojan horse" in Hungary controlling foreign policy. THE
PERCEPTION VERSUS REALITY OF HUNGARY\'S GAINS Seeking to ease its
economic dependence on the West following the 2008 financial crisis,
Hungary adopted an "Opening to the East Strategy" to cultivate ties with
China; the 16+1 initiative and BRI were therefore welcome opportunities.
From the start of 16+1 and BRI, the Hungarian and Chinese governments
have pointed to developments that suggest Hungary gains substantially
from the relationship and that their ties are "prosperous," in the words
of Xinhua, a Chinese state-run news agency.28 For instance, the
governments note that China is now Hungary's greatest trade partner
outside of the EU, with annual trade worth approximately \$9 bn.29 Since
2013, Hungary has been one the largest recipients of the billions of
dollars China has poured into infrastructure projects in CEE.30 It
boasts the highest level of cumulative Chinese FDI from 2000 to 2020 of
all the EU's CEE countries, (\$3.1 bn), 23% more than second-place
Poland (see Figure 3).31 Hungary also reports that last year China
invested almost \$6 bn in the country (see Figure 4), more than most
other CEE members.32 Hungary and China have also signed a deal to build
the Belgrade-to-Budapest railway.33 Furthermore, the [[Chinese and
Hungarian governments have frequently held talks]{.mark} at 16+1 summits
and BRI forums, and established a "comprehensive strategic
partnership,"34 setting the stage for further cooperation.]{.underline}
At first glance, these developments give the impression that Hungary has
seen large gains and has strengthened its ties with China --- and
thereby has also decreased its dependence on the EU. The reality,
however, is a different story. Few, if any, experts find that Hungary
has gained economically from its relations with China in a way that
substantially threatens the EU. Most, in fact, find the opposite.35
Hungary's post-2010 gains have been modest, exaggerated, or
underwhelming at best, and completely lacking at worst. First, the
Opening to the East policy has failed to deliver, with Hungary
increasing its trade dependence on China from 2009 to 2014 by less than
0.5%36 and keeping its trade dependence on the EU at over 75%. Second,
Hungary's \$3.2 bn cumulative completed Chinese FDI is minimal compared
with the rest of Europe; Germany and the UK have received more than 9
times that amount (see Figure 3), reflecting China's priorities and
preference for ties with Western Europe over Hungary. Third, Hungary
received only \$4.07 bn in Chinese investment last year --- not \$5.95
bn or \$5.36 bn, as the Hungarian and Chinese governments respectively
claimed. Indeed, both governments inflated their figures to create the
illusion that China was more invested and involved in Hungary than it
actually was (see Figure 4).36 Fourth, the Belgrade-to-Budapest railway
offers little, if any, economic benefit to Hungary; some estimates
suggest it could take between 130 and 2,400 years (!) before Hungary
makes a profit from it.37 Fifth, from 2010 to 2019, Hungary-China export
and import levels decreased --- not increased --- by 16% and 14%
respectively.38 The reality is clear: The cost-benefit analysis shows
that Hungary, as opposed to Orbán himself, gains little from its
relationship with China. Rationally speaking, abandoning the EU and the
US in favor of China is not in Hungary's economic or political
interests.

ORBAN\'s \'ONE MAN SHOW\' If Hungary does not economically profit from
its relationship with China, what drives the relationship and why does
Hungary push to work with China? The answer: Orbán. As an authoritarian
leader, one of Orbán's main goals, especially approaching this year's
elections, is to maintain his support and legitimize his illiberal
regime, sometimes even at a cost to his country. Following this logic,
the prime minister cultivates a relationship with China for several key
reasons: [[Orbán seeks to maintain a set of strong illiberal
"friends,"]{.mark} [such as Russia]{.mark}, Turkey, Brazil, [and
China]{.mark}, [that legitimize his regime]{.mark}. In other words, in
[cultivating economic partnerships with countries like China]{.mark},
[Orbán]{.mark} [seeks to ensure that he has economic and political
alternatives if he should sever Hungary's relationship with the EU and
the US]{.mark}.]{.underline} Once Orbán realized the Chinese government
would ultimately not be Hungary's economic savior, he began to leverage
Beijing for political gain in his battles with Brussels. By threatening
to turn toward China, Orbán seeks to create the impression that he has a
strong hand. In politics, perception often trumps reality. [[Orbán's
inner circle directly gains from his relationship with China]{.mark}.
For example, Opus Global, a company controlled by Orbán's oligarch
friend Lőrinc Mészáros, "won" the contract to build Hungary's section of
the Budapest-to-Belgrade railway. The \$2.1 bn deal could earn Mészáros
a princely sum.]{.underline}39 Ultimately, Hungary's China policy is
"not a national strategy, but a one-man show," says Tamás Matura, an
expert on central and eastern Europe's relations with China.40 The
relationship is a function of Orbán himself. The opposition parties and
candidates do not share the prime minister's regard for China,
especially since the controversy around the creation of China's Fudan
University campus in Budapest showed that being anti-China can poll
well. If Orbán were to lose to the United Opposition in Hungary's 2022
parliamentary elections, the country would likely do an about-face on
its China policy.40 THE TROJAN HORSE FALSE ALARM Ever since
Hungary-China relations intensified in the early 2010s, journalists and
news organizations have peddled the idea that Hungary is China's "Trojan
horse" in Europe,41 implying that China has influence in and control
over Hungary and thereby poses a threat to the EU. Some scholars argue
that China invests in CEE countries such as Hungary to achieve political
objectives such as a pro-China EU policy42 and that China strategically
invests in countries that offer a potentially high political reward.43
If indeed true, Hungary would therefore become a threat to be addressed
aggressively and rapidly by the West. [Admittedly[, China
possesses]{.mark} indirect [influence over Hungarian foreign policy
through the prime minister:]{.mark} The [more Chinese investment
benefits Orbán]{.mark} personally, more [he will encourage the
government to adopt pro-China stances and partnerships such as the
Belgrade-to-Budapest railway.]{.mark} Indeed, even without Chinese
pressure to engage, [Orbán seeks to cultivate ties and reap his own
benefits from Chinese investments in Hungary,
]{.mark}]{.underline}whether or not his country does.

Freedom House's latest [Nations in Transit
report](https://freedomhouse.org/report/nations-transit/2020/dropping-democratic-facade),
out Wednesday. In the study, which covers 29 countries from Central
Europe to Central Asia, the authors describe "[a stunning democratic
breakdown," saying that [there are "fewer democracies in the region
today than at any point]{.mark} [since]{.mark} the annual report was
launched in [1995]{.mark}."]{.underline} According to the report's
methodology, [[Hungary is now]{.mark} a "hybrid regime," having [lost
its status as a]{.mark} "semi-consolidated [democracy]{.mark}" [due
to]{.mark} Prime Minister **Viktor [Orbán's continued assaults on the
country's democratic institutions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The adoption
of an [emergency

that allows the government to rule by decree indefinitely, brought in
after the coronavirus pandemic struck, "[has further exposed [\[and\]
the **undemocratic character of Orbán's regime**]{.mark}]{.underline},"
the authors wrote, adding that "[**[Hungary's decline has been the most
precipitous \[they have\] ever tracked.]{.mark}**"]{.underline} Poland
isn't far behind, according to the report, which says there have been
spectacular attacks on the judiciary by the ruling Law and Justice
party. And Brussels gets much of the blame. "[Neither Poland nor Hungary
has faced repercussions for damaging the rule of law at
home]{.underline}, and Hungary's ruling Fidesz party has even remained a
member of the mainstream European People's Party, the largest grouping
in the European Parliament," according to the report, adding that U.S.
President Donald Trump has also "failed to stand up for democracy in the
region." In response, Zoltán Kovács, Hungary's secretary of state for
international communication and relations, said on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoltanspox/status/1257928073015709696?s=20)
that Freedom House "was once known as the bipartisan human rights
organization. With their \[George\] Soros funding they've declined,
becoming the fist of the party that is the Soros network. Anyone who
doesn't conform to their liberal view, gets downgraded." The report also
has serious concerns about the Balkans. "Years of ... strongman tactics
employed by Aleksandar Vučić in Serbia and Milo Đukanović in Montenegro
have tipped those countries over the edge," it says. "[For the first
time since 2003, [they are no longer **categorized as
democracies**]{.mark}]{.underline}." The assessment comes on the day of
an [EU-Balkans
summit](https://www.politico.eu/article/croatian-prime-miniter-andrej-plenovic-on-eu-western-balkans-summit-the-meeting-is-the-message-enlargement-coronavirus/),
which was supposed to be held in Croatia but will now take place over
videolink. The Freedom House report says foreign influence has been a
destabilizing factor. "In addition to Russia's continued malign
influence, China has been advancing an ambitious foreign policy in
practically all of the region's 29 countries," the authors say. "Xi
Jinping's regime is not so much spreading its own one-party model as it
is spreading its influence ... taking advantage of institutional
weaknesses, and wedging itself into corrupt political and economic
structures."

GBN/ RW

Early last month[, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán won a
[resounding
victory](https://www.newsweek.com/great-sovereignty-reclamation-movement-opinion-1696223)
and expanded his party\'s existing parliamentary
supermajority.]{.underline} That triumph represents a role reversal from
just a year and a half ago, when [Trump-ally Orbán had to confront the
fact that his country\'s transatlantic policies would be markedly
different]{.underline} after [Joe
Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)\'s presidential
victory. Now, [[it is time for the Biden administration to reach the
same inescapable conclusion and cultivate relations with a country it
has consistently shunned]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Orbán himself seemed to welcome such a reset when he addressed his
country\'s relationship with the United States in his victory
[speech](https://primeminister.hu/vikstories/speech-prime-minister-viktor-orban-following-election-victory-fidesz-kdnp)
on election night---something he had not done after any of his previous
victories. At least one side of the Atlantic is seeking dialogue.

Such dialogue is long overdue, as [[relations between the countries have
soured to one of its worst points since the fall of communism in Central
Europe]{.mark}.]{.underline} Until last week, [Hungary lacked an
American ambassador or nominee for a total of roughly four years since
2013, including the entire period of the Biden presidency to
date]{.underline}. (The recent
[nominee](https://telex.hu/belfold/2022/05/14/emberi-jogi-es-lmbtq-szoszolo-ugyvedet-kuld-budapesti-nagykovetnek-joe-biden)
boasts ties to the [Democratic
Party](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democratic-party), Hollywood and
the Trump impeachment process.) The country also was the only
[EU](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/eu) member not to be
[invited](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/time-for-the-state-department-to-stop-ignoring-hungary)
to Washington\'s highly publicized \"Summit for Democracy\" in December,
a fact that shouldn\'t be particularly surprising since Biden himself
grouped the country among the \"[thugs of the
world](https://www.newsweek.com/biden-big-tech-have-poland-hungary-their-crosshairs-opinion-1540063)\"
on the campaign trail.

[[Hungary, in turn, has reminded the United States that it no longer can
take its fealty for granted. The country has been careful not to
antagonize China or Russia, hedging its bets against long-term American
obstinance. Indeed, both Beijing and Moscow have dispatched high-level
diplomatic delegations to Budapest almost annually; Orbán has met
personally with both Xi and Putin since 2019. Both would be happy to
count Hungary among their allies.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Amidst that backdrop, [the Biden administration should swallow its pride
and avert the loss of an ally in the heart of Europe.]{.underline}

If Washington harbored doubts about the strategic importance of this
country of roughly 10 million, Russia\'s war in Ukraine should have put
an end to them. Hungary is one of four EU nations to border Ukraine. As
of this writing, Hungary has welcomed a
[half-million](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine) Ukrainian
refugees (a figure that represents 5% of the total Hungarian population)
since the start of the conflict. Both north-south and east-west energy
pipelines cross Hungary. American armored-vehicle
[companies](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2942958/biden-shifts-us-troops-in-europe-to-defend-frontline-nato-states/)
arrived in Hungary at the time of the Russian invasion---an arrangement
the U.S. government specifically
[requested](https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-hungary-military-idAFL8N2U853L).

For all the bluster about its supposedly warm relationship with Russia,
Hungary has been on the right side of the key issues in the Ukraine war.

with [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato) guidelines---Budapest
has carried its weight.

Given these realities, why can\'t the United States embrace its allies
on the Danube?

The diplomatic difficulties hinge, in large part, on two
political-rhetorical topics: democratic health and gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transgender issues. On both counts, the current American
government is letting naked politics cloud reasonable and prudent
judgment.

[Both countries have held national elections over the last two years.
During Hungary\'s election last month, the federal election bureau
tabulated results just hours after the polls closed. Hungarians went to
bed knowing the results. There were no meaningful uncertainties,
[allegations of wrongdoing](https://2000mules.com/) or protests.
Hungarian-American former New York Governor George Pataki recently
[opined](https://hungarytoday.hu/george-pataki-new-york-governor-viktor-orban-government-biden-hungarian-american-politics/)
that Hungary is a \"vibrant, healthy democracy,\" and that he has
\"never seen Hungary as alive, free and open as it is now.\" What Pataki
should have added is that objective legitimacy of process and subjective
desirability of result are distinct concepts. The Biden administration
would do well to acknowledge that distinction.]{.underline}

In the realm of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues, only
absolutists can take issue with the current landscape in Hungary.
Members of these communities live freely and openly in Hungary. An
[estimated](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2021/07/24/hungary-Pride-Budapest-protest-anti-LGBTQ-law/9831627153255/)
30,000 people participated in the 2021 rendition of the annual Budapest
\"pride\" event. In August 2021, one of the country\'s most prominent
advocates for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues participated
in a public debate at [MCC Feszt](https://mccfeszt.hu/en/), an event
covered in Western media solely because of [Tucker
Carlson](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/tucker-carlson)\'s presence.
While walking around Budapest, one is certain to encounter the
occasional rainbow flag hanging from a balcony. In this sense, the
Hungarian capital is far closer to London or Paris than it is to, say,
Moscow or Riyadh.

Most recently, this issue manifested itself through a law addressing the
sexual education of children, a subject that is [equally
topical](https://www.newsweek.com/against-dont-say-gay-propaganda-opinion-1686784)
in the United States. After a 2021 parliamentary law tackling the issue
received intense
[criticism](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-take-steps-against-hungary-over-anti-lgbt-bill-2021-06-23/)
from the EU and other supranational bodies, the Hungarian government
offered citizens the opportunity to vote on the matter in a direct
referendum. Voters considered informational events on sexual orientation
for minors without parental consent; promotion of gender-reassignment to
minors; unrestricted exposure of sexually explicit media content to
minors; and media depicting gender-changing procedures aimed at minors.
On all four questions, 92-96% of voters participating in the referendum
[voted](https://vtr.valasztas.hu/nepszavazas2022), \"No.\"

Once again, Washington has an opportunity to discern the differences
between legitimacy and desirability. The results of this referendum
represent direct democracy in its truest sense---a stark contrast, for
example, to a 5-4 [Supreme
Court](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/supreme-court) decision.

[Yet, what most certainly holds back a U.S.-Hungary rapprochement, more
than anything else, is the idea that right-leaning populists can both
win elections consistently and govern effectively in the heart of
Brussels-dominated Europe. At least three decades\' worth of U.S.
presidents have generally committed themselves to globalist policies
that are largely at odds with those currently promoted in Hungary. Joe
Biden himself has dedicated decades to those same principles. He and his
allies could decide to maintain a petty grudge, but this would be a
mistake---by the time they come around, Hungary might no longer be
waiting for them.]{.underline}

[[Hungarian]{.mark} [P]{.mark}rime [M]{.mark}inister Viktor

[[Hungary won't keep standing in the way of]{.mark} [E]{.mark}uropean
[U]{.mark}nion sanctions [except on]{.mark} vital matters of [energy
policy]{.mark},]{.underline} he told public radio in his weekly
interview on Friday. [[While Budapest will **still oppose**]{.mark} any
[sanctions on natural gas]{.mark} imports]{.underline}, it can't
constantly "go against the flow of traffic" in the bloc on non-energy
issues, as that would be inappropriate in a union built on "cooperation,
loyalty and mutual trust," he said.

[[Orban-led Hungary is Russia's closest ally in the EU and Orban has
had]{.mark} personal [disputes with]{.mark} Ukrainian President
Volodymyr [Zelenskiy]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The Hungarian premier
has]{.mark} also [managed to get EU sanctions]{.mark} packages
**[watered down]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the same time, [the
EU]{.underline} has retained clout by [threatening to withhold billions
of euros in aid from Hungary over his backsliding]{.underline} on the
rule of law.

[Underlining [Hungary]{.mark}'s ambivalent [stance toward
Russia]{.mark}, the government **[is sticking]{.mark}** to a nuclear
plant expansion project with Rosatom Corp.]{.underline}

Construction works on the extension of the country's Paks plant may
start as soon as September pending the obtaining of some remaining
paperwork, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said following a meeting
with Rosatom Chief Executive Alexey Likhachev.

'Open War'

Hungary must also boost its defense capabilities as the war is gradually
moving within Ukraine to territories that are closer to Hungary's own
borders, Orban said.

[[The premier]{.mark} struck a softer tone on Ukraine though, saying
that Hungary [and its allies were backing]{.mark} the government in
[Kyiv]{.mark}]{.underline} because Russia had been unjustified in
attacking.

"Everyone is on the side of the Ukrainians as one should be on the side
of the defender," he said. Russia had "no reason to attack another
country and start an open war, even if the Russians don't call it a
war."
