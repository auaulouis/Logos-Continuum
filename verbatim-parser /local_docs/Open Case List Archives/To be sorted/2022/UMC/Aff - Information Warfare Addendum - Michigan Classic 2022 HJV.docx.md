COVID-19 AND GREAT POWER COMPETITION COVID-19 (or coronavirus) has
ushered in a new era of heightened competition among major powers. The
pandemic's impact has far exceeded national security and public health[.
In addition to COVID-19 as a global health emergency, we see [increasing
weaponization]{.mark}1 [of the pandemic by both the Kremlin and the CCP
to achieve strategic goals]{.mark}. Unfortunately, [our own
resilience]{.mark} to oppose such aggressive acts remains
[under-matched]{.mark}. One of the key components of the CCP's strategy
concerns operations in the information sphere, per the so-called 'Three
Warfares'2 which is discussed later in the article. Below the threshold
of armed conflict and taking place in the 'grey zone', such information
operations manifest as either influence operations and/or 'strategic
preconditioning'3 for any later action, both with and without the use of
force.]{.underline}

INFORMATION WARFARE DURING COVID-19 Great Power competition of today is
evident in Western relations with both the Kremlin and the CCP. The
[[CCP]{.mark} appears [determined to shape the world to]{.mark} a
strategic vision where it will [safeguard its economic]{.mark},
strategic, [and security interests]{.mark} in Asia, the Pacific, Europe,
and the Arctic for generations to come.4 [Russia]{.mark}---its strategic
partner---[aims to rebuild]{.mark} Russia [as a 'Great Power']{.mark}
and player on the international scene with twin foci on Europe and on
where opportunities may arise for it to weaken Western influence and
interests]{.underline}. It should be noted that both the Kremlin and the
CCP are using concepts which we describe as either hybrid warfare and/or
grey-zone warfare, examples of which are best provided by contemporary
Russian warfare approaches.[5 Responding to the use of irregular
strategies employed by the CCP and the Kremlin, the U.S. has included
the concept of Great Power competition in its national security
strategy. Great Power competition entails the distribution of relative
gains with no finite terminal objectives. In this context, it is not
hard to see how [information warfare plays a critical role]{.mark} in
shaping how the great powers are competing in key issue areas where
[major powers use weaponized narratives to sow internal discord and
distrust]{.mark},6 rendering their adversaries unable to focus on
external threats. In other words, the information environment has thus
become one of the main battle spaces of Great Power competition. The
[need to approach]{.mark} [info]{.mark}rmation [warf]{.mark}are [from a
full-spectrum]{.mark} perspective is more acute than ever. While
disinformation mitigation is a critical component of information
statecraft, it is only a necessary component, not the sufficient whole.
[Both revisionist states use digital media]{.mark} [platforms]{.mark}
[and other information warfare capabilities]{.mark} not only [to]{.mark}
consolidate their authoritarian rule, but also to [undermine and disrupt
the l]{.mark}iberal [i]{.mark}nternational [o]{.mark}rder that the
United States and its allies have buttressed.7 Drawing on this
inspiration, [other autocrats]{.mark} are emulating the CCP and the
Kremlin to [exploit the information environment and undermine the
strategic interests of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.8
Authoritarian regimes further seem determined to weaponize digital media
and information technology from domestic population control mechanisms
to foreign policy tools.]{.underline}9 Emulating the Kremlin, the CCP
seems poised to weaponize the cyber domain, as well as publicly
available information (PAI) as tools of disruption and coercion.10 [For
example, the [CCP]{.mark} has [aggressively promoted patently false
narratives about the origin of the coronavirus]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In
addition, it has actively [promoted the Party's public health
'leadership']{.mark} using automated accounts, bots, and trolls, despite
numerous frauds and defects noticed in several countries.11 The [CCP's
COVID aid]{.mark} to other countries has further been [riddled]{.mark}
[with frauds]{.mark}, to say nothing of its explicit use for propaganda
purposes.12 Similarly, the [Kremlin]{.mark} is [exploiting the
pandemic]{.mark} to highlight how the European Union is failing its
mandates.13 While this is consistent with the [Kremlin's
info]{.mark}rmation [op]{.mark}erations as we saw in the 2016 election,
it has palpably [escalated its propaganda efforts during the COVID
pandemic]{.mark} by intentionally propping up radical right
conversations that promote the dissolution of the EU]{.underline}

**Foreign disinformation campaigns decrease vaccination rates. We need
to implement the plan now**

Meaning of the study [[Foreign disinformation campaigns are robustly
associated with declines in mean vaccination rates.]{.mark} The use of
social media to organise offline action is highly associated with an
increase in public belief in vaccines being unsafe. Both of these
[findings suggest that combating disinfo]{.mark}rmation and
misinformation [regarding vaccine]{.mark}s online is [critical to
reversing the growth in vaccine hesitancy]{.mark} around the
world]{.underline}. These findings are especially salient in the context
of the COVID-19 pandemic, given that the vaccines under development will
require deployment globally to billions of people in the next year[.
P[olicymakers need to begin planning now for ways to work against the
patterns found in this study.]{.mark}]{.underline} [While public
[outreach and education]{.mark} about the importance of vaccines will
likely be the cornerstone of any COVID-19 vaccine deployment, we argue
that the findings in this paper show that such efforts are [empirically
not sufficient]{.mark} even if clearly necessary.]{.underline} Based on
our findings, we argue for an additional two-pronged strategy explicitly
targeting foreign disinformation campaigns and the use of social media
by anti-vaccination groups. [First, [governments must mandate that
social media companies are responsible for taking down antivaccination
content]{.mark} (whether originating from genuine domestic actors or
foreign propaganda operations).]{.underline} This is obviously easier
said than done and involves both legal and technical hurdles. However,
authoritarian states provide an ironic roadmap despite the chilling
implications for free speech: they have consistently been successful at
pressing technology companies into policing speech on their behalf
within their borders. [[Where there is political will]{.mark}, [there is
the capacity for removing content damaging public health]{.mark}.
Second, [foreign disinformation campaigns should be addressed at their
source.]{.mark} A preponderance of such [campaigns amplifying
anti-vaccination content originate from within Russia]{.mark} or via
pseudo-state actors informally associated with Russia. The utilisation
of information warfare on the internet is a broad issue that has little
hope of general resolution. However, given the [global nature of the
COVID-19 crisis and the fact that pushing anti-vaccination propaganda
will tangibly cause civilian deaths around the world]{.mark}---and in
Russia---there is a chance that, with sufficient pressure and
incentivisation, diplomacy could produce a ceasefire of sorts with
regard to this specific genre of disinformation. [We urge]{.mark}
[policymakers]{.mark} to take the time before a COVID-19 vaccine is
available for mass distribution as an opportunity [for action against
social media factors contributing to vaccine
hesitancy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Online [misinfo]{.mark}rmation on websites can also [**negatively
impact** people's willingness to take vaccines]{.mark}. According to the
Pew Research Center, 55% of Americans with access to the internet sought
[health or med]{.mark}ical [info]{.mark}rmation [online]{.mark} with
some reporting that the information they obtained [influenced their
health behaviors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unfortunately, content on health
websites varies in accuracy and quality with approximately 6% of those
examined containing incorrect information \[[21](javascript:;)[\].
[Anti-vaccination websites]{.mark} take many forms from activism to
natural health sites to general news and blogging sites, with some sites
[receiving 1.5 million unique visitors per month]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[[22](javascript:;)\]. [This is unsurprising since researchers found
that [43% of websites]{.mark} propagated during a web search [for
"vaccination" and "immunization]{.mark}" [comprised of anti-vaccination
websites]{.mark}]{.underline} \[[15](javascript:;)\]. [Once led to
websites, readers may be bombarded with information that questions
scientific integrity, use emotive appeals for civil liberties, and
concern for the health and welfare of children.]{.underline}
Anti-vaccination persuasion centers on creating a community affected by
vaccines and vaccine-related practices \[[23](javascript:;)\]. Main
themes used by anti-vaccine champions include safety and effectiveness,
alternative medicine, freedom and rights, conspiracy theories, and
morality \[[14](javascript:;)\].

SOCIAL MEDIA

[One of the most efficient methods of spreading vaccine misinformation
online is through social media]{.underline}. [A report by the Centre for
Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that social media accounts by
[anti-vaccination proponents gained 7.8 million followers since
2019]{.mark}, with 31 million Facebook users following anti-vaccination
accounts and 17 million YouTube users subscribing to similar
accounts]{.underline} \[[24](javascript:;)\]. [In examining vaccine
chatter on Facebook, researchers found that though anti-vaccination
clusters were fewer in numbers than pro-vaccination clusters, they
nevertheless had very high presence and were well entangled with
undecided clusters]{.underline} \[[25](javascript:;)\]. [One study found
that [public use of social media]{.mark} to organize action was
[associated with the belief]{.mark} [that vaccines were unsafe and that
**foreign disinformation campaign**]{.mark}**s** on social media were
**[associated with lower vaccination rates]{.mark}** and negative
discourse/posts on social media]{.underline} \[[26](javascript:;)\].
Another study examined coverage of the human papilloma virus (HPV)
vaccine in social media and state-level HPV vaccine coverage[. Results
showed that exposure to information on social media explained a higher
proportion of the variance in vaccine coverage compared to socioeconomic
factors, and that vaccine coverage was lower in states with higher
exposure to misinformation, conspiracy theories, and safety
concerns]{.underline} \[[27](javascript:;)\].

COVID-19 VACCINE-RELATED MISINFORMATION

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is especially important to be
aware of the prevalence and role that online misinformation is having on
people's attitudes and behaviors as this affects willingness to get the
COVID-19 vaccine. News of the availability and near dissemination of the
recently developed and tested vaccines began to circulate in headlines
and social media posts. Subsequently, misinformation and conspiracies
about the COVID-19 vaccine gained traction
\[[28](javascript:;), [29](javascript:;)\]. Investigators who examined
media consumption and reliance on specific institutions regarding
COVID-19 found that reliance on certain news formats and sources was
associated with knowledge, misinformation, and prejudice
\[[30](javascript:;)\]. [The amount of [misinfo]{.mark}rmation online
surrounding the vaccine has been labeled as a second pandemic and has
[fueled]{.mark} the [mistrust]{.mark} surrounding the handling of the
pandemic, which can [undermine efforts to vaccinate]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[[31](javascript:;)\]. Surveys of adults about getting the COVID-19
vaccine showed reluctance in doing so. [The report by CCDH noted that
[one in six]{.mark} British [would get vaccinated]{.mark} for COVID-19
\[[24](javascript:;)\] and an even higher number of Americans, **[four
in]{.mark} [ten]{.mark}**, stated they definitely or probably [would not
get the COVID-19 vaccine]{.mark}]{.underline} \[[32](javascript:;)\].
[In a randomized control study, participants who were exposed to
snippets of social media posts containing COVID-19 misinformation had a
decrease in intent to obtain the vaccine compared to controls who were
exposed to factual COVID-19 information]{.underline}

#### Vaccines are also crucial to stopping future pandemics---but reassuring the public about their safety is crucial:

[[Vaccination is a powerful method of disease
prevention]{.underline}]{.mark} that is relevant to people of all ages
and in all countries, as the Covid-19 pandemic illustrates. Vaccination
can improve people's chances of survival, protect communities from new
and reemerging health threats, and enhance societal productivity. [[But
achieving the promise of vaccination requires]{.mark} much more than the
vaccines themselves. It requires]{.underline} appropriate incentives to
encourage the timely discovery and development of innovative, effective,
safe, and affordable products; effective financing and delivery
programs; and [[credible scientific leaders who]{.mark} can]{.underline}
provide evidence-based policy recommendations and [[**reassure the
public**]{.mark} about the value of the vaccines]{.underline}. Since its
inception 50 years ago, the National Academy of Medicine (NAM),
previously known as the Institute of Medicine (IOM), has been an
authoritative resource on medical issues, including vaccination, and a
global leader in vaccine-policy development. FDA Licensure Dates for
Selected Innovative Vaccines since 1970. [It's hard to overstate the
benefits that innovative vaccines deployed in the past five decades have
had on]{.underline} morbidity and [mortality]{.underline} (see
timeline).1 The incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases among U.S.
children has decreased dramatically, an achievement that is attributable
in part to high vaccine-coverage rates. By the 2018--2019 school year,
coverage rates among kindergarteners exceeded 90% in all but two states,
according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). Four vaccine-preventable illnesses have been eliminated from the
Americas: smallpox in 1971, poliomyelitis in 1994, and rubella and
congenital rubella syndrome in 2015 (one of us is an executive vice
president at Merck, which produces vaccines for rubella, among other
vaccines). Moreover, between 2011 and 2020, immunization programs in
low-income countries saved an estimated 23.3 million lives.2 Perhaps the
most notable immunization-related accomplishment during the past half
century was the eradication of smallpox, which was verified by the World
Health Organization (WHO) in 1980. In addition, global cases of
paralytic polio have decreased by 99.95% from the estimated 350,000
cases in 1988,3 when the global polio-eradication program was announced,
and two of the three wild-type polioviruses, WPV types 2 and 3, have
been eradicated. Other important achievements during this period include
the 1986 approval of the first vaccine based on recombinant technology,
a hepatitis B vaccine that not only has reduced rates of the infection
in many countries but was also the first vaccine to reduce cancer risk.
In 1987, the first polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine was
licensed; since then, the incidence of invasive Haemophilus influenzae
type b disease among children has fallen dramatically. In 2009, a
vaccine for Neisseria meningitidis group A became the first licensed
vaccine specifically designed for certain people in low-income
countries. Achieving broad population health benefits associated with
vaccination requires effective policies that create incentives for
vaccine development, ensure financing of vaccines, and improve access.
After a measles outbreak in 1989--1991, the U.S. Vaccines for Children
Program was authorized in 1993 to ensure that eligible children would
have free access to all CDC-recommended vaccines. To address remaining
gaps, the IOM in 2000 issued a landmark report that recommended policy
and programmatic improvements to strengthen U.S. immunization programs.
One outcome of this effort was the requirement included in the 2010
Affordable Care Act that plans provide first-dollar coverage (coverage
without copayments or other cost sharing) for vaccines recommended by
the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for children and
adults up to age 26. [Policy advances have also enhanced the effects of
vaccination globally]{.underline}. The WHO launched the Expanded Program
on Immunization in 1974 to increase access to vaccines. Beginning in
2000, the benefits of this program were greatly enhanced by the creation
of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, an international public--private
partnership that provides financial and programmatic support to ensure
that children in the poorest countries have access to vaccines. In 2017,
with the support of the NAM and other organizations, this model was used
as a framework for the creation of the Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations to fund innovative vaccines and other
countermeasures against pathogens that cause devastating public health
consequences, such as the Ebola virus and now SARS-CoV-2. Because
vaccines are usually administered to healthy people, maintaining the
highest safety standards isn't only an ethical imperative but is also
essential to sustaining public trust. [[The story of vaccine progress
has been punctuated by]{.mark} both real and misguided [safety
concerns]{.mark} for as long as vaccines have been in use.]{.underline}
Such concerns have included adverse events associated with vaccination
itself, quality lapses in the manufacturing process, and false alarms
regarding vaccine safety. The potential for financial gain has fueled
liability suits related to putative safety concerns. The NAM has
conducted ongoing objective assessments of vaccine safety to help
address concerns. Between 2000 and 2004, its Immunization Safety Review
Committee evaluated evidence pertinent to various vaccine-safety topics
and set a new standard for independent scientific review that remains
relevant as the NAM contributes to coronavirus-related policies.
[[Vaccine confidence depends on trust in the safety and efficacy
of]{.mark} the [products]{.mark} themselves]{.underline}, trust in
vaccine manufacturers and the clinicians who administer vaccines, and
trust in policymakers who assess the scientific evidence and promulgate
vaccination recommendations. [[Failure]{.mark}s in any of these areas
[can have substantial long-term public health consequences, as was the
case with misinfo]{.mark}rmation [about measles
vaccines]{.mark}]{.underline}. Enduring mistrust stemming from a
discredited study that associated childhood vaccination with autism has
been linked to recent outbreaks of measles in the United States.
Sustaining both vaccine safety and trust in vaccination will become
increasingly complex. Vaccines continue to be approved, and more
vaccines have become accessible in resource-limited countries, but
safety surveillance systems are less evolved in many low-income regions
than in high-income regions. Similarly, vaccines are being manufactured
in regions where regulatory oversight isn't always optimal, and
counterfeit vaccines remain a threat. Emerging infections may require
rapid availability of new vaccines before comprehensive safety studies
are complete. Perhaps most important, the speed and reach of
communication on social media platforms have created unprecedented
opportunities for users to amplify misinformation and flame the fears of
parents and other stakeholders in the immunization ecosystem. Moving
forward, [[vaccines against a range of infectious agents will need to be
developed. New]{.mark} and reemerging [pathogens]{.mark}]{.underline},
such as SARS-CoV-2 and new influenza strains, [[regularly
appear]{.underline}]{.mark}. Viruses that are capable of spreading by
vector or airborne routes --- one of the most important pandemic threats
--- continue to emerge. More than 1.5 million as yet unknown viruses are
estimated to exist in animals worldwide, and 38 to 50% of them are
candidates to spread to humans.4 Global-surveillance and virus-discovery
programs are therefore important, and they may be able to predict
pandemics. In 2011, the IOM commissioned the development of a strategic
multiattribute ranking tool for vaccines to facilitate evaluation of new
vaccine targets and help guide decisions about prioritizing
vaccine-development efforts. When pandemics emerge, rapid responses are
necessary. Vaccines aren't the only available tool: passive
administration of antibodies for prevention or treatment of infectious
diseases has been used for many years. The Pandemic Prevention Platform
program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency aims to develop
a new form of passive antibody protection that can slow viral epidemics
starting within 60 days after identification of the pathogen and until a
vaccine can be made. Thanks to new technology, the vaccine-development
process is also being condensed. Experimental vaccines were developed
and ready for phase 1 clinical trials in 20 months for SARS after the
epidemic began in 2003 and in slightly more than 3 months for Zika virus
in 2016. [[The response to]{.mark} the [Covid]{.mark}-19 pandemic [is
a]{.mark} prime [example of how rapidly]{.mark} new [vaccines can now be
designed]{.mark}]{.underline}. By the time the WHO declared Covid-19 a
pandemic on March 11, 2020, at least 37 groups from biotechnology
companies and academic institutions were working on vaccine candidates.5
These candidates include live attenuated, inactivated, DNA, messenger
RNA, viral vector, and spike-protein--based vaccines. Less than 1 year
later, the first Covid-19 vaccine-efficacy trials have now been
completed, and the first vaccines are authorized for emergency use. Many
approved vaccines, such as those against measles and polio, were made
using attenuated or killed versions of the virus without detailed
knowledge of viral pathogenesis. In contrast, current strategies for
vaccine design rely on new technologies that lead to a deeper
understanding of the immune system and of host--pathogen interactions.
For new experimental HIV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines,
a detailed structural understanding of antibody interactions with the
HIV envelope or the RSV prefusion form of the fusion (F) protein is
needed. [[Vaccines remain **the most effective tool** for **preventing**
]{.mark}**infectious [diseases ]{.mark}**[and improving global
health.]{.mark} **Remarkable progress** has been made with the use of
vaccines]{.underline}, including the eradication of smallpox and the
control of childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, and
polio. New insights into the functioning of the immune system on a
cellular and molecular level have made possible the rapid development of
new vaccines. Difficulties facing vaccinologists include predicting the
type and timing of the next pandemic; developing vaccines to combat
rapidly changing pathogens such as HIV-1, influenza, and
multidrug-resistant bacteria; and establishing rapid-response strategies
to control emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. [The future
holds **great promise** for **vaccine-mediated control of global
pathogens**]{.underline}, but providing affordable access to effective
vaccines for everyone who could benefit from them remains an important
challenge.

[The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which is causing [COVID 19]{.mark}
disease[, has taught]{.mark} us unexpected [lessons about the dangers of
human extinction through]{.mark} highly contagious and lethal
[disease]{.mark}s. As the COVID 19 pandemic is now being controlled by
various isolation measures, therapeutics and vaccines, it became clear
that [our]{.mark} [current lifestyle]{.mark} and societal functions may
[not]{.mark} be [sustainable in the long term]{.mark}]{.underline}. We
[now [have to start]{.mark} thinking and [planning]{.mark} on how [to
face the next]{.mark} dangerous [pandemic, not just overcoming the one
that is upon us]{.mark} now. [Is there]{.mark} any [ev]{.mark}idence
[that]{.mark} even [worse pandemics could strike]{.mark} us in the near
future [and threaten the existence of the human race?]{.mark} The answer
is unequivocally [yes]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is not necessary to get
infected by viruses of bats, pangolins and other exotic animals that
live in remote forests in order to be in danger. Creditable scientific
evidence indicates that the human gut microbiota harbor billions of
viruses which are capable of affecting the function of vital human
organs such as the immune system, lung, brain, liver, kidney, heart etc.
It is possible that the development of pathogenic variants in the gut
can lead to contagious viruses which can cause pandemics, leading to
destruction of vital organs, causing death or various debilitating
diseases such as blindness, respiratory, liver, heart and kidney
failures. [These [diseases could result n]{.mark} the [complete shutdown
of]{.mark} our [civilization and]{.mark} probably [the extinction of
human race]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this essay, I will first provide a
few independent pieces of scientific facts and then combine this
information to come up with some (but certainly not all) hypothetical
scenarios that could cause human race misery, even extinction. I hope
that these scary scenarios will trigger preventative measures that could
reverse or delay the projected adverse outcomes.

#### Misinformation affects underserved communities the most

[A last area with a dearth of systematic empirical work are mechanisms
to reach audiences that are often underserved by traditional channels
for science communication. [Newspapers, science television, or even
science museums]{.mark}, for instance, tend to [reach more educated and
higher-income audiences]{.mark}
([11](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1805871115#core-r11)).
Furthermore, from [work dating back to]{.mark} the [1970s on widening
knowledge gaps,]{.mark} we also [know that citizens with higher
socioeconomic status]{.mark} (levels of education and income) are [able
to learn more efficiently]{.mark} from new information than their
peers]{.underline}. [As a result, quality scientific information is not
only more likely to reach more educated and higher-income audiences,
but, when it does, the ability of citizens with higher socioeconomic
status to process new information more efficiently can further widen
existing gaps between the already information-rich and the
information-poor.]{.underline}

[Our [inability to reach all segments of the population]{.mark} equally
well with high-quality scientific information is particularly
[troubling]{.mark}, given that the [need for antidotes to
misinformation]{.mark} might be particularly pronounced among certain
groups of the public. One indicator of this [problem is]{.mark} the
educational and [income gaps related to seeing fake news]{.mark} as a
problem in the first place. In a 2016 Pew survey after the US
presidential election
([28](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1805871115#core-r28)),
almost three in four Americans ([73%]{.mark}) [with a household income
over \$75,000]{.mark} [thought that completely made-up news
caused]{.mark} "a great deal" of [confusion]{.mark}. Comparatively,
fewer than three in five ([58%) respondents with a household income of
\$30,000 shared that concern]{.mark}]{.underline}. However,
socioeconomic gaps also emerge with respect to people's confidence in
their own ability to spot fake news in the first place. A 2018 US survey
commissioned by *The Economist* asked respondents about their ability to
distinguish real and fake news
([96](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1805871115#core-r96));
83% of respondents with a family income of at least \$100,000 felt "very
confident" or "somewhat confident" that they could "tell real news from
fake news." Among respondents with an income of less than \$50,000, that
number dropped to 63%.

or are unsure about at least half of the statements, 3 times the share
of Democrats in that category (14%). Independent voters were not
factored into the survey results.

The topline results show: [Sixty percent of adults say they\'ve heard
that the government is exaggerating the number of COVID-19 deaths by
counting deaths due to other factors and either believe it to be true
(38%) or aren\'t sure if it\'s true (22%).]{.underline} Four in 10 (39%)
respondents say they\'ve heard that pregnant women should not get the
COVID-19 vaccine and believe it to be true (17%) or aren\'t sure if
it\'s true (22%). Three in 10 (31%) say they\'ve heard that the vaccine
has been shown to cause infertility and either believe it (8%) or
aren\'t sure if it\'s true (23%). Thirty-five percent of respondents say
they\'ve heard that the government is hiding deaths from the COVID-19
vaccine; 18% believe it, and 17% say they\'re not sure if it\'s tru.
Other statements attract less but substantial support: Twenty-eight
percent of respondents have heard that the antiparasitic drug ivermectin
is a safe and effective treatment for COVID; 14% believe it, 14% are not
sure if it\'s true. Twenty-four percent of Americans have heard that you
can get COVID from the vaccine; 14% believe that to be true, while 10%
are unsure. [Twenty-four percent of respondents have heard that the
vaccines contain microchips; 7% believe it, 17% say they\'ve heard that
but don\'t know if it\'s true.]{.underline} Twenty-one percent of
Americans have heard claims that the vaccine can change DNA or don\'t
know if it\'s true. Misinformation by News Source. The report notes that
\"people\'s trusted news sources are correlated with their belief in
COVID-19 misinformation.\" At least a third of those who trust
information from CNN, MSNBC, NPR, and local and network TV news do not
believe any of the eight false statements. Depending on their mix of
these news sources, only 11%-16% of this group believe or are unsure
about at least four of the eight false statements. In contrast, 36% of
people who trust Fox News, 37% of those who trust One America News, and
46% of those who trust Newsmax say they believe or are unsure about at
least half of the eight false statements. It\'s also notable that 44% of
people who trust NPR, 48% of those who trust MSNBC, 50% of those who
trust network news, and 49% of those who trust CNN believe or are unsure
about one to three of the false statements. While larger shares of
people who trust COVID information from conservative news sources
believe misinformation, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the
researchers say the survey cannot explain those beliefs. \"Whether this
is because people are exposed to misinformation from those news sources,
or whether the types of people who choose those news sources are the
same ones who are pre-disposed to believe certain types of
misinformation for other reasons, is beyond the scope of the analysis,\"
they write. The poll results show the role partisanship plays in which
networks are trusted. Democrats trust COVID-19 information from network
(72%) and local (66%) television, CNN (65%), MSNBC (56%), and NPR (51%).
Republicans\' most trusted news sources for COVID-19 information are Fox
News (49%), local (34%) and network (25%) news, and Newsmax (22%). Few
adults say they trust social-media sources for COVID-19 information,
such as YouTube (13%), Facebook (9%), Twitter (6%), and Instagram (5%).
However, the researchers write that the groups influenced by information
they see on those platforms may be larger than these percentages
indicate, as previous KFF surveys have found that nearly as many adults
get information about COVID-19 vaccines from social media as from cable,
network, and local TV news. Partisan COVID Mortality Gap. Wherever
people get their news, misinformation that determines their attitudes
about COVID-19 and the vaccines has likely had real-world consequences.
According to a recent article in The New York Times, a gap between the
higher COVID death tolls in more Republican areas and lower death tolls
in more Democratic areas of the country has developed in 2021 --- with
an association emerging between attitudes toward the COVID vaccines and
the resulting willingness to be vaccinated between those regions. In
October, the Times reports, 25 out of every 100,000 residents of
counties that voted heavily for Donald Trump in the last presidential
election died from COVID. That\'s 3 times higher than the mortality rate
in counties that strongly supported Joe Biden (7.8 per 100,000).

#### Herd immunity key to keep disease in control

[Acquired
immunity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/adaptive-immune-system) is
established at the level of the individual, either through natural
infection with a pathogen or through immunization with a vaccine. [[Herd
immunity]{.mark} (]{.underline}[[Box
1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320301709#tbox1))
stems from the effects of individual immunity scaled to the level of the
population. It [refers to the indirect protection from infection
conferred to susceptible individuals when a sufficiently large
proportion of immune individuals exist in a population.]{.mark} This
population-level effect is often considered in the context of
[vaccination programs]{.mark}, which a[im to establish herd immunity so
that those who cannot be vaccinated]{.mark}, including the very young
and immunocompromised, [are still protected against
disease]{.mark}.]{.underline} Depending on the prevalence of existing
immunity to a pathogen in a population, the introduction of an infected
individual will lead to different outcomes
([Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320301709#fig1)).
In a completely naive population, a pathogen will propagate through
susceptible hosts in an unchecked manner following effective exposure of
susceptible hosts to infected individuals[. However, [if a fraction of
the population has immunity to that same pathogen]{.mark}, [the
likelihood of an effective contact between infected and susceptible
hosts is reduced]{.mark}, since many hosts are immune and, therefore,
cannot transmit the pathogen]{.underline}. If the fraction of
susceptible individuals in a population is too few, then the pathogen
cannot successfully spread, and its prevalence will decline. The point
at which the proportion of susceptible individuals falls below the
threshold needed for transmission is known as the herd immunity
threshold ([Anderson and May,
1985](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320301709#bib1)).
Above this level of immunity, herd immunity begins to take effect, and
susceptible individuals benefit from indirect protection from infection
([Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320301709#fig1)B).

[Downside risks, however, remain significant.]{.underline} Outbreaks
could recur in places that appear to have gone past peak infection,
requiring the reimposition of at least some containment measures[. A
more [prolonged decline in activity]{.mark} could [lead to further
scarring]{.mark}, including from wider firm closures, as [surviving
firms hesitate to hire jobseekers]{.mark} after extended unemployment
spells, and as [unemployed workers leave the labor force]{.mark}
entirely]{.underline}. Financial conditions may again tighten as in
January--March, exposing vulnerabilities among borrowers. [This could
[tip]{.mark} some [economies into debt crises]{.mark} and slow activity
further. More generally, cross-border [spillovers from weaker external
demand and tighter financial conditions]{.mark} could [further]{.mark}
[magnify the impact of country]{.mark}- or region-specific shocks [on
global growth]{.mark}. Moreover, the sizable policy response following
the initial sudden stop in activity may end up being prematurely
withdrawn or improperly targeted due to design and implementation
challenges, [lead]{.mark}ing [t]{.mark}o [misallocation and the
dissolution of productive economic relationships]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Some of these aspects are featured in the Scenario Box, which presents
growth projections under alternative scenarios[. Beyond pandemic-related
downside risks, escalating tensions between the United States and China
on multiple fronts, frayed relationships among the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)+ coalition of oil producers, and
widespread social unrest pose additional challenges to the global
economy.]{.underline} Moreover, against a backdrop of low inflation and
high debt (particularly in advanced economies), protracted weak
aggregate demand could lead to further disinflation and debt service
difficulties that, in turn, weigh further on activity.

===\[last part also talks about cohesion key!\] Russian disinfo is high
now b/c of the war & false narratives they've spread in the past, so
it's up to NATO's cohesion (and coordinating capabilities), credibility,
expertise, guidance, financial support, mandates, and the ability for
them to create a global snowball to organizations and nations to counter
it.

One of the founding myths of Russian foreign policy (developed below)
relates to a betrayal by the West. Many in Russia are either unwilling
or too scared to challenge the veracity of this tale since it has become
national dogma. As the freedom of speech constitutes one of the
fundamental and respected rights of democracies, this myth is also
widely spread throughout the West. [Moreover, the West's culture of open
debates, which respects differing points of view, puts [Russian]{.mark}
masterminds of [false narratives]{.mark} in a [privileged]{.mark}
position when it comes to influencing Western societies and their
decision-making processes.]{.underline} **[It also renders [NATO]{.mark}
and EU countries [increasingly vulnerable]{.mark} to influence from
pro-Kremlin propagandists spurred on by an unbridled sense of initiative
and combined [with]{.mark} active measures as well as armed
[conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [The matrix of the myth of Western
betrayal and Russian self-victimisation is the "broken promise of not
enlarging NATO to the East". The Kremlin has also used this myth to
justify the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 -- a move
that has potentially incalculable consequences for European and even
global security.]{.underline} This new stage in Russia's confrontational
policy has been further solidified with support from the increasingly
belligerent Belarusian dictator although Alyaksandr Lukashenka's
standing has also been weakened through his complete dependence on
Russia. Minsk, assisted in turn by Moscow, created a migration crisis on
the Belarusian border with Poland, Lithuania and, to a lesser extent,
Latvia, thereby opening an additional hybrid front. **[Increased tension
on NATO's entire eastern flank and the war waged by Russia against
Ukraine have been exacerbated by Russian [and]{.mark} Belarusian
[hostile disinformation]{.mark} activities, which are [unprecedented in
terms of scope, intensity and toxicity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [In both
Russia and Belarus, the highest political authorities, diplomats,
state-controlled media, special services and their proxies have been
**actively involved in spreading familiar but intensified false
narratives as well as new concoctions that are particularly harmful to
the public** in the Russian-language, state-controlled information
environment. **Unfortunately, some of [these narratives]{.mark} fall on
fertile ground in certain circles in the West and [are]{.mark} cynically
[exploited in]{.mark} local [political struggles]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
[The goal of [disinformation]{.mark} is to **[undo]{.mark} the
[cohesion]{.mark} of the transatlantic community, undermine the
[credibility of NATO]{.mark} and EU members [and]{.mark}, ultimately,
[derail]{.mark} the existing rules-based [international
order]{.mark}.**]{.underline} **[The "new-old" story is that: Russia,
and now Belarus, are surrounded by foes, and the heightened security
crisis is the fault of the West, which had been allegedly pushing
Ukraine towards war.]{.underline}** Having rejected the Minsk
agreements, Ukraine had been preparing to launch military operations
against the inhabitants of Donbas, occupied Crimea and regions in Russia
itself; to this end, Kyiv had been concentrating its forces and
resources (including weapon systems received from NATO countries) in the
east of the country. Polish and American mercenaries were also operating
and preparing armed provocations in the east of Ukraine; this means that
not only Ukraine but also the West itself had been preparing to attack
the Russian Federation and Belarus. Ukraine had been mobilising troops
on the border with Belarus, against which Poland has been making
territorial claims. Finally, Vladimir Putin justified his illegal
assault on Ukraine with the need to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine.
He did so despite the fact that the Ukrainian nation lost 8 million
people in World War II fighting Nazi Germany and is a country led by a
Jewish president who won the popular vote in a free, fair and democratic
election; an election which showed the Ukrainian neo-Nazi parties having
less support than probably anywhere else in Europe.

Although it is not easy to measure, [the pernicious nature of Russian
disinformation and interference abroad has been "tested" positively in
several cases, with prime examples including the attacks against
Ukraine, the U.S. and French presidential elections, as well as the
Brexit referendum]{.underline}. The extent to which social polarisation
and internal political fights are causal effects of Russian (and others)
meddling in the West could be discussed elsewhere, but what is of
importance for this paper is that such **[frictions are certainly being
exploited and amplified by the opportunistic organisers of external
disinformation.]{.underline}** In any case, the cumulative result can be
seen, for example, [in Slovakia where a significant part of the society
blames the Alliance for the current Russian crisis]{.underline} (at
least that had been the case before the full-scale war against Ukraine
started) or in [Croatia where the president has been questioning the
Alliance's Eastern policy.]{.underline} [The actions of candidates for
the highest political positions in France who propagate anti-NATO
slogans are even more concerning.]{.underline} Sympathy for the Russian
regime is shown by representatives of ruling or co-ruling parties in
NATO and EU member states, including Fidesz in Hungary and Podemos in
Spain (which should be particularly sensitive to disinformation
following the Kremlin's interference in the Catalan independence
question). Moscow uses other tools to exert its influence in Western
countries, but their effect may be more prevalent in countries with
elected parties that have pro-Kremlin inclinations (e.g., AfD in
Germany). Russia has been known to drive political corruption, use
blackmail tactics and even resort to acts of terrorism. The growing
popularity of conspiratorial and pro-Kremlin narratives in Germany,
France and Spain that are spread through encrypted social channels
linked to Moscow have become a fact of everyday life. While it is
challenging to fully assess how effective countermeasures to tackle
foreign interference have been, examples from countries that have taken
them up with determination show that the fight against foreign meddling
can have a genuine impact. Most ways and means of counteracting
disinformation in this political warfare fall under the responsibility
of sovereign states (and the European Union due to its legislative
prerogatives). It is predominantly their responsibility to build
resistance to disinformation and to respond to it with both deterrence
and punishment. NATO's role in this regard is limited. At the same time,
the Alliance -- as an organisation at the centre of false accusations
and hostile propaganda -- knows how to defend itself, which is evidenced
by the overall high level of public support for NATO among its members.
Nevertheless, it seems that the **[Alliance's [potential to combat
disinformation]{.mark} is not fully utilised by its individual members,
which could [benefit from NATO's expertise and coordinating capabilities
to a greater extent]{.mark} than they have thus far.]{.underline}**

[Tackling disinformation remains an essential part of [NATO]{.mark}'s
communication strategies and day-to-day operations, which includes media
monitoring, analysis of the information space and proactive
communication in a coordinated and fact-based manner. **Its goal is to
inoculate or "[pre-bunk]{.mark}" the mediasphere rather than debunk each
[false claim]{.mark}, i.a. through "Setting the Record Straight"
narratives and activities which counter the Kremlin's myths about
NATO.**]{.underline} In 2019, NATO adopted an updated and systematic
package of appropriate objectives and measures to combat disinformation.
The following year, NATO's Response to Disinformation on COVID-19 became
realised in an Action Plan issued to Allies by the Secretary General.
This document sought to bring together multiple strands of work on
countering hostile disinformation surrounding COVID-19. In 2021, NATO's
Toolbox for Countering Hostile Information Activities was created; it
reflects the Alliance's twin-track model to respond to hostile
information activities: "understand" and "engage", underpinned by
"coordination". The document aims to provide Allies with a toolbox to
assess hostile information activities, including disinformation, and to
assist in determining possible courses of action. Furthermore, NATO IS
staff holds biweekly briefings on Russian and other disinformation
activities at various relevant committees. Within the Civil Emergency
Planning Committee, as part of a long-term effort, and covering
resilience baselines -- spanning across many domains including
communications -- Allies share information about how prepared they are
to face various key civil security challenges, including disinformation.
**[The organisation [supports]{.mark} member and partner [states
by]{.mark} providing [guidance as well as]{.mark} co-[financing]{.mark}
for social and scientific projects that strengthen their resilience to
disinformation.]{.underline}** Rapid-reaction teams have been made
available to member states as part of NATO's strategy to fight hybrid
threats. The organisation is also cooperating more closely with the
European Union to ensure that NATO benefits from the EU's Rapid Alert
System set up to counter disinformation.

At the same time, the West has yet to prepare a coherent, comprehensive
and coordinated response to Russian disinformation. [It is up to nations
to fully utilise NATO's potential.]{.underline} A response practice has
been developed and seen partial success within some states and
Euro-Atlantic institutions, but it has not yet been translated into a
real common policy or strategy. At national levels, political
declarations and agreed action plans are still not fully implemented in
too many instances. Western states approach disinformation in varied
ways due to differences in history, regional security, wealth,
education, media quality, political and legal culture and -- most
importantly -- the current state of their relations with Russia. As a
rule, some states prefer bilateral approaches that safeguard national
prerogatives. This may change now following the Russian invasion of
Ukraine. Nevertheless, the challenge of disinformation has begun to
attract higher political attention. In the European Union, this has
transpired through the adoption of the European Democracy Action Plan
and the presentation of new regulations on digital services in December
2020. These regulations aim to address the core issue of the business
model developed by disinformation organisers who instrumentalise social
media platforms. The report by the Special Committee on Foreign
Interference in all Democratic Processes in the EU, including
Disinformation (INGE), has also promised that other means of influence
will be addressed5 . In an effort to combat disinformation, the Digital
Services Act (DSA) is a breakthrough legal instrument that will
fundamentally change the rules of the game for the information
environment in the European Union, member states and partner countries;
it will also have an impact on national approaches worldwide. The DSA
will impose numerous legal obligations on operators of online platforms
that are more demanding than the previous voluntary commitments outlined
in the Code of Practice for Fighting Disinformation. Companies will be
obliged to cooperate with independent researchers and allow them to
access their data. They will also participate in complaint and appeal
procedures regarding content moderation and dispute resolution. The DSA
will provide for the companies' obligatory consultations, including with
civil society organisations. It will also introduce the institution of
trusted whistle blowers, who, among other things, will notify the
companies about suspected crimes online. The act will correspondingly
establish a European Digital Services Council and advisory body made up
of national digital service coordinators responsible for implementing
legislation at the national level. It will impose specific additional
duties on exceptionally large online platforms with more than fortyfive
million users per month. These obligations will include assessing
systemic risks resulting from their services, identifying actions to
reduce such risks, conducting independent audits, setting appropriate
conditions for algorithmic recommendations of user content and ensuring
additional transparency in advertising (including political ads). Among
international organisations and institutions, the European Union plays a
leading role in counteracting disinformation and introducing new
effective measures against it. The future regulations on transparency in
financing political parties and election campaigns gives hope for
limiting corruption and external influence in the affairs of the member
states. NATO and the EU share similar membership compositions and were
created based on comparable value systems, so it is reasonable to assume
that counteracting disinformation will be more prominently reflected in
NATO's new Strategic Concept. A need for this has been suggested by the
authors of the NATO2030 expert group report prepared ahead of the Madrid
Summit in June 2022. As a result, **[countering disinformation could be
given a more visible place on the agenda of NATO ministerial meetings
and summits, and more proposals with clear commitments by member states
to tackle disinformation may be unveiled. [NATO]{.mark} also has the
opportunity to [strengthen the mandates of existing committees to better
coordinate national efforts.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In light of the current security environment in Europe and worldwide,
traditional threats are still a priority, and [collective defence will
remain one of NATO's core missions]{.underline}, even more so than in
the 2010 document. Among the tasks supporting this existing mission,
there will also be development of a full range of instruments aimed at
neutralising new risks, including disinformation. As experience has
shown, threats evolve in terms of intensity, goals, methods and means.
The challenge for the negotiators of NATO's new Strategic Concept will
therefore be to provide for adequate flexibility when crafting current
and future countermeasures that will guide the Alliance's activities for
years to come. [Overall, NATO's (and the West's) coherent response and
efforts against foreign disinformation, both nationally and
internationally, should focus on: (i) their civic resilience, (ii) their
offensive capabilities as much as their defensive ones and (iii)
minimising the differences in how individual Western countries approach
disinformation in practice. In other words, deterrence must be pursued
through both punishment and denial.]{.underline} The following
recommendations apply specifically to NATO but also to other
organisations that can cooperate more with the Alliance as well as the
member states themselves, for which **[[NATO]{.mark} can act as [a
catalyst in]{.mark} the [development of national policies and
practices]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Therefore, where appropriate, [**[Allies should overcome any]{.mark}
remaining reluctance and [uncooperative tendencies that limit]{.mark}
the role of [NATO]{.mark} in combating new threats,** especially hybrid
ones. First, tackling disinformation should gain greater political
attention among all Allies. National countermeasures undertaken in some
member states (e.g., France, Germany, the Baltic States and the UK) or
partner countries (e.g., Finland and Sweden) testify to the importance
they attach to the problem of falsehoods in international
politics.]{.underline} When allowed, **[[NATO]{.mark} could better serve
as [a]{.mark} coordinator and [multiplier of good]{.mark}
practices]{.underline}** (of which these countries are, to a significant
extent, a model). Second, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. The
work ahead can be built on the existing acquis and institutions without
substantial additional resources, which is important given budgetary
constraints. Third, **[there is clearly [more scope and
possibility]{.mark} for NATO [to foster synergies with other
organisations]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- most notably the EU -- in
helping each other and partner countries to fight foreign
disinformation. Overall, NATO and the West must take a more offensive
approach in tackling this ever more dangerous scourge.

card can be used

===definitely not the best card (unless the strat specifically focuses
on the cognitive warfare side of things) but talks about NATO's strategy
in the past and how NATO can work on this w/ disinformation increasing
moving forwards

As NATO moves towards the future, it finds itself confronting the
challenges of a changing world. As noted in the NATO2030 process
(Maizière et al., 2020; NATO, 2021a), [[NATO]{.mark} will [need]{.mark}
to [address]{.mark} a host of returning and emergent challenges such as
[Russia's aggressive act]{.mark}ion[s]{.mark}, the threat of
[terrorism]{.mark}, [cyber-attacks]{.mark}, emerging and [disruptive
tech]{.mark}nologies, the security impact of [climate]{.mark} change,
[and]{.mark} the rise of [China]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[The
[solutions]{.mark} to these challenges [require]{.mark} a delicate
[blend of political and military action]{.mark} married [with]{.mark}
the deep collective [wisdom]{.mark} contained with[in]{.mark} the
[Alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Within the three core missions
specified by NATO's 2010 strategic concept (collective defence, crisis
management and cooperative security) (NATO, 2020d), the Alliance is
focused on five operational imperatives: cognitive superiority, layered
resilience, influence and power projection, cross-domain command, and
integrated multi-domain defence (NATO, 2021c). These imperatives and the
overarching challenges outlined in NATO2030 have led NATO to expand its
operational domains from three (air, land, sea) to include cyber (NATO,
2019) and space (NATO, 2021b). However, a school of thought exists that
has strongly advocated that the cognitive domain should be given equal
importance and noting that it is an area where Alliance nations are
particularly vulnerable (Cole & Le Guyader, 2020). Recent examples of
the ever-growing threat presented by disinformation, misinformation, and
propaganda, including actions taken during the COVID-19 crisis, would
support such an assertion.

NATO's approach, honed over seventy-two years of information conflict,
is based on a traditional approach of **[highlighting concrete actions,
verifiable facts and credible communication]{.underline}**. This
approach relies on clear and consistent narratives passed through
conventional mass media, public engagements and social media. Such an
approach is based on the Alliance's ideals and core values. Trust, once
broken, is hard to regain, so clarity and consistency are central
aspects of this approach. For example (NATO, 2020b), in support of the
Alliance and its partners, "[NATO and Allied armed forces have played a
key role in supporting civilian efforts to fight COVID-19]{.underline},
with some 350 flights delivering hundreds of tons of critical supplies,
the construction of almost 100 field hospitals, and almost half a
million troops across the Alliance securing borders, transporting
patients and helping with testing \[and vaccine delivery\]." It has also
built over twenty-five field hospitals, provided over twenty-five
thousand beds to the Allied nations, and supports sharing medical
supplies and logistics through the NATO Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response
Coordination Centre (EADRCC) (Ozawa, 2020).

[Responding to specific attacks, [NATO provides **widely available
refutations, briefings, talking points, statements, and
corrections**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In response to the COVID-19
infodemic, [NATO **[intensified]{.mark} its [communications
across]{.mark} a wide [range of platforms]{.mark} and media, engaged in
an [increas]{.mark}ing number of online [engagements]{.mark} with a
broad range of audiences**.]{.underline} Also, it expanded outreach
within Russia through various media products. However, **[[this]{.mark}
has [not]{.mark} been [enough]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and NATO has
reached out to academia, industry, NGOs, think tanks, and media watch
organisations to encourage discussion. This can reduce the
susceptibility to disinformation and support a more resilient society.
An engaged, independent, and empowered fourth estate is a necessary part
of this resilience. Only by constant engagement with old and new media
across the Alliance, partners and where possible, social
groups/countries that are the sources can one hope to ensure that
disinformation is successfully countered.

The response to disinformation has been coordinate through the Strategic
Communication Task Force, led by the NATO Public Diplomacy Division
(PPD). An example of NATO's approach may be found in its straightforward
debunking of Russian myths on NATO and COVID-19 (NATO, 2020a). This
strategy faces the recurring issues raised in Russian disinformation
efforts and attempts to answer the accusations in a forward-leaning
fashion.

In the end, NATO has faced the COVID pandemic in two ways (Ozawa, 2020).
The first is by leveraging the power of the military Alliance to support
a global medical emergency, and the second by addressing the infodemic
head-on. The efforts of the S&T community have successfully been brought
to bear on both issues.

No single strategy will work all the time, nor will counter-narrative
strategies be universally successful, as exemplified by the continuing
existence of "flat earth" societies despite irrefutable evidence to the
contrary. NATO's engagement strategy, therefore, [relies on proactive
and rapid communication, highlighting flawed reasoning (debunking),
identifying familiar sources and methods of disinformation, countering
disinformation on the platform or via the media on which it is
found]{.underline}, adapting to the evolution of such disinformation,
being selective in which attacks to counter and consistent in overall
messaging. Not all disinformation can be countered, if for no other
reason than the sheer volume of such occurrences, so selecting those
attacks that can do the most harm or are starting to gain significant
attention is a critical step. [Earning the trust of Alliance societies
through **[consistent communication and provision of information]{.mark}
will help [slow]{.mark} or marginalise the
[remainder]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Fourth, [NATO needs to better adapt to hybrid, grey zone and cognitive
warfare.]{.underline} The battleground of today and the future includes
the sixth operational domain, the cognitive or, more generally, the
human, domain. Russian and Chinese approaches to disinformation have
been successful to some degree, impacting the lives of citizens in the
Alliance and with allies[. In a manner consistent with the values and
ethics that underlie the Alliance, [mastering this]{.mark} domain will
be [essential to]{.mark} maintaining the [Alliance's effectiveness and
reduc]{.mark}ing the risk of [strategic errors]{.mark} with potentially
[disastrous]{.mark} repercussions.]{.underline}

and Technical Information from Russia; "Science Disinformation: On the
Problem of Fake News", Springer, 2-25-2022,
<https://link.springer.com/article/10.3103/S0147688221040092/chuo>

This article is devoted to [an important socio-cultural phenomenon that
undermines public confidence in science, that is, fake science
news.]{.underline} The term fake news is analyzed and data on the
dissemination of fake news on social networks is provided. Information
sources for science news and fake science news are identified. Special
attention is paid to the dissemination of fake science news during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the 2016 word of the year
was post-truth. According to the definition of British linguists, this
concept means circumstances in which objective facts have less influence
on the formation of public opinion than emotions or personal beliefs
\[1\]. This phenomenon arose due to the influence of the media: by
manipulating society, they create a different reality. One of the main
reasons for the post-truth era is the abundance of fake news that the
audience is unable to recognize.

The growing influence of fake news is fueled by a loss of trust in the
authorities, as well as in the media and the journalistic profession in
general. **[[Fake news]{.mark} fills the vacuum for people or
communities offering instant solutions to various
problems.]{.underline}** In their discourse, knowledge, science, facts,
evidence, and rationality are swept aside as the sophistry of the elite.
[With the development of Internet technologies, anyone can become an
author of fake news and begin to **[spread]{.mark} it
[instantly]{.mark}**; any attempt to refute these false facts is
useless.]{.underline} [**Emotions [take over rationalism]{.mark}**,
i.e., people believe what they want to believe. **All this fully applies
to science news.**]{.underline}

Development of the Internet provides an excellent opportunity to promote
scientific knowledge, as well as to educate and disseminate research
results. [If it is credible, science news can be an influential vehicle
for drawing public attention to important issues of our time; otherwise,
**such news [undermines]{.mark} the [credibility of]{.mark} scientific
information and [science]{.mark} in general**.]{.underline}

The **[scientific news problem has been [aggravated by]{.mark} the
[COVID]{.mark}-19 pandemic and the information wave that
followed]{.underline}**. Disinformation about the new disease spread
faster than the pandemic, resulting in the emergence of the phenomenon
of infodemic, i.e., an [[overabundance of]{.mark} both [reliable and
inaccurate information]{.mark}, which [makes]{.mark} it
[difficult]{.mark} for people [to identify]{.mark} [reliable
sources]{.mark}]{.underline}. Infodemic has exacerbated the problem of
fake science news, since almost any message about COVID-19 relates to
science, in particular, to medicine and biology.

In our time, [**[science is more relevant than ever for society]{.mark},
given such important problems of our time as [climate change]{.mark},
the [energy]{.mark} supply, and the [global]{.mark} spread of [viral
infections]{.mark}**. Science news is a key resource for helping the
public understand new scientific knowledge and the latest technological
advances. The media, including social media, mediate relationships
between people and technological development and help them to understand
the new world by playing the role of a science conduit.]{.underline}
According to the reach of the audience, the main channels for the
receipt of science news can be divided into sources for professionals
(scientists) and sources for society as a whole (Fig. 5). Accordingly,
professional sources of information (mostly scientific articles) are the
main channels for obtaining information for popular scientific
publications and news agencies. It is difficult to judge the quality of
scientific articles, but an article in a scientific journal is most
likely to be peer reviewed, which makes it a more reliable source of
news. However, this is compounded by the fact that the quality of
scientific journals can vary significantly and some journals publish
research without peer review. \[figure omitted\]

[The most popular science fake news over the years has been vaccine
manufacturer conspiracy theories and denial of man-made climate
destruction.]{.underline} Vaccines are considered one of the most
important inventions ever made for the benefit of humanity. The World
Health Organization estimates that vaccines save 2--3 million lives
every year. However, a **[fabricated scientific article that claimed
that the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine causes autism \[26\] led to
widespread dissemination of this misinformation]{.underline}**,
especially through social media. This, in turn, led not only to record
levels of measles incidence in Europe in 2018, but also expanded the
range of so-called anti-vaxxers \[27\].

**[The denial of anthropogenic climate change, which is dismissed as
fake science without any evidence, has led to universal acceptance of
the international agreement on climate change being lost, and its
[impact]{.mark} on global warming is likely to be [disastrous around the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[28\].

One of the most widely replicated fakes is the so-called flat Earth
theory. Tens of thousands of videos, social media accounts, podcasts,
and websites are devoted to this absurd theory \[29, 30\]. Today, when
space probes are exploring the planets of the solar system, such
"scientific" information can only cause confusion.

In general, the coronavirus pandemic has spawned a host of **[conspiracy
theories and fake science news]{.underline}**, which can be roughly
divided into the following categories:

• the [origin]{.underline} of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (bat soup, a
laboratory leak, creation of the virus by Bill Gates or the US
Government);

• [racial theory]{.underline} (for example, only Asians are infected
with the virus);

• the [spread]{.underline} of coronavirus (5G networks);

• [treatment]{.underline} and prevention of coronavirus (alcohol
consumption; rinsing with chlorine dioxide; bleach injections; swimming
in a pool with chlorinated water; eating garlic, ginger, sesame oil,
bananas; using cocaine; washing hands and rubbing surfaces with baby
urine; warming up the nose with a hairdryer; taking baths with granite);

• [politics]{.underline} (governments hiding the real deaths from
coronavirus and falsifying vaccinations; the increase in the incidence
in Europe is caused by illegal migrants);

• [epidemiology]{.underline} and statistics (overestimated/
underestimated statistics on morbidity and mortality);

• [vaccines]{.underline} and vaccinations (death after vaccination; mass
vaccination for the sake of obtaining superprofits by corporations; the
contents of heavy metals in the vaccine).

Most readers probably found this news funny, but there are examples
where [such messages caused serious harm to health and even led to
death]{.underline}. As an example, by the end of March 2020, over 2100
Iranians had been poisoned by oral methanol. Iran, as an Islamic
country, has strict restrictions on alcohol consumption, but in this
case patients said that, according to information on social networks,
SARS-CoV-2 infection can be prevented with alcohol. As a result, almost
900 patients poisoned with illegal alcohol were admitted to the
intensive care unit and 296 of them died \[36\].

With the development of science and technology, there has been a clear
increase in interest in science and scientific research. On the one
hand, society is aware of the dependence of progress on the development
of scientific research; on the other hand, **[it [perceives
science]{.mark} as something that [carries]{.mark} potential
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The digital revolution contributed to
the replacement of vertical models of dialogue between science
[and]{.mark} society with horizontal models \[43\]. An important subject
of the dialogue between society and science is the diversity of
scientific knowledge in the information environment. The transition of
scientific knowledge into knowledge for all is ensured by the
popularization of science, which gives knowledge a form accessible to
the general public.

**[The massive dissemination of fake science news can be [seen as a
crisis of the political system]{.mark} and science journalism and as a
new propaganda tool, where fake scientific information is deliberately
disseminated on social networks in a viral manner with the aim of
quickly impacting the audience.]{.underline}** There are many motives
for creating fake science news, the most obvious being financial gain
and ideological beliefs.

[Preventing the deliberate creation of false information is very
difficult, and, in democratic societies that operate on the principles
of free speech and freedom of expression, it is even more difficult.
Thus, instead of looking for ways to prevent the creation of
misinformation, the]{.underline} **[[primary focus should be]{.mark} on
[limiting]{.mark} the [spread of fake news]{.mark} [and
minimizing]{.mark} the [damage]{.mark} it can cause]{.underline}**.

===5 main reasons (misallocating resources, misinforming supporters,
alienating partners, delegitimizing evidence, & other one is
direct\-\--an action intended to enhance biod has a direct, negative
impact on a wild population) why disinformation/misinformation (same
effect so it's the same here) is bad for biodiversity & conservation
(problem of "misplaced conservation")

Recent social trends have seen rising [polarization]{.mark} in political
affiliations [and]{.mark} on key issues (Bail et al. 2018), along with
the amplification of misinterpreted or [false information]{.mark} in
public discourse (Lazer et al. 2018). These two trends may [have
[negative effects on]{.underline}]{.mark} [many aspects of [health,
politics, science, and]{.mark} the [conservation of
biod]{.mark}iversity.]{.underline} For example, as early as the 1940s,
and for decades after, the spread of misinformation overwhelmed
scientific evidence suggesting a link between tobacco smoking and cancer
(Proctor 2012). Today, similar misinformation regarding the efficacy of
vaccinations (Lazer et al. 2018) or responses to the public health
orders (e.g., the use of masks to reduce the spread of COVID-19) foments
polarization and threatens public health (Paes-Sousa et al. 2020). The
mere suggestion of human-caused climate change has become polarizing,
impeding actions that could minimize harm to human health, livelihoods,
and biodiversity (Biddle and Leuschner 2015). Polarization threatens
cooperative approaches to problem solving and decision-making (Barber
and McCarty 2015; Maher et al. 2018), while misinterpreted or false
information distracts the public and decision-makers from acting upon
pressing needs and may waste resources in doing so (Oreskes and Conway
2011; Barnes et al. 2018). [The conservation of biodiversity is a
globally significant challenge, and inherently **requires cooperation
and evidence to be successful**. However, success in conservation can be
influenced by actions that **undermine cooperation and
evidence**---i.e., **polarization and misinformation**.]{.underline} To
better understand how polarization and misinformation affects
biodiversity, we define the term [**"misplaced conservation"**, which
occurs when actions increase the scientific, financial, political, or
social resources required to achieve a positive outcome for biodiversity
in the present or future.]{.underline} [Misplaced conservation is
distinct from other human activities that are also direct threats to
biodiversity, such as habitat loss or overexploitation.]{.underline} The
concept of misplaced conservation focuses on activities where
conservation [resources are expended on an improper, unsuitable, or
unworthy activity and the intended outcome of such activity was: (i) to
maintain or restore biodiversity, but this outcome is impeded by lack of
cooperation and evidence and (ii) to intentionally impede the use of
cooperation and evidence in the context of doing
conservation.]{.underline} For these reasons, misplaced conservation
arises from the combined underlying influences of polarization and
misinformation on conservation activities. By articulating the concept
of misplaced conservation (Fig. 1), we hope to provide a framework to
help overcome barriers to more effective conservation actions. At its
most benign, misplaced conservation may arise from genuine motivations
to conserve biodiversity. These motivations may quickly give rise to
incremental actions that appear as "baby steps" or "raising awareness".
Too often, the success of these actions is not supported with evidence
of their positive effect on biodiversity and may instead be distracting
or otherwise placating people into a false sense of success (Hagmann et
al. 2019). For example, "nudging" is a concept that alters the
architecture of choice or the context in which choices are made to
provide options that have smaller benefits, with lower costs, with
quicker pay offs (Thaler and Sunstein 2009). While nudging has proven
effective in many circumstances (Sunstein 2017), it can also lead to
complacency that undermines support for more impactful policies and
decision-making. Using an experimental approach, Hagmann et al. (2019)
found that people overestimated the effectiveness of small gains in
environmental policy, when a more costly but more effective alternative
was presented. Similarly, simply "raising awareness" does not always
lead to positive changes for conservation. In a behavioral experiment,
Dunn et al. (2020) found that after watching a documentary about marine
conservation, people increased their subject matter knowledge, but they
did not change their behaviour with respect to ocean pollutants. While
many impactful environmental movements began with smaller, incremental
successes, nudges, and awareness campaigns, it should not be assumed
that these are effective tools for conservation. The effectiveness of
such interventions needs to be evaluated against the potential costs
incurred by the fomentation of complacency. Misplaced conservation also
occurs when actions are intended to impede successful conservation. This
malicious intent could, for example, involve attacking the credibility
of an opposing scientist when competing lines of evidence are part of a
conflict between stakeholders (Horton et al. 2016; Harvey et al. 2018;
Loss and Marra 2018). For example, Hmielowski et al. (2014) found that
when the mainstream media work to deliberately decrease trust in
scientists, it increases uncertainty that global warming is happening.
Giving equal weight to dissenting views, often a hallmark of journalism,
without consideration of expertise may further exacerbate the
credibility of science (Brown and Havstad 2017) and lead to policies
that are inconsistent with the best available evidence to solve problems
(Anderegg et al. 2010). \[fig. 1 omitted\] Whether people are motivated
by truly benign outcomes and happen to be misguided or ignorant in their
execution of conservation actions or they are motivated to be
deliberately malevolent or negligent, we consider all of these intents
to be part of misplaced conservation. The outcomes, rather than
intentions, help determine misplaced conservation. Here, we describe
some of the key actions that create misplaced conservation, supported by
case studies to demonstrate this concept. We begin by describing five
nonexclusive actions and then discuss solutions to better understand and
resolve it---a critical step towards biodiversity conservation in an era
of polarization and lies. Broadly speaking, there are direct (1) and
indirect (4) pathways through which the actions of people lead to
misplaced conservation (Fig. 1). Direct misplaced conservation has a
proximate, negative impact on a wildlife population or biodiversity. In
contrast, indirect, misplaced conservation impedes the ability of the
public, conservation practitioners, stakeholders, or scientists to do
conservation. The indirect impacts of misplaced conservation arise from
(i) misallocating of resources, (ii) misinforming supporters, (iii)
alienating partners, and (iv) delegitimizing evidence. These actions are
not mutually exclusive and can combine to influence conservation
outcomes (Table 1). For example, this misallocating resources can lead
to a direct loss of biodiversity (Bottrill et al. 2008; Gilbert et al.
2020) or the misuse of evidence can entrench alienization of potential
partners (Hodgson et al. 2019). Misplaced conservation can arise when an
action intended to enhance biodiversity has a direct and negative impact
on a wild population, species, or ecological community (Table 1). For
example, domestic sheep (Ovis aries) were removed from a private ranch
ahead of the area's forthcoming designation as Patagonia National Park,
Chile (Wittmer et al. 2013). A primary motivation to create this
protected area was to conserve populations of huemul deer (Hippocamelus
bisulcus). However, by removing an important prey item (i.e., sheep) for
local carnivores (Vulpes spp. and Puma concolor), predation rates on
native deer species increased. The well-intentioned action of creating a
more "pristine" environment to benefit huemel deer accelerated their
decline. In another case of direct harm, members of the public planted a
species of milkweed to help provide habitat for monarch butterflies
(Wade 2015). However, some people used a milkweed species that is not
native to the temperate species range of monarch butterflies. As a
result, monarchs interrupted their migration and were exposed to higher
rates of egg parasites. Exposure to this non-native milkweed created a
direct threat to monarchs (Satterfield et al. 2015). Lastly, kokanee
salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) stocks in Okanagan Lake, British Columbia,
were declining through the 1950s (Shepherd 1999). The planned
introduction of the exotic mysid shrimp (Mysis relicta) in 1966 was
intended to provide productive forage for the native salmon with the
intention of bolstering the fishery. However, shrimp were able to escape
predation from salmon through diel migration through the water column
and then compete with juvenile kokanee for plankton. As a result, the
introduction of mysid shrimp reduced forage for juvenile salmon,
reducing recruitment, and directly hastening the decline of the salmon
fishery. Consequently, there have been calls for the application of
additional, costly control measures to lower mysid numbers (Shepherd
1999). **[The [well-intentioned but misplaced]{.mark} effort to conserve
biodiversity may [exacerbate declines]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Efforts to
bolster evidence through pilot studies and adaptive management and to
improve the uptake of evidence in policy through cooperative approaches
in decision-making are needed to minimize the prevalence of direct
misplaced conservation. It is a common experience for people working in
conservation to operate with under-supported resources. These resources
include funding, time, volunteer effort, media attention, or social or
political capital. [[Misplaced conservation occurs when]{.mark} such
**[fixed]{.mark} and limited [resources]{.mark} are [misallocated
to]{.mark} issues that have [minimal gains for
biod]{.mark}iversity**]{.underline} (Table 1). This [**misallocation of
resources** makes it more difficult to act upon [higher priority
action]{.mark} because fewer resources are then available.]{.underline}
\[table 1 omitted\] Misallocating resources has often occurred when
conservation agencies decide which species to prioritize for recovery or
enhanced management. Species recovery efforts are often targeted at a
subset of species under threat---this subset may have a higher "profile"
(i.e., is more charismatic) [and]{.mark} a [lower threat profile]{.mark}
than other [species]{.mark}. [Consequently, species with a lower public
profile are [underresourced]{.mark}]{.underline} (Donaldson et al.
2016). In some cases, habitat protection for less-charismatic species
can be far more cost-effective approach to restoring biodiversity than
efforts focused exclusively on high-profile species (Neeson et al.
2018). Similarly, [the rise of individually focused conservation
outcomes, or "compassionate conservation" (Ramp and Bekoff 2015) pulls
resources away from more proximate causes of species or population
decline to serve the welfare outcomes of individual animals, usually
from a limited subset of large charismatic species]{.underline} (Hayward
et al. 2019; Oommen et al. 2019). While animal welfare is embodied in
many aspects of wildlife management and research, it is often unstated
how attention given to the fate of individuals elevates the conservation
of a species, population, or community. For example, many people were
upset when "Cecil" the lion was killed by a hunter in 2015, yet policy
reforms to support lion conservation have moved little since that time
(Carpenter and Konisky 2019). Still, the legacy of Cecil's death remains
a rallying cry for some conservation groups (Darimont et al. 2020).
Efforts to address the negative impacts of habitat loss, invasive
species, or human--wildlife conflict through compassionate conservation
approaches would make unavailable some of the most cost effective and
successful tools developed to preserve and restore biodiversity (Callen
et al. 2020). To minimize the misallocation of resources, there either
needs to be better use of existing allocations, or more resources, and
preferably both (Bonebrake et al. 2019). To improve use of existing
allocations, conservationists have put forward prioritization schemes to
quantify tradeoffs in decision-making (Martin et al. 2018). In some
cases, such priority allocation could lead to the loss of some
components of biodiversity, but preserve a larger, more valued component
(Gilbert et al. 2020). This so-called "conservation triage" has been
hotly contested (Bottrill et al. 2008), but until resources are
enhanced, there will likely remain a need to prioritize allocations in a
world of finite resources. While we argue there is no "most correct"
conservation action that inherently deserves priority resource
allocation, a more transparent, evidence-based and cooperative
decision-making process should at least reveal tradeoffs in resource
use. Questions of whose priority matters the most are critical to
resolving allocation in a just and equitable manner. As such, the
underlying human dimensions of conservation governance are central to
mobilizing cooperative approaches to evidence-based decision-making
(Decker et al. 2016). **[Misplaced conservation [outcomes]{.mark} can
a[rise when]{.mark} the [public]{.mark} is [misinformed about]{.mark}
which threats are most pressing, which species are a [priority]{.mark}
for action, [and]{.mark} (or) which actions are most beneficial for
biodiversity]{.underline}** (Table 1). A misinformed public also diverts
resources away from actions that benefit conservation. For example, in
the 2010s, a series of amateur-made online petitions to ban shark
finning in Florida (USA) attracted tens of thousands of signatures.
However, shark finning was banned in Florida in 1994, such that these
petitions cannot possibly achieve their stated goal. These "finning"
campaigns also contribute to the misunderstanding of threats facing
sharks by incorrectly suggesting that the shark fin trade is the only
threat these animals face (Shiffman and Hueter 2017). [In contrast,
government-sponsored (e.g., National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), a Federal agency that houses the National Marine
Fisheries Service agency (NMFS)) **petitions that would lead to tangible
policy directions receive little attention**.]{.underline} For example,
three recent and evidenced-based proposals aimed to improve the
sustainability of fisheries: an 2016 NMFS proposal to modify
recreational angling regulations for threatened dusky sharks (81 FR
71672), a 2017proposal to alter the US-Atlantic coast shark fishing
season (82 FR 55512), and a 2017 proposal to require tuna fishing
vessels to release threatened sharks that they capture (82 FR 56177).
None of these petitions received substantial public support or
commentary (only 87, 13, and 1 comment(s) were posted, respectively).
Similar to the case of using non-native milkweed to help monarch
butterflies, recent awareness of pollinator conservation has focused
largely on campaigns to "save the bees". However, confusion over how to
best do this has been impeded by the conflation of native pollinators
and managed, non-native bees (Dicks 2013). Managed bees contribute to
the decline of native biodiversity via pathogen spillover and
competition for floral nectar (Colla and MacIvor 2017). Broadscale
policies to conserve pollinators, such as the US-based Pollinator
Partnership Action Plan, focus on land uses and pesticide bans that will
benefit non-native honey bees at the expense of native bumblebee species
(Nicholls et al. 2020). While wild honey bee conservation is a concern
within its native range (Requier et al. 2019), misinformed support for
such "insect livestock" and feral, non-native species across North
America threatens native pollinators which are truly at risk of
extinction (Dicks 2013). Ocean plastics have emerged as a central issue
in marine conservation. For example, "straw shaming"---even at the cost
of infringing on the needs of people experiencing physical
disabilities--- is one extreme outcome of the plastic pollution response
(Krueger 2019). However, technological solutions to remove ocean garbage
(i.e., through surface skimming) may not target the areas of the ocean
where most pollution occurs (i.e., at depth) (Stafford and Jones 2019).
Like the nudging of decarbonization policy (Hagmann et al. 2019),
contemporary approaches to plastic pollution may have created a
"convenient truth to distract environmental policy from more serious and
urgent threats" (Stafford and Jones 2019). [Overcoming these distracting
discourses in conservation will not only require effective science but
also effective communication of knowledge to support behavioral
changes.]{.underline} As with the other dimensions of misplaced
conservation, [supporters become misinformed when evidence is not
communicated clearly or used appropriately]{.underline}. Such
misinformed support can be the outcome of conservation leadership
failing to "do their homework" for how to best focus the efforts of
people invested in positive outcomes for biodiversity. Efforts to better
connect conservation biology and conservation social science (including
communication science) are critical to channeling clear and accurate
information to supporters (Kareiva and Marvier 2012; Bennett et al.
2017). **[Misplaced conservation can occur [when]{.mark} the partners
([groups]{.mark} or individuals) become [alienate]{.mark}d [from a
shared vision]{.mark} of success that was [caused by]{.mark}, or
results, in greater [polarization]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Alienation
occurs when short-term gains are elevated over long-term benefits and
when individual gains are elevated over collective benefits, giving rise
to conservation social dilemmas (Cumming 2018) or conservation conflict
(Redpath et al. 2013). While alienation may result from different value
systems held by conservation partners and the perceptions of inequity
(i.e., superiority) in those value systems relative to others (Saunders
et al. 2006; Manfredo et al. 2017), the outcome is disrupted
partnerships. For example, hunting, animal welfare, and conservation
organizations may not share the same ethical, instrumental, or
utilitarian values towards wildlife, yet all of these groups advocate
for better conservation outcomes for wildlife (Butler et al. 2003;
Treves 2009; Dickman et al. 2019). [When these groups are pitted against
one another over a subset of values (e.g., consumptive use of wildlife;
evidence vs. anecdote; science vs. emotion), [it generates conflict and
weakens]{.mark} their collective [ability]{.mark} to affect change on
commonly shared values (e.g., the persistence of wildlife populations)
(Redpath et al. 2017). Given the importance of partnerships in achieving
conservation success (McNeely 1995; Cooke et al. 2020), efforts that
disrupt partnerships can have dire and long-lasting
consequences.]{.underline} One common way alienation manifests is
through geopolitical structures that are decoupled from diverse value
systems and worldviews. As in many countries, people in rural Sweden had
a more favorable view of lethal approaches to human--wildlife conflict
than people in urban areas (Gangaas et al. 2013). Urban populations can
influence policy on human--wildlife conflict policy without facing the
proximate consequences of loss of safety, interruption of livelihood, or
damage to property (Ericsson and Heberlein 2003). Rural residents may
therefore act outside of regulations (Gangaas et al. 2013) unless given
more appropriate tools and resources to resolve conflict with wildlife
(König et al. 2020). Similarly, Indigenous perspectives in conservation
often are alienated by colonial governments. Recently, The Tahltan
Nation in British Columbia offered bounties for grizzly bear and wolf
harvest following a province-wide ban on grizzly bear hunting---which
the Tahltan had vocally opposed (Simmons 2020). The persistence of
stakeholder conflict, unregulated actions, and centralized or colonial
decision-making makes it more difficult to conserve biodiversity for
rural, urban, and Indigenous people. The emergence of alienated partners
speaks clearly to the role of cooperation as an antidote to
polarization. In some cases, evidence can help support or bring together
groups in a cooperative manner and reduce polarization (Baynham-Herd et
al. 2020; Williams et al. 2020). However, science can also become
"weaponized" by all sides in public debate, such that more information
will not always generate better decisions (Peery et al. 2019). Instead
of conflating conservation with a "data gap" per se, efforts to improve
processes that lead to better decisions (i.e., in a manner the improves
stakeholder or public support) may be needed to overcome the alienation
of partners and increase the success of conservation actions.
**[Misplaced conservation can arise \[[or]{.mark}\] [when]{.mark} the
products (i.e., facts) and generators (i.e., scientists) of
[evidence]{.mark} are [delegitimized]{.mark} in the political or
decision-making realm]{.underline}** (Table 1). Here, we refer to
evidence in the context of biological and social "western science", and
recognize that there are other systems that create, hold, and share
knowledge (e.g., Indigenous knowledge) that make important contributions
towards conservation (Garnett et al. 2018) [and]{.mark} also face
delegitimization. Delegitimization may arise when scientists
representing different world views, or interpretations of data, come
into debate over a policy. [The perception of [scientific uncertainty
is]{.mark} then [exploited]{.mark} to undermine conservation
outcomes.]{.underline} When decision-makers or the public perceive a
lack of scientific consensus, it undermines the value of evidence and
confidence in evidence-based decision-making (Lewandowsky et al. 2013).
For example, special interest groups may inflate perceptions of
uncertainty, via doubt mongering, in a practice that has been seen in
polar bear conservation (Harvey et al. 2018), the impact of free ranging
cats on biodiversity (Loss and Marra 2018), and responses to climate
change (Oreskes and Conway 2011). In some cases, delegitimization may
arise from competing interests in the uptake of certain types of
information, rather than a lack of information per se. "Whose science
matters" becomes central to these debates and evidence may reinforce,
rather than neutralize, polarization among groups (Hodgson et al. 2019).
Such debates have been documented in raptor conservation (Hodgson et al.
2019), deer management (Freddy et al. 2004), bear hunting (Maji´c et al.
2011), and climate change (Hayhoe 2018). Peery et al. (2019) described
the challenge of agenda-driven science in conservation: "because
conservation conflicts in an increasingly polarized world might tempt
some to engage in agenda-driven science to win a conflict." Finally,
scientists may delegitimize their own contributions to positive
conservation outcomes. Unlike fundamental scientific disciplines,
conservation sciences actively encourage the blending of
curiosity-driven, basic research with mission-oriented applied research
and advocacy (Horton et al. 2016; Smol 2018). Conservation scientists
often engage in public discourse and play an important role in
disseminating facts to the public, stakeholders, and decision-makers
(Chan 2008; Smol 2018). However, [conservation scientists risk depleting
the credibility of the research community in general if values and facts
are conflated]{.underline} (Horton et al. 2016; Redpath et al. 2017).
Indeed, as Baynham-Herd et al. (2020) showed, [trustworthiness of
intervenors is seen as a key predictor of cooperation in conservation
with integrity ranking as a key dimension of how trust is built. For
this reason, transparency in the facts (i.e., scientific consensus) vs.
the expressed values of the scientist require clear
articulation.]{.underline} As Chan (2008) argued, conservation
scientists must clearly communicate where the facts stop and where their
own values begin, or they risk abusing goodwill and trust towards
science and its practitioners. To avoid or mitigate misplaced
conservation efforts, we recommend that more effort be made to adopt an
intentional, transparent process of decision-making that accounts for
the gains and losses to both cooperation and biodiversity (Saunders et
al. 2006). While this effort may at first appear to be conservation
dictum, we underscore that cooperation has too often taken a back seat
to short-term gains in biodiversity. Finding pathways cooperation, in
spite of knowledge gaps and differences in attitudes or beliefs, remains
an essential and yet understudied tool in formal conservation education
and training (Cinner 2018). Rather than try to change or undermine the
values of potential partners, it is usually more effective to find
alignment with the existing values of conservation partners (Decker et
al. 2016; Manfredo et al. 2017; Hayhoe 2018). Seeing conservation
efforts as a push towards better cooperation and use of evidence is one
way to suppress the negative effects of polarization and misinformation.
Scientists and managers should invest in (and be supported to do so)
efforts to monitor the outcomes of conservation action, then interpret,
share, and respond adaptively to evidence as it accrues. Such an
"adaptive management" approach is often discussed in conservation but
not clearly executed (Keith et al. 2011). For example, recent efforts to
ban (British Columbia, Canada in 2017) or restore (in Wyoming, USA)
grizzly bear hunting have focused on ethics and individual welfare;
however, there has been little or no advocacy by conservation groups to
create processes that quantify the impacts of these policy changes on
bear populations and the people who must co-exist with them. Adaptive
management as a means of understanding and solving conservation problems
is vulnerable to many of the same challenges faced in misplaced
conservation writ large, with self interest, conflicts, and deliberate
overconfidence in data serving to undermine management goals (Walters
1997). Reducing uncertainty is a central goal of evidence-based
decision-making, yet progress in science is often nonlinear and
unpredictable. Debate and paradigm shifts are a normal and important
part of the scientific process (Kuhn 2012). Conservation science is no
different, with some debates unresolved after decades of research (Young
et al. 2010). As such, we do not suggest that conservation scientists
should abandon productive and civil debates about science generally or
conservation specifically, but we hope that such debates will focus on
critical and transparent analysis of data, analyses, techniques, and
interpretations, rather than a critique of scientists or the inferred
motivations or values of potential conservation partners. Conservation
actions often are motivated by perceptions of scarcity and imbue a sense
of urgency--- the time to act is "now". However, **[the [risks]{.mark}
that [come from]{.mark} passionate, but [misinformed]{.mark},
[people]{.mark} advocating for preferred policy outcomes that misalign
with evidence can be high]{.underline}**. Cooperation, as antidote to
extinction, needs to transcend the roles played by people concerned with
biodiversity, of which scientists are but a limited sector. Many groups
(e.g., public, experts, scientists, governments, and conservation
organizations) are responsible for promoting the importance of
biodiversity and acting to averting loss. For this reason, it is not
necessary for every concerned member of the public to know every
technical detail and nuance of complex environmental problems, nor the
policies that can help address them. Nonexperts can help by joining, or
working to amplify the message of, expertled and evidence-based
conservation campaigns. Nonexperts can also volunteer their time or help
raise funds for expert-driven campaigns, or they can write to
decision-makers expressing support for (or opposition to) policies as
recommended by experts. Ultimately, people should consider that without
specific knowledge, training, or experience, that there are real risks
to people and biodiversity if ineffective solutions are promoted to
resolve complex problems. \[table 2 omitted\] In addition to cooperation
across levels of "expertise", efforts to promote cooperation across
backgrounds and identities has demonstrated positive outcomes for
science. Conservation actions stemming from diverse and inclusive
processes that include a variety of views and experiences should produce
the best outcomes. For example, greater gender diversity on research
teams leads to more productive scientific outcomes, in addition to the
benefits of creating more equitable workspaces (Nielsen et al. 2017).
Likewise, integrating local and macro-scale institutions is a critical
step towards recognizing the diversity of power, scope, and governance
structures that affect biodiversity (Berkes 2007; Popp et al. 2019).
Including local peoples in decision-making increases their agency over
resources and should increase acceptance of any changes to their daily
lives that come from conservation actions. An important vehicle for
cooperation is open, transparent, and respectful communication with all
relevant partners (Lundquist and Granek 2005). Stakeholders and rights
holders who believe that regulations were developed in a reasonable,
fair manner that incorporates collective priorities are more likely to
follow resulting regulations and laws (Kennedy 2010; Dressel et al.
2020). Likewise, when stakeholders feel like they and their concerns are
being ignored, they are more likely to ignore the resulting regulations
(Suman et al. 1999; Freddy et al. 2004). Shiffman (2020) documented how
strategically communicating key scientific facts and science-based
policy solutions resulted in passing new environmental regulations while
minimizing inter-stakeholder conflicts. Social media has transformed how
people communicate with one another, a transformation that has important
implications for both environmental advocacy and for conservation
scientists who wish to engage in public outreach (Parsons et al. 2014;
Lamb et al. 2018; Smol 2018). This transformation may not always result
in positive gains for biodiversity (i.e., via the spread of
misinformation; Vosoughi et al. (2018)); nonetheless, social media is a
powerful form of intervention and feedback. When used well, social media
also has the potential to infuse public discourse with expert-supported
approaches to conservation and pushback on misinformation (Thaler and
Shiffman 2015; Shiffman 2020). In addition, scientists can now hear the
concerns people are expressing on social media about
biodiversity-related policies and this, in turn, can help design more
cooperative approaches to conservation and nuanced communication
strategies. This insight needs to be contextualized of course, as the
media channels available to a scientist are constructed through the same
biased algorithms as the information leading from the scientist to the
public. As much as there are positive steps people can take to reduce
misplaced conservation, acting poorly can make a bad situation worse.
There is a need for conservation scientists to acknowledge that people
trying to help is not the same as helping, and good intentions do not
excuse easily foreseen or managed harm. Case studies of misplaced
conservation often highlight people who wanted to help but may have not
foreseen the myriad outcomes of their actions. However, conservation
decisions affect the existence of species, peoples' livelihoods, or the
intactness of cultures---the onus on better decision-making leaves
little room for error (Foote and Wenzel 2009). Misplaced conservation
asks scientists and stakeholders to acknowledge that outcomes---rather
than intentions---are the arbitrator of conservation success. Society
has enshrined into law the concept of negligence to help guide
responsible behaviour when the outcomes were reasonably anticipated. For
example, driving while intoxicated is against the law in many places
because it is a known and well-established risk to public safety---the
intentions of the driver (e.g., to get home) are not at issue. There
often are no explicit laws to protect against misplaced conservation
(i.e., excluding environmental regulations) and this is unlikely to
occur. However, there is a need to better hold people involved in making
conservation decisions accountable for their role in promoting
polarization and misinformation. The benefits of cooperative and
evidence-based approaches to conservation are well described and are
generally regarded as essential for achieving conservation gains (Keith
et al. 2011). These approaches build policy with evidence and integrate
wholistic dimensions of conservation practice---including the roles of
governance, politics, social justice, and fundamental ecology. Yet, the
adoption of these concepts is far from universal practice. There is a
need to better understand and then address the practices that run
counter to the body of knowledge that has described pathways to
effective conservation practice (Table 2). Society is witnessing one of
the largest and most rapid mobilizations of scientific focus and public
policy in history in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. [Along with the
urgency and scope of this crisis, lessons are quickly emerging about the
critical role of scientific integrity and accountability and the need
for accurate communication between science, policy, and the
public]{.underline} (Piller 2020). Conservation science will benefit
from these lessons as society continues to cope with accelerating global
extinctions. Articulating the mechanisms of, and solutions, to misplaced
conservation will help ensure that efforts to restore and protect
biodiversity are successful.

**[Catastrophic consequences for civilization]{.underline}**. The
consequences of this rapid pruning of the evolutionary tree of life
extend beyond the obvious. [There could be surprising effects of
biodiversity loss that scientists are unable to fully anticipate in
advance]{.underline}. For example, prior research has shown that
[[localized ecosystems]{.mark} can [undergo abrupt and irreversible
shifts]{.mark} when they [reach]{.mark} a [tipping
point]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to a 2012 paper published in
Nature, there are reasons for thinking that we may be approaching a
tipping point of this sort in the global ecosystem, beyond which the
consequences could be catastrophic for civilization. As the authors
write, [a planetary-scale transition could precipitate "substantial
losses of ecosystem services [required to sustain]{.mark} the [human
population]{.mark}]{.underline}." An ecosystem service is any ecological
process that benefits humanity, **[such as food production and crop
pollination]{.underline}**. [If the global ecosystem were to cross a
tipping point and substantial ecosystem services were lost, the results
could be "**widespread social unrest, economic instability, and loss of
human life**.]{.underline}" According to Missouri Botanical Garden
ecologist Adam Smith, one of the paper's co-authors, **[this could
[occur]{.mark} in a matter of decades]{.underline}**---**[[far more
quickly than]{.mark} most of the expected consequences of [climate
change, yet equally destructive]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Biodiversity
loss is a "threat multiplier"]{.underline}** that, [by pushing societies
to the brink of collapse, will [exacerbate existing conflicts and
introduce]{.mark} entirely [new struggles]{.mark} between state and
non-state actors]{.underline}. Indeed, **[it could even fuel the rise of
terrorism]{.underline}**. (After all, climate change has been linked to
the emergence of ISIS in Syria, and multiple high-ranking US officials,
such as former US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and CIA director John
Brennan, have affirmed that climate change and terrorism are connected.)
The reality is that **[we are entering the sixth mass
extinction]{.underline}** in the 3.8-billion-year history of life on
Earth, and [the impact of this event could be felt by civilization "in
as little as three human lifetimes,"]{.underline} as the aforementioned
2012 Nature paper notes. Furthermore, the **[widespread decline of
biological populations could plausibly initiate a dramatic
transformation of the global ecosystem on an even faster timescale:
perhaps a single human lifetime]{.underline}**. The unavoidable
conclusion is that **[biodiversity loss [constitutes an existential
threat]{.mark} in its own right]{.underline}**. As such, [it ought to be
considered [alongside]{.mark} climate change and [nuclear
weapons]{.mark} as one of the most significant contemporary risks to
human prosperity and survival.]{.underline}

===tbh this card is kind of similar to Gerbina but is better lol; not
specific to undermining trust though this is about just wrong
information makes people do the wrong things

The overall success of the scientific method also means that when
someone wants to make claims that go against established scientific
knowledge and are not grounded in the scientific method, they must seek
to undermine the trustworthiness of the scientific method or scientists
per se. Thus, paradoxically, scientific language is often adopted at the
same time as scientific activities themselves are being questioned. An
extreme and particularly harmful form of anti-scientific activity
appears in the form of conspiracy theories with notable examples in the
three areas chosen for analysis in this discussion paper: climate
change, vaccines, and pandemics.3

**[Science [disinformation]{.mark} is one of the major
[challenges]{.mark} of our times, with consequences for [society]{.mark}
at large [and]{.mark} for ([trust in]{.mark})
[science]{.mark}.]{.underline}**4, 5 This paper sheds light on the
characteristics and mechanisms of science disinformation and discusses
what scientists, science communicators and policymakers can do about it.

While science disinformation and misinformation is common in many
different areas, we have chosen to focus on three that strike us as
particularly important: climate change, vaccine safety and pandemics.

Climate change in the form of global warming resulting from human
activities was first predicted more than a century ago. [Continuous
monitoring of various physical and chemical parameters shows that the
process of [warming]{.mark} has accelerated during recent decades. Signs
of global warming include melting glaciers, thawing permafrost, and
rising sea levels.]{.underline} [These changes are caused by growing
concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Findings in many
areas of research are almost unanimously interpreted to mean that the
large number of humans and their activities have prominent roles in
these developments.]{.underline}6

[Major concerns are now if the increase in carbon dioxide levels and
temperatures mean that **[efforts]{.mark} to break the rising curves
[will come too late]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [Models predict rising sea
levels and **[flooding]{.mark} of large coastal area**s, thereby
**reducing areas for human [settlements]{.mark} and [food]{.mark}
production**. This is predicted to **[displace]{.mark} hundreds of
millions of [people]{.mark}**, resulting in an **increased population
density and [raising]{.mark} the potential for [violent
conflicts]{.mark}**. Together, these processes will **[extinguish
habitats for]{.mark} many [species]{.mark} of organisms and [exacerbate
the ongoing mass extinction]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Despite overwhelming scientific evidence,]{.underline} [politically
motivated refusal to accept anthropogenic global warming (increasing
temperatures due to human influence) has been intense and has used both
'cherry-picking' and conspiracy theories in order to counter widely
accepted scientific evidence]{.underline}. This resistance has received
strong financial support from business interests, [further amplified by
certain sections of the media]{.underline}. **[If the facts of climate
change and its causes are countered with [false claims]{.mark} about
cause-and-consequence relationships, this will [delay actions to reduce
global warming]{.mark}, potentially [with disastrous
consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[Vaccines]{.mark} are considered one of the most [important]{.mark}
inventions ever for the benefit of humankind.]{.underline}** The World
Health Organization has estimated that vaccines save 2-3 millions of
lives every year, especially children, and prevent unimaginable
suffering.7 [High immunity at the population level arising from
vaccinations leads to reduced transmission of an infectious disease and
may even eliminate it completely. Those who have been vaccinated will
serve as a protective barrier by not transmitting the disease to those
who have not been vaccinated (so called 'herd immunity')]{.underline}.

[Nevertheless, opposition towards vaccination has existed since
vaccination programmes were introduced. The reasons for this resistance
have varied over time and have at times been based on valid doubts as to
the vaccine's efficacy. However, some vaccines have been used for
decades and all vaccines are consistently monitored to ensure a high
ratio of benefits over risks. In addition, high standards for the
approval of new vaccines have been implemented worldwide. Nevertheless,
public resistance to vaccines prevails in some pockets of our societies,
sometimes keeping vaccination uptake below the threshold required for
herd immunity.]{.underline}

[**[False information]{.mark}, exaggerated/unjustified claims [about
side effects]{.mark}, [or]{.mark} conspiracy theories [regarding]{.mark}
underlying [objectives for]{.mark} global [vaccination]{.mark}
programmes may ultimately [lead t]{.mark}o an insufficient rate of
vaccination and therefore [inadequate levels of immunity at the
population level.]{.mark}** [Vaccine hesitancy can]{.mark} not only lead
to unnecessary disease outbursts, but also puts those at risk who have
not yet been vaccinated, especially infants, and those who cannot be
vaccinated, such as individuals with immune deficiencies.]{.underline}
**[Misinformation that increases vaccine hesitancy may cause more people
to suffer from an epidemic, more [people]{.mark} to show severe
symptoms, and more people to [die]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The origin and spread of the pandemic have been the subject of much
speculation, some of which has involved fanciful conspiracy theories
such as linking the pandemic to 5G mobile phone technology or suggesting
the virus was man made and introduced into the population on purpose. In
addition, there have been numerous cases of fraudulent marketing of
health care products, ranging from face masks to ventilators. Even
political leaders in several countries have promoted regimens that
completely lacked clinical or biological evidence. Those who complied
may have caused themselves unnecessary harm and/or felt unduly safe and
have displayed more risky behaviour, either by exposing themselves to
individuals infected with the virus or by ignoring their own symptoms
and thereby exposing others. [This 'infodemic' coined by the WHO may
have contributed to the spreading of the pandemic and may have
**increased the number of patients with severe symptoms requiring
intensive care, as well as the number of deaths.**]{.underline}

Generating disinformation can be incited by different motivations in
different actors and in numerous combinations. The most apparent
motivations are financial profit and ideological conviction. Both can at
times deviate from norms of rationality and moral standards when
individuals ignore or are unable to recognise harmful consequences for
others. In other instances, the aim of **[[disinformation]{.mark} is to
deliberately [cause]{.mark} [confusion, instability]{.mark}, or
[mistrust for political purposes]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[Deliberate construction of false information is very difficult to
prevent.]{.underline} When lies are generated wilfully, the responsible
individuals have already committed themselves to fraud. Likewise, it may
also be hard to convince those who knowingly disseminate existing
misinformation to change their behaviour. In open societies with strong
protective individual rights and freedom of expression, it is difficult
to stop disinformation at its roots, except by appealing to humanitarian
values and hoping that those who produce and spread disinformation will
consider with empathy the consequences for other people and then stop
themselves and change their behaviour. Instead of finding ways to
prevent disinformation from being generated in the first place,
**[[efforts]{.mark} will [have to]{.mark} focus on [limit]{.mark}ing the
spread of [disinformation]{.mark} [and minimis]{.mark}ing the
[damage]{.mark} it may cause]{.underline}**.

[Policymakers have at least four ways to prevent the spread of
misinformation]{.underline}: [They can regulate content directly,
provide someone with the authority for regulating content, redesign the
structures (platforms) in which content is generated and distributed, or
support the creation of instruments that can raise citizen awareness and
enable them to identify and prevent the dangers of
misinformation.]{.underline}30

One way forward is to ask public regulators of news media to intensify
their regulation of social media platforms and websites. Web services
are often sources of news and information while also financed by
advertising agencies. This leads to an obvious conflict of interest that
needs to be examined and constantly regulated.

However, search engines and social media platforms should not be viewed
as a threat to our democracy per se. We should act in an enlightened
manner to nurture and guide the rich value of diverse commercial sources
of digital information, as we do with newspapers and television
channels. We need to regulate them in a manner that allows us to access
the accurate information and exploit emerging information technologies,
e.g. automated factchecking and recommender systems.

Last but not least, **[[governments]{.mark} have the option of
[strengthen]{.mark}ing [incentives]{.mark} for [empower]{.mark}ing
[recipients]{.mark} of information [to identify]{.mark} and cope with
[mis- and disinformation]{.mark}, either themselves or [with the help of
machine learning systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**. (Digital) [media
literacy is crucial here for evaluating the content and context of
information and ultimately detecting its accuracy]{.underline}. Several
endogenous cues (content) and exogenous cues (context) can help **[test
the validity of information]{.underline}**.31 However, such cues to
disinformation and their uptake for regulation remain largely
underexplored.

**[[Urgent action on a global scale is necessary]{.mark} to mitigate
these processes.]{.underline}** However, many political leaders and
large proportions of populations still deny the factual observations,
the observed or inferred causes, and the predicted consequences. This
causes necessary decisions to be insufficient both in extent and time.
Thus scientists and science communicators are facing an immense
challenge to explain the chains of causal events, the ongoing global
warming and the predicted future consequences.

#### Extinction. 

**Kareiva 18**, Ph.D. in ecology and applied mathematics from Cornell
University, director of the Institute of the Environment and
Sustainability at UCLA, Pritzker Distinguished Professor in Environment
& Sustainability at UCLA, et al. (Peter, "Existential risk due to
ecosystem collapse: Nature strikes back," *Futures*, 102)

In summary, six of the nine proposed planetary boundaries (phosphorous,
nitrogen, biodiversity, land use, atmospheric aerosol loading, and
chemical pollution) are unlikely to be associated with existential
risks. They all correspond to a degraded environment, but in our
assessment do not represent existential risks. However, the three
remaining boundaries ([[climate]{.mark} [change]{.mark}, global
freshwater cycle, [and]{.mark} ocean
[acidification]{.mark}]{.underline}) do [[pose **existential
risks**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This is [because of]{.mark} intrinsic
**[positive feedback loops]{.mark}**]{.underline}, substantial lag times
between system change and experiencing the consequences of that change,
[[and]{.mark} the fact these different boundaries interact with one
another in ways that yield **[surprises]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
addition, [[climate]{.mark}, freshwater, [and]{.mark} ocean
[acidification are]{.mark} all [directly connected to]{.mark} the
provision of [**food** and **water**]{.mark}, and
[shortages]{.mark}]{.underline} of food and water can [[create
**conflict**]{.mark} and social unrest]{.underline}. Climate change has
a long history of disrupting civilizations and sometimes precipitating
the collapse of cultures or mass emigrations (McMichael, 2017). For
example, the 12th century drought in the North American Southwest is
held responsible for the collapse of the Anasazi pueblo culture. More
recently, the infamous potato famine of 1846--1849 and the large
migration of Irish to the U.S. can be traced to a combination of
factors, one of which was climate. Specifically, 1846 was an unusually
warm and moist year in Ireland, providing the climatic conditions
favorable to the fungus that caused the potato blight. As is so often
the case, poor government had a role as well---as the British government
forbade the import of grains from outside Britain (imports that could
have helped to redress the ravaged potato yields). [[Climate]{.mark}
[change]{.mark} intersects with freshwater resources because it is
expected to **[exacerbate]{.mark} drought** and]{.underline} [**[water
scarcity]{.mark}**,]{.underline} as well as flooding. Climate change can
even impair water quality because it is associated with heavy rains that
overwhelm sewage treatment facilities, or because it results in higher
concentrations of pollutants in groundwater as a result of enhanced
evaporation and reduced groundwater recharge. [Ample clean
[water]{.mark}]{.underline} is not a luxury---it [is [essential for
human survival]{.mark}.]{.underline} Consequently, cities, regions and
nations that lack clean freshwater are vulnerable to social disruption
and disease. Finally, ocean acidification is linked to climate change
because it is driven by CO2 emissions just as global warming is. With
close to 20% of the world's protein coming from oceans (FAO, 2016), the
potential for severe impacts due to acidification is obvious. Less
obvious, but perhaps more insidious, is the interaction between climate
change and the loss of oyster and coral reefs due to acidification.
Acidification is known to interfere with oyster reef building and coral
reefs. [Climate change also [increases **storm**]{.mark}
**[frequency]{.mark}** and severity. Coral reefs and oyster reefs
provide protection from storm surge because they reduce wave
energy]{.underline} (Spalding et al., 2014). [If these reefs are lost
due to acidification at the same time as storms become more severe and
sea level rises]{.underline}, **[[coastal communities]{.mark} will be
[exposed to]{.mark} unprecedented [storm
surge]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[and may be ravaged by recurrent
storms]{.underline}. A key feature of the risk associated with climate
change is that mean annual temperature and mean annual rainfall are not
the variables of interest. Rather it is extreme episodic events that
place nations and entire regions of the world at risk. These extreme
events are by definition "rare" (once every hundred years), and changes
in their likelihood are challenging to detect because of their rarity,
but are exactly the manifestations of climate change that we must get
better at anticipating (Diffenbaugh et al., 2017). [Society will have a
[hard time responding to]{.mark} **short**er [**intervals**
between]{.mark} rare **[extreme events]{.mark}**]{.underline} because in
the lifespan of an individual human, a person might experience as few as
two or three extreme events. How likely is it that you would notice a
change in the interval between events that are separated by decades,
especially given that the interval is not regular but varies
stochastically? A concrete example of this dilemma can be found in the
past and expected future changes in storm-related flooding of New York
City. The highly disruptive flooding of New York City associated with
Hurricane Sandy represented a flood height that occurred once every 500
years in the 18th century, and that occurs now once [every 25 years, but
is expected to occur once every 5 years by 2050]{.underline} (Garner et
al., 2017). This change in frequency of extreme floods has profound
implications for the measures New York City should take to protect its
infrastructure and its population, yet because of the stochastic nature
of such events, this shift in flood frequency is an elevated risk that
will go unnoticed by most people. 4. The combination of positive
feedback loops and societal inertia is fertile ground for global
environmental catastrophes [Humans are remarkably ingenious, and have
**adapted** to crises throughout their history]{.underline}. Our doom
has been repeatedly predicted, only to be averted by innovation (Ridley,
2011). [However, the many [stories of]{.mark} human ingenuity
[successfully addressing existential risks]{.mark}]{.underline} such as
global famine or extreme air pollution [[represent]{.mark} environmental
[challenges that are]{.mark} largely [linear, have immediate]{.mark}
[consequences, and operate without]{.mark} positive
[feedbacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, the fact that food is in
short supply does not increase the rate at which humans consume
food---thereby increasing the shortage. Similarly, massive air pollution
episodes such as the London fog of 1952 that killed 12,000 people did
not make future air pollution events more likely. In fact it was just
the opposite---the London fog sent such a clear message that Britain
quickly enacted pollution control measures (Stradling, 2016). Food
shortages, air pollution, water pollution, etc. send immediate signals
to society of harm, which then trigger a negative feedback of society
seeking to reduce the harm. In contrast, today's great environmental
crisis of climate change may cause some harm but there are generally
long time delays between rising CO2 concentrations and damage to humans.
The consequence of these delays are an absence of urgency; thus although
70% of Americans believe global warming is happening, only 40% think it
will harm them
(http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/).
Secondly, [unlike past environmental challenges, **the Earth's
[climate]{.mark} system [is rife with positive feedback]{.mark}
loop[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In particular, as CO2 increases and the
climate warms, that very [warming can cause more CO2]{.mark}
[release]{.mark} which further increases global warming, and then more
CO2, and so on]{.underline}. Table 2 summarizes the best documented
positive feedback loops for the Earth's climate system. These feedbacks
can be neatly categorized into carbon cycle, biogeochemical,
biogeophysical, cloud, ice-albedo, and water vapor feedbacks. As
important as it is to understand these feedbacks individually, it is
even more essential to study the interactive nature of these feedbacks.
Modeling studies show that when interactions among feedback loops are
included, uncertainty increases dramatically and there is a heightened
potential for perturbations to be magnified (e.g., Cox, Betts, Jones,
Spall, & Totterdell, 2000; Hajima, Tachiiri, Ito, & Kawamiya, 2014;
Knutti & Rugenstein, 2015; Rosenfeld, Sherwood, Wood, & Donner, 2014).
This produces a wide range of future scenarios. Positive feedbacks in
the carbon cycle involves the enhancement of future carbon contributions
to the atmosphere due to some initial increase in atmospheric CO2. This
happens because as CO2 accumulates, it reduces the efficiency in which
oceans and terrestrial ecosystems sequester carbon, which in return
feeds back to exacerbate climate change (Friedlingstein et al., 2001).
Warming can also increase the rate at which organic matter decays and
carbon is released into the atmosphere, thereby causing more warming
(Melillo et al., 2017). Increases in food shortages and lack of water is
also of major concern when biogeophysical feedback mechanisms perpetuate
drought conditions. The underlying mechanism here is that losses in
vegetation increases the surface albedo, which suppresses rainfall, and
thus enhances future vegetation loss and more suppression of
rainfall---thereby initiating or prolonging a drought (Chamey, Stone, &
Quirk, 1975). To top it off, overgrazing depletes the soil, leading to
augmented vegetation loss (Anderies, Janssen, & Walker, 2002). Climate
change often also increases the risk of forest fires, as a result of
higher temperatures and persistent drought conditions. [The expectation
is that forest [fires will become more]{.mark} [frequent]{.mark} and
severe with climate warming and drought]{.underline} (Scholze, Knorr,
Arnell, & Prentice, 2006), a trend for which we have already seen
evidence (Allen et al., 2010). Tragically, the increased severity and
risk of Southern California wildfires recently predicted by climate
scientists (Jin et al., 2015), was realized in December 2017, with the
largest fire in the history of California (the "Thomas fire" that burned
282,000 acres,
https://www.vox.com/2017/12/27/16822180/thomas-fire-california-largest-wildfire).
[This [catastrophic fire]{.mark} embodies the sorts of positive
feedbacks and interacting factors that [could **catch humanity
off-guard**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and produce a]{.mark} true
**[apocalyptic event]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Record-breaking rains
produced an extraordinary flush of new vegetation, that then dried out
as record heat waves and dry conditions took hold, coupled with stronger
than normal winds, and ignition. Of course the record-fire released CO2
into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to future warming. Out of all
types of feedbacks, water vapor and the ice-albedo feedbacks are the
most clearly understood mechanisms. Losses in reflective snow and ice
cover drive up surface temperatures, leading to even more melting of
snow and ice cover---this is known as the ice-albedo feedback (Curry,
Schramm, & Ebert, 1995). As snow and ice continue to melt at a more
rapid pace, millions of people may be displaced by flooding risks as a
consequence of sea level rise near coastal communities (Biermann & Boas,
2010; Myers, 2002; Nicholls et al., 2011). The water vapor feedback
operates when warmer atmospheric conditions strengthen the saturation
vapor pressure, which creates a warming effect given water vapor's
strong greenhouse gas properties (Manabe & Wetherald, 1967). Global
warming tends to increase cloud formation because warmer temperatures
lead to more evaporation of water into the atmosphere, and warmer
temperature also allows the atmosphere to hold more water. The key
question is whether this increase in clouds associated with global
warming will result in a positive feedback loop (more warming) or a
negative feedback loop (less warming). For decades, scientists have
sought to answer this question and understand the net role clouds play
in future climate projections (Schneider et al., 2017). Clouds are
complex because they both have a cooling (reflecting incoming solar
radiation) and warming (absorbing incoming solar radiation) effect
(Lashof, DeAngelo, Saleska, & Harte, 1997). The type of cloud, altitude,
and optical properties combine to determine how these countervailing
effects balance out. Although still under debate, it appears that in
most circumstances the cloud feedback is likely positive (Boucher et
al., 2013). For example, models and observations show that increasing
greenhouse gas concentrations reduces the low-level cloud fraction in
the Northeast Pacific at decadal time scales. This then has a positive
feedback effect and enhances climate warming since less solar radiation
is reflected by the atmosphere (Clement, Burgman, & Norris, 2009). [The
key lesson from the long list of potentially positive feedbacks and
their interactions is that]{.underline} [**[runaway climate
change]{.mark}**, and runaway perturbations have to be taken as a
serious possibility]{.underline}. Table 2 is just a snapshot of the type
of feedbacks that have been identified (see Supplementary material for a
more thorough explanation of positive feedback loops). However, [this
list is not exhaustive and the possibility of undiscovered positive
feedbacks [portends]{.mark} **even greater [existential
risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}s. The many environmental crises humankind
has previously averted (famine, ozone depletion, London fog, water
pollution, etc.) were averted because of political will based on solid
scientific understanding. We cannot count on complete scientific
understanding when it comes to positive feedback loops and climate
change.

#### Successful US Morale Information warfare ends the war in Ukraine

Daniel **Karr et al**., Daniel Karr is an intelligence consultant at
Recorded Future, an intelligence company, and a former intelligence
analyst at the US Department of Defense. Jacob Ware is the research
associate for counterterrorism at the Council on Foreign Relations and
an adjunct professor at Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh School
of Foreign Service. 4-14-20**22**, \"Hearts Not Minds: Morale and
Inspiration in Insurgency and Territorial Defense,\" Modern War
Institute at West Point ,
https://mwi.usma.edu/hearts-not-minds-morale-and-inspiration-in-insurgency-and-territorial-defense/

In war, morale always matters. The US military knows this better than
most[. [In]{.mark} July 1965, Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara [requested](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v03/d67) additional
deployments of US ground forces in [Vietnam]{.mark} to "destroying" the
morale of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Viet Cong,
including through the use of "informational actions."]{.underline}
[While [McNamara]{.mark} accurately predicted the impact of the
information environment on the morale of insurgents and
counterinsurgents alike, he [overlooked how]{.mark} these [deployments
would affect the morale of US]{.mark} soldiers in Vietnam and the US
public at home.]{.underline} Despite suffering hundreds of thousands of
casualties, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces held out,
capturing Saigon a decade after McNamara's request for additional
forces. The relative willpower of US forces compared to that of the Viet
Cong insurgents was one of [many
reasons](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2010/RAND_MG965.pdf) for
this outcome.

[Morale would similarly play a central role in US struggles in
Afghanistan and Iraq. Although patriotic sentiment was widespread after
the 9/11 attacks, US
morale [waned](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2015/06/29/iraq-afghanistan-and-the-u-s-militarys-morale-crisis/) over
time, beaten down by improvised explosive devices, sniper attacks, and
the knowledge that blood and sweat shed in conflicts in the Middle East
and south Asia were yielding few strategic results]{.underline}. As one
Taliban fighter is said to
have [declared](https://www.newsweek.com/10-years-afghan-war-how-taliban-go-68223),
"You have the watches. We have the time." Both insurgent and
counterinsurgent in Iraq and Afghanistan were well aware of one of the
golden rules of guerrilla warfare, once [neatly
summarized](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1969-01-01/viet-nam-negotiations) in
the Vietnam context by Henry Kissinger: "The guerrilla wins if he does
not lose. The conventional army loses if it does not win."

[In these historical conflicts, the belligerent that successfully
prioritized morale won. A wide-ranging RAND Corporation [report supports
this conclusion,
noting](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2300/RR2341/RAND_RR2341.pdf) that
"[failure of will has signaled the ending of]{.mark} almost [every
military conflict in world history."]{.mark} [Morale]{.mark}, then,
[should be considered a critical factor as the Ukrainian crisis
progresses]{.mark}]{.underline}. Predicting the outcome of this bloody
conflict is a difficult task, but [one possible outcome is a protracted
insurgency](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/05/russia-can-defeat-ukraine-it-cant-hold-territory/),
with Russian occupiers facing a fierce Ukrainian resistance. The fate of
such an insurgency would be determined by [many
factors](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2010/RAND_MG965.pdf),
including Russia's [counterinsurgency
strategy](https://mwi.usma.edu/dont-underestimate-the-bear-russia-is-one-of-the-worlds-most-effective-modern-counterinsurgents/),
the intervention of outside powers, and the morale of both sides. On the
latter point, in particular, Ukraine appears to hold a decisive
advantage.

Morale in the Russia-Ukraine War

[[Morale has been]{.mark} an [essential]{.mark} factor [in the]{.mark}
territorial [defense of Ukraine]{.mark}. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's
leadership has played a central role in keeping Ukrainian morale high;
he has repeatedly [rebuffed Russian disinformation]{.mark} through
public appearances around Kyiv and refused offers of Western
exfiltration, at one
point [declaring](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/europe/ukraine-zelensky-evacuation-intl/index.html),
"I need ammunition, not a ride." The media has [regaled Western publics
with accounts of heroism]{.mark}]{.underline}---such as the story of the
troops at Snake Island who were killed [(although that later proved
untrue)]{.underline} after defying a Russian warship with
the [proclamation](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/ukrainian-troops-snake-island-russian-warship/) "Russian
warship, go fuck yourself"---as well as stories of plucky Ukrainian
soldiers outwitting their far more powerful Russian counterparts, such
as
at [Kharkiv](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/us/politics/russia-ukraine-military.html),
where Ukrainian ambushes repeatedly stalled a Russian advance. Civil
society, meanwhile, has also stepped up, with one
journalist [summarizing the
atmosphere](https://coffeeordie.com/russian-invaders-ukraine-war/) as
"not a climate of fear or pessimism. Rather, there was a clear strength
forged by community action. A single purpose to which everyone had
subscribed---victory. And in that common cause all individual anxieties
seemed to fade."

But morale will likely play an even more important role in the
now-unraveling next phase, particularly if Russia ultimately succeeds in
occupying parts of eastern Ukraine. Insurgency and guerrilla warfare are
notoriously difficult to prosecute, and are sapping to energy and
spirit---guerrillas will face food and supply shortages, adverse
weather, and relentless manhunts. But the Ukrainian resistance will
receive sustained financial and political support, including from [an
international diaspora
movement](https://www.cfr.org/event/home-and-abroad-public-forum-us-russia-relations).
These are also excellent conditions for insurgency; [in the words
of](https://www.csis.org/events/assessing-russian-military-campaign-ukraine) former
US Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael Vickers, "Ukraine
has all the conditions going for it" to wage an insurgent campaign. And
Russia's reaction---to escalate bombings against civilian infrastructure
in an "[effort to break Ukrainian
morale](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1500357239428763649?cxt=HHwWgsCyxbi9q9IpAAAA)"---has
only fed Ukrainian anger and patriotism. As Ben Connable notes in
a [study of the will to fight on both
sides](https://www.lawfareblog.com/ukrainian-and-russian-will-fight-early-war-assessment),
Ukrainian morale may stay strong: "Given the existential nature of the
Russian invasion and the demonstrated power of Ukrainian national
identity, there is a good chance that the Ukrainians can sustain much of
their will to fight through the invasion and into a long-term
insurgency."

Russian morale, meanwhile, appears to be flagging. The Defense
Department
has [observed](https://www.c-span.org/video/?518455-1/pentagon-ukraines-airspace-remains-contested) "indications"
that Russian forces are suffering from low morale, which could be one
factor [frustrating the Russian
advance](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/us/politics/russia-ukraine-military.html?smid=tw-share) up
to this point. There are reports of [Russian
desertions](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/03/04/russias-brave-deserters-part-noble-military-tradition/) and [sabotage
of their own
weaponry](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/world/europe/russia-troops-pentagon.html);
many of Russia's frontline soldiers [were not even told they were going
to
war](https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-lied-to-russian-soldiers-left-them-unprepared-attack-nyt-2022-3).
Assassination attempts targeting Zelenskyy [have allegedly been
foiled](https://www.foxnews.com/world/chechen-hit-squad-sent-murder-zelenskyy-eliminated) by
Russia's own intelligence agencies. And while Ukrainians have been
galvanized into the streets by images of their battered, unshaven
president defying an invading enemy, Russians [have taken to the
streets](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/more-than-64-people-detained-anti-war-protests-russia-protest-monitor-2022-03-06/) to
protest the war.

[[Morale will grow increasingly important as]{.mark} the [conflict drags
on]{.mark}]{.underline}---and increasingly hard for Russia to sustain,
as Russian soldiers continue to realize there will not be a quick return
home, as their comrades head back in body bags, and as Russia's bombing
campaign [intensifies the resistance and global support for
Ukraine](https://twitter.com/ColinPClarke/status/1499787082885210117).

Next Steps

Asymmetric wars are not just asymmetric in capability but also in
stakes: the lesser force often faces an existential threat, and
therefore summons a spirit that an invading army simply cannot match.
Ukraine, as a nation seeing its right to self-determination in mortal
danger, will always maintain that advantage against Moscow. But
policymakers must also consider whether morale can be maintained,
constructed, or cajoled.

[Morale's importance offers the West an opportunity to push the war in
Ukraine's favor. [The information environment, and]{.mark} its
intersection with [cyber operations, could]{.mark} already [be shaping
morale in the ongoing conflict]{.mark}. So far, [Russia's use of cyber
operations in]{.mark} its invasion of [Ukraine has been
limited]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Despite
the [discovery](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-057a) of
destructive malware targeting organizations in Ukraine in January and
February, predictions that Russia would use highly destructive
cyberattacks to aid in its military operations [have not come
true](https://www.lawfareblog.com/cyber-realism-time-war). [Rather than
causing serious damage to Ukrainian critical infrastructure[, cyber
operations may]{.mark} leave a very different impact on the conflict:
[curb]{.mark}ing the [morale of Russian invaders]{.mark}. In the early
days of the invasion, [a]{.mark} Ukrainian [newspaper published the
personal information of 120,000 Russian troops, which was]{.mark}
possibly [obtained through cyber operations.]{.mark} Analysts
quickly [pointed
out](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3652370/purported-massive-leak-of-russian-soldiers-data-could-sink-morale-digital-security.html) how
[the exposure of this data could leave Russian soldiers vulnerable to
targeted anti-Russian messaging, further eroding the morale of the
invading forces]{.mark}.]{.underline} The leak came only days after the
hacktivist group Anonymous [declared "cyber
war"](https://twitter.com/YourAnonOne/status/1496965766435926039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1496965766435926039%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2022%2Ffeb%2F27%2Fanonymous-the-hacker-collective-that-has-declared-cyberwar-on-russia) on
Russia, subsequently conducted [denial-of-service

Russian government and state media websites,
and [posted](https://twitter.com/Anonymous_Link/status/1498607316836536320) data
allegedly belonging to the Russian Ministry of Economic Development on
Twitter.

Anonymous and other groups' hacktivism fits into the narrative that the
heroic, less capable Ukrainian forces are locked in a noble struggle
against the more powerful Russian aggressors. [[Information
operations]{.mark}, possibly [enabled by cyber operations, can further
promote such narratives,]{.mark} [complicating Russia's
counterinsurgency]{.mark} efforts.]{.underline}

As the United
States [weighs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/03/05/russia-ukraine-insurgency/) how
to support Ukraine, [it should recognize that [the US military has
already [created](https://www.c4isrnet.com/cyber/2021/12/29/new-us-army-cyber-unit-is-building-concepts-for-tactical-cyber-operations/) [multiple](https://www.airforcemag.com/16th-air-force-is-fully-up-and-running/) units
capable of integrating and projecting military power across the
information environment and the cyber domain]{.mark}. Should an
insurgency emerge, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should deploy
this capability to help maintain the conflict's narrative in favor of
Ukraine.]{.mark} Highlighting Russian atrocities, [using cyber
operations to expose the identities of those who target innocent
civilians]{.mark}, and [spreading messages about the heroism of the
Ukrainian people]{.mark} are just a few options to [bolster Ukrainian
morale while curbing]{.mark} [that of]{.mark} the [Russian]{.mark}
invaders]{.underline}. US military and covert operations to promote such
narratives should be accompanied by complementary diplomatic messaging,
as well as domestic political messaging from US leaders, to sustain the
American public and private sectors' support for pressuring Russia.
Given Western unity in countering Russia up to this point, it is likely
that US allies and partners will echo these messages.

[Understanding the history of [morale's role in insurgencies is
essential]{.mark} for analyzing the ongoing war in Ukraine and
developing sound policy options for what could be a drawn-out conflict.
But one thing seems clear: [Russia will struggle to win]{.mark} its war
[in Ukraine if its troops do not]{.mark} want to be there.]{.underline}

Getting to the truth

[Disinformation in war is nothing new---in fact, it's a key part of the
playbook. [Leaders commonly]{.mark} inflate or [fabricate
info]{.mark}rmation about everything from military might to supposed
atrocities [to confuse opponents or boost morale at home]{.mark}. Even
[Ukraine]{.mark} [has [appeared to
push](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/technology/ukraine-war-misinfo.html)]{.mark} some
wartime [narratives that may be false.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[But [with the rise of social media, propaganda can]{.mark} now be
[deployed on a much larger scale]{.mark}---and it has been [used to
garner support for genocide and]{.mark} other [h]{.mark}uman
[r]{.mark}ights [violations]{.mark}, including those against the Uyghur
population in China]{.underline}, the Rohingya in Myanmar, and Muslim
populations in India. To describe the growing role of online media in
political conflicts, Singer helped coin the term "LikeWar."

"If you think of cyber war as the hacking of networks, LikeWar is its
evil twin: the hacking of people on those networks, through our likes,
shares, and sometimes lies," said Singer, who is also a strategist and
senior fellow at the nonpartisan public policy institute New America.

[For years, [Russia has been waging---and winning]{.mark}---a LikeWar
against much of the world. The Kremlin has deployed tried-and-true
[psychological manipulation strategies via social and online
media]{.mark}, including disparaging outgroups and [rapid-fire
lying]{.mark}, according]{.underline} to research by Jon Roozenbeek,
PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in psychology at the University of Cambridge,
who studies mis- and disinformation and media discourse in Ukraine.

[Roozenbeek documented how the Kremlin [stoked outgroup animosity toward
Ukrainians a]{.mark}nd the Ukrainian [government during the takeover of
the Donetsk and Luhansk regions]{.mark} in eastern Ukraine, [a tactic
linked with high social media engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} ("[Media
and Identity in Wartime Donbas,

al., [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2024292118), Vol. 118,
No. 26, 2021).

Another ploy Russian President Vladimir Putin has used to great success
is conspiracy "gish gallop," or rapid-fire lying, said Roozenbeek, for
instance around the Malaysian Airlines disaster of 2014. The
Kremlin's [constant stream of
lies](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/combating-fake-news-the-21st-century-civic-duty-1.3739327)---that
it was a Ukrainian attack, that all the passengers were dead before
takeoff, that the pilot intentionally crashed the plane---is used to sow
confusion and disillusionment (Paul, C., & Matthews, M., [RAND
Corporation](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/perspectives/PE100/PE198/RAND_PE198.pdf.) (PDF,
177KB), 2016).

"It's a firehose of falsehoods that don't even hang together,"
Lewandowsky said. "They're just saying anything, literally anything, to
reinforce people's belief that you can never get to the truth."

[The Russian leader also uses specific leadership and aggressive tactics
to help justify violence, said Tin Nguyen]{.underline}, a research
associate at the National Counterterrorism, Innovation, Technology, and
Education Center who is completing his doctoral degree in
industrial-organizational psychology at Penn State University (Lovelace,
J. B., et al., [The Leadership

Methods](https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428104272182), Vol. 8, No. 1,
2005). [For example, Putin's strategies include [painting Ukraine and
Western nations as evil]{.mark} and immoral and [framing messages in
terms of power dynamics]{.mark}. If Russia is merely a victim that other
world powers are exploiting, the country has a justification for
revenge.]{.underline}

[[Russia's]{.mark} barbaric [invasion of Ukraine constitutes a]{.mark}
real and present [danger to]{.mark} world peace and [a rules-based order
in Europe]{.mark}. But even more ominous than Russian war crimes are the
neo-Stalinist ideas that the Kremlin is using to justify them. [Putin's
regime is implementing these designs]{.mark} inside Russia a[nd is
offering]{.mark} them for [export to the outside world in hopes of
helming a new global]{.mark} Comintern. That new International---the
[Antidemocracy International]{.mark}]{.underline}---while detached from
Soviet communism would still share similar aims, use similar tools to
seize power, and be similarly [fueled by anti-Western fury.]{.mark}

According to a recent Wall Street
Journal [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/vladimir-putins-20-year-march-to-war-in-ukraineand-how-the-west-mishandled-it-11648826461),
German chancellor Angela Merkel (2005--21) realized at the November 2014
G-20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, that Russian president Vladimir
Putin would never be open to a rapprochement with the West. During what
was to have been a discussion about Ukraine---Russia had annexed Crimea
earlier that year---Putin decried the decadence of democracies, citing
the "spread of 'gay culture'" as evidence. That assertion should sound
painfully familiar to people in Russia and Germany, where in the 1930s
such claims were used to justify the establishment of murderous
dictatorships. Astoundingly, some [right-wing media
commentators](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2022/02/23/these-conservatives-are-defending-russia-in-ukraine-crisis-and-trump-leads-the-way/?sh=49d2710b78cf)---rather
than finding such views alarming, as anyone who had lived under
Stalinism or fascism would have---have defended Putin and repeated his
lies to their audiences.

Even more ominous was Putin's statement in the same conversation with
Merkel that "[Russia's values were superior and diametrically opposed to
Western
decadence](https://www.wsj.com/articles/vladimir-putins-20-year-march-to-war-in-ukraineand-how-the-west-mishandled-it-11648826461)."
It was Nazi Germany's claim of racial superiority and the Stalinist
Soviet Union's claim of ideological superiority that underpinned their
attacks on other nations. Poland, viewed as inferior by both, was
invaded and carved up by the two powers during the Second World War in
accordance with the infamous 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, named for the
Russian and German foreign ministers. The claim of superiority---of
values and of national heritage (the Russian Empire and the Soviet
Union)---is a key to understanding the war crimes and genocidal nature
of Russia's war on Ukraine today. To Putin, all means are justified in
dealing with inferior people, who should be either forced into
submission or eliminated. The appeasers in Europe, such Hungary's
Premier Viktor Orbán and Serbia's President Aleksandar Vučić, should
take note of Russia's history and of the fact that Putin views Russia as
superior not only to Ukraine but to the entire West.

At that same 2014 meeting, Putin, following Stalin, also made it clear
that his contempt for the West extended beyond the cultural to the
political. Leaders in democracies, in Putin's view, will always be weak,
hamstrung as they are by the need to win votes. Sergey Karaganov, a
former top advisor to Putin and now honorary chair of the Moscow Council
for Foreign and Defense Policy, like many Kremlin mouthpieces has stated
Putin's antidemocratic views even more plainly. In an April 2022
interview, [Karaganov
said](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/ukraine/2022/04/russia-cannot-afford-to-lose-so-we-need-a-kind-of-a-victory-sergey-karaganov-on-what-putin-wants) that
Russia must win its war against Ukraine, but also made it clear that the
real adversary in this war is the West, whose "moral foundation" is in
question. Explaining the Kremlin's strategic calculus, Karaganov said
that "democracy in its present form in most European countries will not
survive, because under circumstances of great tension \[such as the
covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine\], democracies always wither
away or become autocratic. These changes are inevitable." One has only
to remember the British resistance to the German Blitz (1940--41) during
World War II to see the obvious lie buried in his words.

Russia's Never-Ending Battle

[While [Kremlin policies are]{.mark} no longer focused on achieving a
communist victory over capitalism, they are still [aimed at destroying
Western democracy]{.mark}. A]{.underline} look back at the history of
Russian-Western tensions shows how they escalated into political,
cultural, and economic confrontation at the start of 2022, and why
democracy has emerged as the key issue in that conflict.

The demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 raised hope that democracies
could be established in Russia and Ukraine, along with other newly
independent states. The West declared the end of the Cold War and
welcomed those developments, but offered little practical support,
particularly economic, to Russia's reformers. (This must not be repeated
with Ukraine today.) In the end, the old guard in Moscow allowed
democratic and rebel nationalist forces to sweep away ascetic communism
rather easily but were afraid of democracy. To preserve their dominance,
the corrupt civil and military-security bureaucracies led by the KGB
counterattacked the reformers. Most of all, the old guard worked to
retain control of key natural-resource--based industries, especially
oil. These holdovers were---and are---after power and money. They spent
their spoils on luxuries in the democratic West and on propaganda
machines and police to keep the population in check at home. This type
of Russian state capitalism developed its hypocritical creed both as a
cover for the corruption and plunder and as a message to the people not
to protest.

I remember debating with old-guard front men during my time in
government. Their line of argument sounded like an amalgam of primitive
nationalism and religious and cultural clichés. The Bolsheviks, they
argued, first created the Soviet Union, a superpower, and then built the
Cheka (the KGB's predecessor) to guard the USSR from internal and
external challenges. But the communists failed to recognize the flaw in
their ideology: If you force people to make sacrifices to achieve the
unattainable---paradise on earth---sooner or later, they will become
frustrated and revolt. That is exactly what happened in the Soviet
Union. Since the fall of communism, the Kremlin, my opponents insisted,
should preach pravoslavie (orthodoxy), which promises paradise in heaven
but requires sacrifices in the name of the Russian state---the fortress,
defended by the Federal Security Bureau (the KGB's successor) and army,
that stands against the infidels of the decadent West, led by the United
States. And now came their ace card: Whatever one thinks about
friendship between the two, Russia simply cannot afford to lose the
United States as a clear enemy in the eyes of the people, the army, and
the government. It needs a common enemy to unite them.

This eclectic and false blend of religion and patriotism became the
postcommunist surrogate for a state ideology. It is called Pravoslavny
Chekism, as odd as that might sound given that the Cheka from its
inception repressed the church and religion. Pravoslavny Chekism and its
proponents gradually found their way to President Boris Yeltsin
(1991--99), who had played a key role in the demise of the Soviet Union
and the emergence of the new Russian state in the early 1990s. A former
provincial Communist Party apparatchik, he denounced communism and
raised the banner of democracy in his fight for power. Yet he was hardly
genuinely devoted to its implementation and, meeting resistance, began
sliding back into more traditional ways of governance. Yeltsin's choice
of Vladimir Putin, a little-known St. Petersburg politician and former
KGB officer, as his successor in 1999 was not accidental.

By that time, the reform process had slowed to a crawl, with the
emerging free-market system leaving the Russian people with a huge bill
and no means to pay it. The promised benefits of capitalism and
democracy seemed nowhere in sight. At the same time, bureaucrats and
crony entrepreneurs became millionaire oligarchs almost overnight. The
prodemocracy forces lost credibility by continuing to support Yeltsin
unconditionally and failing to act as an independent counterweight. As a
result, democrats lost two free and fair parliamentary elections (in
1994 and 1995) to ultranationalists and neocommunists, who capitalized
on the hardships wrought by the half-hearted reforms. None of the
parties in parliament managed to provide an attractive alternative to
the political and economic course---Pravoslavny Chekism and crony
capitalism---ordained by Yeltsin and his bureaucracy.

[Once in power, Putin and his team of former-KGB troopers doubled down
on that course, solidifying control of the main industries and media.
[Parliament was]{.mark} eventually [reduced to a stage show]{.mark} and
rubber stamp for Putin's policies, a sign that democracy was in
danger]{.underline}. For Putin's circle, the Cold War has never ended.
The collapse of the Soviet Union was just one lost battle in an ongoing
war with the West, which was to blame for Russia's domestic failures
both before and after the fall. While the prodemocracy press began
withering from lack of financing under Yeltsin and especially Putin,
ex-Soviet journalists at home and abroad were receiving KGB-arranged
sponsorships from crony capitalists and quickly resumed churning out
their traditional blame-the-West, fear-NATO headlines.

[Once [Putin]{.mark} had consolidated his grip on power in Russia, the
Kremlin followed the Soviet example and [went on provoking the West
with]{.mark} daring statements, local hot wars, and [disinformation and
subversion campaigns]{.mark}]{.underline}. The feeble international
response to their actions, especially in Crimea, the Donbas, and Syria,
convinced the Kremlin that the United States and the West had, since
declaring the arrival of the post--Cold War era, relaxed to the point of
having lost the will to resist. Russia even tested the effectiveness
of [threatening nuclear
war](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/russias-nuclear-threats-recast-cold-war-dangers-delicate-balance-terror-revisited).
Apparently, it does still work in deterring stronger Western support for
Ukraine's fight for freedom. The past seventy years of the nuclear era,
however, had already proven that the only effective strategy for
preventing such a war was to make unleashing it a suicidal act. Yet
bowing to nuclear blackmail is also suicidal, as it opens the door for
blackmailers to make endless demands.

Authoritarian Aggression Must Be Checked

[The more determined democracies are to avoid war, the greater the risk
that autocracies will wage it. [The claim of military success helps
autocrats to seize]{.mark} and hold [power]{.mark}. Thus, [the war in
Ukraine will]{.mark} likely be a defining moment for Russia that will
also [have repercussions all over the world]{.mark}. [If the West
allows]{.mark} [Putin to claim victory]{.mark} in Ukraine,
[antidemocracy populists everywhere will celebrate]{.mark}, believing
that they can do whatever they want, [and Putin will cement his
dictatorship in Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} Not only his acolytes in
government but also a large part of the Russian populace will believe
the Kremlin propaganda telling them that Putin's leadership is amassing
victories. If Russia wins this war, his agents of influence and useful
idiots in the West will be singing his praises while police repression
in Russia is ratcheted up even more---just to be on the safe side.

A few weeks after the beginning of the invasion, Putin pushed several
laws through his puppet parliament and signed executive orders basically
criminalizing all forms of dissent and the remnants of independent
media. These moves, as Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the
now-shuttered Carnegie Moscow
Center, [wrote](https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/04/06/how-silent-assent-made-bucha-possible-pub-86822),
resemble the Nazification of German society (a process known as
Gleichschaltung) after the Nazi's seized power in 1933. Hitler sought to
"coordinate" and control all political, social, cultural, and
educational institutions in the name of national unity.

But Russia does not need the example of Nazi Germany, however striking
the parallels may be, to serve as a roadmap. Russia has its own
totalitarian legacy---Josef Stalin's ruthless dictatorship, which
Putin's Russia is increasingly coming to resemble. For example, a new
law passed in March makes public statements that contradict the Kremlin
on the war in Ukraine punishable by up to fifteen years in prison. "The
history of mass execution and political imprisonment in the Soviet era,
and the denunciation of fellow citizens encouraged by the state . . .
now looms over Russia's deepening . . .
repression," [writes](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/world/europe/putin-russia-war-ukraine.html) Anton
Troianovski. As in Soviet times, the more that ordinary people fear
being suspected of disloyalty to the Kremlin, the more likely they will
be to turn on each other. Repression and intimidation are key pillars of
a totalitarian state that reduces citizens to an obedient population.
In [the words of Bertrand
Russell](https://books.google.com/books?id=qmFQlCiXZHIC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=herd&f=false),
"collective fear stimulates herd instinct and tends to produce ferocity
towards those who are not regarded as members of the herd."

The collective fear of repression is a fierce enemy of democracy, but it
is not the only driver of the herd mentality so necessary to
totalitarianism. Fear of changing social dynamics---such as cultural
pluralism, rapid technical development, and globalization---which many
find especially hard to keep up with, also builds the herd. Putin's base
resides predominantly outside of Moscow and other major urban centers,
is notably less educated, and comprises a mass of angry, struggling
people. The older ones are nostalgic for the days when they were young
and the grass was green, forgetting of course that they had frequently
suffered under the old order. The younger ones are a mob of poorly
educated malcontents looking for a strongman to transform them from the
losers of modern society into its winners.

People who are afraid of change seek solace in scapegoating an "enemy,"
simply defined as different, untraditional, or foreign. Putin's
propaganda succeeded in portraying Ukraine as an immediate enemy that
can and should be trampled for breaking away from Mother Russia and for
being the proxy of far greater and more distant adversaries---the United
States and NATO. Defeating those enemies would help to keep the Russian
herd under control and disprove the idea that Russia's cousins next door
could ever go it alone and choose democracy.

Putin's full-scale aggression in Ukraine has galvanized the
Antidemocracy International---from the Chinese Communist Party to the
U.S. ultraright.
Many [believed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/05/21/russia-ukraine-victory/) that
Russia would win quickly and easily. As Washington was warning of the
massive Russian military buildup on the Ukrainian border, Chinese
president Xi Jinping and Putin met on 4 February 2022, ahead of the
Beijing Olympics. They signed a long communiqué outlining future areas
of cooperation and claimed there were "[no
limits](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-vladimir-putin-meets-with-chinese-leader-xi-jinping-in-beijing-11643966743)"
to their commitments.

At about the same time, former U.S. president Donald Trump, still a
leader of the Republican Party, [spoke admiringly of
Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/26/donald-trump-georgia-republican-primary-rally) to
a crowd of supporters, saying "they ask me, 'Is Putin smart?' Yes, Putin
was smart. And I thought he was going to be negotiating. I said, 'That's
a hell of a way to negotiate, put 200,000 soldiers on the border.'" In
those awkwardly worded remarks one can recognize the Putinesque
leitmotifs of mocking an elected leader for being weak and praising a
dictator for using or threatening armed force, regardless of its being
in violation of existing norms of civilized behavior. No wonder it came
from a politician who tried to hold on to power despite having lost an
election. In Russia, "smart Putin" has freed himself from such burdens
by simply doctoring electoral results in his and his supporters' favor.

Europe's far right has had its own romance with the Russian autocrat for
many years. Hungary's Orbán has long been viewed as a potential leader
of the new Antidemocracy International by [right-wing
advocates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hungary-budapest-viktor-orban-conservative-dreher-europe-eu-11649716947) in
the United States. Orbán's coalition won almost 53 percent of the vote
in Hungary's April 2022 election versus the opposition's 34 percent. In
Serbia, the unapologetically pro-Putin Aleksandar Vučić was reelected
president in April 2022 by a sweeping margin. In France, Marine Le Pen,
leader of the far-right National Rally, is literally [indebted to
Putin](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/world/europe/le-pen-putin-france-election.html).
Her party, denied financing from French banks, took out a US\$12.2
million loan from a Russian bank in 2014. In the first round of France's
April 2022 presidential election, [Le Pen came in second to Emmanuel
Macron for a second
time](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/a-dangerous-facade/), but by a
significantly narrower margin than in 2017. (She was, however, soundly
beaten in the runoff.)

[European and [U.S. right-wing populism is similar to that of Russia in
the make-up of its political base and in its
messaging]{.mark}.]{.underline} Trump, Orbán, and Le Pen voters tend to
be less urban, have less formal education, and be more anxious about the
rapidly changing cultural and economic landscapes. [The [rhetoric
of]{.mark} these aspiring [autocrats,]{.mark} like Putin's, [signals to
their followers that]{.mark} the dizzying complexity of [the modern
world is]{.mark} actually nothing more than [a battle between a good
"us" and a bad "them,"]{.mark}]{.underline} whose ranks include
foreigners and minorities as well as, in the case of Russia, the
decadent West and liberals, who represent all the above. This is a sign
that democracy is in danger.

The End of Ideology

Despite similarities, however, the leaders of the Antidemocracy
International have no unifying or consistent set of ideas. They simply
want power for themselves. It is only the rejection of democracy that
brings them together. But it cannot mobilize a mass movement to the
extent of self-destructive social engineering and world war in the way
that messianic ideologies have. The two most portentous examples of such
mass madness---Soviet communism and Nazi fascism---were defeated and
discredited in the twentieth century. In the twenty-first century,
Muslim fundamentalism, another potential stirrer of mass hyperdelirium,
has failed to produce anything more than terrorism, thereby securing its
worldwide rejection. There is an animated debate concerning the end of
history, but the history of ideologies is over, at least for now.

What has emerged in their place? The now-universal ideas of a market
economy and a publicly supported government. As it turns out, however,
implementing them takes a lot of work. Democracy is not an ideology. But
it is the best of all forms of government, all of which (including
democracy) are imperfect. Autocracy, in contrast, is a bad form of
government. Democracy---with its endless debates and elaborate
procedures, and seemingly dominated by a globalized, overeducated
elite---may appear too mundane and uninspiring to win over the doubters
who are overwhelmed by modern life. They instead take refuge in dreams
of reviving the past. Those dreams are what nurture and feed the
populists and autocrats.

Yet for many, nothing is more inspiring than freedom. Thus the fearless
Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was able to mobilize and unite
his people to fight the Russian invaders, and has called for building
Ukraine's democracy and for [joining
Europe](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/ukraine-belongs-in-the-eu/).
The international response to Putin's aggression in Ukraine has also
been encouraging. Both sides of the political aisle in the United States
have supported providing assistance to Ukraine. A divided electorate in
France banded together to defeat Le Pen, and after Orbán's win at the
polls, Hungary supported the EU's decision to impose a [fifth set of
sanctions](https://www.rferl.org/a/eu-sanctions-russia-ban-coal/31792723.html) on
Russia. Although China and India abstained from condemning the Russian
war, they have also refrained from providing Moscow with any meaningful
assistance, especially military support. And even though they are
clearly taking advantage of Russia's self-imposed trading limits in the
Western markets by buying Russian oil at huge discounts, Moscow's old
dream of creating an anti-Western axis with the two Asian giants remains
unrealized. Putin's friendship with Xi has proved far from limitless.
Both Beijing and New Delhi understand the difference between words
denouncing the existing world order and deeds able to damage it. In
contrast to a declining Russia, China and India are rising and
increasingly able to compete with the United State and Europe for
influence on the international stage and a better place within the
existing world order, amended to their taste but not destroyed.

Putin's war on Ukraine has laid bare the critical need to defend and
promote democracy in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere. But it
has also demonstrated democracy's amazing resilience. [The [brutality of
the Russian war has reminded people everywhere of the existential danger
that autocracy poses]{.mark} because it relies on violence at home and,
in many cases, abroad. [Prodemocracy forces in the Wes]{.mark}t and
beyond [have mobilized]{.mark} once again. Democracy is still on the
march, however treacherous the path ahead may be.]{.underline}

the capacity for [wholly manufactured yarns or deliberately
misrepresented
half-truths](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html). In
fact, we see evidence of these capabilities, advantages, and this
willingness working on some of Russia's target audiences. [[In]{.mark}
Russia and small pockets of [eastern Ukraine]{.mark}, [anecdotal
reporting](https://www.newsweek.com/russian-journalist-says-some-believe-country-fighting-hitler-ukraine-1686077) indicates
that some [audiences are buying the Kremlin]{.mark}
line. [Stories](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/world/europe/ukraine-russia-families.html) of
Russians refusing to believe their Ukrainian family members' own
harrowing [personal accounts of the
war](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60600487) have
surfaced. ]{.underline}

Kyiv restaurateur Misha Katsurin, who posted on Instagram about his
father's refusal to acknowledge Russia's role as the aggressor, received
an outpouring of support in the form of [135,000 likes and
shares](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/didn-t-believe-ukrainian-launches-230750845.html),
and hundreds of comments by people with similar experiences. Katsurin
has since established a site, [Papa
pover](https://papapover.com/en/) ("Dad, believe") designed to help
Ukrainians engage family members in Russia who believe the Kremlin's
stories. The site has gathered a catalogue of disinformation narratives
and suggestions about scripted responses. 

In Russia, the de-Nazification narrative [is not
new](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russian-soldiers-ukraine-anger-duped-into-war).
Talking heads on Russian state-operated TV---which [62 percent of
Russians rely on for
news](https://www.levada.ru/2021/08/05/rossijskij-medialandshaft-2021/),
according to recent polling---have spent the past eight
years [fearmongering](https://russian.rt.com/inotv/2014-03-07/Nacisti-v-Kieve-sovershenno-ne) about
this
supposed [threat](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/05/03/309006428/russia-condemns-ukraine-with-comparisons-to-nazis).
Years-[long
exposure](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-021-00301-5) to
such narratives can have a profound and durable [effect on one's
perceptions](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20445414?seq=1) and beliefs.
It's the first-mover advantage, reinforced by [repetition and
familiarity](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html). [In
fact, [[58 percent of
Russian]{.mark}s](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/not-just-putin-most-russians-support-the-war-in-ukraine/) polled
between February 28 and March 3 [indicated approval for the invasion of
Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline} This suggests that attempts to message to,
influence, and/or mobilize Russian military personnel or the broader
public may fall on deaf ears for much of this audience. 

The claims to be rooting out supposed Nazis are but one element of
Russia's broader information campaign. Perhaps recognizing the failure
of these early narratives to take root among global publics, the Kremlin
has pivoted to manufacturing conspiracies on Ukrainian chemical,
biological, and nuclear weapons programs. Though similarly far-fetched
on their face, these stories are at least plausible, in that most
industrial countries have chemical production and laboratories, and
Ukraine has a history of [weapons
manufacture](https://carnegieendowment.org/2014/07/30/saving-ukraine-s-defense-industry-pub-56282) dating
back to the Soviet era. What's more, the believability of this narrative
is aided by the fact that it is rooted in a kernel of truth: In early
March, a U.S. authority figure, Under Secretary of State Victoria
Nuland, [confirmed](https://www.c-span.org/video/?518355-1/secretary-state-political-affairs-testifies-ukraine) to
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Ukraine is home to
biological research facilities, a fact which Russia has [latched onto
and distorted](https://ria.ru/20220311/laboratorii-1777710523.html). 

[More concerning for U.S. policymakers is the fact that these
[narratives]{.mark} and others [propagated by]{.mark} [Russian
officials]{.mark} and their proxies [appear to be [gaining some
traction](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/10/bioweapons-ukraine-russia-disinformation/) among]{.mark}
segments of [the U.S. public.]{.mark} If Russia's past propensity
to [target American
audiences](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf) is any
indication[, more disinformation]{.mark} and propaganda of this nature
[is likely forthcoming]{.mark}.]{.underline} And Russia possesses other
instruments in its informational toolkit. Within Russia, for instance,
the Kremlin has tightened its grip on information with the
implementation of a sweeping set of new restrictions
on [journalism](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/03/russia-kremlins-ruthless-crackdown-stifles-independent-journalism-and-anti-war-movement/) and [social
media](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/07/1085025672/russia-social-media-ban).
Meanwhile, President Biden has recently warned the nation against the
increasing [likelihood of Russian
cyberattacks](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/evolving-intelligence-suggests-russia-may-target-us-businesses-cyberat-rcna20921).
Moreover, this first month of the war in Ukraine
has [demonstrated](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-invasion-russia-fake-pretext/31685484.html) Russia's
willingness to use [false-flag
operations](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/04/false-flag-invasions-are-a-russian-specialty/) and
various other [instruments of
subversion](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE331.html) in
service of political and military ends. 

For its part, the evidence so far suggests that the Ukrainian government
has mounted a stunningly sophisticated informational campaign in an
effort to shape global opinions, to rouse domestic morale, and to
persuade Russian soldiers to lay down their arms. Aided by the U.S.
intelligence community's exposure of Kremlin machinations and the
introduction of [unprecedented intelligence sharing
practices](https://warontherocks.com/2022/03/intelligence-disclosures-in-the-ukraine-crisis-and-beyond/),
officials in Kyiv have mounted a coordinated yet agile, high-volume,
multi-platform information effort. In the first moments of the conflict,
Zelensky deftly [set the
narrative](https://twitter.com/zelenskyyua/status/1496787304811315202?lang=en) in
the informational battlespace, hijacking and inverting Moscow's attempts
to paint the authorities in Kyiv as fascists---instead casting the
Kremlin as Nazis by tapping into deeply rooted historical memories of
the Second World War. 

From compelling captured-soldier videos, to social media posts targeting
Russian troops, to the daily video updates from officials in Kyiv
demonstrating continuity of government, to Zelensky's tailored remarks
to legislators, the Ukrainian leadership has used the information
environment to its advantage. U.S. analysts, scholars, and practitioners
of influence and information campaigns would benefit from monitoring,
dissecting, and learning from Ukrainian information efforts. 

The Ukrainian government's information campaign over the past five weeks
offers another important dimension to this lesson: that sophisticated
information capabilities are not built in a day but honed over time. In
2014, Kyiv's messaging in the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea and
incursions into in the Donbas was [incongruous and
slow](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR4373z1.html). [Officials
reported divergent casualty
figures](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR4373z1.html),
which Russian actors exploited in their messaging as evidence of the
incompetence of authorities in Kyiv. Since then, Ukraine has invested in
and [retooled](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/12/ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-russia-propaganda-media-medvedchuk-euromaidan-kremlin-hybrid-war/) its
approach to the informational aspects of crisis and conflict ([in some
cases](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/tug-war-ukraines-information-space-media-bans-versus-freedom-speech) drawing
criticism), resulting in the robust capability we're witnessing today. 

The U.S. has allowed its information warfare and influence capabilities
to atrophy before, particularly in periods of relative peace
following [World War
II](https://ahec.armywarcollege.edu/documents/A_Return_to_Information_Warfare.pdf) and
fall of the Iron Curtain. There are several reasons for this neglect.
[First, [those in the U.S. government responsible for
info]{.mark}rmation and influence [activities have]{.mark} long [been
entrenched in [lexical and sectarian
disputes](https://www.rand.org/blog/2019/03/is-it-time-to-abandon-the-term-information-operations.html)]{.mark}.
Put simply, [there is little agreement on what to call
info]{.mark}rmation [activities]{.mark} and who is responsible
for]{.underline} them. Relatedly, the U.S. government community
responsible for information efforts has also suffered from an optics
problem. 

In the wake of WWII, previously accepted terms of art including
"propaganda," "information warfare," and "psychological warfare," and
their associated activities [gained a reputation as
unsavory](https://warontherocks.com/2019/06/the-united-states-needs-an-information-warfare-command-a-historical-examination/).
[What is more, [informational activities do not fit neatly within any
one DOD portfolio]{.mark} where a largely [kinetic-focused
culture](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2021/11/joint-chiefs-information-officer-us-behind-information-warfare-ai-can-help/186670/) has
meant [these capabilities are often treated as "an
afterthought...]{.mark}laminated on to" existing plans]{.underline}, in
the words of former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph
Dunford, Jr. Lastly, the U.S. lacks a national-level information
strategy and/or body to set guidance and serve as arbiter between the
various entities with hands in this space. 

[Recently, leaders in the Defense Department and broader [U.S.
government]{.mark} [acknowledged](https://www.c4isrnet.com/information-warfare/2019/07/11/joint-chiefs-nominee-wants-to-boost-information-warfare/) the
criticality of information in conflict and competition. In this vein,
federal agencies and the armed services have taken steps to
institutionalize this refocusing through the establishment of
informationally-focused [organizations](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/IN10744.pdf), [units](https://www.c4isrnet.com/dod/air-force/2019/10/14/what-the-new-16th-air-force-means-for-information-warfare/),
and [positions in
leadership](https://www.c4isrnet.com/c2-comms/2018/05/18/marines-get-new-information-war-leader/https:/www.c4isrnet.com/c2-comms/2018/05/18/marines-get-new-information-war-leader/).
Even so, recent research in this arena has indicated that these [nascent
efforts]{.mark} still [have a [long way to
go](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR4373z1.html)]{.mark}.
[It would]{.mark} seem to [be a mistake to take Russia's recent
blunders]{.mark} in the information space in Ukraine as reasons
[to]{.mark} deprioritize or [reduce American investments in its
info]{.mark}rmational [capabilities.]{.mark}  ]{.underline}

Australia and [[the West's soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark} of today [[are
part of a]{.mark} globalised [info]{.mark}rmation [age which is]{.mark}
[resulting in]{.mark} the West's]{.underline} continued
[[detribalisation]{.underline}]{.mark}.34 In other words, [[by]{.mark}
today's [soldiers accessing]{.mark} and processing [knowledge]{.mark}
from across the world [they are facilitating]{.mark}]{.underline} for
themselves [[mor]{.mark}e [diverse views]{.mark}]{.underline} and
opinions [[that challenge]{.mark}]{.underline} dominant [[Western
paradigms]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline} which serve to
[[erode]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[consensus]{.underline}]{.mark}. Put
another way, [their actions potentially]{.underline} serve to [[erode
the will to fight]{.underline}]{.mark}, a will which relies on a "sense
of identity, belonging and cause".35 Quite simply, the already dynamic
process of human relations and discourse is becoming even more dynamic.
[[Daesh]{.underline}]{.mark}, seizing on the phenomenon, [[is
making]{.mark} expert [use of social media]{.mark} in its
propaganda]{.underline} efforts [[by using it as an **information
weapon**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and in the realm of stated war aims,
social media is extenuating the strategic debate. The main allegation
commentators level against the international coalition's fight against
Daesh in Iraq and Syria is its lack of strategy or, to put it another
way, the purpose of its stated war aims. This is in the context of
perceived previous politicomilitary failures in the Middle East, which
many argue have resulted in the rise of Daesh. In a theoretical sense,
what this means is that [an already detribalising West]{.underline}
along [with its [soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline} are afforded
[[access]{.mark}]{.underline} via [[social media to]{.underline}]{.mark}
an ever expanding, dissenting discourse which serves to [[lower
morale]{.underline}.]{.mark} The important effect social media has here
stems from the realm of memory studies and the way in which meaning is
created. Put simply, meaning is created in the space between history and
imagination, which in the present spectrum of modern conflict is a
recipe for a decrease in the West's will to fight for their ideals and
values. In other words, the history of [past [failures coup]{.mark}led
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} proliferated [[online content makes
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the questioning of the ends and a [greater
potential for dissent]{.underline}, with all of its attendant
consequences. For example[, the potential [drop in voluntary military
recruitment]{.mark} numbers [and increase]{.mark} in military
[separations]{.mark}]{.underline} (people quitting or worse,
disserting). Social media's detribalising effect in the spectrum of
modern conflict certainly requires further research. Turning to morale's
exogenous situational factor one can argue that
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the spectrum of [[modern conflict social media
has the greatest practical impact]{.mark}.]{.underline} Well before the
notion of social media was fathomable, David Galula, a leading military
and academic figure of counterinsurgency warfare, provided a prescient
warning in 1968 which typifies the threat to morale posed by Daesh's use
of social media today when he said, "the insurgent \[is\] judged by what
he promises, not by what he does \... the counterinsurgent \[is\] judged
on what he does, not on what he says".36 Certainly the increase in the
amount of information available is synonymous with the information age
and social media. Certainly also the quality and authenticity of much of
that information is questionable---all of which feeds the potentiality
of rumour and friction in the context of success and failure. From the
Australian Defence Force's force protection perspective, two practical
examples of social media's likely impact on the morale of the men and
women of its Air Task Group (ATG) conducting combat operations against
Daesh in Iraq and Syria are available. I say likely as this is an area
also requiring further research. Force protection relates to the
identification of threats to the force, and the mitigation and control
of those threats, which is a process of risk management. In this sense
then, it is not difficult to appreciate that defending morale falls
within the remit of force protection. First, take
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} horrifically barbaric February 2015
[[burning-alive of]{.mark} the caged and conscious [Jordanian pilot by
Daesh]{.mark}]{.underline} in Syria, subsequently [[disseminated by
social media]{.mark}]{.underline} and widely reported on by the Western
media. That, more than likely, [[had a]{.mark} material [impact on the
ATG's]{.mark}]{.underline} exogenous situational factor of
[[morale]{.mark}.]{.underline} In an already heightened force protection
state it is not hard to imagine that social media's transmission of the
act would have caused a high degree of increased 'home-front' friction
for the families of the ATG's aircrews. In other words, an increase in
the ATG's families' associated levels of concern and worry. The impact
too in turn potentially feeds back into morale's political factor of the
stated war aim, spurring the debate surrounding the question of 'is this
really worth risking lives for an apparently uncertain end?' Daesh's use
of social media in this case, as with their media content from their
victories in Mosul and Ramadi, is an example of degrading the West's
situational factor of morale by highlighting their perceived victory and
the coalition's failure. Separately, although related in the realm of
morale, was [[Daesh's]{.mark} so called ['Hacking
Division's']{.mark}]{.underline} August 2015 publication via social
media [of a "hit list"]{.underline} [[containing]{.mark}, supposedly,
around [1,400 peoples' details]{.mark},]{.underline} including mobile
phone numbers, credit card details, online passwords and private emails.
[Of those 1,400 [the]{.mark}]{.underline} Australian Government
confirmed [the [leak included the personal info]{.mark}rmation
[of]{.mark} Australian Defence Force ([ADF]{.mark})]{.underline}
employees.37 If the ATG and their families were not already overly
apprehensive, one imagines their perception of Daesh's domestic threat
and potential reach increased somewhat if not dramatically. How does the
ADF Presently Defend and How Might It Better Defend against Social
Media's Threat to Morale? From a force protection perspective, the ADF
has measures in place to defend against social media's threat to morale.
Personnel are educated on the use of social media and on what personal
security measures should be followed and what operational security
(OPSEC) measures must be followed. These are important and necessary
requirements for defending the military capability of morale. From a
technical perspective, however, there is not a lot else one may
implement short of banning social media's use,38 which like our existing
approach would fall within the realm of information as data and
commodity.39 Put another way, this relates to the military's traditional
approach to OPSEC and "the information security triad of
confidentiality, integrity and availability".40 The important point here
is that that approach, although important, fails to acknowledge the
greater power of information as image and perception in the world of
social media.41 Information as image and perception means information
must be seen as a resource for shaping perception and imagination, which
in turn is a more potent way of defending and, more importantly,
strengthening morale.42 In the realm of modern conflict, social media
and morale; attack is the best form of defence. Rather than being overly
shielding we must facilitate and encourage soldiers to take up social
media and get deep into the discourse it richly enables. Soldiers must
go 'waist-deep', get personal, communicate the reality, create bonds,
expand networks and proactively contribute to the collective shaping of
perception and image. [Our [soldiers]{.mark} [need to be
outfront]{.mark}]{.underline}. With clarity, simplicity, common
intelligibility and realistic interpretation,43 [[their]{.mark}
authentic first-hand [social media]{.mark}]{.underline} content should
evoke identities and perceptions that create meanings, [which [in
turn]{.mark}]{.underline} serve to [[boost morale]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Such an approach's [strength lies in the content's
authenticity]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this way, akin to a constructivist
approach within security studies, the will can be positively influenced
through "behaviour \[which\] is always socially constructed,
historically determined, and culturally contingent".44 Conversely, a
weakness of such an approach will stem from the tension between the
opportunity for the soldier to engage independently and the strategic
imperative dictated by policy, which is inherently political.Conclusion
[[Social media]{.mark}]{.underline} has and [[will]{.mark}]{.underline}
continue to [[change the]{.underline}]{.mark} character of [[morale or

#### Social media scams extort the U.S. military, leads to soldiers sharing valuable information with adversaries. 

**Lange** July 31, **2019** Katie Lange, Social Media/Public Affairs
specialist, senior digital producer, writer and editor, temple
university bachelors degree of arts. These social media scams affect the

Accessed 7-11-22, BVW-RB

Nowadays, you have to be cautious of everything you do online. [Scammers
are always trying to get money, goods or services out of unsuspecting
people --- and military members are often targets. Here are some
[scams]{.mark} that [have recently been affecting service members,
Defense Department employees and their families]{.mark}. Romance Scams
In April, [Army]{.mark} Criminal Investigation [Command put out a
warning about romance scams in which]{.mark} online [predators]{.mark}
go on dating sites [claim]{.mark}ing [to be deployed active-duty
soldiers]{.mark}.]{.underline} It\'s a problem that\'s affecting all
branches of service --- not just the Army. CID said there have been
hundreds of claims each month from people who said they\'ve been scammed
on legitimate dating apps and social media sites. According to the
alleged victims, the scammers have asked for money for fake
service-related needs such as transportation, communications fees,
processing and medical fees --- even marriage. CID said many of the
victims have lost tens of thousands of dollars and likely won\'t get
that money back. **Remember**: Service members and government employees
DO NOT PAY to go on leave, have their personal effects sent home or fly
back to the U.S. from an overseas assignment. Scammers will sometimes
provide [false
paperwork](https://www.cid.army.mil/romance-scam-examples.html) to make
their case, but real service members make their own requests for time
off. Also, any official military or government emails will end in .mil
or .gov --- not .com --- so be suspicious if you get a message claiming
to be from the military or government that doesn't have one of those
addresses. If you\'re worried about being scammed, know what [red flags
to look for](https://www.cid.army.mil/romancescam.html). If you think
you\'ve been a victim, contact the [FBI Internet Crime Complaint
Center](https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx) and the [Federal Trade
Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/). [[DOD officials said]{.mark} task
forces are working to deal with the growing problem, but the [scammers
are often]{.mark} from African nations and are using cyber cafes with
untraceable email addresses, then routing their accounts across the
world to make them [incredibly difficult to trace]{.mark}]{.underline}.
So be vigilant! [\'Sextortion\' Sexual extortion --- known as
\"[sextortion]{.mark}\" --- [is]{.mark} when a service member is seduced
into sexual activities online that are unknowingly recorded and [used
against]{.mark} them for money or goods]{.underline}. Often, if a victim
caves on a demand, the scammer will just likely demand more.[[Service
members]{.mark} [\[Who\] are attractive targets for these
scammers]{.mark} for a few reasons: ]{.underline}They\'re often young
men who are away from home and have an online presence. They have a
steady income and are often more financially stable than civilians.
Because of their careers, they\'re held to a higher standard of
conduct. [[Military members have security clearances and **know things**
]{.mark}that might be **[of interest to
adversaries]{.mark}**. ]{.underline}To avoid falling victim to
sextortion, don\'t post or exchange compromising photos or videos with
ANYONE online, and make sure your social media privacy settings limit
the information outsiders can see --- this includes advertising your
affiliation with the military or government. Be careful when you\'re
communicating with anyone you don\'t personally know online, and trust
your instincts. If people seem suspicious, stop communicating with
them. [[DOD officials said sextortion often goes unreported]{.mark}
because many victims are embarrassed they fell for it.]{.underline} But
it happens worldwide and across all ranks and services. Here\'s what you
should do about it if it happens to you: Stop communicating with the
scammer. Contact your command and your local CID office. Do NOT pay the
perpetrator. Save all communications you had with that person. Service
Member Impersonation Scams Scammers love to impersonate people of
authority, and that includes service members. These people often steal
the identity or profile images of a service member and use them to ask
for money or make claims that involve the sale of vehicles, house
rentals or other big-ticket items. These scammers often send the victim
bogus information about the advertised product and ask for a wire
transfer through a third party to finish the purchase, but there's no
product at the end of the transaction. [[Lately, fake profiles of
high-ranking American military officials]{.mark} have been popping up
[on social media]{.mark} websites using photos and biographical
information obtained from the internet. Scammers often replicate recent
social media posts from official DOD accounts and interact with official
accounts to increase the appearance of legitimacy.]{.underline} As an

#### Disinformation wrecks NATO decision-making and cohesion and makes a Baltic conflict inevitable -- only a shared consensus on cyber response solves

[During the July 2016 NATO summit, the alliance and the EU issued an
important joint declaration on a new strategic partnership that pledges
to substantially improve cooperation between the two organizations to
bolster alliance defenses against hybrid threats]{.underline}. [[The
Baltic states are the first line of defense against Russian hybrid
measures, yet their vulnerability to Russian unconventional warfare is
the alliance's Achilles' heel]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It remains unclear
whether the Baltic states can make a sustained resource commitment to
closing the many gaps in their defenses against Russia's nonkinetic
tools---such as those in their banking and financial sectors, mass
communications, and domestic and foreign intelligence and law
enforcement. Further, the states may not have the resources to increase
investment in underdeveloped areas with large concentrations of ethnic
Russians. **[The United States]{.mark}** and the EU **[should
boost]{.mark}** funding for the Baltic countries to build [their
capacity to address their most critical vulnerabilities to Russian
hybrid warfare.]{.mark} And NATO and the EU should avoid getting bogged
down in theological and bureaucratic disputes over which organization
should assume primary responsibility for this mission.]{.underline}

ENHANCE NATO PLANNING FOR HYBRID WARFARE

[[Russia's hybrid warfare could pose a serious challenge to NATO's
existing planning and decisionmaking mechanisms. Should Moscow decide to
take actions to undermine Baltic security, it is likely to engage in
disinformation and deception to disguise both military and nonmilitary
moves. NATO could therefore be confronted with ambiguous or uncertain
indications of a possible Russian hybrid attack, creating the potential
for disagreement within NATO councils on when and how the alliance
should respond]{.underline}]{.mark}. [A hasty decision on a forceful
response based on incomplete and ambiguous information may make a crisis
more difficult to manage; by the same token, [a slow decision held
hostage to NATO's consensus-based, decisionmaking procedures could put
Baltic security at risk.]{.mark} NATO decisionmaking could also be
further complicated if one of the Baltic states, in the event of a
provocation by little green men or some other activities in the gray
zone, decides to trigger Article 5 by using lethal force to deal with
the situation.]{.underline}

To deal with these potential dilemmas, [[the alliance needs to reach an
internal consensus on a doctrine]{.underline}]{.mark} that reflects
agreement on the following questions: [What would be the trigger for a
NATO nonkinetic response to Russia's use of hybrid warfare against the
Baltic states? Would the alliance need to respond collectively and
militarily to more aggressive Russian information operations? What would
be the costs and consequences if NATO failed to act under these
circumstances? What if the source of the attack is unclear but is
generally believed to be Russia?]{.underline}

**[[New planning mechanisms need to be established within the alliance
to determine military, operational, and capability requirements to deal
with a range of Russian hybrid warfare
contingencies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, many of these needs fall
outside NATO's core competencies and will therefore require much closer
NATO-EU cooperation, as well as stepped up efforts by the Baltic states.
[The alliance might also have to reevaluate its crisis management and
decisionmaking procedures to ensure that they are structured for quick
and effective responses to Russian activities that are truly hybrid in
nature]{.underline}---in other words, those that combine low-intensity
and high-intensity military moves.

[[We're Focused on Ukraine But Look Out For the **Russian Threat to the
Baltics**]{.underline}]{.mark}: It was a shot heard around the world in
the Russian military analysis community. A RAND Corporation simulated
wargame in 2016 concluded that the Russian military could reach the
suburbs of the Estonian and Latvian capitals of Tallinn and Riga in less
than 60 hours. In the iterations of the exercise, the Estonians and
Latvians would need at least seven brigades of troops that include at
least three armored brigades to potentially fight the Russians to a
standstill.

But it gets worse from here. In another RAND wargame in 2019, the
players examined if NATO and Russia would use tactical nuclear weapons
during a simulated war in the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania). The scenario also had Russian conventional forces
over-running capitals in the Balkans and NATO having the last fail-safe
option to use non-strategic nuclear weapons.

What Type of Warfare Could the Russians Use Against the Baltics?

A widespread fear is that [[the Kremlin could use hybrid
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} (conventional and unconventional aspects of
power projection) [again [to annex parts of the
Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [which would **trigger Article V** with
NATO allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and would require a military response
against the Russians from NATO members. A glance at a map will tell you
that St. Petersburg is dangerously close to Tallinn, Estonia and Riga,
Latvia. But according to General Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the
General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, [the distinctions between
offensive aspects of war and defensive aspects of war are
blurring.]{.underline}

Under this Gerasimov Doctrine, [[the Kremlin then could engineer a
Russian]{.mark} hybrid [incursion]{.mark} of cyber and [**information
warfare attacks** against the Baltics]{.mark}, and [these tactics could
be]{.mark} made to be [seen as a defensive
operation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Since the Baltics have ethnic Russians
as part of the population, [[Moscow could employ special operations
forces]{.mark} as peacekeepers [to protect
compatriots.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[This could happen with an
information warfare campaign that would increase]{.mark} the chances for
[protest]{.mark} and other domestic unrest [with ethnic Russians as
victims]{.mark} in the Baltics. [Then a hybrid operation would ensue to
protect ethnic Russians.]{.mark}]{.underline}

According to the two RAND sets of wargames, [[the Russians would then
bring in the]{.mark} heavy armored and mechanized [infantry]{.mark}
units [to "**teach the Baltics a lesson**."]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Baltic invasion goes [nuclear]{.underline}.

//AShah

Would the US fight a nuclear war to save Estonia? The question would
probably strike most Americans as absurd. Certainly, almost no one was
thinking about such a prospect when NATO expanded to include the Baltic
states back in 2004.

Yet a series of reports by the nonpartisan RAND Corporation shows that
[[the possibility of **nuclear escalation** in a conflict
between]{.mark} the **[N]{.mark}**orth **[A]{.mark}**tlantic
**[T]{.mark}**reaty **[O]{.mark}**rganization [and Russia over the
**Baltic**]{.mark} **region** [is **high**]{.mark}]{.underline}er than
one might imagine. The best way of averting it? Invest more in the
alliance's conventional defense.

There was a time when it seemed quite normal to risk nuclear war over
the sanctity of European frontiers. During the Cold War, NATO was
outnumbered by Warsaw Pact forces, and it would have had great
difficulty stopping a Soviet attack with conventional weapons. [From the
moment it was formed, NATO relied on the threat of nuclear escalation
--- whether rapid and spasmodic, or gradual and controlled --- to
maintain deterrence.]{.underline} American thinkers developed elaborate
models and theories of deterrence. [US and NATO forces regularly carried
out exercises simulating the resort to nuclear weapons to make this
strategy credible.]{.underline}

[After the Cold War ended, the US and its allies had the luxury of
thinking less about nuclear deterrence and war-fighting.]{.underline}
Tensions with Russia receded and nuclear strategy came to seem like a
relic of a bygone era. [Yet today, [with Russia rising again as a
military threat, the]{.mark} grim [logic of **nuclear statecraft is
returning.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The spike in tensions between Russia and the West over the past
half-decade has revealed a basic problem: [[NATO doesn't have the
capability to prevent Russia]{.mark}n forces [from]{.mark} quickly
[overrunning Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Russian invaders would be at the gates of the Baltic capitals in two to
three days; existing NATO forces in the region would be destroyed or
swept aside. NATO could respond by mobilizing for a longer war to
liberate the Baltic countries, but this would require a bloody,
dangerous military campaign. Critically, that campaign would require
striking targets --- such as air defense systems --- located within
Russia itself, as well as suppressing Russian artillery, short-range
missiles and other capabilities within the Kaliningrad enclave, which is
situated behind NATO's front lines.]{.underline}

Moreover, this sort of NATO counteroffensive is precisely the situation
Russian nuclear doctrine seems meant to avert. [[Russian officials
understand that their country would lose a long war against
NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline} They are particularly alarmed at the
possibility of NATO using its unmatched military capabilities to conduct
conventional strikes within Russian borders. So [[the Kremlin has
signaled that it might carry out limited nuclear
strikes]{.underline}]{.mark} --- perhaps a "demonstration strike"
somewhere in the Atlantic, or against NATO forces in the theater ---
[[to force the alliance to make peace]{.mark} on Moscow's
terms.]{.underline} This concept is known as "escalate to de-escalate,"
and there is a growing body of evidence that the Russians are serious
about it.

A [[NATO-Russia war could]{.mark} thus [go nuclear if Russia "escalates"
to preserve the gains it has won early in the conflict.]{.mark} [It
could also go nuclear]{.mark} in a second,]{.underline} if somewhat less
likely, way: [[If the U.S. and NATO initiate their own limited nuclear
strikes against Russian forces to prevent Moscow from overrunning the
Baltic allies in the first place]{.underline}.]{.mark} And even the
limited use of nuclear weapons raises the question of further
escalation: [Would [crossing the nuclear threshold lead]{.mark}, through
deliberate choice or miscalculation, [to a general nuclear war involving
**i**]{.mark}nter**[c]{.mark}**ontinental **[b]{.mark}**allistic
**[m]{.mark}**issile**[s]{.mark}**, strategic bombers and apocalyptic
destruction?]{.underline}

#### (time depending) BUT building on existing NATO counter-disinformation ensures a [stable presence]{.underline} in the Baltics that deters invasion.

the Baltic States?,\"

RMax

NATO plans to have around 3,000 troops in the Baltic states by the end
of May as part of the Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) --- the largest
reinforcement of NATO troops in the region for a generation. This
represents a geopolitical shift of focus for NATO, from its earlier
Central European theatre vis-à-vis the Soviet Union, further eastwards
to the Baltic region vis-à-vis Russia. The aim is to demonstrate the
"strength of the transatlantic bond," reiterating to Russia the message
that an attack on one ally would be considered an attack on the whole
NATO alliance, an alliance which now includes the three ex-Soviet
members of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. These NATO troops will be
joining the US troops deployed there as part of Operation Atlantic
Resolve that the Pentagon claimed demonstrates continued "US commitment
to collective security" in Europe.

[**Strategic communications planning** is **part** of preparing any
military deployment; however]{.underline}, this [deployment could
face]{.underline} the [Kremlin\'s **sophisticated disinformation
operations**]{.underline} and propaganda [in **NATO**
territory]{.underline}. This represents the "geopolitics of
disinformation," currently being tracked by the Centre for European
Policy Analysis (CEPA), who argue that such [Russian "disinformation
has]{.underline} specific geopolitical [objectives]{.underline};" namely
to try [to decrease public support for]{.underline} the **[NATO
deployments]{.underline}** in both the troop-sending states and the host
nation countries.

The [disinformation campaigns]{.underline} waged [by Russia in the
**Baltic region**]{.underline} may [take different forms. NATO **defence
planners**]{.underline} and decisionmakers [need to prepare for **"fake
news"**]{.underline} stories, which report fictional incidents and
opinions. For example, a recent "fake news" story alleged that German
soldiers deployed in Lithuania had raped a teenage girl. A Lithuanian
police investigation determined that the report was false and that the
email from which the story originated was "sent from a country outside
the European Union." Other deceptive reports include: (1) claims that
bad behaviour by allied soldiers deployed in the region has become the
"norm;" (2) reports that allied troops in Latvia would be permitted to
roam the country with loaded weapons; and, (3) allegations that American
soldiers in Latvia have been poisoned with mustard gas that have been
sunk in the Baltic sea, the latter having been published on a Lithuanian
news site after it was hacked. [Specific disinformation was deployed "to
rally]{.underline} the country\'s \[**[Latvia]{.underline}**\'s\]
Russian-speaking minority [**against NATO**." Other methods include
using provocations to create **incidents**]{.underline}, such as the
alleged attempts by a Russian TV crew to pay local youths to riot in
Sweden. Actual incidents may also be used to give them political colour
and portray the allied soldiers as disrespectful of the host Baltic
states, their culture and people, as well as using compromising
information published by the allied soldiers in social media. The risk
of allied troops being provoked in order to discredit the alliance has
also been raised by the head of the Estonian intelligence agency
Estonian Information Board (EIB).

In this regard, [the Baltic states have been **heavily targeted by
Russia** for their eagerness to have allied forces]{.underline} on the
ground and [accused of "plotting an attack on Russia."]{.underline} The
Baltic states are, however, hardened and sensitised to information
attacks, having learnt many lessons from their history of dealing with
Soviet era Kremlin propaganda. Despite Russian disinformation, the
populations of the Baltic states are very supportive of the allied
presence. For example, a Lithuanian poll, carried out in December 2016,
suggested that 81 per cent of respondents supported the permanent
presence of NATO troops in Lithuania. Typical of Russian disinformation
strategy was the rejection of the poll by the website newsbalt.ru (based
in the Russian enclave of Kalingrad), which argued that the poll was
skewed "to please" the Lithuanian Ministry of National Defence.

However, [many of the troop-sending countries are less aware
of]{.underline} the character of the [Kremlin\'s information
warfare]{.underline}. Information warfare is part of the Russian
approach to non-linear warfare that encompasses old and new methods and
tools. One such example is the [Soviet **"reflexive
control"**]{.underline} that [aims to interfere with]{.underline} the
[decisionmaking processes of the adversary through disinformation and
deception]{.underline} and the use of today\'s information technologies
and media, not only in Russian but many other languages. [It also
encompasses **"strategic masking,"** which is spreading disinformation
via media and manipulation of the adversary]{.underline} into believing
reports of military movements. [With the proliferation of
**info**rmation **tech**nologies]{.underline} and the amounts of private
information that people make available online, national governments,
international organisations and societies have become more vulnerable to
information warfare.

[**It is clear** that **NATO** needs to prepare for]{.underline} such
[**disinfo**rmation campaigns]{.underline}. Some of the EFP framework
[nations have **already announced**]{.underline} that [they are
**aware** of the need to deal with these challenges]{.underline}. Most
recently Gen. Jonathan Vance, the Canadian Chief of Defence Staff,
announced that Canada will "take all the precautions" it can and noted
that they "\[...\] have to take on a sophisticated, strategic
communications role so that truth prevails." Gen. Curtis Scaparotti,
NATO\'s Supreme Allied Commander and the Commander of the U.S. European
Command, has also suggested doing more to deal with Russian
disinformation, telling the US Senate Armed Forces Committee that "I
think we\'re focused on it, I don\'t think we\'ve had enough of a
response at this point."

While the varied nature of disinformation warfare complicates
preparation, [NATO could pursue well-designed and holistic
strategic]{.underline} communications [approaches in the Baltic states,
while also recognising the threat of disinformation **beyond the
region**]{.underline}. Countering Russian disinformation requires rapid
investigation of the information and its sources, establishing the facts
and ensuring that the facts reach the same audiences that were targeted
with the disinformation. However, reactive responses alone will likely
be inadequate to deal with the threat. [NATO could be **more proactive**
and shape the information agenda with support]{.underline} and possibly
[led by the host nations. **Soldiers** and]{.underline} their
**[commanders]{.underline}** also [could be **educated** on the
**nuances** of preparing for and **reacting to info**rmation
**war**fare. The Allies might **learn from**]{.underline} Lithuania\'s
"information influence identification and analysis ecosystem (PDF)"
project that monitors and analyses physical and electronic information
environments. Consulting with [the NATO Strategic Communications
(STRATCOM) Centre of Excellence]{.underline}, based in Latvia could also
help, [given its work on Russian **info**]{.underline}rmation [war and
propaganda efforts elsewhere]{.underline} in the region.

In managing disinformation, allies will need therefore to strike the
right balance between combating the disinformation threat and
maintaining secrecy about military details. This balancing act could be
a challenge for NATO and its allies. However, [a **proactive** and
**open communications strategy** could]{.underline} help to ensure that
[disinformation does not impact]{.underline} on [**military operations**
in the Baltic states.]{.underline} Finally, the efforts would likely
need to move beyond a centralised strategic communications messaging
plan and involve each and every soldier, and member of society. This
could demand a higher level of information resilience, especially during
the first months of the deployment.

To conclude, [NATO alliance countries]{.underline} deploying in the
Baltic states [should be prepared to deal with increasing levels of
disinformation]{.underline}, both proactively and reactively. A high
level of preparation, including [an open and robust]{.underline}
communication [strategy, could be crucial in tackling a sophisticated
Russian disinformation campaign aimed to disrupt support for these
deployments]{.underline} in the sending and host nations.

Operating in the shadows of the grey zone that lies between war and
peace[, [Russia's hybrid warfare aims to **undermine**]{.mark}
**targeted [societies and democracies]{.mark}** [through]{.mark} a toxic
mix of [disinformation]{.mark}]{.underline}, cyber-attacks,
transnational repression, economic pressure and the use of both regular
and irregular military force. These [[operations]{.mark} are intended to
support the Putin regime's ultimate objectives: to [**erode Western
alliances**,]{.mark} re-consolidate Russia's Soviet-era regional and
global influence and remain in power as long as possible]{.underline}.
The Russian government's use of non-kinetic strategies and tactics to
advance its interests and gain an advantage over its enemies is not new
and can be traced back to the Soviet era. However, evolving
technologies, shifting media landscapes and the growing emphasis placed
on hybrid warfare in [[Russia]{.mark}'s modern military doctrine
**[represent]{.mark}** a persistent and **[expanding threat to liberal
Western democracies and societies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including
Canada. Vladimir Putin's domestic political authority and legitimacy
rely on his regime's ability to demonstrateand project strength and
control --both domestically and geopolitically. Putin's guiding ambition
has been to reverse what he believes is the "greatest geopolitical
catastrophe" of the 20th century: the collapse of the Soviet Union. The
Kremlin's effort to restore Russia's bygone czarist and Soviet imperial
glory is as much a tactical domestic propaganda operation intended to
support Putin's effort to extend his reign to 2036, as it is meant to
further enrich Russia's corrupt oligarchs and kleptocrats. [What has so
far prevented Putin from fully realizing his goal is a strong and united
transatlantic alliance --one that is committed to deterring Putin's
foreign aggression against allied Western democracies. **[Breaking down
our alliances and the cohesion within them is a critical component of
the Putin regime's strategy]{.mark}** to survive, compete, and when
possible, dominate. [Undermining and subverting the democratic processes
and societies in NATO member states are part of this
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. During his first 21 years in office,
Putin has frequently challenged unity within the transatlantic community
and the commitment to collective defence. Cyber-attacks, influence
operations and [[**information warfare are deployed to destabilize and
undermine democratic processes** and erode Western trust in media,
government and societies]{.mark} in allied nations]{.underline}, and
those like Ukraine and Georgia, which seek to join them.Russia's
invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine
are extreme examples of Russian hybrid warfare. The mixture of
irregularkinetic warfare with information and psychological warfare has
resulted in a grinding, low-intensity conflict that is intended to
perpetually sabotage Ukraine's goal of becoming a full member of the
transatlantic community.

[[As the Russia-Ukraine war intensifies, so too will the flow of
disinformation]{.mark}. This is an age-old strategy Russia has long
history of employing]{.underline}, and a playbook that others, most
notably anti-vaccine activists, have borrowed from liberally. Yet,
rather than focusing effort on convincing people of a falsehood, the
[[Russian strategy]{.mark} takes a tack reminiscent of a strategy long
employed by the tobacco industry: to [**sow so much doubt** about what
is true that it sends people into **decision paralysis**]{.mark}. Faced
with a cacophony of wild and conflicting claims, [people do nothing,
unsure of what is right]{.mark}.]{.underline} Despite constituting only
a small part of our media diet, **[[disinformation campaigns, in our
digital world, can be devastatingly effective]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[We are intrinsically biased towards information that is emotionally
visceral. We afford more weight to content that frightens or outrages
us, with the ability to induce anger serving as the single greatest
predictor of whether content goes viral.]{.underline} This propels the
most visceral, divisive narratives to the forefront of discourse,
creating a sound and fury of passionately debated claims and counter
claims. In that atmosphere[, [it becomes]{.underline}]{.mark}
[increasingly [difficult to ascertain what to believe,]{.mark} and easy
to abandon the task of discerning the truth]{.underline}. If we are not
to fall victim to such rank dishonesty, it is crucial now that we
question our sources more carefully than ever before. [Indecision and
distraction have long been central to Russia's dezinformatsiya
(disinformation) policy, a term Stalin himself is credited with
coining]{.underline}. While an ancient concept, Russia had by the
imperial age mastered dark obfuscation techniques refined for the era of
mass communication. By the dawn of the Soviet empire, they realized this
potential on an industrial scale, establishing the world\'s first office
dedicated to disinformation in 1923. In the 1960s, the KGB covertly
sponsored American fringe groups, amplifying conspiratorial narratives
about everything from the assassination of president John F. Kennedy to
water fluoridation. The goal, as KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin
elucidated in 1998, was "not intelligence collection, but subversion:
[[active measures to weaken the West, **to drive wedges**]{.mark} in the
Western community alliances of all sorts, particularly [NATO, to sow
discord among allies]{.mark}, to weaken the United States in the eyes of
the people of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America]{.underline}\....".
Operation INFEKTION, a mid-1980s clandestine effort to spread the myth
that AIDS was a CIA-designed bioweapon, was but one infamous exemplar.
While utterly fictious, it resonated with communities ravaged by HIV and
neglected by the callous indifference of the Reagan administration.
Despite Russian intelligence taking responsibility for this lie in 1992,
the legacy of AIDS denialism persists to this day worldwide.

[Less than two weeks [before pivotal elections for the European

spreading disinformation]{.mark}]{.underline}, encouraging discord and
[[amplifying distrust]{.mark} in the centrist parties that have governed

advocacy groups say the new [disinformation efforts share many of the
same digital fingerprints or tactics used in previous Russian
attacks]{.underline}, including the Kremlin's interference in the 2016
U.S. presidential campaign. Fringe political commentary sites in Italy,
for instance, bear the same electronic signatures as pro-Kremlin
websites, while a pair of German political groups share servers used by
the Russian hackers who attacked the Democratic National Committee. The
activity offers fresh evidence that despite indictments, expulsions and

will be held between May 23 and May 26, are regarded as a test of
[[rising populism in the E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion]{.underline}.
[[Populist leaders]{.mark}, many of them [sympathetic to Russia]{.mark},
have loosely [joined together in hopes of expanding their influence in

have not publicly accused the Kremlin of backing specific candidates in
Europe in the way that American authorities say that President Vladimir
V. Putin sought to promote Donald J. Trump in 2016. But Mr.
[[Putin]{.mark} has long sought to divide the European Union, and has
[supported populist movements]{.mark} that seek [to undermine]{.mark}
the bloc from within.]{.underline} It is nearly impossible to quantify
the scale and resonance of the misinformation. [Researchers say millions
of people see the material.]{.underline} Investigators have found
hundreds of Facebook and Twitter accounts, more than a thousand examples
of WhatsApp messages sharing suspicious materials, and a hodgepodge of
dodgy websites that launder varying degrees of misinformation ---
whether conspiracy theories or polarized slants on the news. A
longstanding debate has been whether this material changes behavior or
votes, especially as tech companies have worked to stamp it out. But
security researchers suggest that swinging elections is a stretch goal
for this kind of campaign, if that. The [primary [point is to]{.mark}
muddle the conversation, [make people question what is true]{.mark},
[and erode trust]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia dismisses accusations of
meddling. "The election has yet to come, and we are already suspected of
doing something wrong?" the Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev,
said in March. "Suspecting someone of an event that has not yet happened
is a bunch of paranoid nonsense." Distinguishing Russian interference
from clickbait or sincere political outrage is difficult, even for
intelligence services. The digital trail often winds up in one of the
internet's anonymized dead ends. But [pro-Russian fingerprints
exist]{.underline}.

#### Democratic backsliding from Russia's influence campaign is weaking NATO \-\-- allows Russia to exploit the weaknesses and further undermine the coherence of the alliance

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}) is
[[facing an internal problem that coauld permanently weaken the
Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}. In recent years, we have seen the rise of
a nationalist-populist wave in Europe and the United States: Viktor
Orbán of Hungary, the Kaczynski in Poland, and President Donald Trump in
America. This [rise in illiberal world leaders has led to [significant
democratic backsliding]{.mark} in NATO countries]{.underline}, **[which
pose a [grave threat to NATO's strength in the face of an aggressive and
revisionist Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Democratic
governance]{.underline} and strong institutions [are]{.underline} as
much a [cornerstone of the Alliance]{.underline} as is collective
defense. Article II of the North Atlantic Treaty (also known as the
Washington Treaty) stresses the importance of "states' promises to
strengthen free institutions within their borders," underscoring the
vital democratic aspects of the alliance. Within NATO today, however,
[some states are shifting away from]{.underline} the [core tenets of
Article II]{.underline} and are actively conspiring to undermine the
same institutional channels that brought them to power. These
[[regressions of democracy create vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}
that **[[can be exploited by NATO adversaries, namely the
Kremlin]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In [Hungary]{.underline}, Orbán's
[increasingly authoritarian Fidesz government]{.underline} has taken an
increasingly pro-Russia stance, doling out energy contracts to the
country's oligarchs [and calling for Hungary to model itself a similarly
to Russia's illiberal state]{.underline}. In [Turkey]{.underline}, the
[rise of Recep Tayyip Erdogan]{.underline} has [resulted in members of
the military being sacked and indiscriminate jailing of journalists and
academics]{.underline}, while leaving no real opposition to his rule.
This in turn has led to closer ties between Ankara and Moscow,
especially in matters of defense and the ongoing Syrian civil war.
[Poland continues to see Russia as both an adversary]{.underline} and a
threat; however, Poland's judiciary reform has effectively turned the
high court into a PiS puppet while media repression has simultaneously
turned Poland into both a victim and purveyor of disinformation
campaigns, further isolating it from its allies and European partners.
**[[Democratic backsliding]{.mark} and increased illiberal leaders in
NATO countries]{.underline}** have **[[opened the door for Russia to
engage in an influence campaign]{.mark}, and to [pull those countries
away from the L]{.mark}iberal [W]{.mark}estern
[O]{.mark}rder]{.underline}** the Alliance is founded on. **[Democratic
[backsliding weakens NATO internally by making cohesion, trust, and
operations more difficult]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Democracies tend to
foster cooperation and trust; autocracies are always looking to blame
"the other." Within NATO, we are seeing bigger wedges being driven into
member states, as illiberal regimes criticize their democratic allies,
and democracies sanction authoritarian actions. Germany and the EU have
become targets of the right-wing populist Prawo i Sprawiedliwość
(PiS/Law and Justice) government in Poland. The current government has
sought to expunge any guilt the "Polish Nation" incurred during the
Second World War by engaging in an aggressive revisionist campaign aimed
at denying Poland's participation in Nazi death camps. Furthermore,
Poland's attempt to sack its Constitutional Court and replace 27
justices with PiS loyalists has alienated it from France, Germany, and
the European Commission, which opened an Article 7 investigation last
year into Poland's actions and is currently threatening to take legal
action against it. Likewise, Hungary has taken an antagonistic stance
with EU members and their efforts to promote rule of law. Budapest has
been in an entrenched battle against the EU, in what Orbán has called
"liberal forces acting against Central and Eastern European countries,"
while actively opposing and restraining EU laws on immigration,
entertaining anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, and curtailing individual
freedoms within Hungary's borders. The [right-wing populism]{.underline}
of both Poland and Hungary, with their villainization of minorities,
[suppression of dissent, crackdown on civil society, and erosion of
democratic norms]{.underline} and institutions, puts them at odds with
their NATO allies and EU partners, [fostering uncertainty and deep
mistrust among them]{.underline}. [Poland and Hungary are not the only
NATO members breaking down trust]{.underline}. [[Traditional allies have
taken an unprecedented stance on NATO, one which brings its members
uncertainty and lack of trust]{.mark}.]{.underline} [President Donald
Trump has been a]{.underline} vociferous [critic of the
Alliance]{.underline}, admonishing members for failing to spend 2
percent of their GDP on defense while frequently highlighting the
"lion's share" the United States contributes. Trump has gone to the
extent of questioning the alliance itself, asking, "What good is
NATO...?" in a tweet. Apart from voicing criticism against NATO, Trump
has repeatedly insulted NATO members and their leaders, while directing
attention to closer relations with Russia, even though there have not
been any significant changes in the Kremlin's commitment to democracy,
rule of law, or its meddling in internal processes of other nations.
Russia continues to be a U.S. and NATO adversary. [These stances from
the current U.S. administration [encourage anti-EU and anti-NATO
rhetoric]{.mark} from other leaders, while at the same time [erodes
trust among its members and **ultimately plays into the Kremlin's
intentions to**]{.mark} **destabilize the West and [undermine the
Alliance]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

institutions]{.underline}. The [rise of nationalist populists in

Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, [[shatters the]{.underline}

powers]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[complicates attempts to heal rifts in

populists or to balance their influence in multilateral institutions
seem to have had limited success. A sustainable strategy to deal with
the challenge posed by populists would need to start by recognizing that
we can no longer assume that nuclear weapons are safe in the hands of
some states but not in others'. Introduction The rise of nationalist
populists1 to power in nuclear-armed states and their allies is
undermining the nuclear order and raising the risks of nuclear war. That
populists such as Boris Johnson, Narendra Modi, Vladimir Putin, and
Donald Trump were able to take charge of nuclear arsenals, including in
some of the nuclear powers recognized under the 1968 Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), challenges the assumption
that established nuclear-weapon states behave responsibly. [Nationalist
populism]{.underline},2 understood as a nationalist, anti-elitist,
illiberal, and anti-pluralist set of ideas and politics conducted in the
supposed interests of "the people"---that is, the domestic
constituencies of the nationalist-populist leaders---has been on the
rise globally since the mid-2000s. It has come to include the leadership
of a growing number of countries3 and [has begun to influence the
effectiveness of time-honored institutions of the nuclear
order]{.underline}. We argue that this rise of nationalist populists and
their foreign and defense policies weakens the nuclear order in novel,
significant, and persistent ways. Three [characteristics]{.underline}
are [typical of nationalist populists' nuclear policies]{.underline}:
they talk differently about nuclear weapons; they have [a specific way
of getting involved in national decision making on nuclear-weapon
issues]{.underline}; and their approach to international alliances and
institutions is unique. The fact that [nationalist-populist leaders have
assumed control over nuclear weapons in countries]{.underline} at the
core of the nuclear order [[shatters the presumed distinction between
"responsible" and "irresponsible" nuclear powers]{.underline}]{.mark}.
These leaders threaten the nuclear order built on the principled
acceptance of a logic of restraint by the nuclear-weapon states.
Although it highlights the risks associated with populists' control over
nuclear weapons, this article does not aspire to a radical critique of
the nuclear order.4 Our aim is to show that the rise of populists to the
centers of power in nuclear-armed states challenges prevailing
presumptions about nuclear risks and how they are to be managed. The
view that a few responsible nuclear-armed states guard against
irresponsible behavior by states mostly peripheral to the nuclear order
is no longer defensible, if it ever was. **[[Nationalist
populists]{.mark}]{.underline}** thus starkly **[[expose the dangers
intrinsically linked to nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
regardless of regime type and the position of nuclear-weapon possessors
in the international system. We understand nationalist populists to be
leaders who claim to implement policies to defend the interests of their
constituencies, which they brand as "the people," against supposed
foreign and internal elites in order to bolster national sovereignty.
Nationalist-populist leaders who had or have nuclear weapons under their
control include former US President Donald Trump, British Prime Minister
Boris Johnson, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Russian
President Vladimir Putin.5 We concentrate our analysis on these four
nationalist-populist leaders, who have shaped foreign and defense
policies---and particularly nuclear-weapon policies---in key
nuclear-possessor states.6 The 2016 election of Donald Trump, a populist
by any measure, is of particular significance, since the United States
has consistently been the state with the largest ability to uphold and
strengthen the institutions and practices that underpin the nuclear
order. Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Prime
Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan are also nationalist populists. Israel,
however, has a policy of nuclear opacity, under which it does not
acknowledge possession of nuclear weapons.7 This made it impossible for
Netanyahu to openly use nuclear weapons as a policy instrument in the
same manner as other populists do. In Pakistan, the civilian leadership
has only limited influence over nuclear-weapon policies because nuclear
command and control rests with the armed forces.8 Chinese President Xi
Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are also often described as
populists.9 Both leaders frequently use nationalist rhetoric, which
resembles the populists' style. However, we do not classify either as a
nationalist populist because they do not rely on an internal in-group
versus out-group dichotomy to justify their leadership. In autocratic
regimes, such as those in China and North Korea, the leader holds
absolute power and does not need to appeal to popular sovereignty or to
employ other populist strategies. In France, the Front National, now
Rassemblement National, is an influential nationalist-populist movement.
Opposition leader Marine Le Pen has promised to "restore the full
meaning of the 'force de frappe'" and reinvigorate national sovereignty
through nuclear deterrence.10 A populist turn in French nuclear policies
therefore remains a distinct possibility. In two of the five nations
that host US nuclear weapons under NATO nuclear-sharing arrangements,
populists are in power (Turkey) or part of a government (Italy). In a
third host nation, Belgium, a right-wing populist party has very
recently been part of the government. In Germany, until the September
2021 parliamentary elections, a right-wing populist party was the
strongest parliamentary opposition party.11 While populism, and
particularly nationalist populism, has been on the rise in nuclear-armed
states, three major developments in the background have reshaped the
nuclear order. We understand this order to be characterized by the
continuous search for accommodation between the goals of nuclear
disarmament, on the one hand, and stability based on nuclear-deterrence
relationships, on the other hand, through a policy of restraint and
responsible behavior, particularly by the five nuclear-weapon states
recognized under the NPT.12 [First, a [more multipolar logic has begun
to replace the primarily bipolar Cold War nuclear structure]{.mark}. In
particular, the rise of [new challengers to US hegemony has produced new
power constellations]{.mark}.13 Second, [new actors]{.mark}, including
transnational non-state groups, are [challenging the predominance of
governments and pose new threats]{.mark}, particularly if those actors
strive to acquire weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}. Third, the
[emergence of new military technologies has weakened strategic
stability]{.underline}. For example, the entanglement of novel
conventional and nuclear warfighting capabilities threatens to
destabilize long-standing mutual-deterrence relationships, particularly
between Russia and the United States, on the one hand, and between China
and the United States, on the other hand.14 All [three
d[evelopments]{.mark}, and the interrelations among them, already [are
increasing nuclear dangers and unsettling the existing
nuclear-deterrence relationships]{.mark}]{.underline}. The rise of
nationalist populism and populists to power is a recent fourth
development that adds to and amplifies these risks. Our examination of
the impact of the rise of nationalist populism on the nuclear order
meshes with the attention given in academic literature to the role of
individuals in nuclear policies. The recent shift toward the first image
(that is, the analysis of international relations focusing on the impact
of individual leaders as opposed to an analysis at the level of states
or the international system)15 is associated with an investigation of
how the perceptions and preferences of specific personality types have
altered national nuclear policies and the nuclear order. We add to this
literature by considering a specific type of leader, the nationalist
populist, and his (rarely her) influence on nuclear issues. The role of
populism in foreign and defense policy, and particularly on nuclear
policies, is seldom treated as a distinct phenomenon. This research gap
has not been filled by issue-, country-, or region-specific
investigations of the causes and effects of populism, which are more
interested in how individual leaders have addressed particular issues
than in the broad implications of the rise of nationalist populism.16
Our conception of nationalist populism overlaps with Jacques Hymans's
description of the "oppositional nationalist."17 Hymans makes a
convincing case that this type of leader has a particular affinity for
nuclear weapons. However, where Hymans is interested in how leadership
traits influence the decision to acquire nuclear weapons, we focus on
policies affecting established nuclear arsenals. There is also a
difference in framing between our idea of nationalist populism and
Hymans's notion of national-identity conceptions. The concept of
"nation" is central to both frames. Yet populists equate the nation with
their core domestic constituencies (and perhaps their own selves), while
oppositional nationalists mostly view the nation-state as an entity in
relation to other nations. Both view politics as the manifestation of an
us-versus-them struggle. But nationalist populists and oppositional
nationalists have different notions of the "us" (the people/nation) and
different concepts of "them" (elites, other people/other nations).18 In
our analysis, the Trump administration receives more attention than
other nationalist-populist leaderships. This imbalance reflects the
extraordinary amount of writing on an atypical US president. A focus on
Trump is justified, since the United States remains the most important
actor in the nuclear order. Also, Trump is often described as a
prototypical populist19 who has inspired others to follow his lead and
has generally increased the impact of populists in other countries. With
Trump now out of office, this is a good time to take stock of his
administration's impact on the nuclear order: "Trump's presidency
offers, for good or ill, an excellent laboratory to examine whether and
to what extent the assumption of government power by populists
translates into foreign policy change."20 We also consider the roles of
other nationalist-populist leaders within the nuclear order and offer
some observations on the implications of the rise of this phenomenon for
nuclear disarmament, arms control, and nonproliferation. We hope to
provide a number of **[tentative arguments and conclusions about the
[distinct, dangerous, and often strange ways that populists are shaping
the nuclear order]{.mark}. Populist foreign and defense policy To
examine the influence of populism on foreign and defense
policy]{.underline}**, the idea of populism itself requires definition,
or at least approximation. Populism is a fuzzy concept. At the most
basic level, populists present themselves as atypical leaders from
outside the establishment. Populists like to tell a story of how they
are virtually predestined to represent and empower a silent and
politically neglected majority (which they label as "the people"). But
populism is neither a full-fledged political ideology nor simply a
political or rhetorical style. It is rather a "thin-centered
ideology."21 Populism is inherently difficult to pin down, since
populists want to maintain maximum flexibility to apply their ideas to,
or combine them with, other ideologies---right, left, or drawing upon
both---regardless of the underlying political system. The notion of a
populist foreign and defense policy is equally hard to delineate.
Leaders' foreign policies reflect their personal characteristics and
political behavior, how they interpret the world and their role in it,
how they make decisions, and how they interact with others.22 As Daniel
Byman and Kenneth Pollack state, "It is individuals who build the
alliances, and create the threats that maintain or destroy balances of
power."23 Populist leadership is especially personalistic; a populist
leader's beliefs and decisions can be assumed to be more influential in
shaping foreign and defense policies than those of other leaders.
Nationalism, as one of the possible host ideologies of populism, adds
another layer. [Nationalist and populist discourses
overlap]{.underline}; what the nation is to the nationalist, "the
people" is to the populist. The concepts of sovereignty and
self-determination drive both discourses, but they affect foreign and
defense policies through different mechanisms. In principle, there is a
clear delineation between a given nation and all other nations. The
populists' idea of "the people" is vaguer. Populists use this ambiguous
construct to evoke a group (their "base") within a polity, juxtaposing
it with "elites" at the top. According to populists, these elites are
outside the group of the "real" or "true" people. Populist politicians
boast about not being part of the elite class (a claim that is rarely
true, in economic or educational terms) and thus claim to speak and act
in the name of the people from within their ranks, implying that only
they can genuinely represent them.24 Nationalist populists not only
claim to speak for "the people" but also presume to define the nation.
They fuse inward-looking populist discourse with a more outward-oriented
nationalist ideology. This shift in the frame of reference portrays the
elites as depriving the people of their sovereignty both at home and
abroad.25 As Jordan Kyle and Brett Meyer put it, "foreign policy is
often collateral damage of populists' divisive approach to domestic
politics."26 We identify the following characteristics of external
policies pursued by nationalist populist leaderships: Polarization. "Us
versus them" is the predominant discourse. Restraint, empathy, and
compromise are anathema.27 Romanticizing of the historical past.
Populists want to [revive the "national missions" of their own
countries.28 Personalistic leadership.]{.underline} Political authority
rests primarily with a single person, often the head of a movement,29
rather than within structures and institutions. Foreign and defense
policies are extensions of domestic policy debates. The leader's
political messaging is direct, with "the people," often via social or
new media, while ignoring established channels of interaction with the
broader public.30 National sovereignty. Populists view alliances and
international institutions as constraining the freedom of
nation-states.31 The short-term, narrow interest of the nation is the
sole yardstick of success.32 Iconoclasm. Populists want to dismantle
international organizations, which they view as the instruments of
circles of elites who support international cooperation and integration.
They reject cultural and economic globalization and free trade.33 These
criteria do not represent a comprehensive account of the
nationalist-populist phenomenon, and the checklist is not exhaustive.
Some of these traits could also apply to non-populist foreign and
defense policies. Nevertheless, taken together, these features of the
nationalist-populist approach to international policy issues capture a
unique, identifiable phenomenon: if a leader walks like a populist,
talks like a populist, and acts like a populist, then he or she most
likely is a populist (see Figure 1). Here to stay: the proliferation of
populism The rise of nationalist populists to power in nuclear-weapon
states is a phenomenon worthy of in-depth analysis for three reasons.
First, the development is of an unprecedented scale globally. A recent
overview found that there are "**[[more populist leaders and parties in
power than at almost any time in history]{.mark}.]{.underline}**"34
Individuals and their beliefs and preferences, along with external
systemic factors, shape foreign-policy decisions and interactions among
states. However, how and to what degree populists influence nuclear
policies varies between countries. [[Populists have risen to power in
democracies]{.mark}, electoral autocracies,35 and other hybrid
regimes]{.underline}. Depending on the political system, their influence
may be constrained by other branches of government and by actors, such
as private companies, whose interests may be inconsistent with a
populist agenda. Generally speaking, the individual leader has the
greatest influence on a state's decisions and behavior in personalistic
systems. By contrast, the checks and balances of pluralistic systems
often constrain democratically elected leaders. Even there, however,
**[na[tionalist populists increase their influence by constantly
chipping away at]{.mark} the core values, principles, and procedures [of
liberal democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as separation of powers,
rule of law, political representation, and individual rights and
freedoms.36 Second, **[nationalist [populists have risen to power in
three of the five]{.mark}]{.underline}** nuclear-weapon states. The
significance of that development for the nuclear order is particularly
great, since these five **[[states bear a special responsibility for
maintaining]{.mark} and improving that order and [international
peace]{.mark} generally]{.underline}**.37 In their parallel role as the
five permanent members of the UN Security Council, their consent is
necessary for enforcement of compliance with the NPT and other
multilateral regimes. Their [willingness to forgo nuclear, biological,
and chemical weapons, or their lack of willingness, sets examples for
other, less influential states]{.underline}. In the past, Western
leaders often dismissed populism as a problem of less developed
countries.38 At the same time, nuclear establishments saw the peace
movement and other grassroots movements as populist---that is, non-elite
groups that were challenging elitist policies supposedly based on
rationality and stability.39 To be sure, the time for finger pointing is
over. "Populism has not just risen in emerging democracies with weaker
political parties and institutions but in systemically important
democracies with long institutional histories like the United States and
India," as Kyle and Meyer observe.40 Few if any states now appear to be
immune to populist challenges. Consequently, the assumption that the
established nuclear-weapon states can protect the nuclear order from
less responsible challengers must be revised. Third, populism is here to
stay. To be sure, populism is not a new phenomenon, and populists have
challenged the nuclear order before in various ways.41 Today's populism,
additionally, is fueled by the perceived inability of states and
institutions to attend to the political, economic, and cultural
consequences of the global economic crisis of 2008, as well as the
increase in xenophobia following the increase in conflict-induced flight
and migration into Europe since 2015.42 In the context of "crises of
political representation engendered by dislocations caused by
globalization and other shifts in international politics" and as a
"reaction to concurrent political and economic crises in a rapidly
denationalized and deterritorialized world,"43 the rise of populism has
been a reaction to perceived insecurity, inequality, depoliticization,
and economic stagnation. As a result, a rise of illiberalism and a wave
of autocratization can be observed.44 [**Nationalist populists have come
to power in the shadow of** the crisis of the **liberal international
order**, benefiting from the crisis and perpetuating it.]{.underline}
The impact of nationalist populism is going to stay with us, likely
beyond the lifetime of individual nationalist-populist governments. That
is partly because the leaders have begun to paralyze, reshape, and
dismantle existing bureaucracies. Nationalist populists define
themselves as being anti-elitist (even if they themselves are members of
the elite). Once they occupy the seats of power, national populists
co-opt, exchange, or sideline old elites. The resulting reshuffle in the
foreign and defense apparatuses sometimes resembles a purge and can lead
to dramatic discontinuities in expertise. It will take time to repair
the damage done to governance structures and to heal the wounds caused
by political polarization. In the nuclear world, this destabilization of
institutions is particularly significant. The [[nationalist-populist
assault weakens]{.mark} the [influence of those who are supposed to act
as "guardians of the arsenals]{.mark}."]{.underline} The influence of
nationalist-populist leaders on nuclear-weapon policies also has
grown.45 [When it comes to nuclear-weapon use, the dangers posed by
nationalist populists are stark because in most nuclear-weapon states
the head of state or government has the legal authority to order the use
of nuclear weapons.]{.underline} [But]{.underline} there are different
shades of gray. [In nuclear-armed states with presidential
systems]{.underline} (France, Russia, and the United States), [launch
authority "clearly rests in the hands of one single
person,"]{.underline} while in those with parliamentary systems (India,
Israel, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom), "the decision to launch a
nuclear strike would necessarily not be the sole authority of one
individual, even if it is 'legally' (i.e. on paper)."46 Three ways
populists change the nuclear order Against this background of the
characteristics of populists' foreign and defense policies and the
diffusion of populism into nuclear powers' decision-making centers, we
describe three relevant causal mechanisms through which nationalist
populists influence the nuclear order. First, [nationalist populists
have a different way of speaking.]{.underline} "\[T\]he specific style
of rhetoric used by the populists involves adversarial, emotional,
patriotic, and abrasive speech through which they connect with the
discontented often via grassroots, community-oriented, communicative
practices and spaces."47 [For]{.underline} nationalist
[populists]{.underline}, the [domestic audience is the most important
recipient of any messaging]{.underline}; everything is said with a
[communicative purpose to please "the people,]{.underline}" to secure
their approval and votes and therefore to retain power. Second,
nationalist [populists have a particular way of making
decisions]{.underline}, sometimes reflective of the fact that
delineating "the people" from an "elite" is a constitutive element of
populism. Whereas usually a small and closed group of experts and
officials prepares and executes decisions in foreign and defense policy,
the policy style of nationalist populists is a peculiar mix of
laissez-faire on routine issues and very visible leadership when the
stakes are high. As Kyle and Gultchin argue, populists seek to convince
their supporters that they "see and acknowledge the crisis and that
their strong leadership alone can fix it."48 Third, [nationalist
[populists]{.mark} have a distinct perspective on the international
order]{.underline}. They [[view the world through a "great-power"
lens]{.mark} that is [consistent with]{.mark} the ["realist"
logic]{.mark} of foreign and defense policy.]{.underline} At the same
time, nationalist populists reject the notion of an international order
based on and shaped by bilateral and multilateral agreements and
treaties. This is partly because the rise of nationalist populism "has
brought a new persona to the global stage---the iconoclast. This
deliberate rule breaker disrupts the practice of international
relations, a system that depends upon consensus around norms."49 Talking
about nuclear weapons As Alexey Arbatov has observed, "when it comes to
nuclear weapons, words are deeds."50 This is because nuclear weapons
have been exploded in war only twice. All other "uses" of nuclear
weapons have been limited to verbal actions, policy documents,
deployment, testing, and other actions short of direct hostile use.51
[Usually, nuclear messaging is the outcome of a careful and deliberate
process.]{.underline} For example, heads of state or government
typically speak about nuclear arsenals and nuclear strategy on the basis
of carefully scripted and meticulously reviewed statements. Exegesis of
nuclear-policy documents and speeches is the preoccupation of many
nuclear analysts, based on the assumption that, especially in the
nuclear world, leaders and officials have thoroughly weighed and
consciously selected their words. [Nationalist [populists, by contrast,
often speak loosely about nuclear weapons]{.mark}, which complicates a
"reading" of their statements.52 This concerns both style and substance,
which coincide with their personalistic style of leadership53 and their
desire to [flout the rules of what they deride as "political
correctness]{.mark}."]{.underline}54 Donald Trump has again led the
way---for example, through his excessive tweeting on nuclear-weapon
issues.55 Other nationalist populists have also deviated from previous
rhetorical styles by bragging about their nuclear weapons. In April
2019, shortly after an escalation of the Pulwama crisis between India
and Pakistan had been averted, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi
suggested that his country was ready to use nuclear weapons against
Pakistan: "Every other day they used to say 'we have nuclear button, we
have nuclear button'. What do we have then? Have we kept it for
Diwali?"56 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's October 2019 statement that
it is unacceptable for Turkey not to have nuclear weapons because
"\[t\]here is no developed nation in the world that doesn't have them"57
is another typically populist statement, conflating strong views with
half-truths or lies. Such loose talk may have several purposes. By
emphasizing nuclear weapons, nationalist populists can set themselves
apart from the established elite discourse. Donald Trump boasted of
having gained knowledge of nuclear weapons not through a formal
education but through his uncle, a professor of engineering at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.58 Thus, the US president believed
that he did not need to rely on the expertise and experience of the
nuclear elite. This ignorance of nuclear lessons by virtue of not "being
socialized to the dangers of nuclear weapons"59 derived from the past is
a trademark of nationalist populists, but is also part and parcel of a
general loss of expertise in executives and parliaments in
nuclear-weapon states and nuclear-allied countries.60 Nationalist
populists also like to make strong statements on nuclear issues because
they may believe that this impresses their main target audience---that
is, their domestic power base. Thus, [[Putin has several times
used]{.mark} his regular direct encounters with the Russian public to
highlight the [importance of nuclear weapons for Moscow's standing in
the world.]{.mark}]{.underline} In March 2018, Putin, in his speech to
the Federal Assembly of Parliamentarians, policy makers, religious
leaders, public figures, and members of the media, boasted about
Russia's nuclear capabilities and in true populist fashion even invited
"\[t\]hose interested in military equipment ... to suggest a name for
this new weaponry, this cutting-edge" nuclear-weapon system.61 And Modi
made repeated reference to India's nuclear weapons during the 2019
parliamentary election campaign. As one analyst observed, "The context
of Modi's remarks on nuclear weapons---election rallies---matter\[s\],
of course. With a poor economic track record since 2014, the \[Bharatiya
Janata Party\] has rightly decided to focus on what much of the Indian
public perceives as a strength: its management of national security and
defense."62 In a similar vein, nationalist populists may bring religious
motives into the nuclear discourse. Thus, Putin seems to believe that
"Orthodoxy and the nuclear deterrent are equally important bulwarks of
Russian statehood, guaranteeing the nation's security internally, in the
case of the church, and externally, in the case of the nuclear
arsenal."63 Talking about nuclear weapons primarily in order to impress
the domestic power base---rather than external actors---can increase
nuclear risks in various ways. Nationalist populists tend to trivialize
nuclear risks while exaggerating the benefits of having nuclear weapons.
This idealization of nuclear weapons can break down (verbal) barriers
and incentivize other states to pursue nuclear weapons. The mixing of
domestic and external audiences also may make it more difficult for
third parties to judge the intentions behind strong statements. When
Trump says that he wants to unleash "fire and fury" on North Korea, to
whom is he talking?64 External observers may believe that signals are
intended for domestic consumption---but they cannot be sure. Populist
decision making on nuclear weapons In most nuclear-weapon states and
under normal conditions, a small group of experts prepares decisions on
the direction of nuclear-weapon policies.65 Routine nuclear policy
making often remains remarkably unaffected by changes in political
leadership. Secrecy and path dependencies complicate any precise
analysis of the impact of the rise of nationalist populism on routine
policy making. But a few tentative observations can be offered. Routine
decision making on nuclear-weapon-related issues appears to remain
mostly below the radar of most nationalist populists in power. The long,
deliberative processes behind nuclear-weapon policies do not lead to the
quick payoffs in public attention that nationalist populist leaders
typically seek. From the perspective of the guardians of the
arsenal---the group of "initiated" experts with relevant security
clearances---there is little reason to change that. If and when
nationalist populists get involved in policy making, their instincts
usually favor greater reliance on nuclear weapons. But their unruly
approach to politics is not very compatible with the inertia-driven
approach of the nuclear establishment. Thus, at a briefing for him at
the Defense Department on July 20, 2017, Trump reportedly asked why he
didn't have as many weapons as past presidents did, pointing out that
the United States at the height of Cold War had had more than 30,000
nuclear weapons, as opposed to "only" a few thousand by 2017.66
[[Nationalist populists' disinterest in and absence from routine policy
making may empower officials with radical views.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Nuclear doctrines are a case in point. Thus, the February 2018 US
Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) changed the trajectory of US nuclear-weapon
policies by introducing new types of nuclear weapons. The NPR widened
the scenarios under which nuclear weapons might be used, blurred
boundaries between conventional and nuclear scenarios of warfighting,
lowered the threshold for nuclear-weapon use, and shifted
nuclear-weapon-deployment scenarios in the direction of warfare---that
is, away from the idea that the only legitimate use of nuclear weapons
is to deter existential threats.67 But "Trump had nothing to do with the
\[NPR\]; it was written almost entirely inside the Pentagon, as previous
reviews had been, with still less direction or input than usual from the
White House," as Fred Kaplan observed.68 So the changes can be explained
partly by the "resurgence of the nuclear establishment" and its
"convergence" with the rise of Trump.69 A similar hands-off attitude may
explain the rash nuclear threats that Russian diplomats have issued
against third countries. Such bullying appears to be possible only
because the Kremlin provides the political space for it by justifying
aggressive postures (and annexations) in nationalist terms.70 Thus, the
hands-off approach of nationalist-populist leaders to routine issues can
also have a disruptive effect on nuclear policies. While the outcome may
resemble the policies of hawkish conservatives, the policy process
leading to the outcome is markedly different. This difference is
relevant to the effect of such policies: nationalist populists' neglect
of detail and their ignorance of strategy can make it harder for others
to assess the significance of policy changes and associated messages.
Thus, bringing the nationalist populists into decision making on nuclear
policy also runs the risk of their instincts ruining and counteracting
the results of previous policy making, again adding a degree of
unpredictability. A prime example is the January 2019 US Missile Defense
Review. The document itself is the product of a multi-year interagency
process. One of the key questions was whether the review should revise
US and NATO policies so that they would direct missile defenses against
the threat of Russian long-range missiles. The potential use of Western
missile defenses in that way is a central factor influencing Russian
nuclear policies. The review itself did not result in such a change of
policy.71 President Trump, however, presenting the review results at a
January 17, 2019, press conference, contradicted US policy by stating,
"Our strategy is grounded in one overriding objective: to detect and
destroy every type of missile attack against any American target,
whether before or after launch. When it comes to defending America, we
will not take any chances. We will only take action. There is no
substitute for American military might."72 Predictably, Russia seized on
the contradictions between policies coming out of the bureaucracy and
statements by the president to argue that the Trump administration was
seeking to attain military dominance and justify its own expansion of
nuclear capabilities.73 Nationalist-populist grandstanding thus can have
the indirect effect of paving the way for competitors to react by
increasing their own nuclear capabilities. The **[[impact of]{.mark}
nationalist-[populist decision making and "instincts" during nuclear
crises is a particular cause for concern]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Nationalist populists by nature tend to be risk takers, and their
mistrust of their own nuclear establishments---which tend to be risk
averse---may facilitate dangerous moves. Putin's statements after the
annexation of Crimea that Russia "was ready" to put nuclear forces on
alert is an indication of his willingness to raise the stakes.74
Erdogan's decision to cut off power to Incirlik Air Base, where about 50
US nuclear weapons are deployed, during the 2016 coup attempt against
him is another example of ignorance of nuclear dangers during a crisis.

importance of securing the domestic power base overrides all other
concerns about nuclear security]{.mark}.]{.underline}**75

## \*\*ISIS\*\*

### 2AC ISIS Add-On

#### ISIS uses misinformation to drive recruitment of home-based fighters that increase the prevalence and frequency of attacks

Bruno **Lete**, senior fellow at The German Marshall Fund of the United
States in Brussels, **2022**, "Stopping ISIS from Luring People into
Terrorism", GMFUS, [https://www.gmfus.org/download/article/15697
//](https://www.gmfus.org/download/article/15697%20//) \[AWV\]

[The self-proclaimed Islamic State group has revolutionized the way
terrorist organizations recruit people]{.underline}. Where in the past
jihadist groups would spend months approaching, evaluating, and
radicalizing potential recruits, [ISIS succeeded to combine
old-fashioned ways of communication, internet-based technologies, and an
understanding of the global audience to accelerate a very effective
pattern of support]{.underline}. Indeed, it should not only be the broad
extent of their reach that should worry us, but also the speed at which
they are able to recruit new fighters.

But why would a person feel excited by the things ISIS is doing? Why do
they pro-actively seek to offer support, and are often ready to
sacrifice their own life to advance the terrorist cause? A recent
publication by the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence
sheds new insights on how ISIS lures people into terrorism.

First of all, one of the easiest ways is to encourage mental support and
personal belief for the self-proclaimed Caliphate --- rather than to ask
for direct action from the potential recruit. [ISIS uses religion,
convictions, and social narratives to stress how important the
intentions are for jihad. In many of its official publications, ISIS
avoids to ask to participate in suicide missions or to engage on the
battlefield. As such, the organization adopts a more accessible profile
and effectively lowers the private acceptance threshold for those that
still doubt whether they should support the organization. Indeed, for
the people that do not want to fight,]{.underline} ISIS provides
alternative ways to participate in the battle. For instance, they ask
for financial donations that serve to support the Mujahedeen and their
families. As such, [ISIS also creates an appealing narrative of social
protection. This narrative provides the potential recruits a feeling of
trust that the fighters, as well as their families, will not be
forgotten and that somebody will take care of them.]{.underline}

Secondly, [[ISIS aggressively uses multiple media platforms to spread
and amplify news, education, data, and other messages among potential
recruits]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The strategy is designed around a
carefully chosen series of words and images that repetitively talk about
a 'corrupt Western world' that is a threat to the 'Caliphate,' that
'insults Allah,' and that demonizes the 'glorious martyrs.]{.underline}'
The internet has become an excellent medium for spreading the call of
jihad and news on individually featured fighters who are given the
allures of Hollywood movie stars. [[The Internet gives a huge advantage
to ISIS in a sense that the group does not need to be on the ground and
connect face-to-face with potential recruits]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Instead the Caliphate can support itself virtually by establishing
global discussions forums or e-mail lists that facilitate the sharing of
news and literature. For ISIS, online jihad is as important as boots on
the ground.

Finally, [ISIS actively communicates how people can be engaged in the
fight against its opponents]{.underline}. The group has built a
narrative around the concept that 'the Islamic State needs You,' while
stressing that the defeat of the Caliphate would not be due to the
strength of the enemy, but rather to the weakness of the people who are
still hesitating to give support. In this respect, ISIS actively
appropriates the Islamic concepts of 'Walaa' and 'Baraa' --- loyalty to
Allah and hostility toward the enemies of the Caliphate --- to galvanize
personal commitment from Muslim believers around the world. Religious
loyalty is used in hope that it will influence those that are still
hesitating to actively engage in the battle. To that purpose, ISIS
publications regularly feature inspiring stories of those who have
already showed dedication and sacrifice by travelling to Syria or Iraq,
and even engaged in suicide missions, but also suggesting a feeling of
guilt to the Muslims who remain passive.

[The phenomenon of home-based and foreign fighters has long been on the
list of concerns]{.underline}, but arguably, it is only since recent
that it features among our top priorities[[. The international community
may have underestimated the threat of
radicalization]{.underline}]{.mark} among our populations. [[And many
countries in Europe, in North America, and elsewhere in the world have
paid a heavy price for miscalculating the impact of ISIS's recruitment
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} on our security. Indeed since it declared
its Caliphate in June 2014, [[ISIS has relentlessly used its recruits to
spread fear and carnage]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to a running
count kept by CNN, [[the self-proclaimed Islamic State conducted or
inspired more than 140 terrorist attacks in 29
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} (other than Iraq and Syria) killing at
least 2,043 people. These attacks were conducted across the globe
including Europe, North America, Russia, and Asia. In this light [[it is
of vital interest that we continue to improve our understanding how ISIS
is luring people into terrorism. The recruitment of individuals who
eventually become willing to fight and carry out these attacks is, and
will remain, an essential part of the ISIS terrorist
strategy.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**Terrorist attacks cause nuclear retaliation**

**Ayson 10** \[Robert, Professor of Strategic Studies, Director of
Strategic Studies: New Zealand, Senior Research Associate with Oxford's
Centre for International Studies. "After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack:

33, Issue 7, July 2010, pages 571-593\]

Washington\'s early response to a terrorist nuclear attack on its own
soil might also raise the possibility of an unwanted (and nuclear aided)
confrontation with Russia and/or China. For example, [[in the]{.mark}
noise and confusion during the immediate [aftermath of]{.mark} the
[terrorist]{.mark} nuclear [attack,]{.mark} the U.S. [president]{.mark}
might be expected to [place the country\'s armed forces, **including**
]{.mark}**its [nuclear arsenal]{.mark}**[, on]{.mark} a
**[high]{.mark}**er stage of **[alert]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In such a
tense environment, when careful planning runs up against the friction of
reality, it is just possible that [**[Moscow]{.mark}** and/[or
**China**]{.mark} might mistakenly [read this as]{.mark} a sign of U.S.
[intentions to use force]{.mark} (and possibly nuclear force) [against
them]{.mark}.]{.underline} In that situation, the temptations to preempt
such actions might grow, although it must be admitted that [any
preemption [would]{.mark}]{.underline} probably still [[meet]{.mark}
with a **[devastating response]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As [part of its
initial response to the act of nuclear terrorism]{.underline} (as
discussed earlier) [Washington might [decide to order a]{.mark}
significant conventional (or **[nuclear]{.mark}**)
**[retaliatory]{.mark}** or disarming **[attack]{.mark}**]{.underline}
against the leadership of the terrorist group and/or states seen to
support that group. Depending on the identity and especially the
location of these targets, Russia and/or China might interpret such
action as being far too close for their comfort, and potentially as an
infringement on their spheres of influence and even on their
sovereignty. One far-fetched but perhaps not impossible scenario might
stem from a judgment in Washington that some of the main aiders and
abetters of the terrorist action resided somewhere such as Chechnya,
perhaps in connection with what Allison claims is the "Chechen
insurgents\' ... long-standing interest in all things nuclear."42
American pressure on that part of the world would almost certainly raise
alarms in Moscow that ...might require a degree of advanced consultation
from Washington that the latter found itself unable or unwilling to
provide.

#### NATO can use meme warfare to counter ISIS recruitment narratives

Robbie **Gramer 17** -- Gramer reports on diplomacy and national
security for Foreign Policy. ("Can NATO Weaponize Memes?," Foreign
Policy, 04-13-17,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/13/nato-cyber-information-warfare-battle-of-ideas-memes-internet-culture/,
Accessed 07-17-22, LASA-KK)

But if the most powerful political-military alliance has the real
battlefield on lockdown, [[some worry it's floundering in the
battlefield of the internet]{.mark}, where ideas go to clash, [Kremlin
trolls go to spread half-truths, and ISIS goes to recruit foreign
fighters.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The answer,]{.mark} some [experts argue, lies in memes]{.mark}
---]{.underline} those strange jokes and references that come out of the
internet's woodworks from seemingly nowhere, and seem to end up
everywhere at once. A small contingent of [[academics and experts want
NATO to get in on the action to confront pro-Russian, anti-NATO trolls,
or to push back against internet jihadists in the cyber
space.]{.underline}]{.mark}

"[[It's time to embrace memetic warfare]{.mark},]{.underline}" wrote
Jeff Giesea, a widely-known social media and tech guru, in an article in
2015. "[Trolling, it might be said, is the social media equivalent of
guerrilla warfare, and memes are its currency of propaganda." Giesea
wasn't writing in Wired or TechCrunch, but rather in Defence Strategic
Communications, the journal of NATO Strategic Communications Center of
Excellence]{.underline} (or Stratcom COE, because nothing's complete
without an onerous acronym).

["[Daesh is conducting memetic warfare. The Kremlin is doing it. It's
inexpensive. The capabilities exist. Why aren't we trying it?"]{.mark}
Giesea asked.]{.underline}

It's a question many military minds have been asking for years. A Marine
Corps Major, Michael B. Prosser advocated for the U.S. military to
develop a Meme Warfare Center (MWC) in his 2006 study, "Memetics--A
Growth Industry in U.S. Military Operations" (abstract here).

Five years later, [a specialized Pentagon unit, the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) funded a study on "Military Memetics,"
one of several related research programs into what it calls a "subset of
neuro-cognitive warfare." It argued [the "war of ideas" was fundamental,
especially when it comes to fighting terrorists, and the key
characteristics of a military meme is that it be "information that
propagates, has impact, and persists]{.mark}." Like dancing cat videos,
in other words, but with sharper claws.]{.underline}

[The problem is that NATO, like governments everywhere, are pretty
terrible at the internet[. Meme's aren't really part of NATO's arsenal
yet, even if the alliance is desperately trying to tap into ideas from
the private sector about how best to use social
media.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Kremlin-backed trolls and internet-savvy ISIS supporters run circles
around government social media programs, often run by stodgy diplomats
with no authority to be creative]{.underline}. (The quest for funny
memes is particularly tortured: In March, NATO's Stratcom COE published
"Stratcom Laughs: In Search of an Analytical Framework," which included
a chapter on "Humor as a Communication Tool: Designing Framework for
Analysis.")

### ISIL Extensions

#### Absent collective action against ISIL's information operations, ISIL will exploit divisions within NATO 

Eirik **Hognestad 17** -- Hognestad has a Master of Military Art and
Science from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College ("NATO
Cohesion: The Threat Posed by ISIL," US Army Command and General Staff
College, 06-14-19, <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1105114.pdf>,
Accessed 07-10-22, LASA-KK)

ISIL does not have the military power to pose a military threat to NATO.
However, as earlier discussed and reflected in the COG analysis,
[[NATO's weakness is within the organization
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}. The question is therefore if ISIL has the
capability and intention to exploit the internal critical
vulnerabilities directly or indirectly. [Different narratives of the
threat from ISIL and threat priorities feed into the different member
states national strategies, and therefore the political will to commit
military and diplomatic power to fight ISIL]{.underline}. Therefore, [if
ISIL should exploit one of NATO's critical vulnerabilities, **[the most
dangerous]{.mark}** Course of Action ([**COA**) **is to**]{.mark} use
ways and means that will [**drive a wedge between the different national
strategies among the member states.** One way]{.mark} of doing this
[will be to target the narrative of the threat perception]{.mark} of the
terror organization.]{.underline} An approach leaning against the "near
enemy" strategy may thus be a wise strategy from ISIL's view because the
further away the threat is, the less dangerous it is felt. Thus, it
affects the dynamic relationship between the government, the military
forces and the population of the different member states. As a result,
political will may thus be affected in three ways: 1) the perseverance
to continue to send troops and military hardware to ISIL's core areas
when ISIL is not a threat towards the member states, 2) legitimacy to
priority funding for a threat that is felt less dangerous than others,
and 3) legitimacy of the risk involved in taking casualties. Even though
one may argue that reduced political will to fight ISIL is not a threat
towards NATO itself, failed concurrence of threat priority is because it
affects the cohesion that the alliance is built upon as a source of
power. Hence, [[if one or more member states fails to recognize the
threat towards other member states]{.mark}, and thus refuse to commit to
the common defense[, **the alliance may start to
disintegrate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Therefore, [if ISIL targets one
particular member state and focuses all its power against it, the
narrative of ISIL as a threat may differ.]{.mark} It may [lead to a
decline in the mental interoperability that NATO's cohesion depends
on]{.mark} because other member states are more concerned by nearpeer
threats such as Russia, China or Iran. This leads to different
priorities for use of NATO's power among the member states and thereby
creates internal friction in the alliance.]{.underline} To illustrate;
the Eurobarometer survey of 2018 showed a decrease in support for
combating terrorism from 41% in April 2018 to 30% five months later,
which is a significant reduction from the previous surveys where
terrorism issues were at the top of Europeans' concerns (European
Parliament 2018, 68). Only the United Kingdom believed that the fight
against terrorism should be one of Parliament's #1 priority (38%). Among
the other member states, "results show a general and significant decline
of the number of respondents asking for this policy to be a top
priority, led by Italy -19 (29%), Portugal -18 (28%) and Spain -18
(25%)" (European Parliament 2018, 68). As the example shows, NATO
members differ widely in the perception of the priority to combat
terrorism. Further, [[the feeling of an unequal share of the burden
through participation and funding/investment creates tension within the
alliance that may be exploited]{.mark}.]{.underline} The feeling of
threat relates to the passion in the population and thus political will
to prioritize resources to reduce the threat, to include both human
resources (troops), military capabilities, and economical funding. These
[national resources need to be prioritized against other national
strategies on the political agenda. [Therefore, a feeling of inequality
and unfair share of burden within NATO creates friction and
discontent]{.mark} because all]{.underline} 81 [member states need to
balance their resources]{.underline} to reach their strategical ends to
develop their nations according to their political programs and
policies. [[The core of the NATO alliance is common defense, and thus if
the feeling of "common" is not met, the passion to support the NATO
alliance in the population is reduced]{.mark} which affects political
will. By targeting the feeling of inequality of the Alliance, [ISIL may
disturb the internal cohesion of NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline} Means such
as [**[Info]{.mark}rmation [Operations]{.mark}** [directed at specific
member **states to affect the narrative of the threat from ISIL** may
lead to different threat perspectives within the
Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Further, selectively targeting certain
military capabilities and soldiers to increase casualties for a specific
member state may affect the population's support and political will to
maintain the use of resources for CT purposes. With the strategic shift
to operate within the framework of the "Near Enemy" strategy, and [by
increasing IO campaigns to include poetry, community projects and
religious preaching in contrast to the brutal propaganda acts the world
witnessed between 2014-16, **[ISIL may change the narrative of the group
with regards to both the global Muslim community and NATO
members]{.mark}.** The reduction of violent and bloody propaganda may be
appealing to Muslims that, until now, have shied away from ISIL's
brutality, and it may affect the different member states' perception of
the group as a threat. Hence, exploitation of NATO's critical
vulnerabilities related to threat perception may result in different
national narratives and priorities of political will and support of the
populace. As a result, NATO's attitude related to perseverance and
legitimacy may differ within the different member states, leading to
different national strategies prevailing above NATO's political will.
[This may lead to a **break of the trust upon
which**]{.mark}]{.underline} 82 [**[the alliance rests, and ultimately
the cohesion]{.mark}** among the member states.]{.underline} Hence, the
COG of NATO may be affected by ISIL.

#### That leads to ISIL recruitment that radicalizes and polarizes the west

Eirik **Hognestad 17** -- Hognestad has a Master of Military Art and
Science from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College ("NATO
Cohesion: The Threat Posed by ISIL," US Army Command and General Staff

[**[ISIL seeks to polarize]{.mark}** Western and Muslim
Communities]{.underline}. The intention of this goal is related to
ISIL's goal of mobilizing potential supporters both in their core areas
and globally. By taking "leadership" against Western or external
involvement, [ISIL is probably [seeking to stand out as an attractive,
dynamic, and strong organization for rebel movements and terrorist
organizations]{.mark} globally]{.underline}. Hence, ISIL seeks to use
this objective for recruiting new members and thereby new combat forces.
The [[instruments]{.mark} for achieving the goal [are]{.mark}
international terrorism, **[polarizing communication]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} delinquency in the form of sectarian violence. By using
violent means such as **[brutal executions that are
broadcasted]{.mark}**, ISIL sends a message that their actions could
potentially hit anyone. [ISIL seeks to create fear]{.mark} in the people
of Europe and the West [for the purpose of indirectly influencing
European and Western governments]{.mark}]{.underline}. To achieve this,
[any mobilized supporter who supports ISIL's ideology can use a weapon
he or she has at hand to attack random or selected targets in
Europe]{.underline}. The fact that ISIL deliberately uses extreme
violence made the world look when the American journalist James Foley
was brutally beheaded, and the video was posted on youtube in 2014
entitled "A Message to America." The title itself indicates that the
message is directed to the entire United States, not just to the
governments but to society as a whole. After the decapitation of Foley,
55 ISIL has repeatedly directed bestial and barbaric executions and
published these through various media with the same kind of message. The
[actions in the videos evoke conflicting and different feelings in
people.]{.underline} The sense of fear for the barbaric is undeniably
awakened intentionally, but feelings such as disgust, empathy for the
victims and aggression against ISIL as predators are also prominent.
Based on Abrahm's (2006) theory that terrorism's actions are unable to
communicate a strategic message, one can suggest that if the message
ISIL wants to communicate is rooted in the far enemy strategy, the
strategic message will drown in the effects of the violence. But at the
same time, [[ISIL succeeds in provoking a polarizing message through
this type of communication]{.underline}]{.mark}, which intends to
mobilize supporters (Byman 2015, 178). There are several factors that
point out that this is exactly what ISIL wants to achieve. The actions
are perceived by the West as bestial, medieval, and represent a view of
value and humanity that violates all legal, cultural and ethical
perception and legitimacy seen in Western eyes. Thus[**, [ISIL becomes
an outgroup]{.mark}** from the western in-group, and the polarization of
"us" and "they" is a fact.]{.underline} We, therefore, see that ISIL not
only wants to provoke polarizing conflict lines and a sectarian struggle
in the Muslim population but also between itself and the Western world.
[[The purpose is]{.mark} so much like the polarization of Muslim
societies; [eliminate the gray zone and mobilize supporters to increase
their combat power]{.mark}.]{.underline} The final state of this
strategic sub-goal is achieved when ISIL has polarized the world map
into two groups; "The forces of faith and the forces of atheism," which
gives a clear enemy image and sets the framework for a sectarian
struggle between the groups.

In the field of information and anti-terrorism, [a major concern is the
impact of the Internet]{.underline}. The [[Internet]{.mark} has
**[accelerated the flow of information]{.mark}**, and the boundary of
truth and falsehood are at times, indistinguishable. At the same time,
social conditions can be exaggerated online. Combined with the
psychological activities and circumstances of the masses, it is
extremely easy to create a larger scale of dissatisfaction which will,
to a certain extent, lead to the collapse of the original social
ideological and belief systems.]{.underline} The United States and
Western countries ignoring the social and stage of countries and regions
in the Mediterranean region, Africa, and the Middle East and Central
Asian countries, blindly export their ideology, and driven by the
amplification effect of the Internet, this process of collapse has been
accelerated. [A terrorist organization such as [ISIS has harnessed the
great potentials offered by the Internet]{.mark}, and as such, it laid
the foundation for the large-scale development of **ISIS's information**
warfare. First of all, the Islamic State has [established a professional
public relations organization, responsible for producing and
disseminating content]{.mark}.]{.underline} ISIS has its homepage and
accounts on major social networking sites, and even has multi-layered
sub-accounts, thereby evading censorship. [They [launched]{.mark} DABIQ,
an attractively designed **[online magazine]{.mark}** with extremely
provocative content, and developed a [smartphone **app**]{.mark} called
Dawn of Glad Tidings, focusing on the Western "high-end customer base"
as their target group to inform them of the latest "news of jihad in
real-time". In addition, the Islamic State has also launched the
[**online game**, which creates scenarios for players to attack the U.S.
military, police, and civilians,]{.mark} and rewards criminal acts and
even terrorist attacks in the game]{.underline}. Today, ISIS can be seen
almost on all social media platforms and is accessible in Western
countries. It has thousands of accounts on Twitter alone, including both
organized public accounts and terrorist personal accounts. ISIS is
proficient in the so-called "viral marketing" model in information
warfare. Through the user's network, the [information spreads like a
virus and spreads to thousands of audiences using rapid
replication]{.underline}. The organizer clearly achieves the
word-of-mouth "relationship marketing" by providing a certain product or
service, allowing others to become "marketing and communication levers"
inadvertently. [ISIS is often far more professional and sensitive than
the government departments of various countries that hold the power of
national governance. It has long been keenly aware of the evolution of
political discourse from propaganda to information dissemination in
contemporary society, and this trend is one of the keys that is enabling
it to lead public opinion]{.underline}. Traditional propaganda methods
such as sermons and speeches, obviously, lack interaction with the
target audience. Therefore, [ISIS encourages followers to use various
websites as platforms to establish various forms of "self-media". ISIS
also cultivate Internet influencers to encourage netizens to create
audio messages, videos and even websites. [As ISIS cleverly hides its
ambitions behind high-level productions and attractive propaganda, more
and more people in the West, especially young people, have been
successfully brainwashed]{.mark}, are actively participating in the
dissemination of ISIS-related information, even going to the Middle East
to become jihadists on the battlefield and gain the satisfaction of
realizing their supposed self-worth.]{.underline} This kind of
information warfare was so successful that in 2016, the official website
of Tsinghua University in China was hacked by ISIS hackers where ISIS
recruitment advertisements were posted. In the United States, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has found cases where teenagers as
young as 15 years old were recruited by ISIS, and in some cases in the
United States, parents even encouraged their children to participate in
terrorist organizations. In fact, the information warfare of ISIS is
very active and successful not only in Western countries but also in
Turkey and Syria. As a result, ISIS has obtained the human resources of
thousands of sacrificial young people. The information society and the
Internet have created a huge imbalance for the future world, making this
world an unbalanced world and a world in transition. The formation of
various transnational virtual organizations is now possible using simple
network tools. This also means that terrorist organizations like ISIS
cannot theoretically be eliminated at all. They can easily evolve into
virtualized organizations that exist everywhere and can be found by
search engines at any time due to the ubiquity of the information
society and the Internet. They will continue to grow, gain popularity,
and evolve into a new type of network-based anti-government
organization. Terrorist organizations of various types have shifted
their focus from the real world to the virtual world, and then back
again. This is the enormous governance challenge that the information
society will undoubtedly face in the future. Final analysis conclusion:
Although ISIS faces restrictions as it is a terrorist organization[, [it
**has used the information society and the Internet to launch successful
information warfare** and has achieved remarkable results
worldwide]{.mark}]{.underline}. In an age of information asymmetry,
simple and easy network tools have made it possible to establish a
variety of transnational virtual organizations. **[[This will pose a
huge governance challenge to the future information
society.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### ISIS declared it will use disinformation to divide and defeat enemies

Bridget **Johnson 22** -- Bridget Johnson is a terrorism analyst and
editor at Homeland Security Today. ("ISIS Declares 'Duty' and 'War
Policy' to Deploy Disinformation as a Weapon," Homeland Security Today,
5-6-22,
https://www.hstoday.us/featured/isis-declares-duty-and-war-policy-to-deploy-disinformation-as-a-weapon/,
Accessed 7-17-22, LASA-KK)

[[Disseminating disinformation is a "duty" of jihadists]{.mark} in order
[to]{.mark} deceive and ultimately [divide their foes]{.mark} and should
be considered "part of the war policy," ISIS Khorasan
declared]{.underline} in a new issue of the group's English-language
magazine.

The article in the fifth issue of Voice of Khurasan on making the use of
media and psychological warfare a core tenet of their game plan comes
after the group recently emphasized that "social media warfare" is a
critical part of their strategy.

"[By all its types whether audio, visual, paper, satellite or internet,"
[using various forms of media "is a necessity and is also urgent in
order to propagate and cause defeatism and demoralization of the
enemy]{.mark}, and show the strength of the mujahideen,]{.underline}"
said the latest issue. "...Therefore the media and all its technologies
must be used by the da'ees \[callers to Islam\] and mujahideen to spread
fear into the hearts of the enemy and to terrify them so that they do
not think to stand in front of the Muslims ever."

[[Deploying different types of weaponry is critical for "demonstrating
strength]{.underline}]{.mark}," ISIS argues, [as is "spreading rumors to
strike fear into the heart of the enemy."]{.underline}

["If we can shake the chain of the enemy and divide them [that is part
of the war policy to **divide them and defeat
them**]{.mark}]{.underline}," the article continued. "...[Spreading the
rumors is therefore a duty upon the Muslim armies to cause fragmentation
of the enemy because that disunity will demoralise them
significantly."]{.underline}

"[Spreading fear" is another aim of disinformation that ISIS said is
"very important]{.underline} as it will cause victory for the Muslims,"
and [[disinformation with the goal of deception]{.mark} was also
stressed as crucial:]{.underline} "There is no dispute among the fuqaha
\[Islamic jurists\] that it is allowed to deceive the kuffar
\[disbelievers\] as much as we can in the battlefield."

A separate article in the issue vowed to "continue to target the nations
of Kufr, without differentiating amongst them," adding that their eyes
"are fixed on neighboring countries, Iran, China, Uzbekistan, and other
nations of kufr."

"We we strike them just as we strike you while you will fail miserably
to cover our actions to please your masters," ISIS-K said to the
Taliban.

In their third issue, [ISIS-K declared that a concerted focus on "social
media warfare" is critical to advance on the ideological battlefield but
also in order to counter the pull of "enchanting" social media
influencers.]{.underline}

"War comes in many form and targets different aspects of humans. A war
can be fought militarily targeting physical self or it can be fought
ideologically targeting intellect," said that article. "[As much
importance the physical clashes hold [ideological confrontations]{.mark}
also [matter]{.mark} if not [more]{.mark}. The physical battle can be
lost even before it starts if people, in our case Muslims, are defeated
or at the least trapped in the battle for the hearts and
minds."]{.underline}

"Jihad against the crusaders and their allies is the best way to deter
them. Jihad is not limited to fighting physically, and fighting with
tongues are as important as fighting physically," ISIS-K continued. "In
this age, social media warfare holds the utmost importance as the medias
and social media personalities are enchanting the eyes of the people.
Fighting in this field needs to be done in order to incite the believers
and save other Muslims from the negative impact of the enchanting battle
for hearts and minds."

Voice of Khurasan was first published in February, with a 37-page
inaugural issue. The page counts have decreased since then, with the
fourth issue just 10 pages long and the current issue at 19 pages.

In that first issue, the group declared that theirs is the "most
important province" of ISIS after Iraq and Syria. The magazine furthered
the long-running ISIS narrative that the loss of the group's claimed
caliphate in Iraq and Syria is "temporary," adding that "although we
lost the Khilafah territory and thousands of Mujahideen were martyred in
a period of 5 years, there is no problem."

The second issue similarly dedicated ample space to criticizing the
Taliban and argued that "to this day no entity, no person has ever ...
brought forth a legit argument against the beliefs of the Khalifah"
while slamming the "sheer stupidity" of al-Qaeda leadership. The
magazine also brought up the Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham merger in Syria and a
frequent target of ISIS ire, HTS leader Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, saying
that he has "cut off his group from al-Qaeda, rebranded his group like
he changes underpants in an attempt to escape from terrorism label."

### Memetic Warfare Extensions

#### A NATO memetic warfare strategy is essential to combat false narratives and constantly adapt to new information warfare developments

Matthew **Schleupner 20** -- Schleupner is a U.S. Army Foreign Area
Officer with a focus on Russia and Eastern Europe and holds a master's
degree in international policy, political science, and law. ("The Power
of Memes," George C. Marshall Center, April 2020,

Accessed 07-17-22, LASA-KK)

Strategic messaging in the security space should be viewed as a debate
rather than a conversation. There needs to be an aggressiveness to it
that seeks to control the narrative space, much like an infantry
battalion seeks to hold ground. At the same time, there must be an
awareness that ethical standards preclude democracies from creating a
traditional Soviet-style propaganda system. Rather, better ways must be
sought for spreading the truth in these modern times. [At a time when
[attention spans are shorte]{.mark}r because of technology, and [the
amount of available information has dramatically expanded, NATO needs to
redefine the way it works in the memetic space]{.mark}. It understands
the problem; it just isn't very good at trying to solve it. This
involves a reframing of NATO's mindset and that of its member states.
[NATO as an institution]{.mark}, along with its member states, [can
begin]{.mark} or improve this [with three easy
steps]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[1. [Get on social media]{.mark}]{.underline}

[There is a hesitancy by senior political and military leaders to be
active on social media.]{.underline} Concerns about privacy and security
are real. But this is mainly a mindset problem. [At the Marshall Center
in 2018, leaders from security institutions and NATO/European Union
nations, along with partner nations, gathered to discuss challenges to
strategic communications in the 21st century. In their discussions,
[leaders from NATO and the EU discussed how they are combating false
narratives on the internet. NATO representatives said they had set up a
page labeled "NATO truths" and "NATO-Russia: Setting the record
straight" to combat false narratives on NATO-Russia
issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} The page was a direct response to a series
of Russian messaging campaigns using memetic warfare techniques. I
remember thinking: How many of these leaders are personally active on
social media? How many see how quick memetic warfare can work, and how
effective it really is?

[[A new kind of thinking is needed in the age of Twitter and
Instagram]{.underline}]{.mark}. It appeared as if Alliance leaders did
not understand how social media works. For example, in the 2016 U.S.
presidential campaign, a meme called Pepe the Frog took off among
supporters of then-candidate Donald Trump through the Reddit group
/r/Donald. The supporters were tremendously successful in appropriating
the meme to help their candidate. No fewer than 20 stories appeared in
The New York Times about Pepe the Frog, and there was an effort by the
Pepe the Frog creator to sue trolls on the internet for copyright
infringement. If you simply view the comments of an internet news
article critical of Russia, China or Iran, you will find them filled
with odd statements, usually similar, attacking the article and working
to shape the narrative in a way that negates factual reporting. The New
York Times later reported that the Democratic National Committee used a
false-flag campaign in the U.S. Senate race in Alabama between Roy Moore
and Doug Jones, replicating what they thought were the techniques of
Russian bots to create viral memes against Moore, then blaming Russia
for efforts to interfere in the election.

A senior leader who is not active on social media will have a hard time
understating the full effect of this activity. To be active is at least
to see the battlespace. I would argue that [leaders should be active,
but also vocal in messaging against false, viral campaigns]{.underline}.
For example, consider how President Donald Trump or U.S. Ambassador to
Germany Richard Grenell have fought back against false narratives or
have advanced the truth through their own messaging. Other examples of
leaders using this type of online voice are former Deputy Prime Minister
Matteo Salvini in Italy, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage in the United
Kingdom or President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. The list continues to
grow. An example of this is when the U.S. Embassy in Russia countered
publication of an altered photo of then-U.S. Ambassador to Russia John
Tefft that made it appear he was attending an opposition party rally. In
response, the embassy distributed a series of obviously altered photos
that made it appear Tefft was speaking on the moon, on the ice at a
hockey game, and standing next to U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur as he
landed in the Philippines during World War II. These things seem small,
but they set a true narrative and undermine false ones. In the world of
memes, seizing the narrative and demeaning your adversaries is a total
communications victory.

[2. Memetic warfare as marketing]{.underline}

[[Marketing experts identify four principles necessary for success:
define the strategy before the tactics, narrow the market focus,
differentiate from the competition, and create a total online
presence]{.underline}.]{.mark} Since marketing is a business field
focused more on offensive messaging to create business and control what
people are saying about a business, this fits well in the memetic model.
[NATO and other Western security institutions seemingly understand that
a gap exists in the understanding of this new communications
technique]{.underline}. But the strategy is in its infancy, with online
trials that fail for various reasons[. [The strategy here needs to flow
from successful marketing principles and from the fact that NATO should
not overthink its memetic messaging]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Each problem
set, each messaging campaign should be different and depend on the
market NATO is trying to reach, the hook it is trying to employ, and the
total presence it is attempting to achieve. [Because information on the
internet moves so quickly, the messaging strategy must be flexible, with
maximum leeway given to those creating the messaging program]{.mark}.
NATO should create a committee in this communications field and not be
afraid to discuss and/or employ figures who are successful at memetic
messaging.]{.underline}

This could be controversial at times because of the types of people
generally associated with spreading memes. But experts in marketing,
psychology and technology could be employed for oversight. Still,
reaching out to personalities in the social media realm would be an
absolute must. To be clear, when I say personalities I mean trolls ---
from Twitter, Reddit, 4chan and other social media platforms. Even if
they aren't directly employed by NATO, their methods must be studied and
understood. [[The power of memes is that they appear organic rather than
corporately produced]{.underline}]{.mark}. Understanding what youths in
Estonia or Ukraine find persuasive within their cultural context will be
difficult without surveying and employing people in those domains. As
Giesea points out, there is a sense of guerrilla warfare in the
execution of trolling and memetic warfare. So the more NATO can develop
a plan to gather bottom-fed information, the better.

[3. [Don't be afraid to make mistakes]{.mark}]{.underline}

NATO commissioned a series of videos revolving around its 60-year
anniversary in 2009 that attempted to adopt a memetic warfare posture,
but they did not go viral in the way many expected. The U.S. State
Department, in response to the success of ISIS' online recruiting,
created the "Think Again, Turn Away" program. But it ended without
achieving the success many had hoped for. At least institutions are
trying. The field of technology permeates with the theory that you must
test and continue to test, always to the point that things break. Moving
fast is critical, and that type of thinking can be antithetical to a
military and political mindset that values polished and deliberative
communications strategies. On the internet, there may be a need to
respond to viral memes that have a maximum impact of 10 hours or less.

#### Current strategic communications fail -- NATO allies must work together to embrace memetic warfare to counter ISIS and Russia

Jeff **Giesea 16** -- Giesea is an entrepreneur who has written many
papers for NATO. ("It's time to embrace memetic warfare," NATO Strategic
Communications Centre of Excellence, 3-1-16,
<https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/jeff_gisea.pdf>, Accessed
7-17-22, LASA-KK)

[The term 'memetic warfare' has come into use on the fringes of foreign
policy thinkers in the last five years to describe these types of
efforts. I believe [memetic warfare could be effective in countering
Daesh's recruiting and propaganda efforts]{.mark} and in modern conflict
in general]{.underline}, including operations other than war. [Trolling,
it might be said, is the social media equivalent of guerrilla warfare,
and memes are its currency of propaganda. [Daesh is conducting memetic
warfare. The Kremlin is doing it. It's inexpensive. The capabilities
exist. Why aren't we trying it?]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[It's no secret that the U.S. and NATO allies have done a poor job
combating Daesh]{.mark} on social media thus far]{.underline}. In June
2015, the U.S. State Department conducted an internal assessment of its
communications efforts that admitted that the [NATO-led coalition is
losing the social media war with Daesh]{.underline}. Existing efforts
like the 'Think Again, Turn Away' campaign have proven ineffective
against the tide of outreach coming the other way. [By mid-2015 there
were an estimated 30,000 foreign Daesh combatants, with the majority
coming from NATO countries. Experts [say Daesh's recruiting is reaching
'network effect' velocity]{.mark}, and much of it is conducted through
Twitter, YouTube, and other social media. [The need to counter Daesh's
communications onslaught is urgent.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Kalev Leetaru makes a compelling case for a more muscular communication
approach in a July article in Foreign Policy. The article, 'A Few Good
Internet Trolls', argues that more aggressive and comprehensive cyber
communication efforts are needed as battlefields shifts online.

What Leetaru and others seem to overlook, however, is that selling the
high-level concept is not the hard part. [Political leaders already
understand the need for a more aggressive approach, at least at an
abstract level. The hard part is actually making it happen, of
transitioning the abstract concept into reality and, in turn,
victory]{.underline}. There are numerous obstacles standing in the way:
conceptual ones, financial ones, cultural ones, legal and bureaucratic
ones, and strategic ones.

Here are several things we need to do to overcome these obstacles. By
pursuing these, we can bring to life smarter online strategic
communication practices and adapt civilian practices that can help us
defeat present and potential enemies like Daesh.

[Develop Memetic Warfare Conceptually]{.underline}

The first challenge is conceptual[. [Neither NATO nor its individual
members have fully developed a language or conceptual grounding for
social media-focused Strategic
Communications]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} Memetic warfare today
is a fringe concept, but it shouldn't be. [It [needs to be developed and
brought into]{.mark} mainstream [military thinking]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[In doing so, it should be thought of as broader and more strategic than
'weaponized trolling'. [Memetic warfare]{.mark}, as I define it, [is
competition over narrative, ideas, and social control in a social-media
battlefield. One might think of it as a subset of 'information
operations' tailored to social media]{.mark}. Information operations
involve the collection and dissemination of information to establish a
competitive advantage over an opponent. [Memetic warfare could also be
viewed as a 'digital native' version of psychological warfare]{.mark},
more commonly known as propaganda]{.underline}. If propaganda and public
diplomacy are conventional forms of memetic warfare, then trolling and
PSYOPs are guerrilla versions.

[Memetic warfare can be useful at the grand narrative level, at the
battle level, or in a special circumstance. [It can be offensive,
defensive, or predictive. It can be deployed independently or in
conjunction with cyber, hybrid, or conventional efforts]{.mark}. The
online battlefield of perception will only grow in importance in both
warfare and diplomacy. Regardless of what we call it, NATO countries
must continue to develop a body of knowledge around social-media
Strategic Communications.]{.underline}

Allocate Better Resources to It

[[Greater]{.mark} investment [-- and better investment -- is
required]{.mark}]{.underline}, too. [As NATO members continue to
aggressively invest in cyber warfare and cyber security, [they should
also invest in memetic warfare.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Let's clarify how these areas relate. Cyber warfare involves attacking a
nation's computers and networks to cause disruption or gather
intelligence, or defending against such attacks. Examples include the
Stuxnet virus that sabotaged Iran's nuclear program in 2010, or China's
breach of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management files in early 2015
(and the U.S.'s response). They involved no physical combat in the
traditional military sense.

Cyber warfare is about taking control of data[. [Memetic warfare is
about taking control of the dialogue, narrative, and psychological
space. It's about]{.mark} denigrating, disrupting, and [subverting the
enemy's effort]{.mark} to do the same. Like cyber warfare, memetic
warfare is asymmetrical in impact. [It can be highly effective relative
to cost]{.mark}. The attack surface can be large or small. Memetic
warfare can be used in conjunction with troops, ships, aircraft, and
missiles, or it can be employed without any kinetic military force at
all. [It operates in the communications
battlespace.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The communications battlespace, of course, is where we are losing to
Daesh]{.mark}.]{.underline} Ambassador Alberto Fernandez, former head of
the U.S. State Department's Center for Strategic Counterterrorism
Communications (CSCC), gave a frank assessment of communication efforts
in an outgoing interview last year. '[It's not that ISIS is so great',
he said. 'It is that [the response to ISIS is both limited and
weak]{.mark}.']{.underline}

If the communications battlespace is where we're losing, why aren't we
investing more in it? Why has NATO placed itself in the position of
responding to Daesh rather than having prevented Daesh and similar
forces from existing in the first place? [Why hasn't NATO gone on the
offensive to wipe out Daesh and other jihadists as credible
psychopolitical movements?]{.underline} (The discussion of waiting until
extremists become violent before they are countered --- the essence of
Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) initiatives --- rather than
forestalling their rise in the first place is another issue entirely,
but it is one that can also be addressed through memetic warfare.) [NATO
and many of its members individually are investing some funds in
strategic communication]{.underline}s, with the U.S. State Department
alone spending \$118 million in 2015. [Yet the amounts, while
impressive, are miniscule in proportion to what we're spending
overall.]{.underline}

Even at current spending levels, [one must question how effectively
these resources are being allocated]{.underline}. The civilian funds
directed toward CVE and communications are relying on public diplomacy
and top-down 'conventional' Strategic Communications, with military
information operations and PSYOP showing themselves to be tepid, timid,
and stale. Where is there experimentation? Where are the guerrilla
efforts? Where is the innovation? Where is the war-gaming of tactical
successes at the Strategic Communications level?

[NATO's communications efforts to date are like Version 1.0 of a
software program. Releasing the first version is incredibly difficult
and an accomplishment in its own right, but [now it is time for version
2.0]{.mark}]{.underline} and a more serious commitment to rapid learning
and improvement. [To get there, [NATO and individual member countries
must commit more physical resources and command authority to Strategic
Communications, allocate existing spending more intelligently, and
provide intellectual and operational space for learning and
innovation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Embrace the Memetic Mindset

Perhaps the greatest obstacle to memetic warfare is a lack of
appreciation for social media as a battle space and the extent to which
memetic warfare is already taking place. Perhaps this is generational[:
from the outside looking in, it doesn't appear that the alliance's
military and foreign policy decision-makers truly understand social
media at all]{.underline}, much less as a tool and weapon for the common
defense. How many generals are active on Twitter and truly understand it
beyond the explanations of their kids or younger colleagues?

Even for those of us who live on social media, it is sometimes difficult
to appreciate how quickly information can spread, the profundity of its
global scope, and the significance of its impact on perceptions,
narratives, and social movements. [[Once one starts viewing the Internet
through meme-colored glasses, you see memetic warfare everywhere]{.mark}
--- in political campaigns, in contested narratives about news events,
in the thoughtless memes shared by Facebook friends, and in videos on
YouTube]{.underline}. It shows up in movements like #BlackLivesMatter,
where there's an attempt to shape perceptions and galvanize public
support. In the U.S. Republican Primary race, Jeb Bush recently
attempted to paint Donald Trump as the 'chaos candidate'. But when his
campaign tried spreading a #ChaosCandidate hashtag, trolls supporting
Trump took it over and used it to denigrate Jeb Bush. Hashtags, one
might say, are operational coordinates of memetic warfare.

On the geopolitical stage, [[memetic warfare is being used in a military
capacity by centralized governments like China and Russia, in addition
to non-state actors like Daesh]{.underline}]{.mark}. Anyone who has read
the comments on news articles related to foreign policy has probably
noticed some suspiciously inauthentic, biased comments. China employs
20,000-50,000 Internet police and an additional quarter-million 'trolls'
who spread pro-Beijing material domestically and abroad, and who help
monitor citizens.

[Similarly, Russia has 'troll farms' where Internet commentators spread
pro-Moscow messages and disinformation. It tends to use memetic warfare
offensively.]{.underline} It has been notorious in its disinformation
related to Ukraine, from the 'green men' who were 'not' Russian troops,
to the shoot-down of the Malaysian airliner, to the nature of the
Ukrainian government itself. Moscow has also targeted domestic affairs
in the U.S. In 2014, Russian trolls spread disinformation about a
chemical plant explosion in Louisiana under the #ColumbianChemicals
hashtag. They spread similar disinformation about an Ebola outbreak in
Atlanta, under #EbolaInAtlanta. [In each case, there were fake videos,
photos, and Wikipedia pages, combined with outreach to journalists and
buzz centered on a hashtag. As the United States has downsized its
information operations and PSYOP capabilities, the Kremlin's RT
propaganda house has begun to recruit former professionals.]{.underline}

A 'memetic skirmish' involving the U.S. Embassy in Moscow demonstrates
that talented and creative State Department communicators are poised to
act when allowed. In August 2015, the local news in Moscow released a
photo showing U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Tefft conducting a press
conference at an opposition rally. The photo, according to the U.S.
Embassy, was a fake. It seemed to be deliberate disinformation. The
Embassy had a brilliant response. 'Ambassador Tefft spent his day off
yesterday at home', the embassy tweeted. 'But thanks to Photoshop, he
could be anywhere.' Shortly thereafter, various Russian twitter accounts
released the same press conference photo of Ambassador Tefft against a
variety of backgrounds - landing on the moon, surrounded by cats, at
various weddings, at a hockey game, landing in the Philippines with
General MacArthur during World War II, and elsewhere. It became a meme,
and Russia's disinformation effort backfired.

The Ambassador's Photoshop imbroglio recalls a meme from early in 2015,
when Daesh was demanding \$200 million in ransom to release two Japanese
journalists. The terrorists released a photo of Jihadi John wielding a
sharp knife above the heads of the two Japanese men, kneeling in orange
jumpsuits. As the 72-hour deadline to pay the ransom passed, Japanese
Twitter accounts began sharing doctored images of the threatening photo
set against darkly comic backgrounds --- one with Jihadi John holding a
banana instead of a knife, another of him wearing Mickey Mouse ears and
the Disney Magic Kingdom in the background, and another with him wearing
pink lingerie in a field of flowers. The 'meme-ing' of the image was
viewed as a symbol of defiance among the Japanese, a classic
denigration. It did not save the life of journalist Kenji Goto, but it
may have helped lessen the psychological impact of Daesh's propaganda.

[[For memetic warfare to succeed, decision-makers need to get into the
right mindset and empower those who have it.]{.mark} Study what's worked
and what hasn't.]{.underline} Network across civilian disciplines,
particularly with Internet trolls, hackers, marketers, and PR pros. To
the extent possible, experiment on social media yourself or through
those close to you. Try following and influencing an issue[. [Embrace
memetic warfare as an essential capability in modern
warfare.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[No one is better to support this than the NATO Strategic
Communications Centre of Excellence]{.mark}.]{.underline} I recommend
organizing a cross-disciplinary global summit on memetic warfare.
Consider focusing it specifically on countering Daesh and giving it the
feel of a TED conference (perhaps partner with them), drawing fresh
ideas, perspectives, and connections from multiple disciplines and
countries.

#### Memetic warfare and awareness can be used to counter disinformation

Tom **Ascott 20** -- Ascott is a writer at the Australian Strategic
Policy Institute. ("How memes are becoming the new frontier of
information warfare," Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 02-19-20,
<https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/how-memes-are-becoming-the-new-frontier-of-information-warfare/>,
Accessed 07-15-22, LASA-KK)

Memes might appear as if they're just little pranks kids play online,
yet they're anything but[. In the 2016 US presidential election, many
memes were made by a Russian troll farm to influence the outcome. It
wasn't an isolated incident, either---[now troll farms are popping up
more frequently]{.mark}]{.underline}. In November last year, an
undercover reporter revealed a new one in Poland. The memes it's
producing focus on 'the aviation and defence industries, and target key
decision-makers involved in the awarding of major government defence
contracts'. [The memeing, it has transpired, was political.]{.underline}

[[Those memes were a form of information warfare]{.underline}]{.mark},
or what would have been thought of in the past as a psychological
operation. Information warfare is often about waging an influence
campaign that can change behaviour through 'unconventional means', such
as social media. [Memes play a part in a specific type of information
warfare dubbed 'memetic warfare'.]{.underline}

Early memetic warfare used a more 'Dawkinsian' concept of memes. In his
1976 book The selfish gene, Richard Dawkins coined the term 'meme' for a
cultural product that can replicate and spread. The meme concept had
immediate and clear implications for information warfare campaigns.

[[Meme warfare now more often refers to using memes as individual
weapons of information warfare.]{.mark} It's a [form of disinformation
that can be used to secure strategic goals]{.mark}. Disinformation
campaigns go to back to at least 1923, when the Soviet Union had an
office for 'dezinformatsiya' campaigns---a term coined by Stalin to
describe 'false information carefully constructed with the intention to
deceive'. [The internet has ushered in an age when deception can be
perpetrated on a mass scale, with the click of a
mouse.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The West is desperately lagging in its memetic capability. US Marine
Corps Major]{.mark} Michael B. Prosser [proposed that NATO open a meme
warfare centre]{.mark}. In his 2006 thesis, he looked to Dawkins's ideas
of memes as units of cultural transmission that held the potential to
'be used like medicine to inoculate the enemy and generate popular
support'. He noted that information operations, psychological operations
and strategic communications weren't using memes effectively. In the
following decade, [NATO never did open a meme warfare]{.mark}
[centre]{.mark}, but the idea didn't go away and is now starting to gain
traction again.]{.underline}

At the same time, across the pond, DARPA funded Dr Robert Finkelstein to
investigate how it might weaponise memes. In his presentation to the
Social Media for Defense Summit, Finkelstein recommended memetic warfare
for all public affairs units, the Central Intelligence Agency and the US
Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command.

It wasn't until 2017 that the EU and NATO established the European
Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats. While understanding
memes as information warfare falls within its remit, its purpose is more
analytical than proactive. Currently, it seems, the best form of defence
is awareness.

[[Memes resemble traditional propaganda in a few ways; a hostile
government can use them to spread malicious information]{.mark} in a way
that's advantageous to it. But there are key differences, too. [Because
memes are a common way for people to express themselves online, it's
very easy to make memes without their being suspected as pieces of
information warfare]{.mark}.]{.underline} And they can be much more
targeted. Traditional propaganda focuses on large groups of people who
have some spatial or political link. The way the internet 'fingerprints'
users allows hostile actors to draw up their own lists, looking for
links even users don't know they share.

[Authoritarian regimes may be less susceptible to memetic warfare
because they have more control over their social media
systems]{.underline}. China employs '20,000--50,000 internet police and
an additional quarter-million "trolls" who spread pro-Beijing material
domestically and abroad'. Memetic warfare isn't just military, but civil
as well. Some 1,200 TikTok channels are run by various Chinese civil
authorities such as 'police stations, SWAT teams, traffic police, and
prisons'. They've produced more than 13,000 videos and amassed a
combined 4.8 billion views. It's a domestic attempt to control the
online narrative by the security services. It's unlikely that a meme
(such as that Chinese police are responsible for assassinating
high-profile individuals) will spread there, whether produced internally
or by the West.

[Memes also can have dual functions. As well as acting as a form of
information warfare[, they can help normalise extreme behaviours through
humour]{.mark}. For example, memes can be recruitment tools for white
nationalist groups. The Christchurch mosque terrorist, Brenton Tarrant,
frequently used 8chan. All chan sites require users to submit images
with text. As a result, these right-wing sites are a fertile breeding
ground for memes that normalise extreme behaviour and reinforce each
other. Slowly, the memes seep out into more common areas of the
internet, such as Twitter]{.underline}. That everyone on 4chan should be
considered a terrorist is itself already a meme on 4chan.

Russian propaganda about the war in Ukraine
[[cratered]{.underline}](about:blank) last month after Russian state
news channels were blocked in Europe and restricted globally. But in
recent weeks, [**[China has emerged as a]{.mark}** potent **[outlet for
Kremlin disinformatio]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[n]{.mark},** researchers
say, [[portraying Ukraine and NATO as the aggressors]{.mark} and sharing
false claims about neo-Nazi control of the Ukrainian
government]{.underline}. With over a billion followers on Facebook
alone, [China's state-controlled channels [offer]{.mark} Russian
President Vladimir [Putin a]{.mark} powerful
[megaphone]{.mark}]{.underline} for shaping global understanding of
[[the war]{.underline}](about:blank) --- often called a "special
operation" in line with Kremlin rhetoric. Since Russia invaded Ukraine
on Feb. 24, researchers say, [[Chinese channels have touted the false
claim that the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [runs bioweapons labs in
Ukraine]{.mark}, have asserted that Ukrainian neo-Nazis bombed a
children's hospital which was in fact bombed by Russian troops, and have
suggested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was being
manipulated by U.S. billionaire George Soros]{.underline}. Chinese
channels also have given airtime and amplification to high-ranking
Russian government officials and to presenters from Russian government
channels whose shows have been restricted or blocked. Last month, after
a host on Sputnik, the Russian state news outlet, posted a video on his
personal YouTube channel discussing how neo-Nazis were on the rise in
Ukraine, the clip was tweeted by Frontline, a Chinese government outlet.
"With governments and tech platforms moving to censor or limit the
spread of Russian propaganda, pro-Kremlin talking points are now being
laundered through influencers and proxies, including Chinese officials
and state media outlets that obviously do not face the same restrictions
that have been placed on Russian state media outlets," said Bret
Schafer, senior fellow and head of the information manipulation team at
the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a nonpartisan initiative housed at
the U.S. German Marshall Fund that tracks Chinese and Russian state
media. "This has allowed the Kremlin to effectively skirt bans meant to
limit the spread of Russian propaganda." [[Putin's success]{.mark} in
seeding some of these misleading narratives through proxies and allies
[is casting doubt on the abilit]{.mark}y of Western governments and the
tech giants [to]{.mark} effectively [rein in]{.mark} the most pernicious
forms of [authoritarian propaganda]{.mark}]{.underline}. With China's
help, experts say, Russia also is regaining its ability to cloud the
narrative around Europe's biggest conflict since World War II. "While
the world's eyes are still on Ukraine, and the journalists are there,
it's going to be hard for the Russian government to make great progress.
But they can make progress on the edges," said Kate Starbird, an
associate professor in the Department of Human Centered Design &
Engineering at the University of Washington. "And in the long run, if
the public is confused enough about what happened, then we might not
give our leadership a clear message to take action." *s*ince the war's
early days, when the European Commission blocked Russian state channels
and Twitter, YouTube and Facebook [restricted their reach](about:blank),
Russia has raced to create workarounds. Journalists have uncovered a
coordinated campaign to pay TikTok influencers to push pro-Kremlin
views, while researchers from the data science company Trementum
Analytics have documented pro-Russia trolls spamming YouTube videos
about Ukraine with pro-Russian comments. The Russian government also has
used its embassies to push out misinformation to tens of thousands of
followers on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and the messaging app Telegram.
According to the Israeli disinformation research group FakeReporter,
Russian embassies have created at least 65 new Telegram channels since
the war began. Twitter stopped recommending these accounts this week.
Fox News and other right-leaning American outlets also have picked up
Russia's talking points --- notably when Fox host Tucker Carlson last
month promoted to his prime time audience the baseless claim that
Ukraine was developing biological weapons with the assistance of the
U.S. government. According to disinformation researchers and the
fact-checking group PolitiFact, that claim, which has been circulating
for years, is a misleading reference to a public health research
partnership between the United States and Ukraine; the White House has
called it "preposterous." Last week, the New York Post wrote an article
tying the discredited biolab claim to President Biden's son Hunter,
claiming that the younger Biden had helped secure funds for a start-up
that worked on the research biolabs in Ukraine. The Washington Post [has
reported](about:blank) that Hunter Biden "was not part of a decision\"
to invest in the start-up. Meanwhile, highly active online communities,
such as anti-vaccine activists and adherents of the radicalized movement
QAnon, have seized on the biolab claim and other Russian narratives. An
[early, prolific spreader](about:blank) of the theory, according to the
Anti-Defamation League, was a Virginia man with ties to QAnon.
[*'*](about:blank) China is, by far, the Kremlin's biggest promoter,
however. The top four Chinese outlets --- CGTN, Global Times, Xinhua
News and T-House --- command a massive audience with a combined follower
count on Facebook of 283 million, according to research from the
nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). All told, Chinese
outlets on Facebook have over 1 billion followers, according to the
Alliance for Securing Democracy --- far more than the roughly 85 million
total followers for Russia's main channels. Asked how Facebook was
addressing China's emergence as a vector for Russian propaganda,
Facebook shared several examples of fact checks applied to misleading
pro-Russian content from Chinese state media. The company did not
respond to questions about whether it has restricted Chinese state media
accounts or has plans to do so. Twitter spokeswoman Madeline Broas said
the company had placed some limits on Chinese state media for several
years, and that --- beginning last Friday --- it had begun putting
highly-visible labels on any tweet that contained a link to Chinese
state media. (Previously, such labels were shown only to people who
searched for the account.) YouTube declined to answer questions about
Chinese state media. Spokeswoman Elena Hernandez said the company does
fact-check misinformation and that it prohibits content that minimizes,
trivializes, or denies the existence of well-documented, violent
historical events. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to
a request for comment. China and Russia have long been allies, extending
back to the Cold War, and view their alliance as a bulwark against
Western power. The two countries strengthened their bond ahead of the
Ukraine invasion, issuing a joint statement on Feb. 4 describing their
relationship as a "no limits" friendship. Russia has refused to
acknowledge the invasion, referring to its actions in Ukraine as a
"special operation." Chinese state media immediately adopted that term,
according to the Alliance for Securing Democracy's tracker, with Chinese
accounts using it 180 times between Feb. 24 and March 12. The term
"invasion" was mentioned 145 times, but more than the third were
references to the U.S. invasion of Iraq --- an attempt to equate Russian
and American military actions. [*Silicon Valley companies have been
rewriting their rules during the war in Ukraine. Russia is
retaliating.*](about:blank) Chinese media also began to take up neo-Nazi
storylines, according to ASD. Chinese diplomats and state media have
tweeted about Nazis more than 140 times since the start of the war,
according to the tracker. In the year preceding the war, Chinese state-
affiliated accounts tracked by the group tweeted about Nazis only twice.
The Azov Battalion, a group partially made up of anti-Russian
nationalists and neo-Nazis, has been part of Ukraine's military since
2014. But experts say the [controversial battalion](about:blank) does
not have major influence in the country whose president, Zelensky, is
Jewish. Lately[, [China has focused more attention on blaming NATO for
the conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} researchers say. A
recent Facebook post from T-House, a millennial-focused outlet, compared
Ukraine's potential membership in NATO to Hitler's attempt to conquer
Ukraine, according to research by the Center for Countering Digital
Hate. "The moves by the US-led #NATO have pushed the #Russia-Ukraine
tension to the breaking point," said a recent tweet by China's
ambassador to the Asia-Pacific region.In late March, NATO was the tenth
most used key phrase in Chinese tweets, according to the ASD tracker.
Meanwhile, China's consul general in Belfast recently tweeted a false
claim from Russian state media that Zelensky is hiding in Poland, a NATO
member. China also is giving a boost to Russian presenters whose
audiences appear to have been limited by Western bans. The personal talk
show for U.K. presenter George Galloway, host of the "Mother of All Talk
Shows" on Sputnik, been shared numerous times by several large Chinese
outlets such as Global Times. Currently, the Sputnik website that hosted
Galloway's show appeared to be blocked in the United Kingdom, according
to ASD. But his personal YouTube channel, which does not make visible
references to his Sputnik backing, continues to stream it. Galloway did
not respond to a request for comment. In a tweet on Wednesday, Galloway
tweeted in response to Twitter's decision to label his account "Russian
state media," saying, "Dear [\@TwitterSuppor](about:blank)t I am not
"Russian State Affiliated media". I work for NO [#Russian](about:blank)
media. I have 400,000 followers. I'm the leader of a British political
party and spent nearly 30 years in the British parliament. If you do not
remove this designation I will take legal action." Experts disagree
about how the tech companies should police China and other Russian
proxies. The tech companies have cast their crackdowns on Russian media
as [drastic actions](about:blank) taken under extraordinary
circumstances; they largely do not want to impose blanket bans on state
outlets. Experts also have noted that if state outlets are banned for
disinformation, the tech companies would face increasing pressure to ban
nonstate channels that spread misinformation, such as Fox News. Instead,
the tech companies more recently have opted for transparency, such as
fact-checking and labeling. In 2018, YouTube began labeling state media
outlets. Twitter did so in 2020, as did Facebook. But labeling is
premised on the idea that informed users will make wise decisions about
whether to trust content, and that has had mixed results. In 2020,
George Washington University researchers studying the impact of YouTube
labels on content from RT found that they were effective at making
people more aware of misinformation, but only when the labels were
prominently displayed. A separate study from the Election Integrity
Partnership, a consortium of prominent disinformation researchers, found
that labeling was inconsistent and that tech platforms failed to
prominently show the labels in search results. Since the Ukraine war
began, Twitter has added more prominent labels, saying the move has
reduced the reach of Russian propaganda by 30 percent. But some
[advocates said [transparency measures are insufficient in the face of
China's global disinformation campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}, and called
on the tech giants to do more. "When there is clear disinformation
targeted at foreign populations, the tech companies have a perfectly
legitimate moral case for limiting or removing that propaganda," said
Imran Ahmed, chief executive of CCDH, which has researched Chinese state
media. [*Pro-Russia rebels are still using Facebook to recruit fighters,
spread propaganda*](about:blank) Not all companies have embraced the
same level of transparency. TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is
Chinese-owned, started its first pilot project to label a few dozen
Russian state outlets last month, and the company has plans to start
labeling Chinese outlets. Researchers say state propaganda probably has
a massive presence on its service --- but it is difficult to detect with
such limited labels and without providing researchers the ability to
review the platform's data. The company [says](about:blank) it is still
developing a state media policy. Rather than adopting ad hoc policies
during an emergency like the Ukraine war, platforms should have
distinguished long ago between media outlets run by authoritarian
governments and outlets, such as PBS or the BBC, that receive support
from democratic governments, said Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford
Internet Observatory, which is a member of the Election Integrity
Partnership. Stamos, who once was Facebook's chief security officer,
argued that social media companies should not give a megaphone to state
media outlets from countries, such as China, where free speech is
suppressed. Russia would now also fall into that category, he said.
"This is the time,\" Stamos said, "for the tech platforms to finally
create rules about state media run by authoritarian governments."

#### China is using info-warfare tactics to make invading Taiwan easier- US counter-info warfare key to prevent invasion

Can the People's Republic of China (PRC) invade and conquer Taiwan?
Experts differ, but the current debate considers only the military
balance---and whether the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has the
weapons, hardware, and capabilities to get ashore, defeat Taiwan's
military, and force Taipei to surrender. The military match-up is
important, but it misses half the picture---and half of the PRC's
strategy against Taiwan. Professor Kerry Gershaneck's new book, Media
Warfare: Taiwan's Battle for the Cognitive Domain, details and explains
a key portion of that "other half": the **[[PRC's use of "media warfare"
to psychologically fracture and demoralize Taiwan and make conquest
easier or, even better, to have Taiwan surrender without a
fight]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Gershaneck knows the topic well. He has
vast Asia experience and hands-on strategic communications experience at
all levels of the U.S. government, as well as a particularly useful
counterintelligence background. In 2020, he published a seminal work on
PRC Political Warfare: Political Warfare: Strategies for Combating
China's plan to "Win without Fighting" In this book, Gershaneck focuses
on what China has done and is doing to Taiwan on the media warfare
front. Importantly, he lays out [how [Beijing is waging the same type of
insidious warfare worldwide---especially against T]{.mark}aiwan's main
"ally," [the United States]{.mark}.]{.underline} To Chinese strategists,
media warfare and political warfare are just as important as building
the PLA into a force able to defeat the U.S. military. Indeed, the
kinetic and the "informational" are considered mutually reinforcing
lines of attack. Media warfare, also known as Public Opinion Warfare,
leverages all instruments that inform and influence an adversary's
public and government opinion. The objective is to weaken, divide,
corrode, confuse, co-opt, and demoralize an opponent. What are the
instruments? Beyond the old standards such as television, radio, and
newspapers, there are also books, textbooks, and, over the past three
decades, the Internet and social media. Indeed, the Chinese Communists
make full use of all of these and are particularly aggressive on the
internet/social media vectors. This makes sense. With TV, radio, and
newspapers, a propagandist must somehow lure the intended target to
receive the message. With social media and the Internet, it is possible
to "jam" the message into the target non-stop. And given that 90 percent
of Taiwan's public is active on social media, that democracy presents a
particularly target-rich environment. What does the PRC's media warfare
campaign against Taiwan look like? To deliver its messages, [[Chinese
entities have bought Taiwanese broadcasting outlets and
newspapers]{.mark}, and use the lure of advertising dollars against
"independent" outlets.]{.underline} Another key part of the effort to
influence the widest audience is the aggressive use of social media
platforms to affect, confuse, and deceive, often through effective
profiling of users to better target messaging. How successful has
Beijing been? In 2018, the PRC deployed media warfare
stratagems---including heavy use of social media---to engineer the
election of an absolute "nobody": Kuomintang Party (KMT) candidate Han
Kuo-yu---as the mayor of Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second-largest city. Many
in the KMT support Communist China's plans to annex Taiwan. The surprise
election of Han to this powerful mayorship was no small feat and no
minor issue: Kaohsiung has historically been a stronghold of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that firmly opposes annexation by
China. As part of the effort to elect Han, pro-Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) media in Taiwan and the communist propaganda organs in China
relentlessly attacked DPP leadership, including President Tsai Ing-wen,
with disinformation and untrue allegations. [That [relentless campaign
interference was enough to raise doubts with voters]{.mark}, especially
because there were [no effective means in Taiwan to detect and counter
the media warfare attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}. Han ran for president
two years later, once again with pro-CCP Taiwanese and Communist
China-based "media warriors" hard at work on his behalf. Han had a fair
shot at winning had not two things happened. First, Taiwan's government
woke up to the media warfare threat and cobbled together effective
enough defenses to derail and expose Beijing's strategy. Second, the
Chinese Communist crushing of Hong Kong's pro-freedom movement a few
months before Taiwan's election awakened a huge chunk of Taiwan's public
to the Chinese threat---and inoculated many to Chinese subversion.
Gershaneck provides a concise, yet detailed introduction to media
warfare in Taiwan, but with larger implications. He walks the reader
through the confusing and redundant terminology and explains how media
warfare fits into the larger Chinese political warfare
strategy---intended to defeat an enemy via all measures short of
outright kinetic warfare. While using Taiwan as the focus of his latest
book, Gershaneck emphasizes that what the PRC is doing to Taiwan it is
also doing to the United States and other free nations. Gershaneck wrote
his most recent book to help Western nations "better detect, deter,
counter, and defeat" Chinese media warfare---and political warfare writ
large. And he provides a set of practical recommendations for Taiwan's
government that are applicable to any country under PRC media warfare
attack. For example, Chinese state-controlled media (which is every
media entity operating in China) has formed strategic alliances with
western media. The New York Times, Washington Post, and even the
"conservative" and "tough on China" Wall Street Journal carried China
Daily media warfare inserts for several years. Gershaneck also describes
how the Chinese government takes control of newspapers and broadcast
media serving the Chinese "diaspora" in many, if not most, countries. At
the same time, not only does the PRC flood the United States with
"reporters" but it makes life miserable in China for the few foreign
reporters still allowed to operate there. U.S. and other foreign outlets
routinely self-censor to avoid angering Beijing. Gershaneck paints a
grim picture of China's massive, well-funded, and effective media
warfare effort against Taiwan, and worldwide. Yet, many---if not
most---people will say they are too smart, too well educated, and too
discerning to be influenced by Chinese Communist Party media warfare.
Maybe so. But if you've ever said or thought any of the following,
you've been "influenced." -Covid-19 couldn\'t possibly have come from a
laboratory. -China wants to "reunify" with Taiwan. -The United States
must have China's help on climate change, North Korea, etc. -We simply
have to be invested in the China market. -To make China an enemy, treat
it like one. -China is no longer communist. It is capitalist. -China's
rise is "peaceful" and "inevitable." -China has never attacked its
neighbors. -China is not expansionist. -China is just doing what all
great powers do. Gershaneck's book is indeed alarming---though one
grudgingly admires China's industriousness and persistence on the
"non-kinetic" media/public opinion/psychological fronts. But
[[certainly, the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} Government [[has its own
media warfare and political warfare effort to match and defeat whatever
Beijing is doing]{.underline}]{.mark}? [If
[onl]{.underline}]{.mark}[y]{.underline}. Unlike previous
administrations, the Trump administration understood the problem, and
also understood China's political warfare efforts. It had some limited
success exposing and cracking down here and there---with Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo (to whom the book is dedicated) and Deputy National
Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger being particularly effective. But
they ran out of time. The [U[.S. Government is]{.underline}]{.mark} once
again back to [[doing nothing while China runs]{.underline} wild in
the]{.mark} crucial [["cognitive" battlefield]{.underline}]{.mark} that
Gershaneck explains so well in this important book. This isn't
surprising, one supposes. The recent collapse of the Afghan government
and military was as much a political warfare victory for the Taliban as
a military victory. The U.S. military and civilian leadership didn't
seem to notice. **[[One hopes they take China's media and political
warfare threat more seriously.]{.underline}]{.mark}** And then do
something about it.

#### US-NATO cooperation on Chinese cyberthreats key to deter Chinese invasion of Taiwan 

**Odgaard 22** Liselotte Odgaard- professor at the Norwegian Institute
for Defense Studies . Her work focuses on US--China--Europe relations,
including NATO--China relations; Chinese foreign, security and defense
policy; Indo-Pacific security, and the geopolitics of the Arctic region.
(2022) NATO's China Role: Defending Cyber and Outer Space, The
Washington Quarterly, 45:1, 167-183, DOI: 10.1080/0163660X.2022.2059145

NATO's vague recognition in 2021 that China constitutes a challenge to
the transatlantic alliance reflects an institution that has failed to
take on the security threats emanating from Beijing. Russia's invasion
of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 highlights the reasons why this omission
is problematic. The war in Ukraine has reignited transatlantic unity of
purpose in addressing threats from Moscow toward European security.
[[The existential shock that Europe is facing]{.mark} now that a Russian
regime has shown itself willing to go to war against European countries
carries with it the risk [that China will be
forgotten]{.mark}]{.underline} when NATO discusses its future
priorities. During the war, China is walking a tightrope between
maintaining its commitment to sovereignty and territorial integrity and
keeping up cooperation with Russia. The future strength of the
Chinese-Russian partnership is likely to be determined by the continued
usefulness of Moscow in China's efforts to carve out more space for a
Sinocentric international order based on authoritarian regimes.
Meanwhile, [China will continue to engender threats to the US and Europe
in all domains and across geographical regions]{.underline}. With the
summit statement of the North Atlantic Council released June 14, 2021,
NATO extended a commitment to "engage China with a view to defending the
security interests of the Alliance," since "China's stated ambitions and
assertive behavior present systemic challenges to the rules-based
international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security."1
China's coercive policies, nuclear arsenal, military modernization,
military cooperation with Russia, lack of transparency, and use of
disinformation are listed as main areas of concern for the alliance.
NATO takes the China challenge seriously but has yet to devise a
strategy to address it. NATO takes the China challenge seriously but has
yet to devise a strategy to address it Compared to the United States,
Europe took a long time to acknowledge its stake in managing security
challenges from China. As Beijing pushed beyond its traditional zones of
interest in East and Southeast Asia toward the Indian Ocean in the
2000s, US security policies began to focus more on China as Washington
sought a new geopolitical equilibrium in Asia.2 Since 2014, France and
the UK have spearheaded Europe's naval diplomacy to counter the displays
of force and increasing tensions in maritime Asia to which China
contributes. This engagement has focused on regular exercises with the
US and its Asian allies, operations in support of freedom of navigation,
and base-sharing agreements.3 In 2021, the EU recognized that these
geopolitical dynamics directly impact its security and announced the
establishment of supportive mechanisms in its Indo-Pacific strategy.4
However, [[NATO has been]{.mark} conspicuously [absent in these
transatlantic endeavors]{.mark} designed [to counter challenges to US
and European securit]{.mark}y]{.underline}. Reflecting NATO's absence
from the main arena of US-China strategic competition, the alliance is
hardly ever mentioned in off-the-record conversations on Indo-Pacific
security between diplomats and think tank personnel. NATO's reluctance
to take on the China challenge is perhaps not surprising, given its
inherent assumption that the European continent is the jewel in the
crown of the US alliance system, which is thought to guarantee US
assistance in the event of a military threat against Europe. This
assumption was challenged during the Trump administration, which openly
questioned the US commitment to Article Five's collective defense
obligation. The invasion of Ukraine has given NATO a new lease on life
and put it at the frontlines of transatlantic cooperation on deterring
Russia from further military action in future. However, [[NATO's focus
on its eastern frontline]{.mark} carries the risk that the alliance
turns into a Russia-focused European institution and [ignores that China
is a global great power competitor]{.mark}]{.underline} which also
constitutes a major challenge to the security of all NATO member states.
[Washington increasingly looks to the EU rather than NATO for guidance
on Europe's future security policy]{.underline}. One reason is that
[[NATO's toolbox is lagging in]{.mark}]{.underline} domains such as
[[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} and outer space, although cyber and outer
space operations are key enablers of actions in all domains including
air, sea, and land. One indication of this is the US-EU negotiations
surrounding a common response to cyber threats which took place during
the first US-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) meeting in Pittsburgh
in September 2021. In addition, during Trump's presidency, longstanding
US dissatisfaction with Europe's modest defense spending threatened to
put NATO on the backburner in transatlantic security debates.5 Since
then, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has elicited a sea change in German
defense policy with the announcement in February 2022 that defense
spending will increase to more than 2 percent of its gross domestic
output annually.6 [While this may be a convincing signal that Europe
will finally devote the resources required for its own defense and
revive NATO's central role in transatlantic security, there is also a
risk that China will be moved to the periphery of the alliance's
agenda]{.underline}. On February 11, 2022, during the runup to the
Russian-Ukrainian war, the Biden administration published its
Indo-Pacific strategy as US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken was in
the midst of a Pacific trip to Australia, Fiji, and Hawaii.7 This US
prioritization signaled that despite Moscow's war in Europe, Washington
remains committed to strengthening its presence in the Indo-Pacific and
competing with China. **[[If the US drops the ball on the Indo-Pacific,
Washington is concerned that China might use force against
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**.8 Consequently, the key question for the
US is how many resources can be tied up in Europe without losing sight
of the long-term goal: deterrence of China. As US strategic competition
with China increases while NATO is sitting on the fence, **[[failure to
develop a transatlantic defense policy that addresses China will leave
Europe vulnerable]{.mark} to China's ability to exploit the weak links
in European defense arrangements, which are newly fragmented by the
Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}**.9 EU efforts to build an
independent regional defense profile and nurture cooperation between
Europe's defense industry and national defense communities reflect a
growing recognition that the region needs to become a self-reliant
defense actor. However, Europe still needs to demonstrate that
self-reliance does not imply merely focusing on Europe's periphery.
[Otherwise, the [industrial challenges from China may outcompete
Europe's defense industry]{.mark}]{.underline}. Shipbuilding is a case
in point. By 2021, China built 50 percent of all existing ships in the
world. Through design collaboration agreements, cyber espionage, and
acquisitions, China has copied advanced innovative ship designs.
Enormous financial resources from the state allow Chinese companies to
enjoy economies of scale by building dual-use factories which not only
outcompete Western companies in the commercial shipbuilding industry,
but also threaten the production of navy vessels. If not taken
seriously, Europe and the US may soon have no choice but to buy frigates
from China.10 This example demonstrates the [centrality of China for
global economic and security developments and should encourage Europe to
manifest a position of unified strength in defending NATO member states
against Chinese security challenges]{.underline}. This realization will
help convince the US and its adversaries that Europe continues to be a
credible partner in countering common threats against transatlantic
security, whether they appear in or beyond the European region.
[[China's challenges to US and European security]{.underline}]{.mark}
constitute such common threats across a broad range of sectors. [These
[include]{.mark} gradual [reinterpretations of]{.mark} principles of
[i]{.mark}nternational [l]{.mark}aw, the [subversion of]{.mark}
universal [liberal market]{.mark} economic practices, [and cyber
insurgencies]{.mark} targeting a wide range of civilian and military
entities.]{.underline} These Chinese policies all have major military
implications because they are related to developments in the operating
principles, capabilities, and priorities of China's armed forces. [[Only
NATO can offer an integrated transatlantic response to the military
aspects of Chinese policies]{.underline}]{.mark} that threaten those
sectors across the globe, including European actors. NATO's involvement
is essential if the credibility of the alliance's security guarantees is
to be preserved [[and an effective response to China's encroachments on
a liberal rules-based order]{.underline}]{.mark} is to be established.
NATO's involvement is essential to establish an effective response to
China The omnipresent character of the China threat demonstrates that it
is long overdue for NATO to position itself as a significant player in
addressing Beijing's challenges to transatlantic security. NATO is key
to keeping US and European security policies coordinated when applying
mechanisms of deterrence and defense against Chinese challenges. If
transatlantic unity of purpose is lost, both the US and Europe are far
less likely to succeed in addressing China sufficiently.

#### China-Taiwan war goes nuclear. Deterrence is key. It's fast and more probable than European war.

Taiwan Could Go Nuclear," *Foreign Affairs*,

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised the specter of nuclear
war]{.underline}, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed his
nuclear forces at an elevated state of alert and has warned that any
effort by outside parties to interfere in the war would result in
"consequences you have never seen." [Such saber-rattling has
understandably made headlines and drawn notice in Washington. But if
China attempted to forcibly invade Taiwan]{.underline} and the United
States came to Taipei's aid, [the **threat of escalation could
outstrip** even the current nerve-wracking situation in
Europe]{.underline}. A recent war game, conducted by the Center for a
New American Security in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the
Press," demonstrated just how quickly such a conflict could escalate.
The game posited a fictional crisis set in 2027, with the aim of
examining how the United States and China might act under a certain set
of conditions. The game demonstrated that [China's military
modernization and expansion of its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}---not to
mention the importance Beijing places on unification with Taiwan---[mean
that, in the real world, a fight between China and the United States
could very well go nuclear]{.underline}. [Beijing views Taiwan as a
breakaway republic. If the Chinese Communist Party decides to invade the
island, its leaders may not be able to accept failure]{.underline}
without seriously harming the regime's legitimacy. [Thus, the CCP might
be willing to take significant risks to ensure that the conflict ends on
terms that it finds acceptable]{.underline}. That would mean convincing
the United States and its allies that the costs of defending Taiwan are
so high that it is not worth contesting the invasion. While China has
several ways to achieve that goal, [from Beijing's perspective, using
nuclear weapons may be the most effective]{.underline} means to keep the
United States out of the conflict. China is several decades into
transforming its People's Liberation Army (PLA) into what the Chinese
President Xi Jinping has called a "world-class military" that could
defeat any third party that comes to Taiwan's defense. China's
warfighting strategy, known as "anti-access/area denial," rests on being
able to project conventional military power out several thousand miles
in order to prevent the American military, in particular, from
effectively countering a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Meanwhile, [a growing
nuclear arsenal provides Beijing with coercive leverage as well as
potentially new warfighting capabilities, which could increase the risks
of war and escalation]{.underline}. China has historically possessed
only a few hundred ground-based nuclear weapons. But last year, nuclear
scholars at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and the
Federation of American Scientists identified three missile silo fields
under construction in the Xinjiang region. The Financial Times reported
that China might have carried out tests of hypersonic gliders as a part
of an orbital bombardment system that could evade missile defenses and
deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the continental United States. The
U.S. Department of Defense projects that by 2030, China will have around
1,000 deliverable warheads---more than triple the number it currently
possesses. Based on these projections, Chinese leaders may believe that
as early as five years from now the PLA will have made enough
conventional and nuclear gains that it could fight and win a war to
unify with Taiwan. [Our recent war game]{.underline}---in which members
of Congress, former government officials, and subject matter experts
assumed the roles of senior national security decision makers in China
and the United States---[illustrated that a U.S.-Chinese war could
escalate quickly]{.underline}. For one thing, it showed that [both
countries would face operational incentives to strike military forces on
the other's territory]{.underline}. In the game, such strikes were
intended to be calibrated to avoid escalation; both sides tried to walk
a fine line by attacking only military targets. But [such attacks
crossed red lines for both countries, and produced a **tit-for-tat cycle
of attacks that broadened the scope and intensity of the
conflict**]{.underline}. For instance, in the simulation, China launched
a preemptive attack against key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region.
The attacks targeted Guam, in particular, because it is a forward
operating base critical to U.S. military operations in Asia, and because
since it is a territory, and not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed
striking it as less escalatory than attacking other possible targets. In
response, the United States targeted Chinese military ships in ports and
surrounding facilities, but refrained from other attacks on the Chinese
mainland. Nevertheless, both sides perceived these strikes as attacks on
their home territory, crossing an important threshold. Instead of
mirror-imaging their own concerns about attacks on their territory, each
side justified the initial blows as military necessities that were
limited in nature and would be seen by the other as such. Responses to
the initial strikes only escalated things further as the U.S. team
responded to China's moves by hitting targets in mainland China, and the
Chinese team responded to Washington's strikes by attacking sites in
Hawaii. A NEW ERA One particularly alarming finding from the war game is
that China found it necessary to threaten to go nuclear from the start
in order to ward off outside support for Taiwan. This threat was
repeated throughout the game, particularly after mainland China had been
attacked. At times, efforts to erode Washington's will so that it would
back down from the fight received greater attention by the China team
than the invasion of Taiwan itself. But China had difficulty convincing
the United States that its nuclear threats were credible. In real life,
China's significant and recent changes to its nuclear posture and
readiness may impact other nations' views, as its nuclear threats may
not be viewed as credible given its stated doctrine of no first use, its
smaller but burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of experience making
nuclear threats. This may push China to preemptively detonate a nuclear
weapon to reinforce the credibility of its warning. [China might also
resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might because of constraints on
its long-range conventional strike capabilities]{.underline}. Five years
from now, the PLA still will have a very limited ability to launch
conventional attacks beyond locations in the "second island chain" in
the Pacific; namely, Guam and Palau. Unable to strike the U.S. homeland
with conventional weapons, China would struggle to impose costs on the
American people. Up until a certain point in the game, the U.S. team
felt its larger nuclear arsenal was sufficient to deter escalation and
did not fully appreciate the seriousness of China's threats. As a
result, China felt it needed to escalate significantly to send a message
that the U.S. homeland could be at risk if Washington did not back down.
Despite China's stated "no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game
resulted in Beijing detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii
as a demonstration. The attack caused relatively little destruction, as
the electromagnetic pulse only damaged the electronics of ships in the
immediate vicinity but did not directly impact the U.S. state. The war
game ended before the U.S. team could respond, but it is likely that the
first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II would have provoked a
response. The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in a fight between
the United States and China are different from those that were most
likely during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and the United States
feared a massive, bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack, which would
precipitate a full-scale strategic exchange. In a confrontation over
Taiwan, however, Beijing could employ nuclear weapons in a more limited
way to signal resolve or to improve its chances of winning on the
battlefield. It is unclear how a war would proceed after that kind of
limited nuclear use and whether the United States could de-escalate the
situation while still achieving its objectives. AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION
[The clear lesson from the war game is that the United States needs to
**strengthen**]{.underline} its [**conventional capabilities** in the
Indo-Pacific to ensure that China **never views an invasion of Taiwan as
a prudent tactical move**]{.underline}. To do so, the United States will
need to commit to maintaining its conventional military superiority by
expanding its stockpiles of long-range munitions and investing in
undersea capabilities. Washington must also be able to conduct offensive
operations inside the first and second island chains even while under
attack. This will require access to new bases to distribute U.S. forces,
enhance their survivability, and ensure that they can effectively defend
Taiwan in the face of China's attacks. Moreover, [the United States
needs to]{.underline} develop an integrated network of partners willing
to **[contribute to Taiwan's defense]{.underline}**. Allies are an
asymmetric advantage: the United States has them, and China does not.
[The United States should **deepen strategic and operational planning**
with key partners to **send a strong signal of resolve** to
China]{.underline}. As part of these planning efforts, the United States
and its allies will need to develop war-winning military strategies that
do not cross Chinese red-lines. The game highlighted just how difficult
this task may be; what it did not highlight is the complexity of
developing military strategies that integrate the strategic objectives
and military capacities of multiple nations. Moving forward, military
planners in the United States and in Washington's allies and partners
must grapple with the fact that, in a conflict over Taiwan, China would
consider all conventional and nuclear options to be on the table. And
[the United States is **running out of time** to strengthen deterrence
and keep China from believing an invasion of Taiwan could be successful.
**The biggest risk** is that Washington and its friends choose not to
seize the moment and act: **a year or two from now**, it might already
be too late]{.underline}.

expert Kevin Mandia ," CNBC,
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/iran-leapfrogging-our-defenses-in-cyber-war-hacking-expert-mandia-.html

On Thursday, [a [federal]{.mark} grand [jury indicted]{.mark} two
[**Iranian hackers** for **election interference**]{.mark}]{.underline}
that included [[obtaining]{.mark} confidential voter
[info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} from at least one state's election
website [[for a]{.mark} **[cyber]{.mark}-based [disinformation
campaign]{.mark}** targeting 100,000 Americans]{.underline}. Earlier
this week, [the U.S. government warned]{.underline} that [[Iranian
hackers]{.mark} also [have been on]{.mark} the **[ransomware
offensive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To Kevin Mandia, the CEO of
cybersecurity firm Mandiant, [[Iran]{.mark}'s success in the hacking
realm is no surprise]{.underline}, as [the nation]{.underline} has been
[[upping its]{.mark} **[cyber-offensive
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} for years [to take advantage of U.S.
weaknesses]{.underline}. [[Iran]{.mark} has progressed]{.underline} well
beyond the first few stages of **[[cyber
evolution]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [defending its government in
cyberspace]{.underline} and [targeting its closest geographic
foes]{.underline}, the immediate threats, which in Iran's case would
include [the back and forth between itself and Israel in the cyber
realm]{.underline}. "There was a time when we responded to Iran, their
operators looked like they just got out of the classroom," Mandia said
during an interview with CNBC's Eamon Javers at the CNBC Technology
Executive Council Summit in New York City on Wednesday. "And we're like
god, you know \... they just compressed the C drive, why not just
compress what you're going to steal?" "But that was 14 years ago," said
Mandia, who has been monitoring cyber campaigns by Iran since 2008.
"Come today, [they're **[operating with
efficiency]{.mark}**]{.underline}, they're operating [with **malware**
that can be updated]{.underline}. They have a framework where they can
update their malware super fast," he said. "So they can be very
efficient \... [**[leapfrogging]{.mark}** our **[defenses]{.mark}** as
they learn]{.underline}. And that's kind of a frustration. I've seen
most modern nations do have that capability \...a framework where they
can update quickly. Iran does have that framework." He said
[Iran]{.underline} also [is part of a group of nation-state actors that
[have **zero day capabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- referring to a
disclosed vulnerability for which no official patches or security
updates yet exist even though exploitation by hackers can have severe
consequences --- the most frustrating of all types of cyberattacks.
"Russia, Iran, Israel, China, they all have zero day components and zero
day capability, whether they develop themselves or buy from someone,
Iran's gone through that rites of passage is well," said Mandia, whose
firm was the first to warn the U.S. government about the SolarWinds hack
last year, the largest-ever attack on a software supply chain hitting
both government agencies and private enterprise. The U.S. government
alleges Russia was behind the hacking group that pulled off the
cyberattack. Mandia, who served in the U.S. Air Force, said [the
nation's physical military assets are ahead of its cyber
assets]{.underline}, and there is no clear advantage in the real of
cyber warfare. "[In the cyber domain, [we **don't have
dominance**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said. A U.S. workforce that is
increasingly deployed on a global scale, as well as our early adoption
of the internet economy and its evolution, all contribute to increased
vulnerabilities as geopolitical rivals become more sophisticated in the
cyber realm. Even if the U.S. has the best zero day capabilities, the
nature of cyber warfare doesn't favor a win for the U.S., he said. "My
gut is we lose, because we're in a glass house attacking mud huts. It's
just too asymmetric. And I don't want to liken another country's economy
to a mud hut. But I'm saying [in the cyber domain]{.underline}, the
asymmetry, I think [more [people are **taking advantage** of the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, and our openness]{.underline}. \... In
my opinion, [cyberattacks are also **more effective** against United
States than against other nations]{.underline}."

[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} is playing dirty tricks in and around the
Strait of Hormuz. To begin with, they [are]{.underline} **[[jamming the
GPS of tankers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [causing ships to wander off

also]{.underline} **[[spoofing]{.mark} andradioing the

mixing and matching partial truths with outright lies in order to
advance their agenda]{.underline}. They want to convince global
observers that it is the Iranian leadership who are the innocent
victims, innocent victims targeted by organized Western aggression. In
this case [Iranians are deliberately]{.underline} dogging, misleading
and **[[luring ships off course]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Their
[actions]{.mark} have [turned into]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[a war of
jamming]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Like most everything else they engage
in, for Iran this is serious business. [Globally this is]{.underline}
**[[extremely dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [We are seeing
signs]{.underline} **[all over the Mideast]{.underline}**. The U.S.
Department of Transportation Maritime Division published a public
warning to all ships and companies traveling in the region alerting them
that [Iran]{.underline} \"[spoofed bridge-to-bridge communications from
unknown entities falsely claiming to be U.S. or coalition
warships]{.underline}.\" U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a
statement, \"[Due to the heightened regional tensions]{.underline},
**[the potential for [miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}** or
misidentification **[[could lead to aggressive
actions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [against vessels belonging to US,

**[Arabian Gulf]{.underline}**, **[Strait of Hormuz]{.underline}**,
**[and Gulf of Oman]{.underline}** . . . **[GPS
[interference]{.mark}]{.underline}**, bridge-to-bridge communications
**[[spoofing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.mark}/or other
communications [jamming]{.mark} with little to no

speak to one another. [[Iran has]{.mark} been
[become]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[expert]{.underline}**]{.mark} [at
jamming]{.underline}. That shouldn't come as a big surprise given that
as far back as 2012 the Iranian government has been jamming their own
citizens. Back then, Iran replaced a series of short flagpoles scattered
around their country with huge flagpoles -- all the better to hide their
jamming devices. The newer, taller, flagpoles sprouted up almost
everywhere. The Iranian regime was attempting to stop all forms of
social media and messaging. Their citizens were using satellites to
communicate and find out the truth about what was happening in the world
and that was not what Iranian leadership wanted. [The]{.underline}
**[Russians]{.underline}**, too, [have become]{.underline} **[very good
at GPS jamming]{.underline}**. Intelligence analysts report that [Russia
is jamming not waterways, but airspace, specifically the airspace
around]{.underline} **[Syria]{.underline}**. [And that means that Russia
is now capable of jamming communication for the **new US stealth fighter
jet, the F-35**]{.underline}. This may be an exaggeration -I am
skeptical that Russia is that sophisticated. Even more worrisome than
all of this is a report that was issued this summer by the International
Federation of Airline Pilots Association. The report details that
pilots, landing in Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport in Israel, have lost
GPS and that it is a recurring phenomenon. Thankfully, there are
alternative tools that can be used to land and take off. Israel has said
that they are dealing with the issue. But [the mere presence of this
issue demonstrates that we now live in a world hampered]{.underline} ---
**[dangerously so]{.underline}**, **[by a significant threat of
jamming]{.underline}**. [And this jamming can and is affecting more than
ships at sea and military drones and jets in the sky, it is also
targeting civilian aircraft with hundreds of civilian passengers
aboard]{.underline}. When it comes to tech, Iran is highly skilled. They
are developing their own tools and are using and adapting Russian and
North Korean tech. **[Jamming]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[spoofing by Iran]{.underline}** [explains quite a lot of what has
been happening in the Strait of Hormuz]{.underline}. [Iran does not play
games for fun]{.underline}. And this time, as always, [the [Iranians are

nuclear strike [for the following reasons]{.underline}: [The sanction
regime]{.underline} set against the Iranian economy [is so brutal that
it is likely to force Iran to take an action that will require a US
military response]{.underline}. Unless the United States backs down from
its present self-declared "economic warfare" against Iran, this will
likely escalate to an open warfare between the two countries. In
response to a White House request to draw up an Iran war plan, the
Pentagon proposed sending 120,000 soldiers to the Persian Gulf. This
force would augment the several thousands of troops already stationed in
Iran's vicinity. President Trump has also hinted that if need be, he
will be sending "a lot more" troops. Defeating Iran through conventional
military means would likely require a half million US forces and US
preparedness for many casualties. The US nuclear posture review is
worded in such a way that the use of tactical nuclear weapons in
conventional theaters is envisaged, foreshadowing the concern that in a
showdown with a menacing foe like Iran, the nuclear option is on the
table. The United States could once again justify using nuclear force
for the sake of a decisive victory and casualty-prevention, the logic
used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. [Trump's]{.underline} **[cavalier
attitude toward nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, **[trigger-happy
penchant]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[utter disdain for

[**[No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea's **[cyberattacks]{.mark}**

[targeted S]{.mark}ony** Pictures]{.underline}, seemingly [[in
**retal**]{.mark}iation for a satirical movie about North Korean leader
Kim Jong Un]{.underline}. But the reclusive regime's [[greatly
**improved cybercapabilities**]{.mark} are not a joke]{.underline}.
They're [a serious [threat to]{.mark} the stability of the **global
[econ]{.mark}omy** [and **critical infrastructure**]{.mark}
systems]{.underline}. North [Korean hackers have gone on to **bigger**
and more **financially profitable** targets]{.underline}. Since 2014,
North Korean [[hackers]{.mark} have [attacked]{.mark} Bangladesh's
**[central bank]{.mark}**, the U.K. National **[Health
Service]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark}]{.underline}, more recently,
[**[crypto]{.mark}currency** exchanges]{.underline}. And the odds are
that many more major North Korean cyberattacks are to come in the near
future. In internal regime discourse, Pyongyang proudly refers to its
cyberoperations as its "all-purpose sword." According to testimony from
a South Korean intelligence chief, Kim reportedly stated:
"[Cyberwarfare, along with nuclear weapons and missiles, is an
'all-purpose sword' that guarantees our military's capability to strike
relentlessly]{.underline}." Subversive, criminal operations are a style
of asymmetric warfare long embraced by the North. The country's founding
leader, Kim Il Sung, earned his nationalist credentials by fighting
Japanese colonialists in the 1930s. His guerrilla band later became the
political elite of the North Korean state. During the Cold War era, Kim
regularly deployed guerrillas to subvert and instigate the South Korean
government. [North Koreas hackers are the 21st-century version of
guerrilla fighters]{.underline}, moving in the dark and striking at the
most vulnerable points. Historically, guerrillas often depended on
banditry and robbery to survive---and [one reason for the recent amping
up of cyberattacks is financial worries]{.underline}. While Kim Jong
Un's recent missile tests garner international condemnation and
head-shaking in Washington and Seoul, Pyongyang's cyberoperatives work
in the shadows. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, North Korean borders have
been sealed shut for the past two years. North Korean trade with China
has largely stalled, and many foreign diplomats have left the country,
making the already reclusive state even more isolated. Nonetheless,
North Korean hackers work diligently in an effort to bolster the
depleted coffers of the party elite. Between 2011 and 2020,
[**[No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea [**cybercriminals** stole]{.mark}
more than **[\$1 billion]{.mark}** worth of
**[crypto]{.mark}currency**]{.underline}. In 2021, North Korean hackers
allegedly [stole close to **\$400 million** worth of **crypto
coins**]{.underline}. The blockchain analysis company Chainalysis wrote
in a recent report that "North Korean cybercriminals had a banner year
in 2021." The regime's investment in its cyberoperations is likely
providing a vital economic buffer for the isolated and paranoid
leadership. According to an unclassified 2021 report from the U.S.
Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), North Korea's
[cybercrime likely **[funds]{.mark}** "government priorities, such as
its **[nuclear and missile programs]{.mark}**." North Korea is also
[engaged in]{.mark} more **conventional
[espionage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A cybersecurity firm recently
uncovered that the North Korean hacking group [Lazarus used two decoy
Microsoft Word documents that resembled Lockheed Martin employment
information in order to deliver payloads on unsuspecting
users]{.underline}. Using spear-phishing attacks, the Lazarus group has
[**increasingly [targeted]{.mark}** job-seekers in the **[U.S.
defense]{.mark}** and aerospace industries [with]{.mark} fake
[documents]{.mark} that are **[infected with
malware]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Despite relatively good relations
between Pyongyang and Moscow, [North Korean hackers have [even
**targeted Russia**]{.mark}'s foreign ministry **[with
malware]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In what seems to be a counterstrike
against the analysts who uncover their hacking operations, Pyongyang's
cyberagents are using [fake social media profiles to infect the
computers of cybersecurity researchers with custom backdoor
malware]{.underline}. So, why have foreign-policy experts and
policymakers themselves largely ignored North Korea's increasingly
sophisticated cyberoperations? Well, firstly, [cyberattacks are less
obvious than missile tests]{.underline}. Kim's numerous missile tests
are a frequent and unignorable reminder of his regime's nuclear arsenal
and military capabilities. Cyberattacks take place in the dark corners
of the internet and are not always obvious to even the targets.
Secondly, [most [policymakers **struggle**]{.mark} with understanding
that North Korea is a technological peer nation in
cybersecurity]{.underline}. Despite being a deeply impoverished country
with a crumbling health care system and less than 10 percent of its
non-highway roads paved, the North Korean leadership has attained
significant expertise and development in its cybersector. As part of its
militaristic worldview, North Korea prioritizes investment in regime
stability and the defense industry over economic improvement for its
citizens. North Korea's asymmetric capabilities have allowed a nation
with a GDP roughly equivalent to that of Mozambique to be able to
compete with the world superpowers in cyberspace. The stereotype of
North Korea's Kim Jong Un as a buffoonish character on the international
stage has impeded U.S. strategic thinking toward North Korea as a very
real threat in cyberspace. And finally, fearing financial loss and
public relations fiascos, [companies and [businesses are **hesitant to
release info**]{.mark}**rmation** to the public about North Korean
cyberattacks]{.underline}. Since many CEOs solely prioritize their
company's bottom line, details of cyberattacks often get swept under the
rug. In 2016, the FBI's Internal Crime Complaint Center estimated that
only 15 percent of cybertheft victims in the United States reported
their crimes to law enforcement. So, what can be done to bolster
defenses against North Korean hackers? Cyberattacks are part of North
Korea's historical commitment to asymmetric warfare, and it will not
change course no matter how much we publicly condemn its actions.
Rhetoric won't work unless it has teeth. Guerrilla warfare, in
cyberspace and the physical world, has long been embraced by the regime.
[The United States [needs to **address**]{.mark} the role and complicity
of the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party
(**[[CCP]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[in No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea's
**[cyberop]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. From hosting North
Korean cyberunits in border cities such as Shenyang to training them at
Chinese technology universities and research institutes, [the CCP
enables North Korea's **maliciousness** in cyberspace]{.underline}. In
2016, a South Korean cybersecurity researcher estimated that around 600
to 1,000 North Korean cyberwarfare agents operate in China. In addition,
[most, if not all, of the [internet]{.mark} traffic from North Korea
[runs through Chinese]{.mark} access [providers]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Many North Korean hackers get their education in China's tech
universities and then bring back their skills to their homeland. We need
to cut off this supply of North Korean hackers and address the fact that
the Chinese government knowingly enables North Korea's malicious
cyberoperations. In October 2020, John Demers, then the U.S. assistant
attorney general for national security, mentioned at a think tank event
that "there is support through Chinese cyberinfrastructure. There's
likely support in terms of sharing expertise and training from the
Chinese side." Since the U.S. national security apparatus seemingly
acknowledges this Sino-North Korean cyberpartnership, the U.S.
government should sanction the Chinese entities that enable and assist
North Korean cybercrime, such as the Harbin Institute of Technology,
which hosts North Korean computer science students. In 2019, China's
education minister signed an agreement with the North Korean government
on the continuation of educational exchanges and partnerships from 2020
to 2030. The Chinese government will continue to see North Korean
cybercapabilities as a useful proxy force to weaken and frustrate U.S.
interests. Finally, [[U.S.]{.mark} companies and businesses [need to
**share**]{.mark} [**information** about]{.mark} North Korean
[cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline} with the general public so that
others can act to prepare themselves. As noted in the ODNI report,
[[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea "probably possesses the expertise to
[cause]{.mark} temporary, limited [disruptions of]{.mark} some [critical
infrastructure]{.mark} networks and disrupt business networks in the
United States]{.underline}." The last thing anyone needs during the
pandemic is an already brittle critical infrastructure to be at the
mercy of Kim Jong Un.

Prevent nuclear catastrophe: Finally end the Korean War
https://thebulletin.org/2017/06/prevent-nuclear-catastrophe-finally-end-the-korean-war/

[The]{.underline} long-simmering [[confrontation between the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and North Korea has reached]{.mark} a
moment of [unprecedented tension]{.mark}. [The risk
that]{.mark}]{.underline} unintended [[war will break out]{.mark} due to
misjudgment [is high]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Indeed, as others
have observed, [East Asia is]{.underline} witnessing [a]{.underline}
"Cuban Missile [Crisis]{.underline} in slow motion."

According to Graham Allison, director of Harvard University's Belfer
Center for Science and International Affairs, it is now time "to examine
previously unthinkable options" on the Korean Peninsula---such as
scaling back joint US-South Korean military exercises in exchange for a
freeze on North Korean tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Considering these "unthinkable" options, Allison writes, would follow in
a tradition established during the Cuban Missile Crisis by John Kennedy
and Nikita Khrushchev, who both "blinked," and whose behavior ultimately
amounted to cooperative crisis management. One of the most unthinkable
options for the Korean Peninsula---but perhaps the most promising---is
for the United States and China to finally pursue a formal end to the
Korean War.

Two main stakeholders. The situation on the Korean Peninsula today is
fraught, to say the least. North [Korea]{.underline} remains in
diplomatic isolation. It has [continued testing nuclear weapons and
ballistic missiles, resulting in further escalation of tensions. The
United States and South Korea have exhibited]{.underline} increasing
[hawkishness]{.underline}, stepping up joint military exercises that
center on striking key facilities in North Korea as well as the
country's leadership ("decapitation"). Washington and Seoul's combined
forces have enhanced their preemptive strike capability---but [if
US-South Korean forces attacked the North in the name of
counterproliferation or regime change, the result would inevitably be
all-out war and region-wide catastrophe.]{.underline}

Arguably, the US-North Korea confrontation has reached the level of
mutually assured destruction. The two sides' military capabilities are
not rigorously balanced, as Washington and Moscow's nuclear
second-strike capabilities were balanced during the Cold War. [But a
[military confrontation would cause]{.mark}]{.underline} intolerable
[damage]{.underline} to both sides [and [catastrophe for the whole
region]{.mark}. Seoul would become an inferno]{.underline}. In
[Japan]{.underline}, nuclear power plants and US military bases [would
be targeted]{.underline} with missiles. [North Korea's special forces
might resort to]{.underline} guerrilla or [terrorist tactics involving
weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}. Perhaps even Yanbian, [a
Chinese region]{.underline} near the North Korean border with a large
population of ethnic Koreans, [would be destabilized]{.underline}. The
use of force is therefore not an option. [[The only]{.mark} viable
[solution]{.mark}]{.underline} to the North Korean nuclear crisis [[is
cooperative crisis management]{.underline}]{.mark}. Previously
unthinkable options simply must be explored.

But [[the stakeholders who can end the]{.mark} nuclear [crisis
are]{.mark}]{.underline} not the United States and North Korea. Instead,
as Allison has correctly suggested, they are [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and China]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is not merely
because the United States, as the region's predominant military power,
is exerting military pressure on North Korea, or that Beijing provides
Pyongyang an economic lifeline (making China the gatekeeper for
international economic sanctions against the North). Rather, [Washington
and Beijing hold the key to ending the crisis because they are the key
signatories of the Korean War Armistice Agreement]{.underline}---which
brought Korean War hostilities to an end but left the war itself in a
state of suspended animation.

To this day, despite rhetorical frictions between Beijing and Pyongyang,
China and North Korea share a "blood alliance" forged during the Korean
War. The latest research on the war---based on declassified North Korean
military documents that US and UN forces seized during the war, as well
as on archival materials from Russia and China---reveals that Mao Zedong
played a more active role in initiating the war than previously
understood. China is usually portrayed as entering the war in October
1950, after UN forces, pursuing a counterattack against North Korea,
reached the neighborhood of the Yalu River, which forms the border
between China and North Korea. But well before then---indeed, well
before the outbreak of war in June 1950---Mao had made a strategic
decision to support Kim Il-sung's invasion of the South. Kim badly
needed a larger army if he was to invade the South, and in the summer of
1949 Mao granted him approximately 30,000 ethnic Korean troops from the
People's Liberation Army (PLA), fully equipped with modern arms left by
the Soviet Red Army upon its departure from the country in 1948, and
with additional supplies from the PLA. In the early stages of China's
civil war, the 166th Division---an elite PLA force comprised of ethnic
Koreans---had formed the backbone of Communist forces fighting Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalist forces in Manchuria. Now these troops were
transferred to Kim's command, reappearing as the 6th Division of the
Korean People's Army (KPA). The 6th Division played a decisive role in
the Korean War---launching an initial surprise attack against Kaesong on
June 25, 1950, paving the way for the KPA's 3rd Division to mount a
lightning attack against Seoul on June 28, with the fighting then
continuing south to Taejon. (Much of this only became clear with the
1993 publication of a study by Ryo Hagiwara known in English as The
Korean War: A Conspiracy of Kim Il-sung and MacArthur.)

More than just a blood alliance, however, explains China's behavior on
the Korean Peninsula today. Just as Nikita Khrushchev deployed
nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba to strengthen the Soviet Union's
strategic position vis-à-vis the United States, China depends on
heavily-armed North Korea to help neutralize US forces in East Asia. The
only real difference is that Beijing is savvy enough to disguise its
actions---to let the confrontation on the Peninsula be perceived as
involving merely the United States and North Korea.

In fact, as Graham Allison has pointed out with considerable insight,
[[the]{.mark} real animating [force behind the]{.mark} North Korean
nuclear [crisis]{.mark}, and indeed behind tensions on the Korean
Peninsula]{.underline} since the end of the Korean War, [[is strategic
confrontation between the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
China]{.mark}. [It is therefore the]{.mark} [responsibility of Beijing
and Washington to reduce]{.mark} the [tensions]{.mark} that could cause
a catastrophic war]{.underline}. The two sides would do well to heed the
lesson that Kennedy drew from the Cuban Missile Crisis---that "while
defending our own vital interests, [nuclear powers must
avert]{.underline} those confrontations which bring an adversary to a
choice of either a humiliating retreat or a [nuclear war]{.underline}."

Now is the time. Among previously unthinkable measures to end the North
Korean nuclear crisis, the most effective would be simply to formally
end the abnormally protracted Korean War. After all, [the root cause of
the North Korean nuclear crisis is]{.underline} an ongoing Korean [Cold
War]{.underline}---contested [between the United States and
China]{.underline} (and at one time, discreetly, by the Soviet Union)
but disguised as an ideological battle over Korean unification, with
North and South contending for regime legitimacy. But [the Korean Cold
War has now reached the threshold of nuclear catastrophe]{.underline},
and it must end. Ending [the war would reduce North Korea's
motivation]{.underline} to assert the legitimacy of its regime, or guard
against "US nuclear blackmail," by equipping itself with nuclear-armed
missiles. And [China]{.underline}, freed from concerns that war would
break out on the peninsula or that the North Korean regime would
collapse, [would be able to implement more effective]{.underline}
economic [sanctions against North Korea and thereby contain nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}.

If Washington and Beijing committed themselves to the project,
negotiations toward a formal peace treaty would not have to be
exceedingly complicated. The parties could agree to minimal
preconditions: North Korea would stop its missile and nuclear tests
while the United States and South Korea would agree to constrain their
joint military exercises (an idea already proposed by Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi). Kim Jong-un, meanwhile, could be sidelined during the
talks, just as Fidel Castro was left completely out of communications
between Washington and Moscow at the critical moments of the Cuban
Missile Crisis. After the crisis, Castro and his regime survived for
more than half a century, contending with economic sanctions and causing
the rest of the world only modest problems.

When the Korean War is finally concluded, a new regional
confidence-building framework, based on the erstwhile six-party talks,
could be established---in much the same way that Washington and Moscow
established a crisis hotline following the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Formally [ending the Korean War]{.underline} should be the beginning,
not the end, of a years-long process of denuclearizing North Korea. It
[could even lead to the establishment of an East Asian
nuclear-weapon-free zone]{.underline}. In any event, [now is the time
for]{.underline} Presidents Donald [Trump and Xi]{.underline} Jinping
[to cooperate]{.underline}, as Kennedy and Khrushchev cooperated before
them, [to prevent nuclear catastrophe and negotiate a peace agreement
for the Korean Peninsula]{.underline}.

### 2AC Cyberterror

#### Emerging tech makes terrorist cyberattacks a viable option

Security Challenges, a professional journalist, taught Boston

[[Terrorists are]{.mark} also making an [**increasing use** of]{.mark}
modern technologies.]{.underline} [While there have been no cases of
'[cyber]{.mark}-terrorism']{.underline} --ie, no proved terrorist act
carried out through cyber means only-- [[terrorist]{.mark} groups have
indeed [used cyberspace for]{.mark} recruitment and funding as well as
[op]{.mark}erational purpose[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is an area
where intelligence agencies are very busy and alert, although these
activities are unlikely to reach the level of sophistication and
disruption that only State-sponsored groups can achieve in this domain.
[There is, however, a [**growing concern** about]{.mark} the possible
use of unmanned vehicles for [kinetic terrorist
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} --and not only on the battlefield (where
they have already occurred) but also in civilian and especially urban
environments--. What happened around Christmas 2018 at Gatwick airport
in London was quite telling, especially in light of the commercial
affordability and availability of such tools and their potential impact
on civilian life. [[NATO]{.mark} has just [launched a]{.mark}
[**specific initiative** to counter]{.mark} --on the battlefield but
potentially also elsewhere-- such a misuse of new technologies by
[terrorists]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Nuclear terror causes extinction

*Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists*, 2018,
https://doi.org/10.1080/00963402.2018.1436812)

But [the [consequences]{.mark} would go far beyond the effects in the
target country]{.underline}, however, [and]{.underline} promptly
**[[propagate worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Global and national
security, economy and finance, international governance and its
framework, national political systems, and the behavior of governments
and individuals would all be put under **severe trial**]{.underline}.
The severity of the effects at a national level, however, would depend
on the countries' level of development, geopolitical location, and
resilience. [Global [security]{.mark} and regional/national defense
schemes [would be]{.mark} strongly [affected]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[An
**increase in**]{.mark} **global [distrust]{.mark}** [would **spark
rising tensions**]{.mark} among countries and blocs]{.underline}, [that
could even [lead to the]{.mark} **brink of [nuclear weapons]{.mark}
use** by states]{.underline} (if, for instance, a sponsor country is
identified). [The consequences of]{.underline} such [a shocking scenario
would include a **decrease in states' self-control**]{.underline}, [an
**[escalation]{.mark} of [present conflicts]{.mark}** and the
**emergence of new ones**, accompanied by an **[increase in
military]{.mark} unilateralism** and military expenditures]{.underline}.
Regarding the economic and financial impacts[, a **severe [global
economic]{.mark} [depression]{.mark}** would rise from the
attack]{.underline}, likely **[lasting for years]{.underline}**. Its
duration would be strongly dependent on the course of the crisis. The
main results of such a crisis would include a 2 percent fall of growth
in global Gross Domestic Product, and a 4 percent decline of
international trade in the two years following the attack (cf. Figure
3). In the case of developing and less-developed countries, the economic
impacts would also include a shortage of high-technology products such
as medicines, as well as a fall in foreign direct investment and a
severe decline of international humanitarian aid toward low-income
countries. We expect an increase of unemployment and poverty in all
countries. Global poverty would raise about 4 percent after the attack,
which implies that at least 30 million more people would be living in
extreme poverty, in addition to the current estimated 767 million. [In
the area of international relations]{.underline}, [we would expect a
**[breakdown of key doctrines]{.mark}** involving politics]{.underline},
[security, and relations among states]{.underline}. These
[**international tensions could lead to a [collapse of the nuclear
order]{.mark}** as we know it today]{.underline}, [with a consequent
**setback of nuclear disarmament** and **nonproliferation
commitments**]{.underline}. In other words, [the whole system based on
the Nuclear **N**on- **P**roliferation **T**reaty would be put under
**severe trial**]{.underline}. [After the attack]{.underline}, [there
would be a reassessment of existing security doctrines]{.underline}, and
a deep review of concepts such as nuclear deterrence, no-firstuse,
proportionality, and negative security assurances. Finally, the behavior
of governments and individuals would also change radically. **[Internal
chaos]{.underline}** [fueled by the media and social networks would
**[threaten governance]{.mark} at all levels**]{.underline}, [with
greater impact on those countries with weak institutional
frameworks]{.underline}. [**[Social turbulence]{.mark}** would emerge in
most countries]{.underline}, [with consequent **attempts by governments
to impose restrictions on personal freedoms to preserve
order**]{.underline} -- possibly [by declaring a state of siege or
**state of emergency**]{.underline} -- and [legislation would surely
become tougher on human rights]{.underline}. [There would]{.underline}
also [be]{.underline} a **[significant increase in social
fragmentation]{.underline}** -- with a [deepening of antagonistic
views]{.underline}, [mistrust]{.underline}, [and
intolerance]{.underline}, both within countries and towards others --
and a [resurgence of large-scale social movements fostered by
ideological interests and **easily mobilized** through social
media]{.underline}.

### 1ac Russian Cyberattacks Extension

#### Escalation is likely

Mathew J. **Schwartz**, executive editor, DataBreachToday and for
European news coverage, **5-13**-2022, \"Russia-Ukraine War: Cyberattack
Escalation Risk Continues,\" No Publication,
https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/blogs/russia-ukraine-war-cyberattack-escalation-risk-continues-p-3231

While Ukraine remains at risk, of course, so too do any countries whose
governments have been siding against Russia. Thankfully, however, so far
the impact of online attacks has been much less than many analysts had
feared, as Russia appears to remain much more focused on physical
attacks. \"Perhaps the concept of a \'cyber war\' was over-hyped,\"
Jeremy Fleming, director of the U.K.\'s security, intelligence and cyber
agency, GCHQ, said earlier this week with classic British
understatement. \"But [[there\'s **plenty of cyber**]{.mark}
about]{.underline}, including a range of activity we and partners have
attributed to Russia,\" Fleming said Tuesday at the CyberUK conference
in Wales. \"[[We\'ve seen]{.mark} what looks like some
**[spillover]{.mark}** of activity [affecting other
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [we\'ve seen [indications that
Russia\'s cyber op]{.mark}erative[s]{.mark} continue to [look for
targets]{.mark} in countries that oppose their actions]{.underline}.\"
\"What we were expecting was, of course, a massive cyber campaign with
more spillovers,\" Juhan Lepassaar, executive director of the EU Agency
of Cybersecurity, known as ENISA, said at the conference. Satellite
Communications Disrupted Of course, [[there has been]{.mark} some
**[notable]{.mark} [Russian hacking]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including
[[the attack on **Viasat\'s**]{.mark} **KA-SAT [satellite]{.mark}**
communications terminals]{.underline} on Feb. 24 - the day Russia
invaded Ukraine. This week, [the EU, U.K., Ukraine and U.S. attributed
that attack to Russia]{.underline}. \"So yes, we\'ve seen that, but we
haven\'t seen a sustained effort,\" Lepassaar said (see: Russia-Ukraine
War: 7 Cybersecurity Lessons Learned). Multiple strains of wiper malware
have also been launched by Russia against Ukraine, experts say,
including against energy facilities. But part of the challenge facing
Moscow is that Ukraine has been devoting significant energy to shoring
up its online defenses, backed by support from allies, as well as NATO.
\"The Ukrainians have been stress testing involuntarily since 2014,\"
Lepassaar said of their online defenses. Likewise, Rob Joyce, the head
of cybersecurity at the U.S. National Security Agency, has lauded the
state of Ukraine\'s online defenses and told CyberUK attendees that
Ukraine offers a model for others to emulate. \"One of the things
they\'ve done is, they have emergency plans, having been under pressure
for years,\" he said at the conference. \"They have been able to
practice and they understand what good incident response is.\" Even
though so-called cyber war has failed to transpire, experts say [[the
risk of]{.mark} inadvertent or intentional [spillover remains high,
especially for]{.mark} **critical [infrastructure]{.mark}**
sectors]{.underline} (see: 9 Essentials for Global CISOs During
Russia\'s Ukraine War). \"I\'m still very worried about the threats
emanating from around the Russia-Ukraine situation,\" Joyce told the
BBC. This threat is being tracked at the highest levels of government.
Joyce said the White House is continuing to closely monitoring the
situation, not least given the ongoing risk that there would be
\"spillover of nation-state activity ... continuing on to impact civil
society.\" CISO Mandate: Stay Alert Hence while there\'s so far been no
all-out cyber blitzkrieg, CISOs should - and must - continue to
carefully track the conflict, given the risk that organizations might be
affected by cyberattack spillover, if not directly targeted. Threat
intelligence firm Flashpoint, for example, says it\'s been hearing this
question regularly from the CISOs and other clients it continues to
brief on the war: \"How might decisions made by Western governments and
commercial entities, such as economic sanctions, lead to an escalation
in cyberspace and the physical world?\" Another top concern, it says,
remains which industries are most at risk and the types of attacks they
should most beware. \"When it comes to the cyber domain and the
potential attacks on cyber infrastructure, it\'s something that we have
to be very concerned about,\" said Max Bergmann, the Europe program
director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a
Tuesday press briefing held by the Washington-based, bipartisan,
nonprofit policy research organization on Tuesday. Likely Targets
Flashpoint says [the most likely [targets]{.mark} for Russia remain
Ukrainian **[government and financial services]{.mark}** sites
[and]{.mark} \"**[military communication networks]{.mark}**\" but that
any [escalation would]{.mark} likely [focus on]{.mark} other countries\'
**[financial services sectors]{.mark}** and likely include distributed
denial-of-service attacks]{.underline}, phishing campaigns and worse.
\"Russian state-backed activity has so far focused on Ukrainian banks -
Privatbank and Oschadbank were targeted before the February invasion -
likely with the purpose of diminishing trust in the Ukrainian financial
sector both in the Ukrainian population and among Western partners,\"
Flashpoint says. \"The likeliest form of attacks include those that were
used against the Ukrainian banks - DDoS attacks, self-propagating wiper
attacks, or attacks leveraging banks\' compromised email
infrastructure - as well as attacks focusing on cyberespionage with the
purpose of aiding sanctions evasion.\" But Russia faces \"some real
challenges\" if it tries to escalate, said Bergmann at CSIS. \"It\'s a
very different environment than last year when ... Russia-linked cyber
actors attacked the Colonial Pipeline and took that down when the Biden
administration was in the midst of trying to sort of establish a detente
with Russia,\" he said. \"That is not the environment now, and as Russia
has bogged down in Ukraine, I don\'t think they\'re going to want sort
of an escalatory cycle when it comes to sort of provoking us to get more
involved in the conflict or to take direct action in the cyber domain
against them.\"

### 1ac NATO Cohesion Extension

#### NATO is key to avert all existential threats

of Diplomacy and International Relations, Harvard Kennedy School;
Director, American Secretaries of State Project, "Assessing the Value of
the NATO Alliance." Harvard's Belfer Center. 9-5-2018.
https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/assessing-value-nato-alliance

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Menendez, you have asked for an assessment of
NATO's value to the United States. In my judgment, [[NATO]{.mark}
continues [to be of **vital importance**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[to]{.mark} American [security]{.mark}]{.underline} interests in five
principal ways. First, [NATO is at the **core**]{.underline} [of one of
the **most significant foreign policy accomplishments**]{.underline} [in
American history]{.underline}---[the creation of a **long-term peace in
Europe**]{.underline} following the close of the Second World War.
**[Because of NATO]{.underline}** and the emergence of the European
Union, [Europe is **united**]{.underline} [after **centuries of division
and war**]{.underline}. [[NATO's military]{.mark} strength has been [a
**major reason**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for the **absence of
war**]{.underline} [with]{.underline}]{.mark} the Soviet Union and
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** since 1949. A recent Atlantic Council
study reminds that America spent 14.1 percent of its GDP on defense
during the First World War, 37.5 percent during the Second World War and
13.2 percent during the Korean Conflict. We spend nothing close to those
levels now in large part due to the great power peace we have enjoyed
for over seventy years. NATO has been a major factor in that peace. And
due to the expansion of NATO and the European Union eastward after the
fall of the Soviet Union, millions of East Europeans now live in free,
democratic societies---a significant success for U.S. diplomacy. Second,
[NATO delivers]{.underline} additional [benefits to]{.underline} U.S.
[military objectives and operations]{.underline} beyond our shores.
[[NATO is]{.mark} at the **heart of our [defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[of **North America**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[Europe]{.underline}** [[from **nuclear and conventional
threats**]{.underline}]{.mark}. British and French nuclear weapons join
ours in deterring aggression in the North Atlantic area. Since the late
1940s, every Administration has believed that [the **best
way**]{.underline} [to defend our country is through American forces
forward deployed in Europe with the NATO allies]{.underline}. [This
strategy **remains right** for today given Russia's invasion of
Georgia]{.underline} in 2008, [of Crimea and Eastern
Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014 [and its current pressure on Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania and Poland]{.underline}. [[NATO remains]{.mark} our
**[primary vehicle for deterring Putin]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Eastern
Europe. The [[NATO]{.mark} allies [host]{.mark} a great number of
[**critical bases** for U.S. forces]{.mark}]{.underline}---Ramstein in
Germany, Aviano in Italy, Rota in Spain, Souda Bay in Greece and
Incirlik in Turkey---[that **serve as a platform**]{.underline} [for our
presence in Europe, as well as for **U.S. force projection against
terrorist groups**]{.underline} [in **North Africa** and the **Mid**dle
**East** and for]{.underline} our [continued military operations in
Afghanistan]{.underline}. [Europe is a **critical link**]{.underline}
[in the development of our **Ballistic Missile Defense
network**]{.underline} focused on the Middle East with Turkey, Romania,
Poland, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, the UK and other
allies all hosting elements of this system. [**NATO
allies**]{.underline} continue to [participate in the U.S.-led coalition
against the **Islamic State**]{.underline} in the Middle East. [Many of
the allies play **lead roles**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} other
**[counter terror operations]{.underline}** [such as French forces in
Mali]{.underline} supported by the U.S. In Afghanistan, the [NATO allies
remain with us in combat operations and in training the Afghan
military]{.underline}. Over 1000 soldiers from European and other
partner nations have died there during the last seventeen years. [NATO
continues to **maintain the hard-earned peace in Kosovo**]{.underline}
[with European troops bearing the large share of the
burden]{.underline}. An EU-led force has taken on all of the
peacekeeping responsibility in Bosnia, freeing up the U.S. for other
activities. Third, [the **[NATO allies]{.mark}** are among our closest
and most supportive global partners as we [confront]{.mark} the **great
transnational challenges**]{.underline} that define this century---[the
**fight against [terrorism]{.mark}**, the entire complex of **[cyber
threats]{.mark}**, **[climate change]{.mark}**, the **risk of
[pandemics]{.mark}**, **mass [migration]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and
**others**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [**NATO** allies]{.underline} and
our partners in the European Union [act together]{.underline} with us on
these and other issues. [This is of **[incalculable
benefit]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to the U.S]{.underline}.]{.mark}
[Neither [Russia nor China have]{.mark} treaty
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[NATO is a **significant
advantage**]{.underline}]{.mark} [for the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [[when it **acts as a force multiplier for
American interests**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
