### Holography Solves

#### Only quantum holography accounts for whole/part duality that underscores all human-state relationships.

[[These conceptual problems]{.mark} in the relational turn [not only
limit]{.mark} the analytical utility of this otherwise promising
theoretical turn [but also]{.mark} potentially [weaken its ontological
robustness]{.mark}. In this context, I argue that [it is now necessary
to put the relational turn in dialogue with the quantum turn]{.mark} in
general [and its holographic perspective]{.mark} in particular. [Quantum
holography argues that actors are not just]{.mark} nodes or [relata tied
together by exogenous relations]{.mark} and networks. [Rather, they
are]{.mark} [relations as well as relata and actors]{.mark}. By
[envisioning parts (or actors) as always already comprising the
whole]{.mark} (and the whole's various parts and their relations),
[quantum holography treats relations as the very condition for the being
of "things" or "actors,"]{.mark} thus [ontologically dissolving the
stubborn]{.mark} [things]{.mark}/relations [binary]{.mark} that has
dogged some existing relational analysis. Different from the classical
conceptualization of relations as mechanistic mixture, assemblage, or
hybridity between parts, [quantum holography underscores the relational
enfolding of wholes into their constituent parts/actors]{.mark}. Such
[whole-part duality reminds us of the quantum effect of]{.mark}
[interference]{.mark} pattern or superposition, with the wave-particle
duality of light in quantum mechanics being its best example (Barad,
2007: 85, 265, 269).3]{.underline}

#### Newtonian ontology cannot account for humanity's intrinsic ability to have internal entanglements that then affect external relations. This destroys the affs ability to promote cooperation because their ontology sees humanity as separate, forever fracturing true global cooperation.

[As illustrated in Figure 1, the [Newtonian ontology sees individual
entities as the basic units]{.mark} [and their relations]{.mark} merely
[as]{.mark} an [external function]{.mark}/effect [of]{.mark} their
subsequent [interac- tion]{.mark}. In comparison, the existing
relational literature affords a more prominent role for relations and
networks. Nevertheless, relations often continue to be conceptualized as
something external to or between solid actors and entities.4 [Quantum
holography]{.mark}, by con- trast, [sees]{.mark} [relations as part and
parcel of what entities are]{.mark} and may become. That is, Pan 19
[relations are already implicated in entities]{.mark} (hence implicate
or internal relations) [even as entities are also externally
linked]{.mark} [by]{.mark} (explicate) [relations]{.mark}. As shown in
the illustration about [holographic relationality, inside an entity
exist traces of its large whole]{.mark} and its over- all relations,
[just as inside a seed]{.mark} [exist memories]{.mark} and traces
[of]{.mark} "interactions within [the]{.mark} [web]{.mark} [of
life]{.mark}" (Shiva, 2014: 438). Thus understood, an [entity is always
already relational]{.mark} [and its relations are inherent and
holographic.]{.mark} It ca[nnot be disentangled or disembedded from the
whole]{.mark} or other "entities" in the whole, [even if it may appear
to stand "alone]{.mark}."]{.underline}
