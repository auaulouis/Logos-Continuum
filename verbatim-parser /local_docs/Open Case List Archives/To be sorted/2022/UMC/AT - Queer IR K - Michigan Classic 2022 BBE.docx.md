### Queer State Reform Good

#### Absent structural change their project fails because it becomes locked into language-based opposition that fails to resolve social harms- means perm is only way to combat the violence they isolate

Strategy in this context consists of the ways in which we organize
energy to meet the ends we seek to achieve. [Strategy]{.underline} as
such **[is the mechanism by which]{.underline}** true **[politics is
generated]{.underline}**, both **[on the personal and the political
level]{.underline}**. A true **[[resistance politics has to incorporate
both]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[micro and]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[macro]{.underline}]{.mark}** levels of **[[analysis to]{.mark}
mediate differences and]{.underline}** to **[[confront]{.mark}
effectively the [forces of well-organized
opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Lesbian, gay, and **[[queer
movements]{.mark} have]{.underline}**, so far, **[[depend]{.mark}ed
[on]{.mark}]{.underline}** the involvement of
**[[individuals]{.underline}]{.mark}** as the primary drivers of social
change (and particularly the experience of labor movements) that
**[[individuals need]{.mark} to have [structural
representation]{.mark}]{.underline}** in order **[[to maintain]{.mark}
the [energy]{.mark} needed for sustained opposition.
[Individuals]{.mark} working against their oppressors]{.underline}**,
whether in the workplace or neighborhood, **[[cannot succeed without a
mechanism that can play a larger role in incorporating them into
communities of resistance where]{.underline}]{.mark}** mutual
**[[recognition is present]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **["We're Queer and
We're Here" is a necessary declaration of identity. But]{.underline}**
it is only a moment. **[Required is a strategy that can institutionalize
a movement towards resistance]{.underline}** so that change may be
recognized as a social necessity. **[Differences will continue to
exist]{.underline}**. Black women face the sexism inherent in their
relations with men while confronting racism; lesbians are confrtoned
with the hierarchy of sexual politics while dealing with arguments
around pornography and sexual pleasure. And more economic issues such as
the pervasive and growing feminization of poverty. Bisexual,
transsexual, and transgendered peoples are often ignored by all. Queers,
in general, encounter the real differences based on status and class as
they experience the oppression of the dominant culture. But these are
all in fact part of a larger class struggle which is borne out in the
conflict of the uses and control of energy and, ultimately, human
regeneration. They need to be recognized as such. **[The test of
successful movement will be whether we might honor all]{.underline}**
these **[divergent interests and experiences while joining together to
forge]{.underline}** a successful attempt to redistribute the rewards of
labor and to end the violence of prejudice.
**[[Resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then, **[[involves more than
language-based opposition to noxious forces]{.mark}. Real
[opposition]{.mark} [takes place in the realm of reproduction of
community and]{.mark}]{.underline}** the larger social sphere, on the
basis of daily existence and **[in the realm of [social]{.mark} and
productive [power]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### Queer Theory Fails

But to riff off of the now popular phrase ''gender trouble,'' [there
is]{.underline} some [race trouble]{.underline} here [with queer
theory]{.underline}. More particularly, [in its ''race for
theory'']{.underline} (Christian), **[[queer theory has]{.mark} often
[failed to address]{.mark} the [material realities of gays and lesbians
of color]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As black British activist Helen
(Charles) asks, [''[What happens to]{.mark} the deﬁnition of ['queer'
when]{.mark}]{.underline} you're washing up or having a wank? When
[[you're aware of misplacement]{.mark} or displacement [in your colour,
gender, identity]{.mark}? Do [they get subsumed]{.mark}]{.underline} \[.
. .\] [[into a homogeneous category]{.mark}, where]{.underline} class
and [other things that make up a cultural identity are
ignored]{.underline}?'' (101--102). [What]{.underline}, for example,
[are the ethical and material implications of queer theory if its
project is to dismantle all notions of]{.underline} identity and
[agency? The deconstructive turn in queer theory highlights the ways in
which]{.underline} [ideology functions to oppress and to proscribe ways
of knowing, but]{.underline} **[[what is the utility of queer theory on
the front lines, in]{.mark} the [trenches, on the street, or anyplace
where the racialized and sexualized body is beaten, starved, ﬁred,
cursed]{.mark}]{.underline}**---indeed, **[where the body is the site of
trauma]{.underline}**?6 [Beyond [queer theory]{.mark}'s failure to focus
on materiality, it [also has failed to acknowledge]{.mark} consistently
and critically [the intellectual, aesthetic, and political contributions
of nonwhite and non-middle-class gays, bisexuals, lesbians, and
transgendered]{.mark} people [in the struggle against homophobia and
oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [even when [white queer
theorists]{.mark} acknowledge these contributions**, [rarely]{.mark} do
they self-consciously and overtly [reﬂect on the ways]{.mark} in which
[their whiteness informs their critical queer
position]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and this is occurring at a time when
naming one's positionality has become almost standard protocol in other
areas of scholarship. Although there are exceptions, **[most often
[white queer theorists fail to acknowledge and address racial
privilege]{.mark}]{.underline}**.7 [Because [transgendered people,
lesbians, gays, and bisexuals of color often]{.mark} ground their
theorizing in a politics of identity, they frequently [fall prey to
accusations of ''essentialism'']{.mark}]{.underline} or
''anti-intellectualism.'' Galvanizing around identity, however, is not
always an unintentional ''essentialist'' move. Many times, it is an
intentional strategic choice.8 Cathy Cohen, for example, suggests that
''[[queer theorizing which calls for the elimination of ﬁxed categories
seems to]{.underline} **[ignore]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**the**
[ways]{.mark} in which]{.underline} some [[traditional social identities
and communal ties can]{.underline}]{.mark}, in fact, **[[be important to
one's survival'']{.underline}]{.mark}** (''Punks'' 450). The ''communal
ties'' to which Cohen refers are those which exist in communities of
color across boundaries of sexuality. For example, my grandmother, who
is homophobic, nonetheless must be included in the struggle against
oppression in spite of her bigotry. While her homophobia must be
critiqued, her feminist and race struggles over the course of her life
have enabled me and others in my family to enact strategies of
resistance against a number of oppressions, including homophobia. [Some
queer activists groups]{.underline}, however, [have argued fervently for
the disavowal of any alliance with heterosexuals, a disavowal that those
of us who belong to communities of color cannot]{.underline} necessarily
[afford to make]{.underline}.9 Therefore, [while offering a progressive
and sometimes transgressive politics of sexuality]{.underline}, the
**[seams of queer theory become exposed when that theory is applied to
identities around which sexuality may pivot, such as race and
class]{.underline}**. As a counter to this myopia and in an attempt to
close the gap between theory and practice, self and Other, Audre Lorde
proclaims: Without community there is no liberation, only the most
vulnerable and temporary armistice between an individual and her
oppression. But [community must not mean a shedding of our differences,
nor the pathetic pretense that these differences do not
exist]{.underline}. \[. . .\]I urge each one of us here to reach down
into that deep place of knowledge inside herself and touch the terror
and loathing of any difference that lives there. See whose face it
wears. Then the personal as the political can begin to illuminate all
our choices. (112--13, emphasis in original) For Lorde, a [[theory that
dissolves]{.mark} the [communal identity---in all]{.mark} of its
[difference--- around which the marginalized can politically organize is
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[progressive]{.underline}]{.mark}**
one. **[[Nor is it one that gays, bisexuals, transgendered]{.mark}
people, [and lesbians of color can afford to adopt]{.mark}, for [to do
so would be to foreclose]{.mark} possibilities of
[change.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Additionally, Morland and Willox do not include formal education, which
is a founding block of our anti-queer taboos and inhibitions.
[Addressing LGBT/Queer issues in education]{.underline}, however, [is an
intrinsic part of social and moral change]{.underline}. For instance, in
rural Saskatchewan, a twelve-year old Two-Spirited youth is courageously
attempting to attend and be successful at school in her/his preferred
gender. The absence of culturally relevant material in the curriculum,
support from educators, and a gender flexible state-controlled
institution makes such efforts difficult. When discussing the shake-up
of social and moral taboos, [Queer Theory fails to acknowledge and
analyze that some of our most severe battlegrounds are taking place
within such institutions]{.underline} like this eighth grade rural
Canadian classroom. Morland and Willox analyses what [the closet door
might be for different queers]{.underline}: Perhaps you become queer by
being seen reading this book or Maybe you are hiding its cover behind
Cosmopolitan or Men's Health. Alternatively, if you are queer, are your
actions queer enough? Are you in the closet or are you out and proud?
(p. 1) [Queer Theory sets the tone that being in the closet (whatever
shape, size, colour or texture that closet door might be) is bad; being
out is good]{.underline}. Paradoxically, this text on queer theory then
perpetuates a binary position. In my work with Queer Peace
International, I have worked with queers who are refugees, displaced
persons, and/or live in a homophobic community. These individuals must
remain in the closet in order to grow, remain strong, and ultimately
survive. There, too, have been those who have "come out" but, when they
didn't fit into the foreign based [LGBT culture, returned to the closet
where they retained some form of normalcy and acceptance. There is a
certain a-critical "promosexual" cultural viewpoint underlyingQueer
Theory.[It insufficiently addresses those on the periphery or those
affected by North American or Western queer exports in different world
regions and communities]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The
[contributors call for acceptance and embracing plural
identities]{.mark} and]{.underline}, although this book does present
several realities, [[**it does not venture outside of the white,
middle/upper-class American psyche**.Queer Theory lacks a

### [AFF AT -- War Turn]{.underline}

#### Sexual desires lead to arms buildup and subsequent war

Lloyd **Demause 15** (April 1, 2015) Lloyd Demause, an American social
thinker known for his work in the field of psychohistory. He did
graduate work in political science at Columbia University and later
trained as a lay psychoanalyst, which is defined as a psychoanalyst who
does not have a medical degree. He is the founder of The Journal of
Psychohistory. (Accessed 7/22/2022) {"Nuclear War as an Anti-Sexual

[Psychoanalytic writing on **[nuclear war has]{.mark}, to date, mainly
concentrated on the variety of defenses people have against the
realization that [a nuclear holocaust will mean the real death of
hundreds of millions of people]{.mark} and the end of most of
civilization**, as we know it. Lifton\'s work on \"numbing,\" for
instance, has eloquently described the numerous denials, evasions,
idealizations, displacements and other defenses so often used by those
in power and by the average person when thinking about the nuclear
holocaust]{.underline} (Lifton and Falk, 1982). Mack (1981),
Brenman-Gibson (1986) and other psychoanalysts have made telling cases
for the proposition that most people have severe emotional resistances
against acknowledging the ghastly realities of nuclear war. In each of
these works, however, the assumption has been made that the reason
people so badly distort their perceptions of reality in the case of
nuclear weapons is that the reality of nuclear war is so horrifying.
[Yet I know of no other clinical **[psychoanalytic studies that trace
the source of psychic defenses to fear of reality. Defenses are usually
thought to be constructed against wishes]{.mark}, against the
unacceptable Id wishes, not against unpleasant reality.**]{.underline}
If a patient denies the destructiveness of his or her current actions,
it is because he or she feels guilty about the wish to destroy someone.
The Journal of Psychohistory 42 (4) Spring 2015 Nuclear War as an Anti-S
exual Group Fantasy 321 If this is equally true in thinking about
nuclear war, then one must suspect that the defenses have in fact been
constructed against a wish to have a nuclear holocaust. [Could this be
possible? **[Could it be that the world\'s greatest fear is also
unconsciously the world\'s greatest wish? Is it possible that we are
mesmerized by nuclear weapons because the promise of a nuclear war is
for some reason overwhelmingly attractive to us]{.mark}, and plays an
extremely important intrapsychic role** in our lives?]{.underline}
Carrying the parallel between the clinical and the social one step
further, the following question might be asked: [Is it possible that the
world\'s addiction to nuclear weapons might be fueled by both aggressive
and sexual drives, both destructive and erotic wishes, as in the case of
other addictions? Most analysts do not usually consider that the drive
toward a nuclear holocaust might have sexual origins.]{.underline} To
begin with, it seems too obvious, too "pop-psychological,\" to point out
that the language of those proposing nuclear war is filled with
continuous phallic references, such as \"standing tall,\" \"displays of
firmness,\" \"stiffening of the national will,\" \"making the Russians
impotent.\" \"knocking their balls off,\" and so on (Caldicott, 1984;
deMause, 1985b). When those who imagine or witness nuclear explosions
describe the \"beauty\" of the phallic mushroom cloud or the \"orgiastic
release\" of the explosion (Chernus, 1986), [it seems almost
embarrassing to draw attention to the **all-too-[obvious sexual language
being used. And when a magazine describes a nuclear bomber as \"a
breathtakingly beautiful airplane with slim-silhouette wings that meld
into a fuselage that breathes speed, the swanlike aircraft is designed
to penetrate]{.mark} Soviet air defenses**, unleashing nuclear-tipped
missiles at targets deep inside the country\"]{.underline} (Time, 1987),
it seems almost superfluous to point out that the bomber in question is
in fact an ugly world-destroyer, not a \"swanlike\" phallus depositing
its load \"deep inside" its target. [Sensitive reporters who interview
hundreds of nuclear war planners are not too **[embarrassed to observe
that these experts are mainly people sublimating sexual---indeed, often
homosexua]{.mark}l---preoccupations.**]{.underline} Thomas Allen
describes the world of those in the War College who play nuclear war
games: There is a football-stadium excitement about the game . . . the
players get together in a kind of locker-room camaraderie. (The
towel-snapping image is not overly drawn. Women players are as rare in
the male world of the war game as they are in football locker rooms. To
further the jock image, players call their post game analysis a \"hot
wash-up.\") (Allen, 1987) 322 Lloyd deMause Carol Cohn, in reporting on
her experiences in observing the nearly all-male world of nuclear war
experts, found their language dominated by sexual imagery.
\"[[**Feminists have often suggested that an important aspect of the
arms race is phallic worship**,]{.mark}\" she begins. **\"[I have always
found this an uncomfortably reductionist explanation and hoped that my
research at the Center would yield a more complex analysis.]{.mark}\"
Yet she found no way to sidestep the fact that while rational analysis
was in short supply, [the subject of male potency appeared to be the
central topic of every lecture]{.mark}:** I thought that at least at
some point in a long talk about \"penetration aids,\" someone would
suddenly look up, slightly embarrassed to be caught in such blatant
confirmation of feminist analyses of What\'s Going On Here.]{.underline}
Of course, I was wrong. There was no evidence that any feminist
critiques had ever reached the ears, much less the minds, of these men.
American military dependence on nuclear weapons was explained as
\"irresistible, because you get more bang for the buck.\" Another
lecturer solemnly and scientifically announced, \"to disarm is to get
rid of all your stuff.\" Other lectures were filled with discussion of
vertical erector launchers, thrust-to-weight ratios, soft lay downs,
deep penetration, and the comparative advantages of protracted versus
spasm attacks---or what one military adviser to the [**[National
Security Council has called \"releasing 70 to 80 percent of our
megatonnage in one orgasmic whump]{.mark}**.\" There was serious concern
about the need to harden our missiles and the need to \"face it, the
Russians are a little harder than we are.\"]{.underline} Disbelieving
glances would occasionally pass between me and my one ally in the summer
program, another woman, but no one else seemed to notice. (Cohn, 1987)
[If even untrained journalists notice that **nuclear [war discussions
are filled with \"homoerotic excitement\" (]{.mark}Cohn, 1987, p. 695[),
need the psychoanalyst be so inhibited in investigating the possible
sexual sources of war]{.mark}?** What surprised me most in preparing
this paper is that when I finished reading through most of the several
hundred books and articles written by psychoanalysts on the causes of
war since Freud\'s 1932 essay, **\"Why War?\" I found that [clinical
studies of the actual words and motivations of real people going to
actual wars were exceedingly rare]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Most
psychoanalytic theories of war are non-clinical and repeat in one form
or another Freud\'s conclusion that war is caused by \"the instinct for
hatred and aggression\" (Freud, 19321 p. 209). But this conclusion is
not based on empirical studies of the actual words used by people as
they bring about wars.

Queer organizing against Israel\'s deployment of gay rights discourses
to mask the occupation of Palestine---referred to as \"[[pinkwashing\"
within academic and activist circles---has raised pertinent questions
about the relations between settler colonialism, sexuality gender, race,
and (gay) imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such [campaigns have
directed attention to the realities of occupation in Palestine/Israel
while simultaneously obscuring the historical and present-day colonial
processes that enable transnational political intervention]{.underline}
on Turtle Island---or what is commonly known as Canada and the United
States.1 In this essay, we ask how critics of Israeli pink
washing---known as pinkwatchers---varyingly challenge, engage, negoti
ate, perform, or reproduce settler colonialism on Indigenous lands. We
examine debates over the participation of Queers Against Israeli Apart
heid (QuAIA) in Pride Toronto (Pride) in 2010 and the subsequent for
mation of the Pride Coalition for Free Speech (PCFS). [[By focusing on
these debates, we seek to critically explore how certain queer praxes
have worked to normalize and invisibilize settler colonialism]{.mark} in
the Canadian context and to reproduce Canada as a progressive
queer-friendly liberal state.]{.underline} While our discussion focuses
on QuAIA, PCFS, and Pride 2010, the objective of our essay is not to
single out groups and organizations but to contribute to conversations
about the broader political stakes of anti racism, anticolonialism, and
decolonization in radical queer organizing. [[These examples serve as
the entry point for us to consider in what ways the articulation of
\"radical queer perspectives\" might be complicit with the white settler
state proje]{.mark}ct, wherein the casting of Canada as a gay-friendly
nation invisibilizes past and ongoing processes of colonialism. Our
essay]{.underline} suggests that criticism of the use of queer rights
and liberal tolerance to justify governmental, industrial, and military
actions often works to limit discussions of settler colonialism to
places, nations, and peoples who are already invisible within that
frame. Describing how [que[er groups naturalize notions of belonging
and]{.mark} Canadian [identity, as well as how queer cri tiques
ofpinkwashing fail to address settler colonialism]{.mark} in Canada, we
seek to [underscore the way Indigenous struggles for sovereignty are
invisibil ized in activists\' attempts to address issues of free
speech]{.mark}]{.underline}, homonational ism, and occupation in
Palestine/Israel. [Where the pinkwashing of Israel has been criticized
by queer activists who effectively surveil and organize against, or
pinkwatch, such activities, [the complicity of their activist efforts
with settler colonialism ultimately whitewashes
colonization]{.mark}]{.underline} in Canada. We argue, therefore, that
the pinkwatching of Israel enables the pinkwash ing, or rather
whitewashing, of Canada.
