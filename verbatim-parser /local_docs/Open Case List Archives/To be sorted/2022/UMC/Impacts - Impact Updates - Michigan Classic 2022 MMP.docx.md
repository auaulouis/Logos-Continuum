The evolution [**of Putin's historical revisionism** can be seen
throughout his public statements over the years.]{.underline} In 2005[,
he famously described the collapse of the Soviet Union as **the greatest

pernicious, unipolar world---one led not by Moscow, but by
Washington---that it had create]{.underline}d. Last year, in perhaps the
clearest articulation of his worldview[, Putin said that Ukrainians and
Russians are "one people---**a single whole."**]{.underline} On Monday,
[he took that sentiment even further, declaring Ukraine to be "**an
inalienable part of our own** history, culture, and spiritual space"
whose independence was a product not of self-determination]{.underline}
(Ukrainians resoundingly voted in favor of independence from the Soviet
Union in a 1991 referendum), but rather "a mistake."Unlike his 2014
address announcing Moscow's annexation of Crimea, which was largely
framed as a moment of celebration[, **this was an angry speech**---one
ostensibly designed to make Russia's people angry too, and **to justify
what was to come**.]{.underline} "In territories adjacent to Russia,
which I have to note is our historical land, a hostile 'anti-Russia' is
taking shape," Putin said in another address ahead of the invasion. "For
our country, it is a matter of life and death, a matter of our
historical future as a nation." It's hard to know what Putin means by
historical future (which is, on its face, an oxymoron), though we can
take an educated guess. [When Putin speaks of Russia today, he speaks of
a country whose greatness is defined by its past---namely, its imperial
history and its victory during World War II---which he believes must
guide its present]{.underline}. "Putin weaponized history by giving it a
function," Orysia Lutsevych, the head of the Ukraine Forum at the

#### Putin's rhetoric and historical narratives

To paraphrase one of Barack Obama's [favorite
phrases](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/12/obama-right-side-of-history/420462/),
the arc of history is long, but it bends toward justice. Were
**[Vladimir Putin]{.underline}** to offer his own rendition of these
words, it would probably go something along the lines of: [The arc of
**history is long, but it bends backwards**]{.underline}. This, at
least, appeared to be the thrust of the Russian president's message this
week when he [**offered** a **[rambling and
ahistorical](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/67828#sel=8:9:vX6,8:24:UFE;19:1:b6m,19:26:Xov;34:1:H38,35:35:2rw;52:72:Wl6,53:55:l2j;60:20:Xr6,60:56:Xry;68:19:WNj,68:80:22Z;69:57:Lj2,70:24:ksw) speech
dismissing Ukraine's right to exist and then days later announced
Moscow's intent to invade** the country in order to "[demilitarize and
denazify
Ukraine](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67843)]{.underline}."
In his telling, if [**Ukraine** had **once been part of the Soviet
sphere**, it should be part of Russia. And just as Russia defeated the
Nazi regime in Germany, it would do so again---this time in
Kyiv.**Putin**]{.underline} is not the only world leader who **[has
harkened back to an ahistorical]{.underline}** past to justify his
decisions in the present. Right-wing nationalists [around the
world](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/02/11/history-patriotism-right-wing-politics/) have
sought to portray themselves as the primary defenders of a glorious past
that their enemies would seek to deny or forget. By [whitewashing
uncomfortable
legacies](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/08/30/the-kremlin-is-trying-to-whitewash-russias-stalinist-past-a67096) and
seeking to cultivate a politics of [historic
grievance](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-rues-soviet-collapse-demise-historical-russia-2021-12-12/),
Putin has attempted the same. But in his justification for the [invasion
of
Ukraine](https://www.theatlantic.com/category/russias-invasion-ukraine/),
Putin's ahistoricism has bordered on delusion. Whether the Russian
people or the rest of the world share in it, for now, appears to be
immaterial: If there's one audience this [**revisionist history** is
designed for]{.underline}, it's Putin [himself]{.underline}.[**The
evolution of Putin's historical revisionism can be seen throughout his
public statements over the years.** In 2005, he
famously [described](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna7632057) the
collapse of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of
the 20th century. Two years later,
Putin [bemoaned](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/24034) the
aftermath of the Soviet era and the pernicious, unipolar world---one led
not by Moscow, but by Washington---that it had created. Last year, in
perhaps the clearest articulation of his worldview, **Putin said that
Ukrainians and Russians are "[one people---a single
whole](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67843)**." On Monday,
he took that sentiment even further, declaring Ukraine to be "an
inalienable part of our own history, culture, and spiritual space" whose
independence was a product not of self-determination (Ukrainians
resoundingly voted in favor of independence from the Soviet Union in

but rather "a mistake."Unlike his **[2014

Moscow's annexation of Crimea, which was largely framed as a moment of
celebration,** this was an angry speech---one ostensibly designed to
make Russia's people angry too, and to justify what was to
come.]{.underline} "In territories adjacent to Russia, which I have to
note is our historical land, a hostile 'anti-Russia' is taking shape,"
Putin said in another address ahead of the invasion. "For our country,
it is a matter of life and death, a matter of our historical future as a
nation."It's hard to know what Putin means by **[historical
future]{.underline}** (which is, on its face, an oxymoron), though we
can take an educated guess. When Putin speaks of Russia today, he speaks
of a country whose greatness is defined by its past---namely, its
imperial history and its victory during World War II---which he believes
must guide its present. "Putin weaponized history by giving it a
function," Orysia Lutsevych, the head of the Ukraine Forum at the
London-based Chatham House think tank, told me. As far as the Russian
president is concerned, "history is the fortune teller of the future."
**[Such historical narratives can be]{.underline}** compelling,
especially when they elicit the kind of nostalgic nationalism that has
proved potent elsewhere, including in the United States (where Donald
Trump's Republican Party has dubbed itself the defender of ["patriotic
education"](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/us/politics/trump-patriotic-education.html)),
India (where Hindu nationalists have [appealed
to](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/08/modi-erdogan-religious-nationalism/615052/) pride
in India's past to undermine its secular present), and Hungary (where
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán
often [invokes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/03/how-viktor-orban-turned-century-hungarian-history-into-secret-weapon/) the
territories the country lost after the First World War). "Putin is not
the only person who is old enough to have felt that sense of deep,
personalized humiliation and shame that came with the loss of power of
the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War," Keir Giles, the author
of [**[​​Moscow Rules: What Drives Russia to Confront the
West]{.underline}**](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780815735748), told
me. "Anything that reasserts Russia as that great power with a greater
status than others and the right to a global presence and global
influence in others' affairs will be popular in those sectors of the
Russian population."Still, it's difficult to gauge just how big that
sector is or how pervasive the narrative has been among those who don't
share Putin's semi-mythological view of history. A recent [CNN
poll](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2022/02/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-poll-intl/),
published the day before the start of Moscow's military invasion of
Ukraine, found that though roughly half of Russians support using
military force to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, only 36 percent
support doing so as a means of forcing a reunification of the two
countries. The lack of support for the latter was most clearly evidenced
by [anti-war
protests](https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2022/02/photos-anti-war-protests-russia/622914/) that
have broken out across Russian cities.When I spoke with Denis Volkov,
the director of the Moscow-based Levada Center, Russia's last
independent pollster, in early February, he told me that though the
majority of Russians fear war, few would feel comfortable voicing
opposition to it if it came due to fear of reprisals. Indeed, more
than [1,700
arrests](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/we-dont-want-this-russians-react-to-the-ukraine-invasion?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Othe) have
already been made. Besides, Volkov said, "public opinion will be no
limit to the Russian government."Though Putin may feel obliged to
justify his war of choice to the Russian people, who with Ukrainians
will share the costs of a bloody and drawn-out conflict, **[his
revisionist history is designed to appeal to]{.underline}** no one more
so than himself. By restoring **[Russia's control over its former
territories, Putin]{.underline}** not only **[corrects what he sees as a
historic wrong but also cements his place in Russian history as the
leader who restored the country to its rightful
status]{.underline}**.The irony is that in his quest to make Russia
great again, he risks achieving just the opposite. Invading Ukraine has
already resulted in [wide-ranging
sanctions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/sanctions-against-russia-at-a-glance-people-organisations-uk-us-eu) and
has all but ensured Russia's diplomatic isolation. Even Putin's friends
in Europe, such
as [Orbán](https://twitter.com/zoltanspox/status/1497099482965721103?s=20&t=imIB8HpI9TF87fiiLNyf0g) and
Czech President [Milos
Zeman](https://www.reuters.com/business/czech-president-russia-should-be-cut-off-swift-2022-02-24/),
have gone out of their way to reiterate their support for Ukraine and
their commitment to a joint European Union stance."Putin's views have
become more and more extreme over time to the point where they are now
more or less unrecognizable and have few points of contact with history
as it's understood in the outside world," Giles said. "He's operating in
a different plane of reality and in a different century."

### Russia Not Revisionist

#### Russia's not revisionist -- 

#### peace talks prove

Taliban of Afghanistan. He is currently a visiting professor at King\'s

[There is still the possibility of a diplomatic settlement that would
bring an early end to this dreadful war and Russian military withdrawal
while safeguarding the vital interests of Ukraine. Indeed, if the
Russians are ever to withdraw, a diplomatic agreement on the terms of
withdrawal will be necessary.]{.underline} The first round of
Ukrainian-Russian talks has now taken place in Belarus, and a member of
the Ukrainian delegation has stated that "The parties identified a
number of priority topics in which certain solutions were outlined". The
West should back a peace agreement and Russian withdrawal by offering
Russia the lifting of all new sanctions imposed on it. The offer to
Ukraine should be a massive reconstruction package that will also help
Ukraine to move towards the West economically and politically rather
than militarily -- just as Finland and Austria were able to do during
the Cold War despite their neutral status. [**The demands by the Russian
side are that Ukraine should sign a treaty of neutrality; engage in
"demilitarisation" and "denazification"; and recognise Russian
sovereignty over Crimea,** which was seized back by Russia after the
Ukrainian Revolution.]{.underline} These demands are a mixed bag of the
acceptable, the unacceptable, and the undefined. The option of
neutrality for Ukraine has often been called "Finlandisation", and
perhaps the determined and unified Ukrainian response to Russian
aggression over the past week has given a new meaning to that term in
the case of Ukraine. For like the Finns in the "winter war" of 1939-40,
the Ukrainians have also been abandoned militarily by the West, which
has declared publicly and repeatedly that it has no intention of
fighting to defend them. On the other hand, it seems that the
extraordinary courage and resolution with which the Finns fought
convinced Stalin that to rule Finland would be too much of a challenge.
Finland became the only part of the former Russian Empire not to be
incorporated in the USSR, and during the cold war, though neutral by
treaty, was able to develop as a successful social market democracy.
Similarly, we must hope that the courage and determination of the
Ukrainians has convinced Putin that it will be impossible to run Ukraine
as a Russian client state, and **[neutrality is the best deal he is
going to get.]{.underline}** President Volodymyr Zelensky has publicly
hinted that a treaty of neutrality may be on offer; and he is right to
do so. For two things have been made absolutely clear by this war: that
Russia will fight to prevent Ukraine becoming a military ally of the
West, and the West will not fight to defend to defend Ukraine. In view
of this, to keep open the possibility of an offer of Nato membership
that Nato has no intention of ever honouring, and asking Ukrainians to
die for this fiction, is worse than hypocritical. As to
"demilitarisation" and "denazification", the meaning and terms of these
will have to be negotiated. Demilitarisation is obviously unacceptable
if it means that Ukraine must unilaterally dissolve its armed forces;
[but the latest statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has
suggested that Russia would accept a ban on missiles based in
Ukraine.]{.underline} This could be modelled on a similar guarantee to
the US that ended the Cuba Missile Crisis. As for "Denazification", this
presumably means that Ukraine should ban extreme right wing nationalist
parties and militias at Russia's behest. This is a completely
unacceptable interference in Ukraine's internal affairs; but perhaps
Ukraine could make a counter-offer that would meet Moscow's concerns
about the rights and future of the Russian minority in Ukraine by
guaranteeing these under the Ukrainian constitution -- which, by the
way, is something that the West should support anyway, in accordance
with its own principles. There remains the demand for recognition of the
Russian annexation of Crimea. Here, respect for international law
(slightly ambiguous in the case of Crimea, which was only transferred
from Russia to Ukraine by Soviet decree in 1954) must be tempered by
considerations of reality, the prevention of future conflict, and the
interests of ordinary people in the region -- which is essentially what
we have been asking Russia to do in the case of Kosovo. Ukraine has
already lost Crimea, and cannot recover it, as Serbia cannot recover
Kosovo, without a bloody and unending war that in this case Ukraine
would almost certainly lose. Our principle in all such disputes must be
that the fate of the territories concerned must be decided by local
democratic referenda under international supervision. This should also
apply to the Donbas separatist republics. These proposals will be
denounced as "rewarding Russian aggression"; [but if Putin's original
aim really was to subjugate the whole of Ukraine, then by such an
agreement Moscow would fall far short of its maximal goals. **Moreover,
such an agreement would give Russia nothing that it had not in practice
already achieved before launching the invasion.**]{.underline} The West
is morally right to oppose the monstrous and illegal Russian war and to
have imposed exceptionally severe sanctions on Russia in response, but
would be morally wrong to oppose a reasonable agreement to end the
invasion and spare the people of Ukraine terrible suffering. America's
own record over the past generation gives no basis for such
self-righteous hyper-legalism.

[No, none of us know what's going to happen. You don't think he has
designs on Kyiv? No, I **don't think he has designs on
Kyiv**]{.underline}. I think he's interested in taking at least the
Donbass, and maybe some more territory and eastern Ukraine, and, number
two, he wants to install in Kyiv a pro-Russian government, a government
that is attuned to Moscow's interests. I thought you said that he was
not interested in taking Kyiv. No, he's interested in taking Kyiv for
the purpose of regime change. O.K.? As opposed to what? As opposed to
permanently conquering Kyiv. It would be a Russian-friendly government
that he would presumably have some say over, right? Yes, exactly. But
it's important to understand that [it is fundamentally different from
conquering and holding onto Kyiv.]{.underline} Do you understand what
I'm saying? We could all think of imperial possessions whereby a sort of
figurehead was put on the throne, even if the homeland was actually
controlling what was going on there, right? We'd still say that those
places had been conquered, right? I have problems with your use of the
word "imperial." I don't know anybody who talks about this whole problem
in terms of imperialism. This is great-power politics, and what the
Russians want is a regime in Kyiv that is attuned to Russian interests.
It may be ultimately that the Russians would be willing to live with a
neutral Ukraine, and that it won't be necessary for Moscow to have any
meaningful control over the government in Kyiv. It may be that they just
want a regime that is neutral and not pro-American. When you said that
no one's talking about this as imperialism, in Putin's speeches he
specifically refers to the "territory of the former Russian Empire,"
which he laments losing. So it seems like he's talking about it. I think
that's wrong, because I think you're quoting the first half of the
sentence, as most people in the West do. He said, "Whoever does not miss
the Soviet Union has no heart." And then he said, "Whoever wants it back
has no brain." He's also saying that Ukraine is essentially a made-up
nation, while he seems to be invading it, no? O.K., but put those two
things together and tell me what that means. I'm just not too sure. He
does believe it's a made-up nation. I would note to him, all nations are
made up. Any student of nationalism can tell you that. We invent these
concepts of national identity. They're filled with all sorts of myths.
So he's correct about Ukraine, just like he's correct about the United
States or Germany. The much more important point is: [he understands
that **he cannot conquer Ukraine** and integrate it into a greater
Russia or into a reincarnation of the former Soviet Union. He can't do
that. What he's doing in Ukraine is fundamentally different. He is
obviously lopping off]{.underline} some territory. He's going to take
some territory away from Ukraine, in addition to what happened with
Crimea, in 2014. Furthermore, he is definitely interested in regime
change. Beyond that, it's hard to say exactly what this will all lead
to, except for the fact that [he **is not going to conquer all of
Ukraine**]{.underline}. It would be a blunder of colossal proportions to
try to do that. I assume that you think if he were to try to do that,
that would change your analysis of what we've witnessed. Absolutely. My
argument is that he's not going to re-create the Soviet Union or try to
build a greater Russia, that [**he's not interested in conquering** and
integrating Ukraine into Russia]{.underline}. It's very important to
understand that we invented this story that Putin is highly aggressive
and he's principally responsible for this crisis in Ukraine. The
argument that the foreign-policy establishment in the United States, and
in the West more generally, has invented revolves around the claim that
he is interested in creating a greater Russia or a reincarnation of the
former Soviet Union. There are people who believe that when he is
finished conquering Ukraine, he will turn to the Baltic states. [**He's
not going to turn to the Baltic states**.]{.underline} First of all, the
Baltic states are members of nato and--- Is that a good thing? No.
You're saying that he's not going to invade them in part because they're
part of nato, but they shouldn't be part of nato. Yes, but those are two
very different issues. I'm not sure why you're connecting them. Whether
I think they should be part of nato is independent of whether they are
part of nato. [They are part of nato. They have an Article 5
guarantee---that's all that matters. Furthermore, he's **never** shown
any evidence that he's **interested in conquering the Baltic
states**]{.underline}. Indeed, he's never shown any evidence that he's
interested in conquering Ukraine. It seems to me that if he wants to
bring back anything, it's the Russian Empire that predates the Soviet
Union. He seems very critical of the Soviet Union, correct? Well, I
don't know if he's critical. He said it in his big essay that he wrote
last year, and he said in a recent speech that he essentially blames
Soviet policies for allowing a degree of autonomy for Soviet Republics,
such as Ukraine. But he also said, as I read to you before, "Whoever
does not miss the Soviet Union has no heart." That's somewhat at odds
with what you just said. I mean, he's in effect saying that he misses
the Soviet Union, right? That's what he's saying. What we're talking
about here is his foreign policy. The question you have to ask yourself
is whether or not you think that this is a country that has the
capability to do that. You realize that this is a country that has a
G.N.P. that's smaller than Texas. Countries try to do things that they
don't have the capabilities for all the time. You could have said to me,
"Who thinks that America could get the Iraqi power system working
quickly? We have all these problems in America." And you would've been
correct. But we still thought we could do it, and we still tried to do
it, and we failed, right? America couldn't do what it wanted during
Vietnam, which I'm sure you would say is a reason not to fight these
various wars---and I would agree---but that doesn't mean that we were
correct or rational about our capabilities. I'm talking about the
raw-power potential of Russia---the amount of economic might it has.
Military might is built on economic might. You need an economic
foundation to build a really powerful military. [To go out and conquer
countries like Ukraine and the Baltic states and to re-create the former
Soviet Union or re-create the former Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe
would require a massive army, and that would require an economic
foundation that contemporary Russia does not come close to
having]{.underline}. There is no reason to fear that Russia is going to
be a regional hegemony in Europe. [Russia is not a serious threat to the
United States.]{.underline}

#### Only reacting to Western expansion

I think all the [trouble in this case really started in April, 2008, at
the nato Summit in Bucharest,]{.underline} where afterward [nato issued
a statement that said Ukraine and Georgia would become part of
nato.]{.underline} The Russians made it unequivocally clear at the time
that they viewed this as an existential threat, and they drew a line in
the sand. Nevertheless, what has happened with the passage of time is
that we have moved forward to include Ukraine in the West to make
Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia's border. Of course, this includes
more than just nato expansion. nato expansion is the heart of the
strategy, but it includes E.U. expansion as well, and it includes
turning Ukraine into a pro-American liberal democracy, and, [from a
Russian perspective, this is an existential threat.]{.underline} You
said that it's about "turning Ukraine into a pro-American liberal
democracy." I **[don't put much trust or much faith in America "turning"
places into liberal democracies.]{.underline}** What if Ukraine, the
people of Ukraine, want to live in a pro-American liberal democracy? If
Ukraine becomes a pro-American liberal democracy, and a member of nato,
and a member of the E.U., the Russians will consider that categorically
unacceptable. If there were no nato expansion and no E.U. expansion, and
Ukraine just became a liberal democracy and was friendly with the United
States and the West more generally, it could probably get away with
that. [You want to understand that there is a three-prong strategy at
play here: E.U. expansion, nato expansion, and turning Ukraine into a
pro-American liberal democracy. You keep saying "turning Ukraine into a
liberal democracy," and it seems like that's an issue for the Ukrainians
to decide. nato can decide whom it admits, but we saw in 2014 that it
appeared as if many Ukrainians wanted to be considered part of Europe.
It would seem like almost some sort of imperialism to tell them that
they can't be a liberal democracy. **It's not imperialism; this is
great-power politics.**]{.underline} When you're a country like Ukraine
and you live next door to a great power like Russia, you have to pay
careful attention to what the Russians think, because [if you take a
stick and]{.underline} you [poke them]{.underline} in the eye[, they're
going to retaliate]{.underline}. States in the Western hemisphere
understand this full well with regard to the United States. The Monroe
Doctrine, essentially. Of course. There's no country in the Western
hemisphere that we will allow to invite a distant, great power to bring
military forces into that country. Right, but saying that America will
not allow countries in the Western hemisphere, most of them democracies,
to decide what kind of foreign policy they have---you can say that's
good or bad, but that is imperialism, right? We're essentially saying
that we have some sort of say over how democratic countries run their
business. We do have that say, and, in fact, we overthrew democratically
elected leaders in the Western hemisphere during the Cold War because we
were unhappy with their policies. This is the way great powers behave.
Of course we did, but I'm wondering if we should be behaving that way.
When we're thinking about foreign policies, should we be thinking about
trying to create a world where neither the U.S. nor Russia is behaving
that way? That's not the way the world works. When you try to create a
world that looks like that, [you end up with the disastrous policies
that the United States pursued during the unipolar moment.]{.underline}
We went around the world trying to create liberal democracies. [Our main
focus, of course, was in the greater Middle East, and you know how well
that worked out. **Not very well**.]{.underline} I think it would be
difficult to say that America's policy in the Middle East in the past
seventy-five years since the end of the Second World War, or in the past
thirty years since the end of the Cold War, has been to create liberal
democracies in the Middle East. I think that's what the Bush Doctrine
was about during the unipolar moment. In Iraq. But not in the
Palestinian territories, or Saudi Arabia, or Egypt, or anywhere else,
right? No---well, not in Saudi Arabia and not in Egypt. To start with,
the Bush Doctrine basically said that if we could create a liberal
democracy in Iraq, it would have a domino effect, and countries such as
Syria, Iran, and eventually Saudi Arabia and Egypt would turn into
democracies. That was the basic philosophy behind the Bush Doctrine. The
Bush Doctrine was not just designed to turn Iraq into a democracy. We
had a much grander scheme in mind. We can debate how much the people who
were in charge in the Bush Administration really wanted to turn the
Middle East into a bunch of democracies, and really thought that was
going to happen. My sense was that there was not a lot of actual
enthusiasm about turning Saudi Arabia into a democracy. Well, I think
focussing on Saudi Arabia is taking the easy case from your perspective.
That was the most difficult case from America's perspective, because
Saudi Arabia has so much leverage over us because of oil, and it's
certainly not a democracy. But the Bush Doctrine, if you go look at what
we said at the time, was predicated on the belief that we could
democratize the greater Middle East. It might not happen overnight, but
it would eventually happen. I guess my point would be actions speak
louder than words, and, whatever Bush's flowery speeches said, I don't
feel like the policy of the United States at any point in its recent
history has been to try and insure liberal democracies around the world.
There's a big difference between how the United States behaved during
the unipolar moment and how it's behaved in the course of its history. I
agree with you when you talk about American foreign policy in the course
of its broader history, but the unipolar moment was a very special time.
I believe that during the unipolar moment, we were deeply committed to
spreading democracy. With Ukraine, it's very important to understand
that, up until 2014, we did not envision nato expansion and E.U.
expansion as a policy that was aimed at containing Russia. Nobody
seriously thought that Russia was a threat before February 22, 2014.
nato expansion, E.U. expansion, and turning Ukraine and Georgia and
other countries into liberal democracies were all about creating a giant
zone of peace that spread all over Europe and included Eastern Europe
and Western Europe. It was not aimed at containing Russia. What happened
is that [this major crisis broke out, and we had to assign blame, and of
course we were never going to blame ourselves. We were going to blame
the Russians. So we invented this story that Russia was bent on
aggression in Eastern Europe. Putin is interested in creating a greater
Russia, or maybe even re-creating the Soviet Union. Let's turn to that
time and the annexation of Crimea. I was reading an old article where
you wrote, "According to the prevailing wisdom in the West, the Ukraine
Crisis can be blamed almost entirely on Russian aggression. Russian
president Vladimir Putin, the argument goes, annexed Crimea out of a
longstanding desire to resuscitate the Soviet Empire, and he may
eventually go after the rest of Ukraine as well as other countries in
Eastern Europe."]{.underline} And then you say, "But this account is
wrong." [Does anything that's happened in the last couple weeks make you
think that account was closer to the truth than you might have thought?
Oh, I think I was right. **I think the evidence is clear that we did not
think he was an aggressor before February 22, 2014.** This is a story
that we invented so that we could blame him.]{.underline} My argument is
that **[the West, especially the United States, is principally
responsible for this disaster]{.underline}**. But no American
policymaker, and hardly anywhere in the American foreign-policy
establishment, is going to want to acknowledge that line of argument,
and they will say that the Russians are responsible.

### Yes, Recession

#### Recession now\-\--inflation, debt, and unsustainable work-at-home practices prove.

**Tate 6/30, Kristin Tate is a visiting fellow at the Independent
Women's Voice and a libertarian writer, "Young Americans are in for a
rude awakening with the coming recession," 6/30/2022,

AJS**

Societal legends are born out of challenging times. The Great Recession
bore out not only the difficulties of American capitalism, but provided
a myth among millennials of living through uniquely bad times. The
current crop of young adults has known the comfort and ease their
parents' work afforded them. A serious recession is something for which
most in that age cohort have done little planning. [The unsustainability
of work-from-home, low-output and overpaid jobs, massive student loan
debts accumulated for prestige, and the effects of the pandemic will
come to bear soon.]{.underline} For many young people who have known
nothing but relative ease, [the coming years will be a harsh reality
check]{.underline}.

Many under-40s seemed to enjoy a "Goldilocks" view of the American
economy. [Any major pressure]{.underline} --- from 9/11, to the 2008
financial crash, to massive money printing, to the pandemic ---
[appeared to be solvable]{.underline}, for the most part,
[through]{.underline} a combination of economic [stimulus spending and
smoke and mirrors at the Federal Reserve.]{.underline} While each of the
above came with its own economic pain, a [low-inflation,
moderate-growth]{.underline} future appeared inevitable for millennials
and Generation Z --- especially for those with a college education.
However, this type of economic growth [cannot remain
forever]{.underline}. [The current runaway inflation shows just the
tip]{.underline} of the iceberg [of federal
irresponsibility]{.underline}, which we are already paying for as a
massive unlevied tax.

[The U.S. will tumble into a full-blown recession in 2023 as inflation
soars, 70 percent of economists predict.]{.underline} The past two years
are a reminder that economic policy has consequences. The pandemic
ushered in full-force Keynesian economics. [The Fed grew the money
supply by a whopping 42 percent in 2020 and 2021, while keeping interest
rates low. Trillions of dollars in emergency pandemic
funding]{.underline}, capped by President Biden's 2021 American Rescue
Plan, [saturated the economy with cheap dollars.]{.underline}

At first, it appeared that the rapid growth of government spending,
money printing and federal power that ballooned during the pandemic
would aid white-collar Americans. [Being able to work from home or
receive enhanced unemployment was an extension of the Goldilocks
fallacy]{.underline}. Even the inflationary proposed partial forgiveness
of student loan debt tracks along the same general benefit that
college-educated young people derived from the pandemic. But just as
2008 burst their parents' dream of real estate empires, so will 2022 or
2023 tear apart the uniquely advantageous position that young,
upper-middle class Americans currently enjoy.

When the reckoning comes, it will be especially harsh on millennials and
Gen Zers, who will be left without the safety net to which they have
grown accustomed. The white-collar lifestyle of \$14 margaritas,
DoorDash and their parents subsidizing a tiny yet expensive apartment in
New York City, Washington or San Francisco is not sustainable for most
families during a recession. This is not to say that a young person
can't enjoy a night out with friends or an expensive avocado toast every
once in a while. However, [the lack of foresight shown by many in the
youngest two generations is unique]{.underline} in recent history.

All hope is not lost for young people; after all, some have
recession-resistant jobs or have been responsible with their money.
However, that won't be the case for most. A pre-pandemic survey found
[most Gen Zers have less than \$1,000 in their bank accounts, and almost
half have nothing at all]{.underline}. The 22.5 million young people
under 35 who attended college carry an average of \$28,000 in student
loan debt. Millennials also carry over \$27,000 in average non-mortgage
debt.

Spending habits among the young are heavier on convenience, something
that will come crashing down when the next recession hits. [Almost
three-quarters of millennials and 65 percent of Generation Z live
paycheck to paycheck]{.underline}. Rapidly increasing rental and
mortgage costs and the overall pressure of inflation will be the coup de
grace of a 1970s-esque stagflation spiral. [The last two decades have
allowed for a false understanding of cost-of-living expenses that is
unsustainable.]{.underline}

At the same time, the hope of working from home indefinitely will begin
to dry up. When the recession hits, [employers will prioritize essential
and practical jobs over self-important ones.]{.underline} Layoffs will
ensue and other positions will die through attrition. Working from home
and demanding large salaries for relatively easy work will be
increasingly difficult.

Just as the lean Carter presidency years created a generation of
conservative leaders, President Biden is looking at a similar fate.
Biden declared that he wants to stand out in history. Young people may
experience a moment similar to one that their parents did in the 1980s;
they can double down on failure under Biden, or entertain voting for a
young, energetic and competent Republican.

And for those who are currently privileged, there will be a chance to
understand a crucial lesson: The laws of economics are real. Efforts by
Democrats to ignore them may cause voters to abandon the party

### No, Recession

#### No recession\-\--survey data [recovery now]{.underline}

KCabrera

Another month, another round of flash purchasing managers' indexes
(PMIs) giving an early read into major **[economies']{.underline}**
business activity. Though they [**mostly ticked down in June**,
prompting more **recessionary chatter**, their **levels** still
**indicate overall expansion**.]{.underline} It may not be gangbusters,
but stocks don't need perfection to mount a recovery from this year's
downturn---just for reality to beat dreary expectations. PMIs are
surveys that aim to measure growth's breadth[. Readings above 50
indicate the majority of surveyed **firms reported expanding business
activity**, with growth (and contraction) **theoretically accelerating
the further readings drift from that marker**]{.underline}. PMIs don't
say anything about how much their businesses grew (or shrank), only that
they did, so they are a timely but loose estimate of economic activity
at best. Among the various readings, the composite PMI combines services
and manufacturing, but it is a narrower measure of their "output" that
focuses only on production. The services and manufacturing PMIs are
broader, including new orders, backlogs, suppliers' delivery times and
employment. That is why, for example, the composites for June's US, UK
and eurozone PMIs can be below each of their services and manufacturing
PMIs. Exhibit 1 shows major economies' PMIs remain above 50---though
they are down from the spring, implying deceleration (Japan excepted).
[The US and eurozone's June **flash composites**, released with only 85%
-- 90% of responses in, fell to the low 50s, **continuing a generally
slower trend.** This includes both services, which comprise the bulk of
developed market economies, and manufacturing]{.underline}. But while
low-50s PMIs aren't historically robust, they generally coincide with
pedestrian growth. Exhibit 1: Major Economy PMIs \*\*\*image
omitted\*\*\* Source: FactSet and S&P Global, as of 6/23/2022. Flash
PMIs are preliminary estimates based on 85% -- 90% of responses. Also
note, the downward trend isn't global---Japan's composite PMI rose and
the UK's was flat. Japan's lift was services-based as COVID restrictions
eased there. Reopening-related boosts helped buoy UK services, too, as
more workers returned to the office and patronized surrounding
businesses. [However, Japanese and UK **manufacturing weakened alongside
the rest of the developed world** as Chinese lockdowns hit global supply
chains.]{.underline} As a whole, the picture here appears mixed.
Business activity growth is less broad-based. But through mid-June at
least, the pockets of strength seemingly outnumbered the pockets of
weakness. Whether that translates to actual economic growth, we will see
when output data roll in. For many, **[this isn't exactly
consoling.]{.underline}** As we wrote in early June for the eurozone,
there are some discrepancies between "soft" survey data and "hard" sales
and volume data, with some signs of contraction in the latter. In the US
and UK, May retail sales fell -0.3% m/m (nominal) and -0.5% (real),
respectively.\[i\] But we don't think this is conclusive, as it [may
reflect a continuing shift back to services spending from goods---**a
return to normal, not necessarily weakness**]{.underline}. Hard services
data tend to lag, which is why timelier PMIs are helpful and looking at
both provides a fuller picture, if only in broad brushstrokes. Based on
our read of all the data so far, it is premature to declare a recession
is underway. [Some quantitative efforts]{.underline} to derive GDP from
monthly indicators---like the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow---[might seem to
disagree, but these models aren't air-tight]{.underline}. GDPNow
currently predicts 0.3% annualized Q2 growth given available data.\[ii\]
But the most telling component, personal consumption expenditures---71%
of GDP---won't be released until month end, and that is just May's
number.\[iii\] More broadly, these nowcast models are young, with a
spotty record of accuracy. The New York Fed's proved so inaccurate that
they have temporarily ceased publication, pending methodological
improvements. The St. Louis Fed's attempt currently estimates 3.9%
annualized growth in Q2, but neither it nor the Atlanta Fed's model
predicted Q1's inventory-fueled GDP contraction.\[iv\] Absent a
foolproof tool, investors must survey the entire landscape and make
their best judgments. For now, we are inclined to interpret PMIs as more
evidence economies aren't uniformly weak despite well-documented
struggles. [Notably, though, even **survey data have some weak points**
worth monitoring. Deteriorating new orders may suggest demand is
faltering---**but it is too early to tell**]{.underline}. Relative
services strength may be fading, but whether that is normalization
following the initial reopening boom or something worse---e.g., cost of
living pressures taking a more lasting toll---remains to be seen.
Meanwhile, [manufacturing's downtrend, beset by component shortages,
could reverse as supply chains recover. Some businesses, particularly in
the consumer world, apparently overstocked trying to compensate amid
surging goods demand.]{.underline} They may just have inventory
overhangs they need to work through---a more temporary hiccup than
needing to get lean to correct prior excess. We also see some other
encouraging nuggets. The PMI surveys indicate falling backorders, which
could be signaling easing supply chain and price pressures. This may be
occurring as headwinds from China's choppy reopening fade. One hint: The
New York Fed's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, which aggregates
transportation costs, input-output prices and other measures---like
PMIs' delivery times, backlogs and inventories---to gauge the overall
intensity of bottlenecks' disruption on world trade. (Exhibit 2) [While
still at lofty levels, **it has started subsiding and may be past its
peak**.]{.underline} Exhibit 2: Global Supply Chain Pressures Elevated,
but Easing \*\*\*image omitted\*\*\* Source: Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, as of 5/18/2022. Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, January 1998
-- May 2022. For investors, the most salient aspect of the latest PMI
releases may be their accompanying bearish sentiment. Given the market
environment, it isn't surprising. But we still think it is notable that
PMI coverage widely extrapolates imminent recession---which the data
don't confirm, at least yet. The evidence, as we have explored, is more
mixed. **[While recession is possible, we think the global economy's
resilience is just as remarkable given the challenges it has faced year
to date.]{.underline}** This is an underappreciated positive to us[.
Recession uncertainty has undoubtedly weighed on markets]{.underline}
lately. But by the same token, it lowers the expectations bar reality
needs to clear to surprise stocks positively. In our view, increasing
economic clarity in the second half---even if it just muddles
through---will likely provide relief.

"Assessing the time intervals between economic recessions",
<https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232615>) KCabrera

[Recessions]{.underline} are economic contractions following a period of
economic expansion. They [are part of the business cycle, **and do not
feature a regular periodicity**.]{.underline} Market
[adjustments]{.underline} and [policy measures are capable to revitalize
the economy]{.underline} and **[turn around the trend of economic
decline]{.underline}**. In the modern economic history of the U[.S.,
policy makers have tried time and time again to address
unemployme]{.underline}nt and [**declining incomes with recovery
measures** in the New Deal, the employment act, new institutional
frameworks, the Bretton Woods agreement, etc]{.underline}. \[1, 2\]. In
addition to reforms and new regulations, [different instruments of
**fiscal control can be activated**]{.underline}, such as adjustments in
taxation, public expenditure and debt [management to **foster economic
growth**]{.underline} \[3\]. The efficiency of all these policies can be
measured with so-called fiscal multipliers, which behave differently
during expansions and recessions \[4, 5\]. However, these **[multipliers
do not allow us to estimate the time and probability of the next
recession.]{.underline}** The lifetime of a system is defined as the
time that a system can carry out its function before going into a
failure state \[6, 7\]. In this work, the failure state corresponds with
a recession event, and the age of the system is the time that the system
has already worked properly, i.e., the time that the economy is in
expansion. There are multiple approaches to predict business cycle
turning points, such as econometric techniques \[8\], the spread between
short-term and long-term interest rates captured in the yield function
\[9\], or stochastic simulation \[10, 11\]. [Typically, the probability
of a recession is determined based on the several indicator variables,
such as stock prices, credit market activity, or employment and interest
rate]{.underline} \[11\]. These [techniques are valuable, **but they do
not capture explicitly the effect** of system age]{.underline}, system
aging, or [the effects of policy and market interventions on the state
of the economy]{.underline}. There is in fact evidence that the
termination probability of recessions is dependent on its duration \[12,
13\]. This dependence can be captured by different types of survival
models, such as the proportional hazard model \[14\] and the accelerated
failure time model \[15\], which include the effect of covariates in the
hazard function. Aforementioned [models are however not able to include
the effect of interventions following an event on system
age]{.underline}. Business cycle durations have typically been modeled
using Markov switching processes \[16, 17\]. Here, we use an alternative
approach based on Generalized Renewal Processes (GRP) to model the
inter-arrival times of recessions. This method allows us to integrate
explicitly the effect of policy interventions and to determine if aging
is a real process happening in economic systems. GRPs integrate
simultaneously two sources of stochastic variability in system
performance: deterioration through aging and restoration by means of
policy interventions. [**System deterioration** can occur through
different types of aging processes]{.underline}. No aging indicates that
the age of the system has no effect on the residual lifetime. The
no-aging property implies a system with no memory, a constant failure
rate, and lifetimes distributed according to the exponential
distribution. In reliability analysis, [positive aging is much more
common and means that the expected residual lifetime decreases with
age]{.underline}. System restoration deals with repair actions that
improve the system after failure. The literature often distinguishes
between perfect repair and minimal repair \[18\]. Perfect repair is
applicable, for instance, to engineering systems that consist of a
single component that can be replaced, resulting in a system as good as
new. Minimal repair requires the replacement of only these components
that failed; minimal repair is a reasonable assumption for systems
consisting of multiple components all of which have their own failure
properties, leaving the system in a state as bad as before the failure.
[Minimal repair and perfect repair are however specific cases and in
realistic settings the degree of restoration can be better described by
general repair and the corresponding stochastic process, the
GRP]{.underline}. The effectiveness of interventions in general repair
can take arbitrary values, and general renewal theory extends the
classical renewal theory by including the notion of rejuvenation,
indicating the performance of the system after interventions. This idea
was firstly presented in \[19\] and requires to introduce the concept of
virtual age, a function that reflects how interventions affect the real
age of the system. In the literature, a Weibull-GRP (WGRP) model is
usually fitted to observed data in order to infer lifetime probabilities
\[20--23\]. The restoration process is commonly captured by a
rejuvenation parameter \[22, 24, 25\], whereas the deterioration of the
system is reflected by the shape and scale parameters of the Weibull
distribution regardless of the restoration process \[20--22\]. The GRP
can also be used in an optimization context, where policies are searched
for that minimize intervention costs while maintaining certain levels of
system performance \[24, 26--28\]. In reliability analysis and
engineering, the Weibull distribution has typically been used to
describe the functioning of a serial system that operates well as long
as all components operate correctly \[29\]. In this work, we propose to
model the arrival time of recessions by means of a GRP based on the
Gumbel distribution. The Gumbel distribution is able to describe a
parallel system that stops operating once all components fail, and we
use the abstraction of a parallel system as a stylized representation of
the economy. The duration of an expansion period is affected by market
adjustments taking place during the preceding recession as well as by
the policies and reforms introduced to mitigate the causes of this
recession. We therefore argue that the periods between consecutive
recessions do not constitute a stationary process. We deduce the
distribution of the GRP based on the Gumbel distribution, and show how
the parameters of the statistical model can be estimated. Importantly,
we propose a novel goodness of fit test to demonstrate that the observed
recessions of the American and European markets can be represented by
the Gumbel-based GRP. We show that the GRP outperforms several
stationary distributions, and [in addition to the recession incidence
rate over time, we also estimate the expected time of the next
recession.]{.underline}

### AT: Decline Causes War

#### Economic decline doesn't cause war\-\--Covid has weakened countries.

**Walt 20,** Stephen Walt is the Renée Belfer professor of international
relations at Harvard University, "Will a Global Depression Trigger
Another World War?," 5/13/2020,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/>,
AJS

But war could still be much less likely. [The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Barry Posen]{.underline} has already considered the likely
impact of the current pandemic on the probability of war, and he
[believes COVID-19 is more likely to promote peace instead.]{.underline}
He argues that [the current pandemic is affecting all the major powers
adversely, which means it isn't creating tempting windows of opportunity
for unaffected states while leaving others weaker and therefore
vulnerable.]{.underline} Instead, it is making all governments more
pessimistic about their short- to medium-term prospects. [Because states
often go to war out of sense of overconfidence]{.underline} (however
misplaced it sometimes turns out to be), [pandemic-induced pessimism
should be conducive to peace.]{.underline}

Moreover, by its very nature [war requires states to assemble lots of
people in close proximity]{.underline}---at training camps, military
bases, mobilization areas, ships at sea, etc.---and [that's not
something you want to do in the middle of a pandemic.]{.underline} For
the moment at least, beleaguered governments of all types are focusing
on convincing their citizens they are doing everything in their power to
protect the public from the disease. Taken together, these
considerations might explain why [even an impulsive and headstrong
warmaker like Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman has gotten more
interested in winding down his brutal and unsuccessful military campaign
in Yemen.]{.underline}

Posen adds that [COVID-19 is also likely to reduce international trade
in the short to medium term]{.underline}. Those who believe economic
interdependence is a powerful barrier to war might be alarmed by this
development, but he points out that [trade issues have been a source of
considerable friction in recent years---especially between the United
States and China]{.underline}---and [a degree of decoupling might reduce
tensions somewhat]{.underline} and cause the odds of war to recede.

[The Own Goal Recession: May 1937--June 1938]{.underline} Duration: 13
months GDP decline: 10% 5 Peak unemployment rate: 20% 5 Reasons and
causes: [Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies had **secured a
recovery from the Great Depression** after 1933]{.underline}, albeit an
uneven and incomplete one. In 1936-**1937 [policymakers changed
course]{.underline}**[, more preoccupied with cutting budget deficits
and heading off inflation than with the dangers of a depressive
relapse]{.underline}. 5 Following a tax increase in 1935 and Social
Security payroll deductions starting in 1937, the budget deficit shrank
from 5.4% of GDP in 1936 to 0.1% of GDP by 1938. 6 7 Meanwhile, the
Federal Reserve in 1936 doubled the reserve requirement ratios for
banks, thus curbing lending with the stated aim of preventing \"an
injurious credit expansion.\" 5 Perhaps [most damagingly of all, the
U.S. Treasury began the same year to sterilize gold inflows, ending
brisk money supply growth that had supported the expansion]{.underline}.
8 Industrial production began falling in September; it would decline 32%
in the course of the recession[. The **stock market crashed** in
October.]{.underline} The recession ended after policymakers rolled back
the increase in reserve requirements and gold sterilization as well as
fiscal austerity. 5 [The V-Day Recession]{.underline}: February
1945--October 1945 Duration: Eight months GDP decline: 10.9% 9 Peak
unemployment rate: 3.8% 10 Reasons and causes: The 1945 [recession
reflected massive cuts in U.S. government spending and employment toward
the end]{.underline} and immediately [after World War II.]{.underline}
Federal spending fell 40% in 1946 and 38% in 1947 while the private
sector\'s output grew rapidly. 11 The [**severity of the downturn
remains open to question** because much of the eliminated spending
represented wartime production]{.underline} that did not serve to
increase living standards. 12 The elimination of price controls in 1946
artificially depressed output as adjusted for inflation, while the
unemployment rate remained low in part because women left the workforce
in large numbers (and often unwillingly). 13 14 15 [The Post-War Brakes
Tap Recession]{.underline}: November 1948--October 1949 Duration: 11
months GDP decline: 1.7% 16 Peak unemployment rate: 7.9% 17 Reasons and
Causes: The first phase of the post-war boom was in **[some ways
comparable to the economic recovery from the COVID-19
pandemic.]{.underline}** Amid a backlog of consumer demand suppressed
during the war and a shortage of production capacity, the collapse of
wartime price controls fueled an abrupt surge of inflation by mid-1946.
18 The annualized inflation rate rose from 3.3% in June 1946 to 11.6%
two months later and 19% at its peak in April 1947. 19 Policymakers only
responded in the second half of 1947, and when they did their efforts to
tighten credit ultimately led to a relatively mild recession as
consumers and producers retrenched. 20 [The M\*A\*S\*H\*
Recession]{.underline}: July 1953--May 1954 Duration: 10 months GDP
decline: 2.7% 16 Peak unemployment rate: 5.9% 17 Reasons and causes: The
wind-down of the Korean War caused [government spending to decline
dramatically]{.underline}, lowering the federal budget deficit from 1.7%
of GDP in fiscal 1953 to 0.3% a year later. Meanwhile, the Federal
Reserve tightened monetary policy in 1953. 21 [The Investment Bust
Recession]{.underline}: August 1957--April 1958 Duration: Eight months
GDP decline: 3.7% 16 Peak unemployment rate: 7.4% 17 Reasons and causes:
The end of the Korean War unleashed a global investment boom marked by a
surge in exports of U.S. capital goods. 22 The Fed responded by
tightening monetary policy as the inflation rate rose from 0.4% in March
1956 to 3.7% a year later. 21 19 Fiscal policy focused on limiting
budget deficits produced a surplus of 0.7% of GDP in 1957. 21 The 1957
Asian Flu pandemic killed 70,000 to 100,000 Americans in 1957, and
industrial production slumped late that year and early in 1958. 23 The
dramatic drop in domestic demand and evolving consumer expectations led
to the failure of the Ford Edsel, the beginning of the end for
Detroit\'s auto industry dominance. 24 [The sharp worldwide recession
contributed to a **foreign trade deficit**]{.underline}. The recession
ended after policymakers eased fiscal and monetary constraints on
growth. 21 The \'Rolling Adjustment\' Recession: April 1960--February
1961 Duration: 10 months GDP decline: 1.6% 16 Peak unemployment rate:
6.9% 17 Reasons and causes: This relatively mild recession was named for
the so-called \"rolling adjustment\" in U.S. industrial sectors tied to
consumers\' diminished demand for domestic autos amid growing
competition from inexpensive imports. Like most other recessions, it was
preceded by higher interest rates, with the Fed increasing the federal
funds rate from 1.75% in mid-1958 to 4% by the end of 1959. 25 Fiscal
policy also tightened at the end of President Dwight Eisenhower\'s
second term, from a deficit of 2.6% of GDP in 1959 to a surplus of 0.1%
a year later. 26 The Guns and Butter Recession: December 1969--November
1970 Duration: 11 months GDP decline: 0.6% 16 Peak unemployment rate:
5.9% 17 Reasons and causes: Military spending increased in the late
1960s amid growing U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and alongside
high expenditures on domestic policy initiatives. 27 As a result, the
federal budget deficit rose from 1.1% of GDP in 1967 to 2.9% in 1968,
while inflation increased from 3.1% in 1967 to 4.3% a year later and
5.3% by 1970. The Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate from
5% in March 1968 to more than 9% by August 1969. By early 1971, the Fed
had lowered the federal funds rate back below 4%, aiding the recovery.
26 The Oil Embargo Recession: November 1973--March 1975 Duration: 16
months GDP decline: 3% 28 Peak unemployment rate: 8.6% 17 Reasons and
causes: This long, deep recession began following the start of the Arab
Oil Embargo, which would quadruple crude prices. That tipped the balance
for an economy struggling with the devaluation of the dollar amid high
U.S. trade and budget deficits and slipping domestic crude output. 29
The collapse of the Bretton Woods Agreement fixing currency exchange
rates contributed to a rise in U.S. inflation from 2.4% in August 1972
to 7.4% a year later, causing the Fed to double the federal funds rate
to 10% between late 1972 and mid-1973. 19 30 After increasing the
federal funds rate to 13% in the first half of 1974, the Fed cut it to
5.25% in under a year. 28 Inflation and unemployment remained elevated
after the recession ended, ushering in stagflation. Unemployment reached
9% in May of 1975, after the declared end of the recession. 17 The Iran
and Volcker Recession, Part 1: January 1980--July 1980 Duration: Six
months GDP decline: 2.2% 31 Peak unemployment rate: 7.8% 17 Reasons and
causes: Accommodative monetary policy aimed at alleviating rising
unemployment pushed U.S. inflation to 7% by early 1979, just before the
Iranian Revolution caused oil prices to double. 32 The Federal Reserve
was already raising rates when Paul Volcker was named Fed chair in
August 1979, and the rate went from 10.5% at the time of his appointment
to 17.5% by April 1980. 33 This short recession formally ended as the
Fed dropped the fed funds rate back down to 9.5% by August of 1980, but
inflation stayed high and the Volcker Fed wasn\'t done. Part 2 of
Double-Dip Recession: July 1981--November 1982 Duration: 16 months GDP
decline: 2.9% 31 Peak unemployment rate: 10.8% 17 Reasons and causes: By
the fourth quarter of 1980 inflation was up to 11.1%, prompting the
Federal Reserve to raise the fed funds rate to 19% by July 1981. 33 As
the downturn worsened and joblessness climbed, Volcker resisted repeated
demands in Congress to change course. 34 By October 1982 inflation had
declined to 5%, while unemployment would remain above 10% until
mid-1983. 35 17 Most economists today accept Volcker\'s arguments at the
time that failure to control inflation and restore the Fed\'s
credibility would have led to continued economic underperformance. 36
The Gulf War Recession: July 1990--March 1991 Duration: Eight months GDP
decline: 1.5% 37 Peak unemployment rate: 6.8% 17 Reasons and causes:
This relatively mild recession began a month before Iraq invaded Kuwait,
and the resulting oil price shock may have contributed to a
frustratingly lackluster recovery. The Fed had raised the federal funds
rate from 6.5% in February 1988 to 9.75% in May 1989 in an effort to
contain inflation, which rose from 2.2% in 1986 to 3.9% for 1990. 38 The
Dot-Bomb Recession: March 2001--November 2001 Duration: Eight months GDP
decline: 0.3% Peak unemployment rate: 5.5% 17 Reasons and causes: The
collapse of the dotcom bubble contributed to one of the mildest
recessions on record following what was then the longest economic
expansion in U.S. history. 39 The Fed raised the fed funds rate from
4.75% in early 1999 to 6.5% by July 2000. The Sept. 11 attacks and the
associated economic disruptions may have hastened the recession\'s end
by encouraging the Fed to keep cutting the fed funds rate. The benchmark
rate reached a low of 1% by mid-2003. 40 The Great Recession: December
2007--June 2009 Duration: Eighteen months GDP decline: 4.3% 41 Peak
unemployment rate: 9.5% 41 Reasons and causes: The nationwide downturn
in U.S. housing prices triggered a global financial crisis, a bear
market in stocks that had the S&P 500 down 57% at the lows, and the
worst economic downturn since the recession of 1937-38. 41 Global
investment flows into the U.S. had kept market rates low, likely
encouraging unscrupulous mortgage underwriting and mortgage-backed
securities marketing practices. 42 Oil prices spiked to record highs by
mid-2008 and then crashed, depressing the U.S. oil industry. The
COVID-19 Recession: February 2020--April 2020 Duration: Two months
Reasons and causes: The COVID-19 pandemic spread to the U.S. in March
2020, and the resulting travel and work restrictions caused employment
to plummet, triggering an unusually short but sharp recession. 43 The
unemployment rate climbed from 3.5% in February 2020 to 14.7% in April
2020 but was back below 4% by the end of 2021, capped by \$5 trillion in
pandemic relief spending. 17 44 In addition, quantitative easing by the
Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet from \$4.1 trillion in
February 2020 to nearly \$9 trillion by the end of 2021, complementing a
federal funds rate that remained near zero until March 2022. 45 What Is
the Average Length of a Recession? [The U.S. has experienced **34
recessions** since 1857]{.underline} according to the NBER, varying in
length from two months (February to April 2020) to more than five years
(October 1873 to March 1879). The average recession has lasted 17
months, while the six recessions since 1980 have lasted less than 10
months on average. 1 Which Stocks Tend Fare Better During a Recession[?
Companies in the consumer staples, health care, and utilities sectors,
which see **relatively small fluctuations** in demand for economic
reasons]{.underline}, tend to [**fare best** during
recessions]{.underline}, and their [stocks have **outperformed** during
past downturns as a result]{.underline}. 46 47 Do Recessions Always
Coincide With Bear Markets? A bear market is commonly defined as a
sustained drop of 20% or more from a market peak. Of the 25 bear markets
since 1928, 14 have overlapped with recessions. 48 \*\*\*image
omitted\*\*\* The Bottom Line As the history of recessions over the past
century suggests, they\'re almost always preceded by monetary policy
tightening in the form of rising interest rates. [Fiscal contractions,
whether they involve lower government spending, higher taxes, or both,
have also played a role]{.underline}. This is not to automatically
deprecate such policies when they lead to a recession. In some cases, as
during the 1970s, the long-run alternative to immediate economic pain
may be even less palatable. In others, as with the end of World War II
and the Korean War, there may be no easy way or no will to find
immediate alternatives to high military spending. That doesn\'t change
the fact that [**most modern recessions** have occurred in response to
some combination of rising interest rates, lower budget deficits, and
higher energy prices.]{.underline}

### AT: Diversionary Theory

#### Diversionary theory is wrong\-\--too big a gamble and countries weak

relations at Harvard University, "Will a Global Depression Trigger
Another World War?," 5/13/2020,

AJS

[One familiar argument is the]{.underline} so-called
[diversionary]{.underline} (or "scapegoat") [theory of war.]{.underline}
It suggests that leaders who are worried about their popularity at home
will try to divert attention from their failures by provoking a crisis
with a foreign power and maybe even using force against it. Drawing on
this logic, some Americans now worry that President Donald Trump will
decide to attack a country like Iran or Venezuela in the run-up to the
presidential election and especially if he thinks he's likely to lose.

This outcome strikes me as unlikely, even if one ignores the logical and
empirical flaws in the theory itself. [War is always a
gamble]{.underline}, and [should things go badly---even a little
bit---it would hammer the last nail in the coffin of Trump's declining
fortunes.]{.underline} Moreover, [none of the countries Trump might
consider going after pose a]{.underline}n imminent [threat to U.S.
security]{.underline}, and even [his staunchest supporters]{.underline}
may [wonder why he is wasting time and money]{.underline} going after
Iran or Venezuela at a moment [when]{.underline} thousands of [Americans
are dying]{.underline} preventable deaths at home. Even a [successful
military action won't put Americans back to work]{.underline},
[create]{.underline} the sort of [testing-and-tracing
regime]{.underline} that competent governments around the world have
been able to implement already, [or hasten the development of a
vaccine]{.underline}. [The same logic is likely to guide the decisions
of other world leaders too.]{.underline}

### AT: Military Keynesianism

#### Military Keynesianism is wrong\-\--war fails to generate enough growth and other methods solve.

**Walt 20,** Stephen Walt is the Renée Belfer professor of international
relations at Harvard University, "Will a Global Depression Trigger
Another World War?," 5/13/2020,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/>,
AJS

Another familiar folk theory is "military Keynesianism." [War generates
a lot of economic demand]{.underline}, and [it can sometimes lift
depressed economies]{.underline} out of the doldrums and back toward
prosperity and full employment. The obvious case in point here is World
War II, which did help the U.S economy finally escape the quicksand of
the Great Depression. Those who are convinced that great powers go to
war primarily to keep Big Business (or the arms industry) happy are
naturally drawn to this sort of argument, and they might worry that
governments looking at bleak economic forecasts will try to restart
their economies through some sort of military adventure.

I doubt it. [It takes a really big war to generate a significant
stimulus]{.underline}, and [it is hard to imagine any country launching
a large-scale war]{.underline}---with all its attendant risks---at a
moment [when debt levels are already soaring.]{.underline} More
importantly, [there are]{.underline} lots of [easier and more direct
ways to stimulate the economy]{.underline}---infrastructure spending,
unemployment insurance, even "helicopter payments"---and [launching a
war has to be one of the least efficient methods]{.underline} available.
[The threat of war usually spooks investors]{.underline} too, which any
politician with their eye on the stock market would be loath to do.

for the next generation, and with good cause.

## Climate Change Ups

### No Extinction

#### Climate change won't cause extinction\-\--Recent decrease in natural disasters proves.

Starting tomorrow, on Halloween, government leaders from around the
world will meet in Glasgow, Scotland, for the annual U.N. Climate Change
Conference, which this year will feature some of
its [scariest](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58130705) stories
yet. The only problem is that when you take the mask off the harrowing
claims that climate change poses an imminent existential threat to
humanity, they don't hold up. [The most dire climate-change predictions,
which fuel the apocalyptic discourse that surrounds the issue, stem from
a climate model known as RCP 8.5.]{.underline} According to RCP 8.5, by
the year 2100, the Earth
will [warm](https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/rcp-8-5-business-as-usual-or-a-worst-case-scenario/) 4.3
degrees Celsius, causing sea levels to surge and making many countries
too hot to inhabit. But [models are only as solid as the assumptions on
which they rest, and RCP 8.5's assumptions are wild, to put it
mildly.]{.underline} [The
model [assumes](https://issues.org/climate-change-scenarios-lost-touch-reality-pielke-ritchie/) that,
despite coal's declining market position
and [usage](https://financialpost.com/opinion/ross-mckitrick-the-flaw-in-relying-on-a-worst-case-scenario-climate-model),
and
despite [projections](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-coal-demand-by-scenario-2010-2040) that
it will [continue to
decline](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2020/overview-and-key-findings),
worldwide per capita coal use
will [rise](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abcdd2/pdf#page=8) three-
to six-fold over the next 50 years, coming to once again power our
economies and heat our homes.]{.underline} [It assumes that [liquefied
coal](https://issues.org/climate-change-scenarios-lost-touch-reality-pielke-ritchie/) will
even fuel our
cars.]{.underline} It [assumes](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abcdd2/pdf#page=10) [that
the rebirth of the coal industry will power so much growth that, by
2100, the poorest country on Earth today will have a higher GDP than
today's wealthiest countries currently do]{.underline} (while
paradoxically also being too hot to inhabit). [And it assumes that
economic growth will be
much [less](https://judithcurry.com/2015/12/13/a-closer-look-at-scenario-rcp8-5/) energy-efficient
than it
is [today](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.GDP.PUSE.KO.PP.KD?locations=US-DE-JP-CN-CA),
which would represent the reversal of a decades-long trend.]{.underline}
It should go without saying that [none of these are even remotely safe
assumptions.]{.underline} Similarly, many [dire predictions about
climate change]{.underline}'s effects on weather patterns [are
overwrought.]{.underline} It is true that [the [latest
report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter_11.pdf) from
the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change notes that fire
weather, heavy precipitation, ecological and agricultural droughts, and
heat waves
are [increasing](https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/how-to-understand-the-new-ipcc-report-1e3) in
frequency. But it is also true that while heat waves have become more
frequent since 1960, the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s remains
the [peak](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/downloads/CSSR2017_FullReport.pdf#page=191) period
of extreme heat in the U.S. Similarly, while weather conducive to
wildfires has become more frequent, the global land area burned by
wildfires has
steadily [decreased](https://wwfeu.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/wwf_fires_forests_and_the_future_report.pdf#page=8) since
the early 1900s, and much of the
recent [damage](https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-activists-blow-smoke-on-wildfire-fears-adaptation-land-11635367688?mod=hp_opin_pos_4#cxrecs_s) has
been due to poor forest-management practices]{.underline}. What's more,
there's plenty of good news that can't be fit into a spooky
climate-change story. [The IPCC's most recent report notes [no
discernible long-term
increase](https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/how-to-understand-the-new-ipcc-report-1e3)
in flooding, hydrological and meteorological droughts, hurricanes,
tornadoes, winter storms, extreme winds, thunderstorms, lightning, or
hail.]{.underline} And [humanity is better protected than it once
was]{.underline} from those natural disasters that do happen: [A recent
study published in the peer-reviewed journal Global Environmental Change
found that economic losses caused by climate-related disasters
[dropped](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378019300378)
80 percent from 1980 to 2016.]{.underline} If you can ignore the
overblown rhetoric, [there are fundamental truths to be reckoned with:
Climate change is real, and human activity does indeed contribute to it.
But irresponsible fearmongering only makes the problem harder to
address.]{.underline} According to the best evidence, [the world is on
track to hit emissions and warming levels that, as of a couple of years
ago, would have been considered a success.]{.underline} For instance,
according to leading
[industry](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/Energy-and-innovation/Outlook-for-Energy/Emissions)
[publications](https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/energy-outlook/bp-energy-outlook-2020.pdf#page=7),
energy-related-emissions projections are in line with the (much cooler)
climate
[model](https://asr.science.energy.gov/publications/program-docs/RCP4.5-Pathway.pdf)
RCP 4.5, which the 2018 U.S. National Climate Assessment
[heralded](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/national-climate-assessment-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions-will)
as a [low-emissions](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/29/)
policy-success scenario. It's likely that global "peak per capita CO2
emissions" were reached several years ago. Major independent
energy-research organizations such as the International Energy Agency
predict that annual per capita CO2 emissions will
[decline](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerpielke/2020/01/18/the-best-news-on-climate-youve-never-heard/)
in the decades to come, and it's
[likely](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerpielke/2019/11/30/global-carbon-dioxide-emissions-are-on-the-brink-of-a-long-plateau/?sh=470a8e61338d)
that global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are on the brink of a long
plateau. The best computer models
[predict](https://youtu.be/DfHTudcfrUU?t=1802) that by 2100, the Earth
will be 2.2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in 1850. That will
certainly cause environmental changes, but it doesn't constitute an
existential threat. [Nor are we humans without tools to ameliorate the
problem.]{.underline} Adaptive
engineering, [carbon](https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RSTREET243.pdf)--[offset](https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/newsroom/dem/press/release/growing-climate-solutions-act-passes-us-senate) and [water](https://www.hoover.org/research/west-needs-water-markets) markets,
and the continued growth of more environmentally conscious ways of
producing the goods and services needed for modern life can all lessen
climate change and its effects. So, as Halloween arrives amid the U.N.
Climate Change Conference this year, [leaders]{.underline} should ditch
the Grim Reaper costumes and don more reasonable attire. [With level
heads and the right policies, they can both protect the environment and
provide a better life for billions around the globe.]{.underline}

#### Adaptation solves the impacts of climate change\-\--Executive action solves

[Humans are changing the climate]{.underline} too [rapidly]{.underline}
for nature to keep up[, according to a new United Nations (UN)
report]{.underline} released on Monday. Unless greenhouse gas emissions
are quickly slashed, both humans and wildlife will no longer adapt to
the dangers of a warming planet. [The latest report from the UN's
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is based on years of
research from hundreds of scientists and follows previous landmark
assessments on the global threat of climate change.]{.underline} The new
3,675-page report authored by 270 researchers from nearly 70 nations,
[concluded that human-caused climate change is happening faster and
causing more damage than researchers previously expected]{.underline},
according to Sara Kiley Watson for Popular Science. [The report is the
second of three reviews from the IPCC.]{.underline} "With fact upon
fact, this report reveals how people and the planet are getting
clobbered by climate change," says UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres
in a statement. ["Nearly half of humanity is living in the danger
zone---now.]{.underline} Many ecosystems are at the point of no
return---now. [Unchecked carbon pollution is forcing the world's most
vulnerable on a frog march to destruction---now."]{.underline} [Climate
change is not a future abstract threat,]{.underline} per the new report,
[and is already harming communities and ecosystems around the
world.]{.underline} [In 2019, extreme weather like storms and floods
displaced more than 13 million people across Asia and Africa,
according]{.underline} to Brad Plumer and Raymond Zhong for the [New
York Times.]{.underline} [Heat and drought are threatening the food and
water supply for millions of people, and rising sea levels are
encroaching on coastal communities.]{.underline} In recent years, more
individuals have been forced to deal with [extreme weather events
link]{.underline}ed [to climate change, like the deadly heatwave that
hit the western United States last summer.]{.underline} [Anthropogenic
warming increase]{.underline}d the likelihood of floods that swept
through parts of Europe last year by up to nine times and made
Australia\'s devastating fire seasons 30 percent more likely.

"One of the most striking conclusions in our report is that we're seeing
adverse impacts that are much more widespread and much more negative
than expected," Camille Parmesan, an ecologist at the University of
Texas, Austin, and one of the researchers involved in the report, tells
the Times. The report found some regions are feeling the impacts of
climate change more than others. Between 2010 and 2020, floods,
droughts, and storms killed 15 times more people in very vulnerable
parts of Africa, South Asia, and Central and South America, than in
other parts of the world, per Matt McGrath for BBC. [A warmer planet
also presents new health risks]{.underline}, including the spread of
mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue fever to billions more people.
"This report is a dire warning about the consequences of inaction," says
Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC, in a statement. "Half measures are no
longer an option." The new analysis comes roughly 100 days since the
COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, where scientists and world leaders
aimed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and stave off the
worst effects of climate change. Since humans started burning fossil
fuels in the 19th century, global temperatures have climbed an average
of 1.1 degrees Celsius, or 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Currently, the world is
currently on pace to warm somewhere between 2 degrees and 3 degrees
Celsius by the end of the century, and a few degrees can have a big
impact on the planet.

If global warming is limited to just 2 degrees Celsius by 2100, for
example, around a fifth of [land species will be at high
risk]{.underline} of extinction, per CNN's Rachel Ramirez. If that jumps
to 4 degrees of warming, half of those animals will be threatened. Some
animals, like corals, may already be out of time to adapt.

[Though]{.underline} many of the impacts of global warming are
\"irreversible,\" according to the report, [scientists behind the
assessment say that there is still time to act.]{.underline} Certain
leaders, including U.S. President Joe [Biden]{.underline}, have [vowed
to limit warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to meet that
goal]{.underline}, but few nations have offered specific plans. [To
limit warming to that threshold, humans need to cut global greenhouse
gas emissions nearly in half by 2030 and come close to eliminating their
fossil-fuel emissions by 2050.]{.underline}

["Now is the time to turn rage into action," Guterres says in a
statement. "Every fraction of a degree matters. Every voice can make a
difference. And every second counts."]{.underline}

[THE TRIFECTA of the **worst pandemic** in a century, the **worst

of **American power** and an]{.underline} [accelerated]{.underline} fin
de siècle [breakdown of the **post-Cold War order**]{.underline}. This
[predicament has given rise to a panoply of essays and
reports]{.underline}, a series of them in the July/August issue of
Foreign Affairs alone, debating "[The World After the Pandemic," with
variations on how the United States must, **phoenix-like**, **shape** a
**new order**.]{.underline} One recent example that is emblematic of the
Washington foreign policy mainstream emanates from the Council on
Foreign Relations. It is entitled The End of World Order and American
Foreign Policy, by Robert Blackwill and Thomas Wright.

[While it articulately sketches the damage wrought by COVID-19, a
collapsed economy, and the challenges ahead,]{.underline} like many of
its predecessors, it [rests on some **dubious
assumptions**]{.underline}. It also appears to [substantially discount
both the role of the United States as a causal factor]{.underline}---not
least, the [cost of Donald Trump's systematic efforts to undo the
**multilateral system**]{.underline}---and the degree of difficulty of
repairing a broken U.S. political system that is an impediment to
restoring U.S. stature. Similarly [underestimated]{.underline} are the
[costs to the **moral authority** and **legitimacy** of **U.S.
leadership** resulting from U.S. political tribalism and behavior in the
world this centu]{.underline}ry, qualitatively worsened by the wrecking
ball of the current president. Moreover, their recommendations often
consist of well-trodden bromides that fail to acknowledge the difficult
reforms required to achieve them.

Chief among the [flawed assumptions is their belief that perpetual U.S.
primacy is both desirable and possible, the "indispensable
natio]{.underline}n"---a cliché well past its sell-by date that
ex-diplomat Nicholas Burns repeated in a recent Harvard Magazine essay.
This is a core assumption to most grand strategy plans. They [grossly
underestimate the degree to which **U.S. stature has diminished**, while
at the same time **overestimating U.S. leverage**]{.underline} and,
crucially, domestic support for it. It is a testament to American
leadership in the post-World War II period that so many countries were
able to rise, with China chief among them. This [redistribution of power
is one of the dilemmas of the success of the post-World War II system
the United States engineered.]{.underline} There is [no denying the
shift in wealth and power from West to East, of which U.S.-driven
globalization]{.underline} was one of the principal motors. But with
developing states comprising a half or more of global gdp---and a large
and growing portion of their trade and investment with China and each
other---[can we really expect that they would fall in line with the
United States continuing to run the world forever]{.underline}? After
all, [**Chinese**, **Russian**, **Indian**, **Iranian**, and other
civilizations predate the United States by **several
millennia**]{.underline}. [Samuel Huntington]{.underline} may have been
wrong on many counts, particularly in asserting the inevitability of the
clash of civilizations, but was [right in noting that other nations are
apt to think they are superior and wouldn't want to defer to America
forever]{.underline}.

Moreover, the [United States hasn't helped itself]{.underline} in the
past two decades [by mismanaging the global system, championing **regime
change** and **democracy promotion** programs]{.underline} that have
[resulted in **failure**]{.underline}, and [seeding more
instability]{.underline} than countering it. The ever-lengthening
conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan should have been a wake-up call. But
no---the United States and its allies destabilized Libya under the
rubric of "humanitarian intervention" and then walked away.

THE PROBLEM with [failure]{.underline} is that it [seeds the ambitions
of others]{.underline}. Simultaneous with the foreign policy failures,
the [United States]{.underline} all-but [brought the global system down
in the **2008 financial crisis**]{.underline}. At that point, [China
began to be convinced that the United States was in decline. U.S.
incompetence in response to the **COVID**-19 pandemic has reinforced
**perceptions of decline**.]{.underline} While we like to forget, if not
forgive ourselves, for our blunders, others are not as charitable.
Credibility is a terrible thing to lose.

Domestically, the [American public finds the costs of U.S. hegemony
**too high** and the **benefits too small.**]{.underline} That is one of
the lessons of the Trump phenomenon. Written before the eruption of
protests inside America, the Blackwill and Wright strategy fails to
fathom the magnitude of the problems at home. It understates the depth
of U[.S. dysfunction this century, its **broken political
system**]{.underline} and [the public's sense of
**distrust**---including of modern medical science---and the difficulty
in fixing]{.underline} it. No hegemonic power can effectively run the
world while ignoring long-festering domestic schisms and calls for
reform. The post-Second World War G.I. bill---which rebuilt the middle
class with its low-cost mortgages, low-interest loans to start a
business or farm, and tuition payments---was a prerequisite to Truman's
success in convincing the American public to reengage in a global fight
against Communism. Finding a scapegoat in China for America's problems
at home and even tariffs against Chinese imports are not a long-term
solution for the U.S. middle class.

[Only]{.underline} by dealing [directly with the problems of the middle
class---slipping educational achievement]{.underline} by its sons and
daughters and the lack of well-paying jobs---will we [have a chance to
rebuild our credibility and standing.]{.underline} The challenge is
defining a new social contract. Any proposed strategy must suggest a way
out of this predicament, not simply say it should happen, as Blackwill
and Wright assert. This sort of facile assertion is similarly an
attribute of other prescriptive treatises of this genre.

The [good news is that we have an opportunity. COVID-19 has almost been
as bad as the Great Depression]{.underline} in turning 20 percent or
more out of work[.]{.underline} Populism, resulting in Trump's 2016
election, was built on the anger and resentment of former workers in the
manufacturing sector seeing their jobs disappear. Even if COVID-19
doesn't make many salaried workers redundant, automation and AI may soon
eliminate or disrupt the job market for much of the workforce. This is a
problem facing workers from the factory floor to the professions
everywhere. [If the United States could be a leader in **reforming** its
**social protections**, upping educational achievements]{.underline},
and instituting lifelong training opportunities, then maybe it could be
a model for helping other countries to adapt to the modern super-charged
technological age.

Then there is the issue of diversity. [Anti-immigration sentiment and
racism are on the upsurge]{.underline}. America used to welcome
immigrants, providing the country with a huge demographic and economic
advantage. We made great strides in the 1960s on civil rights and
allowing non-whites to find a home in America. The United States does
have an opportunity to show the world how to tackle this major issue
tearing at the social fabric in most advanced economies. [It is a
mistake to underestimate U.S. resilience]{.underline}. The protracted
[national protests]{.underline} this summer, sparked by the police
killing of George Floyd, and polls indicating substantial shifts in
views on racial injustice, may be a [glimmer of such resilience
ahead]{.underline}. But [it's way overdue to think about the domestic
and foreign policies as two sides of the same coin.]{.underline} The
more we can turn ourselves back into a model for others, showing how
deep-seated problems can be tackled, the better able we will be to
re-attract followers.

Unfortunately, [COVID-19 has had the **opposite effect**]{.underline}.
The U.[S. response]{.underline}, viewed as pitiable incompetence, also
looks miserly towards others in the developing world, [granting China
fertile ground to expand its influence]{.underline}. The [Trump
administration has made it clear that Americans come first in
line]{.underline} for any vaccine---even if the United States must
commandeer suppliers from foreign producers. If [**China** leapfrogs
ahead in this zero-sum competition for vaccine development, where would
that leave the United States?]{.underline}

### Heg Sustainable

#### US heg is [sustainable]{.underline} -- multiple reasons: 

#### Democracies can self-correct and relative economic strength

Will Still Dominate the World After Coronavirus", 6/19/2020,

The conspicuous [absence of American leadership during the pandemic has
emboldened the narratives about the **United States' decline** and the
weakening of the **international order**]{.underline}. The result has
been a proliferation of commentary on the reconfiguration of global
power, and America's diminished position.

The [predictions]{.underline} range [from the crisis reshaping the world
order and ending the **transatlantic** relationship, to **China**
becoming the world's dominant geopolitical player.]{.underline}

Former US diplomat Kurt Campbell, in a Foreign Affairs piece co-authored
with Rush Doshi, wrote that for the US, the [coronavirus pandemic 'could
mark another **Suez moment'**. The explicit reference to the crisis of
1956 that signalled the end of Britain's status as a global
power]{.underline} was noted by media in both the US and the UK.

The common denominator of much of the commentary on the [US's decline is
the undue weight given to the **rhetoric** and the **policies** of
President Donald Trump's administration, at the expense of consideration
of the actual indices of global **power** and
**influence**.]{.underline} Trump's [reluctance to rally the
world]{.underline} [under]{.underline} the auspices of [US
leadership]{.underline} may indeed [damage the perception of America as
the **linchpin** of the free world, yet]{.underline} there's been
[little change to the primary structures of power]{.underline} upon
which its global position rests. While [America's
pre-eminence]{.underline} will likely [withstand the current
crisis]{.underline}, the [negative **repercussions** for **China** may
endure.]{.underline}

In the contest for supremacy in what is increasingly being characterised
as a new cold war, [China now faces a world in which its prospects for
expanding its **economic influence** have been severely]{.underline}
[circumscribed]{.underline}. As a result of Beijing's mishandling of the
coronavirus outbreak and its penchant for weaponising its economic
clout, an almost [unanimous consensus has emerged across the developed
world on the need to **reduce dependency** on China.]{.underline}

As former US State Department official Aaron Friedberg observed,
'\[T\]he [experience of finding]{.underline} [themselves dependent in a
dire emergency on an **irresponsible**, **opportunistic**, and
potentially **hostile power**]{.underline} has clearly left an
[impression on **democratic publics** and politicians that will not soon
fade.']{.underline}

The **[political backlash]{.underline}**, coupled with the impetus for
domestic industries to diversify in order to manage supply-chain risks,
will [inhibit the capacity of states to deepen their ties with
China.]{.underline} Given the pre-existing economic and technological
disparity between the US and China, it's far from certain how China will
narrow the gap in a global climate if all the advanced industrial
economies strive to moderate their ties with Beijing.

There's been a [tendency among observers to suggest]{.underline} that,
since [both **Beijing** and **Washington** have mismanaged the crisis,
the global power and influence of both will diminish]{.underline}. Such
parallels, however, erroneously assume an equivalence in the
adaptability of democratic and authoritarian regimes. There's a
[**resiliency in democracies** that's not shared by autocratic forms of
government]{.underline}. As the American public intellectual Walter
Lippmann put it, '[Democracies always have **several governments** in
reserve, whereas autocracies only have one.]{.underline}' The [capacity
of democracies to withstand crises is greater than that of autocracies.
When a democracy faces a crisis, the entire system of government is not
on the line, but rather the transient governing administration. In an
autocracy there's no such clear separation.]{.underline}

The [Chinese Communist Party's lack of transparency, its intransigence
on dissent and its propensity to **conceal failures**]{.underline} and
[**transgressions**]{.underline} are the imperatives of a [ruling party
concerned with regime preservation and maintaining order.]{.underline}
The [defects of the CCP are enshrined in the state. If]{.underline} the
[party were to initiate reforms in favour of **openness** and
**transparency**]{.underline} to re-establish its international
credibility, it [would risk the **survival of CCP rule**]{.underline}.
And we know that the example of Gorbachev's perestroika and glasnost in
Russia hasn't been lost on the Chinese leadership.

The [Trump administration's failures]{.underline} and missteps, on the
other hand, [end with the administration]{.underline}. The [US possesses
**geopolitical, economic, technological and military
advantages**]{.underline} that are too [**well entrenched**]{.underline}
to be jeopardised by any occupant of the White House. Being the only
major nation without great-power threats in its own hemisphere gives the
US capabilities in force projection that no other power shares.

Economically, [America's per capita GDP is unsurpassed among the great
powers]{.underline}, yet it's also the [only]{.underline} [power that
doesn't face a **demographic problem**]{.underline}. The strength of its
[economy enables the US to outspend all other powers combined on
**defence**,]{.underline} using no more than 4% of its GDP. That's much
less than the 15% to 7% spent from the 1950s to the late 1980s. It's
cheaper for the US to maintain military supremacy today than it was
throughout the Cold War.

Despite [Trump's 'America first' approach, the **global position** of
the US and its institutions remains **intact**.]{.underline} Throughout
the Covid-19 crisis, it [hasn't been the People's Bank of
China]{.underline} that the central banks of the world have turned to
for assistance, [but rather the **US Federal Reserve**]{.underline},
which through swap lines and repo arrangements has again demonstrated
how central America is to global stability. Today, [the US is still the
**singular power** with the wherewithal and force projection to defend
its interests]{.underline} globally. Until that changes, [America's
'**Suez moment'** will still be a long **way away**.]{.underline}

The [**economic**, **political** and **security strategy** that the
United States has pursued for more than seven decades]{.underline},
under Democratic and Republican administrations alike, is [today widely
questioned by large segments of the American public and is under attack
by leading political candidates in both parties]{.underline}. Many
[Americans no longer seem to value the **liberal international order**
that the United States created after World War II and sustained
throughout the Cold War and beyond]{.underline}. Or perhaps they take it
for granted and have [lost sight of the essential role the United States
plays in supporting the international environment]{.underline} from
which they benefit greatly. The [unprecedented **prosperity** made
possible by free and **open markets** and thriving **international
trade**]{.underline}; the **[spread of democracy]{.underline}**; and the
[avoidance of major conflict among great powers]{.underline}: All these
[remarkable accomplishments have depended on sustained U**.S.
engagement** around the world]{.underline}. Yet politicians in both
parties dangle before the public the vision of an America freed from the
burdens of leadership.

What these politicians don't say, perhaps because they don't understand
it themselves, is that the [price of ending our engagement would far
outweigh its costs]{.underline}. The [**international order** created by
the United States today faces challenges greater than at any time
since]{.underline} the height of the [Cold War]{.underline}. Rising
[authoritarian powers in Asia and Europe threaten]{.underline} to
undermine the security structures that have kept the peace since World
War II. [Russia **invaded Ukraine** and has seized some of its
territory]{.underline}. In East Asia, an [increasingly aggressive China
seeks to control the sea lanes through which a large share of global
commerce flows.]{.underline} In the Middle East, Iran pursues hegemony
by supporting Hezbollah and Hamas and the bloody tyranny in Syria. [The
**Islamic State** controls more territory than any terrorist group in
history]{.underline}, brutally imposing its extreme vision of Islam and
striking at targets throughout the Middle East, North Africa and Europe.
[None of these threats will simply go away]{.underline}. [Nor will the
United States be spared if the international order
collapses]{.underline}, as it did twice in the 20th century. In the 21st
century, oceans provide no security. Nor do walls along borders. [Nor
would cutting off the United States from the international economy by
trashing trade agreements and erecting barriers to
commerce.]{.underline}

Instead of following the irresponsible counsel of demagogues, we need to
restore a bipartisan foreign policy consensus around renewing U.S.
global leadership. Despite predictions of a "post-American world," [U.S.
capacities remain considerable. The U.S. economy remains the **most
dynamic** in the world.]{.underline} The widely touted "rise of the
rest"---the [idea that the United States was being overtaken by
the]{.underline} [**economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China---has
proved to be a** myth. The dollar remains the world's reserve currency,
and people across the globe seek **U.S. investment** and
**entrepreneurial skills** to help their flagging
economies]{.underline}. U.S. institutions of higher learning remain the
world's best and attract students from every corner of the globe. The
political values that the United States stands for remain potent forces
for change. Even at a time of resurgent autocracy, popular demands for
greater freedom can be heard in Russia, China, Iran and elsewhere, and
those peoples look to the United States for support, both moral and
material. [And our strategic position remains strong]{.underline}. The
[United States has more than 50 allies and partners around the world.
Russia and China between them have no more than a handful.]{.underline}

[The task ahead is to play on these **strengths** and provide the kind
of leadership that many around the world seek and that the American
public can support]{.underline}. For the past two years, under the
auspices of the World Economic Forum, we have worked with a diverse,
bipartisan group of Americans and representatives from other countries
to put together the broad outlines of a strategy for renewed U.S.
leadership. There is nothing magical about our proposals. [The
strategies to sustain the present international order are much the same
as the strategies that created it. But they need to be adapted and
updated to meet new challenges and take advantage of new
opportunities]{.underline}.

For instance, one [prime task today is to strengthen the international
economy, from which the American people derive so many
**benefits**]{.underline}. This means passing trade agreements that
strengthen ties between the United States and the vast economies of East
Asia and Europe. Contrary to what demagogues in both parties claim,
ordinary Americans stand to gain significantly from the recently
negotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership. According to the Peterson
Institute for International Economics, the agreement will increase
annual real incomes in the United States by \$131 billion. [The United
States also needs to work to reform existing international institutions,
such as the **International Monetary Fund**, so that rising economic
powers such as China feel a greater stake in them]{.underline}, while
also working with new institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank to ensure that they reinforce rather than undermine
liberal economic norms.

The [**revolution in energy**, which has made the United States one of
the world's leading suppliers, offers another powerful
advantage.]{.underline} With the right mix of policies, the United
States could help allies in Europe and Asia diversify their sources of
supply and thus reduce their vulnerability to Russian manipulation.
Nations such as Russia and Iran that rely heavily on hydrocarbon exports
would be weakened, as would the OPEC oil cartel. The overall result
would be a relative increase in our power and ability to sustain the
order.

[The world has come to recognize that **education**, **creativity** and
**innovation** are **key to prosperity**, and most see the United States
as a leader in these are]{.underline}as. Other nations want access to
the American market, American finance and American innovation.
Businesspeople around the world seek to build up their own Silicon
Valleys and other U.S.-style centers of entrepreneurship. [The U.S.
government can do a better job of working with the private sector in
collaborating with **developing countries**]{.underline}. And Americans
need to be more, not less, **[welcoming to immigrants]{.underline}**.
Students studying at our world-class universities, entrepreneurs
innovating in our high-tech incubators and immigrants searching for new
opportunities for their families strengthen the United States and show
the world the opportunities offered by democracy.

Finally, the United States [needs to do more to reassure allies that it
will be there to back them up if they face aggression]{.underline}.
Would-be [adversaries need to know that they would do better by
integrating themselves into the present **international
order**]{.underline} than by trying to undermine it. Accomplishing this,
however, requires ending budget sequestration and increasing spending on
defense and on all the other tools of international affairs. [This
investment would be more than paid for by the global security it would
provide.]{.underline}

The third is [Taiwan's determination to defend itself. Taiwan at this
stage is focusing its efforts on self-reliance without provoking
China]{.underline}. The current Tsi Ing-wen government does not chant
slogans about independence to ease concerns on the other side of the
Taiwan Strait. On the other hand, the [Taiwanese government is keen to
acquire weapon systems that are essential for defense. Taiwan has
continued to increase its defense spending in recent years, especially
for defensive systems. The United States is also actively supporting
Taiwan in this respect. Thanks to the current military build-up, Taiwan
could survive a sudden Chinese attack which makes Beijing hesitant to
launch a preemptive but costly military action.]{.underline}

What are the unexpected factors in China's calculations to use force in
the future? Two important factors relate to President Xi. Among the
leaders of the Chinese Communist Party[, Xi might think that unification
is something only he can achieve]{.underline}. Neither Mao Zedong, who
founded a new country nor Deng Xiaoping, a reform pioneer, could do it.
[If Xi succeeds in unifying Taiwan with the mainland, he will outrank
Mao Zedong. His private ambitions are unlikely to be easily observed
publicly, though.]{.underline}

Conversely, if [Xi Jinping is weakened, the possibility of an armed
attack on Taiwan may increase]{.underline}. In other words, it is a [way
for Xi to divert the public's attention to alleviate other internal
problems]{.underline}. Therefore, if support for Xi Jinping's regime
weakens, a [move to take Taiwan by force could be an option to alleviate
the domestic pressure on President Xi]{.underline}.

The Trump administration's National Defense Strategy (NDS) was
substantially predicated on preventing two faits accomplis: a Russian
invasion of the Baltics and a Chinese amphibious assault on Taiwan. To
what degree these scenarios will survive the Biden administration's
soon-to- be-released strategic review remains to be seen. The most
likely outcome is that "integrated deterrence," Secretary of Defense
Lloyd Austin's term---for now more a slogan than a strategic concept
that attempts a more "wholistic" all-of-government effort---will become
prominent, as will a greater focus on the "deter" element rather than on
"defeat" as was the last NDS. Defining what defeat means and how it
would be achieved remains elusive. Some observers believe that how the
United States handles the Ukraine crisis will be closely watched by
China. That is true. But, as this paper argues, the [Ukraine crisis will
not influence Chinese decisions on whether or not to launch a full-scale
amphibious invasion because, given the force demands,]{.underline}
[China simply lacks the capacity to do so for the foreseeable
future.]{.underline} The
[current](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/23/taiwan-china-threat-admiral-john-aquilino)
and
[former](https://news.usni.org/2021/03/09/davidson-china-could-try-to-take-control-of-taiwan-in-next-six-years)
heads of Indo-Pacific Command have warned about China's building the
necessary forces to invade and conquer Taiwan, possibly by decade's end.
Given China's long-standing determination to make Taiwan part of the
mainland and achieve "[one China," a military takeover of Taiwan sounds
plausible.]{.underline} However, this notion is based on [a fundamental
misperception regarding China's capability to launch a major amphibious
assault.]{.underline} If China were to launch such a military attack on
Taiwan, what would that take in terms of forces and force levels? Does
China possess the requisite numbers and capabilities? If not, when, if
at all, might it build those forces that, if history counts, would
number in the hundreds of thousands of troops and thousands of ships and
maritime assault vehicles? Current and past studies do not successfully
or specifically address these questions. These studies focus on the how,
but not on the specific manpower requirements of what would be required
to carry out an invasion. The definitive document on what size force
would be required to seize Taiwan in a full-out landing was drafted by
the US military in the late stages of World War II in the Pacific. In
1944, [Operation
Causeway](https://grahamthomasauthor.wordpress.com/2020/06/20/operation-causeway/)
was the US plan for retaking Formosa, as it was then called, from 30,000
starving Japanese soldiers. The planned invasion force was double the
size of Operation Overlord, the Normandy landing: 400,000 soldiers and
marines deployed on 4,000 ships. With a potential defending force of
450,000 Taiwanese today[, using the traditional three-to-one ratio of
attackers to defenders taught at war colleges, China would need to
deploy over 1.2 million soldiers]{.underline} (out of a total active
force of over 2 million). [Many thousands of ships would be required to
land all those forces, and doing so would take weeks.]{.underline} How
many occupation forces would be required to pacify the Taiwanese? Surely
the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq are not lost on the PLA leadership.
[China possesses a small fraction of the necessary ships to execute a
landing of that size and lacks the capacity to do so for the foreseeable
future]{.underline}. Nor are there any current plans suggesting China is
intent on procuring such a force, though that could change.

#### Xi's re-election

Strategy, Seoul, worked for Korea Institute for Defense Analyses,

<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-china-cant-afford-attack-taiwan-203504>,
accessed 7/23/22, DC\]

I believe that a [Chinese attack on Taiwan would be
difficult]{.underline} at this time. First, consider the difficulty of
starting a war amid political uncertainty. [At the]{.underline} Chinese
Communist Party's ([CCP) upcoming National Congress in the fall,
President Xi Jinping must be approved for his third term]{.underline} by
2,287 CCP delegates from all over China. Although the vote of approval
is merely a symbolic process, **[Xi would not want his remarkable
achievements to be overshadowed by hostile acts before the
fall.]{.underline}** [Therefore, the use of military force against
Taiwan]{.underline} would [not]{.underline} be an [optimal]{.underline}
choice.

### Turns Case -- Taiwan War impacts causes misapplication of resources

**Misinterpreting China's intention towards Taiwan causes misapplication
of US resources**

**Ullman 22,** Senior Advisor of the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC,
A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, he served in combat in assignments
in Vietnam. (Harlan, 2/18,2022, "Reality Check #10: China will not

Accessed 7/23/2022, CC

Nevertheless, [given China's]{.underline} size, strength, autocratic
government, ambitions, and [commitment to "one China," the United States
cannot totally rule out the possibility of an amphibious assault.
Focusing US resources primarily on such a scenario would be a grave
mistake,]{.underline} however. If the danger of Chinese aggression
against, and indeed an invasion of, Taiwan is considered among the
likely or plausible scenarios, the response must be to plan to defeat
that outcome. [Any military conflict with the United States beyond a
Taiwan scenario would be a home game for China and an away game for the
United States and those who might be persuaded to join the
fight.]{.underline} [Substantial resources would be needed to compensate
for the disadvantages of geography and external lines of
communications.]{.underline} Taiwan is only 100 miles off the Chinese
coast. With China's DF-21 and other missiles with ranges of 1,500-2,000
miles, a reinforcing naval force would come under fire for at least two
or more day's steaming before reaching the combat area. They would also
have to avoid submarine and other maritime threats. The same problem
applies to aviation units that would enter China's air defense zones. To
complicate this matter of reinforcement and coming to Taiwan's defense,
[some polls show that Americans are more worried about a Chinese
invasion than are the Taiwanese.]{.underline} Defending a friend is more
difficult when that friend is less preoccupied or concerned with the
threat than US citizens are. [The United States cannot be successful in
defending Taiwan if it regards the Chinese threat as more dangerous than
the country it intends to protect. Finally, **fixating on an unlikely
scenario**, no matter how compelling it sounds, **skews US resources and
force levels**]{.underline}. An expeditionary force designed to protect
Taiwan may not fit more relevant roles such as supporting formal treaty
allies, responding to other contingencies, and influencing China by
force dispositions---especially if there is no appetite to invade in the
first place. It was no accident that Napoleon and Hitler failed to cross
the 25-mile wide English Channel! The United States must consider and
plan for many contingencies with respect to Taiwan**. [China has options
other than a full-scale amphibious invasion.]{.underline}** [It could
seize small islands belonging to Taiwan, such as Kinmen and Matsu, to
exert leverage. It could impose economic and financial embargoes. It
could impose a physical blockade with its maritime militia physically
denying access to the island.]{.underline} It could attempt a regime
change from within, using the equivalent of Russia's "Little Green Men"
who seized the Crimean Parliament in 2014. [China could infiltrate the
political parties and Taiwanese government and use influence operations
to change public support. It could contrive or provoke a crisis to force
Taiwan to accept a settlement that could lead to annexation. It could
obliterate Taiwan under a rain of missiles. However, unless Taiwan were
to declare independence**, it is very unlikely that**---barring a
crisis---**China would attempt any direct annexation**.]{.underline}
[Moreover, an amphibious assault is not now a serious or feasible
option.]{.underline} [Misunderstanding an adversary in developing a
strategy leads to failure, or worse.]{.underline} [Hitler thought Russia
would fold in 1941. The Japanese thought Pearl Harbor would force an
American capitulation. Gen.]{.underline} Douglas MacArthur did not
believe the Chinese would intervene in Korea as his forces raced toward
the Yalu River in late 1950. Washington believed it could bomb North
Vietnam into submission, that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and
that Iraqis could easily takeover governing their country after Saddam
Hussein had been overthrown. The Pentagon's civilian leaders have
declared China to be "the pacing challenge for the US military." Many
Americans are fearful that a rising China's increasing diplomatic
assertiveness, military buildup, militarizing small islets in the China
Seas, and pursuit of the ambitious Belt-and-Road Initiative is a danger
not only to the United States, but to much of the world. However, the
nature of the specific threats is not clear. A possible Taiwan invasion
must be plausible and based on why and how China could or would embark
on that course of action. Thus far, no US administration has explained
how such an invasion would be carried out.

[Taiwan's domestic issues must also be considered. Taiwan is a young
democratic country that is vulnerable to demagoguery by politicians
trying to win elections]{.underline}. Generally speaking, in a
democratic country, [extremist lines can easily win support from the
public during economic downturns]{.underline}. Much as Adolf Hitler came
to power when the German people were struggling with unbearable
reparations after World War I, it is possible that a [Taiwanese
political leader could promote independence as a solution to Taiwan's
worsening economic situation. In this situation, China will have no
choice but to respond militarily.]{.underline} As with any society,
[Taiwan faces many internal problems]{.underline}. First, [low wages and
high housing costs are affecting the marriage rate and leading to
decreases in fertility]{.underline}. It is true [that Taiwan's economy
is currently healthy despite the stress of the Covid-19 pandemic.
However, if the economic situation worsens and unemployment and
inflation rise]{.underline}, the domestic problems mentioned above may
be the straw that broke the camel's back. In November, Taiwan will have
local council elections and two years later, there will be a
presidential election. What if politicians running for election take an
extreme position on independence to boost their popularity? It is likely
that the Taiwanese will respond to the political slogan of politicians,
and desire independence from China as a blueprint for a hopeful future.
