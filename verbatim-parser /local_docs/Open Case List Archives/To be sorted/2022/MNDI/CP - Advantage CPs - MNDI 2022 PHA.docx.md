Lead in Research & Development [Greater investments in artificial
intelligence research and development are essential to maintaining
American leadership in AI]{.underline}. Throughout the 20th century, the
federal government played a critical role in fueling technological
innovation by funding pivotal basic research. Government funding was
essential to developing the transistor, GPS, and the
internet---inventions that transformed the world economy. Yet over the
past several decades, federal government spending on R&D as a percentage
of GDP declined from about 1.2% in 1976 to around 0.7% in 2018.1 This is
a worrisome trend as the federal government remains the main funder of
basic research. [Government support again could be pivotal both in
fostering new AI breakthroughs and ensuring that the U.S. government has
access to those breakthroughs]{.underline}. Beyond AI, overall R&D
spending trends are troubling. Other countries are outpacing the United
States with faster growth of their national R&D budgets. Total U.S.
national (public and private) R&D expenditures as a share of GDP have
been mostly stagnant since 1996. China quadrupled its R&D expenses as a
share of GDP over the same time frame, and countries like Israel and
Cementing American Artificial Intelligence Leadership: AI Research &
Development AUGUST 2020 2 South Korea also significantly ramped up
spending.2 As a result, the U.S. share of global R&D has declined over
the past several decades, falling from 69% in 1960 to 28% in 2016. From
2000 to 2015, the United States accounted for 19% of global R&D growth,
while China accounted for 31%.3 China was on track to top the United
States in total R&D investments (in purchasing power parityadjusted
dollars) as soon as 2019.4 R&D is a key driver of long-term economic
growth. According to a report from BPC's American Energy Innovation
Council titled Energy Innovation Fueling America's Economic Engine:5
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION CAN IMPROVE PRODUCTIVIT Y ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND
CRE ATE ENTIRELY NEW ONES. THIS IS ONE AMONG MANY RE ASONS WHY
ECONOMISTS AGREE THAT INNOVATION IS A DRIVER OF LONG -TERM ECONOMIC GROW
TH AND STABILIT Y---AND WHY AT LE AST 50 PERCENT OF U.S. ANNUAL GDP GROW
TH CAN BE TRACED TO INCREASES IN INNOVATION. The Bipartisan Policy
Center (BPC) and the Center for New American Security (CNAS), in
consultation with Reps. Will Hurd (R-TX) and Robin Kelly (D-IL), have
worked with government officials, industry representatives, civil
society advocates, and academics to better understand the country's
major AI related R&D needs. This paper hopes to shed more clarity on
these challenges and provide actionable policy recommendations, to help
guide a U.S. national strategy for AI. BPC's effort is primarily
designed to complement the work done by the Obama and Trump
administrations, including President Barack Obama's 2016 National
Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan6 and
President Donald Trump's 2019 update, Trump's Executive Order 13859,
announcing the American AI Initiative, 7 and the Office of Management
and Budget's subsequent Guidance for Regulation of Artificial
Intelligence Applications. 8 The effort is also designed to further
advance work done by Kelly and Hurd in their 2018 Oversight and
Government Reform Committee (Information Technology Subcommittee) white
paper Rise of the Machines: Artificial Intelligence and its Growing
Impact on U.S. Policy9 and the CNAS report The American AI Century: A
Blueprint for Action. Our goal through this effort is to provide the
legislative branch with actions it can take to advance AI building on
the work being done by the Obama and Trump administrations. 3 II. Key
Principles 1. [Overall federal AI R&D spending needs to increase
significantly]{.underline} 2. The country needs to expand and diversify
its computing capacity 3. The federal government plays a key role in
incentivizing private sector R&D 4. There needs to be international
cooperation to advance AI research and development 5. The federal
government would benefit from opening up avenues for private talent 6.
AI standards and measurement are essential to fostering AI technologies
that are safe, secure, reliable, and comport with U.S. norms and values
4 III. Overview The private sector, academia, and the government have a
long history of collaborating to advance technological innovation.
Academia, often through support of federally funded grants, historically
has conducted much of the basic research that has enabled the private
sector to advance applied research and commercialize technologies. This
partnership, however, is being strained by recent innovations in machine
learning whose advancement relies on large datasets and compute
resources that are increasingly unavailable to academic researchers. To
ensure the United States is maximizing its R&D potential and to ensure
the entire R&D cycle from basic research to commercialization is fully
utilized, the partnership of government, academia, and the private
sector must be strengthened to ensure each has adequate access to the
resources they need while protecting intellectual property rights and
data privacy. This includes standardizing and making current and future
government datasets more readily available to the private sector and
academia to facilitate training of machine learning models.10 Under the
OPEN Government Data Act of 2019, federal agencies are required by
statute to make available government datasets in standardized,
machine-readable formats.11 Doing so will help to address data scarcity
problems, especially for entities with significant resource constraints
such as startups or some university researchers, by expanding the number
of open-source high-quality datasets and increasing access to compute
resources.12 5 IV. Key Takeaways Overall AI R&D spending needs to
increase significantly The U.S. government remains the largest funder of
basic research in the United States. As during the 1960s and 1970s,
government support again could be pivotal today both in fostering new
breakthroughs and ensuring that the U.S. government has access to them.
[The federal government should prioritize high-risk/high-reward basic
science research---areas where private industry has little incentive to
invest but that holds tremendous potential for valuable new knowledge.
Breakthroughs in software, such as novel AI techniques that address the
limitation of existing AI methods, and hardware, such as nextgeneration
semiconductor technologies and superconducting artificial neurons, could
be game changers that provide the United States with a continuing
technological edge]{.underline}. [Advances in AI can also further R&D of
other fields because of its broad, interdisciplinary
nature]{.underline}, while breakthroughs in areas like neuroscience can
greatly advance AI development. Unclassified federal government spending
on defense AI R&D in fiscal year 2020 will be about \$4 billion,
according to a Bloomberg analysis from March 2019.13 In September 2019,
the White House announced an FY2020 nondefense AI R&D budget request of
nearly \$1 billion.14 In contrast, the level of Chinese government
spending on AI R&D is not clear. Complete annualized figures for Chinese
government spending are not publicly available. Instead, only
announcements of planned, multi-year spending offer a window into the
scale of overall government R&D spending at the national, provincial,
and local levels.15 For instance, two Chinese cities alone announced the
creation of RMB 100 billion (approximately \$15 billion) multi-year AI
development funds while Beijing unveiled plans for a \$2 billion AI
research park in 2018.16 The United States enjoys robust private sector
R&D funding. Precise figures are hard to discern because companies
typically do not divulge details for R&D expenditures in their financial
statements and privately-owned firms do not have such reporting
requirements. That said, looking at overall R&D expenditures by major
AI-intensive companies gives a sense of the scale of private investments
in AI R&D. The combined 2018 R&D expenditures by U.S. firms Alphabet,
IBM, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon was \$80.5 billion.17 China's tech
giants also report significant R&D investments, although they are
considerably smaller than those of their U.S. counterparts. Leading
Chinese AI firms Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent collectively spent \$9.1
billion on R&D in 2018.18 These firms are also major investors in
Chinese AI startups.19 6 In April 2020, the National Security Commission
on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) published its first quarter
recommendations, calling for an immediate doubling of non-DOD AI R&D
funding to \$2 billion. NSCAI emphasized the importance of funding basic
research and investing in new microelectronics technologies. This echoes
the White House AI R&D budget request for FY2021-22.20 Recommendation
#1: Congress and the White House should adopt the NSCAI and White House
recommendations to double AI R&D spending immediately, and further
commit to boosting total yearly federal AI R&D spending to \$25 billion
by FY2025. Spending at this level is realistic and doable: \$25 billion
is equal to about 19% of total federal R&D spending in the FY2020
budget. Congress should concurrently raise total federal R&D spending to
1.2% of GDP to achieve an overall boost of total public and private R&D
spending to 4% of GDP. Recommendation #2: [Congress should ensure R&D
includes funding to address shortcomings of current AI methods with
novel fundamental approaches: prevalent deep learning systems in use
today typically require large amounts of training data and computing
resources that are often not available to academics and startups.
Research of novel AI techniques requiring smaller data sets to train and
that make more efficient use of compute could lead to important
breakthroughs in the field]{.underline}. While increased investments in
AI R&D are urgently necessary, this should not come at the expense of
research in other disciplines. Am[erican competitiveness in the 21st
century will depend on strong capabilities in a broad range of
capabilities. Importantly, R&D investments in other sectors can enable
better AI systems, creating a virtuous cycle of scientific
advancement.]{.underline}

although one motivation of autonomous systems is the increased safety of

In a historic global agreement on 25 November 2021, [all 193 members of
the United Nations Educational, Science and Cultural Organisation
adopted the "Recommendation on the ethics of artificial
intelligence".]{.underline} However, the recommendations are not a
binding agreement, rather guidelines that nations can follow

Moreover, [UNESCO recognises the potential that AI possesses in terms of
benefitting ecosystems and the environment.]{.underline}

[On the other hand, UNESCO, in its document, highlights the dangers of
AI. It raises ethical concerns surrounding the gender and ethnic biases
that are "embedded" in algorithms which may "exacerbate" inequality,
exclusion and threats to cultural, social and ecological diversity. The
document further raises AI red flags by stating that AI technology may
deepen a divide between countries.]{.underline}

Ethics of AI: Values and Principles

[The document defines the scope and provides a universal framework of
values and principles of the ethics of AI within its scope. The
definition of AI within the document includes and is not limited to
machine learning, machine reasoning, cyber-physical systems, IoT, and
all stages of AI systems life cycle (process, person,
enterprise).]{.underline}

The objective of the document is to guide the actions of the
stakeholders in embedding the ethics of the AI, promote human rights and
fundamental freedom in all stages of the AI life cycle, and promote
equitable access to development and knowledge in the field of AI between
the global north and south nations. [The recommendations explicitly ban
the use of AI social scoring and mass surveillance and advocate stronger
data protection.]{.underline}

[The text principally calls for:]{.underline}

[Fairness and Non-Discrimination- Fairness implies sharing the benefits
of AI technologies at local, national and international levels while
considering the specific needs of different marginalised and vulnerable
populations.]{.underline}

[Sustainability- AI technologies must be continually assessed for their
social, cultural, economic and environmental impact.]{.underline}

[Privacy-- Human autonomy and agency must be respected, and data must be
collected, shared, archived and deleted ethically. The document also
calls for data protection through frameworks and government mechanisms
set up by regulatory bodies.]{.underline} In addition, algorithmic
systems must undergo privacy impact assessment, which includes societal
and ethical considerations.

[Safety and Security-- Unwanted harm and vulnerability to attack should
be avoided by developing privacy-protective data access frameworks that
foster better training AI models.]{.underline}

[Transparency and Explainability- Transparency ensures respect for human
rights principles. Explainability refers to making intelligible and
insightful outcomes to the AI system.]{.underline}

[Responsibility and Accountability- Similar to transparency and
explainability, the principle ensures human rights and
freedom.]{.underline}

[Awareness and Literacy- Public awareness and understanding of AI
technologies and the value of data must be promoted through open and
accessible education to all.]{.underline}

Political Scenario

Interestingly, [nations like China and Russia who have a comprehensive
mass surveillance system, have voted to adopt AI Ethics Recommendations.
The USA, a country that houses the most number of AI companies, is not a
part of UNESCO, thus, not a signatory to the document.]{.underline}

well-aligned with the OECD AI Principles and takes important action to
support the development of trustworthy AI. The Initiative emphasizes the
following key policies and practices: ***Invest in AI research and
development:*** The United States must promote Federal investment in AI
R&D in collaboration with industry, academia, international partners and
allies, and other non-Federal entities to generate technological
breakthroughs in AI. President Trump called for a two-year [doubling of
non-defense AI R&D in his fiscal year 2021 budget
proposal,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-trumps-fy-2021-budget-commits-double-investments-key-industries-future/)
and in 2019 the Administration [updated its AI R&D strategic
plan,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/National-AI-Research-and-Development-Strategic-Plan-2019-Update-June-2019.pdf)
developed the first [progress
report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AI-Research-and-Development-Progress-Report-2016-2019.pdf)
[describing the impact of Federal R&D
investments,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AI-Research-and-Development-Progress-Report-2016-2019.pdf)
and published the first-ever reporting of government-wide non-defense AI
R&D spending. ***Unleash AI resources**:* The United States must enhance
access to high-quality Federal data, models, and computing resources to
increase their value for AI R&D, while maintaining and extending safety,
security, privacy, and confidentiality protections. The American AI
Initiative directs Federal agencies to [identify new
opportunities](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/07/10/2019-14618/identifying-priority-access-or-quality-improvements-for-federal-data-and-models-for-artificial)
to increase access to and use of Federal data and models. In 2019, the
White House Office of Management and Budget established the [Federal
Data Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov/) as a framework for
operational principles and best practices for Federal agencies and how
they use and manage data. ***Remove barriers to AI innovation**:* [The
United States reduces barriers to the safe development, testing,
deployment, and adoption of AI technologies by providing guidance for
the governance of AI consistent with our Nation's values and by driving
the development of appropriate AI technical standards.]{.underline} As
part of the American AI Initiative, The White House proposed the [United
States AI Regulatory
Principles,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Draft-OMB-Memo-on-Regulation-of-AI-1-7-19.pdf)
a first-of-its-kind national AI regulatory policy that advances
innovation underpinned by American values. In addition, the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued the first-ever
[strategy for Federal engagement in the
development](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2019/08/10/ai_standards_fedengagement_plan_9aug2019.pdf)
[of AI technical
standards.](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2019/08/10/ai_standards_fedengagement_plan_9aug2019.pdf)
***Promote an international environment supportive of American AI
innovation**:* [The United States engages internationally to promote a
global environment that supports American AI research and innovation and
opens markets for American AI industries while ensuring that AI is
developed in a matter consistent with our Nation's values,]{.underline}
including protecting privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. Last
year, the United States joined with allies in historic efforts at the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to develop
the first
[intergovernmental](http://www.oecd.org/going-digital/ai/principles/)
[consensus agreement on fundamental principles for the stewardship of
trustworthy AI.](http://www.oecd.org/going-digital/ai/principles/) The
United States supports OECD's ongoing work to implement these principles
through the AI Policy Observatory and related activities. ***Embrace
trustworthy AI for government services and missions**:* The United
States embraces technology such as artificial intelligence to improve
the provision and efficiency of government services to the American
people and ensure its application upholds our Nation's values, including
protecting privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. The General
Services Administration established an [AI Center of
Excellence](https://coe.gsa.gov/coe/artificial-intelligence.html) to
enable Federal agencies to determine best practices for incorporating AI
into their organizations. ***Train an AI-ready workforce**:* The United
States empowers current and future generations of American workers
through apprenticeships; skills programs; and education in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), with an emphasis on
computer science, to ensure that American workers are capable of taking
full advantage of the opportunities of AI. President Trump directed all
Federal agencies to prioritize AI-related apprenticeship and job
training programs and opportunities. In addition to its R&D focus, the
National Science Foundation's new [National AI Research
Institutes](https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=299329&org=NSF&from=news)
program will also contribute to workforce development, particularly of
AI researchers. America's strong innovation ecosystem, fuelled by
strategic Federal investments, visionary scientists and entrepreneurs,
and renowned research institutions, has propelled the United States to
global leadership in AI. However, [continued leadership is not
predetermined. Maintaining America's preeminent role in AI can only be
realized by continually building upon our progress and pursuing a
strategic, forward-looking approach in partnership with industry,
academia, non-profit organizations, other non-Federal entities, and
like-minded international allies]{.underline}. Together, we will shape
the trajectory of AI development for good --- enriching our lives,
promoting innovation, fostering trust and understanding, and ensuring
our national defense and security. NATO slows down solvency and causes
cohesion -- only a unilateral plan avoids **Trabucco and

Further, although one motivation of autonomous systems is the increased
safety of military personnel by removing them from dangerous situations,
the lack of alignment could lead some Allies to perceive other capitals'
deployments of unmanned forces as a lack of commitment to put lives on
the line, therein posing credibility risks for Allies to assure one
another.[^65^](https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780197579329.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780197579329-e-69#oxfordhb-9780197579329-e-69-note-65)

## EU

### AI Act

#### Following onto the EU AI Act 

**Townsend 21** \[Bev Townsend, Postdoctoral Researcher at University of
York, "Decoding the Proposed European Union Artificial Intelligence
Act", Insights,

JMH\]

[[The Proposed]{.mark} Regulation Laying Down [Harmonised Rules on
Artificial Intelligence]{.mark}]{.underline} On April 21, 2021, [[the
European Commission published]{.mark} the highly anticipated proposal
for a Regulation Laying Down Harmonised Rules on Artificial Intelligence
(AI Act or the Act]{.underline}).11 This followed the Commission's
ongoing commitment to establish "legislation for a coordinated European
approach on the human and ethical implications of AI."12 At the outset
it is worth noting that, rather than focusing on the properties or
outcomes of AI, [[the Act defines an "AI system" as software
that]{.mark} is developed using certain techniques and approaches
(detailed in an annex) that [can,]{.mark} for a given set of
human-defined objectives[, generate]{.mark} outputs such as [content,
predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing the environments
they interact with.13]{.mark} Any AI system developed not using one of
the enumerated techniques or approaches falls outside of the
definition---a definition that, because of its imprecision, creates the
opportunity to skilfully circumvent the Act.]{.underline} The intention
is for the new legal framework to provide a set of harmonised rules that
align (and are consistent with) existing EU human rights instruments and
EU law regulating data protection, data governance, consumer protection,
non-discrimination, and gender equality. Accordingly, [a cautious yet
balanced and proportionate regulatory approach is proposed, one that is
primarily risk-based]{.underline}. [It sets out the minimum necessary
requirements to address risks to values, fundamental rights, and
principles associated with AI development and deployment without
unnecessarily constraining technological development or
trade.]{.underline}14 What the Act does---and does well---is to
differentiate requirements by risk level and to prohibit more
objectionable AI systems that carry what is considered "undesirable
risk" of fundamental rights infringement. [[The Act also introduces new
legal obligations]{.mark} (such as monitoring, reporting, and
transparency obligations) [to manage]{.mark} those [systems
that]{.mark}, although not prohibited, [are considered high
risk]{.mark}.]{.underline} Amongst others, the Act establishes a robust
governance, monitoring, and enforcement regime, [sets up a European
Artificial Intelligence Board, and seeks to impose sanctions and
penalties for non-compliance.]{.underline} Adopting a Risk-Based
Approach: The Level of Risk Determines the Applicable Rules. The central
tenet of the AI Act is to introduce a set of binding rules based upon
the intensity and scope of the risk generated by the AI system. [The
impetus for such a riskdriven approach is that persons at risk and
vulnerable to health, safety, and rights infringement by new AI
technologies require a higher level of protection.]{.underline} This is
premised on the understanding that AI systems have certain
characteristics (inter alia, an opacity, complexity, dependency on data,
and capacity for autonomous behaviour) that can adversely and
significantly affect fundamental human rights---rights to data privacy,
transparency, autonomy, and the like.15 The Act addresses three
categories of risk: 1[. [Prohibited Systems]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Prohibited systems include [AI systems that [manipulate human
behavior]{.mark} and/or exploit persons' vulnerabilities; social scoring
systems; and, save for certain exceptions, "real-time" and "remote"
biometric identification (or facial recognition) systems. 2[. High-Risk
Systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. While not clearly defined, [a "high-risk"
system [is]{.mark} understood to be [one that poses significant risk to
health, safety, and fundamental rights]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Although
the AI Act applies generally to all AI systems, certain provisions
contained within the Act]{.underline} (and provided for in Title III)
[apply specifically to those considered high-risk.]{.underline}
High-risk systems are either those products (or safety components of
products) already covered by EU health and safety harmonisation
legislation (such as medical devices, toys, and machinery, for instance)
or those AI systems used in specified areas and contained in an annex to
the Act (such as educational training, employment, and law
enforcement).16 [[Rather than relying on certain criteria]{.mark} to
position a system as high-risk, [the Act designates as high-risk all AI
systems used within a specified enlisted and pre-determined
domain]{.mark}.]{.underline} There are also no gradations of high-risk
systems---either a system is high-risk, in which case compliance with a
comprehensive list of requirements and obligations is prescribed, or it
is not. [Once it has been established that an AI system is high-risk,
[it is mandated that the system's provider]{.mark}]{.underline} (the
person, agency, or body that develops an AI system or that has an AI
system developed with a view to placing it on the market or putting it
into service under its own name or trademark17) [must [fulfill certain
requirements and obligations]{.mark}. These requirements include that
[quality and risk management systems be implemented]{.mark}; that
[training, validation, and testing datasets be subject to appropriate
data governance and management practices and meet data quality]{.mark}
criteria; that [technical documentation be drawn up and proper records
be kept; and]{.mark} that [transparency]{.mark} obligations be
fulfilled.]{.underline}18 These obligations are set out in detail within
the Act. An important further requirement is that high-risk AI systems
be designed and developed to allow for human oversight so that natural
persons can oversee their functioning. [Providers are required to
introduce "human-machine interface tools" and measures to guarantee that
a system is subject to built-in operational constraints that cannot be
overridden by the system itself and is responsive only to a human
operator. 3[. Low- or Minimal-Risk Systems]{.mark}. All other AI systems
that [are without risk, or are of low or minimal risk, can be developed,
sold, and deployed without additional legal obligations]{.mark} subject,
of course, to compliance with any existing relevant
legislation]{.underline} (including data protection legislation, such as
the GDPR). Moreover, those that design and deploy low- or minimal-risk
systems are encouraged to adhere to voluntary codes of conduct.
[Disclosing Bots, Detecting Emotions, and Deep Fakes Although there are
no special requirements for low-risk systems, transparency obligations
apply to all risk-levels, and three categories of disclosable activities
are distinguished.]{.underline} First, providers of AI systems must
design systems so that natural persons are informed that they are
interacting with an AI system (so-called robot or "bot" disclosures).
[[This disclosure is to avoid any potential confusion by a natural
person when interacting with an AI system]{.mark}. It is not necessary
to make such a disclosure in instances where it is contextually obvious
that persons are interacting with an AI system.]{.underline} Second,
[users of systems that detect emotions or determine association with
(social) categories based on biometric data must be informed of the
operation of the system except in instances permitted by law or in crime
prevention]{.underline}. And lastly, [although certain exemptions apply,
[it is required that creators of artificial images, video, or audio
content disclose that they have been generated synthetically or
manipulated]{.mark}, such as in the case of "deep fakes."19
Extraterritorial Reach]{.underline} Crucially, if adopted in its
proposed form, the AI Act, much like the GDPR, [will be farreaching and
have significant consequences beyond the EU. The Act has
extraterritorial effect and, subject to certain specific
exceptions,]{.underline} applies to: [(i) providers that place on the
market or deploy AI systems in the EU, regardless of where such
providers are located; (ii) users of AI systems located within the EU;
and (iii) providers and users of AI systems that are located outside the
EU to the extent that the output produced by the system is used within
the EU.]{.underline} Conclusion: A Step in the Right Direction If the AI
Act is strikingly similar to the GDPR, it is perhaps no coincidence. Is
the AI Act likely to become the new global "gold standard" for the
adoption of AI regulation? [Will the EU be the sole and dominant
crafters of the laws governing technology? Certainly, many low- and
medium-resource countries look to regulations such as those promulgated
by the EU to guide and inform their new regulatory policy
development.]{.underline} To this end, and despite various shortcomings,
the Act is a valuable start in helping to shape global norms and
standards and promote trustworthy AI---AI systems that are, at least to
some degree, more consistent with human values and interests. [[The Act
also promotes innovation, including regulatory sandboxes and specific
measures to support small-scale users and providers]{.mark}. Some may
say that in preserving rights it does not go far enough, while
innovators and developers may argue that it goes too far]{.underline}.
But promoting ethical innovation and fair competition while balancing
rights is not easily done--- compromise is often needed---and the right
regulatory framework should (prudently) do both. But by covering too
much ground---fundamental rights, health and safety, data protection,
and consumer law---[there is a risk that the practical
operationalisation and implementation of the law may be untenable.
Further, a plausible framework should also be nuanced and flexible
enough to adapt to, and keep abreast of, the rapidly evolving landscape
that is AI development and deployment. Whether the AI Act does this
sufficiently in its present form remains to be seen.]{.underline}

**[Canada and the United States joined forty other countries in
[adopting the]{.mark} first ever set of [intergovernmental rules on the
use of artificial intelligence]{.mark} (]{.underline}**AI) at a
conference in Paris on Wednesday, as the technology promises potential
benefit and fuels ethical and other concerns. The [[four-page
document]{.underline}](https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0449)
**[[the nations\' representatives]{.mark} put their signatures to
[stress]{.mark}es [AI should be developed and implemented fairly and
safely]{.mark}, urging governments [to create policies for "responsible
stewardship of trustworthy AI."]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}The
guidelines were **[drafted [through an initiative led by the
Organization for]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD]{.underline}**]{.mark}), which brought together more
than 50 experts from industry, 20 governments, civil society and tech
companies. They aim to provide a stable environment for the development
and implementation of AI through shared fundamental values. "AI
technology is still in its infancy and its potential remains to be
realized,\" OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría said at the official
adoption of the principles on 22 May. \"And while AI is driving
optimism, it is also fueling anxiety and ethical concerns," he added.
**[The principles include five value]{.underline}**-**[based principles
for the development of AI]{.underline}** and five recommendations for
public policy[**[. The document states that AI should benefit people and
planet]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and be designed [in a way that respects
the rule of]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[law, human rights, democratic
values and diversity]{.underline}**]{.mark}. AI systems should be
transparent and safe. Their risks should continually be assessed and
managed. And those developing, deploying or operating AI systems should
be held accountable for their use of the technology, it reads. **[The
[OECD experts]{.mark} also [recommend]{.mark} that [governments
facilitate]{.mark} investment in research and development, foster
accessibility to [AI systems by sharing data and knowledge, create
policy to ensure citizens trust in AI systems]{.mark}, train displaced
people]{.underline}** **[with skills [to help with smoother economic
transition]{.mark}, cooperate]{.underline}** **[with other governments
to share best practices]{.underline}**. Artificial intelligence is
already displacing some human employment, and unease about how far that
trend will go will need to be dealt with as its application to more
problems grows. As a general purpose technology it will affect all
fields, and so the principles deal with all the potential consequences
and benefits of AI from the economic impact for workers to how data
gathered will be used for healthcare, traffic management, advertising or
any other purposes. **[The principles are not legally
binding]{.underline}** but **[it will allow the OECD to
monitor]{.underline}** and compare **[the progress of the 42 signatories
in their development and use of AI]{.underline}**. The OECD also has a
history of producing policy documents that contribute to later national
and international legislation. Their [[1980 privacy
guidelines]{.underline}](https://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecd_privacy_framework.pdf),
which highlighted the need to set limits on **[[the collection and use
of personal data, was the groundwork policy which the European
Union]{.mark} considered for its General Data Protection Regulation law.
[The OECD is a 36-member club of developed countries that describe
themselves as committed to democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[and the
market economy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** All members signed the AI
document, as did Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru and
Romania. OECD officials in charge of the initiative said they were
satisfied that many countries worked together to develop and agree to
the principles and they hoped more countries will adopt them. "Our
ambition goes far beyond our membership," said Andrew Wyckoff, director
for science, technology and innovation at the OECD.

among other uses[. **[Gurría, the OECD\'s secretary-general,
confirmed]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[more general fears around the
development of AI.]{.underline}** \"There are questions around the
trustworthiness, the robustness of AI systems including the dangers of
codifying or reinforcing existing biases related to gender, race, or
infringing on human rights of important values like privacy,\" he said
during his opening address. The United States was among signatories keen
for the document to reinforce democratic values centred on human rights,
officials said. "With \[their participation\], **[[the US was keen on

Compared to companies that approach AI in a piecemeal manner, these
leaders (just over a third in our survey) are far more likely (36%
versus 20%) to report widespread AI adoption. **[They're roughly twice
as likely to rep9ort substantial value from AI initiatives to improve
productivity, decision-making, customer experience, product and service

approach facilitates scale and data sharing. It brings together AI
specialists with analytics teams, software engineers and data

cloud-based computing power that can scale up and down to help meet
demands. An approach to AI initiatives that encompasses business,
technology and decision-making priorities helps data, AI and cloud work
together smoothly, end-to-end. This unified approach to **[AI aligns
well with a unified approach to data: making a person (such as a chief
data officer) or a centralized team responsible for data sharing and
data governance. That can help connect data to AI in ways that benefit
as many lines of business as possible. Thirty-six percent of companies
with a holistic approach to AI are planning to use AI this year to help
create a data fabric: an action-ready, 360-degree view of all data that
touches their organizations.]{.underline}** Within this framework, many
AI leaders plan to focus on five key priorities, all related to one
theme: delivering valuable, real-world business outcomes. AI-supported
decision-making is so powerful for a simple reason: it can enable you to
incorporate and analyze far more information than you (or any human
being) could do on their own. To help optimize pricing, for example, AI
can input reams of historical data on product sales, margins, supplier
costs and customer satisfaction, then produce rigorous estimates of
possible future scenarios. It can project how competitors and suppliers
might change their prices in response to your decisions. AI combined
with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can forecast machines' performance
and maintenance needs, enabling better operational decisions. With the
rise in "AI at the edge" --- **[[AI combined with edge computing, so AI
algorithms are executed at or near the device level --- these decisions
can be lightning fast, too. Start with outcomes]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
As you consider new AI models in decision-making, don't start with the
data you have. Instead, start with the business outcome you seek, then
look for the data and analytics to back it up. **[Consider which
decision-makers will use the model to achieve this outcome, where the
model will fit within the decision-making process, how it will integrate
with the cloud, and how you will monitor, scale, improve and eventually
retire it. Let AI make your data actionable]{.underline}.** Once you've
identified the data you need, let AI help you find and use it. Many
companies are drowning in unstructured, "messy" data. Whether with
[**[documents]{.underline}**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5_iO4gHoUo),
images or video, AI can wade through this ocean of data, extract exactly
what decision-makers need and put this data --- and only this data ---
in front of the right people at the right time. **[Focus, then scale. [A
holistic approach doesn't mean "everything at the same time." An
effective way to use AI in highly complex decisions, such as
ESG,]{.mark} is to start with a specific element, such as a single
facility's carbon footprint. You can then scale up to other facilities
and ESG factors]{.underline}**.What companies can do **Create synthetic
data.** Machine learning models require huge amounts of data --- which
simulation models can create. For facial recognition, for example,
instead of acquiring images of faces from multiple angles, contrast

these specialists together with each other and with business leaders is
key to solving simulation problems.]{.underline}** Companies are now
increasingly able to answer these and other questions, thanks to new
assessment methods. These can capture not just "hard" returns, such as
increased productivity, and "hard" costs, such as new hardware spending.
They can also capture "soft" returns, such as an improved employee
experience, and "soft" costs, such as increased demands on subject
matter specialists' time. The holistic approach to AI, by fostering
scale, shared insights and shared leading practices, also makes it
easier to predict the ROI of new initiatives. As you work to measure and
increase AI's ROI, you may also be able to take advantage of AI itself:
its simulations can model the uncertainties that surround other AI
initiatives, helping to better allocate resources. What companies can do
**Be complete.** As you use the [**[new
methods]{.underline}**](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/artificial-intelligence-roi.html)
to assess and predict AI's ROI, be sure to factor in uncertainties (such
as AI models' exact error rate), changes in model performance and
maintenance needs over time, and how different AI initiatives could
impact each other's results. **Build a portfolio.** To help avoid ROI
surprises, consider a [**[portfolio
approach]{.underline}**](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/how-ai-portfolio-helps-roi.html):
as you might do with financial investments or product innovation, create
and assess a mix of initiatives that will raise the likelihood of
delivering the overall results you need. **Manage the life cycle.**
**[[To further predict and boost AI's ROI, aim to manage not individual
AI projects, but an integrated data-AI-cloud (DAC) life cycle.]{.mark}
That can help you continually evolve strategy, fine-tune execution and
find new use cases for data --- both avoiding downside surprises and
identifying new value. Given the widespread understanding

urgency]{.underline}**](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/artificial-intelligence/what-is-responsible-ai.html),
the lack of action likely reflects the challenges. Responsible AI
requires both technology and business experience. AI professionals may,
for example, miss the impact on compliance or the brand when AI makes
decisions based on historical data sets, which may be rife with
historically common biases. Business and risk experts may lack the
technical skills to forecast how highly complex algorithms may perform
as circumstances change. **[[And since AI continuously evolves its own

AI in the labor market today is to help people to do better work,
reducing the pressure to fill hard-to-fill positions. That's true both
for routine tasks, which AI-backed automation can perform to save
employees' time, and for advanced, AI-specific roles. AI can, for
example, often conduct even sophisticated data science tasks, helping
compensate for the shortage of data scientists. **Make employees

work life easier and more engaging. By giving them the opportunity and

[**[One of the principles of evolutionary psychology states that
adaptation is the act of making up for past
shortfalls]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Therefore, it is only natural for
military leaders to pursue new capabilities that will ensure their
troops are more fit and prepared to respond to changes in national
security strategy, and to operate in complex combat environments.
**[[Rapid advancements in technology have changed the conduct of
war.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Like the introduction of the spear and
shield in ancient societies, the invention of the tank, aircraft and
combat ships have shaped the warfare tactics of modern societies.59
D**[efense officials have witnessed the effects of growing innovations
in technology and the enemy's application of its use on the
battlefield]{.underline}**. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and
explosively formed penetrators (EFPs) activated by long range cellular
transmitters came as a surprise to forces entering Iraq and Afghanistan.
As a result, the military has changed its strategy, tactics, and
technology to stay abreast of the changing operating picture and the
nuances of asymmetric conflict. Diminishing conservative strategies
along with the continued development of more sophisticated enemy
operations had triggered a phase of transformation within the DoD to
create a more dynamic force to maintain battlefield superiority and
information dominance. **[[An example is the employment of autonomous
weapon systems]{.mark} like]{.underline}** t**[he MQ-9 Reaper UAV that
can gather intelligence through surveillance technologies, independently
select and discriminate targets, and render lethal effects with minimal
collateral damage.]{.underline}** Though technology continues to evolve
and increase the lethality of today's battlefield, it is unimaginable to
think that these technologies will ever replace the human factor of
warfare. The diverse nature of current combat operations has heightened
awareness of the continued importance of the individual soldier. **[[The
soldier and his team have always been the most critical integrated
combat system]{.mark} and like the UAV, these assets require
optimization to increase performance and promote their effectiveness and
lethality of the battlefield. The military found that the best way to
defeat this asymmetric threat it to employ small groups of elite
soldiers who are physically and mentally fit to withstand the rigors of
war.]{.underline}** The surge during the Bush administration called for
over 92,000 troops to conduct counterinsurgency operations in Iraq. To
achieve the mandated quota, standards for recruitment were lowered,
resulting in a force that was very clearly substandard with regard to IQ
and physical prowess.60 Statistics released by the National Priorities
Project provide a closer look at some very disheartening data on the
quality of U.S. military recruits. The report shows that in 2007 only 70
percent of the population of military recruits had a high school
diploma, which is significantly lower than the traditional accession
goal of 96.8 percent and a decline not seen since WWII and Vietnam. In
the same year, based on Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) scores
only 44.9 percent of recruits were categorized as high quality, which
was an 11 percent decrease from 2005. Another grim detail highlighted in
the report shows that the military increased their minimum percentage
recruitment standard for personnel falling within the "Category IV"
aptitude range to .4 percent. Soldiers that fall within this category
are considered below average trainability and past DoD policy restricted
Category IV enlistment to no more than .2 percent. **[On a good note,
[despite not yet meeting prescribed objectives, the quality of soldiers
within the armed forces is steadily progressing]{.mark}.61 An article by
journalist Fred Kaplan states that "a dumber army is a weaker army" and
in the era of persistent asymmetric conflict soldier are required to be
stronger and more intelligent to overcome the obstacle imposed by this
type of warfare.]{.underline}**62 This data does not intend to label the
military as an institution of idiots rather it shows that in times of
increased operational need the organization may not get the caliber of
personnel it requires. **[[In a technical report released in 2003 by
Strategic Analysis, Inc., officials from]{.mark} the [DARPA state that

research continues to unlock genetic codes, moving researchers closer to
their desired goal of creating the "super soldier." **[[The]{.mark}

promote the rapid wound healing and recovery.]{.underline}** Soldiers
will be able to detect adverse situations and quickly traverse complex
targets via their optimized ability to solve problems. Heightened
endurance and lessened fatigue will ensure unit success during extended
combat operations. The idea is simple: whether a threat is conventional
or complex, **[[the soldier that possesses more superior physiological

possible benefits of genetic engineering because it could potentially
lessen the innate limitations of the American soldier bringing them to
parity with other decisive large platform weapon systems.

[The Pentagon cannot let TEVV become a barrier to fielding AI-enabled
systems in an operationally relevant time frame, but must do so in a
manner that engenders trust in such systems]{.underline} and is
consistent with U.S. values and principles. [The ultimate goal of any
TEVV system 4 should be to build trust---with a commander who is
responsible for deploying a system and an operator who will decide
whether to delegate a task to such system]{.underline}---by providing
relevant, easily understandable data to inform decision-making[.
Fielding AI systems before our competitors may not matter if DOD systems
are brittle and break in an operational environment, are easily
manipulated, or operators consequently lose faith in them. Military
operations present a challenging environment. The Defense Department
needs ML/DL systems that are robust and secure. They need to be able to
function in a range of environmental conditions, against adversaries who
are adaptive and clever, and in a manner that engenders trust by the
warfighter.]{.underline}

[Second, the context in which DOD operates means these technologies are
prone to adversary attack and system failure, with very real
consequences.]{.underline} [Machine learning systems have an increased
potential for failure modes]{.underline} relative to other systems,
[such as bias due to a distribution shift in data, as well as novel
vulnerabilitie]{.underline}s to attacks ranging from [data poisoning to
adversarial attacks]{.underline}. [One could easily imagine an image
classifier that accidentally classifies a civilian school bus as a tank
or an adversary exfiltrating a model processing sensitive intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance or communications data.]{.underline}
Image classification algorithms developed for one environment (e.g., the
desert) could turn out to work incorrectly in another environment (e.g.,
cities).

Third, with an effective TEVV system, the United States can reduce
barriers to innovation and facilitate U.S. leadership in ML/DL
technologies. As most of the innovation in ML/DL will come from the
private sector, unless the U.S. government is able to effectively draw

development in a manner consistent with DOD standards for safety,
reliability, and accountability. It will lose the opportunity to take
advantage of new private sector developments, while allowing other
nations without such standards to adopt the latest innovations. It is
critical that the U.S. government not only shape its own U.S. industry
standards but also promote compatible global standards and norms.

Fourth, [adversary advancements will likely increase pressure to field
AI-enabled systems faster]{.underline}, even if testing and assurance
are lacking. [China has elevated AI to be a major national priority
across sectors and is already exporting armed drones with varying
degrees of autonomy.3 Russia is also pursuing R&D on AI for military 5
purposes4 and fields AI-enabled robotic systems in Syria with little
regard for ethical considerations.5 However, it shouldn't be a race
against our competitors to field AI systems at any cost. It's a race to
field robust, lawful, and secure AI systems that can be trusted to
perform as intended.]{.underline}

[Finally, high standards for robustness, assurance, interpretability,
and governability can ultimately be a tremendous source of strategic
advantage, incentivizing industry to harden systems to adversary
attack.]{.underline} Taken together, [these risks and opportunities
suggest that devising an effective, efficient, and ethical TEVV process
is critical for maintaining the U.S. military and economic competitive
edge]{.underline}, as well as deploying reliable and trustworthy ML/DL
systems.

[The Defense Department needs to reform its existing testing and

understand and manage the risks of developing, producing, operating, and

research and development of AI systems that are resilient, robust,
reliable, and secure; we will continue to fund research into techniques
that produce more explainable AI; and we will pioneer approaches for AI
test, evaluation, verification, and validation." However, DOD has yet to
translate this stated goal into a real plan of action.]{.underline}
Advancing the Defense Department's TEVV enterprise for ML/DL systems is
critical for several reasons. First, [developing an effective TEVV
approach that is sufficiently predictive of performance is critical to
building the trust in these systems necessary to deploy and leverage
these capabilities at scale. The United States has already seen this
dynamic with nuclear power, for example, where lost trust in the
technology has prevented policymakers from harnessing nuclear power for
clean energy]{.underline}

[for the next five to 10 years, the Defense Department will likely rely
on supervised learning systems, and testing ML/DL systems will likely
require large sets of labeled, representative data]{.underline}. The
United States needs a whole-of-government data strategy that allows for
data collection, cleaning, curation, and sharing across agencies,
especially between DOD and the IC. [Currently, the Defense Department
lacks sufficient available data that mimics the conflict condition in
which these systems may operate in the future. This will limit its
ability to test system performance against realistic
conditions.]{.underline} It will also hamstring efforts to identify edge
cases and develop fail-safe mechanisms to prevent catastrophic outcomes.
[The Pentagon lacks the ability to effectively collect, manage, store,
and share testing data across the enterprise, which would enable this
approach to scale]{.underline}. Finally, DOD leadership will need
approaches to continuously test the quality of the data itself, as
testing data could be compromised or revealed unintentionally or
intentionally by adversaries. ML/DL will be integrated into a system of
systems. ML/DL will be integrated into a range of DOD software and
hardware systems, so it is imperative that developers, testers, and
policymakers take a systems architecture view when building and
evaluating these systems. [The Defense Department cannot simply test all
components separately and assume that the system as a whole will work as
intended]{.underline}. The accuracy and precision of ML/DL systems is
typically a composite effect that arises from a combination of the
behaviors of different components, such as the training data, the
learning program, and even the learning framework. These components are
then embedded in larger systems, so interactions with the physical,
computational, and human components of the system will ultimately affect
system performance. [Often, failures come from unexpected interactions
or relationships between systems, rather than the behavior of any
individual element. These dynamics make the system increasingly
vulnerable to malfunction and cyber-attacks.]{.underline} An adversary
could attack any number of vulnerable entry points within the hardware
or software that could, in turn, compromise the entire system.11 The
Defense Department needs to greatly advance its ability to conduct
integrated systems testing that takes into account the interactions with
and between systems, testing both machine-machine and human-machine
interactions. It should also prioritize testing for how failure in a
given subsystem could impact the performance of the system as a whole.

### 2NC \-\-- SpaceX solves AI

#### SpaceX has autonomous Spaceships now -- it can implement the plan

Neel V. **Patel**, 7-3-20**20**, \"Are we making spacecraft too
autonomous?,\" MIT Technology Review,
https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/03/1004788/spacecraft-spacefight-autonomous-software-ai/

When SpaceX's Crew Dragon took NASA astronauts to the ISS near the end
of May, the launch brought back a familiar sight. For the first time
since the space shuttle was retired, American rockets were launching
from American soil to take Americans into space.

[Inside the vehicle, however, things couldn't have looked more
different. Gone was the sprawling dashboard of lights and switches and
knobs that once dominated the space shuttle's interior. All of it was
replaced with a futuristic console of multiple large touch screens that
cycle through a variety of displays. Behind those screens, the vehicle
is run by software that's designed to get into space and navigate to the
space station completely autonomously.]{.underline}

"Growing up as a pilot, my whole career, having a certain way to control
a vehicle---this is certainly different," Doug Hurley told NASA TV
viewers shortly before the SpaceX mission. Instead of calling for a hand
on the control stick, navigation is now a series of predetermined
inputs. The [SpaceX astronauts may still be involved in decision-making
at critical junctures, but much of that function has moved out of their
hands.]{.underline}

Does this matter? [Software has never played a more critical role in
spaceflight. It has made it safer and more efficient, allowing a
spacecraft to automatically adjust to changing conditions. According to
Darrel Raines, a NASA engineer leading software development for the
Orion deep space capsule, autonomy is particularly key for areas of
"critical response time"---like the ascent of a rocket after
liftoff]{.underline}, when a problem might require initiating an abort
sequence in just a matter of seconds. Or in instances where the crew
might be incapacitated for some reason.

And increased autonomy is practically essential to making some forms of
spaceflight even work. Ad Astra is a Houston-based company that's
looking to make plasma rocket propulsion technology viable. The
experimental engine uses plasma made out of argon gas, which is heated
using electromagnetic waves. A "tuning" process overseen by the system's
software automatically figures out the optimal frequencies for this
heating. The engine comes to full power in just a few milliseconds.
"There's no way for a human to respond to something like that in time,"
says CEO Franklin Chang Díaz, a former astronaut who flew on several
space shuttle missions from 1986 to 2002[. Algorithms in the control
system are used to recognize changing conditions in the rocket as it's
moving through the startup sequence---and act accordingly]{.underline}.
"We wouldn't be able to do any of this well without software," he says.

[But overrelying on software and autonomous systems in spaceflight
creates new opportunities for problems to arise. That's especially a
concern for many of the space industry's new contenders, who aren't
necessarily used to the kind of aggressive and comprehensive testing
needed to weed out problems in software and are still trying to strike a
good balance between automation and manual control.]{.underline}

space shuttle Atlantis

The Space Shuttle Atlantis had a more traditional dashboard for its
pilots to utilize.

inflight video of Dragon 2 mission

The Crew Dragon capsule replaces the knobs and switches with large
touchscreens.

Nowadays, a few errors in over one million lines of code could spell the
difference between mission success and mission failure. We saw that late
last year, when Boeing's Starliner capsule (the other vehicle NASA is
counting on to send American astronauts into space) failed to make it to
the ISS because of a glitch in its internal timer. A human pilot could
have overridden the glitch that ended up burning Starliner's thrusters
prematurely. NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine remarked soon after
Starliner's problems arose: "Had we had an astronaut on board, we very
well may be at the International Space Station right now."

But it was later revealed that many other errors in the software had not
been caught before launch, including one that could have led to the
destruction of the spacecraft. And that was something human crew members
could easily have overridden.

Boeing is certainly no stranger to building and testing spaceflight
technologies, so it was a surprise to see the company fail to catch
these problems before the Starliner test flight. "Software defects,
particularly in complex spacecraft code, are not unexpected," NASA said
when the second glitch was made public. "However, there were numerous
instances where the Boeing software quality processes either should have
or could have uncovered the defects." Boeing declined a request for
comment.

According to Luke Schreier, the vice president and general manager of
aerospace at NI (formerly National Instruments), problems in software
are inevitable, whether in autonomous vehicles or in spacecraft. "That's
just life," he says. The only real solution is to aggressively test
ahead of time to find those issues and fix them: "You have to have a
really rigorous software testing program to find those mistakes that
will inevitably be there."

Enter AI

Space, however, is a unique environment to test for. The conditions a
spacecraft will encounter aren't easy to emulate on the ground. While an
autonomous vehicle can be taken out of the simulator and eased into
lighter real-world conditions to refine the software little by little,
you can't really do the same thing for a launch vehicle. Launch,
spaceflight, and a return to Earth are actions that either happen or
they don't---there is no "light" version.

This, says Schreier, is why AI is such a big deal in spaceflight
nowadays---you can develop an autonomous system that is capable of
anticipating those conditions, rather than requiring the conditions to
be learned during a specific simulation. "You couldn't possibly simulate
on your own all the corner cases of the new hardware you're designing,"
he says.

So for some groups, testing software isn't just a matter of finding and
fixing errors in the code; it's also a way to train AI-driven software.
Take Virgin Orbit, for example, which recently tried to send its
LauncherOne vehicle into space for the first time. The company worked
with NI to develop a test bench that looped together all the vehicle's
sensors and avionics with the software meant to run a mission into orbit
(down to the exact length of wiring used within the vehicle). By the
time LauncherOne was ready to fly, it believed it had already been in
space thousands of times thanks to the testing, and it had already faced
many different kinds of scenarios.

Of course, the LauncherOne's first test flight ended in failure, for
reasons that have still not been disclosed. If it was due to software
limitations, the attempt is yet another sign there's a limit to how much
an AI can be trained to face real-world conditions.

Raines adds that in contrast to the slower approach NASA takes for
testing, private companies are able to move much more rapidly. For some,
like SpaceX, this works out well. For others, like Boeing, it can lead
to some surprising hiccups.

Ultimately, "the worst thing you can do is make something fully manual
or fully autonomous," says Nathan Uitenbroek, another NASA engineer
working on Orion's software development. Humans have to be able to
intervene if the software is glitching up or if the computer's memory is
destroyed by an unanticipated event (like a blast of cosmic rays). But
they also rely on the software to inform them when other problems arise.

NASA is used to figuring out this balance, and it has redundancy built
into its crewed vehicles. The space shuttle operated on multiple
computers using the same software, and if one had a problem, the others
could take over. A separate computer ran on entirely different software,
so it could take over the entire spacecraft if a systemic glitch was
affecting the others. Raines and Uitenbroek say the same redundancy is
used on Orion, which also includes a layer of automatic function that
bypasses the software entirely for critical functions like parachute
release.

On the Crew Dragon, there are instances where astronauts can manually
initiate abort sequences, and where they can override software on the
basis of new inputs. But the design of these vehicles means it's more
difficult now for the human to take complete control. The touch-screen
console is still tied to the spacecraft's software, and you can't just
bypass it entirely when you want to take over the spacecraft, even in an
emergency.

There's no consensus on how much further the human role in spaceflight
will---or should---shrink. Uitenbroek thinks trying to develop software
that can account for every possible contingency is simply impractical,
especially when you have deadlines to make.

Chang Díaz disagrees, saying the world is shifting "to a point where
eventually the human is going to be taken out of the equation."

Which approach wins out may depend on the level of success achieved by
the different parties sending people into space. NASA has no intention
of taking humans out of the equation, but if commercial

Blitz

**INTRODUCTION** 5G is expected to provide the connective tissue for
many emerging technologies critical to productivity, innovation, and
national competitiveness. Some commentators have panicked over the
so-called "race" for 5G, pointing in fear at China's hundreds of
thousands of new base stations, and projections of hundreds of millions
of 5G subscribers this year alone. But if we are going to base policy
decisions on this race (and it is questionable that we should),
understanding how infrastructure and subscription numbers are actually
counted matters. A closer look reveals that China's wireless
infrastructure and subscriber numbers are not as impressive as they may
first appear: By counting anyone on a 5G plan---even if they only have a
4G device connecting to 4G infrastructure---as a 5G subscriber, and
measuring individual base stations instead of cell sites, China's 5G
stats can paint a misleading picture. This misleading picture leads to
the interpretation that the sky is falling. **THE SKY IS FALLING: CLAIMS
THAT CHINA IS BEATING THE UNITED STATES AT 5G** [One can barely scan a
technology news site without reading that the United States is losing to
China in 5G]{.underline}, and that this will mean economic catastrophe.
Headlines such as "China's Dominance Of 5G Networks Puts U.S. Economic
Future At Stake" and "China's growing 5G dominance is a disaster for US
security" keep policymakers on edge when considering how the United
States should move forward with the next generation of wireless.1 The
fear is that the first country to build 5G networks will have a head
start in developing the emerging technologies that depend on 5G's
low-latency, high-throughput wireless connectivity. As Attorney General
William Barr put it, "China's success in 5G infrastructure is also
translating into advantages in a range of new technologies associated
with 5G."2 He claimed, "Within the next five years, 5G global territory
and application dominance will be determined," and "the stakes for the
United States could not be higher."3 Are these Chicken Littles to be
believed[? Certainly, China has advantages in deploying 5G
infrastructure,]{.underline} with state-directed companies making
investments that market actors might not. But it is important we have a
strong understanding of the metrics of Chinese 5G deployment, and the
methodology for counting before calling the 5G race. **5G USERS VERSUS
SUBSCRIBERS** [Many reports likely overstate the extent of Chinese 5G
deployment]{.underline} for several reasons. Part of this is likely due
to intentional inflation of statistics reported by operators under
pressure from Chinese authorities. [This is a long-standing practice in
China, going back at least as far as Mao and agricultural communes
reporting fake crop yields so as not to displease
leadership]{.underline}.4 And today they are not unique to the telecom
sector, as organizations of all kinds inflate numbers in order to meet
Beijing's expectations. The Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology (MIIT) put out a statement encouraging telecommunications
providers to "accelerate user migration to 5G through measures such as
package upgrade offer, and credit purchases, etc."5 Providers then
started encouraging or even forcing customers to upgrade to 5G
subscriptions regardless of their actual need, use, or device.6 Some
companies reduced 5G subscription prices so much they are even cheaper
than staying on a 4G plan.7 As one reporter put it, "\[W\]ith all of
China's big telcos slashing 5G package prices in the past few months, it
could well be that customers are being drawn in more by attractive
tariffs than by a desire to get their hands on the latest hardware and
its related capabilities."8 The push for 5G subscribers was evident
before 5G was even activated: Although 5G service was not turned on in
China until November of 2019, Chinese telecom providers listed 9 million
5G users in October 2019, a month prior to its actual activation.9 By
counting anyone on a 5G plan---even if they only have a 4G device
connecting to 4G infrastructure---as a 5G subscriber, and measuring
individual base stations instead of cell sites, China's 5G stats paint a
misleading picture. Apparently, the numbers game went too far, as the
MIIT later called upon providers to "clean up" reporting and end
aggressive sales practices after news of subscriber inflation spread.10
But current numbers are still plagued with confusion. Consider that
China Telecom and China Mobile (the two largest operators in China)
reported 150 million "5G package customers" as of September 2020. But
according to China's Academy for Information and Communications
Technology, only 94 million 5G devices had been shipped for all of China
during the same time frame, indicating a sizable gap between the number
of "subscribers" and actual 5G users.11 The discrepancy may be due
largely to terminology: "5G package customers" is a blanket term often
used by Chinese carriers to refer to anyone on a 5G subscription,
regardless of whether they actually have a 5G device or access to a 5G
network.12 China Mobile acknowledges that they count anyone "who has
subscribed to 5G tariff plans" as a 5G customer.13 The number of
5G-capable devices alone is impressive, and the competitive threat from
China justifies a thoughtful policy response, but no one should be
worked into a panic by goosed stats. **NETWORK DEPLOYMENT: BASE STATIONS
VERSUS CELL SITES** [Subscriptions are not the only potentially
misunderstood stat. Chinese operators tend to count mobile
infrastructure differently from how Western operators generally
do]{.underline}. The key difference is between cell sites (how U.S.
telecommunications operators typically measure deployment) and base
stations (how Chinese telecommunications operators typically measure
deployment). A cell site usually refers to the entire area of a given
tower, which includes potentially multiple base stations and antennas
using different spectrum. The term "base station" generally refers to
the equipment each carrier uses to send signals over multiple antennas
at the cell site. Often one cell site will have multiple base stations,
sometimes it will host only one. But generally, it is not a one-to-one
conversion between base stations and cell sites or towers; It is
important that these numbers are not conflated to mean the same thing.
Deployment figures are often further mischaracterized because of the way
Chinese operators sometimes count each spectrum band as a separate
"logical" base station instead of actual pieces of equipment.14 Just
like how a Wi-Fi router can work on different spectrum (generally 2.4
GHz and 5 GHz), a mobile base station can operate on multiple spectrum
bands. American carriers would generally count a multi-spectrum base
station as at most one piece of equipment. But some Chinese reporting
apparently treats each individual spectrum band a base station supports
as a different "logical site."15 A representative from Huawei explained
that "a China Unicom base station supports GSM 900, GSM 1800, WCDMA 2100
and LTE. Most of the equipment is deployed in the same room at one
physical site, but there are four bands, so there are four logical
sites."16 As a result, [Chinese numbers could easily be misrepresented
as three to four times higher compared with how Western operators tend
to count equipment]{.underline}.17 Policymakers and the media should
take care not to conflate estimates of base stations for logical sites
with actual, physical cell sites---these are two totally different
measurements. For a rough comparison, it seems fair to assume two or
three base stations per cell site, but the number of logical
sites---meaning each spectrum band used---could be many more. **ACTUAL
PERFORMANCE** The raw number of base stations is not always a good
measure of a network's performance. What we really care about is a
network's performance for the population it covers. Measuring
performance becomes increasingly complicated with 5G's diverse spectrum
assets, some of which do not use the traditional cellular architecture.
The utilization of different spectrum resources or amounts of bandwidth
results in varying levels of performance even with equal levels of
infrastructure. This is relevant when comparing China, which so far uses
exclusively mid-band spectrum for 5G, with the United States, which has
made a large push to focus on high-band coverage. High-band 5G offers
the highest performance leap over existing networks, at least where it
is available. But that being said, let's try a rough comparison,
assuming the similar spectrum assets and using China's announcement that
it anticipates 600,000 5G base stations by the end of 2020.18 Assume
three base stations per Chinese cell site---one for each of the major
operators---and we get about 200,000 sites. This could be several times
lower if we're talking logical sites, but it is hard to say---let's keep
the estimate conservative and set that issue aside. [The population
served also plays a big role in the performance of a given network.
China's population is about 1.39 billion. This is about 4.5 times larger
than that of the United States, indicating Chinese operators will need
roughly 4.5 times as many base stations as their U.S. counterparts to
get a similar level of performance for each user]{.underline} (all else
being equal). So, those 200,000 sites work out to about 1 site per 7,000
people. In 2019 alone, U.S. operators invested in 5G-ready cell sites
and added 46,000 new cell sites---roughly 1 site per 7,134 people.19 To
the uninformed, 600,000 base stations might sound alarming, but
understanding what those numbers mean, we're about neck-and-neck. If we
assume that the Chinese sites include logical sites, and the spectral
efficiency of their base stations is less, then it appears the United
States is clearly in the lead. [Slow and steady may win the race.
Whereas the United States is pursuing a gradual, economical deployment
of 5G, the problems with China's rushed 5G deployments are already
starting to show]{.underline}. One of Huawei's own executives went so
far as to call China's 5G "fake, dumb and poor," mostly due to poor
integration with the 4G network.21 Another former official warned in a
recent speech that China's 5G push could become a failed investment.22
While China is no doubt investing substantially in the expansion of its
5G network, including by pressuring its state-owned carriers to invest
faster than the market demands, Chinese figures must be properly
scrutinized when using them to make U.S. policy decisions.

### 2NC \-\-- Solves China 

#### Domestic investment solves the race against China for 5G

**Peterson 18** - \[Erik R. Peterson, 2018, \"5G is the key to future
American competitiveness,\" Germany,

The telecom industry's race for 5G is one of the most intense and
consequential technological contests of our time. What will it take to
win? As the global race to develop and deploy 5G telecommunications
networks heats up, the [urgency for **American investment** in its
digital infrastructure is rising in tandem]{.underline}. [Rapid and
large-scale deployment of 5G would not only help the United States
maintain its economic and technological edge globally, but it would also
offer an opportunity to realize three other national
objectives.]{.underline} First, it would [support the transition of the
economy to the Fourth Industrial Revolution ushered in by dramatic
technology innovations]{.underline}. Second, it would [promote a
stronger, more innovative, and more competitive business landscape,
which in turn would support sustainable and high-paying
jobs]{.underline}. Finally, it would provide increased access,
benefiting both local communities and the private sector in under-served
areas. The stakes are extraordinarily high. The [first country to
achieve large-scale, reliable 5G coverage stands to reap significant
economic gains---starting with higher technological innovation, elevated
economic growth, and strengthened **national
competitiveness**]{.underline}. The returns will be far larger than
upfront investments. 5G: a world of change A new era of the digital
economy was unleashed as wireless networks evolved from voice-only 2G,
to voice and text, and then to the latest Internet-enabled 4G LTE
technology. Once fully deployed, 5G will be similarly transformative,
given its ability to support massive Machine to Machine (M2M)
communications through greater bandwidth, such as between cellphones,
sensors, "smart" machinery and appliances, and other Internet of Things
(IoT) devices. In addition to IoT, 5G will support a range of new and
future applications in each of the other next-generation technologies at
the core of the [future of
production](https://www.atkearney.com/operations-performance-transformation/article/-/insights/readiness-for-the-future-of-production-report-2018)---artificial
intelligence, robotics, additive manufacturing, and augmented and
virtual reality (AR/VR). There is no doubt that 5G will have a
significant impact on American consumers. One obvious way will be from
performance improvement, such as faster video streaming and real-time
gaming thanks to the reduced latency provided by 5G networks. Kearney's
recent
[Health@250](https://www.atkearney.com/web/health250/executive-summary)
report highlighted how mobile health solutions from wearables, IoT
devices, and related technologies will take advantage of 5G for improved
data collection and real-time monitoring, while other advances such as
remote surgery will also become possible. The power and convenience of
5G may even contribute to the next wave of "cord cutting" in fixed
services---particularly given 5G\'s potential as a way to provide
high-speed connectivity to customers currently underserved by existing
fixed broadband infrastructure. Process innovation: an essential
ingredient of competitive advantage Companies and their R&D arms are
rethinking the way they manufacture both old and new products. In
today's hyper-competitive world, are you exploring every opportunity to
innovate? 5G will also have a significant impact on the B2B market. The
entire ICT industry---from chipmakers to telecom companies to hardware
and software manufacturers---is building out this technology with B2B
customers and "things" top of mind. Businesses will have countless
devices talking to one another as well as to the cloud, streaming
massive amounts of data. While IoT devices are already proliferating
rapidly due to the connectivity offered by today's LTE networks, 5G will
further enhance connectivity for these devices due to network slicing,
improved spectrum efficiency, and better power management. As a result,
businesses will be able to better manage fields and factories with much
lower latency than is possible with current WLAN networks, track goods
in real time along their supply chains, and follow products from the
retail shelf into the home. Data sharing will also be multidirectional.
For instance, a truck tire will simultaneously collect data on wear and
tear, road conditions, temperature, and air pressure for both the
vehicle owner and the tire manufacturer, providing crucial inputs for
maintenance schedules and future product development. Finally, take
"[smart cities](https://www.atkearney.com/global-cities/full-report),"
which promise better traffic management, improved car safety, and route
optimization. What makes them "smart" is the ability of their systems to
share large amounts of data instantly between other cars, road sensors,
traffic lights, and other devices. And while there is always a trade-off
between supporting M2M and latency in any network, 5G will see
improvements in both, leading to significantly improved performance
across the spectrum of 5G use cases. According to Rob Thies, general
partner at World Innovation Lab Ventures, "5G is as big as the
transition from dial-up to DSL, and will change the world just as much."
[Qualcomm estimates](https://qualcomm.com/invention/5g/economy) that the
global 5G value chain will be \$3.5 trillion by 2035, which is larger
than the entire mobile value chain today. Add to that another \$12.3
trillion in "5G-enabled" growth. For the United States, the projected
economic impact is no less staggering. The telecommunications industry
association CTIA estimates that 5G will create three million new jobs,
on top of a wireless industry that already supports 4.7 million workers.
It will also generate an estimated \$500 billion in economic
growth---including 5G-enabled innovation by startups and major companies
alike that will add new economic value. The efficiency and speed with
which 5G delivers these economic and social benefits, however, will
depend on the scale, timeline, and geographic scope of the investments
made by the mobile operators, as well as how friendly government
policies are to 5G adoption, including wireless spectrum auction
processes. Importantly, 5G opens up enormous new blocks of spectrum,
making it most cost-effective to serve the relentless rise in traffic on
networks. What are the incentives for 5G? A key incentive for making
such an investment is the potential for new revenue streams,
accomplished in part by working more closely with B2B companies. For
example, given the significant B2B market for 5G capabilities, it is
likely that changes will occur in the cost structures for what are known
as "over-the-top," or OTT, services such as current video content
providers and future AR/VR services and autonomous vehicle operators, as
well as their relationships with telecom companies. For example, Tesla
is [partnering with
Intel](https://teslanomics.co/tesla-model-3-and-others-will-uses-intel-for-5g/)
to bring 5G connectivity to its vehicles. Further, Ericsson estimates
the potential market size for industry digitalization that telecoms
could tap into will be nearly \$620 billion by 2026. We therefore expect
to see considerable experimentation and innovation in this space in the
coming years. B2C will also provide incentives for investment in 5G,
particularly as mobile use continues to rise globally. As reinforced by
the Mary Meeker's [2018 Internet trends
report](https://www.recode.net/2018/5/30/17385116/mary-meeker-slides-internet-trends-code-conference-2018),
mobile Internet usage remains the key driver of digital media
consumption. Global average smartphone costs continue to decline, mobile
payments are increasingly standard, and the mobile experience is
becoming further ingrained in people's daily lives. With 5G, more
services can be brought to mobile, further amplifying the scope for
innovation. The global 5G race [**Major economies** around the

for 5G amid a broader effort to strengthen its digital economy,
including through its "Made in China 2025" initiative]{.underline}.
South Korea used the occasion of the 2018 Olympics to demonstrate its 5G
prowess. A [drone connected to a 5G

even carried the Olympic torch. And Japan is expected to use the 2020
Olympic Games to do the same. Australia, the United Kingdom, and others
will also test 5G networks in the coming months and years. [CTIA

merger between T-Mobile and
Sprint](https://newtmobile.com/sparking-the-5g-economy/) is to utilize
their combined assets to become the first nationwide 5G carrier. [Such a
development would push other telecoms to accelerate their 5G rollouts in
order to compete in the marketplace, improving mobile access for
consumers and businesses throughout the country]{.underline}. For their
part,
[AT&T](https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/16/att-were-ok-with-t-mobile-sprint-merger-planning-for-hyper-accurate-5g-gps-and-vr-parks/)
and
[Verizon](https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/03/verizon-pegs-2019-for-mobile-5g-as-sprint-seeks-millimeter-wave-spectrum/)
have both discussed how 5G is creating new opportunities for all the top
US telecoms, with each one implementing a different strategy to develop
and deploy its capabilities. At the same time, the rollout of 5G will
allow telecoms to retire some of the capacity dedicated to 2G and 3G
networks, enabling important cost savings and reinvestment of resources,
as well. [US telecoms may also use the deployment of 5G to capture a
previously untapped and underserved customer base---rural America. In
this effort, public and private sector interests would be
aligned.]{.underline} The [**US Federal Communications Commission** has
identified 5G investment as integral to [closing the digital
divide](https://www.publicintegrity.org/2018/03/02/21479/fcc-says-small-cells-will-close-digital-divide-most-say-they-wont)
that still persists today. Opportunities may therefore emerge for
**public-private partnerships** between telecoms and governments at the
local, state, and **federal levels to roll out 5G coverage**,
particularly to underserved areas]{.underline}. This is important, as
concerns regarding the social impact of technology are growing,
including whether the 4IR will reduce or exacerbate inequality. Such
questions will in large part determine the long-term outlook for the
United States, as explored in our
[America@250](https://www.atkearney.com/web/america250/four-futures)
effort to assess the outlook for the country our to its 250th
anniversary in 2026 and beyond. What will it take to win the 5G race?
[The future center of global technological change will shift as a result
of who wins the 5G race.]{.underline} To be sure, not every country is a
perfect candidate for aggressive 5G investments given variations in
market size, level of technological penetration, the size of the rural
market, and other factors. Additionally, questions remain regarding the
business case for large-scale 5G investments, as the average consumer
[may yet be unwilling to pay a premium for low latency or high-speed
connections](https://www.atkearney.com/documents/291362523/291366299/NextGen--Succeeding+with+the+Digital+Consumer.pdf/ca8639d9-fc3a-8769-7834-f824f500ce27?t=1519665205000).
But [national competitiveness, particularly for the world's major
economies, will increasingly be determined by the level of 4IR
technological adoption and innovation, which in turn will depend on the
quality of national 5G wireless networks]{.underline}. [Winning the 5G
race requires ensuring that coverage is both broad and deep across a

The CEO of Killer50 superstar Darktrace says there is "a shocking

Gustafsson spoke at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) on the
[evolving cyber threat landscape in the context of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine.]{.underline} She was in conversation with Professor Madeline
Carr, Senior RUSI Associate Fellow and Professor of Global Politics and
Cybersecurity at University College London. Commenting on the challenge
of policing both cyber warfare and international cyber crime, Gustafsson
said "[[There remains a]{.mark} [persistent lack of clarity around how
we define]{.mark} an [act of war in the
cyber-sphere]{.mark}."]{.underline} [She [call]{.mark}ed [for the
**creation of a dedicated international cyber task force**]{.mark}**, or
'tech NATO'**, [to deliver **international collaboration** in agreeing
and ratifying]{.mark} a set of [cyber-norms]{.mark} and
accountability.]{.underline} Gustafsson noted that [Russia's invasion of
Ukraine is the first time an active invasion has been supported by the
tactical dismantling of national infrastructure using
cyber-attacks.]{.underline} "The attack on the Viasat satellite that
disabled Ukrainian military communications one hour before the invasion
was a key component of the beginning of this war," argued Gustafsson.
She added: "We have seen UK, US and EU officials jointly attribute this
attack to Russia, an immensely political act. That is unprecedented."
Asked by Prof. Carr whether Darktrace had seen the level of collateral
cyber disruption it expected, Gustafsson shared that Darktrace data
showed a [[global increase in attacks on critical national
infrastructure]{.mark} bodies across its customer base]{.underline},
including a 90 per cent increase in high priority security incidents on
the networks of energy companies in Europe during the week of the
invasion, from February 24. At the domestic level, Gustafsson called for
cooperation and accountability between the public and private sectors as
well as lower tolerance for cyber attacks. She [emphasised the
[importance]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a "[whole of society approach]{.mark}"
to cyber security adding: "There is [a shocking tolerance for cyber
attacks]{.mark}, and that has to change. "Organizations that are
custodians of valuable, private data cannot be allowed to let that data
fall into criminal hands through negligence and face no
consequences]{.underline}." Professor Carr commented: "Issues that we
had thought about speculatively have now become our reality. [We are
facing [war in Europe and]{.mark} there is an e[ssential cyber

Developing Strategies to Counter Hybrid Warfare Meeting the challenge
posed by Russian hybrid warfare will take time and effort. It must also
be developed in conjunction with efforts to strengthen conventional
deterrence. An effective strategy to defend U.S. interests against
hybrid Russian strategies will include, at a minimum, the following.
[[Support for transparency and anticorruption
efforts]{.mark}.]{.underline} Tolerance of corruption greatly
facilitates Russian influence strategies. Some countries in Europe---for
example, many states in the Balkans---suffer from weak anticorruption
legal frameworks and limited political will for change. In other
countries, political will may be strong, but individual privacy concerns
can limit the remit of transparency laws. [**In these areas, [the EU is
an important partner]{.mark} for both the United States and for NATO.
[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should support European
anticorruption efforts wholeheartedly]{.mark}, with appropriate funding
for related State Department and U.S. Agency for International
Development programs.** [Support for internal security reform]{.mark}
and defense institution building [in]{.mark} [targeted states]{.mark}
such as the Balkans and Ukraine]{.underline}. [Although some Balkan
militaries already meet NATO standards of professionalization, others
need additional support]{.underline}. **[[Institution-building]{.mark}
in these countries [needs to]{.mark} be [focus]{.mark}ed [on
weakening]{.mark} any lingering [ties with Russian security
services]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In addition, **[strengthening
capabilities in such countries, as well as in the Baltic states, will
enable greater detection and resistance to covert Russian
operations.]{.underline}** In general, U.S. assistance targeted at
strengthening the rule of law will complicate Moscow's hybrid efforts.15
**[[Strategies to push back against Russian influence
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. More work needs to be done in this
difficult area, but initial research suggests that it may be better to
focus on discrediting sources such as Russia Today and generally raising
awareness of misinformation rather than attempting to fight each and
every story on a tit-for-tat basis. **[Civil society must also be
encouraged to play a larger role in combatting Russian disinformation.
Increasing the flow of positive information will also
help]{.underline}**. In extreme cases, such as wartime, it may be
necessary to temporarily close off access to Russian media outlets.16
[Effective use of U.S. special operations forces in the U.S. European
Command area of operations]{.underline}. U.S. special operations forces
have an important role to play in combating Russian hybrid strategies in
Europe. [Both the mission and operating environment in Europe, however,
is different from that in countries like Iraq and Syria]{.underline}.
This requires some adaptation. For example, **[one challenge is ensuring
that U.S. diplomats are attuned to the needs of U.S. special operations
forces conducting training and other activities in the region.
Conversely, [U.S. forces must]{.mark} also [be fully aware of the
delicate nature of]{.mark} some U.[S. diplomatic activities underway in

operate in support of individual European countries' plans, filling
their gaps and bolstering their programs. Support for European efforts
to combat Russian hybrid warfare. The United States, after all, is not
the first line of defense against most forms of Russian hybrid warfare
in Europe. Instead, the [first line of defense is the EU and European
countries themselves. [The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [can support
specific efforts]{.mark}, such as Finland's Hybrid War Center of
Excellence, Latvia's Strategic Communications Center of Excellence, and
Estonia's Cyber Center of Excellence, while encouraging other best
practices, such as closer public-private partnerships in Europe, to
strengthen Europe's own defenses against cyber attacks.]{.underline}

Our [analysis]{.underline} of the interests and perspectives [of the
major cyber actors]{.underline}, the character of norms and the cycle of
norm emergence, [and]{.underline} the history of [cyber norm development
highlighted two leading principles of a U.S. cyber norm
strategy]{.underline}. First, [it should be catalytic , seeking to
encourage the]{.underline} gradual, sometimes messy [process of
political and social norm emergence rather than trying to put into place
a singular treaty or agreement.]{.underline} [Second, it should be
multistakeholder, working with many public and private actors
simultaneously to advance normative consen - sus on a broad front, and
lending support to norm entrepreneurs]{.underline}. As discussed in
Chapter Three, these principles---and many of the specific elements of
this strategic approach described below--- have characterized elements
of U.S. policy on cyber stability and cyber norms since about 2011. Our
argument is not that this general approach is entirely new, but that
[the emphasis in U.S. efforts should shift away from international
expert negotiation and toward broader political engagement, as well as
toward defining a small handful of normative limits with U.S.
competitors and ensuring greater harmony between U.S. norm-promotion
efforts and other U.S. activities in cyberspace]{.underline}.

The Cyberspace Solarium Commission was tasked with applying social
science insights to American cybersecurity strategy. Organization of the
commission into three task forces on deterrence, active disruption of
adversary attacks through persistent engagement, and norms-based regimes
reflects an important truth. [Norms]{.underline}, or [standards of
socially appropriate
behavior](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2601361?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents),
[are a ubiquitous and unavoidable dimension of global cyber
policy]{.underline}. [Distinguishing a norms-based
approach]{.underline}, however, [carries the risk of suggesting that a
deterrence or persistent engagement strategy could be undertaken without
relying on norms]{.underline}. In fact, [norms are essential to both
strategies and to any other possible cyber strategy]{.underline}. The
only choices facing the United States (or any other actor) are about the
*content* of the norms it promotes, and about how it will convince
others to adopt, interpret, comply with and uphold them. Below, I
introduce several vital but sometimes misunderstood features of how
norms work and discuss their implications for American cybersecurity
strategy. In the past 30 years, international relations scholars have
learned a great deal about norms. First, [norms often generate high
rates of compliance without centralized enforcement; [internet technical
standards](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/protocol-politics) are a key
example]{.underline}. Second, it is a
[mistake](https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/59/2/238/1788767)
for analysts to treat something that violates their own set of norms as
something that is necessarily anti-normative. Individuals and groups
across space and time have held vastly different notions about what
constitutes appropriate behavior. Care should be taken not to conflate
norms in general with a specific set of Western liberal norms that
underpin contemporary rule-based global order. Third, norms are [not
inherently likely to encourage cooperation or discourage
violence](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1354066197003003003).
Some norms (like U.N. Charter Article 51) explicitly authorize violence,
at least under certain conditions. Thus, it is completely consistent
with the standard definition of norms to envision an extremely
conflictual world in which regular, high-consequence cyberattacks are
regarded as appropriate behavior for major powers, states in general or
even various nonstate actors. While such a world would not align with
American interests or values, to the extent actors saw it as legitimate,
it would reflect the influence of norms. Fourth, [norms]{.underline} are
not outcomes that remain static until they suddenly change. Rather, they
[are [ongoing products of social
relations](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/constructing-norms-for-global-cybersecurity/373A149D995A12E824E2FD1E0B5E5675)
that exist not as individual things in isolation but as parts of complex
normative systems]{.underline} that can (and often do) place actors in
difficult positions requiring them to make determinations about
appropriate behavior in light of multiple applicable norms that may be
in conflict. Fifth, [**this means that consensus and completeness [are
not useful
standards](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1354066107087766)
for thinking about** whether **norms** exist or can be useful in a given
issue area.]{.underline} Finally, [norms are important even when
compliance is imperfect. They have a crucial role to play in responding
to violations. The process of [applying and constantly adapting
norms](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/social-practices-of-rule-making-in-world-politics-9780190913113?cc=us&lang=en&)
highlights the fact that the international community relies on norms to
provide a basis for criticizing or justifying behavior]{.underline}. It
is the very existence of such behavioral standards that makes it
possible to
[stigmatize](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/stigma-management-in-international-relations-transgressive-identities-norms-and-order-in-international-society/385D52A5CAC7C515491ED487781E3B4A)
actions that fall outside expectations as with, for example, "rogue
states." In this way, [norms are essential in justifying responses to
norm-violating behavior, whether in the form of criminal indictments,
economic sanctions or even the use of force]{.underline}. Other related
norms tell us how to determine whether a prior norm has been broken, and
how to respond if it has been What does this all mean for American cyber
policy? A great deal. [No single actor, however powerful, can
unilaterally shape norms for cybersecurity]{.underline}. Doing so
requires skillful, consistent engagement in global processes of
rule-making, interpretation and application. [Shaping cyber norms thus
requires "persistent engagement" but of a very different kind than
envisioned by most uses of the term.]{.underline} Specifically, [norms
development requires a coordinated whole-of-government
approach]{.underline} led by the State Department. The United States
must articulate and justify its positions in convincing, legitimate ways
to a broad audience that includes industrial democracies, emerging
economies, foreign and domestic firms, and civil society organizations.
Since these stakeholders have [different
standards](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-theory/article/multistakeholderism-anatomy-of-an-inchoate-global-institution/B69E6361B5965C98CFD400F75AA8DC53)
for what makes an argument convincing, this presents an extremely
challenging diplomatic task.

### 2NC \-\-- Solvency

#### Disambiguating norms solves -- it allows for accountability while avoiding the pitfalls of international agreements

**Lewis 22** \[James Andrew Lewis, Senior Vice President and Director,
Strategic Technologies Program at CSIS, \"Creating Accountability for
Global Cyber Norms,\" Center for Strategic and International Studies,

Blitz

The year 2021 saw all UN member states agree in the Open-Ended Working
Group (OEWG) on a
[framework](https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Final-report-A-AC.290-2021-CRP.2.pdf)
for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, based on norms developed
in the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) in 2015.^1^
The OEWG formalized global agreement on the 2015 norms. This consensus
agreement means that the framework for responsible state behavior is now
politically binding for all member states. Global agreement on the
obligations for responsible state behavior is a substantial step forward
in building international cybersecurity in a rules-based environment.
Unfortunately, international experience since 2015 has shown that
agreement on norms, even when politically binding, is by itself not
enough to ensure their observation or create stability in cyberspace.
This has shifted discussion from what norms are needed to how to build
accountability and what to do when norms are ignored. While the norms
agreed to by all member states will ultimately reinforce international
stability, to make progress, it will be necessary to develop a
collective diplomatic strategy to improve the observation of norms and
increase accountability when they are ignored. A strategy of sustained
engagement and the imposition of consequences is necessary for norms to
have effect. Our assumption is that accountability for malicious cyber
actions can only be strengthened if there are consequences for a state's
decision not to observe norms. If nothing else, a failure to take action
in response to transgressions seems to only encourage opponents. An
immediate task is to define the conditions for collective action. There
has been an initial and informal agreement among like-minded democratic
nations that accountability requires the imposition of consequences for
a failure to observe norms, but several issues must be addressed. These
include agreement on standards for attribution of the source of a
malicious action and agreement on a proportional, lawful, and effective
response. A collective approach is essential if efforts to create
accountability are to succeed, and any response to a cyber incident will
require political heft and sustained engagement. **Applicable Norms and
"Agency"** What norms are in fact ignored? Many of the OEWG norms focus
on protecting critical infrastructure. However, cyberattacks on critical
infrastructure are rare. In contrast, risks of international peace and
stability from other kinds of cyber actions are already increasing. If
the aim is to increase stability, the relevant norms are found in
[paragraphs 13(a) and
(c)](https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Final-report-A-AC.290-2021-CRP.2.pdf),
where states agree to prevent actions that threaten or are harmful to
international peace and security and to not knowingly allow their
territory to be used for wrongful acts. This latter norm is vital, as it
makes clear that responsibility derives from sovereign jurisdiction (or
a failure to exercise it). This makes the assignment of political
responsibility to a state easier and clearer. Equally important, the
foundation for the OEWG norms is the binding agreement by all states to
observe the UN Charter, where states have agreed to refrain from the use
of force or threats to use force against the political independence of
other states and have agreed to respect international law and
fundamental human rights. These OEWG commitments and charter obligations
are routinely ignored by some states that violate other nations'
sovereignty in ways that damage security, stability, and human rights.
[One shortcoming with]{.underline} the UN-agreed [norms]{.underline} [is
their lack of "agency," or the capacity to take action]{.underline}. In
theory, agency falls to the international community acting through the
United Nations Security Council (UNSC), but in fact, this means the
ability to reach agreement in the United Nations on a response to
malicious cyber action is very limited. The United Nations is a
consensus-based organization, with many members who have different and
sometimes competing interests. Creating accountability has always been
difficult for the international community, not just in cyberspace.
Actions must be exceptionally egregious, and powerful states will put
their national interests first. Additionally, states are understandably
reluctant to agree to coercive measures---particularly those involving
force or the threat of force---for cyber incidents where culpability is
deniable, rules are still unclear, and damage (from a strategic
perspective) is usually minimal. The absence of consequences for
individual cyber actions makes it easy to ignore efforts to impose
accountability. *One shortcoming with the UN-agreed norms is their lack
of "agency," or the capacity to take action. In theory, agency falls to
the international community acting through the United Nations Security
Council (UNSC), but in fact, this means the ability to reach agreement
in the United Nations on a response to malicious cyber action is very
limited.* [Creating accountability is complicated for cyber actions,
since almost all such actions stay below the threshold of the use of
force, on which many rules are predicated]{.underline}. The
international community is more likely to respond to the use of force,
but few cyber incidents have had effects that approximate the use of
force. Despite hyperbole, no one has ever died in a cyberattack, there
have been very few incidents of physical destruction, and until 2020,
cybersecurity had never come before the UNSC, making it a lesser issue
in the eyes of many member states not directly involved in cyber
conflict. This is changing as the risks of malicious cyber action have
increased, as dependence on networks has grown, and as a result of
increased great power competition. Even so, there is still some
reluctance to act in response to malicious cyber action. [Diplomatic
practice does offer an alternative approach that provides for
agency]{.underline}. [This alternative is more attainable in the near
term. It requires a group of like-minded nations to first agree on their
responsibility to observe cyber norms in their national
practice]{.underline}. This requires a public commitment at senior
political levels for these nations themselves to be guided by the OEWG
framework for responsible state behavior. On the basis of this
commitment[, the second step is collectively responding to violations of
norms]{.underline}. This collective response has rarely been undertaken
for malicious cyber actions. Changing this is a crucial first step.
Consistent action by a group of states to impose consequences for not
observing agreed norms is essential to creating accountability. An
example might be the Western effort in the 1990s to persuade China not
to sell missiles.^2^ This effort took several years of high-level
engagement and a constant reiteration of the need for responsible states
to observe the norms developed for such transfers (in the Missile
Technology Control Regime). The issue was raised with China at every
level, on every occasion, and during every topic of engagement. A
talking point on proliferation was appended to every senior officials'
statement. Most importantly, it was not just one nation appearing to
complain and suggest; it was done repeatedly and collectively every time
Western leaders engaged with their Chinese counterparts. One of the most
important steps that can be taken to increase observation of the 2021 UN
norms is to make this kind of sustained engagement a routine expectation
for state behavior rather than a sporadic objection when unspoken
expectations for respecting sovereignty and law are flouted. [Raising
specific instances of a failure to observe norms with the state
responsible and asking for explanation and cessation is an essential
first step]{.underline}. However, such efforts will be more effective
when accompanied by persuasive evidence (and adequacy will be discussed
later) and when carried out by many nations. [This can be done in both
private and public engagement]{.underline}. In the proliferation case,
it was persuasive to share with China and others the most senior levels
of intelligence (such as satellite imagery) that established
responsibility. [For cyber actions, there will be objections to such
sharing on the grounds that this will inform opponents of U.S.
capabilities, but the detailed indictments made by the Department of
Justice---often accompanied by pictures of the individual government
agent---show such sharing can be done.]{.underline} This is different
from "name-and-shame," a useless strategy involving a public statement
made safely in capital and without any follow-up action. These
statements have no political weight. What is needed is a direct
engagement with the leaders of culpable states and the credible threat
of a punitive response. The key to a new approach is a consistent,
collective, and direct approach at senior levels to object to a state's
failure to observe norms accepted by all responsible states. Every time
ministers meet with a counterpart, they must raise the issue of
malicious cyber action, using points developed in common with their
partners and providing specifics of the act. The actions that have come
closest to this have only occurred with the joint condemnations of
[China](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners-attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/)
and
[Russia](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-and-us-call-out-russia-for-solarwinds-compromise)
and the statements [by President
Biden](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/06/16/remarks-by-president-biden-in-press-conference-4/)
and the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy,
[Josep
Borrel](https://www.euronews.com/2021/09/24/eu-s-borrell-threatens-sanctions-on-russia-over-malicious-cyber-activities).
But if such statements are to be more than one-offs, filed away and
ignored, they must be repeated by all other G7 nations and by other EU
member states. Consistent and direct iteration on the need to observe
norms must become standard diplomatic practice for like-minded states.
[A comprehensive strategy to create accountability would define and
articulate possible responses to reinforce an integrated diplomatic
campaign. In developing a collective diplomatic strategy linked to
potential consequences, the issues of political attribution, the
development of a menu of response actions consistent with international
law and agreed norms, and proportionality in any response come to the
fore as determinative issues.]{.underline}

2\. Crisis indicators: International law and cyber security Three
stand-out indicators suggest a crisis in this area of law. First, [the
domain of cyber security appears resistant to codification of the
applicable rules in a comprehensive multilateral binding
treaty.]{.underline}
[^25^](https://www-cambridge-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/core/journals/leiden-journal-of-international-law/article/from-cyber-norms-to-cyber-rules-reengaging-states-as-lawmakers/63A45029B685C11BBD9512AC0459FAE5#fn25)
[This is not for want of trying by the leading international
stakeholders.]{.underline} In 1996[, France put forward the earliest
proposal]{.underline} with the lofty title *Charter for International
Cooperation on the Internet*.
[^26^](https://www-cambridge-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/core/journals/leiden-journal-of-international-law/article/from-cyber-norms-to-cyber-rules-reengaging-states-as-lawmakers/63A45029B685C11BBD9512AC0459FAE5#fn26)
[Later, a Sino-Russian initiative resulted in two proposals]{.underline}
for a *Code of Conduct for Information Security*, submitted to the UN
General Assembly in 2011 and 2015, respectively.
[^27^](https://www-cambridge-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/core/journals/leiden-journal-of-international-law/article/from-cyber-norms-to-cyber-rules-reengaging-states-as-lawmakers/63A45029B685C11BBD9512AC0459FAE5#fn27)
However, [none of these proposals was met with much enthusiasm by other
states]{.underline}
[[^28^]{.underline}](https://www-cambridge-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/core/journals/leiden-journal-of-international-law/article/from-cyber-norms-to-cyber-rules-reengaging-states-as-lawmakers/63A45029B685C11BBD9512AC0459FAE5#fn28)
[and scholars describe the prospects of an 'omnibus' treaty being
adopted in the near future as slim to negligible]{.underline}.

This is no doubt partly because, whatever the subject, the 'very word
"treaty" may conjure up the fearsome formalities of diplomacy', with a
chilling effect on states' willingness to engage in this form of
law-making.
[^30^](https://www-cambridge-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/core/journals/leiden-journal-of-international-law/article/from-cyber-norms-to-cyber-rules-reengaging-states-as-lawmakers/63A45029B685C11BBD9512AC0459FAE5#fn30)
Yet, with respect to cyber security, this aversion appears to be
particularly pronounced. Second, [states have shown extreme reluctance
to contribute to the development of cyber-specific customary
international rules]{.underline}. In addition to state practice in this
area being inevitably shrouded in secrecy,
[^31^](https://www-cambridge-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/core/journals/leiden-journal-of-international-law/article/from-cyber-norms-to-cyber-rules-reengaging-states-as-lawmakers/63A45029B685C11BBD9512AC0459FAE5#fn31)
[states have been reluctant to offer clear expressions of *opinio juris*

At times, this approach may be understandable, as it is the consequence
of domestic political gridlock or a deliberate waiting strategy.

On other occasions, it may rather be due to the persistent
'cybersecurity knowledge gap'; in other words, the striking lack of
understanding of cybersecurity permeating governments around the world.

On the whole, [this reluctance adds to the pervasive ambiguity as far as
the specific applicability of international law is concerned. This trend
is visible even in the most recent development]{.underline}s. A
representative example of another missed opportunity to steer the
development of cyber custom is provided by the recent US *Law of War
Manual* adopted in July 2015 and updated in December 2016.

The [world runs on [open source]{.mark}, which [serves as]{.mark} the
[**foundation** for globally interconnected digital

both the [private and public sectors depend on the maintenance of open

engagement has centered around security. Earlier this year, GitHub
attended the [[White House meeting on software
security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/13/readout-of-white-house-meeting-on-software-security/) where
participants discussed the unique value and security challenges of OSS.
While securing OSS is an important concern, full stack federal OSS
policy requires dialogue between policymakers, practitioners, and wonks.
To this end, GitHub was proud to attend the June 8 roundtable
discussion, [From Procurement to Policy: Towards OSS
Infrastructure](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/from-procurement-to-policy-towards-oss-infrastructure-tickets-318956335987),
in Washington, D.C.]{.underline}

The event kicked off with a bold question posed by Harvard Business

his [Brookings policy

Nagle proposed actionable steps the public sector
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} take [to [**cultivate a thriving OSS

### 2NC \-\-- Solves Cybersecurity

#### Open-sourced software solves cybersecurity

**Lin 22** - \[Sz Lin, (works for Moxa in the Software Development
Center) 2022, \"Manage Vulnerabilities in ICS Open Source Software,\"
Global Cybersecurity Alliance,
<https://gca.isa.org/blog/manage-vulnerabilities-in-ics-open-source-software>\]
//MLee

[[Open source software]{.mark} (OSS)]{.underline} is frequently
[integrated into industrial control systems (ICS) and critical
infrastructure]{.underline} as business owners [[pursue greater
**interoperability, portability**, and
**interchangeability**]{.mark}.]{.underline} While tapping into the
benefits of open source software, [cybersecurity considerations are
imperative, since [availability and reliability is paramount]{.mark} for
industrial control systems]{.underline}. Ensuring high-quality code in
open source software to avoid an increased cyber risk to the ICS becomes
a pivotal challenge. Vulnerability management of open source software
should be considered and evaluated through the lifecycle of software
development, starting as early as possible---to reduce cost and effort
in the maintenance phase and to enhance the cybersecurity management
that helps avoid system downtime.

Open Source Software in Industrial Control Systems

OSS is ubiquitous nowadays. According to a report by Synopsys
Cybersecurity Research Center, OSS is widely adopted across various
industries, including the Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity, and
internet and mobile apps.1 Microsoft, once the largest proprietary
software advocate, is now the single largest contributor to open source
projects in the world.2 With tech giants such as Facebook, Google,
Amazon, and Apple all involved in various open source projects
nowadays---contributing to, as well as consuming, millions of lines of
open source code daily---the prevalence of open source is evident in
today's technology development.

Besides consumer-grade hardware and software, OSS also proliferates in
industrial control systems and critical infrastructure. Linux, the open
source operating system (OS) based on Linux kernel, is now a mainstream
OS in the industrial space.

For instance, take operational technology (OT) systems. From industrial
PCs and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in the control network at
the field level, to the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
and engineering servers in the supervisory network at the mid-level, to
application servers in the management network at the top level, a
majority of these industrial control devices run Linux OS with open
source applications.

[**[OSS provides great interoperability, portability, and
interchangeability]{.mark}** to ICS, as numerous devices may all come
from different vendors in the supply chain with heterogeneous software
packages. [The "open" nature]{.mark} of OSS [allows]{.mark} ICS
[providers and industrial device suppliers to integrate systems with
ease]{.mark} and flexibility [while effectively enhancing]{.mark} the
[efficiency of software development]{.mark} without building things up
from scratch.]{.underline}

The Cybersecurity Requirement for ICS

However, the "open" nature of OSS also raises cybersecurity concerns in
ICS. After all, [the vulnerabilities or cybersecurity issues in the ICS
and critical infrastructure may result in far-reaching impacts such as a
massive power outage and/or operations failures in the civil
infrastructure systems across telecoms, the water supply, wastewater
treatment, and railways, to a certain extent. **[To tackle]{.mark}** the
[cybersecurity t]{.mark}hreat to ICS, worldwide governments,3 including
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) under the
[U.S. F]{.mark}ederal [G]{.mark}overnment, have [strongly
recommended]{.mark} that ICS owners comply with certain
[standards]{.mark} for industrial cybersecurity, [such as]{.mark} the
[ISA/IEC 62443 series]{.mark} [of standards]{.mark}.]{.underline}

ISA/IEC 62443-4-1, one of the ISA/IEC 62443 standards, defines a [secure
development lifecycle for the purpose of developing and maintaining
secure products used in industrial automation and control
systems]{.underline}. To meet the requirement of security, reliability,
and sustainability for an ICS, it is critical to manage the great amount
of OSS running in the ICS during the software development lifecycle
(SDLC), as part of the product life cycle specified by the ISA/IEC
62443-4-1 standard.

## Space 

### 1NC \-\-- SpaceX

#### SpaceX bottom up approach solves -- bringing the public and private sectors together solves without relying on international actors. 

Brian **Downey**, 9-2-20**20**, \"MSP Security Threats,\" Connect Wise,
<https://www.connectwise.com/blog/cybersecurity/improving-msp-cybersecurity-a-look-at-spacex>

If you've been following the news lately, you know that SpaceX---the
space exploration company founded by Elon Musk nearly 20 years ago---is
making a lot of headway in their mission to get to Mars. It's not a
matter of IF SpaceX will make human travel into space possible, but
WHEN.

[There's a lot to be learned from the way SpaceX approaches their
mission, specifically as it relates to cybersecurity.]{.underline}

[It may seem like a stretch to link something like space travel to
cybersecurity, but a strong connection can be made based on the way
SpaceX runs its business.]{.underline}

Let's explore how managed service providers (MSPs) can learn from
SpaceX.

[Bottoms up approach to solving issues]{.underline}

Oftentimes[, companies who are venturing into new territory have a
tendancy to choose to take what they have and improve it versus stepping
back and understanding the problem and being open to starting from
scratch. When you think about SpaceX, they could have taken rocket ship
components from the 1950s and 60s and thought about what needed to be
added to it as had been the approach for the past 50 years. Instead,
SpaceX took a ground-up approach and started fresh]{.underline}.

[As a result of that ground-up approach, SpaceX streamlined the way they
solved problems]{.underline}. [A very good example of this is when you
look at the views from the inside of the SpaceX Dragon
cabin]{.underline}. The difference is obvious when you look at the
variety of gauges and screens in the legacy NASA shuttle versus the four
clean looking screens in the Dragon cockpit. [The SpaceX team focused on
what information was needed, leveraged various pieces of data
traditionally shown independently, and understood how they could display
that data within their consoles to deliver useful messages to
astronauts. T]{.underline}his changed the way astronauts solved
problems. Where in the past, astronauts needed to take multiple pieces
of independent data and execute calculations to answer their questions,
today, those components work with and talk to each other to give
operators the exact information they need in a more holistic way.

[In other words, in old shuttles, every single piece of information
possible was given to an operator. In SpaceX, only the information that
is needed right now is provided]{.underline}.

As an MSP putting this in a cybersecurity lens, it can be very tempting
to approach new security problems by taking your existing
infrastructure, understanding any gaps, and bolting a few more tools on
to try to close them. This approach leaves you with a management
approach akin to trying to make sense of all the data points in the
legacy shuttle. Instead, you should look at the problems you need to
solve and identify the full tech stack and offerings to meet the needs
of people today. The goal with cybersecurity is to understand and
predict what happens when certain actions are orchestrated together.

Teams joining together

[The way that SpaceX has brought the public and private sectors together
is a groundbreaking facet that cannot be ignored. For the most part,
private companies work independently and the public sector operates in a
completely different world. SpaceX is bridging the two together by
functioning as a private company working alongside public sector
employees.]{.underline}

When you think about MSPs and their clients, much of the work they do is
in isolation of one another. A law firm, for example, looks at an MSP as
having responsibility for all things technological, while an MSP has no
interest in doing what the law firm does. With cybersecurity, this needs
to change. MSPs and clients need to see security as a joint approach.

Going back to the law firm, an MSP can do everything on their end to
protect their client, but if an employee in that law firm is going to
bad websites and using weak passwords, they can create cybersecurity
risks that an MSP can't counteract. It's not just about an MSP educating
their client, but also about the client feeling empowered and believing
that cybersecurity is important, not an inconvenience.

[If NASA didn't truly believe that Elon Musk and his team could
successfully enter the space industry, they would have never worked with
SpaceX to solve hard problems along the way. The mutual belief about the
importance of SpaceX's work was greater than the perceived
inconveniences to get there, therefore resulting in a successful joint
partnership]{.underline}.

Working towards a bigger mission

The mission to get to Mars is a pretty overwhelming, boil-the-ocean type
of task, right? That's how a lot of people feel about cybersecurity.

The key is to break everything down into smaller pieces that will
eventually help you reach your larger goal[. SpaceX isn't just building
a rocket and attempting to get to Mars on the first try. They are
running small tests little by little that will help drive them towards
overall success]{.underline}. Their most recent flight didn't actually
go somewhere or do an activity that hadn't been done before. But it
proved that they could do what has been done before with new equipment,
a new approach, and a new team that appears to be capable of their
larger goal, and that makes us all feel confident that they will get to
that larger goal.

Smaller, more attainable goals are key for any MSP getting into
cybersecurity. Focus on the first step and then the second step and so
on versus zoning in on how far you are from your end destination.

Additionally, with SpaceX and with cybersecurity, this story is larger
than any of us. There's a social advantage to playing a role here.

[SpaceX is trying to help the human race survive after Earth is no
longer here. With cybersecurity, MSPs are protecting the people and
institutions within our countries and society.]{.underline}

Everyone wants to leave a legacy, and contributing to something that
will potentially make our society a better place is a significant way to
do so. MSPs need to realize they aren't just identifying and stopping
faceless threats, they are working to stop efforts to destabilize our
society, to impact political processes and subvert global crime
organizations that are involved in much more than ransomware or selling
data. The work MSPs do to protect their clients is truly substantial at
a global level.

In conclusion

[SpaceX appears to be the future of space travel and will disrupt the
way we think about and approach space exploration in the future, the
same way cybersecurity is the future for MSPs. It's the next
frontier.]{.underline} While it may be challenging and overwhelming to
think about, it's enormously beneficial and kind of a necessity for us
to think about right now.

Anytime there is a revolutionary shift, it creates an opportunity for
businesses to decide how to work. [SpaceX is changing everything about
the way we think about space travel]{.underline}. Cybersecurity is
disrupting and changing everything about the way we deliver services to
IT clients. MSPs need to embrace that disruption and capitalize on it.

### 1NC \-\-- Space Force 

#### The USSF solves satellite cyber security

**Johnson 22** - \[Kimberly Johnson, (Writer covering aviation and
defense issues, including assignments in Iraq and Afghanistan with
Marine Corps and Army infantry units) 5-26-2022, \"To Infinity and
Beyond,\" FLYING,
[https://www.flyingmag.com/to-infinity-and-beyond/\]//MLee](https://www.flyingmag.com/to-infinity-and-beyond/%5d//MLee)

[The U.S. Space Force (USSF)---the nation's newest military service
branch and the first created in a generation---stands ready to engage in
a new era of national defense where commercial space and military
interests collide.]{.underline}

[Pushing military capabilities "to infinity and be-yond" isn't exactly
new. The U.S. military began space research following World War II and
prior to the formation of the Department of the Air Force. Nearly four
decades later, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) unified efforts by establishing
the Air Force Space Command in 1982. That mission later expanded into
cyberspace as well as providing space-based communication and
navigational support]{.underline} for U.S. forces deployed in Iraq and
Afghanistan.

In December 2019, the command was authorized to stand alone when
Congress gave the green light to the creation of the new service through
the National Defense Authorization Act. When it was signed into law, [it
marked the reality that space creates a new frontier when it comes to
national security. The need for a new service focused on defense in
space comes as adversaries, such as China, increasingly modernize their
military capabilities. U.S. military leadership keeps a wary eye on
China's growing inventory of hypersonic weapons, anti-satellite systems
and cyber and electronic warfare capabilities]{.underline}. "While
[America is still the dominant military power on the planet today, we
are being more effectively challenged militarily than at
any---any---other time in our history]{.underline}," Secretary of the
Air Force Frank Kendall said at the Air Space Cyber Conference in
September 2021.

That challenge is no longer strictly terrestrial. In an era of
commercial space tourism and satellite dependence, space has gone from a
benign environment to a contested one, according to one top Space Force
official.

"We don't have decades. [We're in a race with some serious adversaries
that mean to deny us those advantages that we get in space," says Lt.
General B. Chance Saltzman, USSF deputy chief of space
operations]{.underline}. [Russia and China are pursuing and using
kinetic and non-kinetic space weapons, "some operating on the ground,
pointing up. And some that are designed to work from orbit," Saltzman
says. Some of those systems include directed energy, jammers, and
satellite kill vehicles, he says.]{.underline}

In addition, [there are currently nearly 30,000 tracked space debris
objects in orbit, prompting the monitoring of more than 1,500 that have
the potential for collision at any given time, he adds. "Space has truly
become a congested and contested environment," Saltzman
says]{.underline}.

Built for Speed

The [Department of the Air Force's Space Force, which currently has
nearly 7,000 uniform-wearing guardians, is a coequal branch of service
alongside the USAF. It consists of a simplified structure of three field
com-mands: Space Operations Command (SpOC), Space Systems Command (SSC)
and Space Training and Readiness Command (STARCOM).]{.underline}

[With a streamlined headcount of personnel expected to grow to 8,400 in
the coming fiscal year, standing up the new service has been an exercise
in building some-thing new while also culling layers of bureaucracy,
says General John W. "Jay" Raymond, USSF chief of space
operations]{.underline}. "[We wanted to have a purpose-built
organization, built for speed. Something that could go fast. Something
where we can push decision making down to the lowest level, and
something that we could get layers of bureaucracy out of the
way,"]{.underline} Raymond says.

The [USSF's focus on speed means senior leadership infield commands will
have more authority and resource sat their disposal. "SSC needs to
re-energize its approach to seeing, understanding, and rapidly
developing while fielding new capabilities to keep us ahead of threats
that we see from China and others]{.underline}," says USSF Vice Chief of
Space Operations General David D. Thompson.

Picking up the pace means that the [Space Force will also need to expand
partnerships when it comes to acquisition]{.underline}s, Thompson says.

#### Updating satellites solves critical infrastructure. 

Rebecca **Heilweil**, 7-29-20**21**, \"For hackers, space is the final
frontier,\" Vox,
<https://www.vox.com/recode/22598437/spacex-hackers-cyberattack-space-force>

Our [increased reliance on this tech makes the threat of hacking
especially worrisome. A hacker could try to access a satellite by
targeting a company's ground systems, and once inside, the attacker
could manipulate the communications or controls, download unwanted
software, or even tell the satellite to change its course]{.underline},
according to Iain Boyd, the director of the University of Colorado
Boulder's Center for National Security Initiatives.

"It's the same kind of thing where people are getting into your computer
system and behaving badly," Boyd told Recode. He added that [hackers
might also attempt to overwhelm a satellite with false signals or
impersonate a satellite's communication --- a process called spoofing
--- to confuse vehicles on Earth's surface.]{.underline}

[These cyberattacks on space systems have been disruptive, but their
impact could be catastrophic. For instance, in 2014, US officials blamed
China for a cyberattack that forced the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) to cut off public access to imagery data from a
satellite network used for weather forecasting.]{.underline} [Russia has
reportedly used GPS spoofing to confuse ships about their actual
locations. And in the future, a worst-case scenario could involve a
hacker tricking a satellite into crashing into other space
infrastructure]{.underline}, according to William Akoto, an
international politics professor at Fordham University, who studies
cyber conflict.

"You can't just walk down to the server room and apply a patch to
something that's in orbit," explained Matthew Scholl, who leads the
computer security division of the Information Technology Laboratory at
the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST).

[To address the impending threat of cyberattacks on space systems, the
US military earlier this year transferred more than 2,000 cybersecurity
experts to the newly formed Space Force.]{.underline} The Air Force,
meanwhile, has begun hosting competitions encouraging hackers to break
into satellites, with the hope of learning more about potential
vulnerabilities. But [cybersecurity experts warn that the private space
industry hasn't been transparent about how it's managing security
threats.]{.underline}

"From a commercial standpoint, we have to hope that they're doing
something," said Falco, the Johns Hopkins professor. "But [most
commercial companies working on satellite systems have given zero
details about anything that they have regarding the security of their
space systems."]{.underline}

Some of these companies are currently hiring cybersecurity
professionals. Blue Origin, for instance, has been looking for an
information system security officer to find vulnerabilities in the
company's systems, while SpaceX is searching for an information security
assurance analyst to investigate the physical and cybersecurity of the
company's supply chain.

None of the companies Recode contacted --- Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin,
OneWeb, and SpaceX --- responded to a request for comment about the
state of their cybersecurity.

But as commercial space companies try to staff up their security teams,
the federal government is also stepping in to help.

[Last year, then-President Donald Trump signed an executive order
recommending principles for cybersecurity and space systems, encouraging
private companies to take precautions like boosting protections for
control systems in their rockets and satellites and deploying antivirus
software to protect their ground stations. NIST has developed
cybersecurity resources for commercial space operations, including
satellites]{.underline}.

[In June, Reps. Ted Lieu and Ken Calvert proposed legislation that would
classify space as critical infrastructure to boost collaboration between
private space companies and the government on cybersecurity
matters]{.underline}. The Federal Aviation Administration also helped
create the Space Information Sharing Analysis Center (Space ISAC), a
collaboration that coordinates with companies across the space industry
to share information about potential threats and attacks to their
cybersecurity.

"[Infrastructure that is distributed globally means that there's a very
broad attack surface]{.underline}," Erin Miller, Space ISAC's executive
director, told Recode. "[We need to be building in and designing
cybersecurity capabilities into every single one of our space
systems]{.underline}."

For now, that means that ensuring national security and addressing the
cybersecurity challenges of the emerging space industry are one and the
same. After all, the growing number of attacks against all sorts of
private companies, whether they're oil pipelines or meat distributors,
makes it clear that [when firms don't protect themselves from hackers,
the American public can feel the consequences]{.underline}. [As more of
the tech that powers our everyday lives heads to space, so should the
country's increased focus on cybersecurity]{.underline}

//MLee

No war is a one-sided affair. There is no sound to one hand clapping.
[Russia\'s assault on Ukraine is an unambiguously bad thing. But it
**didn\'t happen in a vacuum**. In order to solve the problem, we have
to first understand the context in which it occurred, and the **part
that the** **U.S.** played in its happening.]{.underline} \[[The
**U.S.\] can attain** **that end** with two simple moves: **declare**
that Ukraine will **not be admitted into NATO**; and **remove its
offensive nuclear missiles** from Russia\'s borders.]{.underline} The
[Big Bang in U.S.-Russian relations was the breakup of the Soviet Union
in 1991. Then-U.S. president George H.W. Bush and his Secretary of
State, James Baker, promised Mikhail Gorbachev that if he agreed to the
unification of Germany, NATO would not expand eastward, toward Russia,
\"not one inch.\"]{.underline} That [promise was broken almost
immediately when, in 1999, Bill Clinton helped usher Poland, Hungary,
and the Czech Republic into NATO]{.underline}. Russia considered this
move [not just a betrayal, but an act of aggression]{.underline}. First,
Poland is an implacable enemy of Russia, and has been for centuries. And
NATO had just finished bombing Russian ally Yugoslavia out of existence.
The \"slav\" in Yugoslavia signifies the same ethnicity as the Slavs who
are the Russian people. [It is lost on the average American that
Russians are spooked by Western aggression]{.underline}. Napoleon
invaded Russia in 1812 and burned Moscow to the ground. That\'s what
Tchaikovsky\'s 1812 Overture, with its church bells ringing and cannons
booming, is about. The German invasion in the First World War caused the
government of the Tsar to fall to the Bolsheviks. That gave birth to
communism as a state-based system and the animus for the Cold War which
dominated the second half of the Twentieth Century. Before World War I
was even settled, [the Western victors invaded Russia to try to snuff
out its new government before it was stable.]{.underline} That was the
infamous White Counter-Revolution, led by the U.S., the U.K., Japan, and
Italy. The German invasion in World War II caused the death of
27,000,000 Russians, 90 times U.S. losses in the War. Over 70,000
villages, 1,500 towns, and 9,000 bridges were destroyed. The already
primitive national transportation network was reduced to rubble and
agricultural production was decimated. Russians remember these things,
though they are barely known in the West. [The perception of
aggressiveness in NATO moving eastward was hardly the Russians\'
alone]{.underline}. Bill Bradley, Paul Nitze, Sam Nunn, Robert McNamara,
and more than 30 other foreign policy heavyweights wrote to Clinton that
such expansion was both provocative and unnecessary, given the absence
of a military threat. George Kennan, the [pre-eminent U.S. strategist of
the post-World War II era, declared that, \"NATO expansion will prove
the greatest U.S. foreign policy blunder of the twentieth
century.\"]{.underline} That is a pretty stern prediction, coming from
the man who conceived of the Cold War policy of Containment and who, in
1980, wrote, \"The Vietnam War was the most disastrous of all of
America\'s undertakings over the whole two hundred years of its
history.\" It didn\'t matter. The U.S. had just won the Cold War. It was
on a roll, convinced of its imperial inevitability, strategic
infallibility, and military invulnerability. Vapid phrases masqueraded
as deep ideas, phrases like \"a new world order,\" \"the end of
history\" and \"the indispensable nation.\" They were tossed around as
rationalizations for the use of force against any nation that stood in
the way of U.S. pursuit of global hegemony. Think, Iraq, and
Afghanistan. [**The U.S. promise** to not move NATO eastward was
**broken again**, in 2004, when, during the George W. Bush
administration, NATO admitted Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to
membership. All three nations adjoin Russia, placing NATO forces on
Russia\'s borders. NATO also admitted Romania and Bulgaria in the same
induction batch.]{.underline} Poland, Hungary, and Romania participate
in NATO\'s \"nuclear preparedness posture\" which means hosting
offensive nuclear missiles aimed at Russia. These can hit major Russian
cities in as little as 10 minutes. The best way to understand the
provocativeness of this move to the Russians is the Cuban Missile
Crisis. [In 1962, the Soviet Union began placing offensive nuclear
missiles in Cuba, 90 miles off the coast of Florida. It was in response
to the **U.S.** having **installed similar missiles in
Turkey**]{.underline}. The Cuban missiles would be able to hit
Washington D.C. in 30 minutes. [The U.S. became apoplectic, in fact,
hysterical.]{.underline} There was no defense against the missiles. U.S.
military forces were put on \"DEFCON 2\" alert, the highest state of
preparedness short of actual war. It was the only time during the entire
45 years of the Cold War they were placed at such an elevated state of
readiness. Robert McNamara, then Secretary of Defense, later wrote of
going out onto the balcony of the White House, looking up at the stars,
and crying. It occurred to him that this would be the last Saturday he
would ever see. That\'s how perilous the Crisis was. It was only John
Kennedy\'s deft handling of the situation that defused the Crisis. Part
of the resolution was that the U.S. agreed to remove its missiles from
Turkey. It was an implicit acknowledgement on the part of the U.S. of
just how provocative such forward-based offensive nuclear systems are.
They are no less provocative today. [In 2014, the **U.S. helped carry
out** a **coup** d\'état **against** the democratically-elected,
Russian-leaning Ukrainian government of **Viktor Yanukovych**. It
installed in its place a crypto-fascist, Western-leaning government
headed by Arseniy Yatsenyuk.]{.underline} U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Victoria Nuland was [recorded organizing the coup. The recordings
were made public by Russian intelligence in February 2014. When told by
her associate, Geoffrey Pyatt, that the EU would not support a coup,
Nuland famously declared, \"Fuck the EU.\"]{.underline} Since the 2014
coup, the U.S. has shipped more than \$2.5 billion in weapons to the new
Ukrainian government. It has seen to it that [Ukraine has not honored
the Minsk I and II treaties that it signed in 2014 and 2015. Those
treaties were designed to protect the autonomy of Russian-speaking
dissidents in eastern Ukraine.]{.underline} In early February, [the
government of Ukraine began shelling Donbass]{.underline}, that eastern
region of the country with a majority Russian-ethnic population. This
has been done with the [implicit blessing of the U.S., Ukraine\'s
strategic sponsor]{.underline} Between 2002 and 2020, the U.S. withdrew
from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the Intermediate Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty, and the Open Skies Treaty. All were designed to reduce
tensions with Russia by ensuring verifiable enforcement of strategic
nuclear weapons systems. Without the Treaties, nuclear uncertainty, and,
therefore, the risks of mis-step and war, are greatly heightened. So,
where does this leave us? Harvard\'s Stephen Walt, hardly a lightweight
or a leftist dove, wrote two weeks ago, \"Whatever your views on NATO
enlargement might be, there is overwhelming evidence that Russian
leaders were alarmed by it from the start and expressed their concerns
repeatedly. Moscow grew increasingly opposed ...as NATO crept ever
eastward.\" Nobody can pretend the West did not know what the stakes
were or what was coming. No meaningful security guarantees were offered.
Indeed, [in December, 2021,]{.underline} [Vladimir Putin stated publicly
that there was no further back that Russia could go]{.underline}. [If
the west would not provide meaningful security guarantees, Russia would
solve the problem itself through \"military-technical
measures.\"]{.underline} The current invasion is what he was referring
to. Nobody can pretend the West did not know what the stakes were or
what was coming. No meaningful security guarantees were offered. Again,
[Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine is unambiguously bad. But as we search
for a solution to the crisis, the key consideration is that while
Ukraine is existential for the Russians---a matter of life and
death---it is not a vital national security interest to the
U.S.]{.underline} This is revealed in President Biden\'s repeated
assurances that [no U.S. forces will be committed to
Ukraine]{.underline}. [That is the key to the solution]{.underline}. If
the [**U.S**. is sincerely interested in a peaceful resolution of the
crisis]{.underline}---and for argument\'s sake, let\'s assume that it
is---[it can attain that end with two simple moves: declare that Ukraine
will not be admitted into NATO; and remove its **offensive nuclear
missiles** from Russia\'s borders.]{.underline} Since Ukraine is not a
matter of strategic interest to the U.S., [this would come at little
cost to the U.S. but will yield vastly disproportional gains to the
situation by facilitating immediate de-escalation.]{.underline} Both
[the U.S.]{.underline} and NATO have [stated informally that Ukraine
will not be admitted anyway]{.underline}, so nothing, save, perhaps a
little face, is lost. It would allow Russia to withdraw with something
to be said for its efforts. As for the second plank of the
solution---[**withdrawal of U.S.** nuclear missiles from countries
adjoining Russia---the U**.S. understands better than any nation** on
earth the value of having offensive nuclear missiles removed from its
borders. It knows]{.underline}, from first-hand experience, [better than
any nation in the world, how to defuse this crisis.]{.underline} This is
the concept of \"strategic empathy:\" understanding your adversary\'s
interests and motivations, not to give in to them, but to better attain
your own ends. As Walt, Kennan, and other analysts have said, Russia
feels aggressed upon, threatened, and out of peaceful options. If the
U.S.\'s ends are peace, the means are at hand to achieve it, and with no
loss of strategic position. If the [U.S.\'s interests are not
peace]{.underline}, that will be revealed equally as clearly, equally as
quickly. Yes, there will be necessary negotiations about withdrawal,
reparations, and other such wind-downs, but those pale next to the
threat of unintended escalation to what could very easily end up as
nuclear war. The stakes are huge. Simple, workable solutions are at
hand. The costs are small. The alternatives are unfathomable. [If the
**U.S.** wants **peace,** it **can have it tomorrow**.]{.underline}

#### Plan text: The United States Federal Government should ratify the Convention on Biological Diversity and take action to complete and sign the Biosafety Protocol

#### The CBD and BSP work to protect biodiversity and increase information sharing between countries for mutual benefit of the environment and the field of biotechnology

"[Representatives from **170 countries** are currently negotiating
international provisions governing the shipment and use of products from
biotechnology. These provisions, officially known as the \"Biosafety
Protocol,\" are intended to provide uniform international requirements
for ensuring the safe transport and use of these products. The Protocol
could offer a framework to guide countries that currently lack national
regulatory systems for products of biotechnology.]{.underline} If the
Protocol is not carefully crafted, however, it could seriously impede
international trade, product development, technology transfer, and
scientific research. Potential benefits could also be significantly
offset by huge costs, uncertainty, and delays. Protocol development is
proceeding rapidly; negotiations will be completed in February 1999.

Background: The Biosafety Protocol (BSP) is an outgrowth of the
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), a multilateral treaty for
protecting biodiversity. [The CBD\'s sound and commendable goals are to:
**Conserve biodiversity** and provide for its **sustainable use**, and
promote the **fair and equitable sharing of benefits** derived from the
**genetic resources** inherent in biodiversity.]{.underline}

[A Biosafety Working Group (**BSWG**) was established under the CBD to
draft a Protocol dealing with the \" transfer, handling and use of
\'living modified organisms\' (LMOs) derived from biotechnology that may
have an adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of
biodiversity.\" The BSWG is negotiating aspects of the BSP, including
Protocol scope, advanced informed agreements for shipments of LMOs,
**risk assessment parameters, liability, labeling, confidentiality**,
status of non-Parties to the treaty, and the relationship of the BSP to
other international agreements]{.underline}. The CBD website
(www.biodiv.org) contains detailed information on the CBD and BSP.

Protocol Scope: [The BSWG is currently considering which materials,
genetic modification techniques and activities the BSP will cover. Many
Parties favor expanding the scope beyond organisms that may have an
adverse effect on biodiversity to include most, and perhaps all, LMOs.
Others want to expand the scope even further to include products derived
from or produced by LMOs. If this approach is accepted, the **BSP**
would cover bulk commodity grains, raw and processed **foods** and food
ingredients, animal feed, and **pharmaceuticals**. Covered products of
biotechnology will likely include most genetically modified organisms,
including modified cells and seeds, and may also include: products
derived from or produced by genetically modified organisms/cells/seeds
or vectors and plasmids used to create genetically modified
organisms/cells/seeds.]{.underline} There are many methods for
\"altering the genetic material in a way that does not occur
naturally,\" some of which have been used for decades. The methods of
genetic modification covered by the BSP, which are still under debate,
will include recombinant DNA techniques and direct injection of nucleic
acids into cells and may also include cell fusion and other genetic
modification techniques. Therefore, LMOs genetically modified using any
of these techniques and products derived from those LMOs may be
captured.

Activities covered by the BSP will include transboundary movement and
deliberate releases, and may also include handling, transfer and use of
genetically modified organisms, including contained uses. Key
Requirement: According to current language in the negotiating text,
[shipments of products captured by the provisions would require an
explicit advanced informed agreement (AIA) between the exporting and
importing country before the product can be shipped. The exporter would
provide a written notification of shipment, accompanied by an extensive
risk assessment, to the importer.]{.underline} The time frame for
accepting or rejecting the shipment is unclear, but could be as long as
6 months or even undefined."

"Desired Outcomes Biodiversity is a global resource of tremendous value
to all of humankind. [The CBD provides an important opportunity for
**nations** to **work together** on an issue vitally important to us and
future generations. To that end, we support a BSP that furthers the
goals of the CBD: The **conservation and sustainable use of
biodiversity** and equitable **sharing** of the **benefits of
biotechnology**]{.underline}. To contribute to these goals, the BSP
must: Be based on sound scientific principles. Take into account the
actual environmental risks and the benefits of biotechnology, especially
its role in facilitating biodiversity conservation. Focus on the
transboundary movement of LMOs that may threaten biodiversity. Not
unnecessarily restrict the transboundary movement of LMOs that pose no
threat to biodiversity, thus increasing costs and delays without
compensatory increases in environmental protection. [Be consistent with
existing international obligations to **protect** the
**environment**]{.underline}. [Encourage technology transfer and
information sharing so all countries can benefit from advances in
**medical, agricultural and environmental biotechnology**, while, at the
same time, allowing for the protection of confidential information and
intellectual property.]{.underline} Not divert resources from the
protection of biodiversity to the development and administration of a
regulatory system requiring case-by-case review of low-risk products.
[Be flexible so that any country can respond rapidly and appropriately
to favorable developments in the new and evolving field of
biotechnology."]{.underline}

"THE PROPOSED BIOSAFETY PROTOCOL: KEY ISSUES The Parties to the
Convention on Biological Diversity intended for the Biosafety Protocol
to govern the transboundary movement of Living Modified Organisms (LMOs)
that may have an adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use
of biological diversity. Jakarta Decision II/5, which established the
negotiating parameters, provides that the Protocol: Not exceed the scope
of the Convention; Not override or duplicate any other international
legal instrument; Not unduly hinder access to and transfer of
technology, and Be efficient, effective and minimize unnecessary
negative impacts on biotechnology research and development. To serve the
goals of the Convention and meet the conditions specified by Decision
II/5, the Protocol must provide for the conservation and sustainable use
of biological diversity, while at the same time allowing for the
development and use of valuable new products. It must also be consistent
with other international agreements and not cause unwarranted
disruptions in the transboundary movement and trade of essential
materials. To meet these objectives we recommend that the Biosafety
Protocol be built on the following key positions: The scope of the
Protocol must govern only those LMOs and intended uses that may have a
significant adverse effect on biodiversity. Extending the scope of the
Protocol cover LMOs and intended uses that, based on scientific
principles, will not have significant adverse effects on biodiversity
would impede access to agricultural, medical and other beneficial
products without a compensatory increase in biodiversity protection.
LMOs and intended uses that realistically will not have adverse effects
on biodiversity should not be included in the scope of the Protocol.
This will allow resources to be focused more effectively. Appropriate
exclusions include, at a minimum, LMOs that have been reviewed and
accepted for commercial or research use by the importing country; LMOs
destined for contained use or transport; commodities approved for
commercialization, and pharmaceuticals. The Advanced Informed Agreement
(AIA) procedures should be applied only to those LMOs and intended uses
that may realistically have a significant adverse effect on
biodiversity. A \"Notice of First Shipment\" should be the primary
mechanism to inform countries of the proposed shipment of an LMO. An AIA
provision that requires written notification and consent for all LMOs
will be extremely costly, demanding and burdensome for governments to
administer, especially as the number of shipments covered by the
Protocol increases. Moreover, if an intricate, lengthy and repetitive
AIA process is applied to all LMOs, access to food, fiber and health
care products will be impeded as will the development of new products.
The Protocol must be consistent with international trade rules. If the
scope of the Protocol is unnecessarily broad and the AIA procedure is
excessively burdensome, the Protocol could have serious negative impacts
on the trade. As such, the Protocol\'s scope and AIA provisions must be
limited to those LMOs and intended uses that may realistically have a
significant adverse effect on biodiversity. The decision to approve or
deny shipment of an LMO covered by the Protocol must be based on sound
science regarding real or reasonably anticipated effects on
biodiversity. Speculative, non-significant adverse effects on
biodiversity must not be used to reject products. Discrimination of
products based on their production techniques must also be avoided. The
Protocol must provide for the protection of confidential business
information and other intellectual property. The Protocol must contain
clear and appropriate procedures for designating and protecting
confidential information and intellectual property shared in conjunction
with the notification provisions of the Protocol. Procedures for
resolving disputes over confidentiality claims regarding protected and
privileged information must also be defined in the Protocol. [In the
**absence** of protection afforded by such **procedures**, companies and
institutions will be reluctant to engage in commercial **trade**,
international product **development** or exchange of **research**
materials involving LMOs covered by the Protocol.]{.underline} The
Protocol should not create an international system of liability.
Existing national and regional legal systems should be relied upon to
determine what triggers legal liability for harm to biodiversity, the
nature and extent of harm that can be compensated, and the procedural
system to obtain relief from liable parties."

**UNEP 10** (UNEP Convention on Biological Diversity, The conservation
of biological diversity, The sustainable use of the components of
biological diversity, The fair and equitable sharing of the benefits
arising out of the utilization of genetic resources, "United Nations

"The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is an international
legally-binding treaty with three main goals: [conservation of
biodiversity; sustainable use of biodiversity; and the fair and
equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic
resources. Its overall objective is to encourage actions which will lead
to a **sustainable future**.]{.underline} The conservation of
biodiversity is a common concern of humankind. [The CBD covers
biodiversity at **all levels**: Ecosystems, species and genetic
resources. It also covers **biotechnology** through the Cartagena
Protocol on Biosafety. In fact, it covers all possible domains that are
directly or indirectly **related to biodiversity** and its role in
development, ranging from science, politics and education to
agriculture, business, culture and much more.]{.underline} The governing
body of the CBD is the Conference of the Parties (COP). This ultimate
authority of all governments (or Parties) that have ratified the treaty
meets every two years to review progress, set priorities and commit to
work plans. In 2010, Parties to the CBD adopted the Strategic Plan for
Biodiversity 2011--2020, [a ten-year framework for action by all
countries and stakeholders to **safeguard biodiversity** and the
benefits it provides to people.]{.underline} The Secretariat of the
Convention on Biological Diversity (SCBD) is based in Montreal, Canada.
Its main function is to assist governments in the implementation of the
CBD and its programmes of work, to organize meetings, draft documents,
and coordinate with other international organizations and collect and
spread information. The Executive Secretary is the head of the
Secretariat."

"The ultimate conservation challenge for all the countries remains
halting biodiversity loss. This review however reveals that developing
and developed countries and transition economies are at different stages
of implementing the different requirements of the CBD. [The countries
that have progressed most on the programmes of work of the CBD also have
developed economies and strong capacity to **share information**,
**coordinate** stakeholder **actions**, and apply **economic incentive**
measures.]{.underline} Developing countries and transition economies
however are in the process of implementing measures on capacity
development, awareness-raising, engaging key sectors and stakeholders,
and mainstreaming of biodiversity targets. Additional efforts are
required by developing countries and transition economies on knowledge
and information-sharing mechanisms, engaging indigenous communities and
developing sustainable financing mechanisms for conservation. The key
challenges to the national implementation of the CBD identified in this
research can be major explanations of failure to achieve the 2010
Biodiversity Targets. National challenges are complexed by multiple
interactions with political, societal, legal, economic policy, and
financial factors. The underlying, persisting problem is that limited
capacity in developing countries and transition economies undermines
conservation initiatives. This study is also of the view that the CBD
objectives and targets cover an enormous range of tasks and agendas for
the Parties, which can create confusion and divert attention from issues
most pertinent to biodiversity conservation at the national level. This
is particularly relevant for issues on access and benefit sharing,
indigenous rights, traditional knowledge, and technology transfer, where
gaps still remain within national legislations and the CBD. Despite many
challenges, institutions, stakeholders, and the Parties have
demonstrated certain best practices and developed networks of inquiry
for CBD implementation. This study proposes the following
recommendations for inclusion in national strategies to address the
challenges and achieve the Convention's objectives: • Institutional and
capacity: Implementing the NCSA priorities and reviewing existing
regulatory processes, including creating incentive schemes for skilled
practitioners to engage in the biodiversity conservation field. •
Knowledge and accessible information: National agencies should develop
communication strategies and make information available online through
user-friendly and contemporary websites that provide key audiences the
ability to take relevant action. • Economic policy and financial
resources: Developing and marketing quality biodiversity projects
through a resource mobilisation strategy. Market-based instruments such
as payments for ecosystem services and fair trading schemes should be
designed, piloted and where possible, replicated to stimulate
sustainable financing schemes. • Cooperation and stakeholder
involvement: Consulting key stakeholders and the community to better
understand their problems and opportunities, and support mutual actions
on conservation. Developing and formalising partnership initiatives with
the scientific community will also actively promote joint actions. •
Mainstreaming and integration of biodiversity: Engaging national
planners, statisticians and finance staff for setting national targets
and allocating direct budgetary support for CBD implementation. Lessons
learnt from mainstreaming initiatives in successful countries are
useful, which can be documented and disseminated to other Parties. It is
also important to point out that national conservation measures should
be supported by multiple sectors and secure high level political
support. Political, economical, and [**legislative sectors** are more
likely to show interest in **CBD implementation** and use it **as a
tool** for **managing biodiversity** when they know the Convention
processes and perceive it as a benefit.]{.underline} Modest investments
in capacity building and training, and engaging different sectors in
setting priorities would have a significant pay-off."

## Funding 

**Military funding for brain health projects**

**Macaulay 21** \[Thomas; 10/5/21; City University London Master's
Degree ; "US Army funds 'sleeping cap' that could modulate brain health
of soldiers," <https://thenextweb.com/news/us-army-funding>
sleeping-cap-that-modulates-soldiers-brain-health\]

After [experimenting with exoskeletons, performance-enhancing drugs, and
AR goggles to develop super soldiers, the US military has taken a punt
on a brain-modulating skullcap. The army has issued funding for a
wearable device that analyzes how the brain disposes of waste during
sleep.]{.underline} The system will be [developed by researchers at Rice
University, Houston Methodist Hospital, and Baylor College of Medicine.
Ultimately, the team wants to create a headset that can treat sleep
disorders in real-time.]{.underline} But first, they [aim to track and
adjust the flow of cerebrospinal fluid as it flushes waste out of the
brain]{.underline}. Currently, this is [done with magnetic resonance
imaging equipment]{.underline}. Paul Cherukuri, executive director of
Rice's Institute of Biosciences and Bioengineering, said the Pentagon
wants to create a more compact alternative: Since an MRI can't be easily
transported, the Department of Defense asked if we can [design a small,
portable cap that can measure and modulate the brain health of
warfighters during sleep to enhance their performance.]{.underline}
Developing this prototype will require us to start with off-the-shelf
devices and learn from them in parallel with building our own sensor
technology and algorithms at Rice. The final device could merge multiple
streams of data through machine-learning software to give clinicians a
real-time view of the brain-clearing in action. The team aims to have
preliminary results of their project within a year. [The project could
support new treatments of brain disease, but it also evokes terrifying
visions of unsleeping super soldiers.]{.underline}

### 1NC \-\-- Private Sector

#### Funding through startups solve and uses fewer government resources

**Chen 21** \[Jenny ; 8/21/21; Harvard Medicine and MIT Graduate ;
"Fundraising in Bioprinting: 3DHEALS Perspective -- Guide,"
<https://3dheals.com/fundraising-in-bioprinting-3dheals-perspective-guide/>\]

[Where to find funding for early-stage bioprinting
startups?]{.underline}

[While a frothy market may not be good news to investors, investing in
the right startup even at a higher valuation is still the winning
move.]{.underline}

[On the other hand, to the entrepreneurs in bioprinting, biotechnology,
and life sciences, the timing could not be better. Nonetheless, for
scientists turned into first-time entrepreneurs, it is still hard to
figure out where to find early-stage funding, and how to fundraise in
general.]{.underline}

[Early 2021, I have summarized a number of notable companies in the
space of healthcare 3D printing, ranging from new startups ("newborns")
to new public offerings (SPAC or IPO, "unicorns"). It is often
insightful to observe companies at different stages throughout their
life cycle, find parallel storylines in the public market, and figure
out the best strategies to fundraise or to invest. Often, reading the S1
of similar pre-IPO companies can be helpful in either polishing up a
startup's pitch deck or for investors interested in early-stage
startups.]{.underline}

[In general, there are 7 major funding sources. In the order of
increasing difficulty and larger amount, they are:]{.underline}

[Grants and prizes (Free money!)]{.underline}

[Friends and family/angel investors]{.underline}

[Investment banker/Business loans]{.underline}

[Crowdfunding (Regulation CF)]{.underline}

[Accelerator/Incubator]{.underline}

[Corporate VC]{.underline}

[Venture Capital]{.underline}

[Grants and Prizes -- Free \$\$\$]{.underline}

[Grants and prizes are excellent non-diluting funding, but are they
really free?]{.underline}

[There is no free lunch, and that still stays true.]{.underline}

[The other prized possession of the founders is Time, and applying and
waiting for this nondiluting funding takes a lot of time especially when
the grant/prize amount is small relative to the fundraising goal.
Typically these make a lot of sense for seed-stage biotech companies,
which need 1-5 million USD. There are many additional benefits in
getting grants. To save more time, some companies may consider hiring a
specialist dedicated to writing grants. They are not just for non-profit
organizations.]{.underline}

[However, for series A, the amount increases to double-digit millions in
USD, and anything beyond will be into the triple-digit territory. Grants
and prizes opportunities that would satisfy these dollar amounts are
increasingly scarce as the amount increases.]{.underline}

[I also don't know of any company that has ever successfully exited due
to free money alone. More importantly, since this is a business, you
would want market validation, and that's why raising institutional
funding will be important beyond just the dollar amount.]{.underline}

[Additionally, government grants (at least in the United States) are not
given without caveat. There are occasions when IP generated under
government grants is subject to certain rules and restrictions. Weighing
the cost and benefit with your patent lawyer will be a wise move before
your grant strategies.]{.underline}

[Friends, Family, Angel Round]{.underline}

[Angels play a significant role in funding early-stage startups,
especially for first-time entrepreneurs with no track record of building
businesses or even telling a good story around his/her company. "The
best available estimates are that about 300,000 people have made an
angel investment in the last two years. Many more people could become
angels based on a net worth of \$1 million or more, the potential number
of angel investors is 4 million."\[Ref 4\] Some angel investors invest
in the founder's character/talent through their personal interactions,
some invest in the company's story, and others invest for impact. If a
startup can curate a good group of angel investors, sometimes, this can
be equivalent to having a great group of advisors, marketing, future
fundraising channels, in addition to the checks they write. While a
typical angel check size (5K-100K) is insufficient for a seed round for
bioprinting startups, angel groups can often provide amounts in
millions.]{.underline}

[While friends-and-family round sounds warm and cozy, I would advise
caution, that is, if you want to keep those same friends and family. The
bottom line is that if those friends and family members are also angel
investors in other companies, chances are they are more knowledgeable in
terms of the risks involved. That is, 80% of all startups will fail in
five years.]{.underline}

[With the newly instituted Regulation CF, many platforms now provide
crowdfunding opportunities that allow non-accredited investors to invest
as low as 100 dollars. This method can be particularly helpful for a
seed round or bridge round when data is too scarce for institutional
investors. We will expand on these platforms and the regulations around
them in a later blog post.]{.underline}

[Institutional Investors]{.underline}

[But since biotechnology companies often need significantly larger check
sizes and longer runways to achieve the holy grail, such as bioprinting
organs, raising institutional money is almost inevitable. But what if
you don't know of any institutional investors?]{.underline}

[There are generally three categories where you can find
them:]{.underline}

[Accelerator/Incubators]{.underline}

[Corporate VC]{.underline}

[VC]{.underline}

[One way to figure out who you should approach for fundraising is
through reverse engineering. Some of the investor information is held
private, but much of this information is public information. You can
find this information from many different data aggregators such as
Crunchbase or Pitchbook (expensive!).]{.underline}

[For example, if you are a bioink startup and are looking for VCs, you
could find existing similar biomaterials or bioink companies in the
market (large or small), and then figure who their investors are. Large
chemical companies often have a VC arm because they need innovations to
stay competitive and are always looking out for potential acquisition
deals. Therefore, by association, you can generate a few dozens of
potential firms that you can reach out to that could be interested in
investing in your company. A word of caution, however, is that VCs may
have a conflict of interest in investing in too many startups that are
direct competitors to one another.]{.underline}

[How to get your foot into the door?]{.underline}

["Networking. Networking. Networking."]{.underline}

[This would be a learning process, and you are likely to make many
mistakes. Your time is as valuable (if not more) as the investors'. The
law of "Give and Take" is always in play in this most capitalistic
process of startup fundraising. Always ask what kind of value any kind
of interactions or transactions have returned to you or the investors.
(No hard feelings if you have not responded to my emails
lately...)]{.underline}

[It is a tough job, but isn't this adventure the exact reason you have
abandoned your professorship in the ivory tower?]{.underline}

[How to participate in Pitch3D?]{.underline}

[Many moons ago, we have published a few blogs focusing on how to pitch
in front of the investors, and they are still worth a read
here:]{.underline}

[Fundraising in Healthcare 3D Printing, Part I: So, You Want to
Pitch?]{.underline}

[Fundraising in Healthcare 3D Printing, Part II: Are you Printing
Money?]{.underline}

[Try to pitch to investors carrying lower stakes, for example, friends
and family, Pitch3D, or any friendly angels (like myself). If you make a
mistake with them, you can get their feedback to polish up your
presentations for higher-stake investors. For those who are truly
inexperienced, I would highly recommend reputable accelerators or
incubators such as YCombinator, IndieBio, Techstars, among others. You
lose a small percentage of equity for years of company-building
experience, investor network, the reputation that would add
valuation.]{.underline}

[Funding international growth]{.underline} According to Brinter, many
researchers still use traditional drug discovery and disease modelling
methods, when its proprietary 3D bioprinter could help scale the entire
process. [As a result, using its newly-raised funding, the company aims
to make its technology as accessible as possible, and bring bioprinting
within reach for all U.S. or European clinical firms, hospitals and
universities.]{.underline} At present, Brinter's clientele includes
companies like Nanoform, as well as researchers at VTT, the University
of Glasgow, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, University of Oulu
and University of Helsinki. [In one particularly promising project at
the University of Eastern Finland, the firm's technology is currently
being used to 3D print neural matter for future brain disease modelling
applications. "I am extremely excited to continue our 3D brain printing
project with Brinter,"]{.underline} explained Jari Koistinaho, Professor
of Regenerative Medicine at the University of Eastern Finland. "[3D
bioprinting will soon provide us with fine-tuned human mini-brains and
brain prosthetics, thereby deepening our understanding of the human mind
and our ability to combat serious brain disorders." For its part,
Innovestor has also identified "accelerated technological, material and
methodological" advances within the bioprinting industry, and it now
anticipates that Brinter's technology will supplement this trend, making
scientific R&D up to ten times faster and helping to usher in the age of
bioprinted heart/kidney transplants.]{.underline} "We are very excited
to be a part of Brinter's journey," concluded Wilhelm Lindholm, CEO of
Innovestor. ["Brinter is an exciting addition to our portfolio as the
company's competitive advantages of multi-material printing
capabilities, modularity, and scalability combined with their own
easy-to-use software application were very convincing." "COMPANIES LIKE
BRINTER ARE PAVING THE WAY FOR 3D BIOPRINTING, REVOLUTIONIZING THE
FUTURE OF MEDICINE TO THE POINT WHERE A CUSTOMIZED HEART OR KIDNEY CAN
BE MADE FOR A TRANSPLANT PATIENT."]{.underline} Advances in bioprinted
organs [While transplantable bioprinted organs remain years away from
reality, recent advances in the technology may have shortened this wait
considerably.]{.underline} 3D Systems' continued interest in bioprinting
will no doubt hasten its development, and the firm reported "tremendous
progress" within its dedicated Print to Perfusion program earlier this
year. As part of a strategic refocus announced by the company in 2020[,
it has also sought to build on its core healthcare and industrial
segments, and acquired Additive Works and bioprinting firm Allevi during
May 2021, with this in mind.]{.underline} Similarly, manufacturers such
as UpNano are increasingly entering the bioprinting sector, and the
company has now launched its own NanoOne Bio system. Released in May
2021, the firm's machine is reportedly capable of constructing 3D
tissues out of living cells, resulting in viable meso-to-nanoscale sized
structures. [In more experimental developments, the National Science
Foundation (NSF) has awarded Allegro 3D nearly \$1 million to fund the
R&D of its novel high-throughput bioprinting platform.]{.underline}
[Using the capital, the firm aims to create a machine that's capable of
rapidly producing in-vitro therapeutic and biomedical testing
models.]{.underline}

The [U.S. biopharmaceutical ecosystem has propelled the U.S. to global
leadership in medical development. Here we look at the impact of venture
capital and small startup companies]{.underline} in this process from
2000-2017.

The vast [majority of biopharmaceutical companies are small startups
working to turn the latest scientific discoveries into viable treatments
for a whole host of diseases and medical conditions.]{.underline}
Thousands of these companies -- which are found in almost every state in
the U.S. -- [operate without profits or even revenues, yet are able to
devote substantial resources toward their research and development
efforts.]{.underline} This [would not be possible without the venture
capital investors who provide the necessary backing for biopharma

development time frame for biopharmaceuticals. Indeed, it would be
virtually [impossible for biopharma startups to ever get off the ground
without the investment of time]{.underline}, resources and guidance that
their venture partners provide. The corporate venture capital arms of
established biopharmaceutical companies -- particularly PhRMA member
companies -- provide a considerable share of these inputs.

[New medicines developed by startups not only advance science and human
health but also bring jobs and economic growth to their
communities.]{.underline} While relatively small in numbers compared to
large firms, jobs in startup biopharma companies are knowledge-intensive
and high-impact, [generating a positive ripple effect throughout the
regional economy]{.underline}. In this way, venture-backed enterprises
deliver the dual benefits of scientific advancement and economic growth

[Finland-based 3D bioprinting start-up Brinter has revealed that it has
received €1.2 million worth of investment. Raised via a seed funding
round led by early-stage VC firm Innovestor, the capital is set to be
used as a means of expanding the company's operations, allowing it to
more easily address the U.S. and European medical markets with its
modular 3D bioprinter, which it says could have future organ fabrication
applications.]{.underline} "Bioprinting can rapidly unlock the
opportunities behind long-running but unrealised science and research,
and plays a key role in pushing the frontier of medical science," said
Tomi Kalpio, CEO of Brinter. "This will result in an improved quality of
life for patients through the expansion of more personalised treatment
and the ongoing development of bioprinted 'spare parts' that can save
lives." "WE ARE [EXCITED TO HAVE THE BACKING OF INNOVESTOR, WHO CAN HELP
US ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES AND SCALE
IN NEW GEOGRAPHIES."]{.underline} Brinter's bioprinting technology Based
in the Finnish city of Turku, and spun-off from the 3D printing bureau
3DTech Ltd, Brinter develops bioprinting systems, modules and inks for
medical, research and cosmetics clients. The firm's offering revolves
around its aptly-named 'Brinter 1,' which is capable of depositing
layers of cell-laden hydrogels into oncological models as well as
cancerous and cartilage microtissues. In practise, [Brinter clients are
able to use the company's software to turn MRI, X-ray or CT scanning
data into CAD models, before printing them into viable soft tissues for
use within drug evaluations, in a way that could help accelerate the
translation of new medicines into clinics and bring an end to the use of
animal testing. Priced at €24,900, Brinter's machines are far from
cheap, but they are also uniquely modular in that users can acquire and
add different printheads to access a variety of modalities on a single
platform]{.underline}. The company's Pneuma Tool, for instance, enables
the dispensing of low-to-medium viscosity bio-inks, while its premium
Visco Heated Tool comes with material temperature-regulating
functionality.

spread of, and, in some cases, eliminating the threat of the world's
many devastating infectious diseases.]{.underline}

The human immune system is incredibly powerful and versatile, working
continuously to keep a variety of invaders from causing infection and
disease. From bacteria, to viruses, to parasites, the immune system
recognizes invading threats and triggers a response in the body to
contain and combat invaders. [And although the immune system is
incredibly robust, it is not invincible which is why vaccines are needed
to help support the body's defenses.]{.underline}

[Vaccines present a number of unique challenges that make them
particularly complicated to research]{.underline}, [including
scientific, clinical and logistical hurdles throughout the development

"incredible growth in the real estate pipeline to meet the demand of
biopharma companies that are choosing to launch and scale across
Massachusetts."

Vaccine Safety

[Vaccines undergo a rigorous research and development process in order
to ensure safety and efficacy]{.underline}, [and continue to be
monitored long after U.S.]{.underline} Food and Drug Administration
([FDA) approval]{.underline}. [Manufacturers and health authorities
coordinate to ensure strict manufacturing and delivery schemes, in order

current U.S. vaccine supply is the safest in history]{.underline}, due
in part to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's)
long-standing vaccine safety program, which closely and constantly
monitors the safety of vaccines. One important element of the program,
the Immunization Safety Office, monitors possible vaccine side effects
and works with public health stakeholders to assess possible connections
to vaccines. For example, while some have had concerns that autism
spectrum disorder might be linked to the vaccines children receive,
studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and
developing autism spectrum disorder.

[There are several notable success stories in prevention of infectious
diseases in the U.S. and worldwide]{.underline}. Smallpox at one point
was one of the deadliest diseases in existence. But as a result of
American immunization efforts, the last natural outbreak occurred in
1949. And across the globe due to aggressive vaccination programs
naturally-occurring smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980. Though
many diseases remain threats around the world, vaccination requirements
in the U.S. have led to the elimination of once highly contagious
infections impacting children, including polio in 1994, measles in 2000
and rubella in 2004.

[In the United States today, 16 diseases are now
preventable]{.underline} as a result of childhood vaccines, and routine
immunization of U.S. children born between 1994-2018 has prevented more
than 419 million illnesses.

[Today, biopharmaceutical companies are working with stakeholders across
the research and development (R&D) ecosystem to develop new ways of
preventing and treating illnesses with innovative vaccines. According to
a new report, there are currently 258 vaccines in development for the
treatment or prevention of disease.]{.underline}

Among the vaccines in development are:

[108 vaccines for cancer,]{.underline} including a therapeutic vaccine

### 2NC \-\-- Squo solves gene editing 

#### **We've already banned gene editing.** 

**Kaiser 19** \[Jocelyn; 6/4/19; Princeton University degrees in
chemical engineering; "Update: House spending panel restoes U.S. ban on
gene-edited babies,"
https://www.science.org/content/article/update-house-spending-panel-restores-us-ban-gene-edited-babies\]

\*Update, 4 June, 1:25 p.m.: [By voice vote, the full Appropriations
Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives today restored language
to a 2020 spending bill that bars the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) from considering requests to approve any clinical trial \"in which
a human embryo]{.underline} is intentionally [created or modified to
include a heritable genetic modification.\"]{.underline} Late last
month, an appropriations subcommittee had removed the rider, which has
been part of the spending bill that funds FDA for the past 4 years.
Today, Democrats who lead the spending panel said they had removed the
rider because they wanted to spur [a fuller debate on how the U.S.
government should regulate the genetic modification of human sperm,
eggs, or embryos]{.underline}. [In particular, they said that although
they support a ban on using gene-editing tools such as CRISPR to modify
babies, they were concerned that the FDA rider]{.underline} might also
hinder the development of potentially helpful therapies, such as
modifying a cell\'s mitochondria to prevent heritable diseases. Several
Democrats said they were reluctantly supporting the request from
Republicans to restore the rider, and lawmakers from both parties
suggested congressional health committees that shape agency policies
need to address the issue comprehensively, rather than have it debated
annually during the appropriations process.

Here is our previous story from 24 May:

[A Democrat-led spending panel in the U.S. House of Representatives has
dropped a provision that banned embryo editing with the intention of
creating a baby. The draft bill is still moving through the legislative
process]{.underline}, however, and Republicans will likely push to
restore the language.

T[he ban was first added to the law that funded the U.S. government in
2016.]{.underline} It bars the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from
considering any clinical trial application \"in which a human embryo is
intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic
modification.\" Although a different \"rider\" bars the National
Institutes of Health from funding human germline editing---or the
genetic modification of sperm, eggs, or embryos---such work is
permissible with private funding. However, researchers would need FDA
approval for a clinical trial.

[A 2020 draft spending bill approved on 23 May by the House
appropriations subcommittee that funds FDA does not contain the rider,
as CQ first reported yesterday.]{.underline} A Democratic aide speaking
on background told ScienceInsider: \"The provision was dropped because
it was inserted in private 3 years ago and has never been subject to
public debate. We believe this provision [could limit important
scientific research and, if Congress chooses to prohibit such research,
that should be done in the light of day.\"]{.underline}

[The rider has served as a de facto U.S. ban on germline editing to
create a baby, which is explicitly barred in some countries. Concerns
about such experiments intensified in November 2018, when a Chinese
scientist announced he had used the CRISPR gene-editing tool to modify
the genome of twin baby girls in an effort to make them resistant to
HIV]{.underline}. That work, which did not go through proper regulatory
approvals in [China and has been widely condemned as unethical, has
drawn calls from some scientists and bioethicists for a global
moratorium on human embryo editing.]{.underline}

But some scientific advocacy groups [dislike the FDA bill language
because it means Congress made the decision, not scientific and
regulatory experts. Sean Tipton, chief advocacy, policy, and development
officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine who is based
in Washington, D.C., says the provision was \"an antiscience rider.\"
Removing it \"allows the FDA to do its job.\"]{.underline}

[Bioethicist Hank Greely of Stanford University in Palo Alto,
California, agrees the language was \"bad policy.\" He adds, \"This is a
good change, but it raises new challenges, for Congress and for
society.\"]{.underline}

Dropping the provision frees FDA to consider allowing a less
controversial approach that combines genetic material from a mother, a
father, and an egg donor to prevent an embryo from inheriting a
mother\'s mitochondrial disease, Greely notes. That \"three-parent
embryo\" treatment is being tested in clinical trials in the United
Kingdom and has been endorsed by U.S. experts. \"It is much farther
along ... and U.S. clinical trials should not be under a blanket ban,\"
Greely says.

The top Republican on the House appropriations agriculture subcommittee,
Representative Jeff Fortenberry (R--NE), opposed removing the embryo
editing ban. \"Starting in 2016, the subcommittee acted to prevent an
emerging science that would allow for the permanent modification of an
individual\'s genetics and those of future offspring. [This is a
prohibition that is accepted by nearly every nation in the world due to
the unknown risks,\" Fortenberry said.]{.underline}

[The rider could still be added to the bill when it is taken up by the
full House Appropriations Committee or when it reaches the House floor.
The Senate has not yet crafted its version of the spending
bill.]{.underline}

Correction, 4 June 2019, 2:52 p.m.: As the result of an editor\'s error,
an update to this story incorrectly reported that the 4 June voice vote
to restore the rider was unanimous. One Democrat, Representative Debbie
Wasserman Schultz (FL), voted against restoring the rider.

[of]{.mark} the [impacts]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a wide array of [emergent
tech]{.mark}nologies [by]{.mark} **[hegemonic]{.mark} [actors]{.mark}**
or aspirants]{.underline} (For a preliminary list, see Jervis 1978, Levy

1998, Murray and Millett 1998, Tannenwald 2008, Clarke and Knake 2010,
Vogel 2012, Waltz and Sagan 2012, Carpenter 2013). [However, [there has
been little examination of what the]{.mark} [adoption of
biotechn]{.mark}ology [by]{.mark} **the [leading military
powers]{.mark}** has meant or [is likely to mean]{.mark}. The United
States Office of Technology Assessment defines biotechnology as "any
technique that uses a living organism, or parts of organisms, to make or
modify products, to improve plants or animals, or to develop
microorganisms for specific uses."]{.underline} 320 D. Malet [Other
definitions include material patterned after living organisms but not
necessarily using them as components (biomimetics).]{.underline} The
conventional wisdom on biotechnology has held that [[coming]{.mark}
[decades]{.mark} [will]{.mark} [see]{.mark} **Western nations**
increasingly vulnerable to ever-[more sophisticated biological weapons
**attacks** by non-state actors and rogue states]{.mark}. As recombinant
genetic [**technology proliferates**, a greater number of actors will
possess genetic engineering capabilities that will enhance the
**lethality** and **durability** of]{.mark} their [bio]{.mark}logical
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Proponents of this perspective
note that the [overwhelming **[tech]{.mark}nological
[advantage]{.mark}** in conventional forces enjoyed by the United States
[creates]{.mark} the [incentive for competitors to develop]{.mark}
effective asymmetric responses, and that the affordability,
accessibility, and relatively easy preparation of [bio]{.mark}logical
[weapons]{.mark} make them a [likely]{.mark} means of doing
so.]{.underline} In this view, the [superior conventional capabilities
of the [US military not only **fail to deter the proliferation of
bio**]{.mark}**logical [weapons]{.mark}**[, but **encourage their
development**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Western states will face an
increasing number of biologically armed opponents, and will remain on
the defensive. The priority for military biotech research is therefore
the development of [protective]{.mark} equipment and vaccines,
antibiotics and antivirals]{.underline} (Department of Defense 1998).
However[, this scenario requires the presumption **[that]{.mark}
[military]{.mark} [applications of biotechnology]{.mark}** will simply
be a secular progression from the bacteriological warfare that has
existed throughout history.]{.underline} Even when [analysts have
factored in the vast possibilities of genetic engineering]{.underline},
it has usually only been [to the extent that they can breed deadlier
pathogens, and that [the growing availability of technology means that
it may be used by a **broader spectrum of
actors**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Conventional wisdom therefore
predicts an unstable future for the international system, a Hobbesian
world in which the weakest have power to kill the strongest. [Rather
than rogue states and non-state terrorists, it is the most powerful and
resource-laden actors in the international system that will enjoy the
advantages of "biological warfare" in the twenty-first century as they
continuously integrate emergent biotechnologies into their military and
national defense infrastructures and extend their
dominance.]{.underline} This process will closely resemble the
[Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA)]{.underline} that occurred during
the last 30 years of the twentieth century as the [United States adapted
its forces to exploit advances in new information
technologies]{.underline}. The RMA, first described by the Soviet
military intelligence in the 1970s and then witnessed by the world
during the unexpectedly uneven 1991 Gulf War, occurred because the
[United States employed its competitive advantage in integrated computer
systems. Rather than a single transformative device, like the atomic
bomb, the steady accretion of advanced technologies augmenting existing
equipment came to inform doctrine and strategies. The term asymmetric
warfare is meant to describe efforts by weaker participants in military
confrontations to frustrate the advantages of the stronger power by
guerilla tactics or other unconventional methods not envisioned in force
planning]{.underline} (Mack 1975). However, [[high technology also
offers **asymmetric advantages** to **the best-equipped actors**, and
American military planners sought to use the advances of the RMA to
field forces that no state competitor could match.]{.mark} Their goals
included "dominant maneuver" capability on the battlefield in bringing
dispersed resources to bear against targets, "precision engagement"
capability delivered by smart weapons, and **"[full dimension force
protection]{.mark}**["]{.mark} against all anticipated
threats]{.underline} (Rizwan 2000). [The ultimate expression of this
vision would be a fighter comparable to a "Jedi knight" from the Star
Wars films: [a **super-empowered solider**]{.mark}, dressed in a
protective stealth cloak and **[commanding]{.mark}** an Defence Studies
321 **[armed companion drone, able to perform solo missions and to
transmit data back to headquarters]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Hundley and
Gritton 1994). Coincidentally or not, this is precisely how Darth Maul
was depicted in 1999's The Phantom Menace. [Military planners likewise
foresee similar advantages conferred by developments across the various
biotech fields. In coming decades, biotechnology is forecast to bring
advances such as "rugged computers" made from biological components that
will provide situational awareness to individual soldiers on the
battlefield, camouflaged materials and lightweight armor incorporating
the properties of living organisms, and ingested biological markers to
distinguish friendlies, which would be of particular use in
counterinsurgency]{.underline} (Purdue University 2001). From the
perspective of those involved in force planning, [[the anticipated
**future is not one of vulnerability but
unassailability.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

recent auction of the C-band for 5G, which raised nearly \$81 billion in
revenue, was followed by]{.underline} objections from the Federal
Aviation Administration ([FAA]{.underline}). This is not the first time
in recent memory that spectrum battles have erupted. There is an ongoing
dispute over the repurposing of spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band between the
Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC). Many more examples of bureaucratic infighting and
dysfunction have littered the spectrum landscape. Sadly, [these disputes
are not just Beltway parlor games; they have real consequences for
America\'s economy. American technology companies face an uncertain
environment due to whether the federal government\'s decisions will be
implemented]{.underline}. How can we ask companies to invest billions of
dollars in a technology direction when the regulatory rug may be pulled
out from under them at the last moment?

## Hybrid War

The United States should take several actions to support this revision
of its strategy and approach to Russia.

• [[Analyze the Kremlin's]{.mark} decisions within the Russian
[framework of hybrid]{.mark} war [to understand and mitigate
Russian]{.mark} [lines of effort]{.mark}]{.underline}. Obfuscating the
nature and purpose of Kremlin activities is a key objective of hybrid
war, and US confusion about the term and the Russian approach to such
conflicts hinders the development of effective counterstrategies.

• [[Confront Russian hybrid wars in their entirety]{.mark} as synthetic
threats instead of confronting individual Russian lines of effort
separately and partially.]{.underline}

• [[Counter the Kremlin globally]{.mark} as well as in
Europe]{.underline}. Putin is not playing three-dimensional chess, but
instead playing many games of checkers simultaneously. [[The US policy
and military community should increase its analysis of the Kremlin's
hybrid wars]{.mark} outside Europe, including [in Syria, Libya, and
Venezuela]{.mark} while retaining necessary [focus on Ukraine, Belarus,
and the Baltic States.]{.mark}]{.underline}

• [Pursue whole-of-government coordination of information and kinetic
operations.]{.underline}

• [Reinforce Western norms and institutions---key targets of Russian
hybrid wars. The United States should not allow the Kremlin to normalize
its malign behavior and worldview.]{.underline}

• [Work to align the Russia policy of the United States and its allies.
**[The]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[should]{.mark} particularly [seek to standardize across NATO
the]{.mark} [red lines]{.mark} that would lead to [responses to Russian
actions.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

• [Actively challenge Russian information campaigns. The Kremlin's
information campaign is its center of gravity in each hybrid
war]{.underline}. The United States cannot win hybrid wars with Russia
if it loses in the information space.

• Deprive Russian PMCs and proxy forces of their deniability. [The
United States and its allies must relentlessly work to expose the
connections between these forces and the Kremlin and highlight that they
are direct tools of Russian military policy to reduce the Kremlin's
freedom of action.]{.underline}

• [[Recognize and plan for the military requirements to confront hybrid
threats]{.mark}.]{.underline} The United States should be prepared to
confront Russian hybrid wars with the conventional forces that will be
required and avoid establishing false red lines for the use of Western
forces against Russian aggressions.

• **[[Recognize that Russia also aims to avoid major great power
war]{.mark}. [The US]{.mark} [must]{.mark} of course continue to [deter
both nuclear and full-scale conventional war with
Russi]{.mark}]{.underline}**[a.]{.mark} But it must revise its strategy
to recognize that Russia also seeks to avoid such conflicts while
nevertheless accomplishing it goals.

• [Shift its military posture to confront the global nature of the
Kremlin threat.]{.underline}

[• [Enable deployed US forces to combat Russian hybrid wars with
non-kinetic means]{.mark}]{.underline}. Conventional forces can act as a
platform for additional cyber, civil-military relations, intelligence,
technical, and special operations assets which are essential in hybrid
wars.

The challenges presented by Russian hybrid war and preparations for the
future of war are not insurmountable. **[The West must not throw up its
hands at the challenge of confronting an unfamiliar conception of the
future of war. [The Kremlin is optimizing for its expectations of the
future of war]{.mark}, not ours, and [the West must fully understand the
Russian threat to successfully confront the
Kremlin.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

## Norms 

### 2AC \-\-- CP fails 

#### Norms-based approach leaves no one accountable -- it is ambiguous and lacks enforcement.

International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Prior to joining the
ICRC in 2019, he worked as an Associate Professor of Public

While the first two indicators relate to states' reluctance to act in
ways meaningful for the generation of new rules, the third concerns
their actual conduct in relation to cyber governance. It would be
inaccurate to claim that states have entirely given up on
standard-setting. However, [instead of interpreting or developing rules
of international law, state representatives have generally sought refuge
in the more ambiguous term 'norms'.]{.underline} [It is true that law
and norms are 'intimately intertwined' concepts and that inter-state
agreement on 'norms' may gradually influence the development of the
law.]{.underline}[[^38^]{.underline}](https://www-cambridge-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/core/journals/leiden-journal-of-international-law/article/from-cyber-norms-to-cyber-rules-reengaging-states-as-lawmakers/63A45029B685C11BBD9512AC0459FAE5#fn38)
[Yet, a fundamental difference between the two is that a violation of a
binding rule of international law gives rise to international legal
responsibility. while the same cannot be said of non-legal norms
regulating cyber conduct.]{.underline}

## Space 

### 2AC \-\-- China 

#### US SpaceX operations would anger China

Jim Pollard, 5-10-2022, \"China Fears US Will Use SpaceX to Bring
Calamity to World,\" Asia Financial,
<https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-fears-us-will-use-spacex-to-bring-calamity-to-world>

[The Starlink internet service run by Elon Musk's SpaceX may be used by
the "hegemony-obsessed US" to dominate space and bring "chaos or
calamity" to the world.]{.underline}

[That's according to a recent commentary published by China Military
Online, an official website linked to China's Central Military
Commission, which is headed by President Xi Jinping.]{.underline}

[It]{.underline} [expressed alarm about the use of the Starlink service
in Ukraine to interact with drones, and suggested that it may have
already played a role in the conflict with Russia via big data and
facial recognition technology]{.underline}.

Also on AF: China Already Outflanks US in AI, Says Ex-Pentagon Tech
Chief

"[SpaceX has decided to increase the number of Starlink satellites from
12,000 to 42,000]{.underline} [-- the programme's unchecked expansion
and the company's ambition to use it for military purposes should put
the international community on high alert]{.underline}," it said.
"[Clearly, the military applications of the Starlink program will give
the US military a head-start on the future battlefield and become an
\`accomplice' for the US to continue to dominate the
space."]{.underline}

The report said SpaceX launched 53 satellites last month and now has
2,400 satellites in a low-earth orbit.

Strong US Military Links

While Starlink claims to be a civilian program that provides high-speed
Internet services, the commentary claimed it has a strong military
background, citing launch sites built within the Vandenberg Air Force
Base. The group has launched satellites from American airbases and
cooperated with the military "many times," it said.

regarding The Starlink internet service run by SpaceX

Three years ago SpaceX received funds from the US Air Force to test how
well Starlink satellites can relay encrypted communication to military
aircraft, it said.

In 2020, the US Army allegedly signed a deal to use Starlink's broadband
to transmit data, plus a \$150-million contract to develop military
satellites, and last year it was transmitting data to F-35A fighter jets
at speeds "30 times faster than traditional connections," the commentary
added.

Starlink's satellites could have reconnaissance, navigation and
meteorological devices added to them to enhance the US military's combat
capability to boost remote sensing, communications, navigation and
positioning, attack and collision, and space sheltering, the report
said.

Impressed Pentagon

Pentagon officials were impressed last month by SpaceX's swift efforts
to block an electro-magnetic attack by Russia that aimed to jam its
Starlink broadband satellite service and help people in Ukraine retain
their link to the internet, according to a report by Defense News.

Elon Musk allegedly boasted that "Starlink was the only non-Russian
communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine in the wake
of the invasion."

There have also been reports of Starlink aiding the Ukrainian military
in precision strikes on Russian tanks and forces because its high data
rates enable better links. Drones could also serve as relay units to
transmit data.

China's Starlink Concerns

[The China Military Online report says Starlink is already a "space
juggernaut" and a megaproject that could transform global communications
and give birth to "a gigantic Starlink biosphere, and monopolize the
future space application market."]{.underline}

[It cited experts who say that if SpaceX installs a few root servers in
the space, "it can make Starlink the second independent global Internet,
which will pose a serious challenge to all countries in defending their
cyberspace sovereignty and protecting their information
security."]{.underline}

#### China and US won't cooperate now -- further tensions provide an opportunity for escalation

**Bin Li, 5-9-2022**, \"Space Won't Be Safe until the U.S. and China Can
Cooperate,\" Scientific American,
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/space-wont-be-safe-until-the-u-s-and-china-can-cooperate1/

[China is undeniably one of the world's top players in space these
days]{.underline}, with successful missions to the moon and Mars and a
solar probe due to be launched soon[. Its rise has spurred competition
with the U.S]{.underline}.; "Watch the Chinese," NASA Administrator Bill
Nelson recently warned. [Given the strategic value the two nations have
placed on their space programs, and the political tension that already
exists between the countries, the contest over achievements in space is
likely to intensify]{.underline}.

Despite the tension, [the U.S. and China must figure out a way to
cooperate on some, if not all, issues in the use of space. The most
critical area is the safety of space infrastructure, where a lack of
communication could be damaging and possibly even deadly]{.underline}.
This need was highlighted by the recent saga of a near miss between two
of Elon Musk's Starlink satellites and China's in-progress crewed space
station. Although the Starlink spacecraft are privately owned, the U.S.
government is internationally responsible for their space activities
under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.

Yet, there are serious barriers to a tête-à-tête---including the fact
that some kinds of cooperation are illegal. The [Wolf Amendment
prohibits NASA from using government funds to engage with the Chinese
government and China-affiliated organizations]{.underline}. However,
[this legislation does not block all cooperative possibilities, such as
exchanging orbit information about human-made space objects through
agencies like the North American Aerospace Defense Command]{.underline}.
[In the case of the Starlink satellites, U.S. representatives said they
had determined that the spacecraft posed no risk to the Chinese space
station. China, however, disagreed, and adjusted the station's orbit to
be safe. Cases like this could be better handled in the future through
direct communication]{.underline}.

[Both nations will continue to rely on space infrastructure for civil,
commercial and national security purposes. The U.S. has 2,944
satellites, more than half of the total number of operating satellites
in the world. This means that it has the most to lose from satellite
collisions and risks posed by space debris. China also has a large
collection, along with plans to send significant numbers of satellites
to low-Earth orbit in the next few years. The risks are growing from
what the U.N. calls "congested, contested and competitive" space, and it
suits both countries' interests to undertake constructive dialogues on
how to keep orbital passages safe.]{.underline}

[But the path ahead may not be smooth. The U.S. has accused China of
worsening the issue]{.underline}, notably [during a 2007 Chinese
antisatellite test that created more than 150,000 pieces of space
debris]{.underline}. Because everything in orbit is moving so fast, [a
collision between a small bit of debris and a spacecraft could prove
catastrophic.]{.underline} Yet, one year later, the U.S. shot down its
own satellite, although this event created fewer and shorter-lived
pieces of debris, because the intercept occurred at lower altitude so
the pieces burned up more quickly in Earth's atmosphere.

Despite the acrimony, the two sides appear to agree on some important
legal rules applicable to space. For instance, in a recent white paper,
China professes to use outer space "for peaceful purposes." Although
this claim is open to interpretation, similar language is also widely
used in U.S. space policy documents and even the Space Force's 2020
doctrine. The fact that there is some ambiguity to the term may be a
good starting point for the two countries to embark on a dialogue about
whether antisatellite testing, for instance, is a peaceful activity.
Although defensive in nature and not an act of war, it can pose threats
to others by creating more space debris.

China appears keen to be involved in the international rulemaking
process for space under the framework of the United Nations, according
to statements in the recent white paper. Realistically, China can
achieve this goal only through open and constructive engagement with
other stakeholder nations. Promisingly, in February, when asked about
the danger posed by the Starlink satellites to the Chinese space
station, a Chinese spokesperson expressed willingness to establish a
long-term communication mechanism with the U.S. to protect the safety of
its astronauts and space station.

But the continuing finger-pointing could hold both countries back. For
instance, the [U.S. and China recently exchanged diplomatic fire over a
U.S. unilateral commitment to stop all antisatellite missile
testing]{.underline}. [Though the move could seriously reduce the future
creation of space debris, the U.S. only did so while blaming Russia and
China for their previous tests. Not surprisingly, in response China
demanded that the U.S. "fully reflect upon its negative moves in the
field of outer space."]{.underline}

To make real progress, the two countries should adopt a "think big,
start small" approach. Because there is a lack of mutual trust between
the two sides at this stage, it would be unrealistic to expect an
agreement on space safety issues as a whole. By tackling smaller
problems, such as rules about communicating when a crewed space station
is at risk of collision, the two sides may more easily find common
interests and are more likely to work in a cooperative manner. Thus,
they can establish mutual trust in this process and, over time, expand
their cooperation to other spheres in space.
