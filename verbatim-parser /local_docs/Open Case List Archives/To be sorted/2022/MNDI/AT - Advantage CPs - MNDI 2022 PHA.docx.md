[The [Biotech]{.mark} [Revolution]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [Military]{.mark}
[Affairs]{.mark} There [have]{.mark} been numerous [studies]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the [impacts]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a wide array of [emergent
tech]{.mark}nologies [by]{.mark} **[hegemonic]{.mark} [actors]{.mark}**
or aspirants]{.underline} (For a preliminary list, see Jervis 1978, Levy
1984, Posen 1984, Shimshoni 1990, Arquilla and Ronfeldt 1997, Adams
1998, Murray and Millett 1998, Tannenwald 2008, Clarke and Knake 2010,
Vogel 2012, Waltz and Sagan 2012, Carpenter 2013). [However, [there has
been little examination of what the]{.mark} [adoption of
biotechn]{.mark}ology [by]{.mark} **the [leading military
powers]{.mark}** has meant or [is likely to mean]{.mark}. The United
States Office of Technology Assessment defines biotechnology as "any
technique that uses a living organism, or parts of organisms, to make or
modify products, to improve plants or animals, or to develop
microorganisms for specific uses."]{.underline} 320 D. Malet [Other
definitions include material patterned after living organisms but not
necessarily using them as components (biomimetics).]{.underline} The
conventional wisdom on biotechnology has held that [[coming]{.mark}
[decades]{.mark} [will]{.mark} [see]{.mark} **Western nations**
increasingly vulnerable to ever-[more sophisticated biological weapons
**attacks** by non-state actors and rogue states]{.mark}. As recombinant
genetic [**technology proliferates**, a greater number of actors will
possess genetic engineering capabilities that will enhance the
**lethality** and **durability** of]{.mark} their [bio]{.mark}logical
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Proponents of this perspective
note that the [overwhelming **[tech]{.mark}nological
[advantage]{.mark}** in conventional forces enjoyed by the United States
[creates]{.mark} the [incentive for competitors to develop]{.mark}
effective asymmetric responses, and that the affordability,
accessibility, and relatively easy preparation of [bio]{.mark}logical
[weapons]{.mark} make them a [likely]{.mark} means of doing
so.]{.underline} In this view, the [superior conventional capabilities
of the [US military not only **fail to deter the proliferation of
bio**]{.mark}**logical [weapons]{.mark}**[, but **encourage their
development**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Western states will face an
increasing number of biologically armed opponents, and will remain on
the defensive. The priority for military biotech research is therefore
the development of [protective]{.mark} equipment and vaccines,
antibiotics and antivirals]{.underline} (Department of Defense 1998).
However[, this scenario requires the presumption **[that]{.mark}
[military]{.mark} [applications of biotechnology]{.mark}** will simply
be a secular progression from the bacteriological warfare that has
existed throughout history.]{.underline} Even when [analysts have
factored in the vast possibilities of genetic engineering]{.underline},
it has usually only been [to the extent that they can breed deadlier
pathogens, and that [the growing availability of technology means that
it may be used by a **broader spectrum of
actors**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Conventional wisdom therefore
predicts an unstable future for the international system, a Hobbesian
world in which the weakest have power to kill the strongest. [Rather
than rogue states and non-state terrorists, it is the most powerful and
resource-laden actors in the international system that will enjoy the
advantages of "biological warfare" in the twenty-first century as they
continuously integrate emergent biotechnologies into their military and
national defense infrastructures and extend their
dominance.]{.underline} This process will closely resemble the
[Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA)]{.underline} that occurred during
the last 30 years of the twentieth century as the [United States adapted
its forces to exploit advances in new information
technologies]{.underline}. The RMA, first described by the Soviet
military intelligence in the 1970s and then witnessed by the world
during the unexpectedly uneven 1991 Gulf War, occurred because the
[United States employed its competitive advantage in integrated computer
systems. Rather than a single transformative device, like the atomic
bomb, the steady accretion of advanced technologies augmenting existing
equipment came to inform doctrine and strategies. The term asymmetric
warfare is meant to describe efforts by weaker participants in military
confrontations to frustrate the advantages of the stronger power by
guerilla tactics or other unconventional methods not envisioned in force
planning]{.underline} (Mack 1975). However, [[high technology also
offers **asymmetric advantages** to **the best-equipped actors**, and
American military planners sought to use the advances of the RMA to
field forces that no state competitor could match.]{.mark} Their goals
included "dominant maneuver" capability on the battlefield in bringing
dispersed resources to bear against targets, "precision engagement"
capability delivered by smart weapons, and **"[full dimension force
protection]{.mark}**["]{.mark} against all anticipated
threats]{.underline} (Rizwan 2000). [The ultimate expression of this
vision would be a fighter comparable to a "Jedi knight" from the Star
Wars films: [a **super-empowered solider**]{.mark}, dressed in a
protective stealth cloak and **[commanding]{.mark}** an Defence Studies
321 **[armed companion drone, able to perform solo missions and to
transmit data back to headquarters]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Hundley and
Gritton 1994). Coincidentally or not, this is precisely how Darth Maul
was depicted in 1999's The Phantom Menace. [Military planners likewise
foresee similar advantages conferred by developments across the various
biotech fields. In coming decades, biotechnology is forecast to bring
advances such as "rugged computers" made from biological components that
will provide situational awareness to individual soldiers on the
battlefield, camouflaged materials and lightweight armor incorporating
the properties of living organisms, and ingested biological markers to
distinguish friendlies, which would be of particular use in
counterinsurgency]{.underline} (Purdue University 2001). From the
perspective of those involved in force planning, [[the anticipated
**future is not one of vulnerability but
unassailability.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

more alarming is that [technological advancements in the field of
biological sciences will transform biological warfare agents into a new

Biopharma is Reaching an Inflection Point,"
https://www.biospace.com/article/investment-in-biopharma-is-reaching-an-inflection-point-/\]

Emerging biopharma companies are vital to the creation of many novel
therapies and health technologies, and play an important role in the
future of early-stage drug development. [Little wonder U.S.-based
biotech companies are the darling of private equity, venture capital
companies and institutional money managers.]{.underline}

[During the past two years, fundraising and investment in biotechnology
have reached record levels.]{.underline} These factors have translated
into elevated IPO activity and an overarching positive outlook.

[Private investments have been led by healthtech and biopharma, and the
first half of 2020 saw a general year-over-year increase in biotech
investment. The surge was led by 26 financings of \$100 million plus,
totaling more than \$5 billion. The first quarter of 2021, on the other
hand, climbed to a record \$23.4 billion in private investments, beating
out the quarterly record set in Q3 2020 by 56%. This momentum continued
into the second quarter of 2021 with total investment in healthtech and
biopharma equalling \$23.9 billion.]{.underline}

[According to data from IQVIA, around 80% of the industry\'s drug
development pipeline comes from emerging biopharma
companies,]{.underline} which means [small companies are the most
influential in developing innovative new therapies. Emerging biopharma
companies account for 84% of worldwide early-stage R&D and 73% of
late-stage research]{.underline}.

[In 2020, VC activity in biotech grew by 45%, bringing the global total
to \$36.6 billion USD, and the U.S. led the way.]{.underline}

## 5-G

### 2AC \-\-- CP fails 

#### 5G infighting causes economic nosedive -- governmental disputes wreck solvency -- only the plan solves

**Grossmann 22** \[J. DAVID GROSSMAN, VP OF REGULATORY AFFAIRS, CONSUMER
TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION (CTA)\"US 5G leadership depends on ending
government infighting,\" Light Reading,

Blitz

From Wi-Fi and smartphones to telehealth, fitness wearables and more --
wireless connectivity is a critical part of our daily lives. However,
recent government infighting over spectrum use threatens the technology
that so many Americans depend on. As the demand for faster and more
reliable wireless connectivity continues to grow, [it is time to reform
our nation\'s spectrum policy to make sure that spectrum continues to
benefit Americans]{.underline}. (See [After spending \$117B, US carriers
ask for even more 5G
spectrum](https://www.lightreading.com/5g/after-spending-$117b-us-carriers-ask-for-even-more-5g-spectrum/d/d-id/776097)).
Spectrum drives a large portion of consumer connectivity and technology
and influences America\'s economy. A recent [Consumer Technology
Association (CTA)
study](https://cta.tech/Resources/Newsroom/Media-Releases/2022/January/Unlicensed-Spectrum-Generates-95-Billion-Per-Year)
found that unlicensed spectrum generates \$95.8 billion per year in
incremental sales value, and there are billions more in economic
benefits from licensed spectrum used by our nation\'s wireless
providers. **DOT and FCC debris** [Good spectrum policy can create jobs,
spur innovation and grow GDP. Bad spectrum policy places US companies,
federal agencies and American consumers at a disadvantage]{.underline}
in a world where every country is competing to offer better technology
and services. [The US is risking the latter due to a lack of
coordination between government agencies.]{.underline} For example, [the
recent auction of the C-band for 5G, which raised nearly \$81 billion in
revenue, was followed by]{.underline} objections from the Federal
Aviation Administration ([FAA]{.underline}). This is not the first time
in recent memory that spectrum battles have erupted. There is an ongoing
dispute over the repurposing of spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band between the
Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC). Many more examples of bureaucratic infighting and
dysfunction have littered the spectrum landscape. Sadly, [these disputes
are not just Beltway parlor games; they have real consequences for
America\'s economy. American technology companies face an uncertain
environment due to whether the federal government\'s decisions will be
implemented]{.underline}. How can we ask companies to invest billions of
dollars in a technology direction when the regulatory rug may be pulled
out from under them at the last moment?

## Hybrid War

### 2AC \-\-- Perm do both 

#### Perm do both- Cooperating with EU and NATO against Russian Hybrid War tactics solves best.

The United States should take several actions to support this revision
of its strategy and approach to Russia.

• [[Analyze the Kremlin's]{.mark} decisions within the Russian
[framework of hybrid]{.mark} war [to understand and mitigate
Russian]{.mark} [lines of effort]{.mark}]{.underline}. Obfuscating the
nature and purpose of Kremlin activities is a key objective of hybrid
war, and US confusion about the term and the Russian approach to such
conflicts hinders the development of effective counterstrategies.

• [[Confront Russian hybrid wars in their entirety]{.mark} as synthetic
threats instead of confronting individual Russian lines of effort
separately and partially.]{.underline}

• [[Counter the Kremlin globally]{.mark} as well as in
Europe]{.underline}. Putin is not playing three-dimensional chess, but
instead playing many games of checkers simultaneously. [[The US policy
and military community should increase its analysis of the Kremlin's
hybrid wars]{.mark} outside Europe, including [in Syria, Libya, and
Venezuela]{.mark} while retaining necessary [focus on Ukraine, Belarus,
and the Baltic States.]{.mark}]{.underline}

• [Pursue whole-of-government coordination of information and kinetic
operations.]{.underline}

• [Reinforce Western norms and institutions---key targets of Russian
hybrid wars. The United States should not allow the Kremlin to normalize
its malign behavior and worldview.]{.underline}

• [Work to align the Russia policy of the United States and its allies.
**[The]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[should]{.mark} particularly [seek to standardize across NATO
the]{.mark} [red lines]{.mark} that would lead to [responses to Russian
actions.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

• [Actively challenge Russian information campaigns. The Kremlin's
information campaign is its center of gravity in each hybrid
war]{.underline}. The United States cannot win hybrid wars with Russia
if it loses in the information space.

• Deprive Russian PMCs and proxy forces of their deniability. [The
United States and its allies must relentlessly work to expose the
connections between these forces and the Kremlin and highlight that they
are direct tools of Russian military policy to reduce the Kremlin's
freedom of action.]{.underline}

• [[Recognize and plan for the military requirements to confront hybrid
threats]{.mark}.]{.underline} The United States should be prepared to
confront Russian hybrid wars with the conventional forces that will be
required and avoid establishing false red lines for the use of Western
forces against Russian aggressions.

• **[[Recognize that Russia also aims to avoid major great power
war]{.mark}. [The US]{.mark} [must]{.mark} of course continue to [deter
both nuclear and full-scale conventional war with
Russi]{.mark}]{.underline}**[a.]{.mark} But it must revise its strategy
to recognize that Russia also seeks to avoid such conflicts while
nevertheless accomplishing it goals.

• [Shift its military posture to confront the global nature of the
Kremlin threat.]{.underline}

[• [Enable deployed US forces to combat Russian hybrid wars with
non-kinetic means]{.mark}]{.underline}. Conventional forces can act as a
platform for additional cyber, civil-military relations, intelligence,
technical, and special operations assets which are essential in hybrid
wars.

The challenges presented by Russian hybrid war and preparations for the
future of war are not insurmountable. **[The West must not throw up its
hands at the challenge of confronting an unfamiliar conception of the
future of war. [The Kremlin is optimizing for its expectations of the
future of war]{.mark}, not ours, and [the West must fully understand the
Russian threat to successfully confront the
Kremlin.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

## Norms 

### 2AC \-\-- CP fails 

#### Norms-based approach leaves no one accountable -- it is ambiguous and lacks enforcement.

**MaČÁK 17** \[Kubo MaČÁK, Dr Kubo Mačák is a legal adviser at the

Blitz

While the first two indicators relate to states' reluctance to act in
ways meaningful for the generation of new rules, the third concerns
their actual conduct in relation to cyber governance. It would be
inaccurate to claim that states have entirely given up on
standard-setting. However, [instead of interpreting or developing rules
of international law, state representatives have generally sought refuge
in the more ambiguous term 'norms'.]{.underline} [It is true that law
and norms are 'intimately intertwined' concepts and that inter-state
agreement on 'norms' may gradually influence the development of the
law.]{.underline}[[^38^]{.underline}](https://www-cambridge-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/core/journals/leiden-journal-of-international-law/article/from-cyber-norms-to-cyber-rules-reengaging-states-as-lawmakers/63A45029B685C11BBD9512AC0459FAE5#fn38)
[Yet, a fundamental difference between the two is that a violation of a
binding rule of international law gives rise to international legal
responsibility. while the same cannot be said of non-legal norms
regulating cyber conduct.]{.underline}

## Space 

### 2AC \-\-- China 

#### US SpaceX operations would anger China

Jim Pollard, 5-10-2022, \"China Fears US Will Use SpaceX to Bring
Calamity to World,\" Asia Financial,
<https://www.asiafinancial.com/china-fears-us-will-use-spacex-to-bring-calamity-to-world>

[The Starlink internet service run by Elon Musk's SpaceX may be used by
the "hegemony-obsessed US" to dominate space and bring "chaos or
calamity" to the world.]{.underline}

[That's according to a recent commentary published by China Military
Online, an official website linked to China's Central Military
Commission, which is headed by President Xi Jinping.]{.underline}

[It]{.underline} [expressed alarm about the use of the Starlink service
in Ukraine to interact with drones, and suggested that it may have
already played a role in the conflict with Russia via big data and
facial recognition technology]{.underline}.

Also on AF: China Already Outflanks US in AI, Says Ex-Pentagon Tech
Chief

"[SpaceX has decided to increase the number of Starlink satellites from
12,000 to 42,000]{.underline} [-- the programme's unchecked expansion
and the company's ambition to use it for military purposes should put
the international community on high alert]{.underline}," it said.
"[Clearly, the military applications of the Starlink program will give
the US military a head-start on the future battlefield and become an
\`accomplice' for the US to continue to dominate the
space."]{.underline}

The report said SpaceX launched 53 satellites last month and now has
2,400 satellites in a low-earth orbit.

Strong US Military Links

While Starlink claims to be a civilian program that provides high-speed
Internet services, the commentary claimed it has a strong military
background, citing launch sites built within the Vandenberg Air Force
Base. The group has launched satellites from American airbases and
cooperated with the military "many times," it said.

Infographic on the commentary published by China Military Online
regarding The Starlink internet service run by SpaceX

Three years ago SpaceX received funds from the US Air Force to test how
well Starlink satellites can relay encrypted communication to military
aircraft, it said.

In 2020, the US Army allegedly signed a deal to use Starlink's broadband
to transmit data, plus a \$150-million contract to develop military
satellites, and last year it was transmitting data to F-35A fighter jets
at speeds "30 times faster than traditional connections," the commentary
added.

Starlink's satellites could have reconnaissance, navigation and
meteorological devices added to them to enhance the US military's combat
capability to boost remote sensing, communications, navigation and
positioning, attack and collision, and space sheltering, the report
said.

Impressed Pentagon

Pentagon officials were impressed last month by SpaceX's swift efforts
to block an electro-magnetic attack by Russia that aimed to jam its
Starlink broadband satellite service and help people in Ukraine retain
their link to the internet, according to a report by Defense News.

Elon Musk allegedly boasted that "Starlink was the only non-Russian
communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine in the wake
of the invasion."

There have also been reports of Starlink aiding the Ukrainian military
in precision strikes on Russian tanks and forces because its high data
rates enable better links. Drones could also serve as relay units to
transmit data.

China's Starlink Concerns

[The China Military Online report says Starlink is already a "space
juggernaut" and a megaproject that could transform global communications
and give birth to "a gigantic Starlink biosphere, and monopolize the
future space application market."]{.underline}

[It cited experts who say that if SpaceX installs a few root servers in
the space, "it can make Starlink the second independent global Internet,
which will pose a serious challenge to all countries in defending their
cyberspace sovereignty and protecting their information
security."]{.underline}

#### China and US won't cooperate now -- further tensions provide an opportunity for escalation

**Bin Li, 5-9-2022**, \"Space Won't Be Safe until the U.S. and China Can
Cooperate,\" Scientific American,
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/space-wont-be-safe-until-the-u-s-and-china-can-cooperate1/

[China is undeniably one of the world's top players in space these
days]{.underline}, with successful missions to the moon and Mars and a
solar probe due to be launched soon[. Its rise has spurred competition
with the U.S]{.underline}.; "Watch the Chinese," NASA Administrator Bill
Nelson recently warned. [Given the strategic value the two nations have
placed on their space programs, and the political tension that already
exists between the countries, the contest over achievements in space is
likely to intensify]{.underline}.

Despite the tension, [the U.S. and China must figure out a way to
cooperate on some, if not all, issues in the use of space. The most
critical area is the safety of space infrastructure, where a lack of
communication could be damaging and possibly even deadly]{.underline}.
This need was highlighted by the recent saga of a near miss between two
of Elon Musk's Starlink satellites and China's in-progress crewed space
station. Although the Starlink spacecraft are privately owned, the U.S.
government is internationally responsible for their space activities
under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.

Yet, there are serious barriers to a tête-à-tête---including the fact
that some kinds of cooperation are illegal. The [Wolf Amendment
prohibits NASA from using government funds to engage with the Chinese
government and China-affiliated organizations]{.underline}. However,
[this legislation does not block all cooperative possibilities, such as
exchanging orbit information about human-made space objects through
agencies like the North American Aerospace Defense Command]{.underline}.
[In the case of the Starlink satellites, U.S. representatives said they
had determined that the spacecraft posed no risk to the Chinese space
station. China, however, disagreed, and adjusted the station's orbit to
be safe. Cases like this could be better handled in the future through
direct communication]{.underline}.

[Both nations will continue to rely on space infrastructure for civil,
commercial and national security purposes. The U.S. has 2,944
satellites, more than half of the total number of operating satellites
in the world. This means that it has the most to lose from satellite
collisions and risks posed by space debris. China also has a large
collection, along with plans to send significant numbers of satellites
to low-Earth orbit in the next few years. The risks are growing from
what the U.N. calls "congested, contested and competitive" space, and it
suits both countries' interests to undertake constructive dialogues on
how to keep orbital passages safe.]{.underline}

[But the path ahead may not be smooth. The U.S. has accused China of
worsening the issue]{.underline}, notably [during a 2007 Chinese
antisatellite test that created more than 150,000 pieces of space
debris]{.underline}. Because everything in orbit is moving so fast, [a
collision between a small bit of debris and a spacecraft could prove
catastrophic.]{.underline} Yet, one year later, the U.S. shot down its
own satellite, although this event created fewer and shorter-lived
pieces of debris, because the intercept occurred at lower altitude so
the pieces burned up more quickly in Earth's atmosphere.

Despite the acrimony, the two sides appear to agree on some important
legal rules applicable to space. For instance, in a recent white paper,
China professes to use outer space "for peaceful purposes." Although
this claim is open to interpretation, similar language is also widely
used in U.S. space policy documents and even the Space Force's 2020
doctrine. The fact that there is some ambiguity to the term may be a
good starting point for the two countries to embark on a dialogue about
whether antisatellite testing, for instance, is a peaceful activity.
Although defensive in nature and not an act of war, it can pose threats
to others by creating more space debris.

China appears keen to be involved in the international rulemaking
process for space under the framework of the United Nations, according
to statements in the recent white paper. Realistically, China can
achieve this goal only through open and constructive engagement with
other stakeholder nations. Promisingly, in February, when asked about
the danger posed by the Starlink satellites to the Chinese space
station, a Chinese spokesperson expressed willingness to establish a
long-term communication mechanism with the U.S. to protect the safety of
its astronauts and space station.

But the continuing finger-pointing could hold both countries back. For
instance, the [U.S. and China recently exchanged diplomatic fire over a
U.S. unilateral commitment to stop all antisatellite missile
testing]{.underline}. [Though the move could seriously reduce the future
creation of space debris, the U.S. only did so while blaming Russia and
China for their previous tests. Not surprisingly, in response China
demanded that the U.S. "fully reflect upon its negative moves in the
field of outer space."]{.underline}

To make real progress, the two countries should adopt a "think big,
start small" approach. Because there is a lack of mutual trust between
the two sides at this stage, it would be unrealistic to expect an
agreement on space safety issues as a whole. By tackling smaller
problems, such as rules about communicating when a crewed space station
is at risk of collision, the two sides may more easily find common
interests and are more likely to work in a cooperative manner. Thus,
they can establish mutual trust in this process and, over time, expand
their cooperation to other spheres in space.
