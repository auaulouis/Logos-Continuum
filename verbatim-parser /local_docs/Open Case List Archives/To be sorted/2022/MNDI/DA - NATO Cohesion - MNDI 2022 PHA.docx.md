# DA -- Turkey / NATO Unity -- MNDI AHP

### Notes

#### Thanks to other labs for link evidence that we included in this file -- including Khirn and Tim Alderete.

#### Thanks to Bennett, Nina, Alex, Dora, Aiman, TJ, Lilian, Hannah, Evelina and Yechen who worked hard to complete this file.

#### You should not read both of these arguments separately in the 1nc because there is a lot of overlap in terms of links and internal links. If you have a specific link that Turkey would oppose the plan, I would recommend reading that version. In either case, the links and internal links from the other could be used to strengthen the overriding thesis that a strong, unified, and expanding NATO is necessary to effectively deter Russia.

#### Time did not permit us to develop this file as fully as we wanted. Here are some suggestions for supplementing it in the future:

- Expand the link section -- this is very important because many
  affirmatives will utilize their solvency or "say yes" evidence to
  demonstrate that the plan is popular and possibly improves unity with
  NATO. Even if all NATO states [eventually support]{.underline} the
  plan, you could develop a link around the [diplomatic
  capital]{.underline}, [concessions]{.underline} or
  [horse-trading]{.underline} that the U.S. or other member states would
  have to do in order to reach consensus

- Find more reasons why it is good to include Finland and Sweden in NATO
  outside of deterring Russia. This would give the disad an impact
  external to many affirmatives.

- Both arguments could become net benefits to consultation counterplans.

### 1nc DA NATO Unity

#### Ensuring [Russian strategic failure]{.underline} in Ukraine is the U.S. goal [BUT]{.underline} it's [not a guarantee]{.underline} and requires full [cooperation and unity]{.underline} of allies to make adjustments to [strategy]{.underline} and [posture]{.underline}

Transatlantic Security Initiative** (May 11, 2022, Connor, "How can the
US and NATO help bring about Russia's 'strategic failure' in Ukraine?"

JMP)

With Ukraine having repelled Russian forces near Kyiv, [the Kremlin's
war of aggression has entered a new phase: a more limited offensive in
eastern Ukraine. As the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and its transatlantic allies and partners
formulate fresh strategies for what will likely be a protracted
conflict, there are several factors they must consider]{.underline},
senior officials and experts said at a recent Atlantic Council event.

[The US objective is Russian "strategic failure"---militarily,
politically and economically]{.underline}--- US Assistant Secretary of
Defense for International Security Affairs Celeste Wallander said at the
May 2 conference, titled "Priorities for the NATO Summit and Security in
Europe." That would involve in the long term "holding the Russian
leadership to account in front of its own population and in front of the
global stage," she said. Wallander's comments expanded on US Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin's recent statement that the United States
"want\[s\] to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the
kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine."

What Russian accountability will look like is unclear at this point.
However, US Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), speaking at the conference,
argued that the United States has to "look ahead to a regime change
before we could ever have anything in the way of a productive working
relationship with Russia," and describing Russian President Vladimir
Putin as "not fit to serve."

At the same time, Michael [Kofman, research program director at the
Russia Studies Program of CNA, cautioned against treating Russia's
comprehensive strategic failure in the war as a foregone
conclusion]{.underline}. Indeed, **[the "trend lines favor
Ukraine,"]{.underline}** he said. [However, changes in Russia's tactics
such as full mobilization could lead to a **longer, more drawn-out
conflict**]{.underline}, Kofman added, addressing the event ahead of the
NATO summit scheduled for late June.

[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
NATO must not learn the wrong lessons from the war]{.underline}, he
said. [The Russian military, despite taking a beating so far, **still
presents a real threat**]{.underline}. "I'm worried that I'm going to
have to spend a lot of years now arguing that \[the Russian military\]
isn't four feet tall," said Kofman. When it comes to new defense
investments, Alliance members should also avoid relying on broad
conclusions about the effectiveness of capabilities in Ukraine, warned
former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen (Ret.) James
Cartwright.

[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
NATO allies need to continue and expand their supply of ammunition and
heavier artillery weapons that have been a key part of Ukrainian
battlefield success against Russia]{.underline}, according to Kofman.
Yet, nations supplying Ukraine must also take care that they do not
deplete their own stocks of critical weapons systems too much, with the
pipeline to produce and replace advanced weapons sent to Ukraine being
"quite narrow" in many cases, as described by Kofman. The United States
can play a critical role here as the "arsenal of democracy," harking
back to the role it played in World War II, some speakers suggested. US
Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) said that the United States was "going to
have to look at ramping up production... to make sure that all of our
allies have what they need" to supply Ukraine while maintaining their
own supplies.

[The Alliance will also need to make major adjustments to its strategy
and posture]{.underline} in Eastern Europe, speakers said. [Already,
allies have shifted significant forces further east, making NATO's
conventional deterrence "the strongest that it has been... in our
lifetimes"]{.underline} [according to US Assistant Secretary of Defense
for Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities]{.underline} Mara
[Karlin]{.underline}. Former Supreme Allied Commander Europe Gen (Ret.)
Philip M. Breedlove added that NATO has to be ready to "seize the
moment" and "move readiness and capability forward" in Europe. [More
ready and capable forces, including persistent, rotational US
deployments to Eastern Europe will help move NATO from a deterrence by
punishment posture to deterrence by denial, **making it harder for any
future Russian attack** to take and hold NATO territory.]{.underline}

[NATO will]{.underline} also [move to finalize its new Strategic Concept
this summer, the first new guiding strategy for the Alliance since
2010]{.underline}. "The 2022 edition will definitely be the most
challenging," said Alexander Vershbow, Atlantic Council distinguished
fellow, former NATO deputy secretary general, and former US ambassador
to Russia. Vershbow agreed with Breedlove, saying that [the Strategic
Concept should revamp NATO's defense and deterrence posture by shifting
more forces forward. Many of these forces, if and when they are
deployed, will go to the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania---frontline nations that are some of the Alliance's most
vulnerable members]{.underline}. These countries have long been
advocates for increased allied presence in the region. Speaking at the
conference, Lithuanian Minister of National Defense Arvydas Anušauskas
highlighted increased spending by the country on facilities to enable it
to host larger numbers of allied forces in the future.

Throughout the discussion, panelists emphasized that [the conflict and
the new strategic circumstances that Russia has created in Europe will
shape the security dynamic there for the foreseeable
future]{.underline}, and [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**ntied
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and its allies in NATO will **need to remain
focused and united** to **adapt to this challenge** and **ensure Russia
meets strategic failure**]{.underline}. In the words of Michael Kofman,
"Security in Europe is an unfinished business, and to me this conflict
reflects that."

#### This unity is [not guaranteed]{.underline} and takes a [lot of work]{.underline} and [active diplomacy]{.underline} to sustain

**Wormuth, 22 \-\-- Secretary of the Army, US Department of Defense**
(June 2, 2022, Christine Wormuth, moderated by Vivian Salama who serves
as a national security reporter at The Wall Street Journal "NATO allies
must not take their unity on Ukraine for granted, says Secretary of the
Army Christine Wormuth,"

JMP)

VIVIAN SALAMA: President Biden has repeatedly made it clear that there
are not going to be boots on the ground in this conflict so long as it's
isolated within Ukraine's borders. Something I heard repeatedly while I
was there is that military leaders and the president's office even are
concerned that as this conflict increasingly becomes prolonged, momentum
to assist, to keep on fueling them with weapons, with assistance, with
other kinds of training, could start to wane and especially when we have
our own domestic priorities to worry about.

And so how do you see the US sustaining this level of support for
Ukraine in a way that could actually make a difference in embattled
regions like the Donbas, which is suffering significantly right now?

CHRISTINE WORMUTH: I think---you know, I think [the administration has
done]{.underline}, frankly, [an admirable job]{.underline}, you know,
[helping the alliance come together and have the]{.underline} very,
[**very strong unified position** that we've had against the Russian
invasion]{.underline}, and I think [we'll continue to see that unity,
frankly. **It will take work.**]{.underline} I know [from my own
experience]{.underline}, you know, [back in 2014 and 2015 it **takes a
lot of active diplomacy to be able to sustain that alliance
unity**]{.underline}. But I think, you know, [all of the NATO countries
see what is at stake]{.underline}, frankly, in what's happening, [and
that alone]{.underline}, I think, [is an incentive for us to maintain
unity]{.underline}. I think, you know, in a practical way, we are
looking---you know, certainly in the Department of Defense and in the
Army---at how---you know, what do we need to be doing to allow us to
continue to sustain the kind of lethal assistance that we're providing
to the Ukrainians? And that's why we've signed contracts to replenish
our Stingers and replenish our Javelins. You know, we have really leaned
into trying to provide, you know, everything that the policymakers deem
essential to get to the Ukrainians, and, you know, we have taken some
risk to our own readiness, not an unacceptable level of risk at all. But
I think we will continue to do that, and I think, you know, again, **[we
can't take that unity for granted]{.underline}**, but I think the NATO
countries know what's at stake.

VIVIAN SALAMA: Where does the US draw the line? I mean, we're hearing a
lot these days, and I was hearing it in Ukraine, about multiple-launch
rocket systems and other long-range rocket systems that they so
desperately need; the US has sort of wavered on this a little bit in
recent weeks, and so, you know, a lot of reporting that it's going to be
announced this week. Can you tell us, you know, where the US stands as
far as those types of systems getting into the hands of Ukrainian
fighters?

CHRISTINE WORMUTH: I think where the US stands is, you know, wanting to
provide all of the assistance that we can to the Ukrainians without
escalating the situation to a point where, you know, the war spills over
or, frankly, you know, goes in a terrible direction. I mean, there's
been, you know, discussion about if Putin starts to feel cornered, you
know, would he lash out? Would he contemplate using chemical weapons,
for example, or even, you know, more horrifically, potentially some sort
of a tactical nuclear demonstration? So I think, you know, we in the
administration have to very prudently measure those risks, you know, and
to think very carefully about, you know, how can we best, again, give
the Ukrainian military what they need? We are in, obviously, a grinding
artillery battle right now that I think---you know, it's going to be
more challenging, frankly, to sustain the morale of the Ukrainian
forces, you know, given the bombardment that they're being subject to.
But again, you know, [we cannot allow this war to escalate]{.underline}.
[Then]{.underline} I think [you will see]{.underline}---if you want to
talk about concerns to NATO unity, [concerns for the American support
for this conflict, if it escalates, I think that unity will be much more
challenging to sustain.]{.underline}

[NATO needs to take a **hard look** at itself]{.underline}. Across
twenty-five indicators of [democracy]{.underline} rated by Freedom
House, the **[downward trend]{.underline}** among NATO allies over the
past decade [is **stark**]{.underline}.35 [Especially in **Central
Europe**]{.underline} but not exclusively, there are setbacks in the
media, the judiciary and the functioning of national democratic
institutions. The rate at which [democracy is declining in **Poland**,
**Hungary** and **Turkey**]{.underline} is particularly alarming. In
2017 and 2018, these three states' scores represented some of the
largest one-year declines in political rights and civil liberties of all
195 countries ranked by Freedom House.36 Poland---with the largest
category declines in the forty-year history of the survey---is close to
leaving the "consolidated democracy" category.37 Hungary is no longer
rated a consolidated democracy. Turkey, whose decline in freedom over
the last ten years represents the largest of any country in the world,
crossed the threshold from "free" to "not free."38

While less severe today, [nationalist **populism**
movements]{.underline} in other allies [represent a broader, more
diffuse threat to NATO and can **amplify other challenges** facing the
Alliance]{.underline}. The United States is not immune, with its Freedom
House rating declining in 2018 due to "Russian interference in the 2016
election, violations of basic ethical standards by the new
administration and a reduction in government transparency."39 While this
slippage in the U.S. is relatively recent and still minor in scale, it
nonetheless diminishes America's standing as a standard-bearer for
democracy and further erodes its leadership position within the
Alliance. Further, anti-democratic policies among allies open
vulnerabilities for interference by competitors outside the Alliance,
especially Russia that seeks to divide NATO and the EU politically using
hybrid tactics.40

The question for allies is what must the role of the Alliance be in
reinforcing its core values when they are under assault from within.
NATO is both a political and a military alliance. It is not enough to be
bound together by a commitment only to Article 5 collective defense. The
values in the Treaty and the adherence of NATO allies to those values is
fundamental for Alliance cohesion. That shared commitment to values in
turn makes credible the Article 5 commitment. The Washington Treaty is
binding for both its political and military commitments.41 Allies cannot
ignore the failure to abide by political commitments including values
and expect military commitments to be unaffected. In short, NATO allies
should not expect that they could violate democratic values without
consequences, while resting assured that NATO cohesion is intact and
other commitments in the Treaty will be upheld. The Treaty is not a menu
of options from which allies can select some obligations while ignoring
others.

The NATO Treaty has no provision for policing members that drift from
common political values, unlike the European Union Treaty's Chapter 7
that has been invoked recently toward several EU member states with some
success.42 While it would be impossible to achieve consensus to impose
penalties on wayward allies, given that the ally in question could veto
any penalties, a range of escalating political initiatives on the part
of the Secretary General and a coalition of the other allies could
assert pressure. As a start, the Secretary General should express
concern in his bilateral meetings with the anti-democratic governments,
with the support of key allies and in partnership with the European
Union. To increase awareness within the Alliance and among the public,
foreign ministers could review annually indicators of democracy for all
twenty-nine allies, perhaps prepared by an informal high-level group of
experts drawing on Freedom House data. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly
and coalitions of allies can amplify the message.43 To increase
pressure, NATO could suspend hosting of visits, official meetings and
even military exercises with these nations. In severe cases, NATO
infrastructure spending and even access to military schools and
information sharing could be affected. An indirect way to express
concern among allies is to increase the prominence of core democratic
values when considering NATO enlargement decisions in the future.44 None
of these steps is without political cost and risk, even if calibrated
carefully. But the costs and risks of the gradual erosion of Alliance
cohesion as member states drift from the founding values are even
greater. NATO cannot expect to remain coherent and relevant and able to
address the full range of challenges it faces, if it ignores the
internal drift from democracy within some member states. This drift is a
fundamental issue for the Alliance.45

Streamlining NATO Decision-Making

Finally, the challenges facing NATO today demand more flexibility in
executive decision-making. As a core principle in preserving NATO
cohesion, consensus decision-making must remain the basis for major NATO
actions.46 [The Treaty requirements for **consensus** on]{.underline}
collective defense decisions [(Article 5)]{.underline} and enlargement
decisions (Article 10) [remain sensible]{.underline}. Major policy
decisions like the Defense Investment Pledge or the creation of the Very
High Readiness Joint Task Force rapid reaction capabilities require
consensus. [But today with NATO **enlarged** to **twenty-nine** members
and facing increasingly **diverse** and **complex** challenges, it is
time to **consider**]{.underline} how other, more routine,
administrative decisions can be taken more efficiently. But this should
be a management function, not derogation from the consensus principle.

We recommend strengthening the Secretary General's role as the chief
executive of the Alliance with broader authority to carry out routine
business without seeking consensus among the twenty-nine members. For
example, the Secretary General should consult allies on matters such as
agendas and timings of Ministerial Council meetings, but not be required
to seek consensus agreement. Today the agenda and even the dates of a
Foreign Minister meeting or a NATO-Russia Council meeting can consume
hours of formal Council time seeking consensus at the ambassadorial
level, consuming headquarters' bandwidth and crowding out more
substantive and urgent topics, including many outlined in this paper.
Further, the Secretary General's flexibility on international staff
personnel changes and NATO budget matters should be increased. Today,
for example, the Secretary General is severely constrained from adapting
the Alliance to emerging challenges by making meaningful shifts in
personnel and budgetary resources.47 While nations will continue to want
a critical role in all these decisions, criteria should be developed
that will provide for more flexibility while ensuring that all allies
gain a fair share of opportunities and allocation of resources.

[A related problem is the tendency of]{.underline} some [allies to
**bring into** the Alliance **bilateral issues** that **impede
progress** on collective issues of the Alliance. As an example, an ally
might **hold up agreement** on the **entire** NATO]{.underline} military
exercise [program because of an **unrelated bilateral dispute** with a
**NATO partner**]{.underline} who wishes to participate in an
exercise.48 [This practice **erodes Alliance cohesion**]{.underline} and
should not be permitted. After appropriate consultation, we recommend
the Secretary General should have the authority to exclude such external
issues from consideration in the Alliance, even if it means moving
forward without full consensus.

Introduction

[The large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} now underway
[could]{.underline} quite plausibly [precipitate a **wider conflict in
Europe**]{.underline}. The United States is focused primarily on raising
the costs to Russia with punishing sanctions and reassuring North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies neighboring Russia of its
commitment to collective defense. Less attention has been given to
containing the war to Ukraine and preventing its escalation into a
broader European conflict.

The stakes are enormous. [The ripple effects of a wider conflict in
Europe would **spread across the globe**]{.underline}, [stressing the
**geopolitical, economic, and institutional foundations of the
international order** the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has fashioned and underwritten since the end
of the Second World War]{.underline}. [It would test the resilience of
the U.S. global system of alliances, the international financial system,
global energy markets, arms control regimes, and global institutions in
the face of ever **more violent great power competition**.]{.underline}
[No region of the world would be spared]{.underline}, although
developments on the Eurasian supercontinent, the other locus of world
power and economic might outside North America, would bear the gravest
consequences for U.S. interests.

The Contingency

[The Russian military intervention]{.underline} in Ukraine [could
**easily escalate** into a **larger conflict** stretching from the
Baltic to the Black Sea and further west into Europe]{.underline}.
Although Russia, wielding massive military superiority, might overrun
Ukrainian forces in a matter of weeks, stabilizing and pacifying the
country will likely prove to be a grueling and costly affair. A
significant Ukrainian resistance movement is almost certain to emerge.
With sustained Western support, it could prolong the warfare for months,
if not years. The first wave of sanctions that Washington has levied on
Moscow could be followed by others in a continuing effort to raise the
cost to Moscow and force it to yield. A negotiated end to the conflict
will not come easily, since Washington has framed it in Manichean terms
as a world historical struggle between the democratic West and the
aggressive, malevolent, and autocratic Russia. Anything short of
"victory" will be decried as surrender or appeasement in the West, while
Russia will not capitulate on a matter it considers vital to its
security and prosperity.

The stage is thus set for an escalating cycle of violence, with Moscow
seeking to stamp out a Ukrainian insurgency and retaliate against
Western efforts to stop Russia's advance. [If the conflict wears on,
Moscow could be increasingly tempted to **expand its military
operations** further into Europe to achieve its goals.]{.underline}

As a first option, [Russia could intensify pressure on states
neighboring Ukraine]{.underline} (e.g., Hungary, Poland, Romania, and
Slovakia) that could provide safe havens for insurgents or the
inevitable government-in-exile. It will doubtless reinforce its military
presence in Kaliningrad and elsewhere in the Baltics and patrol the
Baltic Sea more aggressively. It could deploy hybrid-war
tactics---cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and economic
sabotage---to destabilize countries providing safe havens. If those
actions did not sufficiently degrade the resistance, Moscow could even
launch direct attacks on insurgents and their supporters outside
Ukraine, as well as attempt to assassinate leading figures in the
government-in-exile, akin to the attacks it has made on Chechen rebels
and Federal Security Service (FSB) defectors in Europe in recent years.
Such steps could, at a minimum, draw frontline NATO states directly into
the military conflict with Russia, obligating the United States and
other allies to come to their defense.

To build up further pressure, Moscow could also "weaponize" the
inevitable refugee flows into neighboring states. Refugees, who would
likely number in the millions, would move first into unoccupied
Ukrainian territory but eventually into adjacent European states, which
have shown little tolerance for outsiders. Moscow could use harsh
military and police tactics that would increase the number of refugees
and seek to guide them into countries where they would create the
greatest socioeconomic stress, such as Moldova. In addition, Moscow
could increase the tension by pushing Belarusian President Aleksandr
Lukashenko to again seek to push thousands of Middle Eastern migrants
across the borders into Poland and Lithuania. That could lead to border
clashes, as it almost did on occasion last fall, with Russia supporting
its ally, Belarus, and NATO states coming to the defense of allies under
attack.

A second option Moscow could pursue is opening up a second front in the
Balkans. In recent years, Russia has taken a number of destabilizing
actions in the region, seeking to weaken Montenegro after its accession
to NATO, exacerbate tensions between Serbs and Bosniaks in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and undermine relations between Serbia and Kosovo.
As it fought in Ukraine, Russia could encourage Republika Srpska leader
Milorad Dodik to press for separation from Bosnia, threatening to
reignite the bitter wars of the 1990s in the former Yugoslavia. A
Balkans war would complicate the security calculus of all countries in
the region, as well as that of Germany and France, which have
significant interests there. To quell the fighting, NATO countries could
decide to use military force against Bosnian Serb forces enjoying
Russian support.

A third, riskier, option would be to directly attack the United States,
the country that Moscow believes is orchestrating a larger anti-Russia
campaign. In response to Western sanctions designed to crater Russia's
financial system and undermine critical industries, Moscow could launch
major cyberattacks against U.S. critical infrastructure. If a
cyberattack were to take down a major financial institution or corrupt
its records, the ensuing havoc in U.S. markets could prompt overwhelming
public and congressional pressure for a forceful response.

The U.S. and NATO response to Russian actions will impact Moscow's
decisions on the conduct of the conflict. Both a weak response and an
excessively harsh one could lead to escalation. In the first case,
Moscow could be tempted to press militarily even further into Europe to
enlarge its sphere of influence. Vladimir Putin has demanded that NATO
withdraw its forces back to the lines they held in 1997, when the
NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed and the first wave of post−Cold War
expansion remained in the future. His remarks announcing the start of
hostilities against Ukraine hinted at a broader effort to restore
Russia's control over all of the former Soviet Union. That could include
military action against the Baltic states, especially Lithuania, through
which Moscow could try to carve out a land corridor to Kaliningrad, a
Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea. NATO would have little choice but to
provide military aid to those states if it did not want to forfeit its
role as the central pillar of European security.

Crippling sanctions, meanwhile, could provoke Putin to lash out with
greater violence. If Putin felt cornered, he could escalate the conflict
either horizontally to other countries or vertically to the nuclear
level in a desperate effort to save himself, his regime, and, in his
mind, Russia itself. And he could find considerable public support for
such a reaction. Already, some Russians believe that U.S. and EU
sanctions are aimed not simply at the leaders behind the war but, by
cratering the economy, at all Russians.

Warning Indicators

As is the case with the current crisis in Ukraine, Moscow's intentions
will remain ambiguous. The indicators of an approaching escalation in
the conflict beyond Ukraine are likely to fall into three categories.

The first indicators that political and military conditions are
increasing the risk of broader conflict include a breakdown in channels
of communication with Moscow. The absence of active diplomatic ties
would preclude a negotiated resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. An
end to U.S.-Russian military-to-military channels would undermine any
effort to avoid direct military conflict between the two countries.
Another indicator would be major insurgent successes that dramatically
increase Russian casualties. Moscow would be tempted to move more
aggressively against insurgent safe havens rather than capitulate on
what it considers to be its vital interest in Ukraine.

Second are the indicators that Moscow is preparing for a broader
conflict, which it would undoubtedly argue had been forced by Western
actions. Such signs include Kremlin efforts to prepare the Russian
public for a wider conflict, which could entail official statements,
greater media focus on escalating Western "aggression," an increased
pace of civil defense drills, and mobilization of reserves. Another
indicator includes the massing of Russian forces in the Baltic region.
It could include such moves as aggressive hybrid actions to destabilize
Poland and the Baltic states, coupled with efforts to rally indigenous
ethnic Russian communities against their governments.

Third are the indicators that Moscow is intentionally seeking to widen
the conflict. This could include greater support for Bosnian Serb leader
Dodik, such as diplomatic and financial backing, and provision of
weapons. They could also encourage Serb leaders to more assertively
pursue their grievances against Kosovo.

Implications for the United States

[A wider European conflict would pose the stiffest challenge to the
**global standing of the**]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [since the end of the Cold War and to the
international system it has built and underwritten for decades
longer]{.underline}. [It would test the durability of its global system
of alliances and the efficacy of international regimes and institutions
that have guarded world peace, security, and prosperity.]{.underline}
The challenge would come at a time when the United States itself is in
immense disarray, as a deeply polarized polity confronts massive
domestic problems---the pandemic, inflation, racial justice, and
cultural wars---that leave less time and fewer resources for foreign
matters. The United States will be tested to see whether it can muster
the will, energy, and creativity to execute an effective policy toward
the unfolding crisis in Europe.

At home, public attention has been focused on developments in and around
Ukraine, but the Joe Biden administration cannot ignore the home front.
In response to U.S.-levied sanctions, Russia can be expected to step up
its cyber operations against the United States. It will more actively
sow disinformation, seek to exacerbate domestic tensions, and paralyze
critical infrastructure. The severity of the attacks will likely rise in
proportion to the harshness of the sanctions Washington levies on
Moscow.

Abroad, the fate of the transatlantic community, a central pillar of
U.S. security and prosperity, would be a stake. One of the Biden
administration's priorities, as laid out in the Interim National
Security Strategy Guidance released in March 2021, is repairing U.S.
alliances---especially with Europe---after four disruptive years under
President Donald Trump. Although relations are more cordial, significant
substantive differences remain and the willingness of allies to align
behind a common purpose for the long haul remains questionable.

[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates'
[allies have rallied behind a harsh set of sanctions in
response]{.underline} to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [but preserving
unity as the conflict drags on remains a challenge]{.underline},
especially if sacrifice is spread unevenly across NATO, as will most
likely be the case. [Putin will seek to **exploit divisions**
through]{.underline} differentiated levels of pressure on NATO members,
[targeted energy cutoffs, offers of negotiation]{.underline}, and the
like to advance two long-standing Russian goals: the end of NATO as a
collective defense organization and the erosion of the foundations of
the EU. Should he succeed, the new order that would emerge in Europe is
far from certain. But Russia would undoubtedly play a central role in
its formulation, and almost any conceivable new order would diminish the
power and role of the United States on the continent.

A similar situation obtains in the Indo-Pacific region. The Biden
administration spent 2021 bolstering relations with its allies and
partners---energizing the Quad (the United States, Australia, India, and
Japan), and cutting a submarine deal with the United Kingdom and
Australia---to meet the growing strategic challenge posed by China. [A
major, prolonged European distraction could undo further efforts to
pivot to Asia, **raise doubts among allies** and partners about the
**credibility of the U.S. commitment**, and **free China to pursue its
objectives** with greater vigor.]{.underline} The United States could
avoid this outcome by pursuing lesser goals in Europe---leading to the
quicker development of a new order less favorable to American
interests---or by a massive buildup of its military capabilities that
would enable it to play a major, perhaps decisive, role in both regions.
The latter would have to come at the cost of the Biden administration's
domestic priorities. Whether the Biden administration could muster
sufficient domestic political support, if it decided to move in this
direction, is far from certain.

In addition to regional challenges, a major European conflict would also
stress critical international regimes and institutions. One of the first
victims would likely be the arms control regime that has served as the
foundation of strategic nuclear stability for the past fifty-plus years.
The United States withdrew from some central elements---including the
Anti-Ballistic Missiles (ABM) and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(INF) treaties---but two critical elements have remained in place: the
New START treaty and the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). A wider conflict
in Europe would all but guarantee that the United States and Russia
could not agree to a follow-on treaty to the New START treaty before it
expires in 2026, and the NPT review conference tentatively scheduled for
August 2022 would fall by the wayside. As a consequence, the incipient
arms race now underway, fueled by new technologies---hypersonics, cyber
tools, and artificial intelligence---would accelerate. [A new wave of
nuclear proliferation could ensue, especially if U.S. allies and
partners lose faith in America's commitment to extended
deterrence.]{.underline} [Mutually assured destruction,
which]{.underline} for better or worse [has **anchored strategic
stability** since the early]{.underline} 19[70s]{.underline}, [would be
severely stressed in a multipolar nuclear landscape with Russia and
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[fighting at least a proxy war]{.underline}.

Likewise, a broader conflict in Europe would stress, perhaps to the
breaking point, the United Nations and many of its auxiliary
organizations. Already stymied by a growing rift between the Western
permanent members and Russia and China, the Security Council would have
failed in its primary reason for being---to prevent the outbreak of a
major conflict in Europe. It could continue to exist as a forum for the
airing of grievances and acrimonious debate, but it would serve little
purpose as a platform for addressing major global issues.

Finally, the humanitarian costs of a wider conflict in Europe would be
staggering, particularly given the destructiveness of modern weapons.
Beyond the physical destruction and loss of life, untold numbers of
refugees would flow across borders not only into Central East Europe but
perhaps further West depending on the scale of the fighting. The strain
on the socioeconomic systems---coming on top of the stress of the
two-year-old pandemic, economic dislocation, and mounting
inflation---could bring some close to collapse.

Preventive Options

U.S. policy toward Russia has traditionally been a combination of
deterrence and diplomacy. The Biden administration deployed both as it
tried to dissuade Russia from invading Ukraine. Both have a role to play
in reducing the risk of a wider European conflict, now that Russia has
invaded.

[Many of the steps that]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline}
administration [is now taking to counter Russia could be accelerated and
expanded to **deter it from expanding its military operations** beyond
that country]{.underline}. They would likely prove more effective due to
NATO's Article 5 collective defense guarantee, which does not apply to
Ukraine. The Biden administration could:

- [With its NATO allies, accelerate and expand its current augmentation
  of forces in vulnerable allies along the frontier with Russia to
  reassure them---and **convince Moscow---of the alliance's commitment**
  to collective defense.]{.underline}

- [Step up its already intensive schedule of **consultations with
  allies** to **maintain alliance unity** in the face of a burgeoning
  Russian threat.]{.underline}

- Develop a long-term plan to reduce Europe's dependence on imported
  Russian gas, building on the stopgap measures it is already putting in
  place to deal with a near-term decision by Moscow to stop flows of gas
  westward.

- *Consider cutting off energy imports from Russia, and asking the
  Europeans to do the same, but only after it has prepared the American
  public for the economic hardship (rising energy costs, inflation) such
  a step would entail.*

- *Accelerate efforts to harden American and allied critical
  infrastructure against cyber intrusions*.

### 1nc DA NATO Expansion 

#### Turkey can still be convinced to support NATO expansion but it will need to [cajoled]{.underline} and [persuaded]{.underline} \-\-- Erdogan needs to demonstrate a [strong standing with voters]{.underline} in the lead up to the election

**Aydıntaşbaş, 22 \-\-- Senior Policy Fellow at the European Council on
Foreign Relations** (16 May 2022, Asli Aydıntaşbaş, "Turkey, NATO, and
the Ukraine war: Why Erdogan's grievances are about more than Sweden and
Finland; The Turkish president is unlikely to veto Nordic membership of
NATO -- but Turkey's bigger strategic worry is of a NATO-Russia conflict
arising out of the war in Ukraine,"
<https://ecfr.eu/article/turkey-nato-and-the-ukraine-war-why-erdogans-grievances-are-about-more-than-sweden-and-finland/>,
JMP)

[Just when NATO members were about to pop the champagne in celebration
of Finland's and Sweden's applications to join]{.underline} the
alliance, the buzz-kill dropped: Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip
[Erdogan, declared]{.underline} on Friday that [he looks unfavourably on
the duo becoming members]{.underline}.

"We are following developments. We currently do not have a positive
\[favourable\] position on the issue of Sweden and Finland \[joining
NATO\]," Erdogan told reporters after Friday prayers in Istanbul.
"Scandinavian countries are like terrorist groups' guesthouses," he
continued, referring to the presence in Sweden of exiled Gulenists and
sympathisers of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) -- which Ankara views
as a terrorist organisation that has tentacles in Turkey, Syria, and
Iraq.

This was an obstacle in an otherwise well-choreographed Nordic march
into NATO. Was Erdogan trying to put pressure on the US Congress for
those F-16s that Ankara wants to purchase? Was this really about more
money for Syrian refugees in Turkey? Or did he really want Gulenists or
PKK sympathisers extradited to Turkey?

By Monday, Turkish officials had started floating the idea that they
wanted Sweden and Finland to show that they had stopped "supporting
terrorists" and lift export bans on Turkey.

[It is unlikely that Erdogan had one specific policy goal in mind, but
he will no doubt be expecting to be **cajoled**, **persuaded**, and
eventually **rewarded for his cooperation**, as in the
past.]{.underline} Over the weekend, [his spokesperson]{.underline},
Ibrahim [Kalin, walked back the idea of a Turkish veto by saying that
Ankara was **not "closing the door" on Nordic entry**]{.underline}, but
that it wanted a crackdown on terrorists' activities in Sweden.

Indeed, Erdogan's statement was expressed more as a complaint than as a
firm veto threat. And it may not be all about Sweden and Finland. [The
president almost certainly sees this as an opportune moment to air his
grievances about existing NATO members, especially]{.underline} with the
[Biden]{.underline} administration, which has kept the Turkish leader at
arm's length. In the long list of problems between Ankara and
Washington, a key item might be Erdogan's disappointment at being unable
to establish the type of presidential telephone line with Joe Biden as
he had with Donald Trump. "We had good relations with Obama and Trump
and had no problem talking. Have we achieved the same with Mr. Biden?
No, we haven't. That wasn't what we wanted," he recently lamented. [With
dwindling domestic support at a time when Turkey is entering a critical
electoral cycle, Erdogan is looking for a higher international profile
to **demonstrate his global importance to Turkish voters**.]{.underline}

Turkey's leader is a man who wears his emotions on his sleeve -- and he
almost certainly would have been upset at the recent news that
Washington has lifted sanctions on Syria's Kurdish-controlled (as well
as Turkish-controlled) regions, allowing the autonomous Kurdish
administration to trade with the outside world. Turkey views the
US-allied Kurdish administration in northern Syria, dominated by the
Syrian Democratic Forces, as an offshoot of the PKK and a threat on its
southern border. It is angry at Western support for Syrian Kurds.

For the past few years, [Ankara has criticised NATO for failing to be a
**reciprocal love-match**, a relationship that **overlooks Turkey's
security concerns** despites the country's decades of loyalty to the
alliance]{.underline}. And there are occasional bouts of friction with
NATO partners, most notably with Greece and France over issues such as
eastern Mediterranean maritime borders and overflights in the Aegean.
The Turkish air force has recently pulled out of a military exercise in
Greece and tensions between the two countries are quietly brewing
regarding the Aegean.

In addition, Turkey's position on Nordic entry to NATO is in line with
its balancing act between NATO and Russia. While selling armed drones to
Kyiv and supporting Ukraine's sovereignty, Ankara has been reluctant to
sever relations with Moscow and it has stayed away from Western economic
sanctions. It may be using this to signal its decoupling from Western
actions on Ukraine.

Senior Turkish officials are quietly concerned that the conflict is now
turning into a NATO-Russia war and that the risk of escalation is
growing, fuelled by greater arms support for Ukraine and the absence of
a negotiations framework. They are also disappointed with the West's
reluctance to rally behind Turkish-brokered ceasefire talks. High-level
Turkish officials have accused "some NATO countries" of not wanting the
war to end in order to harm Russia.

Meanwhile, Sweden is an easy pick for any Turkish leader, but especially
one in an alliance with nationalists at home. Swedish foreign policy's
focus on human rights, gender equality, and diversity is almost anathema
to the male-dominated, conservative political culture in Erdogan's
Justice and Development Party. Within the European Union, Swedes have
championed a human rights-based approach in relations with Turkey --
which has annoyed Ankara for years. As the divide between Stockholm and
Ankara widened, Turkey's foreign minister, Mevlüt Cavusoglu, got into a
public spat with the Swedish foreign minister Ann Linde in 2020,
accusing her of double standards and of lecturing Turkey on human
rights. A senior Western diplomat told me that the mood at this
weekend's NATO meeting was similar.

The irony is that Turkey is one of NATO's oldest members, but, since the
breakup of the Soviet Union, it has been an enthusiastic champion of
enlargement. Turkey has traditionally supported countries that now
comprise NATO's eastern flank -- from Poland and Hungary to Albania and
North Macedonia -- to enter the alliance. It has also developed strong
military partnerships with states on the periphery, such as Ukraine,
Georgia, and Azerbaijan.

But that was then, and this is now.

Europe's strategic landscape is changing fast, and Turkey, increasingly
seeing itself as a friendless loner, does not want to be caught in
crossfire.

[**In all likelihood**, Erdogan will **soften his stance** in the coming
weeks following pleas from NATO partners.]{.underline} A call from Joe
Biden would help, but so too would addressing other issues, such the EU
agreeing to expedite the new tranche of its migration deal with Turkey,
or lift some of its export restrictions on Turkey's defence industry.

What would not change is the overall view in Ankara -- that this
conflict is heading in the wrong direction and that, despite the
self-congratulatory mood among NATO partners, the risk of a wider
escalation emerging from this grinding war is greater than ever.

#### U.S.-Turkey relations are [transactional]{.underline} \-\-- only [prioritizing]{.underline}, and [compromising]{.underline} through [prior consultation]{.underline} can ensure cooperation

JMP

For all the problems bedeviling their ties, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [and Turkey's
interests will]{.underline} still [be better served by cooperation than
**antagonism**]{.underline}. While nostalgia for the U.S.-Turkey

the only alternative is enmity. [For all of the serious disputes
dividing them, Americans and Turks share an interest in limiting Russian
influence in the region, countering Iranian adventurism, and preventing
nuclear and missile proliferation]{.underline}

[Yet the reality is that for the foreseeable future, even if the
U.S.-Turkey relationship can be stabilized, it will be **more

#### \*\*\*Insert Specific Link\*\*\*

#### NATO expansion key to [European]{.underline} and [Asian]{.underline} stability \-\-- limits further invasion in Europe by Russia 

**Mitchell, 22 -- senior advisor for the Russia and Europe Center at
USIP** \[A. Wess, May 26,United States Institute of Peace,

Acc 6/23/22, HO\]

[How would Finland's and Sweden's NATO accession impact the geopolitics
of Europe?]{.underline} Would it ultimately boost European security?

The United States should always be judicious about adding new treaty
allies --- it's a serious thing indeed to widen the U.S. global
defensive perimeter. In the case of Finland and Sweden, [I see the
impact as positive; their accession will round off NATO geographically
and **improve Europe's defensibility in a crisis**.]{.underline} We
should be clear that both [Sweden and Finland]{.underline} will need to
step up defense spending, along with the rest of Europe. But [both have
**serious, professional militaries** with **specialized capabilities**
and a long track record of partnering with NATO. Finland has a serious
defensive capability, including one of the largest artillery forces in
Europe, and nationwide participation in the reserves like the Swiss or
Israeli model. Their long border with Russia is dotted with thousands of
lakes and is very defensible, as we saw in the 1930s Winter War. Sweden
brings significant naval and especially anti-submarine
capabilities.]{.underline}

[The main positive]{.underline} however [is geographic and
strategic]{.underline} in nature --- [bringing these states into NATO
will **significantly mitigate the alliance's biggest military
vulnerability**, which is the exposed geography of the Baltic
States]{.underline}. If you look at a map, the Baltic States form an
exposed salient in the northeastern corner of the Alliance. It would
probably be hard to get reinforcements to them in a crisis. [Adding
Finland and Sweden to NATO mitigates that vulnerability and makes the
Baltic States a much less inviting target. It complicates the Russian
theory of victory in the Baltic]{.underline}, which has centered on
creating a fait accompli by grabbing a strip of territory and then
waiting for NATO to try to get enough troops to the region to evict
them. [Adding Finland and Sweden to NATO makes the Baltics less
isolated, more defensible and easier to support in a crisis, which in
turn probably makes Russia less likely to attack them in the first
place, and therefore makes war less likely.]{.underline}

[NATO accession also removes some unhelpful ambiguity about Finland and
Sweden themselves.]{.underline} We saw in 1914 with Belgium how
ambiguity about whether and how to defend a neutral can increase the
calculation for war on the part of an aggressor. [Prior to them joining
NATO, how to respond if Russia were to attack one of these two states
would have been a difficult question for the United States]{.underline}.
That very ambiguity could invite the war we want to avoid. [NATO
membership removes that ambiguity. It also allows us the incorporation
of Finland and Sweden into NATO contingency planning.]{.underline}

[Adding these two]{.underline} countries [to NATO is also a good thing
from the perspective of **U.S. global strategy**]{.underline}.
Washington has to look at Europe not in isolation but alongside the
reality of U.S. commitments in the Indo-Pacific. [It's in America's
interest for Europe to be as defensible, uninviting to aggression and
defensively capable as possible to **assure the stability of Asia as
well**.]{.underline} To my mind, [adding serious, security-minded
players like Finland and Sweden to NATO]{.underline}, along with
following through on the increased defense commitments that the war has
prompted, [aids in that goal]{.underline}.

## Uniqueness

### 2nc NATO Unity Now

#### Political unity and interoperability are strong now \-\-- key to deter Russia

for the Navy ROTC Unit serving Rutgers and Princeton Universities**
\[6/22, "NATO, Russia, and Competition for Strategic Influence in the

access date, 6/19/22 //TJ\]

[Russia continues to seek to **rebuild its influence** on the peripheral
states where it was once a hegemon. Russia's actions in Ukraine
demonstrate the threat, and]{.underline} President Vladimir [Putin's own
words show]{.underline} the [intent. NATO presently acts as an
**effective shield for allies**, with its tremendous political,
economic, and conventional advantages over Russia]{.underline}. Despite
these strengths, NATO must be mindful that Russia has its own asymmetric
advantages in a potential conflict in its near abroad.

[NATO has]{.underline} rightly [pursued a path to avoid
conflict]{.underline} with Russia [by **maintaining political unity as
well as military interoperability**]{.underline} [and readiness through
combined exercises and operations. NATO must **continue to maintain that
unity** and readiness to prevent Russian aggression.]{.underline} Should
deterrence fail, swift and credible action to demonstrate collective
commitment to NATO defense will be critical to successful defense of the
Baltic, and the health of the Alliance as a whole.

#### NATO is working together and strongly supporting Ukraine with resources

**Blinken, 22 -- US Secretary of State** \[Antony J., Jens; 6/1/22;
"Secretary Antony J. Blinken And NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg At a
Joint Press Availability";

[We'll strengthen our relationships with the European Union]{.underline}
and with partners in the Indo-Pacific. We will [bolster NATO's
budget]{.underline}. And we will [renew our Alliance's defense and
deterrence capabilities]{.underline}. Of course, the strategic concept
will reflect what we are now dealing with, and that is a new security
landscape in Europe and President Putin's decision to launch a senseless
war of aggression on Ukraine, now in its fourth month.

The [people of Ukraine continue to fight with]{.underline} extraordinary
courage and skill and with [military, humanitarian, and financial
support from the United States and countries around the world, including
virtually all of the members of NATO.]{.underline} Just this morning
President Biden announced a significant new security assistance package
to arm Ukraine with additional capabilities in advanced weaponry,
precisely what they need to defend themselves against the ongoing
Russian aggression. That includes more advanced rocket systems so that
they can strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine from longer
distances. This is a continuation of a strategy that began even before
Russia's invasion. We [moved quickly to send Ukraine significant amounts
of weapons and ammunition so]{.underline} that they can repel Russia's
aggression and, in turn, [can be in the strongest possible position at
any negotiating table that may emerge.]{.underline}

[This isn't only the commitment of the United States]{.underline}. As I
said, [all NATO Allies **remain engaged, aligned, committed** to
ensuring that Ukraine can protect its sovereignty, its democracy, its
independence]{.underline}. Our countries, along with other partners,
imposed severe consequences on the Russian Government and its enablers
with unprecedented sanctions, export controls, and diplomatic pressure.
Together we responded to the humanitarian crisis provoked by Russia's
war of aggression. More than 6 million Ukrainians forced to leave their
homeland, many others displaced within Ukraine. Countries across Europe
and beyond, including the United States, have welcomed Ukrainians
fleeing the violence. And countries worldwide are helping provide
essential services to communities close to Ukraine that have taken on
the most refugees.

President [Putin]{.underline} hoped that his war on Ukraine would divide
NATO. Instead, [he's united NATO in support of Ukraine and in defense of
its own members]{.underline}. He's brought [countries around the world
together to support the fundamental principles of sovereignty and
independence]{.underline}. They see what's happening in Ukraine as a
direct result -- excuse me, a direct assault on the foundation of their
own peace and security. That is why we will continue to stand with a
democratic, independent, sovereign Ukraine until this terrible war is
over, and for that matter, long after.

[NATO]{.underline} will be [prepared to face challenges
like]{.underline} these [with secure cyber defenses, cutting-edge
technology, and enhanced partnerships,]{.underline} as I said, with
countries around the world. We'll make sure that we [defend every inch
of NATO territory]{.underline}. [The Allies have reinforced our
**collective defense posture**.]{.underline} Since the war began, we've
deployed more than 20,000 additional troops to NATO's eastern flank.

#### US-NATO relations strong -- Ukraine war proves unity

**Blinken and Stoltenberg, 22 -- US Secretary of State and the NATO
Secretary General** \[Antony J., Jens; 6/1/22; "Secretary Antony J.
Blinken And NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg At a Joint Press
Availability";

accessed 6/21/22; Lowell-DC\]

And let me just also, if I could, before I turn it over to Jens, I do
want to say one thing about the question that you addressed to the
Secretary General. Here again, [at every stage of this Russian
aggression]{.underline} -- before the aggression, when it started, and
in the months since -- at virtually every stage we have heard [doubts
expressed about what the Alliance would do]{.underline}, what countries
would do in terms of support for Ukraine, and whether that was actually
going to happen. [We have demonstrated that it would, and that it has;
concerns and doubts about whether we could really deliver on what we
said we would do -- massive consequences for Russia's aggression with
unprecedented sanctions]{.underline}. Well, we've delivered on that. And
I would suggest that there are always going to be stories about
differences in any particular moment.

But when it comes to the [strategic direction]{.underline} that we have
[taken together as Allies]{.underline}, [as partners, both within Europe
and beyond,]{.underline} this, at least in my experience, has been
[**unprecedented in its solidarity** in the common
determination]{.underline} both to support Ukraine with [security
assistance, economic assistance, humanitarian assistance, to put
extraordinary pressure on Russia]{.underline} to cease its aggression,
and to shore up the defenses of our Alliance.

And so, again, I'd invite you to go back, look at the questions that
were raised starting last fall. They've been answered -- then again,
when Russia committed the aggression in the first place, and even to
this day. And I am very confident that the common purpose that we've
shown over many months will continue.

SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: I can just follow up on that, because
what [you have seen over the last months]{.underline} is [an
**unprecedented level of unity among NATO Allies**]{.underline} and
partners in the response to Russia's aggressive war against Ukraine. We
have seen that when it comes to the provision of military support,
humanitarian support, economic support, but also the -- in the way we
have seen [NATO Allies, partners, the European Union implementing heavy
economic sanctions]{.underline}, sanctions we have not seen anything
similar to imposed on any major country ever before. So actually, what
we have seen is an unprecedented level of unity among NATO Allies and
partners.

Of course, these are difficult decisions, hard decisions, and therefore
there is a need for consultations, and therefore I would also like to
commend the United States for consulting so closely with Allies not only
after invasion on the 24th of February, but actually before. [The United
States consulted closely, Secretary Blinken consulted closely with
NATO]{.underline} Allies throughout the autumn. [We warned, we shared
intelligence]{.underline}. There's hardly any other military invasion
that has been more predicted than this one, and that not least because
the [United States shared so much intelligence with NATO Allies in the
months leading up to the invasion in February]{.underline}.

European allies -- of course, as the United States -- have imposed
sanctions. They have a price also for us. They are hosting millions of
refugees. But the alternative not to support Ukraine, that will actually
enable President Putin to win. That will be dangerous for all of us, and
the price we have to pay will actually be higher than to now invest in
the support for Ukraine.

Let me end by saying that President [Putin]{.underline} made a strategic
mistake. He totally underestimated the strength and the will and the
ability of the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian armed forces to defend
themselves, and he [underestimated the unity of NATO and NATO Allies and
partners to support Ukraine.]{.underline} And again, what we see is U.S.
leadership helping this to happen, both on the political-diplomatic
level, but also when it comes to organizing and coordinating the
military support through the Support Group for Ukraine.

President [Biden]{.underline} on Monday [voiced his support for Finland
and Sweden]{.underline} applying [to join]{.underline} the
[NATO]{.underline} alliance [and]{.underline} said he [would work with
Congress and other member nations to "quickly" approve their
membership]{.underline}.

"Sweden and Finland have made the important decision to seek NATO
membership after thorough and inclusive democratic processes in each
country," Biden said in a statement.

The alliance has become a focal point of international discussion in the
months since Russia invaded Ukraine. [Article 5 of the NATO treaty
states that an attack on one member will be interpreted as an attack on
all members, providing some protection for neighboring nations of
Ukraine such as Poland.]{.underline}

[Others in the region, including Sweden and Finland, have pushed to join
the alliance in hopes of providing a **stronger defense against the
threat of Russian aggression** should Moscow choose to expand its
offensive.]{.underline}

Both countries have announced in recent days that they are seeking NATO
membership, and Biden will host Finnish President Sauli Niinistö and
Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson at the White House on
Thursday to discuss the issue.

"NATO guarantees the security of 1 billion people in Europe and North
America --- united by our shared commitment to democratic principles and
our vision of peace and prosperity in Europe and around the world. And
my commitment to NATO and Article 5 is ironclad," Biden said.

"While their applications for NATO membership are being considered, the
United States will work with Finland and Sweden to remain vigilant
against any threats to our shared security, and to deter and confront
aggression or the threat of aggression," the president added, calling
the two nations "stalwart partners of the United States."

convene the meeting in a few days with senior officials and then follow
up to ensure that we make progress on the applications of Finland and
Sweden to join NATO. My intention is to have this in place before the
NATO summit. At the same time, I know that to make progress we need 30
Allies to agree.

[Finland and Sweden]{.underline} has made -- have made it clear that
they [are ready to]{.underline} sit down and to [address the concerns
expressed by Turkey]{.underline}. And [all NATO Allies]{.underline} are
of course [ready to sit down and address those concerns]{.underline},
including the threats posed to Turkey by PKK. And this is terrorist
threats, which of course is something we are taking very seriously. We
know that no other NATO Ally has suffered more terrorist attacks than
Turkey. And [Turkey is an important Ally]{.underline}, not least because
of its strategic geographic location bordering Iraq and Syria. They have
been [important in our fight against ISIS, and also Black Sea country,
close to Russia.]{.underline}

So all of this makes Turkey an important Ally. When they raise concerns,
of course, we sit down and we look into how we can find the united way
forward.

MR PRICE: We'll take a final question from Stefan Asberg of SVT Sweden.

QUESTION: Secretary Blinken, two questions. Specifically what is the
U.S. willing to do to facilitate the negotiations between Turkey,
Sweden, and Finland?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Were there two questions?

MR PRICE: Please, go ahead.

QUESTION: I kind of want to ask one a time.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: One at a time. Okay. Thank you. You've heard from the
secretary general [Finland and Sweden are working directly with
Turkey]{.underline}. [NATO]{.underline} is [supporting this
effort]{.underline}. The secretary general will bring the parties
together. We very much support those efforts. There is [a strong
consensus within NATO broadly for the rapid accession of Sweden and
Finland to the Alliance]{.underline}. I remain very confident that that
will happen, that we're going to move forward. As I've said before,
[this is a process]{.underline}, and in that process, [if Allies have
concerns, they raise them and then we deal with them. NATO is dealing
with them]{.underline}. But in particular, [concerns that Turkey has
raised directly]{.underline} with Finland and Sweden are being
[addressed]{.underline} by the Fins and the Swedes with the assistance
of NATO. We want to make sure that all Allies have their security
concerns taken into account, and that, of course, includes Turkey, but
I'm confident this process will move forward.

QUESTION: Are U.S. willing to export fighter jets to Turkey, for
instance, to easen up the situation?

SECRETARY BLINKEN: These are separate questions. We have a longstanding
and ongoing defense relationship with Turkey as a NATO Ally. And as we
have in the past, as we're doing now, as we will in the future, we'll
continue to work through cases as they arise with regard to systems that
Turkey seeks to acquire.

QUESTION: And Secretary Stoltenberg, [how confident are you that Turkey
will approve Sweden and Finland]{.underline}?

SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: [**I'm confident** that we will find a
way forward]{.underline}. And I am confident because [all Allies agree
that NATO enlargement has been a great success]{.underline}, helping to
[spread democracy, freedom across Europe for decades]{.underline}. And
therefore we [need to sit down]{.underline}, as [we always do when there
are different views in NATO]{.underline}, and [find a way to go forward
together]{.underline}. So this is not the first time in NATO that some
Allies expressed concerns, that there are some differences, some
disagreements, but we have a [long track record in NATO also to be able
to overcome those differences and then agree on how to move
forward.]{.underline}

### AT: Turkey Won't Every Support

#### Turkey's opposition is not insurmountable \-\-- analysts predict they could change their mind

**Turak, 22 \-- CNBC correspondent** (5/17/22, Natasha 'The stakes here
are now massive': Turkey is threatening to block NATO membership for
Sweden and Finland.
<https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/17/will-turkey-block-nato-membership-for-sweden-and-finland.html>)
//AB

"The stakes here are now massive," Timothy Ash, emerging markets
strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, said in a note Tuesday. "It
feels like a major crisis is looming in Turkey-Western relations over
Finland and Sweden's NATO bid."

["Other NATO members will be furious with Turkey given the now clear and
present danger to Europe presented by Putin]{.underline} in Ukraine,"
Ash added. ["Turkey will be seen an an unreliable partner. This will
leave even more bad blood]{.underline}/faith between the two sides ---
gone will be any remnants of a Turkish EU accession bid."

Turkey's highly strategic Incirlik air base is home to 50 of the U.S.′
tactical nuclear weapons, which some U.S. officials have suggested
removing due to increasing tensions with Washington and Ankara in recent
years. Those tensions were centered partly on Erdogan's warming ties
with Russian President [Vladimir
Putin](https://www.cnbc.com/vladimir-putin/) and its controversial
decision to purchase Russia's S-400 air defense system, which saw it
kicked out of NATO's F-35 program.

While [Turkey]{.underline} has supported Ukraine by sending it weapons,
in particular its lethal Bayraktar drones, and has tried to mediate
between Moscow and Kyiv, it [has so far refused to join its NATO allies
in sanctioning Russia.]{.underline}

Some analysts are skeptical of Erdogan's tough talk, convinced he won't
actually block the NATO membership bids --- rather, they predict he will
simply use his country's leverage to extract concessions and boost his
own waning popularity at home.

["Despite its objections, Ankara will not block the countries' entry
into NATO," analysts at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group
wrote]{.underline} in a research note late Monday.

"Erdogan is likely looking for concessions for green-lighting NATO's
expansion, mainly from Sweden. These might include the easing of
Stockholm's bilateral arms embargo on Turkey and some recognition of PKK
as a terrorist organization to curtail its fund-raising and recruitment
activities," the note said.

[Erdogan's top foreign policy advisor, Ibrahim Kalin, over the weekend
reassured allies by saying in an interview with Reuters: "**We are not
closing the door.**]{.underline} But we are basically raising this issue
as a matter of national security for Turkey," concerning NATO accession
for Sweden and Finland.

[GOP senators]{.underline} who opposed new Ukraine aid [are eager to

Finland's and Sweden]{.underline}'s bids [to join NATO]{.underline}.

[Senators in both parties are already taking steps **to fast-track a
defense treaty** for the two countries' memberships in the
alliance]{.underline}, as the U.S. and its allies look to strengthen
their posture against Russia and send a message of unity to Russian
President Vladimir Putin. As a result, both bids are on a glide path to
the required two-thirds Senate approval.

According to nearly a dozen interviews with senators, [most of the
Republicans who opposed new military aid to Ukraine are unlikely to
block Finland's and Sweden's bids to join NATO --- further easing the
bipartisan push amid concerns that some Republicans were growing uneasy
with the U.S. commitment to Europe's security]{.underline}.

"That's one of the prices that Putin should pay. ... The more the
merrier that we get into NATO," said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), who was
among the 11 conservatives who opposed the \$40 billion Ukraine aid
package due to the high price tag. "It strengthens them and puts less of
a burden on us. I'm for anybody who wants to join."

"We'll welcome them both with open arms," added Sen. Roger Marshall
(R-Kan.), who also opposed the aid bill but said he would vote "without
hesitation" in favor of their NATO bids.

The two countries' bids to become the 31st and 32nd members of NATO
highlight the irony of Putin's war in Ukraine: The Russian leader
unintentionally hardened the alliance --- and possibly expanded it. To
drive that message home, Senate Armed Services Chair Jack Reed (D-R.I.)
said, "there's a sense of trying to move very quickly" on the treaty
process.

"[It needs to happen fast]{.underline}," added Sen. Steve Daines
(R-Mont.), who traveled to Ukraine last month. "[It should be
unanimous]{.underline}. It's important in this moment in history that
[the United States Senate stands firmly with our NATO allies and those
who seek to join]{.underline} NATO."

In a Feb. 26 Twitter post, Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's vice prime
minister and minister for digital transformation, asked the SpaceX chief
executive, Elon Musk, to provide Ukraine with Starlink terminals to
enable satellite-based communications. In less than 48 hours, Starlink
user kits arrived in Ukraine, immediately improving the
command-and-control ability of Ukraine's military.

[For those of us who study the NATO acquisition process, it is almost
impossible to imagine the alliance identifying a requirement and
adopting a solution so quickly, **no matter how urgent** the
circumstances]{.underline}. [Among the **many challenges** would be the
**alliance's elaborate, consensus-based governing structure**, as well
as the **divergent interests and funding mechanisms** among the 30
member states]{.underline}. This is why, in 2016, the International
Board of Auditors concluded [that NATO struggles to provide commanders
with required capabilities on time and estimated that common-funded
capabilities required an average of **16 years from development to
delivery**.]{.underline}

[The **complexity of modern weapons systems** and the challenges of
interoperability mean that any active engagement will lead to the
identification of new technical requirements for NATO]{.underline}. The
alliance needs the processes and structures in place to rapidly identify
these requirements and procure solutions. This includes giving
commanders the authority to make decisions without the lengthy
consensus-building approach that may be reasonable, if slow, in
peacetime but is not effective during war.

First Steps

NATO has previously sought to improve the governance, speed, and
efficiency of its capability-delivery process. For example, in 2018 NATO
adopted a new governance model for common-funded capabilities. It has
undertaken efforts to enhance collaboration between strategic commands
(Allied Command Operations in Mons, Belgium and Allied Command
Transformation in Norfolk, VA), called for the exploration of
alternative acquisition strategies to support technology development,
and created the Office of the Chief Information Officer to accelerate
the delivery of computer and information systems. Furthermore, in
October 2021 NATO launched the first \$1.1 billion Innovation Fund, and
last month announced the creation of the first ever Defense Innovation
Accelerator for the North Atlantic to harness cutting-edge technologies
as part of the NATO 2030 agenda.

These are valuable steps, but they do not address the fundamental
challenge of rapidly acquiring common capabilities. There are still many
residual processes where [consensus-based control is inherently
prioritized over speed, flexibility, innovation, and the deployment of
prototypes at the end of their development phases.]{.underline}

NATO leaders recognize the ongoing challenge. In a recent speech to the
North Atlantic Council, the supreme allied commander transformation,
Gen. Philippe Lavigne, stressed that one of his key priorities is to
ensure the timely delivery of new and critical capabilities, adding that
"we need to change the rules and make them work for us, not against us."
But [NATO leaders cannot fix this alone --- the alliance's 30 member
nations are the ones that will have to agree on the solution.
**Exploring alternatives and getting the allies to agree on a solution
will be difficult.**]{.underline} It can happen on a NATO-wide basis, or
some subset of member nations can take on the challenge and lead the
effort, which may then be adopted by others.

What Works

Access to adequate funding is a necessary starting point, and NATO has a
track record of funding common capabilities. In 2021, NATO was
implementing over 3,000 common-funded projects, worth approximately \$17
billion (of which the United States funds about 22 percent). These
include providing critical technology that supports the planning and
execution of all NATO air operations, and the Air Situation Data
Exchange that enhances situational awareness at NATO's borders with
partner nations, including Ukraine.

But the [capability-fielding process is still **subject to delays**,
which would be dangerous when addressing needs identified during combat
operations. To avoid this, alliance members should commit to providing
funds for a rapid-acquisition organization on a preauthorized and
discretionary basis]{.underline}, in essence creating a bank account
that can be drawn upon when needed. Even if this were a credit line that
members committed to, rather than a standing pot of funds, it would
limit setbacks caused by the slow and political processes of identifying
and appropriating funding.

[Ensuring adequate funding is not the only answer. Commanders also need
the authority to streamline the identification of urgent needs and a
standing mechanism, not an ad hoc approach, that can provide the
flexibility and authority to address them.]{.underline} This exists for
some alliance members on a national basis. The commander of the Dutch
Defense Materiel Organization's Computer Emergency Response Team, for
example, has a pre-authorized budget and the power to expedite
acquisitions of up to 500,000 euros for urgent cyber capabilities within
14 days. [However, there is no NATO-wide approach.]{.underline}

The U.S. Department of Defense offers a variety of acquisition
approaches that NATO could draw from. The United States has a model
where the military services are largely responsible for acquiring weapon
systems and providing them to the joint force commanders. There are also
several Department of Defense organizations that have been stood up to
address cross-service challenges. This means that there are both joint
department-wide and service-level acquisition organizations procuring
materiel to serve as examples.

Over time, the Department of Defense has developed processes to allow
requirements identified on the battlefield to be quickly addressed.
Different parts of the department have also embarked on different forms
of organizational innovation.

One example is the Air Force's Rapid Capabilities Office, which was
formed in 2003 to "expedite important, often classified programs while
keeping them on budget." The office has a unique management structure
--- it reports to a board of directors that is chaired by the
undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment and includes
the most senior leaders of the Air Force and the under secretary of
defense for research and engineering. These senior leaders can both set
priorities for spending and work to find the necessary funding.
Furthermore, acquisition experts at the Rapid Capabilities Office are
carefully selected to maintain a culture where "lean, agile, and
forward-looking technology development" is possible. Along with the Air
Force's new stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, the office oversees the
X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle, "an experimental test program to demonstrate
technologies for a reliable, reusable, unmanned space test platform."
The effectiveness of the Rapid Capabilities Office is affirmed by the
decision to put these two extremely important programs there rather than
within more traditional Air Force acquisition organizations.

Another concept comes from the Defense Innovation Unit, which was
designed to work across the Department of Defense to identify and
understand critical national security challenges that can be solved with
leading-edge commercial technology within 12 to 24 months. The Defense
Innovation Unit connects with non-traditional suppliers in innovation
hubs, including Silicon Valley, and uses flexible acquisition models to
issue contracts in as little as 2 to 3 months. It then publishes a
catalog of commercial "solutions" ready for purchase from a range of
companies, many of whom are not traditional defense suppliers. These
include the Next Gen Explosive Ordnance Disposal Underwater Response
Vehicle, a remotely operated underwater vehicle that searches for mines,
and Hunt Forward, a set of tools for forward-deployed cyber operations.
Although implementation has not always been smooth, the Defense
Innovation Unit has nonetheless provided battlefield commanders with a
range of innovative solutions that they can turn to.

The Rapid Capabilities Office empowers its leadership to finalize
requirements and rapidly commit funding, a crucial component of its
success. The Defense Innovation Unit focuses on creating a pipeline of
new technologies. And these organizations are not unique. There are
others across the services, such as NAVALX, the Army Applications Lab,
and AFWERX, that are aimed at adapting innovations from both traditional
and non-traditional suppliers. The United Kingdom's Royal Air Force has
its own Rapid Capabilities Office, which has also shown promise.

These U.S. models prove that a bureaucracy as resistant to change as the
Department of Defense can still develop new organizational structures
and processes. The Dutch and British models show that attempts at
organizational innovation are not limited to the Pentagon. NATO may
choose to adapt one of these or to develop its own unique approaches.
The goal should be to provide its commanders with the flexibility and
the authority to "validate requirements" --- that is, to formally
approve what the warfighter needs to execute the fight --- and to make
resources available. The decision structure could be a small rotating
board of senior leaders, perhaps with time limits for approving or
rejecting requirements to force rapid decisions.

NATO also needs a way to connect with industry partners across the
alliance, capitalizing on innovations from small businesses and startups
using new and flexible contracting mechanisms. The alliance currently
lacks the tools to rapidly adopt commercial technologies. Two related
policies would help to enhance the ability of new technologies to
connect with existing systems. To increase operational effectiveness,
NATO should leverage interoperability standards that allow different
systems to operate seamlessly in a multi-domain environment. A related
approach would be to adopt open systems architecture approaches for NATO
weapons. This would provide design information to companies for
developing components that could work with existing systems using a
"plug and play" approach. Both of these policies would build upon the
traditional NATO strength of developing standards while making these
standards relevant to innovative companies.

[**All these process changes and organizational innovations will take
effort** --- and the **journey may be slowed by NATO's
consensus-building** culture. Transformation takes time, but it only
begins when there is a clear case for change]{.underline}. The scale and
scope of Russia's attack on Ukraine provides that case, and the delivery
of Starlink provides an example of what could be possible if NATO had a
more flexible approach to acquisitions.

### 2nc Link -- Game Theory

#### Allies [misrepresent]{.underline} their [actual]{.underline} preference to gain [leverage]{.underline}, but [overshoot]{.underline}, producing [gridlock]{.underline}

Dr. Ping-Kuei **Chen 16**, Doctor of Philosophy in Government and
Politics from the University of Maryland, \"Holding Hands While Parting
Ways: Examining Alliance Treaty Renegotiation\", Doctoral Dissertation,
2016,
https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/18546/Chen_umd_0117E_17257.pdf?sequence=1

[[During bargaining, alliance members]{.mark} interact and
**[communicate]{.mark} their [demands]{.mark}** [for **future security
coop**]{.mark}**eration**]{.underline}. [Allies not only try to
determine a set of mutually acceptable solutions, but also evaluate
whether the alliance is worth preserving.]{.underline} In the attempt to
find a solution to their differences, [members may encounter
difficulties during negotiation, since their [interests]{.mark} are
[**unlikely** to overlap]{.mark} completely.]{.underline}

Morrow (1994) suggests that two problems may hinder coordination in
alliance politics. [First, a distributional problem occurs when members
have different preferences among all available solutions]{.underline}.
[The other problem is **informational problem**]{.underline}. [Allies
may conceal available options from each other in order to advance their
own interests]{.underline}. These two problems intertwine. As Morrow
argues, "Distributional interests prevent the honest sharing of
information." This dictum applies to intra-alliance bargaining because,
even in a security alliance, members are not fully aware of each other's
intentions. Members sometimes have an incentive to misrepresent or hide
their true intent in terms of maximizing their own security benefit, and
so may withhold information regarding their security interests or
falling short of their commitments in order to achieve unexpressed
policy goals.

[These distributional and informational problems give rise to three
predicaments during intra-alliance bargaining: alliance members
may]{.underline} (1) [be]{.underline} **[unaware]{.underline}** [that
they have an interest divergence;]{.underline} (2) [acknowledge the
existence of interest divergence, but be uncertain about a mutually
acceptable solution;]{.underline} [or]{.underline} (3) [be unsure
whether other members will **keep their commitments** in the
future.]{.underline}

To overcome these difficulties, allies rely on information revealed
during intraalliance bargaining when deciding on the future of an
alliance. First, both sides need to recognize the existence of interest
divergence and the need for a solution. Bargaining needs to focus on
clarifying the problem when one or more partners fail even to see it,
and sometimes this act of clarification can in fact be the most
difficult discussion involved in bargaining.

Second, if both members recognize the interest divergence, they can move
on to negotiate an arrangement. [Successful bargaining requires **allies
to agree** on one among a set of mutually acceptable options. [A
**distributional problem** may occur]{.mark}, however, [when allies have
**uncertainties** regarding]{.mark} each other's **[updated]{.mark}
security [interests]{.mark}** and hence regarding what arrangements
might satisfy these interests]{.underline}. [Dialogue can clarify
matters, but [a member may become **suspicious** about]{.mark} the
[claims]{.mark} that an ally makes if these claims **differ from its own
reading** of the situation. Since an alliance relationship allows allies
to interact more frequently, each ally is confident of its own
understanding of the evolving security needs of its partners.
[When]{.mark} there is [a **perception gap**]{.mark} among members
concerning the security benefit that one or another enjoys or about the
kind of cooperation that best furthers the alliance's common interests,
[agreement may be **difficult**]{.mark} to reach]{.underline}. Allies
must genuinely communicate their own preferences and be able to verify
each other's claims.

Finally, members naturally want to know the extent to which the other
members value and are committed to the alliance. When their security
interests have changed, [they will not agree to negotiate **unless**
they still **consider each other reliable**]{.underline}. [When members
agree to revise a treaty, a major goal is to ensure that any new
obligations will **induce sustained cooperation**. An alliance will soon
**fall apart** if bargaining reveals that a member has no interest in
maintaining]{.underline} [it.]{.underline}

When allies are consistently candid during renegotiation, their
differences are likely to be resolved. However, as mentioned in the
context of studies of burden sharing, [allies have incentives to take
advantage of their partners that are founded on the assumption that the
interests of the latter in maintaining the alliance will lead them to
grant concessions during negotiations as a means to salvage the
imperiled relationship.]{.underline} In other words, [some members may
enter into renegotiation with the **belief** that abrogation would be
**too costly** for the other members]{.underline}. In addition, [an
uncommitted partner is **unlikely** to **engage** in negotiation and
more likely simply to **abandon the alliance immediately**]{.underline}.
A member that is willing to renegotiate, by contrast, still values and
therefore seeks to preserve the alliance. [[Each]{.mark} member thus
[starts bargaining under the assumption]{.mark} that the [others are
**unlikely to give up**]{.mark} easily, a situation [that leaves
rooms]{.mark} for allies [to **misrepresent**]{.mark} **their [security
interests]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} levels of
**[commitment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Even in an alliance relationship, a member's commitment to the alliance
is private information. Both the **[challenger and]{.mark} the
[partner]{.mark}** [have]{.mark} an [incentive to
**misrepresent**]{.mark} their true **[intent]{.mark}**ions [in]{.mark}
the [pursuit of **leverage**]{.mark} during bargaining. Expressing
discontent may gain concessions from other allies as well as testing the
loyalty of each]{.underline}. A challenger may, in the course of
renegotiation, threaten to withdraw from the alliance when it is in fact
willing to accept an arrangement; a partner may misjudge a challenger's
resolve and fail to accommodate its needs; a challenger may misperceive
its partner as dissatisfied and decide to withdraw from the alliance
preemptively. Therefore, even though intra-alliance bargaining stands a
good chance, and may represent the only chance, of resolving
disagreement among members, there is no guarantee that this process will
succeed.

### 2nc Link -- Consultation 

#### [Just informing]{.underline} NATO undermines cohesion \-\-- only [genuine consultation]{.underline} can limit tension among members

**Lorenz, 20** **\-\-- international security expert at the Polish
Institute of International Affairs** \[Wojciech, November, 2020,
"Strengthening NATO's cohesion through consultation",
<https://icds.ee/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ICDS_Brief_NATO2030_-Series_1_Wojciech_Lorenz_November-2020_cor.pdf>,
accessed 6/23/22, NB\]

NATO has been able to adapt to profound changes in international
relations largely due to its consultation mechanisms. [During the Cold
War, consultation enabled NATO to adjust its strategy to the Allies'
changing perceptions of the threat posed by the Soviet
Union]{.underline}. After the Cold War, [consultations
facilitated]{.underline} NATO's adjustment to new threats that required
out-of- area interventions and [engagement in the fight against
terrorism]{.underline}. Today, the Alliance is again trying to adjust to
a new reality. [With US policy in NATO likely to be determined by the
rise of China, the Allies will **have to consult** to come up with a
coherent approach to reconcile US global and European regional security
interests.]{.underline}

NATO was created as a collective defence organisation soon after World
War II to counterbalance the power of the Soviet Union. The Alliance's
military credibility was guaranteed by the economic, political and
military potential of the US and supported by American military presence
in Europe. In case of military attack, the Allies could invoke [Article
5]{.underline} of the Washington Treaty to trigger a collective military
response. The [credibility]{.underline} of this mutual security
guarantee [has been strengthened by consultation
mechanisms]{.underline}. Article 4 of the Washington Treaty gives Allies
the right to call for consultations if their "territorial integrity,
political independence or security \... is threatened."1 Rather than
rely on ad hoc consultations during crisis, NATO created the North
Atlantic Council---its main decision making body, which meets at least
weekly at the level of permanent representatives (ambassadors) and
regularly at higher political levels (foreign ministers, ministers of
defence and heads of state and government). Over the years, NATO has
developed habits, norms and institutional mechanisms that enable almost
continuous [consultations]{.underline} on the whole range of issues
affecting their security. These have facilitated the development of a
common strategy and necessary capabilities to support it, and [**limited
tensions among member states** with sometimes differing national
interests, strengthening the Alliance's political cohesion]{.underline}.
As NATO decisions are made by consensus, the consultation agenda also
has to be approved by all Allies. Informal discussion among various
groups of states and the weekly informal lunch of all representatives
can help to build a consensus on what should be discussed during formal
meetings, perhaps leading to politically binding decisions

THE COLD WAR ERA

The [1956 report of three ministers]{.underline} (the 'Three Wise Men')
offered clear practical suggestions for consultation, stating that it
"means discussion of problems collectively, in the early stages of
policy formation, and before national positions become fixed."2 The
report [significantly]{.underline} [influenced the development of NATO's
consultation norms]{.underline}. It made clear that [consultations are
**not about informing** other Allies about decisions that have **already
been taken**]{.underline}, [but **entail frank discussion** and the
**possibility of influencing national choices** that affect mutual
security]{.underline}.3

#### Genuine consultation can overcome differences and produce coordinated responses

**Lorenz, 20 \-\-- international security expert at the Polish Institute
of International Affairs** \[Wojciech, November, 2020, "Strengthening
NATO's cohesion through consultation",
<https://icds.ee/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ICDS_Brief_NATO2030_-Series_1_Wojciech_Lorenz_November-2020_cor.pdf>,
accessed 6/23/22, NB\]

[Although Allies]{.underline} will always [have]{.underline} some
[different interests, they can **use consultations** to limit their
negative, political impact]{.underline}. They can [also adjust
consultation]{.underline} mechanisms to changing strategic realities,
further [limiting the risk of tensions]{.underline} [and increasing the
probability of a common, coordinated response]{.underline}. The Allies
should thus agree a set of principles to guide their consultations in
the coming decade. These might include:

• [Consultations must **not be merely notifications** or briefings about
**decisions already taken**. They must entail frank discussions and the
chance to influence an Ally's actions.]{.underline}

• Consultations with Allies should always precede discussions with
rivals.

• Allies must consult before they take any decision that could undermine
the credibility of collective defence.

• When time permits, Allies should consult on actions out-of-area, which
could affect NATO security.

• When Allies agree on common actions out-of- area, there must be full
consultations on matters that may affect the common mission.

Allies can also take measures to influence their cost-benefit
calculations regarding timely discussions of crucial issues. They
should:

• Commit, in a highly visible political declaration, to observe agreed
norms.

• Formally assess whether the norms of NATO consultations, which require
frank discussion on matters affecting collective defence, have been
violated. This will be necessary to restore confidence in the
consultation mechanism in its most important dimension and to limit the
risk of future unilateral actions.

Create an incentive for consultations on issues that extend beyond
collective defence. Even though support for out-of-area actions cannot
be guaranteed, Allies could commit to not publicly criticise the actions
of an Ally that has used the consultation mechanism.

Small- and medium-sized countries, including the Baltic states and
Poland would be the biggest beneficiaries of enhanced consultations. It
is in their clear interest to use consultation to strengthen NATO's
political cohesion.

The Allies should also consider recasting their NATO+1 bilateral
relations with partners from the Asia-Pacific region (Australia, South
Korea, Japan, New Zealand) as a new NATO+4 multilateral cooperation
format, perhaps branded the NATO-Pacific Forum.11 [**Regular
consultations** would provide Allies and partners with better
situational awareness about evolving threats from both China and Russia,
**facilitating a coordinated response** in numerous areas, including
cyber, space or arms control.]{.underline}

Some Allies might wish to promote a reset with Russia under the pretext
of not pushing it into an alliance with China. This would not be in the
interests of the Baltic states and Poland, as any reset would inevitably
be at the expense of credible collective defence and deterrence in
Europe. NATO+4 consultations would, in exploring the common strategic
goals of China and Russia in undermining the rules-based international
order, limit the risk that Allies would view a Russia reset as a simple
answer to a complex problem, and facilitate a discussion on effective
responses to the challenges posed by both Russia and China as part of a
broader NATO strategy.

[NATO needs to take a **hard look** at itself]{.underline}. Across
twenty-five indicators of [democracy]{.underline} rated by Freedom
House, the **[downward trend]{.underline}** among NATO allies over the
past decade [is **stark**]{.underline}.35 [Especially in **Central
Europe**]{.underline} but not exclusively, there are setbacks in the
media, the judiciary and the functioning of national democratic
institutions. The rate at which [democracy is declining in **Poland**,
**Hungary** and **Turkey**]{.underline} is particularly alarming. In
2017 and 2018, these three states' scores represented some of the
largest one-year declines in political rights and civil liberties of all
195 countries ranked by Freedom House.36 Poland---with the largest
category declines in the forty-year history of the survey---is close to
leaving the "consolidated democracy" category.37 Hungary is no longer
rated a consolidated democracy. Turkey, whose decline in freedom over
the last ten years represents the largest of any country in the world,
crossed the threshold from "free" to "not free."38

While less severe today, [nationalist **populism**
movements]{.underline} in other allies [represent a broader, more
diffuse threat to NATO and can **amplify other challenges** facing the
Alliance]{.underline}. The United States is not immune, with its Freedom
House rating declining in 2018 due to "Russian interference in the 2016
election, violations of basic ethical standards by the new
administration and a reduction in government transparency."39 While this
slippage in the U.S. is relatively recent and still minor in scale, it
nonetheless diminishes America's standing as a standard-bearer for
democracy and further erodes its leadership position within the
Alliance. Further, anti-democratic policies among allies open
vulnerabilities for interference by competitors outside the Alliance,
especially Russia that seeks to divide NATO and the EU politically using
hybrid tactics.40

The question for allies is what must the role of the Alliance be in
reinforcing its core values when they are under assault from within.
NATO is both a political and a military alliance. It is not enough to be
bound together by a commitment only to Article 5 collective defense. The
values in the Treaty and the adherence of NATO allies to those values is
fundamental for Alliance cohesion. That shared commitment to values in
turn makes credible the Article 5 commitment. The Washington Treaty is
binding for both its political and military commitments.41 Allies cannot
ignore the failure to abide by political commitments including values
and expect military commitments to be unaffected. In short, NATO allies
should not expect that they could violate democratic values without
consequences, while resting assured that NATO cohesion is intact and
other commitments in the Treaty will be upheld. The Treaty is not a menu
of options from which allies can select some obligations while ignoring
others.

The NATO Treaty has no provision for policing members that drift from
common political values, unlike the European Union Treaty's Chapter 7
that has been invoked recently toward several EU member states with some
success.42 While it would be impossible to achieve consensus to impose
penalties on wayward allies, given that the ally in question could veto
any penalties, a range of escalating political initiatives on the part
of the Secretary General and a coalition of the other allies could
assert pressure. As a start, the Secretary General should express
concern in his bilateral meetings with the anti-democratic governments,
with the support of key allies and in partnership with the European
Union. To increase awareness within the Alliance and among the public,
foreign ministers could review annually indicators of democracy for all
twenty-nine allies, perhaps prepared by an informal high-level group of
experts drawing on Freedom House data. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly
and coalitions of allies can amplify the message.43 To increase
pressure, NATO could suspend hosting of visits, official meetings and
even military exercises with these nations. In severe cases, NATO
infrastructure spending and even access to military schools and
information sharing could be affected. An indirect way to express
concern among allies is to increase the prominence of core democratic
values when considering NATO enlargement decisions in the future.44 None
of these steps is without political cost and risk, even if calibrated
carefully. But the costs and risks of the gradual erosion of Alliance
cohesion as member states drift from the founding values are even
greater. NATO cannot expect to remain coherent and relevant and able to
address the full range of challenges it faces, if it ignores the
internal drift from democracy within some member states. This drift is a
fundamental issue for the Alliance.45

Streamlining NATO Decision-Making

Finally, the challenges facing NATO today demand more flexibility in
executive decision-making. As a core principle in preserving NATO
cohesion, consensus decision-making must remain the basis for major NATO
actions.46 [The Treaty requirements for **consensus** on]{.underline}
collective defense decisions [(Article 5)]{.underline} and enlargement
decisions (Article 10) [remain sensible]{.underline}. Major policy
decisions like the Defense Investment Pledge or the creation of the Very
High Readiness Joint Task Force rapid reaction capabilities require
consensus. [But today with NATO **enlarged** to **twenty-nine** members
and facing increasingly **diverse** and **complex** challenges, it is
time to **consider**]{.underline} how other, more routine,
administrative decisions can be taken more efficiently. But this should
be a management function, not derogation from the consensus principle.

We recommend strengthening the Secretary General's role as the chief
executive of the Alliance with broader authority to carry out routine
business without seeking consensus among the twenty-nine members. For
example, the Secretary General should consult allies on matters such as
agendas and timings of Ministerial Council meetings, but not be required
to seek consensus agreement. Today the agenda and even the dates of a
Foreign Minister meeting or a NATO-Russia Council meeting can consume
hours of formal Council time seeking consensus at the ambassadorial
level, consuming headquarters' bandwidth and crowding out more
substantive and urgent topics, including many outlined in this paper.
Further, the Secretary General's flexibility on international staff
personnel changes and NATO budget matters should be increased. Today,
for example, the Secretary General is severely constrained from adapting
the Alliance to emerging challenges by making meaningful shifts in
personnel and budgetary resources.47 While nations will continue to want
a critical role in all these decisions, criteria should be developed
that will provide for more flexibility while ensuring that all allies
gain a fair share of opportunities and allocation of resources.

[A related problem is the tendency of]{.underline} some [allies to
**bring into** the Alliance **bilateral issues** that **impede
progress** on collective issues of the Alliance. As an example, an ally
might **hold up agreement** on the **entire** NATO]{.underline} military
exercise [program because of an **unrelated bilateral dispute** with a
**NATO partner**]{.underline} who wishes to participate in an
exercise.48 [This practice **erodes Alliance cohesion**]{.underline} and
should not be permitted. After appropriate consultation, we recommend
the Secretary General should have the authority to exclude such external
issues from consideration in the Alliance, even if it means moving
forward without full consensus.

[This is a deeply meaningful moment for NATO. The secretary-general or

accession.]{.underline}

Finally, [as the most powerful member of NATO, **the US, has a special

underlying tensions which have been exacerbated by the EU's long
rejection of Turkish membership. [There may be incentives the US can

### U.S. Must Consider Turkey Concerns to Rebuild Relations 

#### U.S. must listen to Turkey's concerns in order to rebuild relations 

**Hess, 22 -- a Central Asia fellow at the Foreign Policy Research
Institute** (June 22, 22; Maximillian Hess; "Why the West should make
peace with Erdogan now";
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/22/turkey-erdogan-ukraine-russia-war-west-us-geopolitics-black-sea-europe-energy/,
AI)

[For Erdogan's drift away from the West and closer relations with Moscow
to be reversed, it is important to understand what motivated it. Today,
the West is paying a price for **failing to listen to his
concerns**.]{.underline} The drift initially began in 2011, as the Arab
Spring swept across North Africa and the Middle East. Erdogan was
ebullient, as the uprisings offered the prospect of bringing Islamists
similar to himself to power across the region. He felt betrayed when
then-U.S. President Barack Obama failed to uphold his redlines in Syria
and abandoned then-Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, affiliated with the
Muslim Brotherhood and publicly backed by Erdogan, when the Egyptian
military ousted Morsi in a coup. "Turkey has learned the hard way that
the U.S. is unwilling to invest in the region," Muhammet Kocak, an
international relations specialist based in Ankara, told me. Similarly,
["Turkey's security concerns have not been perceived as a particularly
relevant issue in the NATO agenda," said]{.underline} Elizabete [Aunina,
a doctoral researcher at the University of Amsterdam focused on Turkish
security policy]{.underline}.

But what accelerated Erdogan's drift away from the West---and shift to
Moscow---was his sense of betrayal after the 2016 failed Turkish coup,
which he publicly accused the United States of fostering.
[He]{.underline} also [felt abandoned by his NATO allies when Washington
withdrew its Patriot missile defense systems from Turkey]{.underline}
and when NATO barely even reacted after Turkey shot down a Russian
fighter aircraft intruding on its airspace, the first such incident
involving NATO and Russian or Soviet airpower in 60 years. Since then,
Erdogan felt that Moscow offered a better route to improving his
regional and domestic position.

Turkish-Russian cooperation since then includes the TurkStream pipeline,
plans for Russia to build a \$20 billion nuclear power plant in Turkey,
and the 2017 announcement that Ankara would buy Moscow's S-400 missile
defense system. And although Turkey and Russia have occasionally
sparred---they back differing sides in the Syrian and Libyan civil wars,
for example---relations have remained broadly warm and manageable. That
only increases the potential strategic leverage the West would gain if
it reversed Erdogan's orientation.

What carrot could the West offer Erdogan for abandoning Moscow? Turkey's
economic crisis may be just the opportunity. With annual inflation
reaching 73.5 percent in May, currency reserves near all-time lows, and
the Turkish lira down by 30 percent versus the dollar year-to-date
following a 44 percent drop in 2021, Turkey's risk of default has
spiked. Foreign investors have fled the market. Desperately searching
for fresh foreign capital, Erdogan even patched up relations with his
key regional rival, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It would be
better for the West to offer Erdogan an economic lifeline than to allow
Moscow to do so. The U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, for
example, should consider offering Erdogan a currency swap line, a
stabilizing instrument they have significantly expanded in recent
decades. Access to dollars and euros could alleviate many of Ankara's
mounting economic challenges and set the stage for a more cooperative
partnership.

Erdogan knows he has a strong hand and is likely to make other demands.
He has already exerted his leverage over Sweden's and Finland's desired
accession to NATO, linking it to a freer hand for Turkey against the
Syrian Kurds, who have been the West's valiant allies in the fight
against the Islamic State. Earlier this month, Erdogan announced plans
for a new operation targeting them. He may well make demands about other
regional interests, and he will certainly seek to blunt Western
criticism of his domestic governance. These concessions could prove
costly to other Western interests.

There is clear hesitancy to engage Erdogan at the moment. The West's
strategy appears to be to "count on the possibility Erdogan will lose
the \[June 2023\] elections," according to Kocak. Counting on Erdogan to
allow a free and fair election and a potential peaceful transfer of
power a year from now is idealistic at best and hopelessly naive at
worst.

[Erdogan is an unsavory character and will likely remain one. But it is
in the West's interest that he be on its side---not Russia's---in order
to weaken Putin and ensure Ukraine's survival. The opportunity is there,
and it would be unwise of the West not to try.]{.underline}

Although [alliances and multilateral coalitions]{.underline} can bolster
the security of member states and the efficiency of their military
operations, membership [can **create complications for decision-making**
and the coordination of military operations.]{.underline} First,
alliances and coalitions must overcome operational challenges
surrounding the integration and coordination of military forces. Modern
military operations require the close coordination of participating
forces, shared intelligence to guide planning and mission execution, and
weapon systems capable of communicating with and operating alongside
each other. [The military of each alliance or coalition member state
brings with it **different equipment, policies, and tactics**, meaning
that a state's forces may not fully integrate with the forces of its
allies]{.underline}.42 [Moreover, partners are often **reluctant to
share sensitive operational and intelligence
information**]{.underline}.43 Beyond these institutional issues, more
commonplace matters --- such as the **[different languages and military
cultures]{.underline}** of each member state --- [can **hinder
interoperability** during contingency operations]{.underline}.44 Second,
[alliance and coalition leaders may have trouble deciding what policies
their coalition should pursue]{.underline}. Although allies typically
face a common threat and share many policy objectives, [each state still
maintains its own priorities and goals. **State leaders**]{.underline}
therefore **[respond to domestic constituencies]{.underline}** and
pursue their own national interests, [which,]{.underline} at times, [may
be at **odds with alliance goals**]{.underline}.45 At best, these
divergent interests result in coordination problems that draw out
decision-making timelines.46 At worst, they generate mistrust between
partners and raise concerns of being abandoned during a crisis or

[Defence procurement is particularly complex, given the range of strict
requirements and specifications with which contractors have to
comply.]{.underline}251 This is why traditional weapons manufacturers
generally have an advantage when it comes to approaching defence
buyers.252 [AI]{.underline}, however, [will entail a **paradigm shift**
because the capabilities will continuously evolve]{.underline}. For
AI-enabled autonomous systems in particular, as mentioned above,
decision-making is "non-deterministic" and depends on the "dynamic
environment" in which the system operates.253 This means that
"traditional development and procurement approaches, based on full-path
regression, are unfit".254 This means that R&D also continues in the
product deployment phase, as data and algorithms keep providing
information and feedback that have to be integrated in order to achieve
initial operational capabilities. Current "waterfall" procurement
paradigms are set up so that engineers test prototypes according to
defined specifications, and then subsequently move to production.255
With machine learning, the specifications will keep evolving as
algorithms are fed new data.256 By extension, this means that testing
cannot be treated as a singular phase prior to production and
development. [For NATO Allies, a more iterative procurement
paradigm]{.underline} that does not depend on the sequential "waterfall"
[entails unique challenges. The integration of enterprise **AI requires
specific technical, legal, and organizational
capabilities**]{.underline}. [This is linked to **human-capital
challenges** in requirements, procurement and operations communities, as
organizations leveraging AI "need their own people who know how to
structure the problem, handle the data, and stay aware of evolving
opportunities".]{.underline}257 [The development of AI-centred major
weapon systems similarly calls for]{.underline} reform, or [at least a
remarkable adaptation, of defence procurement]{.underline}.258
**[Significant political, organizational and human capital will have to

On that note [NATO]{.underline}, or any other international

Which brings me to the third challenge. [The AI partnership symposium
did not offer a coherent strategy for the partnership beyond advancing
core values]{.underline} the participating nations find important to the
AI pipeline. [Peter Singer, New America Foundation fellow]{.underline}
and strategist, noted that the US has not yet offered a coherent
strategy to contrast its "near peers." In one article, Singer [said,
"China has a fairly clear and robust vision of this \[AI and its
applications\] and it is actively exporting that vision. There is
absolutely **no way the US can compete without offering a different and
compelling vision** and one that involves our friends and
allies."]{.underline} On the one hand, the absence of an overarching
strategy gives the DoD and the AI partnership latitude to address
inevitable issues that will arise. Secretary Esper noted in his address
that this kind of partnership is the first of its kind and needs time to
operate in the face of unforeseen challenges. But [to accomplish the
goal as the preferred security partner in AI, the partnership will need
to substantiate its agreement with a vision more concrete than just
ethical values.]{.underline} The AI partnership accomplishes getting
some allies on board, but does not clarify what vision is driving the
newfound partnership. At some point, this will need to change. In
essence, [the AI partnership is a necessary and welcome development in
the US AI strategy, but **significant legal and policy challenges** are
on the horizon]{.underline}. The three outlined here -- [legal
interoperability, trans-Atlantic cooperation, and an uncertain coherent

On this note, [the French conception of controlled AI]{.underline} goes
a step further and [ties auditability to the **core value of

because [the relationship between auditability and control stems from
geopolitical concerns. The strategy states, "France cannot resign itself
to being dependent on technologies over which it has no control. \[...\]
Preserving digital sovereignty therefore also involves controlling the
algorithms and their configuration, and the governance of
data."]{.underline}55 [This need for control comes from a desire to
**exert independence from the "stranglehold on AI exerted

strengthening European cooperation.]{.underline}56 While the
geopolitical aspects and [prospects of France to assert this

notable that they [trickle into the French approach to trace the

If enforced, this means that questions about data rights and legal
authorities to transfer data (including from foreign suppliers) could
render AI "uncontrolled" per the French definition. [Here,

By the end of 2020, NATO may have in place broad thinking on artificial
intelligence (AI) as part of a wider implementation strategy on how to
benefit from emerging technologies. [The Alliance could play an
important role in establishing interoperability standards along with
supporting norms of use in the military application of AI.]{.underline}
[NATO, however, has not always been successful in establishing
standards, nor in getting member states to comply.]{.underline} This
makes the recently set-up NATO Innovation Board, and its intended
year-end emerging-technologies implementation strategy, potentially all
the more important. An AI White Paper, including a proposed five-year
roadmap, is already with Alliance governments, having been submitted in
July. This could lead to a more detailed NATO AI strategy emerging
sometime in 2021. The AI challenge [The Alliance has the advantage of
having 30 members]{.underline} spending some US\$1 trillion (2020) on
defense. [Its wide membership, however, is also a **possible weakness**
if even a top-level common approach to AI cannot be agreed.]{.underline}
The Innovation Board's chair, NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea
Geoană, has the task of coordinating ongoing AI-related work across the
Alliance in attempting to shape a shared vision of how to utilise AI.
This will include working to identify capability needs and potential
projects for collaboration. NATO already has some AI-related projects
under way, including the Military Uses of Artificial Intelligence,
Automation, and Robotics project and the NATO Data Science Centre. The
former project is part of the United States-led Multinational Capability
Development Campaign and is intended to look at possible applications in
areas such as air and missile defense. The Data Science Centre's aim is
to bring together existing data-science expertise within NATO under one
structure. The Alliance views AI as one of several of what it calls
'emerging and disruptive technologies', which it considers will likely
have the greatest impact in combination. NATO's March 2020 'Science &
Technology Trends 2020-2040' report pointed to the mix of autonomy, big
data and AI, for example being used to generate decision-relevant
information from vast quantities of raw data, as having far-reaching
implications for defense and security. [The report also identified an
array of 'serious challenges' that NATO faces in managing AI, including
policy, legal, ethical and interoperability issues. It further
identified the need for a common approach]{.underline} to how the
performance of AI-software-based systems is verified, and in turn how
the verification process is itself validated. In some ways [NATO might
seem a natural forum for these deliberations]{.underline}, not least in
a transatlantic context. It also has a lot of experience, going back to
the Cold War, in working towards standardisation and interoperability
among allies. [However, the results achieved have been mixed, which
underscores the challenges the Alliance now faces: not only 30 members
with **disparate levels of capability**, but also a backdrop of rapid
technological advances where some of its competitors and potential
adversaries may hold significant advantages]{.underline}.
**[Interoperability issues may be thorny]{.underline}**, but they need
to be resolved if AI-dependent capability gaps between members are not
to widen. Early discussions regarding the establishment of common
technical standards on the design and development of military-applicable
AI would at least reduce this risk.

#### Disagreements among NATO members could derail its AI strategy

[The problem is that **NATO\'s members are at very different stages**
when it comes to thinking about AI in the military context.]{.underline}

[The U.S.,]{.underline} the world\'s biggest military spender, [has
prioritized the use of AI in the defense realm.]{.underline} But [in
Europe, most countries]{.underline} --- France and the Netherlands
excepting --- [barely mention the technology's defense and military
implications]{.underline} in their national AI strategies.

"It's absolutely no surprise that the U.S. had a military AI strategy
before it has a national AI strategy,\" but the Europeans \"did it
exactly the other way around,\" said Ulrike Franke, a senior policy
fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said:

That echoes familiar transatlantic differences --- and previous U.S.
President Donald Trump\'s complaints --- over defense spending, but also
highlights the different approaches to AI regulation more broadly.

[The EU\'s AI strategy takes a cautious line, touting itself as
\"human-centric,\"]{.underline} focused on taming corporate excesses and
keeping citizens\' data safe. [The U.S.]{.underline}, which [tends to
be]{.underline} light on regulation and keen on defense, sees things
differently.

[There are also divergences over what technologies the alliance ought to
develop]{.underline}, including lethal autonomous weapons systems ---
often dubbed "killer robots" --- programmed to identify and destroy
targets without human control.

[Powerful NATO members]{.underline} including France, the U.K., and the
U.S. [have developed these technologies and oppose a treaty on these
weapons, while others]{.underline} like Belgium and Germany [have
expressed serious concerns]{.underline} about the technology.

[These weapons systems have also faced fierce public opposition from
civil society and human rights groups, including from United
Nations]{.underline} Secretary-General António Guterres, who in 2018
called for a ban.

Geoană said [the alliance has "retained autonomous weapon systems as
part of the interests of NATO."]{.underline} The group hopes that its
upcoming recommendations will allow the ethical use of the technology
without "stifling innovation."

Staying relevant

[These issues threaten to hamper NATO\'s standard-setting
drive.]{.underline} \"I think there's a certain danger that if NATO
doesn't take this on as a real challenge, that it may be marginalized by
other such efforts," Franke said.

[She pointed to the U.S.-led AI Partnership for Defense]{.underline},
which consists of 13 countries from Europe and Asia to collaborate on AI
use in the military context --- [a forum which could supplant NATO as
the standard-setting body.]{.underline}

[That could have consequences for human rights, too.]{.underline}

"NATO... is a great place to responsibly think about how to harness the
good parts of this technology and how to prohibit the parts that would
be catastrophic for humanitarian law and human rights law, and people at
the end of the day," said Verity Coyle, a senior adviser at Amnesty
International, which is part of the Stop Killer Robots campaign.

["Without oversight mechanisms to ensure ethical standards and
measures,]{.underline} which would guarantee that this technology will
operate under meaningful human control" [NATO's strategy could head into
an "**ethical** **vacuum**,"]{.underline} Coyle said.

Franke said it\'s better for the alliance to focus on the basics, like
increased data sharing to develop and train military AI and cooperating
on using artificial intelligence in logistics.

["If NATO countries were to cooperate on that, that could create good
procedures and set precedents.]{.underline} And I think we should then
move on to the more controversial things such as autonomous weapons
systems," she said.

#### [Divergent public opinion]{.underline} on AI in NATO countries requires a [diplomatic campaign]{.underline} by the U.S. to forge a consensus

- Political differences over whether AI collaboration should be civilian
  or military focused

- Varied timelines for militaries adopting AI

- Incompatibilities in legal and regulatory structures

Strength In Diversity?

[Many of the national AI strategy documents of NATO allies and U.S.
allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific prioritize responsible
governance over AI]{.underline} in and, in some cases, AI-enabled
warfighting. [This apparent, high-level harmony notwithstanding,[ public
polling data from
2019](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/human-rights-watch-six-in-ten-oppose-autonomous-weapons) and[ 2021](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/global-survey-highlights-continued-opposition-fully-autonomous-weapons) suggest
that among U.S. security partners, **specific concerns** about the use
of lethal autonomous weapons systems **vary widely**.]{.underline}[ Data
from this
year](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-01/Global-opinions-and-expectations-about-AI-2022.pdf) show
[that the public's trust in AI more generally varies from **quite high
among some partners, as in** India and **Turkey**, to quite low, among
traditional NATO allies]{.underline} and Japan.

[U.S. leaders should thus not assume their allies will be reading from
an identical political or ethical playbook in future coalition
operations with AI]{.underline} in the mix. Once shooting begins,
coalition members frequently find they actually disagree about the
policies and strategies that should guide operations. **[Domestic
politics]{.underline}** [are often what shape the scope and[ limits of
coalition members'
contributions](https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/56/1/67/1941598) to
operations, and they can[ impact leaders' strategic
decisions](https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article-abstract/44/3/163/12282/Presidents-Politics-and-Military-Strategy)]{.underline} in
complex ways. This makes it worth thinking carefully about the benefits
and risks of working in a coalition where views about military AI use
and governance vary.

Intuitively, a diversity of perspectives is useful for creative
problem-solving. In plotting a course for research and development on
military AI,[ DoD set the
goal](https://media.defense.gov/2021/May/27/2002730593/-1/-1/0/IMPLEMENTING-RESPONSIBLE-ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-IN-THE-DEPARTMENT-OF-DEFENSE.PDF) of
building "a robust national and global \[responsible AI\] ecosystem"
among partner government, private sector, and academic institutional
partners to maximize creative potential and interoperability.

In operational contexts, however, [the stakes of **navigating
differences of the ethical frameworks** and policies that inform
leaders' and commanders' decisions are much higher. Without appropriate
ways of managing coalition contributions, **unforeseen mismatches** in
the skill levels and specialized capabilities of partner forces can
have [major negative
effects](https://stanford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.11126/stanford/9780804753999.001.0001/upso-9780804753999-chapter-8) on
military effectiveness.]{.underline} [[National political
differences](https://ecfr.eu/publication/not_smart_enough_poverty_european_military_thinking_artificial_intelligence/) about
whether AI collaboration should be civilian- or military-focused,
varied[ timelines over which militaries are adopting

and[ incompatibilities in legal and regulatory
structures](http://opiniojuris.org/2020/10/05/ai-partnership-for-defense-is-a-step-in-the-right-direction-but-will-face-challenges/) could
all present challenges to U.S.-led coalitions cohesively enacting shared
notions of military AI ethics]{.underline}. Is there a way to find
operational strength in this diversity?

A Responsible AI Coalition

It is in the U.S. interest to leverage the creative potential of a
diverse AI "ecosystem." However, it is also necessary to establish
habits that mitigate the risk that political, cultural, and
organizational differences among future coalition partners might
undermine collective, responsible AI use.

To do this, the Defense Department can take steps now to increase the
reliability with which future coalitions will operationalize the
foundations of international cooperation on military AI. The DoD should
pursue the three objectives and consider specific actions to pursue
them. Building these goals into the charter of the DoD's new Office of
the Chief Data and AI Officer (CDAO) that Deputy Secretary Kathleen
Hicks [directed](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Feb/02/2002931807/-1/-1/1/MEMORANDUM-ON-THE-INITIAL-OPERATING-CAPABILITY-OF-THE-CHIEF-DIGITAL-AND-ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-OFFICER.PDF) be
prepared by June 1, 2022, would help align institutional incentives to
accomplish them.

Establish a common language. First, policymakers, commanders, and
technical and legal experts in future coalitions must be able to speak a
common language to communicate about how AI systems ought to be used on
the battlefield---let alone about how they are developed and validated.
A December 2021 report by the Center for Naval
Analysis [identifies](https://www.cna.org/CNA_files/PDF/Dimensions-of-Autonomous-Decision-making.pdf?utm_source=Center+for+Security+and+Emerging+Technology&utm_campaign=1280c55e66-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_01_27_02_11&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fcbacf8c3e-1280c55e66-438318142) 565
unique policy and ethics "risk elements" the use of autonomous systems
pose in military applications. But, given the "bias that occurs when
operating in coalition and allied environments ... that stems from
different sets of treaties, ROE, or cultural norms," one imagines that
the opportunities for miscommunication in the absence of agreement on
the terms of debate will grow exponentially.

Despite China's efforts to[ lead in setting international AI technical
standards](https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/01/04/china-s-new-ai-governance-initiatives-shouldn-t-be-ignored-pub-86127),
it is clearly in the U.S. interest to pursue its own standards under
which it collaborates with military partners. The DoD should task the
CDAO to oversee a process to identify what resources would be necessary
to engage partners to develop and baseline U.S. programs around a
technical glossary for AI. Doing so would set the terms of debate among
the international partners DoD seeks to recruit to the responsible AI
ecosystem it seeks to establish. Without[ shared
language](https://warontherocks.com/2021/04/strategy-in-the-artificial-age-observations-from-teaching-an-ai-to-write-a-u-s-national-security-strategy/),
communicating about partners' capabilities and intent to use AI
responsibly will be difficult, posing risks for the strategic
effectiveness and political cohesion of future coalitions.

Regularizing international collaboration. Second, AI systems need to be
built for purpose and stress-tested in situations that approximate
coalition use contexts. In the pipeline from research and development
(R&D) and testing, evaluation, validation, and verification (TEVV) to
operational use and sustainment, it is not clear how the DoD is
considering the unique coalition command-and-control challenges of
AI-enabled systems. The sample of ongoing DoD activities with partners
described above tend to be country-, service-, or acquisition
program-specific efforts. To systematically ensure lessons learned are
not lost and forgotten in the massive Pentagon bureaucracy, the DoD
needs to first identify when program offices, service branches, and
country desk officers interact with partners in ways that should inform
AI system development, testing, and fielding.

Until now, the department has not needed to understand how its vast
network of partner governments and militaries are absorbing a
general-purpose technology like AI. A February 1 DoD memorandum
identifies roles the CDAO and the undersecretaries for Policy,
Acquisition and Sustainment (A&S), and Research and Engineering (R&E)
will play in international cooperation on AI. But, DoD lacks a
cross-cutting process for collecting technical and policy knowledge
derived from these international interactions and integrating it into
coalition policy, planning, or technical cooperation efforts on a
country-by-country or weapons system-by-system basis.

The DoD should task the CDAO, Policy, A&S, and R&E offices to create
one. These offices should establish metrics in R&D, TEVV, and
acquisitions processes that incentivize the bureaucracy to prioritize
technical and organizational interoperability and consider unique
requirements that might arise from ethical or policy questions likely to
arise in multinational use scenarios. This would help channel
international partner input to relevant points of contact across the
department, optimizing the value of the international "responsible AI
ecosystem" to U.S. coalition efforts.

[Engage allied publics]{.underline}. Last, [**differences in public
opinion** about the inherent legitimacy and desired forms of
accountability for AI-based weapons reflect **real divides** within and
between the polities that comprise America's alliance
network.]{.underline} [Bridging these gaps by[ monitoring public
discourse](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/IF11294.pdf) and[ **enhancing
public
diplomacy**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/11/biden-administration-needs-up-its-game-public-diplomacy/) about
military AI would have the effect of both educating the public at home
and abroad and help raise expectations that transparency is the
norm.]{.underline} In an era in which states select and enact military
strategies before a global public audience, it is important for
Americans, allies, and others to see that if the U.S. military
technological edge must be used in conflict, its leaders and its
partners choose to do so responsibly.

As China and Russia continue to use AI tools to enhance authoritarian
control at home, it is becoming commonplace to argue that the values
America and its allies share for responsible AI can represent
a [competitive edge of soft
power](https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/CSET-Agile-Alliances.pdf).
This might well be the case. Only if America and its allies are capable
of enacting these values on the AI-infused battlefield together, though,
will this advantage serve to help legitimize U.S.-led operations in the
world's eyes. A coalition's ability to uphold the laws of armed conflict
is ultimately bounded by the capability and willingness of its least
able members to do so.

### 1nc Autonomous Weapons Link -- Unity Specific

JMP)

[On paper, NATO is the ideal organization to go about setting standards
for military applications of artificial intelligence. But the **widely
divergent priorities and budgets** of its 30 members could get in the
way.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} Western military [alliance]{.underline} has identified
artificial intelligence as a key technology needed to maintain an edge
over adversaries, and it [wants to lead the way in establishing common
ground rules for its use.]{.underline}

"We need each other more than ever. No country alone or no continent
alone can compete in this era of great power competition," NATO Deputy
Secretary-General Mircea Geoană, the alliance's second in command, said
in an interview with POLITICO.

The standard-setting effort comes as China is pressing ahead with AI
applications in the military largely free of democratic oversight.

David van Weel, NATO's assistant secretary general for emerging security
challenges, said Beijing\'s lack of concern with the tech\'s ethical
implications has sped along the integration of AI into the military
apparatus.

\"I\'m \... not sure that they\'re having the same debates on principles
of responsible use or they\'re definitely not applying our democratic
values to these technologies," he said.

Meanwhile, the EU --- which has pledged to roll out the world\'s first
binding rules on AI in coming weeks --- is seeking closer collaboration
with Washington to oversee emerging technologies, including artificial
intelligence. But those efforts have been slow in getting off the
ground.

For Geoană, that collaboration will happen at NATO, which is working
closely with the European Union as it prepares AI regulation focusing on
"high risk" applications.

The pitch

NATO does not regulate, but "once NATO sets a standard, it becomes in
terms of defensive security the gold standard in that respective field,"
Geoană said.

[The alliance\'s own AI strategy]{.underline}, to be released before the
summer, [will identify ways to operate AI systems
responsibly]{.underline}, identify military applications for the
technology, and provide a "platform for allies to test their AI to see
whether it\'s up to NATO standards," van Weel said.

[The strategy will]{.underline} also [set ethical
guidelines]{.underline} around how to govern AI systems, for example [by
ensuring systems can be shut down by a human at all times]{.underline},
and to maintain accountability by ensuring a human is responsible for
the actions of AI systems.

["If an adversary would use autonomous AI powered systems in a way that
is not compatible with our values and morals, it would still have
defense implications because we would need to defend and deter against
those systems," van Weel said.]{.underline}

["We need to be aware of that and we need to flag legislators when we
feel that our restrictions are coming into the realm of \[being
detrimental to\] our defense and deterrence,"]{.underline} he continued.

Mission impossible?

[The problem is that NATO\'s members are at **very different stages**

difficult to control,"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/05/11/killer-robots-lethal-autonomous-weapons-systems-ukraine-libya-regulation/>,
JMP)

Swarms of robots with the ability to kill humans are no longer only the
stuff of science fiction. Lethal autonomous weapons systems [(LAWS) are
here]{.underline}. [In Ukraine, Moscow has allegedly deployed
an]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI)-enabled Kalashnikov ZALA
Aero KUB-BLA loitering munition, while Kyiv has used
**Turkish-made**]{.underline} Bayraktar **[TB2 drones]{.underline}**,
[which have some autonomous capabilities]{.underline}. Although [it's
always hard to determine whether a weapon's autonomous mode is
used]{.underline}, these technologies have reportedly been employed in
at least one conflict: Last year, [a]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[N]{.underline}**ations [report suggested
Turkey used autonomous firing by its Kargu-2 drones to hunt fleeing
soldiers in Libya's civil war]{.underline} (though the CEO of the
Turkish company that produced the drone denies it is capable of this).

Unlike traditional drones, these systems have the ability to navigate on
their own, and some can select targets. [Although a human controller can
still decide whether or not to strike, such weapons are acquiring ever
more autonomous capabilities.]{.underline} Now that [militaries and
paramilitaries worldwide have taken note, these technologies are poised
to spread widely]{.underline}. The world today stands at the very moment
before much more advanced versions of these technologies become
ubiquitous.

So far, at least Israel, Russia, South Korea, and Turkey have reportedly
deployed weapons with autonomous capabilities---though whether this mode
was active is disputed---and Australia, Britain, China, and the United
States are investing heavily in developing LAWS with an ever-expanding
range of sizes and capabilities.

Already, some LAWS can loiter in an area to find targets that
machine-learning algorithms have trained them to recognize, including
enemy radar systems, tanks, ships, and even specific individuals. These
weapons can look vastly different: For instance, the Turkish Kargu-2
drone, which was introduced in 2020 and used in Libya's war, is 2 feet
long, weighs around 15 pounds, and can swarm in groups. Autonomous
systems can also be much larger, such as unmanned AI-driven fighter jets
like the modified L-39 Albatros, and much smaller, such as rudimentary
commercial drones repurposed with autonomous software.

Once these technologies have spread widely, they will be difficult to
control. The world thus urgently needs a new approach to LAWS. So far,
the international community has done nothing more than agree that the
issue needs to be discussed. But what it really needs to do is take a
page from the nuclear playbook and establish a nonproliferation regime
for LAWS.

Currently, [countries at the forefront of LAWS development **resist any
calls for their ban**]{.underline}. The United States has claimed that
existing international humanitarian laws are sufficient to govern LAWS;
the U.S. Defense Department's policy is that they must be designed to
ensure "appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force."
China has remained ambiguous, stating the importance of "full
consideration of the applicability of general legal norms" while
insisting on a narrow definition of LAWS. Russia, meanwhile, refuses to
even consider the issue, using diplomatic procedural tools to stall and
reduce the time the United Nations devotes to debating the subject.

But most countries have called for a ban on developing and using
LAWS---or, at a minimum, regulating them. In 2019, U.N.
Secretary-General António Guterres said LAWS are "politically
unacceptable, morally repugnant, and should be prohibited by
international law."

There are many reasons countries, international nongovernmental
organizations, scholars, and AI experts worry about LAWS. Although they
do not all agree in their predictions of how such weapons could affect
society, there's a growing consensus that their spread could bring
substantial and harmful consequences.

First, LAWS could facilitate violence on a large scale since they're not
restricted by the number of people available to man them. Second, in
combination with facial recognition and other technologies, they can
target individuals or groups that fit certain descriptions, which could
appeal to violent groups and state militaries committing political
assassinations and ethnic cleansing. Third, LAWS may make it easier for
those who control them to hide their identities. LAWS thus have the
potential to upend political orders and enable tighter authoritarian
control. In addition, they can always malfunction, including by
mistaking civilians for combatants.

[So far, the international community has attempted---and **failed---to
regulate LAWS**]{.underline}. [In December 2021, after eight years of
technical discussions, government and civil society representatives met
at the U.N.]{.underline} in Geneva to set an agenda for regulating LAWS
for the first time in what was billed as a "historic opportunity."

[Most attendees favored legally binding rules]{.underline} that apply
equally to all states to govern the development and use of these
technologies. [Yet]{.underline}, by any standard, [the meeting
failed]{.underline}. **[Despite years of preparatory
discussions]{.underline}** within the framework of the U.N. Convention
on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW)---a forum for restricting the use
of weapons considered to cause unnecessary or unjustifiable suffering to
combatants or to affect civilians indiscriminately---[the attendees
barely managed to agree on 10 more days of discussion]{.underline} this
March and July. [This outcome was to be **expected** given the positions
of the major powers and the CCW rules **requiring consensus** before
action is taken.]{.underline} (Disclosure: Both authors have been
affiliated with the CCW.)

In response, a wide array of actors---from Amnesty International and
Human Rights Watch to some of the states in favor of a LAWS ban,
including Argentina and the Philippines---are calling for a process to
develop legally binding prohibitions on these weapons outside of the
CCW. Alternative approaches to prohibition treaties have had some
success in the past, such as when countries agreed to give up land mines
through the 1997 Ottawa convention; cluster munitions through the 2008
Oslo Accords; and even nuclear weapons through the 2017 Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was the first treaty to completely
ban nuclear weapons in line with international humanitarian law and
establish pathways for current nuclear weapon states to renounce them.
However, while many states signed these treaties, most of the powerful
states did not.

Unfortunately, [even]{.underline} this [limited success is likely to be
**elusive** in the case of LAWS]{.underline}. [The primary reason is
that states are increasingly aware that these non-substitutable
technologies may **become crucial to their security**]{.underline} and
are thus unlikely to unilaterally abandon them. If states' adversaries
have them, they will likely believe they need them---and absent the sort
of nonproliferation regime that exists for nuclear weapons, their
adversaries will, in fact, continue to rapidly develop LAWS without much
oversight.

Nonproliferation has yet to receive much attention in the case of LAWS,
but it has worked to varying degrees in the past with the missile
technology control regime, biological weapons, chemical weapons, and, of
course, nuclear weapons.

The landmark Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty (NPT), which
entered into force in 1970, met the requirements of major and lesser
powers: It did not require those who possessed nuclear weapons to
renounce them immediately, allowed other states access to the benefits
of civilian use of nuclear power, and relied on a trusted international
organization that was charged with the dual responsibility of promoting
and controlling nuclear technology.

A similar nonproliferation regime for LAWS could facilitate regulation
of their development, transfer, and employment---even by the powers that
do not give them up. It would reduce the use of these technologies for
authoritarian control and terrorist actions worldwide and, as in the
nuclear case, create the possibility of developing norms against LAWS
use that apply to all.

This would admittedly be complicated. The nuclear nonproliferation
regime has thus far been largely successful because it has been a
central pillar of major powers' grand strategies. Indeed, detente in the
Cold War involved superpowers agreeing to police proliferation in their
spheres of influence. Security guarantees mollified countries that
otherwise would have felt too insecure to forgo nuclear weapons. Threats
and promises convinced countries, such as Iran when it signed the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action, to accept stricter limits on its nuclear
program than it would have otherwise.

Without this focused attention, nonproliferation and arms embargo
regimes regularly fail. Indeed, [the autonomous weapons used in Libya
were **exported by Turkey in violation of a U.N. arms
embargo**]{.underline}. [A successful LAWS nonproliferation regime would
thus **require states to prioritize the issue** more than they currently
do in their national security strategies, especially as the technologies
become more widespread and effective.]{.underline}

### 2nc Autonomous Weapons Link -- Turkey Specific 

#### Turkey is developing and selling drones \-\-- its emboldening Erdogan and impacting larger US-NATO-Turkey relations

**Forrest & Marson, 21** (4 June 2021, Brett Forrest, James Marson, Dow
Jones Institutional News, "Armed Low-Cost Drones, Made by Turkey,
Reshape Battlefields and Geopolitics -- WSJ," Factiva database, JMP)

A soldier idles by a Russian-made T-72 tank. A moment later, a missile
fired from a drone slams into the vehicle, exploding in an orange flash,
blowing the man off his feet and leaving the tank a smoldering wreck.

The scene is one of dozens of aerial videos that were posted online in
Azerbaijan last year showing off a new weapon. Over six weeks, it helped
the nation regain territory in the Nagorno-Karabakh region that had been
held by Russian-backed Armenian forces for more than two decades. The
videos show attacks on tanks, trucks, command posts, mortar positions
and radar installations.

[Smaller militaries around the world are deploying inexpensive
missile-equipped drones against armored enemies, a new battlefield
tactic that proved successful last year in regional conflicts,
**shifting the strategic balance around Turkey and
Russia**.]{.underline} [**Drones built in Turkey** with affordable
digital technology wrecked tanks and other armored vehicles, as well as
air-defense systems, of Russian protégés in battles waged in Syria,
Libya and Azerbaijan.]{.underline}

These drones point to future warfare being shaped as much by cheap but
effective fighting vehicles as expensive ones with the most advanced
technology.

China, too, has become a leading war drone exporter to the Middle East
and Africa. Iran-linked groups in Iraq and Yemen used drones to attack
Saudi Arabia. At least 10 countries, from Nigeria to the United Arab
Emirates, have used drones purchased from China to kill adversaries,
defense analysts say.

\"The implications are game changing,\" U.K. Defense Secretary Ben
Wallace said in a speech last year, citing Syria\'s heavy losses to
Turkish drones.

Flying alone or in a group, these drones can surprise troops and disable
poorly concealed or lightly defended armored vehicles, a job often
assigned to expensive warplanes. The drones can stay quietly aloft for
24 hours, finding gaps in air-defense systems and helping target strikes
by warplanes and artillery, as well as firing their own missiles.

Militaries, including the U.S., are upgrading air-defense systems to
catch up with the advances, seeking methods to eliminate low-budget
drones without firing missiles that cost more than their targets.

The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory is also developing Skyborg and
Valkyrie, lower-cost autonomous aircraft that are part of an innovation
program. \"Our adversaries are already fielding technologies that will
hold our legacy platforms at risk,\" an Air Force official said in a
statement.

Israel and the U.S. have long used high-end drones in counterterrorism
operations to target prominent enemies. But the countries have hesitated
to sell their top models, even to allies, for fear of proliferation.

Responding to drone deals that China and other producers have struck
with countries shunned by the U.S., the Trump administration last July
relaxed its export policy somewhat, potentially boosting sales of more
capable models than previously allowed. The United Arab Emirates said in
January it had agreed to buy 18 U.S.-made MQ-9 drones for nearly \$3
billion.

Technological advances and global competitors have produced inexpensive
alternatives. The standard-bearer of the latest armed-drone revolution
emerged last year on the battlefields around Turkey, the Bayraktar TB2.

Compared with the American MQ-9, the TB2 is lightly armed, with four
laser-guided missiles. Its radio-controlled apparatus limits its basic
range to around 200 miles, roughly a fifth of the ground the MQ-9 can
cover.

Yet it is utilitarian, and reliable \-- qualities reminiscent of the
Soviet Kalashnikov AK-47 rifle that changed warfare in the 20th century.
A set of six Bayraktar TB2 drones, ground units, and other essential
operations equipment costs tens of millions of dollars, rather than
hundreds of millions for the MQ-9.

The drone\'s Turkish producer, Baykar, which started in 1984 making auto
parts, boasts of more bang for the buck. [Qatar and Ukraine are
customers. Poland]{.underline}, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization
member, [said]{.underline} last month [it would buy 24 TB2
drones]{.underline}. [Several other NATO allies are
interested]{.underline}, as well as countries in Africa and Asia,
Turkish government and company officials said.

Turn the tide

The TB2 drone gained international notice in the skies over Syria in
early 2020.

Toward the end of February, the Syrian regime, backed by Russia, was
advancing on the city of Idlib, which was held by rebels supported by
Turkey. After an air raid killed more than 30 Turkish soldiers, Turkey
embarked on Spring Shield, an operation that integrated drones with
electronic warfare systems, ground troops, artillery and warplanes.

The drones, quiet and hard to spot on radar, flew for hours seeking gaps
in air-defense systems, which fell \"like domino tiles\" once breached,
said Haluk Bayraktar, chief executive of Baykar. The vehicles operated
in groups of a dozen or so to attack targets simultaneously, Turkish
government and company officials said.

Ismail Demir, head of Turkey\'s state body overseeing the defense
industry, said the low cost of these drones allows military forces to
take more risks with them. \"If you lose one, two, three,\" he said, it
doesn\'t matter as long as others find a target.

Last spring, the TB2s helped turn the tide in the Libyan civil war for
the Tripoli-based government, which is backed by the United Nations.

Turkey had sent arms in 2019 to stem an assault on the capital by
militia leader Khalifa Haftar, who is supported by Russia and others. In
2020, Turkey increased military support. Improved drone tactics honed in
Syria provided the upper hand against Russian-made surface-to-air
missile systems known as Pantsir, handing the Tripoli government aerial
supremacy. By June, Mr. Haftar\'s forces retreated from Tripoli.

The success of the drones has helped Turkey President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan, an at-times fractious U.S. ally, to expand his regional
influence without risking significant numbers of troops or costly
equipment.

While Turkey\'s enhanced capabilities may benefit
**[NATO]{.underline}**, fellow [members worry that the ability
of]{.underline} Mr. [Erdogan to deploy and sell drones could
**embolden** his assertive pursuit of a more **independent foreign and
security policy**]{.underline}.

[\"The U.S., like a lot of European partners, is **leery of Turkey\'s
drone exports** and the aggressive way Turkey has been using drones in
these conflicts,\"]{.underline} said Dan Gettinger, a researcher at the
Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, a nonpartisan policy research
group in Arlington, Va.

Mike [Nagata, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general in special
operations, said drones were \"part of a much larger challenge regarding
the **future of the relationship between Turkey and the**]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and
NATO]{.underline}**.\"

### 2nc Turkey LAWs Reduce Civilian Casualties 

#### Turkey autonomous weapons reduce human casualties through [precise targeting]{.underline}

**Tekingunduz, 21 \-\-- BA focused in International Relations and
Political Science from Boğaziçi University** (3 JUN 2021, Alican, "A
series of autonomous drones gives Turkey a military edge,"
<https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/a-series-of-autonomous-drones-gives-turkey-a-military-edge-47201>,
JMP)

Defense Technologies and Trade Inc. (STM), a [Turkish]{.underline}
company that manufactures Kargu-2 drones and supplies them to the
Turkish military, told the media last year that their drones also [have
facial recognition technology, which gives a major advantage to the
Turkish security forces in identifying individual targets so they could
be neutralised **without deploying forces on the ground**.]{.underline}

Murat Ikinci, the former CEO of STM, was quoted in Turkish media in 2019
as saying that the main advantages of Karagu-2 swarms is that their
sheer number can overwhelm targets and they can evade the GPS jammers.

According to the UN report, the Kargu-2 attack in Libya had achieved the
desired results. Heavy military installations, convoys and hordes of
mercenaries and armed personnel working for Haftar were \"hunted down
and remotely engaged by lethal autonomous weapons systems such as the
STM Kargu-2\".

\"The lethal autonomous weapons systems were programmed to attack
targets without requiring data connectivity between the operator and the
munition: in effect, a true \'fire, forget and find\' capability,\" the
report reads.

\"In the modern world, priority should be given to the protection of
intellectual and physical human capital which means a lighter workload
on military personnel,\" Merve Seren said.

According to Seren, [access to superior technology like Kargu-2 drones
has helped the Turkish military to **prevent civilian
casualties**]{.underline}.

\"Turkey has a very clear and successful history of using drones to
avoid civilian casualties,\" she said.

[**Pinpointing enemy targets with precision** have become one of the
main hallmarks of Turkish drones.]{.underline} [Their appropriate use in
Syria and the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict proved that they can
**minimize collateral damage**]{.underline}.

Besides attacking, these kamikaze-style drones --- Kargu-2, Alpagu,
Togan and Simsek --- can also carry out intelligence-gathering missions,
surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance.

[They can attack targets in areas where there was no mobile data or
Internet connectivity between the operator and the warhead.]{.underline}

[Turkey\'s success in producing high-calibre drones comes on the heels
of its national policy of becoming self-sufficient in defence
manufacturing.]{.underline} According to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan,
the country had 62 defence projects in 2002 and by 2020 the figure has
grown to 700, along with the annual defence budget, which has increased
from \$5.5 billion to \$60 billion.

### 2nc AT: Turkey Doesn't Use Autonomous Weapons 

#### Turkey is developing and deploying autonomous weapons without connectivity to humans

Iraq as a Turkish military adviser from 2002 to 2008** (June 8, 2021,
Metin Gurcan, "Turkish drone sets off international buzz over \'killer
robots\'; The appearance of Turkish artificial intelligence-controlled
drones in Libyan skies has rekindled questions on how lethal autonomous

<https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2021/06/turkish-drone-sets-international-buzz-over-killer-robots>,
JMP)

Turkey's flourishing drone industry is back in the international
spotlight following a UN report suggesting that [Turkish-made artificial
intelligence-based drones might have been used to kill enemy troops in
Libya]{.underline} last year. If confirmed [the incident would mark the
debut of "killer robots" in the global theater of war]{.underline}.

[The report by the UN Panel of Experts on Libya indicates]{.underline}
that a Kargu-2 kamikaze drone manufactured by Turkey's state-owned
company STM was likely used in March 2020 in clashes between the forces
of the Turkish-backed Government of National Accord and the Libyan
National Army of eastern warlord Khalifa Hifter following the latter's
besiegement of Tripoli. [Logistics convoys and retreating Hifter forces
"were hunted down and remotely engaged by the unmanned combat aerial
vehicles or the lethal autonomous weapons systems such as the STM
Kargu-2 and other loitering munitions,"]{.underline} the report says.
["The lethal autonomous weapons systems were programmed to attack
targets **without requiring data connectivity between the operator and
the munition**]{.underline}: in effect, a true 'fire, forget and find'
capability," it noted without specifying whether anyone was actually
killed.

#### International negotiations to regulate autonomous weapons are [in response to]{.underline} Turkey's weapons 

**Gurcan, 21 \-\-- served in Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and

JMP) **\*\*\*Note -- STM =Turkey's state-owned company who manufactured
the Kargu-2 kamikaze drone**

While such technologies sound like a revolutionary step in warfare, a
global debate has been simmering since the early 2000s on whether lethal
autonomous weapon systems should be regulated or banned, given ethical
concerns over their ability to select and hit targets without human
intervention. The release of the UN report on Libya has rekindled the
debate, which had been largely hypothetical thus far.

Another aspect of the debate is how and to what extent autonomous
systems will change the character of war. The US journal Popular
Mechanics draws a comparison to how the atomic bomb served as a divider
between eras, saying [the events in Libya "may similarly divide the time
when humans had full control of weapons, and a time when **machines made
their own decisions to kill**."]{.underline}

Many argue that lethal autonomous systems should be banned under an
international treaty similar to the 2017 UN Treaty on the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons, designed as a legally binding instrument aimed at fully
eradicating nuclear weapons.

Another argument has it that lethal autonomous systems fall into the
scope of indiscriminate weapons and should be banned under an existing
UN convention prohibiting or restricting conventional weapons deemed to
be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects.

In 2019, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged states to take
action to ban autonomous weapons systems. "Machines with the power and
discretion to take lives without human involvement are politically
unacceptable, morally repugnant and should be prohibited by
international law," he said.

The International Committee of the Red Cross urged governments in
mid-May to prohibit the use of autonomous weapons for targeting human
beings and impose strict restrictions on other uses. [Human Rights
Watch]{.underline}, meanwhile, has [called for "a new process ... to
negotiate an international treaty on killer robots," **highlighting the
UN report on the incident involving the Kargu-2** in Libya]{.underline}
and Azerbaijan's alleged use of Israeli-made Harop loitering munitions
in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict last year.

[STM]{.underline} has kept mum in the face of international reactions to
the UN report. The company [is likely pleased with the publicity in
terms of marketing and future exports]{.underline}, but it needs to
consider not only the technological aspect of the matter but also its
implications in terms of international law, diplomacy and ethical
concerns.

Back in 2013, I penned an article --- "Drone warfare and contemporary
strategy making: Does the tail wag the dog?" --- that questioned whether
new military technologies are undermining the subjugation of military
technique to military strategy and thus policy. The question remains
pertinent today in the context of lethal autonomous weapons. Such
weapons are likely to change the nature of war, including political and
ethical views of war. In the face of one-way determinist views of the
impact of autonomous systems, I am inclined to believe that the
interaction of autonomous systems with military strategy, ethics,
culture and politics has barely begun.

## Cyber

### 1nc Cyber Link 

#### [Complexity]{.underline}, [conflicting interpretations]{.underline}, and fights over [intel sharing]{.underline} block agreement

**Arts '18** \[Sophie; December 13; senior program coordinator for
security and defense policy at The German Marshall Fund; \"Offense as
the New Defense: New Life for NATO's Cyber Policy,\"
https://www.gmfus.org/publications/offense-new-defense-new-life-natos-cyber-policy\]

While the United States' announcement that it would contribute its
capabilities could help lend credibility to NATO's cyber deterrence,
further [[clarification is needed]{.mark} within NATO, particularly
[when it comes to]{.mark} its [**command structure** in]{.mark}
the]{.underline} [**[cyber]{.mark} domain**. [**Without**
clarity]{.mark}]{.underline} on this front, [it [is **hard to

[allies]{.mark}** [who have **different threat perceptions**, and face

The new Cyber Operations Center, which should be fully operational in
2023, could play an important role in that respect, but the lack of
operational authority may pose a significant challenge.37 According to
NATO, the center aims to "strengthen cyber defenses and integrate cyber
capabilities into NATO planning and operations."38 But as the U.S.
declaration on its potential cyber support to NATO confirms, it appears
at this point that the center will serve to coordinate rather than
oversee operations. [[This, **coupled**]{.underline}
[with]{.underline}]{.mark} [allies' [**unwillingness** to **share

Political Policy and Institutional Arrangements

The fact that a given cyber threat or incident crosses the threshold of
political concern is without prejudice to its political and legal
characterisation for the purpose of developing an appropriate response.
Much will depend on political policy perceptions -- are cyber threats
and incidents predominantly perceived as human rights (i.e. data
privacy) issues, matters of law enforcement and/or homeland security300,
or matter of national security and defence -- and the different roles
played by the government agencies involved on the examination and
assessment of cyber threats and incidents, and competent to adopt or
contribute to actual responses. Accordingly, [it may be [for **multiple
reasons**]{.mark} that [NATO faces **challenges**]{.mark} in
[**developing consensus** regarding]{.mark}]{.underline} the full
integration of [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} security and
[defence]{.underline} in its respective mechanisms, as well as the
necessary institutional arrangements.

[First, in an environment where any security and defence discourse is to
a great extent **predetermined** by the **level of political concern**,
there may simply have **be**en a **limited number of opportunities** to
actually put cyber security and defence **prominently** on NATO\'s
agenda. Second, quite similar to threats arising from international
**terrorism**, threats arising in and out of the [cyber]{.mark} space
may give rise to both internal, or homeland, and external security
concerns, and thus [trigger]{.mark} the oftentimes [**complex
delineations** of **competence** between]{.mark} the [**defence**, **law
enforcement**, and **intel**]{.mark}ligence sectors [which many]{.mark}
NATO [Nations have]{.mark} developed into **[strong checks]{.mark} and
balances** [amounting to]{.mark} a **[s]{.mark}eparation [o]{.mark}f
[p]{.mark}owers** [*en miniature* within their executive
branches]{.mark} of government. Whilst obviously such **[domestic
arrangements]{.mark}** lack the capacity to affect the interpretation
and application of the **N**]{.underline}orth **[A]{.underline}**tlantic
**[T]{.underline}**reaty301, [they may nevertheless **[*de facto*
challenge]{.mark}** NATO Nations\' Defence [Ministries\']{.mark} as well
as Armed Forces\' [**ability** to put cyber]{.mark} security and defence
[on NATO\'s]{.mark} policy, concept, and doctrine [agendas]{.mark}. To
date, [no]{.mark} well-entrenched [method]{.mark}, structure or process
[for overcoming this]{.mark} *de facto* challenge]{.underline} -- e.g.
through involvement of foreign intelligence, homeland security and/or
law enforcement stakeholders -- [[exists]{.mark} within NATO. Third,
there is a **near complete lack** of NATO-wide, standardised doctrine
for cyber warfare. The resulting **absence**]{.underline}, amongst NATO
Nations, [of a militarily agreed and legally cleared]{.underline}
(Article 36 of GP I) [understanding concerning the means and methods of
cyber warfare may also contribute to the **lack of political policy
consensus**]{.underline}. The appetite for engaging in hostilities which
might be perceived as potentially involving legally doubtful means and
methods of warfare may be limited. [Ultimately, the **[absence of
consensus]{.mark}** regarding *jus [in bello]{.mark}* may thus [have
**repercussions** on]{.mark} the **[likelihood]{.mark}** that
[**consensus can be reached** concerning]{.mark} *jus ad bellum* as well
as [collective]{.mark} security and [defence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Even if they support it [in the abstract]{.underline}, the plan's a [180-degree flip-flop]{.underline} from NATO's [recently announced]{.underline} posture

Thomas E. **Ricks 17**, "NATO's Little Noticed but Important New
Aggressive Stance on Cyber Weapons", Foreign Policy, 12/7/2017,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/07/natos-little-noticed-but-important-new-aggressive-stance-on-cyber-weapons/

[**Not many** people **noticed**]{.underline} it, [but **last month**,
[NATO made a **dramatic change**]{.mark} in its cyber
policy]{.underline} announced by the NATO Secretary General that
arguably was [[the]{.mark} alliance's **[biggest]{.mark} overall policy
[shift]{.mark}** [in **decades**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Having led the
policy discussions in several NATO committees for the past four years on
the use of cyber capabilities and **[[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}**
weapons, I can tell you this [[was]{.mark} the most **[hotly
debated]{.mark}** and **contentious** decision]{.underline} during my
tenure at NATO.

[In short, [NATO **embraced**]{.mark} **the [use]{.mark}** of cyber
weaponry in NATO operations. This is a **marked departure** from NATO's
historical stance of using cyber only defensively]{.underline}, mainly
to ward off incursions against its own networks. The more aggressive
approach was [intended as a **strong message**]{.underline}, primarily
[to Russia, that NATO intends to]{.underline} use the cyber capabilities
of its members to **[deter]{.underline}** attacks in the same way it
uses land, sea, and air weaponry.

[[Russia's]{.mark} **provocative [actions]{.mark}** [during]{.mark} the
**[U.S.]{.mark} Presidential elections**, its attempts to influence the
[**French** and **German** elections, and]{.mark} its blatantly
aggressive, and on-going cyberwar against [**Ukraine** were]{.mark}
likely **[key]{.mark} determining factors** which led the NATO defense
ministers to adopt a **more assertive** stance.]{.underline}

On the surface, NATO's cyber policy shifts might seem to be little more
than incremental changes to its existing policy. [However, the fact the
alliance is standing up a cyber operations center to integrate cyber
capabilities from alliance members **sends a message** to the
world]{.underline}, especially Russia, that alliance members both
possess and have the will to use their cyber capabilities and weaponry
during military operations.

#### That makes reversal [super difficult]{.underline}

https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1119569/FULLTEXT01.pdf

Formulating clear doctrines is frequently preferred by militaries, while
politicians and diplomats prefer flexibility in message and response.
[The Alliance has **two paths**]{.underline} it can chose in creating
the doctrine regarding cyber. [It can either chose [a **public
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather similar to its approach when
creating its most recent strategic concept. [In such a document it
[could]{.mark} generally describe what constitutes an attack that would
[qualify]{.mark} for the [invocation of Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline},
and what would be an accepted retaliatory action. [The **other path** is
to **maintain strategic ambiguity**, recognizing that **formulating
clear redlines** would **invite potential adversaries** to **push up to
the red line**. In this case developing the doctrine is **still
important**, but would then be **for internal use only**]{.underline}.
This non-public approach may reduce the objective of improving the
Alliance´s cyber deterrence. [The **[pace of development]{.mark}** in
the field would [argue **against**]{.mark} an **[overly specific]{.mark}
set of [guidelines]{.mark}** or **doctrine**, [lest it require **too
frequent** and **politically challenging updates**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

so based on NATO members' assumption that the two countries' membership
of the alliance would pacify their behavior toward each
other]{.underline}.

China was invited to join the World Trade Organization in 2001 on the
same premise.

But [[as every relationship counselor tells **quarreling couples**, you
can't change someone's personality]{.mark}. Thus, NATO finds itself with
two member states that are [officially allies, but]{.mark} whose
**[suspicion]{.mark}** of each other [is **never far**]{.mark} from the
surface]{.underline}. How to broker between two members without taking
sides? NATO seems \[gridlocked\] paralyzed.

But in reality, it's not. Sure, two quarreling member states will affect
an alliance, but NATO is still going strong on its main mission:
defending the territorial integrity of its member states against sundry
territorial threats from other countries and nonstate actors.

Here, one could in fact wish for more participation from Greece and
Turkey. According to NATO's latest Enhanced Forward Presence figures,
for example, neither country contributes to the protection of the Baltic
states and Poland. Solidarity goes both ways.

NATO's purpose as an organization is to ensure the collective defense of
its members on the basis of its founding Washington Treaty. [It was

OPERATIONS AND NATO STRATEGY"

//AB

Additionally, [the reality is that several NATO members are already
speaking publicly about offensive cyber operations below the level of
warfare and their statements and actions have an effect on the entire
alliance. In particular, NATO member nations have **not reached a
political consensus** about the role of offensive cyber
operations.]{.underline} In 2018, the US Department of Defense and US
Cyber Command issued
new [strategy](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Sep/18/2002041658/-1/-1/1/CYBER_STRATEGY_SUMMARY_FINAL.PDF) and
policy [documents](https://www.cybercom.mil/Portals/56/Documents/USCYBERCOM%20Vision%20April%202018.pdf) that
articulated a role for the military in conducting offensive cyber
operations below the level of armed conflict outside of US-controlled
cyberspace (part of the "defend forward" strategy), and there has been
some reporting about US offensive cyber operations. For instance,
in [2018](https://warontherocks.com/2019/03/what-a-u-s-operation-against-russian-trolls-predicts-about-escalation-in-cyberspace/) the
United States disrupted the Russian-linked Internet Research Agency from
interfering in the midterm elections. And, more recently, in [December
2021](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/05/politics/us-cyber-command-disrupt-ransomware-operations/index.htmlPolitics) General
Paul Nakasone, commander of US Cyber Command, publicly acknowledged that
the military played a role in disrupting ransomware groups targeting
critical infrastructure. [The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has]{.underline} also [worked with other NATO
allies, such
as [Estonia](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2433245/hunt-forward-estonia-estonia-us-strengthen-partnership-in-cyber-domain-with-joi/) and [Montenegro](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/us/politics/cyber-command-hackers-russia.html),
to conduct "hunt forward" cyber operations on allied and partner
networks]{.underline} to uncover and disrupt malicious cyber activity.

[Other NATO allies have also been more transparent about offensive cyber
operations.]{.underline} In 2020, the [United
Kingdom](https://warontherocks.com/2021/05/what-will-britains-new-cyber-force-actually-do/) announced
a significant investment in its National Cyber Force, its organizational
arm for offensive cyber operations, and its [2022 National Cyber
Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-cyber-strategy-2022/national-cyber-security-strategy-2022#contents) emphasized
the role of offensive cyber operations. In November 2021, General
Nakasone and the director of Government Communications
Headquarters---the UK government's principal signals intelligence
agency---[stated](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59335332) jointly
that the two governments were collaborating to "impose consequences" in
cyberspace to disrupt adversary operations. The Netherlands has also
publicly [alluded](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/02/08/the-netherlands-just-revealed-its-cybercapacity-so-what-does-that-mean/) to
conducting offensive cyber operations.

Next Steps: Addressing Challenges and Mitigating Risks

Given the threat environment facing NATO, as well as the activities of
several NATO members, the alliance should deliberately---but
purposefully---consider incorporating offensive cyber operations below
the level of armed conflict into its deterrence strategy. Any effort to
explore a role for offensive cyber operations should also consider the
challenges and risks that may come with doing so. A central challenge is
that, at the political level, [NATO allies **lack consensus** on the
appropriate application of offensive cyber power---especially below the
level of armed conflict. Addressing these disagreements among member
states is essential because conducting offensive cyber operations often
requires maneuvering through or operating on [networks controlled by an
ally or
allies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02684527.2020.1729316).
Right now, NATO members do not
collectively [agree](https://www.lawfareblog.com/nato-allies-need-come-terms-offensive-cyber-operations) on
the [protocols](https://www.iai.it/en/pubblicazioni/cyber-defence-nato-countries-comparing-models) and
processes for partner actions in allied networks---and they also
disagree on how to
define [sovereignty](https://texaslawreview.org/respect-sovereignty-cyberspace/) in
cyberspace, or when an offensive cyber operation would rise to the level
of an armed attack.]{.underline}

[Offensive cyber operations for NATO also present real interoperability
challenges. The role of intelligence in cyber operations is likely to
**complicate NATO planning processes**. **Even close allies** are likely
to be **wary about sharing sensitive intelligence** for a number of
reasons]{.underline}. For instance, they may be averse to sharing
information gleaned from signals intelligence collection or because a
member state may be using the same exploits for both offensive action
and their own espionage---including intelligence collection
against [allies](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-security-agency-spied-merkel-other-top-european-officials-through-danish-2021-05-30/).
Or, allies may simply be worried that sensitive information may become
exposed. [On top of this, it's challenging to adjudicate intelligence
requirements among allies and to deconflict intelligence and military
priorities.]{.underline} It is also not clear whether the alliance has
established consensus thresholds that specify the conditions and
timeline under which a state would have to notify others of its
activities on their networks---if at all.

//AB

The current state and future potential of CBT

[Cognitive Biotechnologies]{.underline} are at present focused on three
main areas of research: biophysical, biochemical and behavioural. The
future direction of these technologies is difficult to predict,
particularly as many are still emerging. But they [have the]{.underline}
[potential to significantly disrupt existing assumptions about the
evolution of civil society, the economy, and military
affairs]{.underline}. It is [therefore in the interest of the Alliance
to closely monitor the rise of those technologie]{.underline}s and
applications that are most likely to affect or disrupt current defence
constructs and doctrine. Moreover, it will be important to direct
early-stage investment into those areas that are particularly promising
for the Alliance, or to those which will most likely impact its
competitiveness.

Biophysical technologies

Advances in the biophysical area centre on brain computer interfaces
(BCI), which can be directly inserted into the human body or via
transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a form of
neuromodulation that uses constant, direct currents delivered via
electrodes on the head, and can be worn or removed at will. While BCI
was originally developed to provide assistive technologies (such as
prosthetic arms and mentally controlled wheelchairs), recent
developments in bi-directionality have allowed for enhanced sensing, for
example, bionic eyes or other enhancements to situational awareness.
Further [applications of these technologies could lead to mental control
of aircraft or ground vehicle systems; mind-guided drones or missiles;
or the mechanisation of soldiers via exoskeletons and advanced
sensors.]{.underline}

At the same time, tDCS [applications have been shown to regulate the
human brain itself, affecting the brain's executive functions, learning
mechanisms, memory, language processing, sensory perception, and motor
functions]{.underline}. Current work with tDCS focuses on recovery from
PTSD and treatment of mental ailments like obsessive compulsive
disorder. But the technology also provides for the possibility of
raising soldiers' cognitive and physical capabilities: to analyse
scenarios more easily and quickly; to retain and retrieve memories with
greater acuity; to modulate perceptions of pain; to improve
psychological self-protection; and to embed muscle memory and motor
skills more quickly. Another [controversial aspect of tDCS is the
potential to look inside the mind of the user]{.underline}, to display
and play back past memories on an external monitor, or even to insert
synthetic memories and images into the mind.

//AB

Ethical issues and responsible use

There are [several ethical considerations for CBT that may transcend
even AI in their complexity]{.underline}. First is the issue of personal
agency. If CBT is able to motivate, enable, and even control human
decision making and action, where does individual responsibility end?
[Are soldiers responsible for their actions when under the influence of
advanced CBT, and under what conditions?]{.underline}

Relatedly, [how does the Alliance ensure that there is sufficient
consent for the use of CBT for individuals tasked to use the
technology?]{.underline} These technologies can be invasive, both
physiologically and mentally, and have the potential to cause harm,
particularly as we do not fully understand their unintended cognitive
and biological consequences.

In addition, [significant privacy concerns will be raised]{.underline}
once these technologies can enter our minds and see our most private
thoughts and memories. What are the limits of such searches? And what
are the protections for physiological and cognitive data, and who may
store and control their dissemination or cause their deletion? More
generally, [what protections will we have against the potential of mind
control, cognitive erasure, and reprogramming?]{.underline}

The [Alliance's success with CBT will depend upon well-designed
principles and practices relating to these ethical
consideration]{.underline}s, since the adoption and integration of these
technologies will be based on the consent and acceptance of Allied
governments and their societies at large. As in the case of AI, the
Alliance and member governments will need to develop principles of
responsible use, addressing such issues as privacy, consent, lawfulness,
responsibility and governability.

### 2nc NATO Unity Prevents Great Power War

#### **NATO is unified now -- prevents great power war** 

**Garamone, 6/16/22** **-- Reporter at the Department of Defense**
\[Jim; 6/16/22 U.S. Department of Defense; "NATO Defense Leaders Set
Stage for Alliance Decisions at Madrid Summit"; accessed 6/23/22;
Lowell-DC\]

Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III joined 29 other NATO defense
ministers in Brussels to set the stage for the alliance\'s Madrid Summit
that will start June 29.

[NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said]{.underline} the [Madrid
Summit of NATO]{.underline} heads of state and government will be a
transformative event [\"at a pivotal time for our
security.\"]{.underline}

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is certainly a transformative event.
[The international rules-based order set up after World War II was
designed to resolve issues peacefully. The order respects sovereignty
and is based on the rule of law.]{.underline}

[It has been successful. There were still small wars, but there was
**nothing approaching**]{.underline} the **[great power
wars]{.underline}** that killed more than 40 million people globally in
the 20th century. [NATO was instrumental in preventing a great power war
with the Soviet Union,]{.underline} and it adjusted after the fall of
the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union to \"export\"
peace.

[Russia\'s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is a direct challenge to this
rules-based order, and NATO must adjust and respond.]{.underline}

\"Since Russia\'s indefensible invasion of Ukraine, we have had to face
events that we all hoped would never come to pass,\" Austin said at the
conclusion of the second day of the NATO Defense Ministerial. \"And this
[alliance has met the challenge with determination, with resolve and,
above all, with **unity**. **Together, we have responded swiftly and
decisively** to Russia\'s baseless, lawless and reckless invasion of
Ukraine.\"]{.underline}

Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said the rules-based order was successful in preventing a great power
war and in preventing large powers from conquering smaller countries
with military force.

But now, \"[Ukraine is under threat. They are at war, and we will
continue to support the]{.underline}m,\" Milley said following a meeting
of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels, June 15. \"But the
[rules-based international order is also under threat due to the actions
of Russia i]{.underline}n the Ukraine.

\"The international community is not allowing this unambiguous act of
aggression by Russia to go unanswered,\" he continued. \"To do so risks
the world returning to an era when large powerful countries can invade
smaller countries at will. That is what the international community is
up against. Since the initiation of hostilities in late February, the
global community has responded in an unprecedented manner.\"

The NATO nations are resolute in opposition to this Russian war. But the
war still changes the calculus in Europe and around the world. Russia is
not the only nation seeking to overturn the rules-based order. China,
too, wants to replace the system even though that system has lifted
China economically. And Austin said the new NATO Strategic Concept keeps
a wary eye on the Indo-Pacific.

Still, the talk of the ministerial concerned Ukraine and the challenge
Russia presents. [The alliance is looking to beef up deterrence and
defense in the Eastern countries of the alliance, Austin
said.]{.underline}

\"During [this enormous crisis in European security, we\'re proud to
**stand together** to strengthen the rules-based international order
that protects us all,\"]{.underline} the secretary said.

[\"Together, we have risen to the challenge of]{.underline} \[President
Vladimir\] [Putin\'s war of choice and Russia\'s assault on
transatlantic security,\"]{.underline} Austin said. \"Our [allies have
activated NATO\'s defense plans]{.underline}. They\'ve deployed elements
of the NATO Response Force. And they\'ve placed tens of thousands of
troops in the eastern areas of the alliance, along with significant air
and naval assets under direct NATO command, supported by allies\'
national deployments.\"

[The alliance is looking to the future and NATO leaders are making
long-term plans to deter and defend every inch of NATO territory. This
is especially aimed at the East, the secretary said.]{.underline}

[Many of the ministers\' recommendations will be presented to NATO
leaders in Madrid]{.underline}. These will include basing decisions, the
footprint of forces throughout the continent, all domain combat and
more.

The secretary said he was pleased with the work the ministers did during
the ministerial but could not elaborate on the decisions. Those will be
ratified later. \"See you in Madrid,\" he told reporters.

### 2nc Unity Key to Defeat Russia

#### **Unity key to ensure Russian defeat** 

**Malinowski, 22 -- vice chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee** \[2/28/22, "Democracy In Danger: The Russian Threat To
Ukraine", Center for Strategic & International Studies,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/democracy-danger-russian-threat-ukraine,
access date 6/19/22 //TJ\]

People ask, why is Putin doing this? I'm sure we'll talk about that a
little bit. And I think it's also become pretty clear. The mask is off
this man. It has nothing to do with any kind of legitimate concerns he
has about Ukraine joining NATO. [There's no military threat from Ukraine
to Russia]{.underline}. Little-known fact of recent history, Ukraine
actually promised not to join NATO in 2010. [They passed a resolution in
their parliament, a resolution of neutrality, that they would join no
military blocs, whether led by Russia or by the United States. And four
years later, in 2014, Russia invaded them anyway, because -- well,
because they had overthrown a corrupt Putin-type, Putin-style leader,
and established a much more healthy and vibrant democracy.]{.underline}

That's what threatens Putin above all, that these people who do share a
lot of kinship with Russians and a lot of history, who are very close
by, who he believes are part of his sphere of influence, have set an
example for the Russian people that you can boot out a corrupt and
authoritarian leader, because they're choosing to align themselves with
Europeans. They want to be part of the European Union. That is actually
much more threatening to Putin than NATO membership. And so he's just
decided that Ukraine doesn't have a right to exist, unless it's
completely subjugated by Russia. That's what he's fighting for here.

And I think that is -- it's both awful and evil, but it's also a
weakness for Putin, because it's not an obsession. His obsession with
ending Ukraine as a country, with reconstituting the Soviet Union, is
not an obsession I think that most Russians share. I think it may not
even be an obsession that most Russian officials working for Putin
share. If you -- if anybody caught that surreal meeting of the Russian
national security council that Putin staged just before the invasion, in
which he humiliated his own officials and forced them to, in effect, ask
him to do this thing on live television, they didn't look very happy.
(Laughs.) They didn't look like this is -- this is where they would be
leading their country at this moment.

So I think, you know, [although the Russian military has enormous
strength compared to the Ukrainians, they clearly have superiority on
the battlefield. They're probably going to win a lot of tactical
victories]{.underline}. They may take the capital of Kyiv, and all of
that will be awful, I do think that strategically our side has more
advantages than the Russian side**. [As long as we're
unified]{.underline}** [across the Atlantic, as long as we're unified
within the United States, as long as we understand the stakes and have
the staying power to stand by the Ukrainians through what could be a
long and difficult fight, I think a tactical victory for Putin could
turn into a **very significant strategic defeat**. And that needs to be
out goal.]{.underline} Thank you so much.

### 2nc Unity Prevent Miscalc

#### NATO unity and military strategy prevents Russian miscalc and escalation

Joint Press Availability";

accessed 6/21/22; Lowell-DC\]

SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: Thank you so much, Secretary Blinken,
dear Tony. It's great to see you again, and thank you for your strong
personal engagement for our transatlantic bond in this pivotal time for
our security. And this is very much reflected in your frequent visits to
Brussels. You are welcome back there again, but now I really appreciate
this opportunity to meet with you here in Washington.

The [United States is playing an indispensible role in our response to
Russia's invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline} Now, let me commend the
United States for your very significant support to Ukraine, which is
making a difference on the battlefield every day. I also welcome the
latest package of military assistance announced by President Biden this
morning. This is a demonstration of real U.S. leadership. [The strong
support provided by NATO and Allies helps ensure that]{.underline}
President [Putin's brutal aggression is not rewarded, and that Ukraine
prevails.]{.underline}

At the same time, we must prevent the conflict from escalating, so [we
have increased our presence in the eastern part of the Alliance to
**remove any room for miscalculation** in Moscow about NATO's readiness
and determination to defend and protect all NATO Allies.]{.underline}

Let me thank the United States for [increasing your military presence
across Europe]{.underline}, with over [100,000 troops backed by
significant air and naval power]{.underline}. [European allies and
Canada are also stepping up with more troops, high readiness, and
increased defense spending]{.underline}. For the [seventh consecutive
year, defense spending has increased, and more and more Allies are
meeting our guideline of spending 2 percent of GDP on
defense.]{.underline}

President Putin wanted less NATO. He is getting [more NATO, more troops,
and more NATO members.]{.underline}

The decisions by [Finland and Sweden]{.underline} to apply for NATO
membership are historic, and they [will strengthen our
Alliance.]{.underline} We have to address the security concerns of all
Allies, and [I'm confident that we will find the united way
forward]{.underline}.

To this end, I'm in close contact with President Erdoğan of Turkey and
with the leaders of Finland and Sweden. And I will convene senior
officials from all three countries in Brussels in the coming days.

Today, we also discussed the important decisions we will take at the
NATO summit in Madrid later this month. We will [agree NATO's next
Strategic Concept, strengthen our deterrence and defense, and prepare
for an age of increased strategic competition with authoritarian powers
like Russia]{.underline} and China. This includes [working even more
closely with our partners]{.underline} in the Asia-Pacific and other
likeminded partners around the world.

We will also review [progress on burden-sharing.]{.underline} We must
continue to invest in our defense and to [invest in NATO because only
North America and Europe, working together in a strong NATO, can keep
our 1 billion people safe in a more dangerous world]{.underline}.

So Secretary Blinken, dear Tony, once again, thank you so much.

### 2nc Turns China and Iran

#### **Failure to effectively defend Ukraine will greenlight Iran and Chinese invasion of Taiwan** 

**Malinowski & Lohsen 22** -- vice chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee and fellow in the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, AND \*\*fellow in the
Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies \[ 2/28/22, Representative Tom Malinowski (D-NJ),
Andrew Lohsen, "Democracy In Danger: The Russian Threat To Ukraine",
Center for Strategic & International Studies,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/democracy-danger-russian-threat-ukraine,
access date 6/19/22 //TJ\]

Rep. Malinowski: There will be bipartisan support for whatever needs to
happen. The president simply needs to ask, and I think that will be
provided. You know, we'll have to see how the crisis unfolds, what the
needs are. Certainly, we want to continue to provide military support to
the Ukrainians. And if the president needs any additional preparations
to enable that to happen, I'm sure that that will be forthcoming from
Congress. We are ready to act and I think united on the principles, no
matter what the partisan talking points may be on cable news.

Mr. Lohsen: I think that's really reassuring to know, for those of us
who care about Ukraine, and for the Ukrainians who are experiencing the
conflict firsthand and in real time. One of the questions that I keep
asking myself is how to kind of communicate why this is important to
ordinary Americans who simply think that this is a conflict that's far
away from home, that the U.S. doesn't have a dog in the fight, that it's
better just to stay out and let the Europeans handle it themselves. How
do you respond to that? How is this an issue that Americans should care
about?

Rep. Malinowski: That was the case I tried to make, that we -- America
helped build a world in which borders are not changed by force. And, you
know, we -- there are very few Americans still alive who have a memory
of the Second World War, but I think it's still part of our collective
memory as a country. And [we know what a mistake it was to let Hitler
invade Czechoslovakia just because it was a tiny country far away that
had nothing to do with us. And we never again want to learn that lesson
the hard way, as we did in -- when Pearl Harbor was
attacked]{.underline} in 1941.

[**China's watching this.** China has designs on Taiwan]{.underline}, as
we all know, [and potentially other countries in its region. **Iran is
watching this.** We absolutely **do not want to send a signal** to these
aggressive powers that anything goes now -- that the United States is no
longer a serious country, that we're no longer the head of a serious
alliance that is willing to do its part to deter that kind of
aggression.]{.underline}

And remember, we're not being asked to fight. We're not being asked to
send troops. First thing that President Zelensky of Ukraine said to us
when we met with him three weeks ago was: We do not need you to send a
single American soldier to fight for Ukraine. We will do the fighting
ourselves. We will protect our country. We just need you to be on our
side, to help us with material support, to use your economic power to
punish Russia. That's all that's being asked of us here. It's not a lot.

And **[our European allies are with us]{.underline}**. In fact, they're
going to shoulder a much greater share of the burden, because they're
the ones who are going to be taking refugees. They're the ones who are
going to suffer the consequences of Russia's energy blackmail. I mean,
Germans are going to be paying twice as much for heating, for heating
their homes, because of this. And they're willing to do it. So they're
willing to do that. We should be willing to do our part.

Mr. Lohsen: Now, one of the things that I also wanted to make sure that
we had a chance to discuss was the democracy agenda, and what this means
for the U.S. interest in supporting transitioning democracies around the
world. Since the revolution of dignity in 2014, the cornerstone of U.S.
support for Ukraine has been anti-corruption and governance assistance,
and to help Ukraine transition into a more open society and a more fully
functioning democracy. And yet, it seems now it's being punished by
Russia for pursuing those aspirations. So how do we take that into
consideration as we -- as we consider trying to promote open societies
around the world and defend democracies from this new wave of
authoritarianism?

Rep. Malinowski: Ukrainians didn't start fighting corruption or building
a democracy because we told them to, because we wanted them to. It's
what they want to do. (Laughs.) It's how people want to live in any
normal society in the world. We supported them in making that choice. We
provided them with assistance and encouragement. But this was their
chosen path. And their commitment to that chosen path only got stronger
the more the Russians tried to stop them.

And I think that there's probably no people in the world today, on
Friday February 25th, who are more committed to pursuing that path than
the people of Ukraine, precisely because of what Russia is doing to
them. So, look, we have to be on the side of the good guys here. We
stand up to bullies. [We stand up for democracy]{.underline}. That's who
we are. That's our identity. That's why people all around the world
rally to our side when we need them in a crisis. And we're going to
continue to do that.

Mr. Lohsen: I'd like to turn now to a couple of questions from the
audience. We've gotten some excellent questions in our Q&A. And one of
them is, you know, building on this question, again, about what the
current invasion means in the long run for democracies elsewhere. But
there's a specific focus on what this means for Taiwan and other
countries -- democracies that are imperiled by much larger neighbors who
think that they can now enforce a might by right principle -- or, right
by might principle -- excuse me. Pushing, you know, other countries
around just to build spheres of influence. How would you respond to
that? And what the United States can be doing, and the collective West
can be doing, for other countries that are really looking for that
reassurance?

Rep. Malinowski: Well, all these situations are a little bit different,
but I think fundamentally it's the same principle. And so, yes, [the
people of Taiwan are watching this very closely]{.underline}. And [I'm
sure they feel a strong sense of kinship with Ukrainians right now.

### AT: Russia Not a Threat

#### **Still high risk of escalation even after Kyiv battle -- include nuclear use -- NATO can't afford to take a break** 

**Gramer MacKinnon 22 -- diplomacy and national security reporter
at Foreign Policy** \[6/7/22, "NATO Allies Are Rethinking Russia's
Supposed Military Prowess But Russia's early military failures in
Ukraine don't make it any less dangerous, military analysts warn.",
Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/07/ukraine-nato-allies-rethinking-russia-military-prowess/
//TJ\]

There are two major assumptions that defense planners in major NATO
capitals got wrong for years, [former NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh
Rasmussen said]{.underline} in an interview with [Foreign
Policy](about:blank). First, Rasmussen said, "we have overestimated the
strength of the Russian military. Despite huge investments in military
equipment and the reopening of old Soviet bases, we have seen a very
weak Russian military."

["The other miscalculation is we have underestimated the brutality and
the ambitions of]{.underline} President \[Vladimir\]
[Putin]{.underline}," Rasmussen added.

Now, in capitals in Europe and North America, wonks in defense
ministries are dusting off years-old assessments of the Russian
military's fighting prowess and starting to question long-held
assumptions on what a conventional war between NATO members and Russia
would look like.

"Whether it was morale or communications or lack of preparedness,
there's a bunch of factors that have added up to something that you just
wouldn't expect to see from an advanced military," Skaluba said of the
Russian forces, "even if the initial conditions or assumptions under
which they went in \[to Ukraine\] were invalidated."

One possible scenario that NATO militaries had long prepared for is a
rapid land-grab of the Baltic states, on NATO's vulnerable eastern
flank. NATO members had planned and prepared exercises to take those
countries back from Russian forces---presuming that Russia could quickly
overwhelm their militaries and capture the territory in the first place.

After seeing how poorly Russian troops fared against Ukraine's forces,
some U.S. and other Western defense planners are pushing NATO to
reassess that plan: It seems more feasible that, with the proper size
and combination of alliance forces, command structures, and military
hardware in the Baltics, they could effectively deter or, if not,
withstand and repel an invasion by Russian forces. On the flip side, a
Russian attempt to invade NATO territory in the Baltics also suddenly
seems like a much less unlikely scenario.

[Baltic leaders are expected to propose that [NATO expand its
footprint](about:blank) in the region at the upcoming NATO summit in
Madrid in late June.]{.underline} If enacted, Baltic officials say, [the
upgrade in NATO forces could act as a more effective form of "deterrence
by denial" against Putin preparing any plans to seize Baltic
territory]{.underline}. After having seen U.S. intelligence on the
impending Russian invasion borne out, Baltic nations are hoping that
laggards like France and Germany will sign onto their plan.

"We're still not giving them what they want," one U.S. source told
Foreign Policy.

[With relations between NATO and Russia at their most precarious point
in the post-Cold War era, some analysts feel it is time to start drawing
preliminary conclusions for what a NATO-Russia conflict might look like,
in the event that the Ukraine conflict spills into alliance territory.
"The risk of escalation still remains, so it's prudent for NATO planners
to be thinking about what a potential conflict between NATO and Russia
could look like," said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former senior U.S.
intelligence official]{.underline} now with the Center for a New
American Security, a think tank.

[Skaluba, Kendall-Taylor, and other military analysts caution that the
**war in Ukraine is far from over**, and **it's possible Russia could
learn to adapt and improve its military**, particularly as it works to
shake off the sting from its defeats in northern Ukraine and capture
territories in eastern Ukraine. "We've already seen a capable Russian
force in places like Georgia and Syria and now a bit more so in
Ukraine," said Skaluba, who is now director of the Atlantic Council's
Transatlantic Security Initiative]{.underline}. "I can't believe that
really pitiful performance we saw for a few months \[in Ukraine\] is
reflective of the entire Russian military."

Precise numbers on the casualties in the war on both sides are hard to
verify, but it's clear that Russia has already incurred staggering
losses. Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky [asserted](about:blank) that some 30,000 Russian service
members have been killed, while the British government estimates that
number could be closer to 15,000. But Moscow still has massive reserves
of military personnel and conscripts, even if they are poorly trained
and equipped, and has shown no intention of backing down from the war.

The war has had two distinct phases thus far: an initial assault on
Kyiv, based on the highly flawed political assumption that the Ukrainian
government would collapse within days, and the ongoing fight in the
Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Russia's top military brass have
exerted more influence over operations.

"In the early phases of the war, the bigger problem was the plan rather
than the army," said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military
with CNA, a think tank. "Now we're in a phase where we're much more able
to evaluate the Russian army."

In the buildup to the war, there was a broad consensus in the West that
if Russia were to launch an all-out attack, Ukrainian military
resistance would quickly crumble. Ukraine's stiff and effective
resistance proved everyone wrong, from Putin to many defense planners in
Washington. But drawing direct lessons from the conflict for NATO can be
tricky due to the vast number of variables involved.

"There is no such thing as a general NATO-Russia fight," Kofman said.
"It depends where, under what conditions, the plans, war aims, and
assumptions truly matter. This isn't a thing that exists in the
abstract."

[Any potential conflict between Russia and NATO]{.underline}, however
unlikely, [could also quickly escalate beyond what is playing out in
Ukraine---a fight between land forces---and **heighten the risk of
Russia drawing on its untested nuclear arsenal**, said]{.underline} Jim
[Townsend, another former Pentagon official and expert on trans-Atlantic
security. "There is a lot of the Russian military capability that has
not been touched by this war nor been tested by this war," he
said.]{.underline}

[Townsend also argued that NATO shouldn't assume that a smaller size of
better trained and better equipped NATO forces would be able to hold its
own against a larger Russian invading force. In other words, just
because Russia's military stumbled out of the gate in Ukraine doesn't
mean NATO shouldn't breathe easy.]{.underline}

["Yes, \[Russia\] made some stupid assumptions which cascaded in a lot
of bad ways, and we made some stupid assumptions about their military
modernization program," he said. "There's a lot of reasons why we could
fool ourselves right now into thinking the Russians really suck. ... But
we're going to be dealing with a **wounded bear who is still very
dangerous**."]{.underline}

### AT: Ukraine Will Lose Inevitably 

#### There is still hope for Ukraine to win against Russia

**Engelbrekt, 6/3**/2022 \-\-- **military expert and professor at the
Swedish Defense University in Stockholm** (June 03, 2022 05:50 GMT,

For Finland, Sweden\'s NATO Bids?"
<https://www.rferl.org/a/sweden-finland-nato-bids-interview/31880579.html>,
LKK)

RFE/RL: Changing the subject now to Ukraine, what's your assessment of
where things currently stand? Russia is making some steady gains in the
Donbas, but can they hold these new areas and should we expect some
Ukrainian counteroffensives at some point?\
Engelbrekt: I think it\'s a matter of priority for the Ukrainian side.\
[Russia announced in February before it invaded that it would formally
recognize the administrative areas of]{.underline} the two so-called
[people\'s republics in Donetsk and Luhansk and they would try to
capture them. So if I were in Kyiv right now I might give higher
priority to consolidating my positions in the south and if I do
counteroffensives,]{.underline} I\'d do them there. So it\'s a matter of
priorities \-- military and political \-- for the Ukrainian side.\
Looking ahead, [manpower issues loom large for both Kyiv and Moscow.
Troops in each army are exhausted, but the morale on the Ukrainian side
still appears to be very high.]{.underline} So I think [it will be
possible for the Ukrainians to train fresh troops and move them in. But
that looks to be a more difficult challenge for the
Russians,]{.underline} especially in the longer term. I think morale is
really low on the Russian side. [If there are continued deliveries of
Western military equipment to the Ukrainians, they may at some point
have the **wherewithal to challenge Russian positions**.]{.underline}\
But again, I think it\'s an issue of priorities for them. They would
probably try and mop up the Russian forces in the north and then they
would want to move in and around Kherson in the south before they make a
move on Luhansk and Donetsk, where it seems like there is also a deep
political commitment from Moscow to capture and hold those positions.

### 2nc Expansion Solves Russian War

#### NATO expansion will generate [internal pressure]{.underline} on Putin to change course and moderate its foreign policy

**Mitchell, 22 -- senior advisor for the Russia and Europe Center at
USIP** \[A. Wess, May 26,United States Institute of Peace, "Putin's War
Backfires as Finland, Sweden Seek to Join NATO; The Russian autocrat
aimed to check NATO's expansion but has instead strengthened the
alliance,"

Acc 6/23/22, HO\]

What are the short-term implications of NATO expansion, specifically for
the war in Ukraine? Could it prolong the war or compel Putin to take
desperate measures, like deploying WMDs?

The decision by Finland and Sweden to apply for NATO membership
demonstrates the unintended consequences for Putin of his war in
Ukraine. While his immediate objective was to defeat and subjugate
Ukraine, he also wanted to create a kind of demonstration effect of
Russian strength and, as the pre-war Russian diplomatic note made plain,
push NATO back from Russia's borders. The war has achieved exactly the
opposite. Now, [Russia will have even more NATO presence on its borders,
both through the addition of hundreds of miles of NATO territory to the
Russian frontier, and through the deployment of Western troop presence
in Central Europe. So, the war is backfiring for Putin not only
militarily but geopolitically.]{.underline}

[The immediate implication is that Putin will have to give military
attention to Russia's northwestern flank at a moment when he needs all
the firepower he can muster for the conflict in Ukraine.]{.underline}
Rather than prolonging the war, if anything, [NATO's Nordic expansion
could shorten it by increasing the military demands on
Russia]{.underline}. Politically, [it may **increase the pressure on
Putin** from within the Russian elite to **alter course**, since it is a
further illustration, alongside the effects of sanctions and losses in
the war itself, of the costs of his aggressive foreign
policy.]{.underline} Remember, Putin's central value proposition, and
the key to his legitimacy in the eyes of the Russian elite, is his claim
to military competence --- specifically, the ability to be able to
rebuild Russian power and prestige by the effective use of the military.
[If the war exposes that as a fiction, as it is now doing, and also
amasses sufficient geopolitical, economic and political costs along the
way, then Putin's value proposition as a leader is **seriously eroded in
Kremlin circles**, and among the Russian populace as well.]{.underline}

#### NATO expansion is the only way to prevent Russia expansion 

**[KLVAŇA](about:blank) 22 -- former press secretary and policy adviser
to the president of the Czech Republic and visiting professor at New
York University Prague** \[2/25/22, "The Real Reasons Putin Feels
Threatened by NATO", *The Bulwark*,
[https://www.thebulwark.com/the-real-reasons-putin-feels-threatened-by-nato/](about:blank),
accessed 6/18/22 //TJ\]

[The most prominent pretext Vladimir Putin has used for his full-scale
invasion of Ukraine is the [NATO membership promised to Ukraine and
Georgia in 2008](about:blank). Putin has said again and again that NATO
is a threat to Russia,]{.underline} and demanded, in December and again
in his pre-war ultimatum this week, that the alliance roll back its
troops to where they were in 1997, two years before NATO expanded to
Central Europe. In this, he is in a way supported by some respected
American foreign policy commentators---Tom Friedman, John Mearsheimer,
and others---who have dusted off their mid-'90s realist arguments
against enlarging NATO, and are claiming vindication today. To support
his case, [Friedman [recently referenced](about:blank) the]{.underline}
late George Kennan's [well-known opposition to accepting new members
into the alliance]{.underline}, quoting things Kennan told him [back in
1998](about:blank). None of these critics, of course, approves of
Russia's aggression, but there is an I-told-you-so element to their
argument.

[Here is why they are wrong.]{.underline}

[Putin is correct when he says NATO is a danger to him, but not in the
way you think. Putin knows that NATO does not pose a military threat to
Moscow.]{.underline} He has the same information about NATO tanks,
armored vehicles, missiles, and troops in Europe as we all do. He knows
that NATO is a defensive alliance that would never attack his country
unprovoked. He opposed NATO for the same reason he opposed deploying
U.S. antimissile defenses in Central Europe 15 years ago: He knew well
then they were not aimed at Russia, but were to defend the continent
from an attack by at most several ballistic missiles coming from the
Middle East, for example from Iran or a rogue terrorist group. Nothing
will protect Europe from a massive Russian missile attack. But Putin
opposed the stationing of the tracking radar and kinetic missiles in the
Czech Republic and Poland because he did not want to have any U.S.
military installations there.

[Why, then, did Putin oppose the antimissile defenses if he knew they
were not a military threat? Because they were a political threat. When a
country gets a U.S. military base on its territory, it will not have a
Russian base there. Putin rejects NATO in Central and Eastern Europe
because he himself wants to be there---in some cases directly, such as
now in Ukraine, and later possibly in the Baltics; in other cases
indirectly, like in the Czech Republic or Hungary, by bribing local
politicians, spreading his economic influence and covert intelligence
operations. These things are much harder to do in a NATO member state
than in a Finlandized zone of "neutrality."]{.underline}

#### **NATO expansion challenges Russian anti-democratic moves -- need to act now**

**[KLVAŇA](about:blank) 22 -- former press secretary and policy adviser
to the president of the Czech Republic and visiting professor at New
York University Prague** \[2/25/22, "The Real Reasons Putin Feels
Threatened by NATO", *The Bulwark*,
[https://www.thebulwark.com/the-real-reasons-putin-feels-threatened-by-nato/](about:blank),
accessed 6/18/22 //TJ\]

[Another well-known reason for Putin's attack is his fear that Ukraine
might have evolved into a stable, prosperous democracy and as such would
be a role model for the pro-Western democratic opposition in Russia. He
acts now based on what to him is a rational calculation of his own
interests in his own political survival: He does not want to end up in
prison, or even blindfolded standing against a brick wall.]{.underline}

What foreign policy realists do not understand---or do not want to
understand---is that even [if NATO had not been enlarged to include
countries in Central and Eastern Europe, there would be a very good
chance that Putin would still behave the way he does today. There would
be one difference---his political playground in Central Europe would be
larger than it is today. Corruption would be an order of magnitude
higher, instability would deter foreign investment, and the living
standard of citizens]{.underline} of Warsaw, Prague, Vilnius,
Bratislava, and Budapest, which is now close to Western standards (the
Czechs are richer than the Spaniards and the Portuguese, and are quickly
catching up to the Italians), [would have been significantly lower,
essentially similar to today's Ukraine,]{.underline} which never got the
chance to integrate with Europe.

[NATO and EU enlargement have been the most successful European policies
in the last three decades. The lives of the hundred million people in
the former Communist states now in NATO and EU have been---despite the
current difficulties---immensely improved. If we heeded the "realists"
and decided "not to poke the sleeping Russian bear," as they liked to
say, and had not enlarged NATO, which provides for security, stability,
and therefore also prosperity, the lives of the hundred million would
have been much worse. And in exchange for what exactly? For
the hope that Russia would successfully transition, ditch its
historically entrenched imperialist expansionism, and become more
Western? Does that sound realistic to you?]{.underline}

#### Ukraine conflict limits Putin's likely response to NATO membership \-\-- signs of aggression will just solidify NATO

**Mitchell, 22 -- senior advisor for the Russia and Europe Center at
USIP** \[A. Wess, May 26,United States Institute of Peace, "Putin's War
Backfires as Finland, Sweden Seek to Join NATO; The Russian autocrat
aimed to check NATO's expansion but has instead strengthened the
alliance,"
<https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/05/putins-war-backfires-finland-sweden-seek-join-nato>,
Acc 6/23/22, HO\]

Aside from immediate measures and threats (e.g., cutting off energy
supplies to Finland, Putin's threat of a "technical military" response),
how do you expect Putin to respond if Finland and Sweden formally join
NATO?

Putin's dilemma is that he has to respond in some way to Finland's and
Sweden's NATO moves to avoid seeming weak, yet he has few obvious or
effective response options. For years he has threatened both countries
that joining NATO would lead to negative consequences, so he can't
afford to not respond in some fashion. [The easiest response is to cut
energy exports, as he has done. But both countries can diversify energy
sources without excessively straining their economies. Militarily,
Putin's usual response would be to send Russian conventional forces to
the border with Finland and to deploy Russian planes and ships to the
eastern Baltic. But he needs all the military power he can get in
Ukraine.]{.underline}

[So, Putin's most likely response will be to deploy missiles to the
border with Finland and to Kaliningrad. Russia possesses a large nuclear
arsenal, including numerous low-yield, or tactical, nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} [Putin is likely to deploy such weapons in a way
that plays to Finnish and Swedish fears that entering NATO will trigger
an aggressive Russian response]{.underline}. He is aware that there are
strong pacifist traditions in both countries. In the old days, stoking
those dynamics by aggressive moves to create pressure on Finnish and
Swedish governments might have had its desired effect. But [doing so now
is only likely to increase Finnish and Swedish support for NATO
membership, given what they've seen happening in Ukraine. That's what
war does --- it creates fear, and fear leads peaceful nations to seek
security through alliances.]{.underline}

### 2nc NATO Expansion Stabilizes Europe & Improves Hybrid Threat Response 

#### Finland and Sweden accession improves NATO on [total defense]{.underline} and [hybrid threats]{.underline} -- will make Baltics and all of Europe more stable

**Berzina, 22 -- senior fellow and head of the geopolitics team at the
Alliance for Securing Democracy** \[5-19-2022, GMF \"What Can NATO Learn
from Finland and Sweden?"
https://www.gmfus.org/news/finland-and-sweden-apply-join-nato-whats-next,
accessed on 6-18-2022, LKK\]

[Finland and Sweden's decisions to seek NATO membership are tremendous
developments in European security]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} also
[long-overdue steps to **codify a security and defense position** that
has been emerging for decades.]{.underline} [Russia may want to portray
the northern Baltic in Cold War terms of neutrality, as standing apart
from NATO. But Finland and Sweden are EU member states, have been close
partners of NATO for years,]{.underline} and are members of the United
Kingdom-led Joint Expeditionary Force that as recently as this year has
exercised together. [Finland, Sweden, and NATO view the world in very
similar terms, and on **many aspects of total defense and hybrid
threats**, the two countries have much to teach the
alliance.]{.underline}

Why is there this alignment in security outlook? [The history of
Russia's aggression is not forgotten, especially in Finland, where the
success of the Winter War protected the country from the occupation that
befell its southern Baltic neighbors. Russia's threats and heavily armed
presence are still very much present in the Baltic region.]{.underline}
It may be uncomfortable for those NATO allies who focus on threats in
the south, like Spain and Italy, to think about Russia's forces and
missiles in Kaliningrad, wedged between NATO members Poland and
Lithuania, and to ponder the very small distance separating this Russian
territory from Gotland in Sweden. [But Finland and Sweden have faced
down this threat for decades, vowing to protect themselves and building
capabilities to counter this ever-present, untrusted
neighbor.]{.underline}

[Finland and Sweden joining the alliance will **make the Baltic Sea
region and all of Europe safer** with new capabilities, **closer
coordination**, and **faster decision-making**. The two countries have
developed approaches to total defense, or comprehensive security, that
draw on their societies to provide **resilience**, **situational
awareness**, and **cohesion** in times of peace, tension, and
war]{.underline}. [The willingness to break down barriers between
government institutions and use the resourcefulness of their populations
are lessons all NATO members should learn.]{.underline}

### 2nc Expansion Improves NATO Air / Maritime / Cyber

accessed on 6-18-2022, LKK\]

[The prospect of NATO membership for Finland and Sweden is an
**operational blessing for the alliance**]{.underline}. Both countries
bring substantial military assets and expertise. [Their membership would
create much needed strategic depth, essential to the defense of the
Baltic states and the air and maritime space in the region. As
longstanding NATO partners, **interoperability will not be an
issue**]{.underline}. By virtue of their history and geography,
Stockholm and Helsinki have always been well placed as centers for
intelligence and analysis on Russia. One of the many lessons of the
Ukraine war so far has been that formal security guarantees matter.
[Having Finland and Sweden "in" removes any ambiguity about their place
in Europe's collective defense]{.underline}.

In broader strategic terms, too, [**the benefits** of this new
enlargement **are clear**. The alliance does acquire a much longer
border with Russia. But set against the heightened ability to **defend
alliance interests in the air, maritime, and cyber domains**, including
in the high north, the net exposure should not be a
concern.]{.underline} And transatlantic partners were already
stakeholders in Finland's territorial defense.

### AT: Expansion Hurts NATO

#### Finland and Sweden will productively contribute to NATO by performing important functions

**Poast 22 -- associate professor in the Department of Political Science
at the University of Chicago** \[Paul Poast, June 7, 2022,
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace "What NATO Needs to Do Before
Finland and Sweden Join"

Acc 6/18/22 ER\]

[Finland and Sweden]{.underline} have now applied for NATO membership,
and the process of bringing them on as full members of the alliance is
accelerating into what may become the quickest turnaround ever. Research
by international relations scholars (including me) suggests that the
alliance needs to work out and agree on a military plan for defending
them as soon as possible---before the two Nordic countries join.

On the one hand, there are plenty of reasons why the two nations [have a
strong case to join]{.underline} the alliance. Finland brings much to
the [NATO]{.underline} table. [Prior to the war in Ukraine, Finnish
defense spending]{.underline}, as a percentage of GDP, [was]{.underline}
already [moving toward NATO's 2 percent target, with further increases
planned]{.underline}. [Finland also has a conscription
policy]{.underline}, which is often seen to demonstrate to allies a
strong commitment to self-defense against a potential Russian attack.
Similarly, [Sweden has long worked with NATO, including covert
cooperation during the Cold War and assistance with peacekeeping
operations]{.underline} thereafter. Since the defense of Finland is a
pillar of Sweden's defense policy, it also is sensible for Stockholm to
follow its neighbor into the alliance. Since [both nations are EU
members]{.underline}, one could argue that [they]{.underline}
essentially [gave up their military neutrality long ago]{.underline}.
Moreover, [both]{.underline} nations [are strong democracies, a core
principle of the alliance]{.underline} (if not always followed in
practice).

#### Finland's military has international experience -- can significantly help NATO

**Ossa 22 -- Researcher at the Finnish National Defence University**
\[[HELJÄ](https://warontherocks.com/author/helja-ossa/), MAY 9, 2022,

<https://warontherocks.com/2022/05/what-would-finland-bring-to-the-table-for-nato/>
Acc. 6/23/22 ER\]

Although military defense is its main task, the [Finnish Defence Forces
have taken an active role in international crisis
management]{.underline} too. Being an active and cooperative partner is
of course important, but ultimately the underlying reason for
participating in international operations is to ensure Finland's safety.
[Finland currently has a total of 300 crisis management and peacekeeping
troops deployed in Lebanon, Kosovo, Iraq, Mali, Somalia, the
Mediterranean, and the Middle East]{.underline}. [By
participating]{.underline} in international operations since the 1950s,
[Finland has proved its willingness to play its part in international
security]{.underline}. Moreover, the experience gained in such
operations has had a positive impact on Finnish forces' ability to
cooperate with partner countries even in demanding environments.

As Finland has thus far chosen to remain outside of NATO, it has looked
for [other forms of defense cooperation, the most important of which is
the bilateral relationship with]{.underline} its western neighbor
[Sweden]{.underline}. [Finland and Sweden have no mutual defense
obligations but have agreed on cooperation]{.underline} in areas ranging
from host-nation support to combined joint military operations, and from
the common use of resources to territorial surveillance. [Trilateral
cooperation with Sweden and Norway is also gaining new significance.
Strong Nordic defense cooperation is advantageous for NATO too. Should
Finland and Sweden join the alliance, not only would NATO's presence in
Baltic Sea region be strengthened, but also the same would be true in
the Arctic]{.underline}.

[Finland takes part in several framework-nation cooperation
forums]{.underline}, such as the Joint Expeditionary Force, European
Intervention Initiative, and Framework Nation Concept. Again,
[cooperation with]{.underline} likeminded [partner countries is valuable
on many levels]{.underline}, but for Finland the main advantage is to
maintain peace and stability in the Baltic Sea region and to guarantee
Finland's capability to defend its sovereignty. In practice, defense
cooperation allows better training opportunities, material cooperation,
information exchange, and collaboration in research and development ---
all very valuable advantages for a small country with limited resources.

The Remnants of Non-Alignment?

When discussing Finland's role in European security, one cannot escape
the topic of whether Finland is still a neutral or militarily
non-aligned country, or neither. It is safe to say that [Finland has not
been a neutral country for over 30 years. Finland and Sweden joined
NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 1994 and the European Union in
1995, which tied them to the Western community]{.underline} once and for
all. Still, in political rhetoric throughout the 1990s and early 2000s
Finland maintained its role as a militarily non-aligned country.

[As Finland's cooperation with NATO]{.underline} deepened [and the
European Unio]{.underline}n assumed new roles in security and defense,
[Finland's position as a militarily non-aligned country was
questioned]{.underline} both nationally and internationally. Finland is
one of NATO's Enhanced Opportunity partners and it has engaged
extensively in the NATO Planning and Review Process since 1995, aiming
to promote the development of forces and capabilities by partners who
are best able to cooperate with NATO allies. Moreover, [Finland has
taken part in several NATO-led crisis management operations, and is
regularly invited to NATO meetings]{.underline}, particularly since the
beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian war. In February 2022, Finland took
part in NATO's Cold Response exercise in Norway with 680 personnel, of
whom 470 were conscripts. [As for the European Union, Finland has been
one of the most active member states in the development of the Common
Security and Defence Policy]{.underline} in recent years [and has
stressed the Union's responsibilities as a security
community]{.underline}, reminding fellow member states that they have
agreed on mutual defense (Treaty on European Union, Article 42.7).

Never Again Alone

The idea that Finland needs to be able defend itself is deeply rooted in
Finnish society and strategic culture. Cooperation with other countries
is extremely valuable, but ultimately the defense of the country lies in
the hands of the Finns. National defense is not something that can be
outsourced.

[Finland has been on NATO's threshold for a long time, and it is often
said that Finland is as close to NATO as a country can be without being
an actual member]{.underline}. Still, Finland has not thought it
necessary to take the final step to seek alliance membership, until now.
The speed at which public opinion towards NATO changed after the Russian
attack on Ukraine is unprecedented. Equally impressive is the rapidity
with which the Finnish government has responded to this change of heart
--- something that has also been criticized, especially among the
minority opposing Finnish NATO membership.

#### NATO expansion to Finland and Sweden is key to [transatlantic solidary]{.underline} and bolstering democratic governance in the alliance

**Beitsch, 22** (4-16-2022, Rebecca, \"Russia pushes Finland, Sweden
into NATO's arms,\" Hill; DOA: 4-18-2022,

SMTX//BSA)

[Finland and Sweden appear to be edging closer to joining
NATO]{.underline}, [a move that leaders and experts see as the **best
way to confront Russia** as it escalates its rhetoric on nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}

[The conflict in Ukraine has forced the two Nordic nations to reconsider
their absence from the alliance forged after World War II, which commits
members to defending one another if attacked.]{.underline}

"Mr. [Putin is proving NATO relevant and necessary]{.underline}," said
Sean Monaghan, a visiting fellow with the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"[If NATO didn't exist, you'd have to invent it.]{.underline}"

"[Finland in particular but also Sweden]{.underline} are very stoic on
these matters and [see Russia with clear eyes.]{.underline} And that's
why [I think ultimately they will join NATO because they've seen
Russia's revisionist threat has been building. And now it has boiled
over with the invasion of Ukraine, and there's kind of no way back, and
the best way for them to secure themselves against the threat posed by
Russia is to join NATO."]{.underline}

As politicians and poll results in the two countries have reversed
course on the prospect --- favoring joining NATO after decades of
abstaining --- Moscow has renewed its threat of using nuclear weapons.

Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council and
former president of Russia, wrote in a Telegram post on Thursday that
"there can be no talk of non-nuclear status for the Baltic" if Finland
and Sweden join NATO, adding that "the balance must be restored."

He said that should Finland and Sweden become part of the alliance,
Moscow would need to "seriously strengthen the grouping of land forces
and air defense, deploy significant naval forces in the waters of the
Gulf of Finland."

[It's a particularly concerning threat to Finland]{.underline}, which
shares an 800-mile border with Russia.

Finnish Minister for European Affairs Tytti [Tuppurainen
said]{.underline} Friday that [it is "highly likely" her country will
join NATO, calling Russia's "brutal" war in Ukraine a "wake-up call to
us all."]{.underline}

[That eagerness could also put more pressure on Sweden]{.underline},
which would be left as the only Nordic country outside the alliance and
which would break its longstanding practice of neutrality by joining.

["The fact that these countries were not on track to join NATO three
months ago and now they are is definitely a response to Russian
aggression.]{.underline} Russia should realize its aggression against
Ukraine has spooked a lot of countries, even to the point that a country
like [Sweden, which has a 200-year history of nonalignment, is now
looking at actually joining NATO,"]{.underline} said Kurt Volker, a
former U.S. ambassador to NATO who also served as a special envoy on
Ukraine.

"Finlandization was coined as a word to describe the Soviet Union's
insistence that Finland not exercise its own choices on security. Now
they're going to do it anyway. So in that sense, these are definitely
responses to Russian aggression, and it's probably good for Russia to
realize that," he added.

NATO expansionists are hopeful the two countries will formally signal
their intention before NATO's June meeting in Madrid, where members
could sign an accession protocol that would also need to be individually
approved by each country's legislative body.

Experts say [they are likely to be welcomed into the
alliance.]{.underline}

["They have advanced, modern militaries and are seen as security
providers versus security]{.underline} consumers," Monaghan said.

[But beyond the practical defense implications, the move would also
**send a significant message**.]{.underline}

"This takes place within the context of what President Biden has called
the contest between autocracies and democracies. So certainly
[membership would project an image of Western solidarity, transatlantic
solidarity and]{.underline} I think [would be an **injection of
democratic values into NATO,**]{.underline} so that would be visible to
Russia as well," said Gene Germanovich, an international defense
researcher with the Rand Corporation.

Once newcomers are invited by NATO members, each of the 30 member
countries would have to go through their own process for [approving the
treaty]{.underline}, a task that can last years but one that experts are
hoping [with proper motivation could take as little as a few
months.]{.underline}

Volker said he was hopeful Sweden would complete its own internal
decision-making prior to the June summit.

"NATO summit leaders ... want to be able to make this decision once and
then they want to close any gray zone between going to be a member of
NATO but not yet a member of NATO and ultimately becoming a member of
NATO --- they want to close that gap as quickly as possible," he said.

### AT: Finland Won't Contribute

#### Finland already has connections with NATO and has a strong military to contribute -- joining alliance is the next step 

**Orpo, 22 -- chair of the National Coalition party in Finland**
\[Petteri, 14 March, Financial Times, Russia's invasion shows it is time
for the next chapter on Finland and Nato,
<https://www.ft.com/content/af01c46d-15ab-461f-b1b8-e150e581e99c>, Acc
6/18/22, HO\]

A lasting detente or a return to multilateral co-operation with the
current Russian government seem very unlikely right now. While Finland
is not facing direct military threats, it has become evident that we
need to re-evaluate our relations with the country next door[. While we
have advocated good neighbourly relations in the past, Russia's current
aggression and statements regarding our possible Nato membership show
how even the principles of good relations are subject to rapid
change.]{.underline}

[As Russia openly threatens peace in Europe, we need to look at all
available means to improve our own security as well as that of Europe as
a whole]{.underline}. There is a broad consensus in Finland that this
situation has changed permanently at the same time as our potential Nato
membership is on the table.

[Finland has been a reliable Nato partner since 1994 and we have a close
political-military relationship with the alliance.]{.underline} In
recent years, we have participated in Nato exercises concerning
collective security in Europe[. In practice, Finland has become
completely interoperable with Nato.]{.underline}

Now is the time for both Finland and Nato to look at the next steps. The
National Coalition party has supported our bid for Nato membership since
2006 and continues to do so. We believe that Finland's --- as well as
Sweden's [--- Nato membership would improve not just our own security
but the overall defence of Europe. We are in a valuable position due to
our military capabilities and geostrategic location between the High
North and the Baltic Sea.]{.underline}

[While other countries downsized their militaries and capabilities after
the cold war, Finland did the exact opposite. We have long prepared
ourselves for conventional military threats and we never dropped the
ball on national defence.]{.underline} Our wartime strength is 280,000
soldiers, alongside our state of the art defence capabilities. [And it
is worth remembering that our F-35 fighter acquisitions will take our
defence budget to more than 2 per cent of gross domestic
product.]{.underline}

[It is safe to conclude that we are already a valuable contributor to
the defence of Europe and will continue to be one]{.underline}. Even as
the pillars of European security are in flux around us, it is becoming
ever clearer that a common approach to upholding peace and stability in
the future is necessary[. The time for the next chapter for Finland and
Nato is now.]{.underline}

#### Finland is constantly improving its defense with new military equipment and has a large defense force

**Ossa 22 -- Researcher at the Finnish National Defence University**
\[[HELJÄ](https://warontherocks.com/author/helja-ossa/), MAY 9, 2022,
War on the Rocks, "WHAT WOULD FINLAND BRING TO THE TABLE FOR NATO?"
<https://warontherocks.com/2022/05/what-would-finland-bring-to-the-table-for-nato/>
Acc. 6/23/22 ER\]

[Finland has always assumed a pragmatic, hands-on approach to national
defense]{.underline}. When the Cold War ended, most European countries
shifted their focus to expeditionary operations, reduced their defense
spending, and developed smaller but highly professional and specialized
military forces. Finland chose a different path --- not least because of
its 800-mile border with Russia. [Helsinki maintained a strong national
defense posture, the cornerstones of which are conscription and a large,
well-trained reserve]{.underline}. The relatively cheap conscription
system and having a large reserve instead of a large active-duty force
allowed [Finland]{.underline} to [maintain a credible defense even when
the share of GDP spent on defense was lower]{.underline} than desirable.
In the late Cold War, Finland spent approximately 1.6 percent of its GDP
on defense, and in the early 1990s this figure saw a rapid increase to
1.9 percent are to the purchase of 64 F-18s from the United States in
1992. After that Finnish defense budgets kept declining and were at
their lowest in 2001 (1.1 percent of GDP). Since then, defense spending
began to rise until 2012, when the Finnish military began a three-year
period of reform that included defense budget cuts from 1.4 percent to
1.2 percent of GDP and the dissolution of several military bases,
resulting in significant gaps in readiness that need patching up.

Still, [while other countries sold their military equipment, Finland
purchased new systems and updated existing capabilities]{.underline}.
Along with the F-18s, other major purchases include AGM-158 Joint
Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles from the United States (2012), Multiple
Launch Rocket Systems and Leopard 2A6 main battle tanks from the
Netherlands (2014), K9 armored howitzers from South Korea (2017), and
most recently F-35 fighter jets from the United States (2021). [The navy
modernized]{.underline} its Hamina-class vessels a few years ago[, and
underwater warfare capabilities were improved with the integration of
the Variable Depth Sonar system and torpedoes]{.underline}. [Currently,
Finland is in the process of replacing several older vessels
with]{.underline} four [modern]{.underline} multi-role corvettes,
capable of effectively conducting a range of tasks at sea all year
round. Along with the defense of national territory and airspace,
maintaining a capable navy (in close cooperation with Sweden) is
particularly important for Finland, whose trade and security of supply
depend on the open sea lines of the Baltic Sea.

The Cornerstone

Finland has based its security on strong national defense and
international cooperation. [The Finnish Defence Forces have four main
tasks]{.underline}: the military defense of Finland, supporting other
national authorities, taking part in international activities, and
taking part in international military crisis management. [Out of these,
the most important task is naturally the defense of the
country]{.underline}. The cornerstone of a strong national defense
posture is capable, well-trained armed forces. The [military defense of
Finland is arranged through conscription]{.underline} --- an anomaly
that many European countries, including Sweden, abolished or deactivated
during the post-Cold War years. [Conscription and the reserve are
regarded as the only cost-efficient ways to maintain a credible national
defense in a country that is large in territory but small in
populatio]{.underline}n. According to the Finnish constitution, every
Finnish citizen is obligated to participate in national defense but only
men aged 18 to 60 are liable for military service. Women can apply on a
voluntary basis. Depending on the role that the conscripts are trained
for, their service lasts for six, nine, or 12 months, followed by
rehearsals during the years after service. [The]{.underline} Finnish
[military trains approximately 22,000 conscripts every
year]{.underline}, which is about two thirds of each age group. There is
a wide support for conscription among the Finnish public, alongside
pressure to modernize the system --- for example, many young Finns want
to see conscription made more gender-equal.

The number of active military personnel in the Finnish Defence Forces is
small: about 19,000 plus the roughly 3,000-strong paramilitary Border
Guard, which upon mobilization would be wholly or partly incorporated
into the Defence Force. [Due to the conscription system]{.underline},
however, [the reserve is large]{.underline}. The [fully mobilized field
army is sized at 280,000, with several hundred thousand more reservists
available]{.underline} to fill losses. Units can be roughly divided into
three main categories: the best-trained and equipped operational units,
regional forces, and local units (some of which train frequently and
maintain high readiness). [The air force and navy operate higher-tech
equipment]{.underline}, such as Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles,
Gabriel anti-ship missiles, and RIM-162 Sea Sparrow missiles, and are
traditionally more operationally ready. Still, all air force and navy
enablers (and, in the case of the navy, much of a ship's rotating
personnel) are conscripts or reservists.

As a comparison, Sweden, which has double the population of Finland, has
active personnel of approximately 24,000 soldiers and a reserve of
31,800. NATO ally Norway, which is the same size as Finland in terms of
population, trains approximately 10,000 conscripts a year and has 16,000
active personnel. As a response to the war in Ukraine and the
deteriorating security situation in Europe, the [Finnish Defence Forces
recently announced an increase in the number of reservists called to
rehearsals from 19,300 to 28,300 annually]{.underline}.

#### Finland is set to continue to increase its military spending

Acc. 6/23/22 ER\]

[Maintaining a strong and credible national defense]{.underline}, even
in a conscription-based system[, is costly. This year's Finnish defense
budget is set at 5.1 billion euros ---1.9 percent of GDP. Only two years
earlier, defense's share of GDP was 1.3 percent]{.underline}. This rapid
increase can be explained by the purchase of new F-35 fighter aircraft,
but [the war in Ukraine has prompted demands to further increase the
budget]{.underline}. The [military will get additional
funding]{.underline} of 700 million euros in 2022 and 788 million euros
[in 2023, bringing its budget up to 2.2 percent of GDP]{.underline}. The
readiness and capabilities of the Finnish military have been
strengthened in all operational domains. [Finland already has one of the
strongest artilleries in Europe]{.underline} (1500 systems). [The war in
Ukraine has showed that]{.underline} even in the 21st century, [properly
maintaining strong conventional forces remains the key factor in
credible deterrence for a non-nuclear state]{.underline}. Still,
governments need to find the budget to develop readiness and
capabilities in new operational domains too, including the cyber, space,
and information domains. Finland is no exception. International
cooperation is particularly important in responding to hybrid threats,
cyber operations, and information warfare.

A competitive defense industry is another important piece in the
national defense puzzle. [Finland's defense industry is highly
specialized, which is why the country procures a great deal of materiel
and equipment from abroad and is actively involved in procurement
cooperation with other Nordic and European partners]{.underline}. The
Finnish defense industry plays a crucial role in supplying and
maintaining the Finnish military, but about [40 to 60 percent of its
products are exported]{.underline}, including communication systems,
vehicle systems, vessels, and protective equipment[. In 2020 the export
volume was 43 percent]{.underline}. The defense industry consists
predominantly of small and medium-sized privately owned companies, with
total turnover within the defense, aerospace, and security sectors of
1.84 billion euros in 2020. With a few exceptions such as Patria,
producer of the Armored Modular Vehicle and NEMO mortar system, there
are no large industrial players

### AT: Finland & Sweden Can't be Integrated

#### Sweden and Finland can be integrated smoothly \-\-- they already participate in exercises

**Wormuth, 22 \-\-- Secretary of the Army, US Department of Defense**
(June 2, 2022, Christine Wormuth, moderated by Vivian Salama who serves
as a national security reporter at The Wall Street Journal "NATO allies
must not take their unity on Ukraine for granted, says Secretary of the
Army Christine Wormuth,"
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/news/transcripts/nato-allies-must-not-take-their-unity-on-ukraine-for-granted-says-secretary-of-the-army-christine-wormuth/>,
JMP)

VIVIAN SALAMA: There's a number of Ukraine questions that we're getting
here today. Can you speak to the impact---this is from Michael Hauser,
by the way---can you speak to the impact of Putin's war in
Ukraine---that Putin's war in Ukraine has had on strengthening the
relationship between NATO and US Army leadership in Europe? And what is
necessary to maintain the strength of that relationship in the decades
to come?

CHRISTINE WORMUTH: Sure. Well, [we have very strong relationships
with]{.underline}, you know, NATO country---with the [armies of NATO
countries]{.underline}. General McConville does, you know, counterpart
meetings every year. There is an entire land conference for European
allies---or European armies, excuse me. So we will try to keep those
relationships very, very strong.

I think another thing I would highlight is through the Army National
Guard state partnership program, [we actually have very deep
relationships with not just Ukraine, but]{.underline} again, [all of the
NATO countries]{.underline}. And one of the real values of that
particular program is that the general officers in the National Guard,
you know, their tenures can be quite a bit longer. Their personnel are
not rotating as much as they do in the active component. And that allows
them to sometimes have relationships with NATO countries that last for
years, you know, not just a couple of years. So you're able to have, I
think, a much deeper kind of set of connections through that program.

VIVIAN SALAMA: I mean, that question sort of raises one in my mind about
also the potential new members that are joining NATO and how [the US
military is working with Sweden and Finland to potentially get them up
to speed and get them **integrated into the alliance
smoothly**]{.underline}, especially with things so tense in their
backyards.

CHRISTINE WORMUTH: You know, I think it's been a little while since I've
been deep in kind of NATO activities, but my recollection is that [even
though Sweden and Finland were not actually NATO members, they were very
close to NATO]{.underline}. And, you know, [when it came to
participating in exercises]{.underline}, for example, you know, [the
Swedes and the Finns participated pretty deeply]{.underline}. So I think
it will not be---you know, [there's not a big gap there to
bridge]{.underline}. I think, you know, [they will **come into NATO
pretty quickly** and assimilate and be]{.underline}, you know, [right up
there with all of their soon-to-be counterpart countries]{.underline}.

### U.S.-Turkey Relations Solves Conflicts

#### Strong ties with Turkey are critical to peace in Europe -- checks Russian influence and stabilizes Ukraine, Syria, Libya and the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan 

**Hess, 22 -- Central Asia fellow at the Foreign Policy Research
Institute** (June 22, 22; Maximillian Hess, "Why the West should make
peace with Erdogan now,"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/22/turkey-erdogan-ukraine-russia-war-west-us-geopolitics-black-sea-europe-energy/>,
AI)

[The democratic West has a long and controversial history of entering
alliances of convenience with dictators and strongmen around the
world---unsavory but necessary partners in confronting threats to the
international order.]{.underline} Denounced as ethically dubious, [this
sort of stance is also realist, balance-of-power politics par
excellence]{.underline}. It enabled the world to unite to defeat Adolf
Hitler in World War II and the West to win the Cold War.

[Atop the list of unsavory partners the West urgently needs better
relations with today sits]{.underline} Turkish President Recep Tayyip
[Erdogan.]{.underline} That he is unsavory is clear: He has actively
undermined Turkish democracy, undone decades of liberalization,
weaponized migration, terrorized the Kurdish minority both at home and
in neighboring Syria, and helped Iran violate U.S. sanctions. Most
recently, he has threatened to block NATO membership for Sweden and
Finland. It will take a long time before the West can genuinely trust
him.

However, [the reality is that the West needs Erdogan more than ever.
Russia's brutal, all-out war against Ukraine has vastly raised Turkey's
profile on the geostrategic chessboard. Ankara has emerged as a key
supplier of drones to Kyiv---shipments it has luckily shown no intention
of halting. Ukraine's chances of victory would be significantly improved
if Turkish arms deliveries were expanded. Erdogan, who controls access
to the Black Sea through the Turkish Straits, crucially shut the passage
to warships in late February.]{.underline}

At the same time, [Ankara has also been willing to cooperate with Moscow
on Ukraine where Erdogan sees an opportunity.]{.underline} Turkish
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu discussed plans to secure a route for
Ukrainian grain exports with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in
Ankara on June 8, reportedly asking for a 25 percent discount on Turkish
grain purchases as part of the deal. [Without Ankara on board, any
Western proposals to break the Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports are
**dead on arrival**.]{.underline}

[The West also needs Turkey on its side in the **economic war against
Russia**. Ankara's support alone can restrict the flow of sanctioned
Russian goods in and out of the Black Sea]{.underline}, which continue
even as Ukrainian ships are stuck in port. [Ankara's help is crucial in
cutting ratlines for Russian money and kleptocrats. Turkey has become a
major destination for Russian money]{.underline} (and oligarchs' yachts)
[fleeing sanctions and plays a growing role in supporting Russian
President Vladimir Putin's new autarkic economy.]{.underline} Turkey is
one of the few major countries that freely accept Russian payment,
undercutting the impact of Western banking sanctions. [Bringing Turkey
onboard would plug one of the largest holes in the sanctions
regime.]{.underline}

But most importantly, [**Turkey will be a key player** in the reordering
of European energy supplies, not least because it controls energy access
through a number of crucial pipelines.]{.underline} The key to Europe's
Southern Gas Corridor strategy, for example, is gas from Azerbaijan
supplied via Turkey's Trans-Anatolian and Trans-Adriatic
pipelines---inaugurated in 2018 and 2020, respectively---and feeding
into the European gas grid in the Balkans and Italy.

[Erdogan is also actively seeking to develop Turkey's own gas resources
and potentially even link Israeli and Cypriot offshore gas fields to the
European pipeline network]{.underline}. Such efforts are of course
complicated by Greco-Turkish disputes over Cyprus and its surrounding
waters[. A revived European-Turkish partnership may be the only way the
Eastern Mediterranean's rich energy resources can be fully
utilized.]{.underline} Such a partnership might also nudge Erdogan to
make an about-face vis-à-vis Russia, where the inauguration of the
TurkStream pipeline in 2020 signaled a new high point in Turkish-Russian
relations.

Finally, [aligning with Erdogan would offer the West more **geostrategic
leverage over the Kremlin** beyond the war in Ukraine. **Turkey is also
a key player in three additional conflicts** where Russia is involved:
Syria, Libya, and the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh.]{.underline} Erdogan moved from a policy of benign
neglect to active intervention in these conflicts over the past decade,
motivated by a desire to boost Turkey's role as a regional power
independent of the West. [A resumed partnership with Erdogan offers
further pressure points in the effort to **constrain Moscow's global
influence**.]{.underline}

### Turkey Key to NATO

#### Turkey important to NATO -- has significant military capacity to assist the alliance

**Coşkun, 22** -- senior fellow at CEIP and former director general for
int-security affairs at the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (June
24, 22; Alper Coşkun; "Turkey and NATO are stronger with each other.
They must de-thorne their relationship";
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/turkeysource/turkey-and-nato-are-stronger-with-each-other-they-must-de-thorn-their-relationship/>,
AI)

With seventy years under its belt, [Turkey is among NATO's older
members. It boasts a strong legacy, having been a bulwark against
communism during the Cold War and a frontline player in many regional
crises that erupted later, including in the South Caucasus, Balkans,
Iraq, and, most recently, Syria]{.underline}. In contrast to most other
Alliance members, this incessant state of conflict around its borders
has denied Turkey any peace dividend.

[Turkey's formidable military capacity and growing expeditionary
capabilities, together with its expanding defense industry (particularly
in drone technologies) are all critical enablers for NATO.]{.underline}
Even as priorities change and global attention shifts to the east,
[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has proven that building sustainable
security in the Euro-Atlantic area is unfinished business. Much to the
delight of Turkish officials, this has corroborated Ankara's continuing
geopolitical relevance---something it is betting on]{.underline}, maybe
excessively so, [in making its demands of Finland and
Sweden.]{.underline}

But Turkey [has also benefitted immensely from its membership in
NATO]{.underline}, a reality that is often lost on (or conveniently
disregarded) by ideologically driven Turkish critics of the Alliance.
[The country's influence as a regional actor]{.underline}, both during
and after the Cold War, [has always been augmented by its NATO
identity]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [being embedded in the Alliance's
security network has made Turkey safer by **bolstering its deterrence
and defense**, thereby contributing to its sense of
security]{.underline}.

The strategic value of being a member of the world's strongest military
alliance cannot be overstated, and anyone who has doubts need not look
any further than Ukraine. Finland and Sweden get it, which is why they
have taken the historic decision of trashing age-old policies of
non-alignment in favor of becoming NATO members.

### No NATO Unity / Cohesion

#### Cohesion fraying now \-\-- Turkey and Hungary blocking NATO priorities

**Bloomberg Editors 22** \[June 20, 2022, "Western Unity Is More
Essential Than Ever",

Russian President Vladimir [Putin's attack on Ukraine has
made]{.underline} the West --- in this context, [NATO and
the]{.underline} **[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion ---
[more united than it's been in a long time]{.underline}. [Unfortunately,
**that cohesion is now at risk**]{.underline}, as the Russian invasion
turns into a grinding war of attrition. [To deter Putin from escalating
and to keep him from winning, Western leaders must focus on the two
weakest links in their alliance: Turkey and Hungary]{.underline}.

Recep Tayyip [Erdogan]{.underline}, the president of Turkey --- a member
of NATO but not the EU --- says [he will block the accession of Sweden
and Finland to the]{.underline} transatlantic [alliance unless he's
given a series of unrelated concessions]{.underline}. If he actually
follows through, [he would]{.underline} not only leave both countries
more vulnerable to Russian aggression, but also [render NATO weaker than
it should be in defending its Baltic members]{.underline}.
[Gratuitously, Erdogan is also **increasing tensions with Greece**,
another NATO ally.]{.underline}

Then there's [Hungarian Prime Minister]{.underline} Viktor
[Orban]{.underline}. For weeks, he's [been holding up a sanctions
package that would embargo Russian oil]{.underline}. EU leaders last
week thought they had finally reached a compromise: Only Russian oil
delivered by ship would be banned, whereas the sort arriving via
pipelines would not. That would give landlocked Hungary, as well as the
Czech Republic and Slovakia, more time to adjust their energy
infrastructure.

In a shocking breach of decorum, [Orban]{.underline} then reneged on
even that compromise. Bizarrely, he also [insisted on keeping the
Russian Orthodox Church's Patriarch Kirill --- a staunch backer of Putin
and the war --- off the new sanctions list]{.underline}. The EU gave in
to this demand, too, to get the package passed.

The whole ordeal was an embarrassment, and a rare cause for Putin to be
optimistic. [**In every way he can**, Orban is signaling that he's not
fully behind the West's joint effort to support Ukraine and undermine
Russia]{.underline} --- in effect, that he's not a reliable ally.

So what can be done? A basic design flaw shared by both the EU and NATO
is that neither has a mechanism to eject errant members. That means both
will need to get creative in reining in rogue leaders.

In Erdogan's case, acceding to blackmail shouldn't be an option. The US
should announce that future arms sales to Turkey will be halted until it
comes around on the new accessions. NATO should threaten to suspend
Turkish involvement in military planning and exercises. If the situation
escalates, revisiting the alliance's rules to allow for expulsions
should be on the table.

As for Orban, the EU will need to adopt a similarly hard line. In 2018,
the bloc triggered its treaty's Article 7 against Hungary in a censure
of its subversion of democratic institutions, launching a process that
could in theory strip Budapest of its voting rights in Brussels. In
practice, the measure has been toothless, because it requires unanimous
support. Poland, whose populist government is also the target of an
Article 7 proceeding, always had Hungary's back.

These days, however, Poland is among the member states that are most
hawkishly anti-Putin. And Warsaw is horrified by Orban's obstructionism.
Belatedly, the Poles have come to understand that a strong EU is in
their national interest, not against it. They should therefore persuade
Orban to join the effort to weaken Putin's war machine and strengthen
Ukraine. If he doesn't, the other 26 EU countries --- including Poland
--- should strip Hungary of its votes.

[Holding together the Western alliance has never been easy.]{.underline}
Amid a worsening war on its doorstep, it has rarely seemed more
necessary. [The time for **populist political games** is
over.]{.underline}

#### NATO still facing several obstacles that undermine cohesion \-\-- disagreements over strategic concept and political and military weaknesses

**Lucas, 22 \-\-- nonresident fellow at the Center for European Policy
Analysis** (JUNE 7, 2022, 5:31 AM, Edward, "NATO Is Out of Shape and Out
of Date; With the bloc's unity over Ukraine showing cracks, NATO needs
an overhaul,"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/07/nato-ukraine-russia-war-alliance-reform-geopolitics-military/>,
JMP)

Yet [look a little more closely, and the picture is far less
rosy]{.underline}. [Notwithstanding its apparent unity of purpose since
the start of Russia's war, NATO looks out of shape and out of
date.]{.underline} In the run-up to their summit, [the allies have been
**furiously haggling** over the language in their new strategic concept,
which will frame the alliance's mission for the coming years and will be
unveiled in Madrid]{.underline}. What will it say about Russia? About
China? What sacrifices and risks are the member states really willing to
accept? Are they willing to pool sovereignty in order to streamline
decision-making?

[**Nothing** in recent weeks suggests that these questions will get
clear answers.]{.underline} For starters, [the 30-strong alliance is
unwieldy]{.underline}. [In military terms, **only a handful of members
matter**]{.underline}---above all, the United States---[but in political
terms, even little Luxembourg and Iceland get a voice]{.underline}.
Worse, **[the political divides are huge]{.underline}**. Turkey under
President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan is a semi-authoritarian state that
**flirts with Russia** and fumes at]{.underline} what [it considers
European meddling over human rights]{.underline}. [Hungary]{.underline}
under Prime Minister Viktor Orban [is]{.underline} taking a different
but downward path, fusing wealth and power into a new system of control
at home and [undermining U.S. and European attempts to put pressure on
Russia and China]{.underline}. [Macron's relentless posturing and German
Chancellor]{.underline} Olaf Scholz's [foot-dragging create **constant
obstacles and distractions**]{.underline}. The two leader's weaknesses,
on glorious display since the start of the war, have already enriched
the language: Scholzen is a German neologism for "dither," while
makronic in Polish (and its equivalent in Ukrainian) can be roughly
translated as "vacuous grandstanding while doing nothing."

[Macron and Scholz corrode decision-making with their foibles and thus
place a **big question mark over the alliance's credibility and
cohesion**.]{.underline} [Any threat or provocation from Russia is
unlikely to be clear or conveniently timed.]{.underline} More likely it
will be something deliberately ambiguous, such as a Russian drone that
"accidentally" strays onto the territory of a front-line state and hits
a target. [Some countries would favor a tough response. Others would
fear escalation and want dialogue.]{.underline} Still others would take
the ambiguity as a convenient excuse to do nothing. Would the 30---soon
to be 32---national representatives in the North Atlantic Council, the
alliance's deliberative body, really make a speedy and tough decision on
how to react? More likely, some of them would plead for delay,
diplomacy, and compromise. Those actually facing the possibility of
attack would be far more hawkish, preferring a sharp military
confrontation to even the smallest Russian victory. "Not one inch, not
one soul," a senior military figure from one of the Baltic states,
speaking anonymously, told me. "We have seen what they did in Ukraine."

[The **political weaknesses** are matched by military ones]{.underline}.
By far the most important country in the alliance is the United States.
The U.S. security guarantee to Europe---with its threat of devastating
conventional and, if necessary, nuclear response to any attack---is the
cornerstone of the alliance. "All for one and one for all" sounds fine,
but nobody in the Kremlin will tremble at the thought of Spanish, Dutch,
or Canadian displeasure. Yet the result of this is a colossal dependence
on U.S. capabilities, ranging from ammunition and spare parts (of which
European countries' stockpiles are notoriously skinny) to military
transports that move forces quickly and efficiently over long distances.
[**Even if** Europe's new defense spending plans materialize, they will
not change the fact that only U.S. armed forces can move with the scale
and speed necessary to defend territory from a country like
Russia.]{.underline}

[Conversely, the countries that most need defending---Estonia, Latvia,
and Lithuania---are the least able to bear the burden
themselves.]{.underline} They need advanced weapons, particularly for
air and missile defense, that they cannot afford themselves. The thin
neck of land along the Polish-Lithuanian border, the so-called Suwalki
Gap, is particularly vulnerable to attack from Russia's militarized
Kaliningrad exclave and Belarus, from which Russia attacked Ukraine.
Poland and Lithuania both want a big U.S. military presence---either a
permanent base or a persistent rotation of forces---to safeguard this
strategic chokepoint.

Yet [NATO command structures and planning do not fully reflect the
imbalance of forces between the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and Europe]{.underline}. They rely on the
fiction that the European allies are more or less equal partners. [Even
military lightweights need to have important-sounding jobs and
installations, making the North Atlantic Council the military version of
a parliament dividing out the pork.]{.underline}

[The resulting command structure is like **a tangled pile of
spaghetti**.]{.underline} In the Baltic region alone, NATO has several
multinational headquarters, one divisional headquarterss split between
Latvia and Denmark, another divisional headquarters in Poland, and a
corps headquarters at a different location in Poland. Overall
responsibility for the defense of Europe is divided between three Joint
Forces Command headquarters in Naples, Italy; Brunssum, the Netherlands;
and Norfolk, Virginia. But the top U.S. military commander in Europe,
Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, is based at Supreme Headquarters Allied
Powers Europe in Mons, Belgium. A maritime strategy for the Baltic Sea
region has yet to be decided---which is just as well, because NATO has
yet to create a naval headquarters for the region. Nor has the alliance
drawn up real military plans for the reinforcement and defense of its
northeastern members, let alone decided who would actually provide the
forces and equipment in order to make them credible. Military mobility
is meant to be the responsibility of Joint Support and Enabling Command,
headquartered in Ulm, Germany, and originally set up as part of the
European Union's own defense policy.

[A further problem is exercises: NATO does not conduct fully realistic,
large-scale rehearsals of how it would respond to a Russian
attack.]{.underline} One problem is that these are costly and
disruptive. Another is that they expose the huge weaknesses of some NATO
members, which can cope with a carefully scripted exercise but lack the
ability to improvise. A third reason is the fear, in some countries,
that practicing war-fighting would be provocative. Also lacking are
detailed plans for fighting a war against Russia, covering such issues
as reinforcing of front-line states, countering a Russian attack,
regaining any temporarily occupied territory, and---most of
all---dealing with a nuclear or other escalation. As a result, [nobody
is quite sure how anything would work in a crisis]{.underline}. Instead,
another assumption reigns: that in a crisis, the United States would
take over and do the heavy lifting on all fronts---logistics,
intelligence, and combat.

To be fair, [NATO is working on these problems]{.underline}, and all of
them are fixable. [But that does not mean that they are anywhere near
being fixed. **Wishful thinking** remains the alliance's besetting
sin.]{.underline}

#### NATO not united on Ukraine

[Moscow's aggression]{.underline} also [has triggered a]{.underline}
sense of alarm and a [more serious attitude in multiple European
countries about doing more for NATOs collective defense]{.underline}
mission. That shift has been especially evident in Germany, where
Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government approved an emergency fund to boost
Berlin's military budget by 100 billion Euros. The latter move would
finally fulfill Germany's longstanding pledge (along with all other NATO
members) to spend at least 2 percent of Gross Domestic Product annually
on defense. Berlin had repeatedly procrastinated about carrying out that
commitment. A far more militant posture by the Scholz government also
was apparent when it stated an intent to ship weapons to Ukraine to
bolster that country's military resistance. Previous German governments
would have considered such involvement in a raging war unthinkable.
Numerous other NATO members, including the United States, already are
pouring weapons into Ukraine.

Nevertheless, [it is easy to **overstate the degree of unity** regarding
policy toward Russia even among NATO members]{.underline}, much less
within the broader international community. Indeed, [some **cracks
already are beginning to form**]{.underline} in NATO's solid front.
[When Poland's Vice Premier]{.underline}, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, [suggested
that the Alliance send an armed peacekeeping force to Ukraine to provide
humanitarian aid, the reactions were widely divergent]{.underline}.
Estonian Defense Minister Kalle Laanet said that a proposed peacekeeping
mission was "one of the possibilities" NATO should consider, but
[several]{.underline} other [governments pushed back]{.underline}. We're
"still in too early stages to talk about that," said Dutch Defense
Minister Kajsa Ollongren, adding that such a deployment would need the
backing of the United Nations Security Council---a requirement that made
the plan a nonstarter, since as a permanent member of the Council,
Russia holds veto power.

[**Divisions within NATO** are even **increasingly evident** on the
issue of providing weapons to Ukraine]{.underline}. Addressing a massive
campaign rally on March 15, [Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban,
emphasized that "we must stay out of this war ... therefore we will not
send any troops or weapons]{.underline} to the battlegrounds." A few
days later, Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov stated flatly that his
country will not engage in "hostilities" in Ukraine and that no arms
will be supplied.

#### While US may support aid to Ukraine, there lack of unity and cohesion globally on strategy

**Carpenter 22 -- senior fellow for defense and foreign policy studies
at the Cato Institute** \[Ted Galen, MARCH 23, 2022, CATO institute,
"Just How United Is NATO (and the World) against Russia?"

ER\]

Beyond NATO (and longstanding U.S. allies in East Asia), [the absence of
support for Washington's strategy of imposing harsh penalties on Russia
is glaringly evident]{.underline}. That problem surfaced almost
immediately. On March 2, [the U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations
[General Assembly approved a resolution condemning Russia's invasion of
Ukraine and calling for the immediate withdrawal of Russian military
forces]{.underline}. 141 [countries voted]{.underline} for the
resolution, and [U.S. officials gloated that only 5 voted against
it.]{.underline}

[However]{.underline}, a stunning [35 countries decided to
abstain]{.underline}, [even though a favorable vote to placate the
United States and its allies should have been an easy option, since the
resolution was purely symbolic, not obligating UN members to take
any]{.underline} substantive [action]{.underline}. [Yet a significant
number of countries]{.underline} in Asia, the Greater Middle East, and
Sub‐​Saharan Africa, [opted to snub Washington]{.underline}. When more
than 20 percent of the General Assembly's membership refuses to embrace
a purely feel‐​good measure Washington wants passed, the U.S.-sponsored
global coalition looks fragile indeed.

[It is especially ominous for U.S]{.underline}. objectives
[that]{.underline} both [China and India]{.underline} have remained
[firm in their opposition to imposing economic sanctions on
Russia]{.underline}---as have numerous other countries outside of Europe
and East Asia. Even portions of Latin America have balked at waging an
economic war against Russia. Indeed, beyond Washington's network of
traditional allies, the isolation of Russia appears to be significantly
exaggerated.

Political scientists frequently note that [coalitions tend to be a
**mile wide but only an inch deep**]{.underline}. [That]{.underline}
situation [may well apply to NATO unity regarding policy toward
Russia]{.underline}. When it comes to the rest of the world, any sense
of unity on that issue is not even a half‐​inch deep.

### AT: Consultation Link 

#### Consultations have not been effective in strengthening NATO -- there is no enforcement or obligation

**Lorenz, 20** **\-\-- international security expert at the Polish
Institute of International Affairs** \[Wojciech, November, 2020,
"Strengthening NATO's cohesion through consultation",
<https://icds.ee/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ICDS_Brief_NATO2030_-Series_1_Wojciech_Lorenz_November-2020_cor.pdf>,
accessed 6/23/22, NB\]

The strongest norms and most elaborate mechanisms have been developed
regarding consultations on collective defence policy. Since this is a
primary task of NATO, derived directly from the Washington Treaty, some
experts claim that there might be a legal obligation to consult before a
NATO member takes a definite action, which could undermine the common
defence.4 [There is no mechanism to enforce compliance and there are
**numerous examples** of Allies bypassing consultation to take
unilateral actions.]{.underline} Nevertheless, most Allies try to
respect such a norm as it creates a similar obligation for the US,
limiting the risk, for example, of the unexpected or uncoordinated
withdrawal of US troops from Europe.

There is another important dimension of consultations concerning actions
[outside]{.underline} the [Euro-Atlantic area]{.underline}---since this
is not a 'treaty area' [there is no]{.underline} apparent [legal
obligation to consult.]{.underline} Nevertheless, the European Allies
expected the US to use consultations to inform them about plans that
could affect NATO's security. [The US was also interested in such
consultation]{.underline}s, [expecting]{.underline} that they would
facilitate coordination of NATO policies in [support]{.underline} [of
American foreign policy goals, but this rarely turned out to be the
case]{.underline}. The 1967 Harmel report was an attempt to strengthen
this dimension of consultation and thus NATO's political cohesion,
stating that "the North Atlantic

Treaty Area cannot be treated in isolation from the rest of the world.
Crises and conflicts arising outside the area may impair its security
either directly or by affecting the global balance."5

In 1974, [NATO made]{.underline} another [attempt to strengthen
consultations adopting the Ottawa Declaration]{.underline}, which
stressed that "the Allies are firmly resolved to keep each other fully
informed and to strengthen the practice of frank and timely
consultations by all means which may be appropriate on matters relating
to their common interests as members of the Alliance, bearing in mind
that these interests can be affected by events in other areas of the
world."6

Such [declarations, however, did not solve]{.underline} the structural
problems that discouraged states from consulting to coordinate common
responses to crises outside the treaty area. [Some states blocked such
consultations]{.underline}, believing that the Alliance should not deal
with problems beyond its 'treaty area' and that discussions could lead
to new commitments that would undermine collective defence and
deterrence policy. Bigger states also wanted to preserve their
privileged bilateral relations with the US, which often resulted in
informal consultations in smaller formats. The US did not want to share
sensitive information with all Allies without guarantees that this would
result in coordinated action in support of US foreign policy goals.

#### NATO consultations have not diffused tensions

**Lorenz, 20 \-\-- international security expert at the Polish Institute
of International Affairs** \[Wojciech, November, 2020, "Strengthening

[In recent years]{.underline}, [NATO's]{.underline} mechanisms of
[consultation have **proved lacking** in defusing tensions and
discouraging unilateral actions]{.underline}, both [in the Euro-Atlantic
area and beyond]{.underline} it.

During Donald Trump's presidency, [for example, the US withdrew troops
from Syria]{.underline}, despite the possible impact on the security of
the Allies. [This unilateral decision encouraged Turkey to send troops
to Syria, which could further complicate the fight with Islamic
terrorist groups and increase the risk of confrontation between Turkey
and Russia]{.underline}, which has a military presence in Syria. Also,
despite NATO's presence in Afghanistan, the US pursued negotiations with
the Taliban without providing [NATO]{.underline} with an insight into
its plans. And it only [resorted to consultations in NATO on its
decision to withdraw]{.underline} from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces treaty after the criticism from the Allies. Similarly, it first
announced the decision to withdraw troops from Germany and only later
consulted with Allies about how to limit the impact on NATO. [Some of
these decisions were publicly criticised by NATO members]{.underline},
most vocally by French president Emmanuel Macron who, before the 2019
NATO leaders meeting, accused the Alliance of being "brain dead" and
took the opportunity to promote the idea of European 'strategic
autonomy'.9

### Unity Not Key 

#### Unity is not key to helping member states\-\-- disagreements are inevitable and a [built-in benefit]{.underline} 

**Skaluba & Rodhian, 22** \-\-- \*served as principal director for
European and NATO policy in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, AND
\*\*associate director in the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and
Security's Transatlantic Security Initiative (January 18, 2022,

Initiative in the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and

JMP)

[As the crisis over Ukraine intensifies, key stakeholders are looking to
Brussels for signs of Western resolve.]{.underline} At the NATO-Russia
Council meeting on January 12, the Alliance delivered: In a vivid
expression of solidarity, it categorically (and unanimously) rejected
Russian demands to forgo future expansion or withdraw forces from member
countries.

Yet [as the crisis evolves, decisions about how to support Ukraine will
become more difficult]{.underline}, and [there's a **limit to how
unified NATO can be**]{.underline}. While the West might agree on
introducing tough new economic sanctions and reinforcing the Alliance's
eastern flank, [boosting Kyiv's military capacity]{.underline}---by
supporting an insurgency, for instance, or sending anti-tank
weapons---[will be impossible to achieve by consensus and is much more
likely to come from **individual members than under NATO
auspices**]{.underline}.

This shouldn't be surprising. Consider Russia's annexation of Crimea in
2014 and its ongoing support for separatists in Ukraine's Donbas region:
[NATO actions in support of Kyiv have been more political than
operational, leaving it to individual allies to provide munitions,
equipment, and training to Ukrainian forces]{.underline}. And despite a
recurrent pledge that Ukraine would one day be welcome to join the
Alliance, as well as the sympathy expressed by allies for Ukraine's
plight, there's been precious little progress on this front.

NATO is primarily concerned about defending its members from Russian
aggression---which it is also wary of provoking by supporting the
Ukrainian military.

Yet despite its lack of meaningful military support for Ukraine, the
crisis has been the animating issue on the Alliance's agenda since 2014.
Russia's attacks on Ukraine and its support for separatists have driven
major NATO initiatives on readiness, defense planning, force posture,
intelligence, and technology development, with an eye toward beefing up
the Alliance's northern and eastern flanks and deterring Russia in both
the conventional and sub-threshold realms. As an institution established
to safeguard Europe, it has successfully geared itself to deter the type
of destabilizing Russian belligerence currently on display.

[Critics of the alliance]{.underline} (and even some supporters) [have
interpreted NATO's unwillingness to militarily support
Ukraine]{.underline}---especially during the most significant challenge
to the European security order since the Cold War---[as an indicator of
its declining relevance, timidity, or its divisions. But that
**overstates the importance of political consensus** to NATO's value and
understates its role as an effective and flexible defensive
alliance.]{.underline} This is a role with potentially critical benefits
for Ukraine.

First, [it **sets too high a bar** for an alliance of thirty members
with aligned, but distinct, priorities.]{.underline} **[Unanimity on
every issue is impossible]{.underline}**, let alone one as complex as
military support to Ukraine. [Debate and disagreement]{.underline}, as
it should be for any democratic institution, [are **built-in features of
NATO---not bugs**]{.underline}. In reality, [it's astounding how often
NATO does reach consensus about issues big and small, creating an
**unrealistic expectation** that it always will]{.underline}. **[The
opposite of consensus is not failure.]{.underline}** Suggesting
otherwise turns any debate that doesn't end harmoniously into an
indictment of NATO, playing straight into Russian propaganda.

Second, a belief that [NATO's]{.underline} value is tied primarily to
achieving consensus on every issue misses the more mundane (and
important) ways it supports its allies and partners. Its [affinity for
process]{.underline}---particularly [its ability to build a common
situational understanding]{.underline} among its
members---[is]{.underline} an [invaluable]{.underline} tool. Habits of
consultation and information sharing, buttressed by deep cooperation on
operations, intelligence sharing, defense planning, and
interoperability, create the foundation upon which any consensus is to
be built. [Even in the absence of]{.underline} that [agreement, the
ability to collectively define threats and jointly train to confront
them is immensely valuable in its own right]{.underline}.

Third, [these habits of cooperation give NATO members the flexibility to
act **outside of the Alliance's frameworks**]{.underline}. While NATO
does much by consensus---such as its missions in the Baltic states---the
skills it helps members develop is central to enabling them to form
separate coalitions for action. This happened recently with ample
success in taking on the Islamic State. Such flexibility should be a
point in NATO's favor, not evidence of its ineptitude.

[In the case of military support for Ukraine, policymakers will find
more attractive alternatives for dealing with Moscow's aggression
outside of the auspices of the Alliance.]{.underline} Up to and
including its recent dialogue with Russia, it has taken a host of
consensus actions to support Ukraine---from condemning Kremlin
aggression and standing up for Kyiv politically to reaffirming its
open-door policy with an expectation that Ukraine will eventually become
a member. It might even share intelligence and develop training and
advisory programs for the Ukrainian military.

And [while it won't find a consensus to fight, it could provide the
foundation for certain allies to support Ukrainian forces in ways
consistent with their national priorities **outside of
NATO**]{.underline}. In that case, NATO's enabling value to its members
in complicating Putin's cost-benefit assessment should be applauded.

Last week's NATO-Russia Council meeting showcased an Alliance working in
lockstep and finding political consensus in responding to preposterous
Russian demands. [NATO should always strive for]{.underline} this degree
of [consensus]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} if and [when]{.underline}
this crisis intensifies, and [Putin advances further]{.underline} into
Ukraine, expectations for NATO assistance will be raised, decisions
about how to respond will become more difficult, and [consensus will be
more elusive]{.underline}.

Despite the rhetoric we might hear in response, **[this is not evidence
of NATO's ineffectiveness]{.underline}**---[but]{.underline} rather a
[reflection of how democratic institutions function]{.underline}. And
[**even absent consensus, NATO can still contribute invaluably** to
Ukraine's sovereignty]{.underline}.

### NATO Can't Solve Russia

#### NATO unprepared for Russia's modern warfare

- Weaponizing of hunger

- Campaign of disinformation

**Lucas, 22 \-\-- nonresident fellow at the Center for European Policy
Analysis** (JUNE 7, 2022, 5:31 AM, Edward, "NATO Is Out of Shape and Out
of Date; With the bloc's unity over Ukraine showing cracks, NATO needs
an overhaul,"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/07/nato-ukraine-russia-war-alliance-reform-geopolitics-military/>,
JMP)

Worse, [NATO is unprepared for the changing nature of modern
warfare]{.underline}. [Russia's]{.underline} old-style assault on
Ukraine is all too familiar. But the artillery bombardments and missile
strikes that are grinding down Ukraine's defenses are only part of the
Kremlin's arsenal. Its [most effective weapons are nonmilitary:
subversion, diplomatic divide-and-rule tactics, economic coercion,
corruption, and propaganda.]{.underline} The most burning current
example of nonmilitary warfare is [Russia's weaponizing of
hunger]{.underline}. By blocking Ukraine's grain exports, Russia has
raised the specter of famine over millions of people, including in
volatile and fragile countries in North Africa and the Middle East. Mass
starvation is not just a humanitarian catastrophe, but its consequences
include political unrest and mass migration, a direct threat to Europe.
Yet [**NATO is ill-equipped** to deal with this]{.underline}. It cannot
mandate more economical use of grain---for example, by feeding less to
livestock and stopping grain's conversion to fuel. It has no food
stockpiles to release to a hungry world. It cannot build new railways to
ship Ukrainian grain through other routes. Nor can it insure merchant
vessels that might---for a price---be willing to run Russia's Black Sea
blockade. [NATO has little in-house expertise in countering Russian
disinformation and almost zero influence in African and other countries
susceptible to Kremlin narratives blaming the West for the food
shortages that are already starting now.]{.underline}

NATO could acquire these capabilities. Or it could regain them: During
the Cold War, the alliance had an economic warfare division and ran a
program called the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export
Controls to prevent the Soviet bloc from acquiring sensitive
technologies. But in the strategic timeout that followed the collapse of
the Soviet bloc, these agencies and their skill sets shriveled and died.

But as with NATO's military shortcomings, identifying the problems is
not the same as solving them. And [given the bloc's **unwieldy
structure** and issues with key members, it might be **wise to lower
expectations** about NATO returning to Cold War levels of consistent
readiness and effectiveness]{.underline}. A more realistic vision for
the alliance would be to treat it as a framework for the most capable
and threat-aware members to form coalitions of the willing. These
groupings already exist: The British-led Joint Expeditionary Force, for
example, is a 10-country framework for military cooperation, chiefly
aimed at enabling very rapid deployments to the Nordic-Baltic region in
the event of a crisis. France has a similar venture, the European
Intervention Initiative. The five Nordic states have their own military
club, called the Nordic Defence Cooperation, while Poland has close
bilateral ties with Lithuania. A similar network of bilateral and
multilateral ties would greatly strengthen the alliance's floundering
presence in the Black Sea and other regions, including North Africa and
the Eastern Mediterranean. These groupings would not supplant NATO but
improve action and interoperability on top of the alliance's established
structures and mechanisms.

The difficult and underlying question here is the role of the United
States. Europe is, in theory, big and rich enough to manage its own
defense. But its persistent political weakness prevents that. [The
paradox is that only U.S. involvement makes NATO credible---yet
overdependence on the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [also undermines the alliance's credibility,
while stoking resentment in France and elsewhere. The task for
Washington is to encourage European allies to shoulder more of the
burden and start thinking strategically again, even as it retains the
superpower involvement that gives the alliance its decisive military
edge.]{.underline} That is entirely doable. But [don't expect it to
happen in Madrid---or **anytime soon**]{.underline}.

### Russia Won't Use Nuclear Weapons 

#### Nuclear use unlikely by Putin \-\-- would make him a pariah and alienate Russia from the international community

**Wormuth, 22 \-\-- Secretary of the Army, US Department of Defense**

VIVIAN SALAMA: Before we move on to another subject, just a really blunt
question, being that [there is concern that]{.underline} President
[Putin could resort to nuclear weapons at some stage, especially if he
gets desperate]{.underline} in this conflict. What is the Army's role in
preventing that kind of a scenario, especially absent direct military
involvement in Ukraine?

CHRISTINE WORMUTH: You know, I think what we can do---I mean, first of
all, I think it's important to say that, you know, we are undoubtedly
looking at that type of contingency and trying to think through what our
options---you know, what options would be available to policymakers if
that were to happen? The Army, I think what we can most, you know,
helpfully do is to try to provide training for how to operate under
those kinds of conditions. You know, we have personal protective
equipment and things like that. But I think, you know, [if Putin were to
decide to use some sort of tactical nuclear demonstration]{.underline},
I think, you know, [that would **erase**]{.underline}, in my mind,
[**any possibility** that he could be anything other than a pariah
leader]{.underline} and a---leader of a pariah state, you know, [for
decades]{.underline} going forward. So I think that [Putin would have to
think extremely long and hard about that, since he clearly wants to try
to bring Russia back into the international community at some point. I
don't see how he does that if he goes nuclear.]{.underline}

<https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/17/will-turkey-block-nato-membership-for-sweden-and-finland.html>)
//AB

[Turkish President]{.underline} Recep Tayyip Erdogan has [**doubled
down** on]{.underline} his [opposition to Sweden and Finland
joining]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline} alliance, a move that would
be historic for the two Nordic countries in the wake of [Russia's
invasion of
Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/17/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html).

["We will not say 'yes' to those \[countries\] who apply sanctions to
Turkey to join security organization NATO,"]{.underline} [Erdogan
said]{.underline} at a news conference late Monday. He was [referring to
Sweden's suspension of weapons sales to Turkey]{.underline} in 2019 over
its military activities in Syria.

Sweden's Foreign Ministry said Monday that it planned to send senior
officials joining with officials from Finland to the Turkish capital of
Ankara to address Erdogan's objections. But the Turkish leader
essentially said they'd be wasting their time.

["**Will they come to persuade us?** Excuse us, but **they shouldn't
bother**,"]{.underline} Erdogan said. He added that the two countries
joining would make NATO "a place where representatives of terrorist
organizations are concentrated."

#### Turkey won't vote for membership until Sweden and Finland address Kurdish activists

**Wintour, 22 -- Diplomatic Editor of The Guardian** \[Patrick; 6/14/22;
The Guardian; "Turkey threatens year's delay to Swedish and Finnish
entry to Nato";
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/14/turkey-threatens-years-delay-to-swedish-and-finnish-entry-to-nato>;
accessed 6/18/22; DWC\]

[Turkey]{.underline} has said it is [willing to delay Swedish and
Finnish membership of Nato for **more than a year** unless it receives
satisfactory assurances that the two]{.underline} Nordic countries [are
willing to address support for Kurdish groups it regards as terrorist
organisations]{.underline}.

Finland's prime minister said on Tuesday that the [two nations' Nato
applications could stall if the issue is not resolved]{.underline}
before a vital [Nato summit]{.underline} due to start [in Madrid on 29
June.]{.underline}

[Turkey accuses Sweden and Finland of harbouring alleged members of the
Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK)]{.underline} and also [objects to their
decisions in 2019 to ban arms exports to]{.underline} Ankara due to
Turkey's military operations in Syria.

Turkey has gone on a public diplomacy offensive to highlight [Swedish
support for Kurdish groups]{.underline} in northern Syria that it [links
to the PKK -- designated as a terrorist organisation in the EU, US and
Turkey]{.underline} -- and is planning to stage a fringe meeting on the
issue at the Nato summit.

"This is a matter of vital national interest, and [we are prepared to
prevent their membership for as long as a year if necessary," said Akif
Çağatay Kılıç, an MP for the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP)
and chair of the Turkish parliament's foreign affairs
committee]{.underline}. "[Turkey is the second largest army in
Nato]{.underline} and has been providing the drones that help Ukraine
defend itself. We [deserve greater respect]{.underline}."

He said Turkey respected its own duties and responsibilities to the
alliance. "What are \[Sweden and Finland\] going to do? [They have been
harbouring terrorist organisations that kill my people, disrespect my
borders, pose an existential threat to my country.]{.underline} The only
thing we demand is that there are no distinctions. [A terrorist
organisation is a terrorist organisation."]{.underline}

He [denied the crisis was an attempt to fan nationalist flames before
difficult elections]{.underline}, saying the non-Kurdish opposition
parties were supportive of the stance of the president, Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan. He also said there was no attempt to barter with the US over
arms deals.

During a visit to Sweden on Tuesday, Finland's prime minister, Sanna
Marin, warned: "[If we don't solve these issues before \[the\] Madrid
\[summit]{.underline}\], there is a risk that the [situation will
freeze]{.underline}.

"We don't know for how long but it might freeze [for a
while]{.underline}."

Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, has praised Swedish
efforts to address Turkey's concerns, but seems to have recognised that
[plans for a fast-track membership may now be disappearing.]{.underline}

The Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, is due to attend the
summit, which may end up being a show of division as much as it is
concerned with long-term strategic thinking and enlargement. Privately,
western officials admit that Germany, France and the US are not keen to
have Ukraine dominate the summit, although it is hard to imagine Nato
support for Kyiv not being the central issue.

On Friday Sweden tried to mollify Turkey by publishing a foreign policy
paper that highlighted the need to fight terrorism, and opened a path
for Sweden to resume arms export sales to Turkey. Sweden imposed
restrictions on arms sales in 2019 after Turkey's invasion of northern
Syria. Britain has already lifted the sales ban.

The policy paper said Sweden would "contribute to all of Nato's security
including that of Turkey". A tougher anti-terrorism law, due to come
into force on 1 July, gives the Swedish intelligence services greater
latitude to monitor communications of suspected terrorist sympathisers.

Although [Turkish demands]{.underline} can vary, [officials have said
they want to see specific Kurdish activists deported to Turkey, as well
as the sacking of the Swedish defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, over a
2011 meeting with the PKK, which has been designated as a terrorist
organisation in Sweden since 1984.]{.underline}

Ankara would like the two countries to sever ties with the US-backed
Syrian Kurdish autonomous administration, which Turkey says has a
synonymous leadership to the PKK.

Andersson's room for manoeuvre is limited, in that she is not [going to
transform Swedish extradition laws simply to satisfy the threats coming
from the Turkish president,]{.underline} and last week she had to rely
on the support of a Kurdish Swedish MP and former peshmerga fighter,
Amineh Kakabaveh, to survive a narrow confidence vote. The MP says she
received unspecified guarantees in return for her vote.

[Sweden is home to 100,000 Kurdish refugees.]{.underline}

Turkish diplomats resent suggestions that it did not make its objections
to Swedish membership earlier or that it is being hypocritical about the
Kurdish issue due to its support for extremist groups elsewhere in the
Middle East.

[Finland]{.underline} has fewer problems with Turkey, but has said it is
[unlikely to press ahead with a membership request without
Sweden.]{.underline}

Finnish media reported that the country received 10 Turkey-related
extradition requests between 2019 and 2022. It granted two of those
requests and is processing seven.

While Britain has strong diplomatic ties with Turkey, it has also given
security assurances to the two Nordic countries during the potentially
dangerous grey period between their application to join Nato and the
moment when full membership gives them the alliance's collective defence
protection.

In an effort to find a resolution, the UK's Europe minister, James
Cleverly, is in Turkey this week to meet ministers. Angus Lapsley, the
director for Euro-Atlantic security at the Foreign Office, said the UK
was working night and day to try to resolve the dispute.

Stoltenberg has said the Madrid summit was never a deadline.

#### Turkey is demanding steps by Finland and Sweden before it supports accession

**Tosu, 22 -- Director of International Programs at the University of
Nevada** (6/23/2022, Mehmet, 2022\"Unity, solidarity against common
threats key for NATO, Türkiye tells US,\" No Publication;

DOA: 6-23-2022) SMTX//BSA

[There must be unity, harmony and solidarity among NATO allies against
common security]{.underline} and terrorist [threats]{.underline},
[Türkiye's Presidential spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin said]{.underline} in
a phone call with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on
Thursday.

Along with bilateral political and economic ties, the officials held
discussions on Türkiye's role in NATO and contributions to the alliance,
the upcoming NATO Madrid summit, Sweden and Finland's NATO bids, grain
shipments through the Black Sea and other regional issues, according to
a statement from the Turkish presidential spokesperson.

They exchanged views on issues on the agenda for next week's NATO
summit, including its new Strategic Concept, the Ukraine war, the fight
against terrorism, the global food crisis and other security issues, the
statement said.

[Kalin]{.underline} [emphasized]{.underline} that NATO allies must have
a unified stance against common security and terrorist threats,
reiterating [that Sweden and Finland **must fulfill Türkiye's demands**
and expectations]{.underline} in the fight against terrorism.

Since Sweden and Finland formally applied to join NATO last month,
[Türkiye]{.underline}, a longstanding member of the alliance, [has
repeatedly voiced objections over the countries' tolerance, and even
support, for terrorist groups, particularly the PKK terrorist
organization.]{.underline}

Kalin stressed that **[no progress could be made]{.underline}** on the
matter [**until** Sweden and Finland take concrete steps.]{.underline}

He underlined that [it was unacceptable that PKK]{.underline}/PYD/YPG
[supporters are disseminating propaganda in Stockholm]{.underline} and
through the media while Ankara remains engaged in talks with the two
Nordic countries.

He also conveyed that [Türkiye is continuing negotiations with Ukraine
and Russia on creating a safe corridor for grain shipments through the
Black Sea.]{.underline}

Achieving results from this negotiation process, which includes the UN,
is of strategic importance for global food security, he added.

#### Turkey has several concerns about Sweden and Finland that could [derail]{.underline} or at least [delay]{.underline} accession 

**Ünlühisarcıklı, 22 \-- manager of the Resource Development Department
of the Educational Volunteers Foundation of Turkey** \[5-19-2022, Özgür,
"Erdoğan Will Not Walk Away Empty-Handed,"
<https://www.gmfus.org/news/finland-and-sweden-apply-join-nato-whats-next>,
accessed on 6-18-2022, LKK\]

[Sweden and Finland's decision to apply for NATO membership is welcome
with enthusiasm across the Atlantic, but **Turkey may spoil the
party**.]{.underline}

In an unexpected move, President Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan has announced
that he does not favor the two countries' membership to NATO on the
grounds that they are havens for terrorist organizations targeting
Turkey, specifically the]{.underline} Kurdistan Workers'
Party [(PKK]{.underline}) and its offshoots. Both Sweden and Finland
reject this claim but remain open to discussions with Turkey on the
subject.

[It would be a mistake to dismiss Erdoğan's stance as being motivated by
domestic political considerations alone or to expect him to walk back
empty-handed. **Turkey has real concerns** and will **likely delay** the
upcoming NATO enlargement unless those concerns are addressed by Sweden
and Finland.]{.underline}

[Erdoğan is playing a two-level game here. At the international level,
he aims to further weaken the PKK. In Turkey's view, separatist
terrorism is the single most important security]{.underline} threat and
whether others agree is not relevant for its calculus. [Degrading the
PKK has been, and remains, a priority for every government in Turkey
since the 1980s.]{.underline}

[At the domestic level, he aims to portray himself as a strong leader
who can protect Turkey's interests internationally in a way that his
predecessors could not]{.underline}. According to the [Turkish
Perceptions of the European Union 2021
Survey](https://www.gmfus.org/news/turkish-perceptions-european-union) conducted
by the German Marshall Fund of the United States, [67.9 percent of
Turkish respondents believe that the European countries want to divide
and disintegrate Turkey, just like they did to the Ottoman Empire in the
past.]{.underline} Moreover, 70.1 percent believe that the European
countries have helped strengthen separationist organizations such as the
PKK in Turkey. As such, Erdoğan's criticism toward Sweden and Finland
will easily resonate with the Turkish people.

[It would also be a mistake for Ankara to underestimate the magnitude of
the decision to delay a historical NATO enlargement and the negative
reaction it would face from each and every NATO ally at a time when
Turkey is trying to bridge the gap between itself and its Western
allies.]{.underline}

[Turkish, Swedish, and Finnish diplomats, with support from other
allies, can and should find common ground to address the concerns
regarding]{.underline} the stance of Sweden and Finland [toward the PKK
and ensure that NATO enlargement can proceed without delay.]{.underline}
The accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO is so important, for Turkey
as well, that this problem will likely be resolved through dialogue and
empathy. But it will not go away on its own.

#### Turkey blocks Finland and Sweden from joining NATO

**Coşkun, 22** -- senior fellow at CEIP and former director general for
int-security affairs at the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (June
24, 22; Alper Coşkun; "Turkey and NATO are stronger with each other.
They must de-thorne their relationship";
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/turkeysource/turkey-and-nato-are-stronger-with-each-other-they-must-de-thorn-their-relationship/AI)

As NATO prepares for its summit in Madrid next week[, Turkey is in the
headlines for holding up Finland and Sweden's bids to join the
Alliance]{.underline}---irking not only the two candidate countries, but
also their would-be NATO allies.

[Ankara wants Helsinki and Stockholm to stop harboring and supporting
individuals affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which it
considers to be a terrorist organization]{.underline} (and is recognized
as such by both the United States and the European Union[). It also
demands an end to the arms embargoes imposed by these countries after
Turkey's military operation in northern Syria]{.underline} in 2019.
President Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan has made it clear that **nothing short
of concrete steps** will be enough to reverse Turkey's
stance.]{.underline}

Turkey's concerns are serious and, as stated by NATO Secretary General
Jens Stoltenberg, they are "legitimate." Yet Russia's invasion of
Ukraine and the belated manner in which Ankara has publicly raised its
concerns have muddled that important reality, tainting Turkey and its
role in the Alliance.

#### Turkey will still block Sweden and Finland \-\-- disagreement over PKK issue 

**Alaaldin, 22 -- Nonresident Fellow for Foreign Policy at the Center
for Middle East Policy at Brookings** (Ranj, 2022\"Turkey's threat to
derail Swedish and Finnish NATO accession reraises the Kurdish
question,\" Brookings;

6-21-2022) SMTX//BSA

[Turkey's opposition to Sweden and Finland joining]{.underline} the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization [(NATO) in the wake of Russia's war
on Ukraine has elevated the Kurdish question on the international
stage.]{.underline} President Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan is attempting to
capitalize on the urgency of fortifying Western deterrence by increasing
the pressure on the]{.underline} Kurdistan Workers' Party
[(PKK).]{.underline} The insurgent group has fought the Turkish state
for five decades to secure greater rights for Turkey's Kurds but enjoyed
a rapid ascension with the onset of the Syrian civil war and
Washington's 2014 decision to partner with its sister organization to
defeat the Islamic State group (IS).

[The PKK has constituted a major component of Turkey's relationship with
Europe and the United States for decades, and Erdoğan has initiated
several military campaigns into Syria's northeast to suppress
the]{.underline} autonomous enclave the [PKK's sister organization, the
Peoples' Protection Units (YPG]{.underline}), formed in the midst of the
civil war. While [Turkey]{.underline} may be using the Nordic NATO
accession talks to receive Western backing for another campaign, it [has
a long record of carrying out cross-border incursions against the
PKK]{.underline} and Erdoğan may also be trying to secure other
concessions, including the lifting of embargoes on Turkey's defense
industry.

But [Ankara's opposition to Swedish and Finnish accession]{.underline},
based on their refusal to extradite PKK members, as well as followers of
the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen (whom Ankara accuses of instigating a
2016 coup attempt), [highlights that the Kurdish question cannot be
decoupled from Western security interests.]{.underline} The tectonic
shifts that have taken place in the global security order since Russia
invaded Ukraine means that the second-order effects of the war against
IS and [the proximity of the Kurdish question to U.S. and European
security interests requires a reprioritization of the issue in the
West.]{.underline}

[Turkey's conflict with the PKK has long complicated Turkey's relations
with the U.S.]{.underline} and its European allies. Relations have been
in flux and either enhanced or upended by shifting fault lines in the
Middle East since the 2011 Arab uprisings and the emergence of IS.
Although [the 2013 peace process between the Turkish state and the
PKK]{.underline} raised hopes of a lasting settlement, the fragile truce
[was upended in 2015]{.underline} by the YPG's ascension in Syria, its
refusal to prioritize the fall of the Assad regime, and deep-seated
animosities. [The result was a renewal of a domestic
conflict]{.underline} that has taken on multiple transnational
dimensions [and produced untold humanitarian crises.]{.underline}

[Ankara has for decades questioned Europe's commitment to addressing its
security concerns.]{.underline} In the 1990s, [Greece and Italy provided
refuge to the PKK's imprisoned founder and leader]{.underline}, Abdullah
Öcalan, and [the PKK established an expansive
infrastructure]{.underline}, including [in Sweden]{.underline}, [that
allows it to mobilize supporters]{.underline} and resources in Europe
and in Turkey. [European leaders had hoped to leverage Turkey's EU
accession process to improve Turkey's human rights records]{.underline}
[but]{.underline} talks stagnated more than a decade ago and [both sides
have effectively given up on it.]{.underline}

[Similarly]{.underline}, in addition to supporting the YPG, [the U.S.
has provoked Erdoğan's ire by refusing to extradite the
Pennsylvania-based Gülen]{.underline}, [while Washington also imposed
tariffs on Turkish steel]{.underline} and aluminium [after an
agreement]{.underline} to release pastor Andrew Brunson [fell through in
2018]{.underline}. [Ankara]{.underline} did U.S.-Turkey relations no
favours by [purchasing Russian air defense systems, after which
Washington imposed sanctions]{.underline} on Turkey.

[Turkey's relations with the West will continue to be crisis-driven amid
a range of ongoing tensions]{.underline}, including over the conflict in
Libya, the eastern Mediterranean crisis, tensions with the EU over the
future of 3 million Syrian refugees in Turkey, and NATO expansion in
response to Russia's aggression. Putting Turkish responsibility for the
current state of affairs to one side, the trans-Atlantic alliance is
guilty of failing to establish forward-looking approaches to tumult in
Turkey's Middle Eastern neighborhood, opting instead for incoherent and
reactive engagement that has put issues like the PKK conflict and
broader Kurdish political questions on the back burner.

The failure to mitigate the second-order effects of policies designed to
address security threats like IS has allowed Ankara to exploit the
West's failure to balance the imperative of securing the defeat of the
jihadis with the need to manage the security interests of regional
actors like Turkey. This has had serious strategic implications, as
evidenced by the current dispute over NATO membership and the pressure
NATO has faced as a result of the ebb in relations and disputes over the
YPG's dominance in Syria.

### U.S.-Turkey Relations Low

#### U.S.-Turkey relations are low now \-\-- erodes consensus building

#### Coşkun, 22 -- senior fellow at CEIP and former director general for int-security affairs at the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs **(June 24, 22; Alper Coşkun; "Turkey and NATO are stronger with each other. They must de-thorne their relationship"; https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/turkeysource/turkey-and-nato-are-stronger-with-each-other-they-must-de-thorn-their-relationship/, AI)**

Restoring the balance

But [**serious thorns remain in Turkey's relations** with certain
allies, and the estrangement risks undermining NATO's resilience at a
critical juncture.]{.underline}

For one, [Turkey is **deeply irritated** that the United States and
others are partnering with the People's Protection Units]{.underline}
(YPG), [the Syrian branch of the PKK, in the fight against the Islamic
State. It is also frustrated at the imposition of arms embargoes---or
covert restrictions on arms sales]{.underline}---by its allies over
issues like Ankara's purchase of Russian-made S-400 air-defense systems,
its Syria policy, and its support for Azerbaijan in the 2020 war against
Armenia. [These differences have led to a **mutual erosion of trust**
between Turkey and its allies, sometimes making consensus-building on
critical matters difficult.]{.underline}

[The Syria issue has, over time, become the most harmful one, pushing
Turkey to the extreme on a matter it considers to be of existential
nature: fighting terrorism.]{.underline} The first public manifestation
of this deepening discord came before NATO leaders met in London in
2019---where Turkey held out until the last minute before begrudgingly
endorsing Poland's and the Baltic states' defense plans. Ankara was
reacting to a hold that had previously been placed on its own defense
plans at the behest of the United States, rooted in disagreement about
how to refer to the YPG.

### Congress Will Delay NATO Expansion 

#### Senate will delay approval for expansion \-\-- could take several months

**Auerswald 22 -- Professor of Security Studies at the U.S. National War
College** \[David Auerswald, May 17, 2022, "How the US Senate could slow
down Sweden and Finland's NATO future"
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/how-the-us-senate-could-slow-down-sweden-and-finlands-nato-future/
Acc 6/21/22 ER\]

[If history is any guide, the Senate will overwhelmingly support adding
Finland and Sweden to NATO]{.underline} (certainly by more than the
two-thirds required by the Constitution). [That was the case in
1998]{.underline}, when senators supported membership for the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and Poland [by an 80-19 vote]{.underline}; in
[2003,]{.underline} when senators unanimously welcomed Bulgaria,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia [by a 96-0
vote]{.underline}; in [2008]{.underline}, when senators admitted Albania
and Croatia [by voice vote]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} in
[2017]{.underline} and [2019]{.underline}, when it approved Montenegro
and Northern Macedonia, respectively, to join the Alliance [with only
two dissenting votes each time]{.underline}.

[The more interesting question is **how long it will take the Senate**
to provide its advice and consent]{.underline}---and here the record
does not bode well. [The amended treaty is likely to be signed in the
next few weeks, perhaps even before the NATO Summit]{.underline} at the
end of June. [That means the Senate]{.underline}, which is typically in
recess during August, [would need to hold hearings and vote in June and
July, September and October, or wait until a lame duck
session]{.underline} after the midterm elections. [The fastest
enlargement process, in 2003, took a month and a half from the NATO
signing ceremony to final Senate passage]{.underline}. [Other rounds
took much longer]{.underline}: The 1998 round took more than four
months, while the 2017 and 2019 enlargements took more than ten and
eight months, respectively. [The war in Ukraine could certainly speed up
the process, but **do not be surprised if the Senate process drags into
the fall**.]{.underline}

Another [question is whether senators will condition their votes on
changes in administration policy]{.underline}. In 1997, for example,
Republican Sen. Jesse Helms withheld support for the Chemical Weapons
Convention until the Clinton administration agreed to abolish the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency and the US Information Agency.

[Senators can also use more subtle means to change policy]{.underline}.
In [providing]{.underline} treaty advice and consent, senators pass what
is called [a ratification document that affirms that Washington will
abide by the treaty's terms]{.underline}. [Senators can add]{.underline}
all sorts [of reservations, understandings, and conditions to that
document]{.underline}. For example, senators have specified that
arms-control treaties do not limit US missile-defense capabilities.

[Nothing in the Constitution or US law requires]{.underline} that
[these]{.underline} reservations, understandings, or conditions [be
limited to the treaty itself]{.underline}. [That means senators can add
clauses requiring executive-branch reports to Congress on unrelated
foreign-policy issues, prohibitions on certain kinds of executive-branch
behavior, or administration acceptance of a senator's foreign-policy
initiative]{.underline}. For instance, senators included provisions on
Nazi war crimes and unrelated prisoner-of-war issues in the 1998 NATO
enlargement document. And a document addressing the 1988
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty specified the allowable
parameters of future conventional arms control and human-rights
agreements with the Soviet Union.

[The record demonstrates that the chamber is more likely to add (perhaps
unrelated) conditions to treaties dealing with important security issues
such as NATO membership when the United States lacks a foreign-policy
consensus]{.underline}, or when it is facing few international threats.
Given the war in Ukraine, expanding NATO would seem to qualify as an
important issue and one on which there is near-consensus on the Russian
threat and NATO's role in deterring it. This suggests that we will see
conditions added to the NATO enlargement ratification document, but not
the dozens that have been added to other security treaties. The fewer
the conditions, the faster will be the Senate debate.

Still, [ultra-partisan senators tend to insert non-germane conditions
and significant reporting requirements on any number of issues into
treaty ratification documents]{.underline}---something we can expect
from today's polarized Senate. [That slows the process]{.underline}.

[The Senate debate over NATO's enlargement is likely to yield a positive
result. But the question is how long that debate will take and what
conditions senators may levy on the administration in exchange for their
votes]{.underline}.

### NATO Expansion =\> Nuclear War with Russia

#### NATO expansion risks Russian nuclear aggression \-\-- wants to secure border with Finland

Additionally, [neither country currently meets the 2 percent of GDP
defense spending goal that was agreed to by NATO members]{.underline}.
Just as in other parts of Europe, a security guarantee provided by the
United States could encourage free-riding and disincentivize increased
investment in defense capabilities in favor of more spending on
politically popular social programs.

But most dangerously, [adding Finland and Sweden to NATO will **increase
the risk of a nuclear confrontation with Russia**]{.underline}. As a
result of its failures in Ukraine, the threat posed by Russia's
conventional forces has been reduced. But [Russia]{.underline} still
[possesses a large nuclear arsenal]{.underline} that, [according to the
head of the Defense Intelligence Agency]{.underline}, [they
will]{.underline} likely [rely on more to secure their borders ---
including the nearly 850-mile]{.underline} one [they share with Finland.
NATO membership]{.underline} for Finland and Sweden [includes
extending]{.underline} the umbrella of [America's nuclear deterrent to
both nations,]{.underline} thus [elevating the risk that any border
dispute could escalate into a nuclear exchange.]{.underline}

[Instead]{.underline} of enabling NATO accession for Finland and Sweden,
the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should take actions to
encourage the strengthening and development of non-NATO security
architectures in Europe like the Nordic Defence Cooperation, which
Finland and Sweden are already a part of.]{.underline} The [failures of
Russia's military]{.underline} in Ukraine have
[demonstrated]{.underline} that collectively [Europe is]{.underline}
more than [capable of securing itself without significant U.S. support,
as long they properly prioritize defense investments.]{.underline}

[It is not in the national interest of the United States, through NATO,
to commit to defend two wealthy European welfare states]{.underline}
whose neutrality has kept them safe and prosperous for more than 70
years. While some insist Russia's invasion of Ukraine changes
everything, the fact remains that [new security guarantees will force
trade-offs, consume more resources, and increase the likelihood of a
**confrontation with a nuclear-armed adversary**]{.underline}.

Despite rhetoric from NATO evangelists that can often give the contrary
impression, [adding Finland and Sweden to NATO will lead to increased
costs for the U.S.]{.underline}

Admitting [both nations]{.underline} to NATO could [generate up-front
expenses of over \$8 billion along with \$1.5 billion in additional
annual costs.]{.underline} And while [U.S. military leaders]{.underline}
are currently claiming that their membership in NATO won't lead to a
permanent stationing of troops in either nation, they do [admit that
more U.S. troops will likely rotate to both Finland and Sweden on a more
frequent basis.]{.underline} This [will place further strain on a U.S.
military]{.underline} that is [already struggling to sustain
deployments]{.underline} in support of dozens of ongoing operations
[including active combat missions in Iraq, Syria, and
Somalia.]{.underline}

One [frequent]{.underline}ly cited [justification]{.underline} for
admitting Finland and Sweden to NATO [is that they have capable
militaries that would enhance NATO.]{.underline} However, the [reality
is]{.underline} that [both countries have relatively small professional
militaries]{.underline} of around 20,000 troops each [that rely on large
reserve forces]{.underline} in a time of war [and]{.underline} which
[lack long-range force projection capabilities]{.underline}.
[Sweden]{.underline} is [already requesting a larger U.S. naval presence
in the Baltic Sea]{.underline}, calling into [question the ability of
their military to secure their own backyard.]{.underline}

Additionally, [neither country]{.underline} currently [meets the 2
percent of GDP defense spending goal]{.underline} that was agreed to by
NATO members. [Just as in other parts of Europe]{.underline}, a
[security guarantee provided by the United States]{.underline} could
[encourage free-riding and disincentivize increased investment in
defense capabilities]{.underline} in favor of more spending on
politically popular social programs.

But most dangerously, adding Finland and Sweden to NATO will increase
the risk of a nuclear confrontation with Russia. As a result of its
failures in Ukraine, the threat posed by Russia's conventional forces
has been reduced. But Russia still possesses a large nuclear arsenal
that, according to the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, they
will likely rely on more to secure their borders --- including the
nearly 850-mile one they share with Finland. NATO membership for Finland
and Sweden includes extending the umbrella of America's nuclear
deterrent to both nations, thus elevating the risk that any border
dispute could escalate into a nuclear exchange.

Instead of enabling NATO accession for Finland and Sweden, the United
States should take actions to encourage the strengthening and
development of non-NATO security architectures in Europe like the Nordic
Defence Cooperation, which Finland and Sweden are already a part of. The
failures of Russia's military in Ukraine have demonstrated that
collectively Europe is more than capable of securing itself without
significant U.S. support, as long they properly prioritize defense
investments.

At a time of [record inflation and a \$30.5 trillion national
debt]{.underline}, it is [hard to justify spending more American tax
dollars]{.underline} and [committing]{.underline} more [American troops
to defend two wealthy European social democracies.]{.underline}

This is particularly true when [neither state enhances U.S. security and
both have benefited from neutrality for decades]{.underline}. The lack
of robust debate around this important topic and the smearing of those
who dare to question the benefits of NATO expansion only [raises the
risk that]{.underline} the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
will become [overextended]{.underline}, or worse, potentially
[sleep-walk into a war with a nuclear-armed Russia.]{.underline}

After decades of foreign policy failures that have cost the United
States dearly, America's elected officials owe the American people
better than more costly security commitments disconnected from our
safety and economic prosperity.

#### Risks war with Russia -- Finland is highly exposed to military threats

Consider also the question of the defensibility of new NATO territory.
Admitting Sweden could be strategically beneficial, allowing NATO forces
to better control the Baltic Sea and to use Gotland Island, at an
important chokepoint off the Baltic States, as a staging ground for any
future conflict.

[Finnish territory]{.underline}, in contrast, [is a strategic
nightmare]{.underline}. [It would **dramatically increase** the
alliance's exposure to any future attacks by Moscow]{.underline}: [the
country shares an 800-mile border with Russia that]{.underline}, as a
recent study from the Center for Strategic and International Studies put
it, [is "highly exposed to Russian military threats."]{.underline}

There are grab bag of other reasons for caution, including the usual
concerns about expanding the alliance to an ever-more unwieldy set of
member states. It doesn't take a genius to predict that 32 nations will
be even harder to manage than 30. Before its Ukraine moment, NATO was
struggling to maintain the peace between Greece and Turkey, few nations
were meeting the 2% spending goal, and President Emmanuel Macron of
France had drawn headlines for suggesting the alliance was experiencing
"brain death."

Even in the face of Russia's aggression, support for adding the two
members isn't unanimous. Turkey's vehement opposition to Finland and
Sweden may be an attempt to wring political concessions from the
alliance, but also owes a lot to these countries' support for Kurdish
causes.

Alliance [leaders should]{.underline} also [consider the risk of
**Russian overreaction**]{.underline}. [Moscow has **started three wars
over potential NATO expansion**]{.underline} --- invading
[Georgia]{.underline} in 2008 and [Crimea]{.underline} in 2014 before
[the current war]{.underline}. While Moscow is clearly not able to stage
another major military campaign right now[, one cannot rule
out]{.underline} President Vladimir [Putin doing something irrational in
response to a NATO expansion that takes the alliance within 200 miles of
his birthplace of St. Petersburg]{.underline}.

At the same time, [it's not clear that Finland and Sweden are at
increased risk **unless they are allowed NATO membership**. They have
long relied on their neutral status and domestic defense capacity to
prevent crises. Refusing to admit them to NATO is not hanging them out
to dry, but simply **retaining a workable status quo**.]{.underline}

The symbolic value of admitting two new member states as the price for
Russia's brutality in Ukraine may carry the day in Brussels. But before
proceeding further with the accession process --- which offers leaders
and legislatures in each member state a chance to weigh in --- policy
makers should consider the whole strategic picture, and whether
admission strengthens the alliance or not.

[Article 10 of the]{.underline} North Atlantic [Treaty makes clear that
existing members may invite new states to join if they "contribute to
the security of the North Atlantic area." By that standard, the
strategic case for admitting Sweden and Finland to NATO is **not a
slam-dunk**.]{.underline}

One of the ironies of Russia's war against Ukraine --- ostensibly fought
to prevent that nation from joining the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization --- has been its impact on two of Europe's traditionally
neutral states, Finland and Sweden. On May 18, just 84 days after the
invasion, Swedish and Finnish ambassadors handed over applications to
join NATO in a public ceremony at the alliance's headquarters in
Brussels.

"This is a historic moment which we must seize," said Secretary-General
Jens Stoltenberg. "You are our closest partners, and your membership in
NATO will increase our shared security." It seems likely that their
applications will be swiftly approved, and NATO will soon grow to a 32
member states.

Yet in the rush to give Putin a black eye by embracing Finland and
Sweden, US and NATO leaders may be failing to consider the potential
costs of inducting two more countries into what, after all, is intended
to be a collective defense organization.

[There are only two clear-cut benefits to bringing in the two Nordic
nations. The first is symbolic]{.underline}: providing a clear
demonstration of European and democratic solidarity against Russian
aggression in Eastern Europe. [The second is technical: Admitting
Finland and Sweden would better align the membership of NATO with that
of the EU]{.underline}, avoiding the unlikely but problematic scenario
in which an EU member state is subject to aggression but is not covered
by NATO's Article 5 mutual-defense pact.

[In **every other respect**]{.underline}, however, [the
question]{.underline} of Finnish and Swedish membership [is more
complicated and worrisome]{.underline}. Consider overall European
defense capacity.

Yes, Finland and Sweden have highly advanced economies. They could be
net contributors to NATO's technological capabilities through national
champions like Ericsson AB and Nokia Oyj. They are also more capable
militarily than some other European states --- particularly Finland,
which has maintained conscription into the post-Cold War period and has
a relatively wide range of military competencies, including the
continent's largest artillery force.

Yet from [the point of view of existing NATO members]{.underline} ---
and [particularly the US]{.underline} --- [it's still not necessarily a
net win]{.underline}. [Finland and Sweden have long focused their
militaries on defending their own territories, **raising doubts** about
their value in contributing to a common defense, which is at the heart
of NATO's charter.]{.underline}

And [while both nations have pledged to increase their military
spending]{.underline} and ability to bolster Europe's broader defenses,
[it is also possible that they would not. Instead]{.underline}, they may
**[free-ride on America]{.underline}**'s military strength --- and its
nuclear umbrella --- [as so many European states have done for
years]{.underline}. According to the International Monetary Fund,
neither country comes close to meeting the NATO goal of spending 2% of
GDP on defense.

[History suggests the most likely outcome is two more states **adding to
America's defense burden** at a time when **Washington should be
pivoting to Asia**.]{.underline}

America's strategic interest in the European balance is not under any
significant threat from a potential hegemonic challenge that seeks to
dominate the entirety of European landmass under one army and one
flag.26 During the early years of the Republic, American grand strategy
in Europe was one of cautious detachment and non-interference in the
imperial affairs of the European great powers. [After the fall of the
traditional historic balancer of Europe]{.underline}, the British
empire, and facing two world wars and hegemonic threats to security from
Imperial, and subsequently Nazi Germany, [American strategy evolved to
one that mirrored the historic British grand-strategy of "offshore
balancing," that ensured that America would intervene whenever there was
a hegemonic threat in the European horizon]{.underline}. To that end,
the interests of the United States, much like the British empire before
her, is to ensure a militarily disunited Europe, and maintain open trade
and sea routes.

The difference in this instance was that the British aspired to attain
this objective through a delicate "balance of power" within the
continent with minimal interference to tilt the balance as and when
required, while cautiously avoiding continuous engagement in the
domestic affairs of European countries, or commitments about spreading
rights and values. [While the American interest in ensuring no hegemonic
threat in the European continent remained intact, the American
grand-strategy]{.underline}, especially after the collapse of the Soviet
Union, [deviated from an earlier realist one]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline} in turn [sought]{.underline} [to institutionalise peace
across the continent, while ensuring fundamental human rights in every
corner]{.underline} -- or in the words of John Mearsheimer and Barry
Posen, ensure primacy and spread "liberal hegemony."

[Unfortunately, that resulted in the atrophy of Europe's traditional
security providers]{.underline}--the western powers--and at the same
time, encouraged free riding on American treasure and muscle. [The
institutionalisation of peace, first through an expansion of
NATO]{.underline} and then through support of the EU, also [resulted in
buckpassing wherein Western European great powers are perfectly content
to wave the EU flag but simultaneously rely on the US tax-funded
security subsidies]{.underline}. The [Eastern European
powers]{.underline} are permanently activist with lofty rhetoric about
values and human rights, meanwhile leaving the security burden in large
part to be covered by the US. [Both Western]{.underline} European states
[and]{.underline} the [Eastern European states act rationally based on
their narrow security interests, and that is perfectly understandable.
The narrow American interest is the only one ignored in this
context]{.underline}.

[Several American presidents and policymakers]{.underline}, from Dwight
Eisenhower to John Kennedy to Donald Trump, [have attempted to grapple
with European free-riding]{.underline} and "buckpassing."27 [Various
attempts were made either through implicit warnings]{.underline} (such
as Bob Gates' final speech to NATO in 2011) [or explicit
threats]{.underline} (under the Trump Administration) [to
encourage]{.underline} or compel [Western European powers to shoulder
more security burden]{.underline} and provide security umbrella to
theatres in Eastern Europe.28

[Further enlargement of NATO in the current scenario risks doubling down
on American security commitments]{.underline}. [That, coupled
with]{.underline} [unlimited financial aid for Ukraine]{.underline}, or
further permanent troop additions in theatres of Eastern Europe,
[reverses all the recent gains that were made to require Europe to fund
more of its own security]{.underline} requirements. [In the face of
renewed Russian aggression, a one-time US infusion of resources and
weaponry to Ukraine may have been understandable, as were enhanced
bilateral alignments with Finland and Sweden]{.underline}. However[,
those efforts should have been accompanied by]{.underline} corresponding
[requirements]{.underline} [that]{.underline} rich [European states
shoulder the long-term localized security]{.underline} architecture and
endure the majority of the future cost. This is especially so [given
that a localized war]{.underline} in the periphery of their continent
[is of far more strategic significance to Europeans, than it is to the
United States.]{.underline} As the accompanying chart demonstrates, it
is not justifiable to American taxpayers that Europe is once again
subsidized by the US.

Instead, the Biden administration is absolutely determined to double
down on the failures of the post-Cold-war strategy in supporting the
addition of Finland and Sweden to NATO[. The shift of NATO frontiers
further to the east and north, and adding more buffer states, would only
disincentivize rich Western European nations from providing security in
their own backyard]{.underline}. With the rising threat of a near-peer
rival in China, severe economic downturn, and looming strategic
trade-offs, committing more to NATO is irresponsible and imprudent.

### NATO Expansion Unnecessary -- Sweden & Finland Already Capable

Within ten weeks, Finland's eight decades-long equidistance, and
Sweden's two centuries long neutrality were jettisoned, in favor of
unprecedented levels of military bloc formations and foreign military
power support pledges, most notably from fellow Scandinavian nations:
Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and a post-Brexit Britain.5 Having rejected
their historic neutrality, Finland and Sweden have now made formal
applications to NATO membership. However, [the new desire for NATO
membership should not be construed as revealing a lack of current
defenses]{.underline} or alertness [towards]{.underline} the danger
posed by [Russia]{.underline}.

[The existing force postures of Finland and Sweden are **uniquely
designed to deter Russia unilaterally**.]{.underline} The Finnish force
of 280,000 is augmented by around 900,000 reservists who are trained for
wartime.6 Finland never abolished conscription, so [the Finnish
population is functionally ready for wartime service at a moment's
notice]{.underline}. [Finnish "Comprehensive Security" stresses training
to balance Russian hybrid warfare]{.underline}, with intelligence
exchange, interoperability, and training with Western forces.7 [Finnish
strategy]{.underline} of insurgency as a deterrence tactic to blunt
massive occupation forces [is designed with Russia in mind]{.underline}.
Finnish [defence spending is roughly 2% of GDP and certain to
increase]{.underline}.8 [Finland is thus well positioned]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} blunt and [deter]{.underline} any [Russian invasion on
its own]{.underline} and is almost certain to have major western support
in arms and resources in case of a war, even without NATO membership, as
Ukraine has enjoyed.

[Sweden]{.underline} saw major cuts in defense spending and manpower in
the immediate post-Cold War era similar to other major powers, but
[brought back conscription in 2017,]{.underline} after some deliberation
[following the Russian annexation of Crimea]{.underline} in 2014.9
[Sweden]{.underline} boasted of mass conscription during the Cold War
and [had one of the largest trained militarie]{.underline}s, which were
downsized as the Soviet threat receded[. Sweden is also fortunate to
have]{.underline} the Baltic states and Finland as [buffer states from a
direct Russian land invasion]{.underline}. [In recent days]{.underline}
however[, Sweden increased its draf]{.underline}t by 4,000 soldiers per
year and reinstated a garrison on a dormant but strategic island base in
Visby, Gotland. [Overall, both Sweden and Finland have been and arguably
are capable of deterring a Russian push for conquest]{.underline}.10

The Case Against NATO Expansion:

In a recent open survey of Euro-Atlantic foreign policy experts, a
question was posed about whether Finnish and Swedish memberships are
useful for NATO. The answers ranged from "no doubt," to "certainly," and
"definitely," to "straight yes" and "enormously so," before reaching the
broad consensus that the accession of Finland and Sweden would
"strengthen the alliance's defenses and greatly increase security in the
Baltic region." There was not a single voice of dissent.11 While this
might be exemplary of a typical selection bias in such quarters, and
design flaw in open question surveys, the Atlanticist foreign policy
community has been overwhelmingly supportive of adding further
commitments and members in the alliance. This is symptomatic of the long
generational and ideological shift in foreign policy thinking in
Washington, from serious scholarly opposition to NATO's first round of
expansion during the Clinton administration, to an overwhelming support
in recent days.12

Support for Finnish and Swedish membership can be categorized into three
broad arguments.13 First, that Russia's invasion of Ukraine unleashed an
intense "security dilemma" and the smaller states who now feel
threatened should be immediately added as protectorates and the western
(primarily American) nuclear umbrella extended. Second, Sweden and
Finland are already de facto part of the Western alliance, through
either regional cooperative frameworks such as the Nordic Defense
Cooperation and Joint Expeditionary Force, or collaborations within the
EU framework and partnerships with NATO. Third, Sweden and Finland
already have strong militaries and countries with democratic
foundations, and both bring unique deterrence capabilities and
strengthen NATO's northern flank which will make NATO stronger. These
arguments are contradictory, often paradoxical, and strategically
flawed.

[The]{.underline} first line of [argument]{.underline} -- [that the
Russian threat has morphed to now require NATO protection -- is
predicated on Sweden and Finland's threat perceptions]{.underline}.
While Russia's revanchism in Ukraine is clear, the fundamental security
dynamic has not changed. At the time of this brief[, Russia is suffering
from enormous and potentially unbridgeable battlefield setbacks. The
Russian dash to Kiev failed, and Moscow is seemingly unable to
compensate battlefield attrition]{.underline}, including an overwhelming
number of officer class attrition, unthinkable for any other top-tier
military and unseen in any other recent conflicts. The Russian
battlegroups are not in full operational strength. Russia is unable to
fill the gaps created by casualties, troop morale is low, and around a
fifth of Russian invasion force hardware have been destroyed. In short,
[Russia is in no position to continue a "war of conquest," much less a
war of occupation or attrition,]{.underline} without declaring a "total
war" that requires vast levels of domestic conscription, which is of
course, politically unpopular and potentially volatile for Vladimir
Putin. While there have been some indications of a willingness to
broaden the Russian military base, it is certainly not in the interests
of Western policymakers to incentivize such a development. The
much-vaunted Russian military reforms quite clearly did not materialize.
The Russian-backed air war over Syria was dependent on Syrian regime
troops as cannon fodder, and is materially different and far less costly
than a multi-spectrum state-vs-state war of conquest in Ukraine. Russia
isn't capable of the latter.

Despite her historic aspirations, Russia enormously overestimated her
own power in Ukraine. Instead, the Russian experience in Ukraine, while
a humanitarian catastrophe, has demonstrated long term hardware,
personnel, intelligence and training deficiencies, as well as structural
issues including endemic corruption, old school planning, authoritarian
decision-making echochamber, and low troop morale.14 Russia also lacks
the economic base and material power and is increasingly reeling under
sanctions.15 Put simply, [Russia is not going to be the hegemonic
spectre looming over Europe anytime in the near future]{.underline}.
What logically entails, is that the Ukraine invasion is not the first
domino to fall across Europe, meriting a preoccupation with Russian
encroachment, but rather, [Russia is a manageable threat that European
states can increasingly balance on their own]{.underline} collectively.
Europeans are perfectly capable without further investment of American
treasure or promise of American blood, and a primacist grand-strategy
requiring American forward presence.16 The only reason Europe is taking
a backseat is because they are reliant on the unending generosity of
Americans.17 In addition, a much-weakened Russia can also be extremely
volatile, prone to miscalculation and paranoia, which might be
exacerbated by the "chain-ganging" of Western great powers by their
activist junior allies--a very common and observable dynamic especially
seen under the conditions of multipolarity wherein smaller protectorates
and hectoring and sanctimonious allies attempt to drag much larger
benefactors to a great power war. It is a trap the US must judiciously
avoid at all cost. Otherwise the result could well be greater
misunderstanding and an even greater risk of accidental conflict along a
much longer border with NATO. This paradoxical dynamic isn't new in
international relations, the First World War being the most ruinous
example.18

The only development that might reverse an emerging natural equilibrium,
is a Ukrainian counterattack on Crimea or somewhere deep inside Russian
territory, or a major expansion of an alliance which justifies Russia's
historic and entrenched paranoia, such as a renewed push for further
NATO enlargement. A Ukrainian counterattack might result in Russia
pulling the nuclear card. It might also solicit a "rally around the
flag" effect for this otherwise unpopular and deteriorating war. Barring
those, Russian aspiration to be a major revanchist great power in the
European balance is practically over, and Russia's current near total
international isolation in 2022 is comparable to her isolation in 1856
or 1921. Meanwhile Ukraine has managed with conscription and compulsory
male draft to gather an overwhelming number of men willing to defend
their country, and is well supplied with practically unlimited foreign
resources and weaponry, an example to other states in the region.

In that light, [the idea that Finland and Sweden, with significant
military capabilities of their own, need to be in an alliance for
protection against Russian revanchism at a time when Russia's status as
a revanchist great power is itself in question, is fallacious,
especially with Russia facing a quagmire in Ukraine. The]{.underline}
possibility of a Russian invasion and conquest of Finland or Sweden is
nearly non-existent.19

Likewise, it is also paradoxical to argue that Finland and Sweden need
protection, while simultaneously contending that they are uniquely
powerful militaries with deterrence capabilities needed for
strengthening NATO's northern frontier.20 The capabilities that Sweden
and Finland has, including a top-tier airforce, are formidable, but not
novel to NATO. Addition of another approximately two hundred jets will
not significantly alter the combined air power of NATO, which is already
superior to Russia. Sweden and Finland will not bring any new
capabilities that would drastically alter the balance of power in the
region, and other than intelligence sharing, would not add any material
advantage to an already overwhelmingly superior NATO. Given that Swedish
and Finnish conscription forces and reservists only come into play
during a war, and the chance of a war with Russia is negligible, they
are also not adding any significant manpower to NATO. NATO's "enhanced
forward presence" from Poland and the Baltic states, can already cover
and protect the allies in the region, as well as project power in the
Arctic without the need for any new bases in Sweden or Finland.
According to NATO's website, the force projection includes eight
multinational "battlegroups, led by the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany
and the United States respectively, \[which\] are robust and
combat-ready forces," and a "multinational brigade, under Multinational
Division Southeast in Romania" for improved situational awareness and
enhanced readiness.21 The Baltics and the Arctic are challenging
frontiers to defend, and some of the older arguments against NATO
enlargement touched upon it. Russia is considered to have an escalation
dominance in the region, due to sheer manpower it can muster in a full
spectrum war. However, [recent Russian experience in Ukraine, and the
negligible chance of a full spectrum war should ease some of the
concerns about mindless Russian imperial revanchism]{.underline}.
According to a Rand Corp analysis, even though the Baltics are hard to
defend in case of an actual war, [deterring Russia is relatively easy
with a few divisions of forward positioned troops, with the implied
threat that any casualty would trigger a NATO -- Russia war. Newer bases
in Finland and Sweden are unnecessary in that regard for any extended
deterrence in the region]{.underline}.22

"NATO membership would strengthen Finland's security. As a member of
NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance," Finland's
President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said in a joint
statement citing the Russian threat of invasion. "Finland must apply for
NATO membership without delay."1The very same day, The Times of London
reported (albeit, per Ukrainian military sources) that [the Russians
lost an entire battalion with over 50 vehicles, and "as many as 73 T-72
and T-80 tanks, BMP armoured fighting vehicles, armoured tractors, a
tugboat and other equipment]{.underline} were destroyed[," and that
around 1,000 to 1,500 soldiers were killed, while crossing a tactical
bridge]{.underline} in Eastern Ukraine, arguably near Russian
strongholds.2

Threat is a combination of intention, power, proximity and capability.
For that reason, the lackluster performance of Russia in Ukraine, and
corresponding heightened threat perception in Europe, is baffling to
realists. After all, what is the hegemonic threat potential of a great
power across a continent that cannot provide air cover to its massacred
battalions over a pontoon bridge, much less total air supremacy over a
theatre of war? It is a pertinent line of inquiry. Wounded by her own
folly[, Russia remains without any demonstrable hegemonic capabilities
to conquer Ukraine and]{.underline} molest [parts of]{.underline}
Eastern Europe or [the]{.underline} wider [continent]{.underline}.3

### U.S. Won't Send Troops to Finland

#### Expansion will require more forces in Finland that the U.S. won't send

One step for NATO to take is obvious: deploy forces, immediately.
[Unlike during past NATO membership expansions, time is not on the
alliance's side here. If it's too late for pre-planning, then NATO must
quickly move to reposition troops into the alliance's new northeastern
flank.]{.underline} If the NATO allies are not willing to commit new
troops, this could be achieved by repositioning existing forces.
Alternatively, perhaps this is the time for the EU itself, given that
Finland and Sweden are both members, to fully commit to being a security
provider. The EU could fill the gap in force deployments by encouraging
its members to move forces to the Finnish-Russian border, potentially
leveraging NATO's command and control capabilities. Given that the
contributions to the Enhanced Forward Presence are shared in a fairly
equitable fashion among various NATO members, perhaps this approach can
be duplicated in Finland.

However, [under the current structure of NATO, the United States is the
ultimate backstop for]{.underline} such [deployments]{.underline}, [and
it will ultimately fall on Washington to fill in any gaps in forces for
Finland.]{.underline} This is problematic. [Though]{.underline} U.S.
President Joe [Biden and his admin]{.underline}istration [strongly
support Finland's and Sweden]{.underline}'s bids [to join
NATO]{.underline}, [it is unclear tha]{.underline}t the Biden team, or
any future [U.S. admin]{.underline}istration, [is willing to base
sizeable deployments]{.underline} of U.S. forces [on Finnish
territory]{.underline}.

To further complicate matters, forward [deploying troops]{.underline} on
Finnish territory [would not be a short-term commitment]{.underline}.
[Even if the war in Ukraine grinds to a halt, Russia will probably
retain]{.underline} or rebuild its ability to [carry out quick
incursions against its neighbors]{.underline}, which would then include
a Finland within NATO. [Defending Finland will require a
long-term]{.underline} and concrete [plan]{.underline} involving the
deployment of substantial forces. [Such a commitment would not come
without costs, both in terms of budget expenses and the potential
diversion of troops from other theaters]{.underline}.

Additionally, [questions should be asked about how Finland and Sweden
will contribute to the defense of NATO territory beyond their own
borders]{.underline}. Their presence alters NATO's map. Whether that
alteration is a net positive or negative for the alliance depends on
exactly how Sweden's and Finland's forces are used. While they have a
track record of working alongside NATO members in operations outside
NATO territory, will they, for example, assist with the Enhanced Forward
Presence? How exactly will they balance Russian operations in the
Arctic? These questions must be faced in the rush to add Finland and
Sweden to NATO.

### AT: NATO Expansion Reduces U.S. Defense Obligations

#### Adding Sweden and Finland won't reduce U.S. defense commitments -- those exist regardless

EXPANSION FOR FINLAND AND SWEDEN: A DANGEROUS AND UNNECESSARY

For any other military or intelligence needs, bilateral or EU frameworks
are more than sufficient.23 [Sweden and Finland's telecom companies such
as Nokia and Ericsson already can get privileged treatment and American
defense contracts, and provide a bulwark against Chinese dominance in
the domain; a formal alliance isn't necessary]{.underline} or needed
[for that]{.underline}. [The argument that adding more
countries]{.underline} [in the alliance will free up American troops is
also flawed, as]{.underline} historically [that has only led to further
Eastern European reliance]{.underline} and demands [as well as West
European free-riding on the American military.]{.underline} It is simply
ahistorical to contemplate that this particular dynamic would change
with Finland and Sweden within NATO. [Consider that Sweden is not even
in NATO yet, and is already calling for more US naval presence in the
Baltic sea]{.underline}.24 In fact, [Russian force posture towards
Finland and Sweden might change once they joi]{.underline}n NATO, [with
more potential]{.underline} Russian [bases in the Arctic, adding to
further increased demands of American military presence]{.underline}.25
The cost-benefit analysis suggests that [the only material difference
for NATO will be the cost of an additional nearly thousand-mile
frontier, and further chances of]{.underline} miscalculation and
[feeding of Russian paranoia]{.underline} about encirclement, which the
Russian ruling elite will use to further justify their worldview.
