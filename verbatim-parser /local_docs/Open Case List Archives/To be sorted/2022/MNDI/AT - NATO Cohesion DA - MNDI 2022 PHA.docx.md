### No NATO Unity / Cohesion

#### Cohesion fraying now \-\-- Turkey and Hungary blocking NATO priorities

Russian President Vladimir [Putin's attack on Ukraine has
made]{.underline} the West --- in this context, [NATO and
the]{.underline} **[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion ---
[more united than it's been in a long time]{.underline}. [Unfortunately,
**that cohesion is now at risk**]{.underline}, as the Russian invasion
turns into a grinding war of attrition. [To deter Putin from escalating
and to keep him from winning, Western leaders must focus on the two
weakest links in their alliance: Turkey and Hungary]{.underline}.

Recep Tayyip [Erdogan]{.underline}, the president of Turkey --- a member
of NATO but not the EU --- says [he will block the accession of Sweden
and Finland to the]{.underline} transatlantic [alliance unless he's
given a series of unrelated concessions]{.underline}. If he actually
follows through, [he would]{.underline} not only leave both countries
more vulnerable to Russian aggression, but also [render NATO weaker than
it should be in defending its Baltic members]{.underline}.
[Gratuitously, Erdogan is also **increasing tensions with Greece**,
another NATO ally.]{.underline}

Then there's [Hungarian Prime Minister]{.underline} Viktor
[Orban]{.underline}. For weeks, he's [been holding up a sanctions
package that would embargo Russian oil]{.underline}. EU leaders last
week thought they had finally reached a compromise: Only Russian oil
delivered by ship would be banned, whereas the sort arriving via
pipelines would not. That would give landlocked Hungary, as well as the
Czech Republic and Slovakia, more time to adjust their energy
infrastructure.

In a shocking breach of decorum, [Orban]{.underline} then reneged on
even that compromise. Bizarrely, he also [insisted on keeping the
Russian Orthodox Church's Patriarch Kirill --- a staunch backer of Putin
and the war --- off the new sanctions list]{.underline}. The EU gave in
to this demand, too, to get the package passed.

The whole ordeal was an embarrassment, and a rare cause for Putin to be
optimistic. [**In every way he can**, Orban is signaling that he's not
fully behind the West's joint effort to support Ukraine and undermine
Russia]{.underline} --- in effect, that he's not a reliable ally.

So what can be done? A basic design flaw shared by both the EU and NATO
is that neither has a mechanism to eject errant members. That means both
will need to get creative in reining in rogue leaders.

In Erdogan's case, acceding to blackmail shouldn't be an option. The US
should announce that future arms sales to Turkey will be halted until it
comes around on the new accessions. NATO should threaten to suspend
Turkish involvement in military planning and exercises. If the situation
escalates, revisiting the alliance's rules to allow for expulsions
should be on the table.

As for Orban, the EU will need to adopt a similarly hard line. In 2018,
the bloc triggered its treaty's Article 7 against Hungary in a censure
of its subversion of democratic institutions, launching a process that
could in theory strip Budapest of its voting rights in Brussels. In
practice, the measure has been toothless, because it requires unanimous
support. Poland, whose populist government is also the target of an
Article 7 proceeding, always had Hungary's back.

These days, however, Poland is among the member states that are most
hawkishly anti-Putin. And Warsaw is horrified by Orban's obstructionism.
Belatedly, the Poles have come to understand that a strong EU is in
their national interest, not against it. They should therefore persuade
Orban to join the effort to weaken Putin's war machine and strengthen
Ukraine. If he doesn't, the other 26 EU countries --- including Poland
--- should strip Hungary of its votes.

[Holding together the Western alliance has never been easy.]{.underline}
Amid a worsening war on its doorstep, it has rarely seemed more
necessary. [The time for **populist political games** is
over.]{.underline}

#### NATO still facing several obstacles that undermine cohesion \-\-- disagreements over strategic concept and political and military weaknesses

**Lucas, 22 \-\-- nonresident fellow at the Center for European Policy
Analysis** (JUNE 7, 2022, 5:31 AM, Edward, "NATO Is Out of Shape and Out
of Date; With the bloc's unity over Ukraine showing cracks, NATO needs
an overhaul,"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/07/nato-ukraine-russia-war-alliance-reform-geopolitics-military/>,
JMP)

Yet [look a little more closely, and the picture is far less
rosy]{.underline}. [Notwithstanding its apparent unity of purpose since
the start of Russia's war, NATO looks out of shape and out of
date.]{.underline} In the run-up to their summit, [the allies have been
**furiously haggling** over the language in their new strategic concept,
which will frame the alliance's mission for the coming years and will be
unveiled in Madrid]{.underline}. What will it say about Russia? About
China? What sacrifices and risks are the member states really willing to
accept? Are they willing to pool sovereignty in order to streamline
decision-making?

[**Nothing** in recent weeks suggests that these questions will get
clear answers.]{.underline} For starters, [the 30-strong alliance is
unwieldy]{.underline}. [In military terms, **only a handful of members
matter**]{.underline}---above all, the United States---[but in political
terms, even little Luxembourg and Iceland get a voice]{.underline}.
Worse, **[the political divides are huge]{.underline}**. Turkey under
President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan is a semi-authoritarian state that
**flirts with Russia** and fumes at]{.underline} what [it considers
European meddling over human rights]{.underline}. [Hungary]{.underline}
under Prime Minister Viktor Orban [is]{.underline} taking a different
but downward path, fusing wealth and power into a new system of control
at home and [undermining U.S. and European attempts to put pressure on
Russia and China]{.underline}. [Macron's relentless posturing and German
Chancellor]{.underline} Olaf Scholz's [foot-dragging create **constant
obstacles and distractions**]{.underline}. The two leader's weaknesses,
on glorious display since the start of the war, have already enriched
the language: Scholzen is a German neologism for "dither," while
makronic in Polish (and its equivalent in Ukrainian) can be roughly
translated as "vacuous grandstanding while doing nothing."

[Macron and Scholz corrode decision-making with their foibles and thus
place a **big question mark over the alliance's credibility and
cohesion**.]{.underline} [Any threat or provocation from Russia is
unlikely to be clear or conveniently timed.]{.underline} More likely it
will be something deliberately ambiguous, such as a Russian drone that
"accidentally" strays onto the territory of a front-line state and hits
a target. [Some countries would favor a tough response. Others would
fear escalation and want dialogue.]{.underline} Still others would take
the ambiguity as a convenient excuse to do nothing. Would the 30---soon
to be 32---national representatives in the North Atlantic Council, the
alliance's deliberative body, really make a speedy and tough decision on
how to react? More likely, some of them would plead for delay,
diplomacy, and compromise. Those actually facing the possibility of
attack would be far more hawkish, preferring a sharp military
confrontation to even the smallest Russian victory. "Not one inch, not
one soul," a senior military figure from one of the Baltic states,
speaking anonymously, told me. "We have seen what they did in Ukraine."

[The **political weaknesses** are matched by military ones]{.underline}.
By far the most important country in the alliance is the United States.
The U.S. security guarantee to Europe---with its threat of devastating
conventional and, if necessary, nuclear response to any attack---is the
cornerstone of the alliance. "All for one and one for all" sounds fine,
but nobody in the Kremlin will tremble at the thought of Spanish, Dutch,
or Canadian displeasure. Yet the result of this is a colossal dependence
on U.S. capabilities, ranging from ammunition and spare parts (of which
European countries' stockpiles are notoriously skinny) to military
transports that move forces quickly and efficiently over long distances.
[**Even if** Europe's new defense spending plans materialize, they will
not change the fact that only U.S. armed forces can move with the scale
and speed necessary to defend territory from a country like
Russia.]{.underline}

[Conversely, the countries that most need defending---Estonia, Latvia,
and Lithuania---are the least able to bear the burden
themselves.]{.underline} They need advanced weapons, particularly for
air and missile defense, that they cannot afford themselves. The thin
neck of land along the Polish-Lithuanian border, the so-called Suwalki
Gap, is particularly vulnerable to attack from Russia's militarized
Kaliningrad exclave and Belarus, from which Russia attacked Ukraine.
Poland and Lithuania both want a big U.S. military presence---either a
permanent base or a persistent rotation of forces---to safeguard this
strategic chokepoint.

Yet [NATO command structures and planning do not fully reflect the
imbalance of forces between the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and Europe]{.underline}. They rely on the
fiction that the European allies are more or less equal partners. [Even
military lightweights need to have important-sounding jobs and
installations, making the North Atlantic Council the military version of
a parliament dividing out the pork.]{.underline}

[The resulting command structure is like **a tangled pile of
spaghetti**.]{.underline} In the Baltic region alone, NATO has several
multinational headquarters, one divisional headquarterss split between
Latvia and Denmark, another divisional headquarters in Poland, and a
corps headquarters at a different location in Poland. Overall
responsibility for the defense of Europe is divided between three Joint
Forces Command headquarters in Naples, Italy; Brunssum, the Netherlands;
and Norfolk, Virginia. But the top U.S. military commander in Europe,
Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, is based at Supreme Headquarters Allied
Powers Europe in Mons, Belgium. A maritime strategy for the Baltic Sea
region has yet to be decided---which is just as well, because NATO has
yet to create a naval headquarters for the region. Nor has the alliance
drawn up real military plans for the reinforcement and defense of its
northeastern members, let alone decided who would actually provide the
forces and equipment in order to make them credible. Military mobility
is meant to be the responsibility of Joint Support and Enabling Command,
headquartered in Ulm, Germany, and originally set up as part of the
European Union's own defense policy.

[A further problem is exercises: NATO does not conduct fully realistic,
large-scale rehearsals of how it would respond to a Russian
attack.]{.underline} One problem is that these are costly and
disruptive. Another is that they expose the huge weaknesses of some NATO
members, which can cope with a carefully scripted exercise but lack the
ability to improvise. A third reason is the fear, in some countries,
that practicing war-fighting would be provocative. Also lacking are
detailed plans for fighting a war against Russia, covering such issues
as reinforcing of front-line states, countering a Russian attack,
regaining any temporarily occupied territory, and---most of
all---dealing with a nuclear or other escalation. As a result, [nobody
is quite sure how anything would work in a crisis]{.underline}. Instead,
another assumption reigns: that in a crisis, the United States would
take over and do the heavy lifting on all fronts---logistics,
intelligence, and combat.

To be fair, [NATO is working on these problems]{.underline}, and all of
them are fixable. [But that does not mean that they are anywhere near
being fixed. **Wishful thinking** remains the alliance's besetting
sin.]{.underline}

#### NATO not united on Ukraine

**Carpenter 22 -- senior fellow for defense and foreign policy studies
at the Cato Institute** \[Ted Galen, MARCH 23, 2022, CATO institute,

ER\]

[Moscow's aggression]{.underline} also [has triggered a]{.underline}
sense of alarm and a [more serious attitude in multiple European
countries about doing more for NATOs collective defense]{.underline}
mission. That shift has been especially evident in Germany, where
Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government approved an emergency fund to boost
Berlin's military budget by 100 billion Euros. The latter move would
finally fulfill Germany's longstanding pledge (along with all other NATO
members) to spend at least 2 percent of Gross Domestic Product annually
on defense. Berlin had repeatedly procrastinated about carrying out that
commitment. A far more militant posture by the Scholz government also
was apparent when it stated an intent to ship weapons to Ukraine to
bolster that country's military resistance. Previous German governments
would have considered such involvement in a raging war unthinkable.
Numerous other NATO members, including the United States, already are
pouring weapons into Ukraine.

Nevertheless, [it is easy to **overstate the degree of unity** regarding
policy toward Russia even among NATO members]{.underline}, much less
within the broader international community. Indeed, [some **cracks
already are beginning to form**]{.underline} in NATO's solid front.
[When Poland's Vice Premier]{.underline}, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, [suggested
that the Alliance send an armed peacekeeping force to Ukraine to provide
humanitarian aid, the reactions were widely divergent]{.underline}.
Estonian Defense Minister Kalle Laanet said that a proposed peacekeeping
mission was "one of the possibilities" NATO should consider, but
[several]{.underline} other [governments pushed back]{.underline}. We're
"still in too early stages to talk about that," said Dutch Defense
Minister Kajsa Ollongren, adding that such a deployment would need the
backing of the United Nations Security Council---a requirement that made
the plan a nonstarter, since as a permanent member of the Council,
Russia holds veto power.

[**Divisions within NATO** are even **increasingly evident** on the
issue of providing weapons to Ukraine]{.underline}. Addressing a massive
campaign rally on March 15, [Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban,
emphasized that "we must stay out of this war ... therefore we will not
send any troops or weapons]{.underline} to the battlegrounds." A few
days later, Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov stated flatly that his
country will not engage in "hostilities" in Ukraine and that no arms
will be supplied.

#### While US may support aid to Ukraine, there lack of unity and cohesion globally on strategy

**Carpenter 22 -- senior fellow for defense and foreign policy studies
at the Cato Institute** \[Ted Galen, MARCH 23, 2022, CATO institute,
"Just How United Is NATO (and the World) against Russia?"
[https://www.cato.org/commentary/just-how-united-nato-world-against-russia

ER\]

Beyond NATO (and longstanding U.S. allies in East Asia), [the absence of
support for Washington's strategy of imposing harsh penalties on Russia
is glaringly evident]{.underline}. That problem surfaced almost
immediately. On March 2, [the U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations
[General Assembly approved a resolution condemning Russia's invasion of
Ukraine and calling for the immediate withdrawal of Russian military
forces]{.underline}. 141 [countries voted]{.underline} for the
resolution, and [U.S. officials gloated that only 5 voted against
it.]{.underline}

[However]{.underline}, a stunning [35 countries decided to
abstain]{.underline}, [even though a favorable vote to placate the
United States and its allies should have been an easy option, since the
resolution was purely symbolic, not obligating UN members to take
any]{.underline} substantive [action]{.underline}. [Yet a significant
number of countries]{.underline} in Asia, the Greater Middle East, and
Sub‐​Saharan Africa, [opted to snub Washington]{.underline}. When more
than 20 percent of the General Assembly's membership refuses to embrace
a purely feel‐​good measure Washington wants passed, the U.S.-sponsored
global coalition looks fragile indeed.

[It is especially ominous for U.S]{.underline}. objectives
[that]{.underline} both [China and India]{.underline} have remained
[firm in their opposition to imposing economic sanctions on
Russia]{.underline}---as have numerous other countries outside of Europe
and East Asia. Even portions of Latin America have balked at waging an
economic war against Russia. Indeed, beyond Washington's network of
traditional allies, the isolation of Russia appears to be significantly
exaggerated.

Political scientists frequently note that [coalitions tend to be a
**mile wide but only an inch deep**]{.underline}. [That]{.underline}
situation [may well apply to NATO unity regarding policy toward
Russia]{.underline}. When it comes to the rest of the world, any sense
of unity on that issue is not even a half‐​inch deep.

### AT: Consultation Link 

#### Consultations have not been effective in strengthening NATO -- there is no enforcement or obligation

**Lorenz, 20** **\-\-- international security expert at the Polish
Institute of International Affairs** \[Wojciech, November, 2020,
"Strengthening NATO's cohesion through consultation",
<https://icds.ee/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ICDS_Brief_NATO2030_-Series_1_Wojciech_Lorenz_November-2020_cor.pdf>,
accessed 6/23/22, NB\]

The strongest norms and most elaborate mechanisms have been developed
regarding consultations on collective defence policy. Since this is a
primary task of NATO, derived directly from the Washington Treaty, some
experts claim that there might be a legal obligation to consult before a
NATO member takes a definite action, which could undermine the common
defence.4 [There is no mechanism to enforce compliance and there are
**numerous examples** of Allies bypassing consultation to take
unilateral actions.]{.underline} Nevertheless, most Allies try to
respect such a norm as it creates a similar obligation for the US,
limiting the risk, for example, of the unexpected or uncoordinated
withdrawal of US troops from Europe.

There is another important dimension of consultations concerning actions
[outside]{.underline} the [Euro-Atlantic area]{.underline}---since this
is not a 'treaty area' [there is no]{.underline} apparent [legal
obligation to consult.]{.underline} Nevertheless, the European Allies
expected the US to use consultations to inform them about plans that
could affect NATO's security. [The US was also interested in such
consultation]{.underline}s, [expecting]{.underline} that they would
facilitate coordination of NATO policies in [support]{.underline} [of
American foreign policy goals, but this rarely turned out to be the
case]{.underline}. The 1967 Harmel report was an attempt to strengthen
this dimension of consultation and thus NATO's political cohesion,
stating that "the North Atlantic

Treaty Area cannot be treated in isolation from the rest of the world.
Crises and conflicts arising outside the area may impair its security
either directly or by affecting the global balance."5

In 1974, [NATO made]{.underline} another [attempt to strengthen
consultations adopting the Ottawa Declaration]{.underline}, which
stressed that "the Allies are firmly resolved to keep each other fully
informed and to strengthen the practice of frank and timely
consultations by all means which may be appropriate on matters relating
to their common interests as members of the Alliance, bearing in mind
that these interests can be affected by events in other areas of the
world."6

Such [declarations, however, did not solve]{.underline} the structural
problems that discouraged states from consulting to coordinate common
responses to crises outside the treaty area. [Some states blocked such
consultations]{.underline}, believing that the Alliance should not deal
with problems beyond its 'treaty area' and that discussions could lead
to new commitments that would undermine collective defence and
deterrence policy. Bigger states also wanted to preserve their
privileged bilateral relations with the US, which often resulted in
informal consultations in smaller formats. The US did not want to share
sensitive information with all Allies without guarantees that this would
result in coordinated action in support of US foreign policy goals.

#### NATO consultations have not diffused tensions

**Lorenz, 20 \-\-- international security expert at the Polish Institute
of International Affairs** \[Wojciech, November, 2020, "Strengthening
NATO's cohesion through consultation",

accessed 6/23/22, NB\]

[In recent years]{.underline}, [NATO's]{.underline} mechanisms of
[consultation have **proved lacking** in defusing tensions and
discouraging unilateral actions]{.underline}, both [in the Euro-Atlantic
area and beyond]{.underline} it.

During Donald Trump's presidency, [for example, the US withdrew troops
from Syria]{.underline}, despite the possible impact on the security of
the Allies. [This unilateral decision encouraged Turkey to send troops
to Syria, which could further complicate the fight with Islamic
terrorist groups and increase the risk of confrontation between Turkey
and Russia]{.underline}, which has a military presence in Syria. Also,
despite NATO's presence in Afghanistan, the US pursued negotiations with
the Taliban without providing [NATO]{.underline} with an insight into
its plans. And it only [resorted to consultations in NATO on its
decision to withdraw]{.underline} from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces treaty after the criticism from the Allies. Similarly, it first
announced the decision to withdraw troops from Germany and only later
consulted with Allies about how to limit the impact on NATO. [Some of
these decisions were publicly criticised by NATO members]{.underline},
most vocally by French president Emmanuel Macron who, before the 2019
NATO leaders meeting, accused the Alliance of being "brain dead" and
took the opportunity to promote the idea of European 'strategic
autonomy'.9

### Unity Not Key 

#### Unity is not key to helping member states\-\-- disagreements are inevitable and a [built-in benefit]{.underline} 

**Skaluba & Rodhian, 22** \-\-- \*served as principal director for
European and NATO policy in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, AND
\*\*associate director in the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and
Security's Transatlantic Security Initiative (January 18, 2022,

Initiative in the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and

still effective,"
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/no-consensus-no-problem-why-nato-is-still-effective/>,
JMP)

[As the crisis over Ukraine intensifies, key stakeholders are looking to
Brussels for signs of Western resolve.]{.underline} At the NATO-Russia
Council meeting on January 12, the Alliance delivered: In a vivid
expression of solidarity, it categorically (and unanimously) rejected
Russian demands to forgo future expansion or withdraw forces from member
countries.

Yet [as the crisis evolves, decisions about how to support Ukraine will
become more difficult]{.underline}, and [there's a **limit to how
unified NATO can be**]{.underline}. While the West might agree on
introducing tough new economic sanctions and reinforcing the Alliance's
eastern flank, [boosting Kyiv's military capacity]{.underline}---by
supporting an insurgency, for instance, or sending anti-tank
weapons---[will be impossible to achieve by consensus and is much more
likely to come from **individual members than under NATO
auspices**]{.underline}.

This shouldn't be surprising. Consider Russia's annexation of Crimea in
2014 and its ongoing support for separatists in Ukraine's Donbas region:
[NATO actions in support of Kyiv have been more political than
operational, leaving it to individual allies to provide munitions,
equipment, and training to Ukrainian forces]{.underline}. And despite a
recurrent pledge that Ukraine would one day be welcome to join the
Alliance, as well as the sympathy expressed by allies for Ukraine's
plight, there's been precious little progress on this front.

NATO is primarily concerned about defending its members from Russian
aggression---which it is also wary of provoking by supporting the
Ukrainian military.

Yet despite its lack of meaningful military support for Ukraine, the
crisis has been the animating issue on the Alliance's agenda since 2014.
Russia's attacks on Ukraine and its support for separatists have driven
major NATO initiatives on readiness, defense planning, force posture,
intelligence, and technology development, with an eye toward beefing up
the Alliance's northern and eastern flanks and deterring Russia in both
the conventional and sub-threshold realms. As an institution established
to safeguard Europe, it has successfully geared itself to deter the type
of destabilizing Russian belligerence currently on display.

[Critics of the alliance]{.underline} (and even some supporters) [have
interpreted NATO's unwillingness to militarily support
Ukraine]{.underline}---especially during the most significant challenge
to the European security order since the Cold War---[as an indicator of
its declining relevance, timidity, or its divisions. But that
**overstates the importance of political consensus** to NATO's value and
understates its role as an effective and flexible defensive
alliance.]{.underline} This is a role with potentially critical benefits
for Ukraine.

First, [it **sets too high a bar** for an alliance of thirty members
with aligned, but distinct, priorities.]{.underline} **[Unanimity on
every issue is impossible]{.underline}**, let alone one as complex as
military support to Ukraine. [Debate and disagreement]{.underline}, as
it should be for any democratic institution, [are **built-in features of
NATO---not bugs**]{.underline}. In reality, [it's astounding how often
NATO does reach consensus about issues big and small, creating an
**unrealistic expectation** that it always will]{.underline}. **[The
opposite of consensus is not failure.]{.underline}** Suggesting
otherwise turns any debate that doesn't end harmoniously into an
indictment of NATO, playing straight into Russian propaganda.

Second, a belief that [NATO's]{.underline} value is tied primarily to
achieving consensus on every issue misses the more mundane (and
important) ways it supports its allies and partners. Its [affinity for
process]{.underline}---particularly [its ability to build a common
situational understanding]{.underline} among its
members---[is]{.underline} an [invaluable]{.underline} tool. Habits of
consultation and information sharing, buttressed by deep cooperation on
operations, intelligence sharing, defense planning, and
interoperability, create the foundation upon which any consensus is to
be built. [Even in the absence of]{.underline} that [agreement, the
ability to collectively define threats and jointly train to confront
them is immensely valuable in its own right]{.underline}.

Third, [these habits of cooperation give NATO members the flexibility to
act **outside of the Alliance's frameworks**]{.underline}. While NATO
does much by consensus---such as its missions in the Baltic states---the
skills it helps members develop is central to enabling them to form
separate coalitions for action. This happened recently with ample
success in taking on the Islamic State. Such flexibility should be a
point in NATO's favor, not evidence of its ineptitude.

[In the case of military support for Ukraine, policymakers will find
more attractive alternatives for dealing with Moscow's aggression
outside of the auspices of the Alliance.]{.underline} Up to and
including its recent dialogue with Russia, it has taken a host of
consensus actions to support Ukraine---from condemning Kremlin
aggression and standing up for Kyiv politically to reaffirming its
open-door policy with an expectation that Ukraine will eventually become
a member. It might even share intelligence and develop training and
advisory programs for the Ukrainian military.

And [while it won't find a consensus to fight, it could provide the
foundation for certain allies to support Ukrainian forces in ways
consistent with their national priorities **outside of
NATO**]{.underline}. In that case, NATO's enabling value to its members
in complicating Putin's cost-benefit assessment should be applauded.

Last week's NATO-Russia Council meeting showcased an Alliance working in
lockstep and finding political consensus in responding to preposterous
Russian demands. [NATO should always strive for]{.underline} this degree
of [consensus]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} if and [when]{.underline}
this crisis intensifies, and [Putin advances further]{.underline} into
Ukraine, expectations for NATO assistance will be raised, decisions
about how to respond will become more difficult, and [consensus will be
more elusive]{.underline}.

Despite the rhetoric we might hear in response, **[this is not evidence
of NATO's ineffectiveness]{.underline}**---[but]{.underline} rather a
[reflection of how democratic institutions function]{.underline}. And
[**even absent consensus, NATO can still contribute invaluably** to
Ukraine's sovereignty]{.underline}.

### NATO Can't Solve Russia

#### NATO unprepared for Russia's modern warfare

- Weaponizing of hunger

- Campaign of disinformation

**Lucas, 22 \-\-- nonresident fellow at the Center for European Policy
Analysis** (JUNE 7, 2022, 5:31 AM, Edward, "NATO Is Out of Shape and Out
of Date; With the bloc's unity over Ukraine showing cracks, NATO needs
an overhaul,"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/07/nato-ukraine-russia-war-alliance-reform-geopolitics-military/>,
JMP)

Worse, [NATO is unprepared for the changing nature of modern
warfare]{.underline}. [Russia's]{.underline} old-style assault on
Ukraine is all too familiar. But the artillery bombardments and missile
strikes that are grinding down Ukraine's defenses are only part of the
Kremlin's arsenal. Its [most effective weapons are nonmilitary:
subversion, diplomatic divide-and-rule tactics, economic coercion,
corruption, and propaganda.]{.underline} The most burning current
example of nonmilitary warfare is [Russia's weaponizing of
hunger]{.underline}. By blocking Ukraine's grain exports, Russia has
raised the specter of famine over millions of people, including in
volatile and fragile countries in North Africa and the Middle East. Mass
starvation is not just a humanitarian catastrophe, but its consequences
include political unrest and mass migration, a direct threat to Europe.
Yet [**NATO is ill-equipped** to deal with this]{.underline}. It cannot
mandate more economical use of grain---for example, by feeding less to
livestock and stopping grain's conversion to fuel. It has no food
stockpiles to release to a hungry world. It cannot build new railways to
ship Ukrainian grain through other routes. Nor can it insure merchant
vessels that might---for a price---be willing to run Russia's Black Sea
blockade. [NATO has little in-house expertise in countering Russian
disinformation and almost zero influence in African and other countries
susceptible to Kremlin narratives blaming the West for the food
shortages that are already starting now.]{.underline}

NATO could acquire these capabilities. Or it could regain them: During
the Cold War, the alliance had an economic warfare division and ran a
program called the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export
Controls to prevent the Soviet bloc from acquiring sensitive
technologies. But in the strategic timeout that followed the collapse of
the Soviet bloc, these agencies and their skill sets shriveled and died.

But as with NATO's military shortcomings, identifying the problems is
not the same as solving them. And [given the bloc's **unwieldy
structure** and issues with key members, it might be **wise to lower
expectations** about NATO returning to Cold War levels of consistent
readiness and effectiveness]{.underline}. A more realistic vision for
the alliance would be to treat it as a framework for the most capable
and threat-aware members to form coalitions of the willing. These
groupings already exist: The British-led Joint Expeditionary Force, for
example, is a 10-country framework for military cooperation, chiefly
aimed at enabling very rapid deployments to the Nordic-Baltic region in
the event of a crisis. France has a similar venture, the European
Intervention Initiative. The five Nordic states have their own military
club, called the Nordic Defence Cooperation, while Poland has close
bilateral ties with Lithuania. A similar network of bilateral and
multilateral ties would greatly strengthen the alliance's floundering
presence in the Black Sea and other regions, including North Africa and
the Eastern Mediterranean. These groupings would not supplant NATO but
improve action and interoperability on top of the alliance's established
structures and mechanisms.

The difficult and underlying question here is the role of the United
States. Europe is, in theory, big and rich enough to manage its own
defense. But its persistent political weakness prevents that. [The
paradox is that only U.S. involvement makes NATO credible---yet
overdependence on the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [also undermines the alliance's credibility,
while stoking resentment in France and elsewhere. The task for
Washington is to encourage European allies to shoulder more of the
burden and start thinking strategically again, even as it retains the
superpower involvement that gives the alliance its decisive military
edge.]{.underline} That is entirely doable. But [don't expect it to
happen in Madrid---or **anytime soon**]{.underline}.

### Russia Won't Use Nuclear Weapons 

#### Nuclear use unlikely by Putin \-\-- would make him a pariah and alienate Russia from the international community

**Wormuth, 22 \-\-- Secretary of the Army, US Department of Defense**
(June 2, 2022, Christine Wormuth, moderated by Vivian Salama who serves
as a national security reporter at The Wall Street Journal "NATO allies
must not take their unity on Ukraine for granted, says Secretary of the
Army Christine Wormuth,"

JMP)

VIVIAN SALAMA: Before we move on to another subject, just a really blunt
question, being that [there is concern that]{.underline} President
[Putin could resort to nuclear weapons at some stage, especially if he
gets desperate]{.underline} in this conflict. What is the Army's role in
preventing that kind of a scenario, especially absent direct military
involvement in Ukraine?

CHRISTINE WORMUTH: You know, I think what we can do---I mean, first of
all, I think it's important to say that, you know, we are undoubtedly
looking at that type of contingency and trying to think through what our
options---you know, what options would be available to policymakers if
that were to happen? The Army, I think what we can most, you know,
helpfully do is to try to provide training for how to operate under
those kinds of conditions. You know, we have personal protective
equipment and things like that. But I think, you know, [if Putin were to
decide to use some sort of tactical nuclear demonstration]{.underline},
I think, you know, [that would **erase**]{.underline}, in my mind,
[**any possibility** that he could be anything other than a pariah
leader]{.underline} and a---leader of a pariah state, you know, [for
decades]{.underline} going forward. So I think that [Putin would have to
think extremely long and hard about that, since he clearly wants to try
to bring Russia back into the international community at some point. I
don't see how he does that if he goes nuclear.]{.underline}

## Affirmative DA NATO Expansion Answers

### Turkey Will Block NATO Expansion to Sweden / Finland

#### Turkey will NOT let Sweden and Finland join NATO \-\-- won't be persuaded 

**Turak, 22 \-- CNBC correspondent** (5/17/22, Natasha 'The stakes here
are now massive': Turkey is threatening to block NATO membership for
Sweden and Finland.
<https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/17/will-turkey-block-nato-membership-for-sweden-and-finland.html>)
//AB

[Turkish President]{.underline} Recep Tayyip Erdogan has [**doubled
down** on]{.underline} his [opposition to Sweden and Finland
joining]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline} alliance, a move that would
be historic for the two Nordic countries in the wake of [Russia's
invasion of
Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/17/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html).

["We will not say 'yes' to those \[countries\] who apply sanctions to
Turkey to join security organization NATO,"]{.underline} [Erdogan
said]{.underline} at a news conference late Monday. He was [referring to
Sweden's suspension of weapons sales to Turkey]{.underline} in 2019 over
its military activities in Syria.

Sweden's Foreign Ministry said Monday that it planned to send senior
officials joining with officials from Finland to the Turkish capital of
Ankara to address Erdogan's objections. But the Turkish leader
essentially said they'd be wasting their time.

["**Will they come to persuade us?** Excuse us, but **they shouldn't
bother**,"]{.underline} Erdogan said. He added that the two countries
joining would make NATO "a place where representatives of terrorist
organizations are concentrated."

#### Turkey won't vote for membership until Sweden and Finland address Kurdish activists

**Wintour, 22 -- Diplomatic Editor of The Guardian** \[Patrick; 6/14/22;
The Guardian; "Turkey threatens year's delay to Swedish and Finnish
entry to Nato";
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/14/turkey-threatens-years-delay-to-swedish-and-finnish-entry-to-nato>;
accessed 6/18/22; DWC\]

[Turkey]{.underline} has said it is [willing to delay Swedish and
Finnish membership of Nato for **more than a year** unless it receives
satisfactory assurances that the two]{.underline} Nordic countries [are
willing to address support for Kurdish groups it regards as terrorist
organisations]{.underline}.

Finland's prime minister said on Tuesday that the [two nations' Nato
applications could stall if the issue is not resolved]{.underline}
before a vital [Nato summit]{.underline} due to start [in Madrid on 29
June.]{.underline}

[Turkey accuses Sweden and Finland of harbouring alleged members of the
Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK)]{.underline} and also [objects to their
decisions in 2019 to ban arms exports to]{.underline} Ankara due to
Turkey's military operations in Syria.

Turkey has gone on a public diplomacy offensive to highlight [Swedish
support for Kurdish groups]{.underline} in northern Syria that it [links
to the PKK -- designated as a terrorist organisation in the EU, US and
Turkey]{.underline} -- and is planning to stage a fringe meeting on the
issue at the Nato summit.

"This is a matter of vital national interest, and [we are prepared to
prevent their membership for as long as a year if necessary," said Akif
Çağatay Kılıç, an MP for the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP)
and chair of the Turkish parliament's foreign affairs
committee]{.underline}. "[Turkey is the second largest army in
Nato]{.underline} and has been providing the drones that help Ukraine
defend itself. We [deserve greater respect]{.underline}."

He said Turkey respected its own duties and responsibilities to the
alliance. "What are \[Sweden and Finland\] going to do? [They have been
harbouring terrorist organisations that kill my people, disrespect my
borders, pose an existential threat to my country.]{.underline} The only
thing we demand is that there are no distinctions. [A terrorist
organisation is a terrorist organisation."]{.underline}

He [denied the crisis was an attempt to fan nationalist flames before
difficult elections]{.underline}, saying the non-Kurdish opposition
parties were supportive of the stance of the president, Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan. He also said there was no attempt to barter with the US over
arms deals.

During a visit to Sweden on Tuesday, Finland's prime minister, Sanna
Marin, warned: "[If we don't solve these issues before \[the\] Madrid
\[summit]{.underline}\], there is a risk that the [situation will
freeze]{.underline}.

"We don't know for how long but it might freeze [for a
while]{.underline}."

Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, has praised Swedish
efforts to address Turkey's concerns, but seems to have recognised that
[plans for a fast-track membership may now be disappearing.]{.underline}

The Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, is due to attend the
summit, which may end up being a show of division as much as it is
concerned with long-term strategic thinking and enlargement. Privately,
western officials admit that Germany, France and the US are not keen to
have Ukraine dominate the summit, although it is hard to imagine Nato
support for Kyiv not being the central issue.

On Friday Sweden tried to mollify Turkey by publishing a foreign policy
paper that highlighted the need to fight terrorism, and opened a path
for Sweden to resume arms export sales to Turkey. Sweden imposed
restrictions on arms sales in 2019 after Turkey's invasion of northern
Syria. Britain has already lifted the sales ban.

The policy paper said Sweden would "contribute to all of Nato's security
including that of Turkey". A tougher anti-terrorism law, due to come
into force on 1 July, gives the Swedish intelligence services greater
latitude to monitor communications of suspected terrorist sympathisers.

Although [Turkish demands]{.underline} can vary, [officials have said
they want to see specific Kurdish activists deported to Turkey, as well
as the sacking of the Swedish defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, over a
2011 meeting with the PKK, which has been designated as a terrorist
organisation in Sweden since 1984.]{.underline}

Ankara would like the two countries to sever ties with the US-backed
Syrian Kurdish autonomous administration, which Turkey says has a
synonymous leadership to the PKK.

Andersson's room for manoeuvre is limited, in that she is not [going to
transform Swedish extradition laws simply to satisfy the threats coming
from the Turkish president,]{.underline} and last week she had to rely
on the support of a Kurdish Swedish MP and former peshmerga fighter,
Amineh Kakabaveh, to survive a narrow confidence vote. The MP says she
received unspecified guarantees in return for her vote.

[Sweden is home to 100,000 Kurdish refugees.]{.underline}

Turkish diplomats resent suggestions that it did not make its objections
to Swedish membership earlier or that it is being hypocritical about the
Kurdish issue due to its support for extremist groups elsewhere in the
Middle East.

[Finland]{.underline} has fewer problems with Turkey, but has said it is
[unlikely to press ahead with a membership request without
Sweden.]{.underline}

Finnish media reported that the country received 10 Turkey-related
extradition requests between 2019 and 2022. It granted two of those
requests and is processing seven.

While Britain has strong diplomatic ties with Turkey, it has also given
security assurances to the two Nordic countries during the potentially
dangerous grey period between their application to join Nato and the
moment when full membership gives them the alliance's collective defence
protection.

In an effort to find a resolution, the UK's Europe minister, James
Cleverly, is in Turkey this week to meet ministers. Angus Lapsley, the
director for Euro-Atlantic security at the Foreign Office, said the UK
was working night and day to try to resolve the dispute.

Stoltenberg has said the Madrid summit was never a deadline.

#### Turkey is demanding steps by Finland and Sweden before it supports accession

**Tosu, 22 -- Director of International Programs at the University of
Nevada** (6/23/2022, Mehmet, 2022\"Unity, solidarity against common
threats key for NATO, Türkiye tells US,\" No Publication;

DOA: 6-23-2022) SMTX//BSA

[There must be unity, harmony and solidarity among NATO allies against
common security]{.underline} and terrorist [threats]{.underline},
[Türkiye's Presidential spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin said]{.underline} in
a phone call with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on
Thursday.

Along with bilateral political and economic ties, the officials held
discussions on Türkiye's role in NATO and contributions to the alliance,
the upcoming NATO Madrid summit, Sweden and Finland's NATO bids, grain
shipments through the Black Sea and other regional issues, according to
a statement from the Turkish presidential spokesperson.

They exchanged views on issues on the agenda for next week's NATO
summit, including its new Strategic Concept, the Ukraine war, the fight
against terrorism, the global food crisis and other security issues, the
statement said.

[Kalin]{.underline} [emphasized]{.underline} that NATO allies must have
a unified stance against common security and terrorist threats,
reiterating [that Sweden and Finland **must fulfill Türkiye's demands**
and expectations]{.underline} in the fight against terrorism.

Since Sweden and Finland formally applied to join NATO last month,
[Türkiye]{.underline}, a longstanding member of the alliance, [has
repeatedly voiced objections over the countries' tolerance, and even
support, for terrorist groups, particularly the PKK terrorist
organization.]{.underline}

Kalin stressed that **[no progress could be made]{.underline}** on the
matter [**until** Sweden and Finland take concrete steps.]{.underline}

He underlined that [it was unacceptable that PKK]{.underline}/PYD/YPG
[supporters are disseminating propaganda in Stockholm]{.underline} and
through the media while Ankara remains engaged in talks with the two
Nordic countries.

He also conveyed that [Türkiye is continuing negotiations with Ukraine
and Russia on creating a safe corridor for grain shipments through the
Black Sea.]{.underline}

Achieving results from this negotiation process, which includes the UN,
is of strategic importance for global food security, he added.

#### Turkey has several concerns about Sweden and Finland that could [derail]{.underline} or at least [delay]{.underline} accession 

**Ünlühisarcıklı, 22 \-- manager of the Resource Development Department
of the Educational Volunteers Foundation of Turkey** \[5-19-2022, Özgür,
"Erdoğan Will Not Walk Away Empty-Handed,"
<https://www.gmfus.org/news/finland-and-sweden-apply-join-nato-whats-next>,
accessed on 6-18-2022, LKK\]

[Sweden and Finland's decision to apply for NATO membership is welcome
with enthusiasm across the Atlantic, but **Turkey may spoil the
party**.]{.underline}

In an unexpected move, President Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan has announced
that he does not favor the two countries' membership to NATO on the
grounds that they are havens for terrorist organizations targeting
Turkey, specifically the]{.underline} Kurdistan Workers'
Party [(PKK]{.underline}) and its offshoots. Both Sweden and Finland
reject this claim but remain open to discussions with Turkey on the
subject.

[It would be a mistake to dismiss Erdoğan's stance as being motivated by
domestic political considerations alone or to expect him to walk back
empty-handed. **Turkey has real concerns** and will **likely delay** the
upcoming NATO enlargement unless those concerns are addressed by Sweden
and Finland.]{.underline}

[Erdoğan is playing a two-level game here. At the international level,
he aims to further weaken the PKK. In Turkey's view, separatist
terrorism is the single most important security]{.underline} threat and
whether others agree is not relevant for its calculus. [Degrading the
PKK has been, and remains, a priority for every government in Turkey
since the 1980s.]{.underline}

[At the domestic level, he aims to portray himself as a strong leader
who can protect Turkey's interests internationally in a way that his
predecessors could not]{.underline}. According to the [Turkish
Perceptions of the European Union 2021
Survey](https://www.gmfus.org/news/turkish-perceptions-european-union) conducted
by the German Marshall Fund of the United States, [67.9 percent of
Turkish respondents believe that the European countries want to divide
and disintegrate Turkey, just like they did to the Ottoman Empire in the
past.]{.underline} Moreover, 70.1 percent believe that the European
countries have helped strengthen separationist organizations such as the
PKK in Turkey. As such, Erdoğan's criticism toward Sweden and Finland
will easily resonate with the Turkish people.

[It would also be a mistake for Ankara to underestimate the magnitude of
the decision to delay a historical NATO enlargement and the negative
reaction it would face from each and every NATO ally at a time when
Turkey is trying to bridge the gap between itself and its Western
allies.]{.underline}

[Turkish, Swedish, and Finnish diplomats, with support from other
allies, can and should find common ground to address the concerns
regarding]{.underline} the stance of Sweden and Finland [toward the PKK
and ensure that NATO enlargement can proceed without delay.]{.underline}
The accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO is so important, for Turkey
as well, that this problem will likely be resolved through dialogue and
empathy. But it will not go away on its own.

#### Turkey blocks Finland and Sweden from joining NATO

**Coşkun, 22** -- senior fellow at CEIP and former director general for
int-security affairs at the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (June
24, 22; Alper Coşkun; "Turkey and NATO are stronger with each other.
They must de-thorne their relationship";
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/turkeysource/turkey-and-nato-are-stronger-with-each-other-they-must-de-thorn-their-relationship/AI)

As NATO prepares for its summit in Madrid next week[, Turkey is in the
headlines for holding up Finland and Sweden's bids to join the
Alliance]{.underline}---irking not only the two candidate countries, but
also their would-be NATO allies.

[Ankara wants Helsinki and Stockholm to stop harboring and supporting
individuals affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which it
considers to be a terrorist organization]{.underline} (and is recognized
as such by both the United States and the European Union[). It also
demands an end to the arms embargoes imposed by these countries after
Turkey's military operation in northern Syria]{.underline} in 2019.
President Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan has made it clear that **nothing short
of concrete steps** will be enough to reverse Turkey's
stance.]{.underline}

Turkey's concerns are serious and, as stated by NATO Secretary General
Jens Stoltenberg, they are "legitimate." Yet Russia's invasion of
Ukraine and the belated manner in which Ankara has publicly raised its
concerns have muddled that important reality, tainting Turkey and its
role in the Alliance.

#### Turkey will still block Sweden and Finland \-\-- disagreement over PKK issue 

**Alaaldin, 22 -- Nonresident Fellow for Foreign Policy at the Center
for Middle East Policy at Brookings** (Ranj, 2022\"Turkey's threat to
derail Swedish and Finnish NATO accession reraises the Kurdish

6-21-2022) SMTX//BSA

[Turkey's opposition to Sweden and Finland joining]{.underline} the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization [(NATO) in the wake of Russia's war
on Ukraine has elevated the Kurdish question on the international
stage.]{.underline} President Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan is attempting to
capitalize on the urgency of fortifying Western deterrence by increasing
the pressure on the]{.underline} Kurdistan Workers' Party
[(PKK).]{.underline} The insurgent group has fought the Turkish state
for five decades to secure greater rights for Turkey's Kurds but enjoyed
a rapid ascension with the onset of the Syrian civil war and
Washington's 2014 decision to partner with its sister organization to
defeat the Islamic State group (IS).

[The PKK has constituted a major component of Turkey's relationship with
Europe and the United States for decades, and Erdoğan has initiated
several military campaigns into Syria's northeast to suppress
the]{.underline} autonomous enclave the [PKK's sister organization, the
Peoples' Protection Units (YPG]{.underline}), formed in the midst of the
civil war. While [Turkey]{.underline} may be using the Nordic NATO
accession talks to receive Western backing for another campaign, it [has
a long record of carrying out cross-border incursions against the
PKK]{.underline} and Erdoğan may also be trying to secure other
concessions, including the lifting of embargoes on Turkey's defense
industry.

But [Ankara's opposition to Swedish and Finnish accession]{.underline},
based on their refusal to extradite PKK members, as well as followers of
the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen (whom Ankara accuses of instigating a
2016 coup attempt), [highlights that the Kurdish question cannot be
decoupled from Western security interests.]{.underline} The tectonic
shifts that have taken place in the global security order since Russia
invaded Ukraine means that the second-order effects of the war against
IS and [the proximity of the Kurdish question to U.S. and European
security interests requires a reprioritization of the issue in the
West.]{.underline}

[Turkey's conflict with the PKK has long complicated Turkey's relations
with the U.S.]{.underline} and its European allies. Relations have been
in flux and either enhanced or upended by shifting fault lines in the
Middle East since the 2011 Arab uprisings and the emergence of IS.
Although [the 2013 peace process between the Turkish state and the
PKK]{.underline} raised hopes of a lasting settlement, the fragile truce
[was upended in 2015]{.underline} by the YPG's ascension in Syria, its
refusal to prioritize the fall of the Assad regime, and deep-seated
animosities. [The result was a renewal of a domestic
conflict]{.underline} that has taken on multiple transnational
dimensions [and produced untold humanitarian crises.]{.underline}

[Ankara has for decades questioned Europe's commitment to addressing its
security concerns.]{.underline} In the 1990s, [Greece and Italy provided
refuge to the PKK's imprisoned founder and leader]{.underline}, Abdullah
Öcalan, and [the PKK established an expansive
infrastructure]{.underline}, including [in Sweden]{.underline}, [that
allows it to mobilize supporters]{.underline} and resources in Europe
and in Turkey. [European leaders had hoped to leverage Turkey's EU
accession process to improve Turkey's human rights records]{.underline}
[but]{.underline} talks stagnated more than a decade ago and [both sides
have effectively given up on it.]{.underline}

[Similarly]{.underline}, in addition to supporting the YPG, [the U.S.
has provoked Erdoğan's ire by refusing to extradite the
Pennsylvania-based Gülen]{.underline}, [while Washington also imposed
tariffs on Turkish steel]{.underline} and aluminium [after an
agreement]{.underline} to release pastor Andrew Brunson [fell through in
2018]{.underline}. [Ankara]{.underline} did U.S.-Turkey relations no
favours by [purchasing Russian air defense systems, after which
Washington imposed sanctions]{.underline} on Turkey.

[Turkey's relations with the West will continue to be crisis-driven amid
a range of ongoing tensions]{.underline}, including over the conflict in
Libya, the eastern Mediterranean crisis, tensions with the EU over the
future of 3 million Syrian refugees in Turkey, and NATO expansion in
response to Russia's aggression. Putting Turkish responsibility for the
current state of affairs to one side, the trans-Atlantic alliance is
guilty of failing to establish forward-looking approaches to tumult in
Turkey's Middle Eastern neighborhood, opting instead for incoherent and
reactive engagement that has put issues like the PKK conflict and
broader Kurdish political questions on the back burner.

The failure to mitigate the second-order effects of policies designed to
address security threats like IS has allowed Ankara to exploit the
West's failure to balance the imperative of securing the defeat of the
jihadis with the need to manage the security interests of regional
actors like Turkey. This has had serious strategic implications, as
evidenced by the current dispute over NATO membership and the pressure
NATO has faced as a result of the ebb in relations and disputes over the
YPG's dominance in Syria.

### U.S.-Turkey Relations Low

#### U.S.-Turkey relations are low now \-\-- erodes consensus building

#### Coşkun, 22 -- senior fellow at CEIP and former director general for int-security affairs at the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs **(June 24, 22; Alper Coşkun; "Turkey and NATO are stronger with each other. They must de-thorne their relationship"; https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/turkeysource/turkey-and-nato-are-stronger-with-each-other-they-must-de-thorn-their-relationship/, AI)**

Restoring the balance

But [**serious thorns remain in Turkey's relations** with certain
allies, and the estrangement risks undermining NATO's resilience at a
critical juncture.]{.underline}

For one, [Turkey is **deeply irritated** that the United States and
others are partnering with the People's Protection Units]{.underline}
(YPG), [the Syrian branch of the PKK, in the fight against the Islamic
State. It is also frustrated at the imposition of arms embargoes---or
covert restrictions on arms sales]{.underline}---by its allies over
issues like Ankara's purchase of Russian-made S-400 air-defense systems,
its Syria policy, and its support for Azerbaijan in the 2020 war against
Armenia. [These differences have led to a **mutual erosion of trust**
between Turkey and its allies, sometimes making consensus-building on
critical matters difficult.]{.underline}

[The Syria issue has, over time, become the most harmful one, pushing
Turkey to the extreme on a matter it considers to be of existential
nature: fighting terrorism.]{.underline} The first public manifestation
of this deepening discord came before NATO leaders met in London in
2019---where Turkey held out until the last minute before begrudgingly
endorsing Poland's and the Baltic states' defense plans. Ankara was
reacting to a hold that had previously been placed on its own defense
plans at the behest of the United States, rooted in disagreement about
how to refer to the YPG.

### Congress Will Delay NATO Expansion 

#### Senate will delay approval for expansion \-\-- could take several months

**Auerswald 22 -- Professor of Security Studies at the U.S. National War
College** \[David Auerswald, May 17, 2022, "How the US Senate could slow
down Sweden and Finland's NATO future"
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/how-the-us-senate-could-slow-down-sweden-and-finlands-nato-future/
Acc 6/21/22 ER\]

[If history is any guide, the Senate will overwhelmingly support adding
Finland and Sweden to NATO]{.underline} (certainly by more than the
two-thirds required by the Constitution). [That was the case in
1998]{.underline}, when senators supported membership for the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and Poland [by an 80-19 vote]{.underline}; in
[2003,]{.underline} when senators unanimously welcomed Bulgaria,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia [by a 96-0
vote]{.underline}; in [2008]{.underline}, when senators admitted Albania
and Croatia [by voice vote]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} in
[2017]{.underline} and [2019]{.underline}, when it approved Montenegro
and Northern Macedonia, respectively, to join the Alliance [with only
two dissenting votes each time]{.underline}.

[The more interesting question is **how long it will take the Senate**
to provide its advice and consent]{.underline}---and here the record
does not bode well. [The amended treaty is likely to be signed in the
next few weeks, perhaps even before the NATO Summit]{.underline} at the
end of June. [That means the Senate]{.underline}, which is typically in
recess during August, [would need to hold hearings and vote in June and
July, September and October, or wait until a lame duck
session]{.underline} after the midterm elections. [The fastest
enlargement process, in 2003, took a month and a half from the NATO
signing ceremony to final Senate passage]{.underline}. [Other rounds
took much longer]{.underline}: The 1998 round took more than four
months, while the 2017 and 2019 enlargements took more than ten and
eight months, respectively. [The war in Ukraine could certainly speed up
the process, but **do not be surprised if the Senate process drags into
the fall**.]{.underline}

Another [question is whether senators will condition their votes on
changes in administration policy]{.underline}. In 1997, for example,
Republican Sen. Jesse Helms withheld support for the Chemical Weapons
Convention until the Clinton administration agreed to abolish the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency and the US Information Agency.

[Senators can also use more subtle means to change policy]{.underline}.
In [providing]{.underline} treaty advice and consent, senators pass what
is called [a ratification document that affirms that Washington will
abide by the treaty's terms]{.underline}. [Senators can add]{.underline}
all sorts [of reservations, understandings, and conditions to that
document]{.underline}. For example, senators have specified that
arms-control treaties do not limit US missile-defense capabilities.

[Nothing in the Constitution or US law requires]{.underline} that
[these]{.underline} reservations, understandings, or conditions [be
limited to the treaty itself]{.underline}. [That means senators can add
clauses requiring executive-branch reports to Congress on unrelated
foreign-policy issues, prohibitions on certain kinds of executive-branch
behavior, or administration acceptance of a senator's foreign-policy
initiative]{.underline}. For instance, senators included provisions on
Nazi war crimes and unrelated prisoner-of-war issues in the 1998 NATO
enlargement document. And a document addressing the 1988
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty specified the allowable
parameters of future conventional arms control and human-rights
agreements with the Soviet Union.

[The record demonstrates that the chamber is more likely to add (perhaps
unrelated) conditions to treaties dealing with important security issues
such as NATO membership when the United States lacks a foreign-policy
consensus]{.underline}, or when it is facing few international threats.
Given the war in Ukraine, expanding NATO would seem to qualify as an
important issue and one on which there is near-consensus on the Russian
threat and NATO's role in deterring it. This suggests that we will see
conditions added to the NATO enlargement ratification document, but not
the dozens that have been added to other security treaties. The fewer
the conditions, the faster will be the Senate debate.

Still, [ultra-partisan senators tend to insert non-germane conditions
and significant reporting requirements on any number of issues into
treaty ratification documents]{.underline}---something we can expect
from today's polarized Senate. [That slows the process]{.underline}.

[The Senate debate over NATO's enlargement is likely to yield a positive
result. But the question is how long that debate will take and what
conditions senators may levy on the administration in exchange for their
votes]{.underline}.

[It is not in the national interest of the United States, through NATO,
to commit to defend two wealthy European welfare states]{.underline}
whose neutrality has kept them safe and prosperous for more than 70
years. While some insist Russia's invasion of Ukraine changes
everything, the fact remains that [new security guarantees will force
trade-offs, consume more resources, and increase the likelihood of a
**confrontation with a nuclear-armed adversary**]{.underline}.

Despite rhetoric from NATO evangelists that can often give the contrary
impression, [adding Finland and Sweden to NATO will lead to increased
costs for the U.S.]{.underline}

Admitting [both nations]{.underline} to NATO could [generate up-front
expenses of over \$8 billion along with \$1.5 billion in additional
annual costs.]{.underline} And while [U.S. military leaders]{.underline}
are currently claiming that their membership in NATO won't lead to a
permanent stationing of troops in either nation, they do [admit that
more U.S. troops will likely rotate to both Finland and Sweden on a more
frequent basis.]{.underline} This [will place further strain on a U.S.
military]{.underline} that is [already struggling to sustain
deployments]{.underline} in support of dozens of ongoing operations
[including active combat missions in Iraq, Syria, and
Somalia.]{.underline}

One [frequent]{.underline}ly cited [justification]{.underline} for
admitting Finland and Sweden to NATO [is that they have capable
militaries that would enhance NATO.]{.underline} However, the [reality
is]{.underline} that [both countries have relatively small professional
militaries]{.underline} of around 20,000 troops each [that rely on large
reserve forces]{.underline} in a time of war [and]{.underline} which
[lack long-range force projection capabilities]{.underline}.
[Sweden]{.underline} is [already requesting a larger U.S. naval presence
in the Baltic Sea]{.underline}, calling into [question the ability of
their military to secure their own backyard.]{.underline}

Additionally, [neither country]{.underline} currently [meets the 2
percent of GDP defense spending goal]{.underline} that was agreed to by
NATO members. [Just as in other parts of Europe]{.underline}, a
[security guarantee provided by the United States]{.underline} could
[encourage free-riding and disincentivize increased investment in
defense capabilities]{.underline} in favor of more spending on
politically popular social programs.

But most dangerously, adding Finland and Sweden to NATO will increase
the risk of a nuclear confrontation with Russia. As a result of its
failures in Ukraine, the threat posed by Russia's conventional forces
has been reduced. But Russia still possesses a large nuclear arsenal
that, according to the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, they
will likely rely on more to secure their borders --- including the
nearly 850-mile one they share with Finland. NATO membership for Finland
and Sweden includes extending the umbrella of America's nuclear
deterrent to both nations, thus elevating the risk that any border
dispute could escalate into a nuclear exchange.

Instead of enabling NATO accession for Finland and Sweden, the United
States should take actions to encourage the strengthening and
development of non-NATO security architectures in Europe like the Nordic
Defence Cooperation, which Finland and Sweden are already a part of. The
failures of Russia's military in Ukraine have demonstrated that
collectively Europe is more than capable of securing itself without
significant U.S. support, as long they properly prioritize defense
investments.

At a time of [record inflation and a \$30.5 trillion national
debt]{.underline}, it is [hard to justify spending more American tax
dollars]{.underline} and [committing]{.underline} more [American troops
to defend two wealthy European social democracies.]{.underline}

This is particularly true when [neither state enhances U.S. security and
both have benefited from neutrality for decades]{.underline}. The lack
of robust debate around this important topic and the smearing of those
who dare to question the benefits of NATO expansion only [raises the
risk that]{.underline} the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
will become [overextended]{.underline}, or worse, potentially
[sleep-walk into a war with a nuclear-armed Russia.]{.underline}

After decades of foreign policy failures that have cost the United
States dearly, America's elected officials owe the American people
better than more costly security commitments disconnected from our
safety and economic prosperity.

Consider also the question of the defensibility of new NATO territory.
Admitting Sweden could be strategically beneficial, allowing NATO forces
to better control the Baltic Sea and to use Gotland Island, at an
important chokepoint off the Baltic States, as a staging ground for any
future conflict.

[Finnish territory]{.underline}, in contrast, [is a strategic
nightmare]{.underline}. [It would **dramatically increase** the
alliance's exposure to any future attacks by Moscow]{.underline}: [the
country shares an 800-mile border with Russia that]{.underline}, as a
recent study from the Center for Strategic and International Studies put
it, [is "highly exposed to Russian military threats."]{.underline}

There are grab bag of other reasons for caution, including the usual
concerns about expanding the alliance to an ever-more unwieldy set of
member states. It doesn't take a genius to predict that 32 nations will
be even harder to manage than 30. Before its Ukraine moment, NATO was
struggling to maintain the peace between Greece and Turkey, few nations
were meeting the 2% spending goal, and President Emmanuel Macron of
France had drawn headlines for suggesting the alliance was experiencing
"brain death."

Even in the face of Russia's aggression, support for adding the two
members isn't unanimous. Turkey's vehement opposition to Finland and
Sweden may be an attempt to wring political concessions from the
alliance, but also owes a lot to these countries' support for Kurdish
causes.

Alliance [leaders should]{.underline} also [consider the risk of
**Russian overreaction**]{.underline}. [Moscow has **started three wars
over potential NATO expansion**]{.underline} --- invading
[Georgia]{.underline} in 2008 and [Crimea]{.underline} in 2014 before
[the current war]{.underline}. While Moscow is clearly not able to stage
another major military campaign right now[, one cannot rule
out]{.underline} President Vladimir [Putin doing something irrational in
response to a NATO expansion that takes the alliance within 200 miles of
his birthplace of St. Petersburg]{.underline}.

At the same time, [it's not clear that Finland and Sweden are at
increased risk **unless they are allowed NATO membership**. They have
long relied on their neutral status and domestic defense capacity to
prevent crises. Refusing to admit them to NATO is not hanging them out
to dry, but simply **retaining a workable status quo**.]{.underline}

The symbolic value of admitting two new member states as the price for
Russia's brutality in Ukraine may carry the day in Brussels. But before
proceeding further with the accession process --- which offers leaders
and legislatures in each member state a chance to weigh in --- policy
makers should consider the whole strategic picture, and whether
admission strengthens the alliance or not.

[Article 10 of the]{.underline} North Atlantic [Treaty makes clear that
existing members may invite new states to join if they "contribute to
the security of the North Atlantic area." By that standard, the
strategic case for admitting Sweden and Finland to NATO is **not a
slam-dunk**.]{.underline}

One of the ironies of Russia's war against Ukraine --- ostensibly fought
to prevent that nation from joining the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization --- has been its impact on two of Europe's traditionally
neutral states, Finland and Sweden. On May 18, just 84 days after the
invasion, Swedish and Finnish ambassadors handed over applications to
join NATO in a public ceremony at the alliance's headquarters in
Brussels.

"This is a historic moment which we must seize," said Secretary-General
Jens Stoltenberg. "You are our closest partners, and your membership in
NATO will increase our shared security." It seems likely that their
applications will be swiftly approved, and NATO will soon grow to a 32
member states.

Yet in the rush to give Putin a black eye by embracing Finland and
Sweden, US and NATO leaders may be failing to consider the potential
costs of inducting two more countries into what, after all, is intended
to be a collective defense organization.

[There are only two clear-cut benefits to bringing in the two Nordic
nations. The first is symbolic]{.underline}: providing a clear
demonstration of European and democratic solidarity against Russian
aggression in Eastern Europe. [The second is technical: Admitting
Finland and Sweden would better align the membership of NATO with that
of the EU]{.underline}, avoiding the unlikely but problematic scenario
in which an EU member state is subject to aggression but is not covered
by NATO's Article 5 mutual-defense pact.

[In **every other respect**]{.underline}, however, [the
question]{.underline} of Finnish and Swedish membership [is more
complicated and worrisome]{.underline}. Consider overall European
defense capacity.

Yes, Finland and Sweden have highly advanced economies. They could be
net contributors to NATO's technological capabilities through national
champions like Ericsson AB and Nokia Oyj. They are also more capable
militarily than some other European states --- particularly Finland,
which has maintained conscription into the post-Cold War period and has
a relatively wide range of military competencies, including the
continent's largest artillery force.

Yet from [the point of view of existing NATO members]{.underline} ---
and [particularly the US]{.underline} --- [it's still not necessarily a
net win]{.underline}. [Finland and Sweden have long focused their
militaries on defending their own territories, **raising doubts** about
their value in contributing to a common defense, which is at the heart
of NATO's charter.]{.underline}

And [while both nations have pledged to increase their military
spending]{.underline} and ability to bolster Europe's broader defenses,
[it is also possible that they would not. Instead]{.underline}, they may
**[free-ride on America]{.underline}**'s military strength --- and its
nuclear umbrella --- [as so many European states have done for
years]{.underline}. According to the International Monetary Fund,
neither country comes close to meeting the NATO goal of spending 2% of
GDP on defense.

[History suggests the most likely outcome is two more states **adding to
America's defense burden** at a time when **Washington should be
pivoting to Asia**.]{.underline}

### NATO Expansion Undermines European Cooperative Defense

America's strategic interest in the European balance is not under any
significant threat from a potential hegemonic challenge that seeks to
dominate the entirety of European landmass under one army and one
flag.26 During the early years of the Republic, American grand strategy
in Europe was one of cautious detachment and non-interference in the
imperial affairs of the European great powers. [After the fall of the
traditional historic balancer of Europe]{.underline}, the British
empire, and facing two world wars and hegemonic threats to security from
Imperial, and subsequently Nazi Germany, [American strategy evolved to
one that mirrored the historic British grand-strategy of "offshore
balancing," that ensured that America would intervene whenever there was
a hegemonic threat in the European horizon]{.underline}. To that end,
the interests of the United States, much like the British empire before
her, is to ensure a militarily disunited Europe, and maintain open trade
and sea routes.

The difference in this instance was that the British aspired to attain
this objective through a delicate "balance of power" within the
continent with minimal interference to tilt the balance as and when
required, while cautiously avoiding continuous engagement in the
domestic affairs of European countries, or commitments about spreading
rights and values. [While the American interest in ensuring no hegemonic
threat in the European continent remained intact, the American
grand-strategy]{.underline}, especially after the collapse of the Soviet
Union, [deviated from an earlier realist one]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline} in turn [sought]{.underline} [to institutionalise peace
across the continent, while ensuring fundamental human rights in every
corner]{.underline} -- or in the words of John Mearsheimer and Barry
Posen, ensure primacy and spread "liberal hegemony."

[Unfortunately, that resulted in the atrophy of Europe's traditional
security providers]{.underline}--the western powers--and at the same
time, encouraged free riding on American treasure and muscle. [The
institutionalisation of peace, first through an expansion of
NATO]{.underline} and then through support of the EU, also [resulted in
buckpassing wherein Western European great powers are perfectly content
to wave the EU flag but simultaneously rely on the US tax-funded
security subsidies]{.underline}. The [Eastern European
powers]{.underline} are permanently activist with lofty rhetoric about
values and human rights, meanwhile leaving the security burden in large
part to be covered by the US. [Both Western]{.underline} European states
[and]{.underline} the [Eastern European states act rationally based on
their narrow security interests, and that is perfectly understandable.
The narrow American interest is the only one ignored in this
context]{.underline}.

[Several American presidents and policymakers]{.underline}, from Dwight
Eisenhower to John Kennedy to Donald Trump, [have attempted to grapple
with European free-riding]{.underline} and "buckpassing."27 [Various
attempts were made either through implicit warnings]{.underline} (such
as Bob Gates' final speech to NATO in 2011) [or explicit
threats]{.underline} (under the Trump Administration) [to
encourage]{.underline} or compel [Western European powers to shoulder
more security burden]{.underline} and provide security umbrella to
theatres in Eastern Europe.28

[Further enlargement of NATO in the current scenario risks doubling down
on American security commitments]{.underline}. [That, coupled
with]{.underline} [unlimited financial aid for Ukraine]{.underline}, or
further permanent troop additions in theatres of Eastern Europe,
[reverses all the recent gains that were made to require Europe to fund
more of its own security]{.underline} requirements. [In the face of
renewed Russian aggression, a one-time US infusion of resources and
weaponry to Ukraine may have been understandable, as were enhanced
bilateral alignments with Finland and Sweden]{.underline}. However[,
those efforts should have been accompanied by]{.underline} corresponding
[requirements]{.underline} [that]{.underline} rich [European states
shoulder the long-term localized security]{.underline} architecture and
endure the majority of the future cost. This is especially so [given
that a localized war]{.underline} in the periphery of their continent
[is of far more strategic significance to Europeans, than it is to the
United States.]{.underline} As the accompanying chart demonstrates, it
is not justifiable to American taxpayers that Europe is once again
subsidized by the US.

Instead, the Biden administration is absolutely determined to double
down on the failures of the post-Cold-war strategy in supporting the
addition of Finland and Sweden to NATO[. The shift of NATO frontiers
further to the east and north, and adding more buffer states, would only
disincentivize rich Western European nations from providing security in
their own backyard]{.underline}. With the rising threat of a near-peer
rival in China, severe economic downturn, and looming strategic
trade-offs, committing more to NATO is irresponsible and imprudent.

Within ten weeks, Finland's eight decades-long equidistance, and
Sweden's two centuries long neutrality were jettisoned, in favor of
unprecedented levels of military bloc formations and foreign military
power support pledges, most notably from fellow Scandinavian nations:
Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and a post-Brexit Britain.5 Having rejected
their historic neutrality, Finland and Sweden have now made formal
applications to NATO membership. However, [the new desire for NATO
membership should not be construed as revealing a lack of current
defenses]{.underline} or alertness [towards]{.underline} the danger
posed by [Russia]{.underline}.

[The existing force postures of Finland and Sweden are **uniquely
designed to deter Russia unilaterally**.]{.underline} The Finnish force
of 280,000 is augmented by around 900,000 reservists who are trained for
wartime.6 Finland never abolished conscription, so [the Finnish
population is functionally ready for wartime service at a moment's
notice]{.underline}. [Finnish "Comprehensive Security" stresses training
to balance Russian hybrid warfare]{.underline}, with intelligence
exchange, interoperability, and training with Western forces.7 [Finnish
strategy]{.underline} of insurgency as a deterrence tactic to blunt
massive occupation forces [is designed with Russia in mind]{.underline}.
Finnish [defence spending is roughly 2% of GDP and certain to
increase]{.underline}.8 [Finland is thus well positioned]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} blunt and [deter]{.underline} any [Russian invasion on
its own]{.underline} and is almost certain to have major western support
in arms and resources in case of a war, even without NATO membership, as
Ukraine has enjoyed.

[Sweden]{.underline} saw major cuts in defense spending and manpower in
the immediate post-Cold War era similar to other major powers, but
[brought back conscription in 2017,]{.underline} after some deliberation
[following the Russian annexation of Crimea]{.underline} in 2014.9
[Sweden]{.underline} boasted of mass conscription during the Cold War
and [had one of the largest trained militarie]{.underline}s, which were
downsized as the Soviet threat receded[. Sweden is also fortunate to
have]{.underline} the Baltic states and Finland as [buffer states from a
direct Russian land invasion]{.underline}. [In recent days]{.underline}
however[, Sweden increased its draf]{.underline}t by 4,000 soldiers per
year and reinstated a garrison on a dormant but strategic island base in
Visby, Gotland. [Overall, both Sweden and Finland have been and arguably
are capable of deterring a Russian push for conquest]{.underline}.10

The Case Against NATO Expansion:

In a recent open survey of Euro-Atlantic foreign policy experts, a
question was posed about whether Finnish and Swedish memberships are
useful for NATO. The answers ranged from "no doubt," to "certainly," and
"definitely," to "straight yes" and "enormously so," before reaching the
broad consensus that the accession of Finland and Sweden would
"strengthen the alliance's defenses and greatly increase security in the
Baltic region." There was not a single voice of dissent.11 While this
might be exemplary of a typical selection bias in such quarters, and
design flaw in open question surveys, the Atlanticist foreign policy
community has been overwhelmingly supportive of adding further
commitments and members in the alliance. This is symptomatic of the long
generational and ideological shift in foreign policy thinking in
Washington, from serious scholarly opposition to NATO's first round of
expansion during the Clinton administration, to an overwhelming support
in recent days.12

Support for Finnish and Swedish membership can be categorized into three
broad arguments.13 First, that Russia's invasion of Ukraine unleashed an
intense "security dilemma" and the smaller states who now feel
threatened should be immediately added as protectorates and the western
(primarily American) nuclear umbrella extended. Second, Sweden and
Finland are already de facto part of the Western alliance, through
either regional cooperative frameworks such as the Nordic Defense
Cooperation and Joint Expeditionary Force, or collaborations within the
EU framework and partnerships with NATO. Third, Sweden and Finland
already have strong militaries and countries with democratic
foundations, and both bring unique deterrence capabilities and
strengthen NATO's northern flank which will make NATO stronger. These
arguments are contradictory, often paradoxical, and strategically
flawed.

[The]{.underline} first line of [argument]{.underline} -- [that the
Russian threat has morphed to now require NATO protection -- is
predicated on Sweden and Finland's threat perceptions]{.underline}.
While Russia's revanchism in Ukraine is clear, the fundamental security
dynamic has not changed. At the time of this brief[, Russia is suffering
from enormous and potentially unbridgeable battlefield setbacks. The
Russian dash to Kiev failed, and Moscow is seemingly unable to
compensate battlefield attrition]{.underline}, including an overwhelming
number of officer class attrition, unthinkable for any other top-tier
military and unseen in any other recent conflicts. The Russian
battlegroups are not in full operational strength. Russia is unable to
fill the gaps created by casualties, troop morale is low, and around a
fifth of Russian invasion force hardware have been destroyed. In short,
[Russia is in no position to continue a "war of conquest," much less a
war of occupation or attrition,]{.underline} without declaring a "total
war" that requires vast levels of domestic conscription, which is of
course, politically unpopular and potentially volatile for Vladimir
Putin. While there have been some indications of a willingness to
broaden the Russian military base, it is certainly not in the interests
of Western policymakers to incentivize such a development. The
much-vaunted Russian military reforms quite clearly did not materialize.
The Russian-backed air war over Syria was dependent on Syrian regime
troops as cannon fodder, and is materially different and far less costly
than a multi-spectrum state-vs-state war of conquest in Ukraine. Russia
isn't capable of the latter.

Despite her historic aspirations, Russia enormously overestimated her
own power in Ukraine. Instead, the Russian experience in Ukraine, while
a humanitarian catastrophe, has demonstrated long term hardware,
personnel, intelligence and training deficiencies, as well as structural
issues including endemic corruption, old school planning, authoritarian
decision-making echochamber, and low troop morale.14 Russia also lacks
the economic base and material power and is increasingly reeling under
sanctions.15 Put simply, [Russia is not going to be the hegemonic
spectre looming over Europe anytime in the near future]{.underline}.
What logically entails, is that the Ukraine invasion is not the first
domino to fall across Europe, meriting a preoccupation with Russian
encroachment, but rather, [Russia is a manageable threat that European
states can increasingly balance on their own]{.underline} collectively.
Europeans are perfectly capable without further investment of American
treasure or promise of American blood, and a primacist grand-strategy
requiring American forward presence.16 The only reason Europe is taking
a backseat is because they are reliant on the unending generosity of
Americans.17 In addition, a much-weakened Russia can also be extremely
volatile, prone to miscalculation and paranoia, which might be
exacerbated by the "chain-ganging" of Western great powers by their
activist junior allies--a very common and observable dynamic especially
seen under the conditions of multipolarity wherein smaller protectorates
and hectoring and sanctimonious allies attempt to drag much larger
benefactors to a great power war. It is a trap the US must judiciously
avoid at all cost. Otherwise the result could well be greater
misunderstanding and an even greater risk of accidental conflict along a
much longer border with NATO. This paradoxical dynamic isn't new in
international relations, the First World War being the most ruinous
example.18

The only development that might reverse an emerging natural equilibrium,
is a Ukrainian counterattack on Crimea or somewhere deep inside Russian
territory, or a major expansion of an alliance which justifies Russia's
historic and entrenched paranoia, such as a renewed push for further
NATO enlargement. A Ukrainian counterattack might result in Russia
pulling the nuclear card. It might also solicit a "rally around the
flag" effect for this otherwise unpopular and deteriorating war. Barring
those, Russian aspiration to be a major revanchist great power in the
European balance is practically over, and Russia's current near total
international isolation in 2022 is comparable to her isolation in 1856
or 1921. Meanwhile Ukraine has managed with conscription and compulsory
male draft to gather an overwhelming number of men willing to defend
their country, and is well supplied with practically unlimited foreign
resources and weaponry, an example to other states in the region.

In that light, [the idea that Finland and Sweden, with significant
military capabilities of their own, need to be in an alliance for
protection against Russian revanchism at a time when Russia's status as
a revanchist great power is itself in question, is fallacious,
especially with Russia facing a quagmire in Ukraine. The]{.underline}
possibility of a Russian invasion and conquest of Finland or Sweden is
nearly non-existent.19

Likewise, it is also paradoxical to argue that Finland and Sweden need
protection, while simultaneously contending that they are uniquely
powerful militaries with deterrence capabilities needed for
strengthening NATO's northern frontier.20 The capabilities that Sweden
and Finland has, including a top-tier airforce, are formidable, but not
novel to NATO. Addition of another approximately two hundred jets will
not significantly alter the combined air power of NATO, which is already
superior to Russia. Sweden and Finland will not bring any new
capabilities that would drastically alter the balance of power in the
region, and other than intelligence sharing, would not add any material
advantage to an already overwhelmingly superior NATO. Given that Swedish
and Finnish conscription forces and reservists only come into play
during a war, and the chance of a war with Russia is negligible, they
are also not adding any significant manpower to NATO. NATO's "enhanced
forward presence" from Poland and the Baltic states, can already cover
and protect the allies in the region, as well as project power in the
Arctic without the need for any new bases in Sweden or Finland.
According to NATO's website, the force projection includes eight
multinational "battlegroups, led by the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany
and the United States respectively, \[which\] are robust and
combat-ready forces," and a "multinational brigade, under Multinational
Division Southeast in Romania" for improved situational awareness and
enhanced readiness.21 The Baltics and the Arctic are challenging
frontiers to defend, and some of the older arguments against NATO
enlargement touched upon it. Russia is considered to have an escalation
dominance in the region, due to sheer manpower it can muster in a full
spectrum war. However, [recent Russian experience in Ukraine, and the
negligible chance of a full spectrum war should ease some of the
concerns about mindless Russian imperial revanchism]{.underline}.
According to a Rand Corp analysis, even though the Baltics are hard to
defend in case of an actual war, [deterring Russia is relatively easy
with a few divisions of forward positioned troops, with the implied
threat that any casualty would trigger a NATO -- Russia war. Newer bases
in Finland and Sweden are unnecessary in that regard for any extended
deterrence in the region]{.underline}.22

### NATO Expansion Unnecessary -- Russia Weak 

#### Russia is so weak that expanding NATO is unnecessary

"NATO membership would strengthen Finland's security. As a member of
NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance," Finland's
President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said in a joint
statement citing the Russian threat of invasion. "Finland must apply for
NATO membership without delay."1The very same day, The Times of London
reported (albeit, per Ukrainian military sources) that [the Russians
lost an entire battalion with over 50 vehicles, and "as many as 73 T-72
and T-80 tanks, BMP armoured fighting vehicles, armoured tractors, a
tugboat and other equipment]{.underline} were destroyed[," and that
around 1,000 to 1,500 soldiers were killed, while crossing a tactical
bridge]{.underline} in Eastern Ukraine, arguably near Russian
strongholds.2

Threat is a combination of intention, power, proximity and capability.
For that reason, the lackluster performance of Russia in Ukraine, and
corresponding heightened threat perception in Europe, is baffling to
realists. After all, what is the hegemonic threat potential of a great
power across a continent that cannot provide air cover to its massacred
battalions over a pontoon bridge, much less total air supremacy over a
theatre of war? It is a pertinent line of inquiry. Wounded by her own
folly[, Russia remains without any demonstrable hegemonic capabilities
to conquer Ukraine and]{.underline} molest [parts of]{.underline}
Eastern Europe or [the]{.underline} wider [continent]{.underline}.3
[Without the threat of Russia as a hegemon, the argument in favour of
the US incurring further security commitments]{.underline} in Europe [by
expanding]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline} alliance [to Finland and
Sweden is weak.]{.underline}

### U.S. Won't Send Troops to Finland

#### Expansion will require more forces in Finland that the U.S. won't send

One step for NATO to take is obvious: deploy forces, immediately.
[Unlike during past NATO membership expansions, time is not on the
alliance's side here. If it's too late for pre-planning, then NATO must
quickly move to reposition troops into the alliance's new northeastern
flank.]{.underline} If the NATO allies are not willing to commit new
troops, this could be achieved by repositioning existing forces.
Alternatively, perhaps this is the time for the EU itself, given that
Finland and Sweden are both members, to fully commit to being a security
provider. The EU could fill the gap in force deployments by encouraging
its members to move forces to the Finnish-Russian border, potentially
leveraging NATO's command and control capabilities. Given that the
contributions to the Enhanced Forward Presence are shared in a fairly
equitable fashion among various NATO members, perhaps this approach can
be duplicated in Finland.

However, [under the current structure of NATO, the United States is the
ultimate backstop for]{.underline} such [deployments]{.underline}, [and
it will ultimately fall on Washington to fill in any gaps in forces for
Finland.]{.underline} This is problematic. [Though]{.underline} U.S.
President Joe [Biden and his admin]{.underline}istration [strongly
support Finland's and Sweden]{.underline}'s bids [to join
NATO]{.underline}, [it is unclear tha]{.underline}t the Biden team, or
any future [U.S. admin]{.underline}istration, [is willing to base
sizeable deployments]{.underline} of U.S. forces [on Finnish
territory]{.underline}.

To further complicate matters, forward [deploying troops]{.underline} on
Finnish territory [would not be a short-term commitment]{.underline}.
[Even if the war in Ukraine grinds to a halt, Russia will probably
retain]{.underline} or rebuild its ability to [carry out quick
incursions against its neighbors]{.underline}, which would then include
a Finland within NATO. [Defending Finland will require a
long-term]{.underline} and concrete [plan]{.underline} involving the
deployment of substantial forces. [Such a commitment would not come
without costs, both in terms of budget expenses and the potential
diversion of troops from other theaters]{.underline}.

Additionally, [questions should be asked about how Finland and Sweden
will contribute to the defense of NATO territory beyond their own
borders]{.underline}. Their presence alters NATO's map. Whether that
alteration is a net positive or negative for the alliance depends on
exactly how Sweden's and Finland's forces are used. While they have a
track record of working alongside NATO members in operations outside
NATO territory, will they, for example, assist with the Enhanced Forward
Presence? How exactly will they balance Russian operations in the
Arctic? These questions must be faced in the rush to add Finland and
Sweden to NATO.

### AT: NATO Expansion Reduces U.S. Defense Obligations

#### Adding Sweden and Finland won't reduce U.S. defense commitments -- those exist regardless

For any other military or intelligence needs, bilateral or EU frameworks
are more than sufficient.23 [Sweden and Finland's telecom companies such
as Nokia and Ericsson already can get privileged treatment and American
defense contracts, and provide a bulwark against Chinese dominance in
the domain; a formal alliance isn't necessary]{.underline} or needed
[for that]{.underline}. [The argument that adding more
countries]{.underline} [in the alliance will free up American troops is
also flawed, as]{.underline} historically [that has only led to further
Eastern European reliance]{.underline} and demands [as well as West
European free-riding on the American military.]{.underline} It is simply
ahistorical to contemplate that this particular dynamic would change
with Finland and Sweden within NATO. [Consider that Sweden is not even
in NATO yet, and is already calling for more US naval presence in the
Baltic sea]{.underline}.24 In fact, [Russian force posture towards
Finland and Sweden might change once they joi]{.underline}n NATO, [with
more potential]{.underline} Russian [bases in the Arctic, adding to
further increased demands of American military presence]{.underline}.25
The cost-benefit analysis suggests that [the only material difference
for NATO will be the cost of an additional nearly thousand-mile
frontier, and further chances of]{.underline} miscalculation and
[feeding of Russian paranoia]{.underline} about encirclement, which the
Russian ruling elite will use to further justify their worldview.
