DOD and the Department of State (DOS) have shared responsibility for

allocated to DOS. [**Any security [assistance]{.mark}** [*administered*

activity]{.underline}.21 After the terrorist attacks on September 11,
2001, the legal framework for the funding and administration of such
activities evolved in response to emerging threats. Congress
increasingly granted funding and authorities directly to DOD under Title
10 for security cooperation.22 Therefore, while DOS security assistance
programs can include DIB components, the majority of DIB-specific
programming is currently funded under and implemented by the Department
of Defense and is thus considered security cooperation.

[[Security cooperation is]{.underline}]{.mark} a compilation of
[financial, educational, and material [resources]{.mark},
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} at their foundation [[are supported by
the]{.mark} United States]{.underline}, in particular the
[[D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense]{.underline}, and are
used to support the peaceful development of democracies in foreign
countries. The [[resources provided by the Department of Defense]{.mark}
are available to foreign countries after the host nation]{.underline}
requests the peaceful assistance of the U.S. military in response to
systemic deficiencies in the bureaucratic management of a nation state
or when a nation state [recognizes that its military limitations prevent
it from properly defending its geographic borders]{.underline}. The host
nation's request for support from the U.S. is typically an effort by the
foreign country to develop its internal capacity to protect its people
and limit internal or external threats. The security cooperation
exercise Baltic Operation, held in Estonia, is an example of a foreign
country using the resources 9 provided by the United States to improve
its national defense capabilities in direct response to a perceived
threat to its sovereign borders. In this scenario Estonia is attempting
to develop its military capabilities and project an image of strength in
an effort to maintain the freedom it earned, from Russia, at the
conclusion of the Singing Revolution in 1992 and prevent a future
Russian incursion across its borders. [In contrast to this appropriate
use and definition of security cooperation]{.underline} as a strategy to
prevent conflict, the [Obama]{.underline} Administration [is using the
term security cooperation]{.underline} as a way [to]{.underline}
[define]{.underline} a national [exit]{.underline} strategy from a two
front war, a strategy that at its heart is based on the reconstruction
of a damaged infrastructure. [The false labeling of]{.underline}

[Introduction to [Security Cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}

Introduction

[The term security cooperation [was]{.mark} first [introduced]{.mark} in
1997 [by the Defense Reform Initiative]{.mark}]{.underline} (DRI). At
that time, the then named Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA)
already had day to day management responsibilities of many security
assistance programs authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and
the Armed Export Control Act (AECA). The DRI proposed that DSAA also
manage certain Department of Defense (DoD) funded international programs
along with their personnel and associated resources. So that other U.S.
government (USG) agencies, the private sector and foreign governments
could better understand DSAA's enlarged mission and diverse functions
beyond security assistance (SA), DoD re-designated DSAA as the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) effective 1 October 1998.

In recent years, DSCA has absorbed management responsibilities for many
DoD international programs. In addition, DSCA leads the broader USG
security cooperation enterprise. However, many security cooperation
programs continue to be managed by other elements of the Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD), the combatant commands (CCMDs) or the
military departments (MILDEPs). What further complicated the management
of security cooperation was that the in-country point of contact between
the USG and the host nation generally is either the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA) sponsored defense attaché office (DAO) or the DSCA
sponsored security cooperation office (SCO). These two spigots for
security cooperation with a country required a broad knowledge and skill
baseline of the very different international programs that are
initiated, funded, and managed throughout the DoD and its agencies and
the MILDEPs. Most disconnects regarding SCO-DAO coordination of
in-country security cooperation were generally resolved with the
establishment of the Senior Defense Official-Defense Attaché (SDO/DATT)
having oversight over both the SCO and DAO organizations. It was not
until 9 June 2004 that [DoD published a [formal]{.mark}]{.underline},
yet still very broad, [[definition of security
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} in Joint Pub 1-02:

> [[All DoD interactions]{.mark} with foreign defense establishments [to
> build defense relationships]{.mark}]{.underline} that promote specific
> U.S. security interests, develop allied and friendly military
> capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and
> provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to a host
> nation.

[DODD 5132.03]{.underline}, DoD Policy and Responsibilities Relating to
Security Cooperation, 29 December 2016, [further defines security
cooperation with assigned responsibilities]{.underline}:

> [All DoD interactions with foreign defense establishments to build
> defense relationships]{.underline} that promote specific U.S. security
> interests, develop allied and partner nation military and security
> capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and
> provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to allied
> and partner nations. This includes DoD administered security
> assistance programs.

**The most [clear and specific]{.underline} definition conclusively
requires the DoD**

**Reighard 6**, Lt Col in USAF (Robert, "SECURITY COOPERATION:

[Security cooperation has been a part of the U.S. Armed Forces for many
years]{.underline}. In fact, historians reveal that [the U.S. military
has always engaged in security cooperation with other countries and
their military forces]{.underline}. [However, the term used to designate
such activities is now "Security Cooperation," a term that has evolved
conceptually]{.underline} through various programs over the years.
[During the 1990s, the terms "engagement" and "shaping" were used
without]{.underline} sufficient [specificity]{.underline}; they were
often used interchangeably, [resulting in confusion]{.underline} that
led to problems in both planning and execution. [DOD thus adopted
"Security Cooperation" in 2001. It included a broad range of
military-to-military activities]{.underline}, but it also clarified
roles and responsibilities. [The term Security Cooperation thus
describes]{.underline} a broad range of [activities used by the
Department of Defense]{.underline} in peacetime operations. These
activities refer to all DOD interactions that are [carried out with
foreign defense establishments]{.underline}, such as combined exercises,
combined training, combined education, military-to-military contacts,
humanitarian assistance, and information operations.

**[Budget classification]{.underline} proves it's military-to-military**

[The]{.underline} Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 [President's Budget: Security
Cooperation]{.underline} Consolidated [Budget]{.underline} [Display
outlines seven categories of security cooperation]{.underline} activity,
including [military-to-military engagements]{.underline}, [support to
operations]{.underline}, and [humanitarian and assistance activities,
among others]{.underline}.6 The [security cooperation]{.underline}
[framework traditionally includes]{.underline} [security
assistance]{.underline} (SA), [security force assistance]{.underline}
(SFA), [and]{.underline} some aspects of [foreign internal
defense]{.underline} (FID).7 In the context of this article, [the term
security cooperation refers]{.underline} primarily [to
military-to-military engagement]{.underline}s, [where the U.S. military
engages in training partner forces under the auspices of Title 10 and
Title 22 authorities]{.underline}.

**Security Cooperation is military-to-military activity**

The United States and China have engaged in security cooperation on a
variety of international issues since the normalization of relations in
1979. In fact, security cooperation began even before the formal
establishment of state-to-state relations. We recall that during the
height of the Cold War the two nations demonstrated that when a pressing
and shared security concern in that case, the former Soviet Union
presented itself, Washington and Beijing were capable of working
together, extant differences notwithstanding. Security consultations and
sometime security cooperation between the two countries continue today.
But as the record of security cooperation is reviewed, one comes to the
conclusion that, for the most part, U.S.-China security cooperation has
been mainly of a political nature and operationalized at a high level of
strategic policy coordination. Security cooperation between the two
nations has been largely the purview of U.S. and Chinese civilian
officials and diplomats, not generals and admirals. In other words, over
the course of 30 years of relations, security cooperation between the
defense-military establishments of the United States and China \-- the
uniformed services \-- has been the exception rather than the rule. If a
serious discussion about future security cooperation between the U.S.
Navy and the PLA Navy is to take place \-- a leitmotif of this series of
conferences as described by the sponsors \-- then some of the issues,
challenges, and problems from the past need to be confronted even as we
look over the horizon. For the purposes of this paper, [security
cooperation is defined as the two militaries working together to achieve
a common objective \-- not high-level visits, exchanges, port calls, or
other activities that are mainly symbolic or representational in
nature]{.underline}.

[This briefing paper provides an overview of a central]{.underline}, but
often overlooked, [instrument of US]{.underline} remote [warfare:
security cooperation]{.underline}. In the briefing, [security
cooperation is defined as Department of Defense-managed programmes to
train, equip and advise foreign security forces to fight
alongside]{.underline}, or as surrogates for, [American 'boots on the
ground']{.underline}. Since the final years of the Bush administration,
this feature of remote warfare has emerged as a central instrument in
the US counterterrorism toolbox. In comparison to the kinetic face of
remote warfare, however, it remains poorly understood. This briefing
paper demonstrates the significance of security cooperation to remote
warfare. It focuses on the use of security cooperation in US
counterterrorism operations during the Obama presidency, with examples
drawn from efforts to combat Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and
Al-Shabaab. It concludes by briefly considering the future of security
cooperation under the Trump administration.

[Security cooperation is defined as the means by which the Department of
Defense encourages and enables countries to work with the United
States]{.underline}. It includes official, cooperative and general
non-combat interactions.4 [Military organizations conduct security
cooperation]{.underline} activities, as part of the range of military
operations. These activities are intended to build institutional
capacity within partner nation security structures so those nations can
become self-sufficient, secure their populations, control their borders
and contribute to regional peace. Security cooperation activities are
also aimed at developing peacetime interoperability between US and
partner forces so that in times of crisis, activities are executed
effectively and efficiently. The US also conducts security cooperation
to enhance relationships with partner nations and to gain dependable
host nation support. Though sometimes misconstrued, routine military
cooperation activities can evolve into relationships that help ensure
the US can successfully assist regional partners in times of crisis. For
example, US ability to position forces, equipment and supplies, or use
ports, warehouses and airfields when planning and conducting crisis
response operations could save time... and ultimately, lives.

**Even the broadest definitions requires the DoD**

**Williams 12**, Lt Col in Army National Guard (James, "The National
Guard State Partnership Program: Element of Smart Power,"
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA562110.pdf>)//BB

Similarly, the six Geographic Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) have
underscored security cooperation and building partner capacity as
essential to their respective Theater Strategy Plans and Country
Campaign Plans in support of National Security objectives. In every
COCOM posture statement the reader will find references 7 to the
importance of the concepts of cooperation, engagement, and building
partner capacity. ["Security Cooperation]{.underline}" [is defined
broadly as interactions between the Department of Defense and foreign
militaries that promote specific United States security interests;
develop allied and friendly military capabilities; and provide the
United States with both peacetime and contingency access to host
nations]{.underline}.12 Typical [security]{.underline}
[cooperation]{.underline} and engagement [activities include
military-to-military contact, coalition training, nation assistance and
long term operations]{.underline}. These types of activities range from
Navy ship port visits to combined training exercises, foreign military
education, leader conferences, foreign military sales and counter-drug
operations.

**Security Cooperation requires a [military branch]{.underline} to be
the implementing agency**

[In]{.underline} the [Security Cooperation]{.underline} Enterprise, [the
military departments loom large as the]{.underline} primary
[implementing agencies of]{.underline} Foreign Military Sales
([FMS]{.underline}) cases, Building Partner Capacity ([BPC]{.underline})
cases, [and]{.underline} in [training]{.underline} activities.\[6\]
These SC programs provide our international partners with the
capabilities they require both for their own security and to assist in
regional security objectives that improve the overall global security
situation. Most open [SC cases have one of the military departments as
an Implementing Agency]{.underline} (IA) [and each service has built its
own organizational structure, bureaucracy, and automated systems to
support the effort]{.underline}.\[7\]

**[SC\-\--Prefer Our Interp\-\--2NC]{.underline}**

**Given that basically [any]{.underline} activity is included, the [only
functional limit]{.underline} on the topic has to come at the
[agent-level]{.underline}**

**Mazarr 22**, senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation.
Previously he worked at the U.S. National War College, where he was

special assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Michael,
"Security Cooperation in a Strategic Competition," RAND,
<https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA650-1.html>)

To pursue this analysis, we first had to define the bounds of what we
would assess. [Official U.S. government definitions of security
cooperation are very broad.]{.underline} [One definition]{.underline}
from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency [states that security
cooperation]{.underline}

> [comprises all activities undertaken by]{.underline} the Department of
> Defense ([DoD) to encourage and enable international partners to work
> with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates to achieve strategic
> objectives. [It includes all DoD interactions with foreign defense and
> security establishments,]{.underline} including all DoD-administered
> Security Assistance (SA) programs, that build defense and security
> relationships; promote specific U.S. security interests, including all
> international armaments cooperation activities and SA activities;
> develop allied and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and
> multinational operations; and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and
> contingency access to host nations.3

[Such definitions clearly include almost any security-related activity
for any purpose.]{.underline} To scope the focus of the study, [we
reviewed]{.underline} official state documents and strategies and the
literature on security cooperation to identify [11 types of
activities]{.underline}:

1\. [military aid]{.underline}, which includes funding through the
Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, the Excess Defense Articles
program, and other grants and loans

2\. [arms sales]{.underline} and transfers,4 such as U.S. arms sales
through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales
(DCS) programs

3\. [military capacity-building]{.underline}, such as U.S. activities
under Section 1206 of the annual National Defense Authorization Act and
Sections and 2282 and 333 of U.S. Code, Title 10 (the train and equip
authority)

4\. [education and training]{.underline}, including international
military education and training (IMET), professional military education
(PME), and regional centers

5\. [personnel exchanges]{.underline}, such as U.S. activities under the
Military Personnel Exchange Program and the State Partnership Program

6[. military exercises]{.underline}, both bilateral and multilateral and
those that involve foreign partners

7\. [access-related agreements]{.underline}, such as status of forces
agreements (SOFAs) and agreements related to base access and
information-sharing

8\. [armament-related agreements]{.underline}, such as those for
co-development of systems and for research, development, test, and
evaluation activities

9\. [sustainment of donor-nation equipment]{.underline} by the donor,
the partner, or third parties

10\. [institutional capacity--building]{.underline} to strengthen the
partner institutions that support security services

11\. [humanitarian assistance and disaster relief]{.underline} (HA/DR),
which offers support for efforts to relieve suffering.

These categories offered a consistent template for gathering data across
our various study components. [A major challenge was that reliable and
consistent data on each of the 11 categories were not
available]{.underline} for all the competitors---not even for the United
States. Especially at the unclassified level, [there is simply no
comprehensive roster of security cooperation activities]{.underline} by
the United States, and neither China nor Russia publishes inclusive data
sets of its programs. An additional challenge was that, in some cases,
the different countries define the categories somewhat differently, so
we could not develop data on entirely comparable sets of security
cooperation activities.

**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate [plays a key role in [providing]{.mark}
**policy [direction]{.mark}** [for **Security Assistance**]{.mark}
**programs**. [Security Cooperation is]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[much
[broader]{.mark}]{.underline}** term that, [[**in addition to Security
Assistance**, includes]{.underline}]{.mark} such categories of
activities as [**combined [exercises]{.mark}**, **combined
[training]{.mark}**, **combined [education]{.mark}**,
**military-to-military [contacts]{.mark}**, **humanitarian
[assistance]{.mark}**[, and **info**]{.mark}**rmation
operations**]{.underline}.30 [It also refers to the **planning process**
DOD organizations use to implement these activities]{.underline}.

In essence, the Security Cooperation planning process is a systematic
method for translating strategic guidance into programmatic objectives.
The Office of the Secretary of Defense issues annual Security
Cooperation Guidance (OSD SCG) to guide the planning and activities of
Unified and Specified Commands, the military services, and other DOD
agencies and actors.31 The SCG promulgates strategic objectives based on
security themes derived from the National Security and Defense
strategies. It also provides regional and country priorities,
objectives, and measures of effectiveness for assessment.32 The Unified
and Specified Commands, the services, and other DOD players develop
subordinate plans to execute Security Cooperation activities in support
of OSD\'s objectives. The Unified Commands, for example, develop
regional strategies and country plans to guide the implementation of
security cooperation activities in their Areas of Operation.33

It is an oft-repeated mantra that in order to defeat transnational
terrorism, and by extension other related non-state threats, the United
States must apply all the elements of national power, including
diplomatic, informational, military, and economic.34 [The [OSD SCG
directs]{.mark}]{.underline} that [**DOD [Security Cooperation]{.mark}**
[\"will be **integrated** with **other elements of**]{.mark} **national
[power]{.mark}**]{.underline}.. .in order [[to
achieve]{.underline}]{.mark} national security, defense, and foreign
policy [[objectives]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"35 This formulation, while
helpful, obscures two key facts. First, [Security Cooperation includes
activities that]{.underline} by their very nature [involve]{.underline}
the simultaneous application of [more than one element of national
power]{.underline}. Security Cooperation at a minimum requires the
combination of diplomatic relations, military assistance,
military-to-military contacts, and public diplomacy. In other words,
Security Cooperation is itself an application of at least three of the
classic elements of national power.36 Second, [[DOD is **not** the
**only entity**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the USG [that interacts with
foreign governments to achieve the stated objectives]{.underline}:
relationships, capabilities, information and intelligence, and access.
The **[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate, the [**[Intelligence]{.mark}
Community**, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} to a lesser extent,
[**[other]{.mark} departments and [agencies]{.mark}**, conduct
activities aimed at the [accomplish]{.mark}ment of **these
[objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}, broadly understood. [[There
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, **[[no common]{.underline}]{.mark}**
USG, or **[[interagency, definition]{.underline}]{.mark}** or concept
[[of Security Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}.37 We will return to this
issue in the final section of this paper. For the purposes of the
present discussion, [[this paper offers the following]{.mark} **working
[definition]{.mark}** of Security Cooperation:]{.underline}

> [[Security Cooperation refers to **all**]{.mark} **USG

Part III of [[this paper offered a **definition** of Security
Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} that could be [[**common** to the
**entire US**]{.underline}]{.mark}G, [**[not just]{.mark}** the
**[D]{.mark}**]{.underline}epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense. [[The **US**]{.mark}**G
interagency** [has **no**]{.mark} **such [common definition]{.mark}**
because it lacks a **common conceptual understanding**]{.underline} of
how to translate higher level strategic guidance into specific programs
designed to accomplish strategic objectives.

The Department of Defense, despite its size, its diversity, and the
scope of its Security Cooperation activities, has such a common
understanding. DOD\'s process is not without its flaws.113 During the
late 1990s and the early 21st century, however, the department has
successfully established a rational set of procedures for translating
the strategic guidance in the National Security, Military, and, now,
Defense Strategies, into specific programs executed by the military
commands, services, and defense agencies.114 This process promotes
discipline by forcing subordinate organizations to demonstrate that
their Security Cooperation activities directly support specific
objectives in the higher-level strategies. Efforts are under way to
discipline the process further by establishing an assessment mechanism
to provide feedback on the effectiveness of programs and activities.115
One reason for the success of the DoD program is oSD\'s publication of
periodic Security Cooperation Guidance. This document, in addition to
providing authority for subordinate organizations\' Security Cooperation
activities (see more below), serves the purpose of an informal doctrine,
stipulating not only the \"what,\" but the \"how\" and the \"why\" of
Security Cooperation.116

In order for the USG interagency to plan and execute Security
Cooperation programs and activities in an integrated and synergistic
manner, a doctrine, or common conceptual framework, for Security
Cooperation is necessary. Such a doctrine would have to define what
Security Cooperation is, and, what it is not.117 It would have to define
precisely which departmental and agency programs qualify as Security
Cooperation and outline a procedure for combined interagency planning,
programming, and execution. Armed with such a common conceptual
framework, executive branch officials and program managers will be
better equipped to engage in integrated planning and program execution.
True success in this effort, however, will depend on the resolution of
the other problems of authority, funding, and process and organization.

\[Footnote 117\]

As has been suggested here, [[activities to improve **foreign**]{.mark}
**partners\' security [capabilities]{.mark}** [conducted by
**any**]{.mark} **department or [agency]{.mark}** [would qualify as
Security Cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}. In contrast, [general foreign
development assistance]{.underline}, although related to security and
part of broader U.S. foreign policy, [would probably not]{.underline}.
Even within DOD, this is not totally clear. Officials in OSD\'s
Counter-proliferation Policy office refused to admit that activities
intended to improve the maritime security capabilities of Azerbaijan and
Kazakhstan in support of counter-proliferation would be included under
the definition of Security Cooperation and declined to integrate their
program formally with other DOD Security Cooperation efforts.

#### [AFF GROUND]{.underline}\-\--limiting the AFF to the DOD eliminates [core affs]{.underline} like arms sales, training, and information sharing which require the guidance and resources of [other agencies]{.underline}. 

#### [NEG GROUND]{.underline}\-\--affs [still include]{.underline} the DOD, granting the neg the DOD PIC [and]{.underline} trade-off DA, and including [other actors]{.underline} gives the neg more PIC and DA ground. 

#### [GRAMMAR]{.underline}\-\--the resolution says, "The [USFG]{.underline} should..." the USFG [isn't only]{.underline} the DOD.

#### [REASONABILITY]{.underline}\-\--good is good enough.
