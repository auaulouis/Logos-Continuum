**[S]{.underline}**tates, the Atlantic Alliance and European
integration.

1\. [Insecurity in Central Europe fuels division in NATO and the
EU]{.underline}. A perception emerged following the Bush Administration
that enhanced U.S. security investments in Central Europe would
exacerbate divisions in Europe by perpetuating special bilateralism
within the Alliance. In fact, the opposite may be true: It is the
absence of a convincing security guarantee in Central Europe that may
act as the greatest stimulus to intra-European strategic divergence and
political disunity. EU Member States whose basic security needs are
satisfied possess the confidence to invest in the "normal" politics of
integration. Members lacking this assurance are more likely to focus
exclusively on the pursuit of hard power guarantees. The less these
needs are met, the louder the vulnerable members will likely become,
thereby highlighting their strategic dissimilarities with more secure
members and reinforcing their sense of political exclusion.

2\. [Insecure allies are less likely to support U.S. and NATO military
missions]{.underline}. On a per-capita basis, Poland, the Czech Republic
and their Central European neighbors have been some of the most generous
contributors to U.S. and NATO out-of-area operations. They were among
the first to respond to the winter 2009 U.S. surge with pledges of
reinforcements and currently have 5,900 troops in Afghanistan. These and
other contributions have definitively refuted claims made during the
1990s NATO enlargement debates that these states would be net consumers
of, and not contributors to, U.S. global security. With changes in the
regional security landscape, the perceived need for territorial defense
has increased. Unless this need is met preemptively, in an Alliance
context, exposed states may be tempted to over-invest in traditional
defense capabilities at the expense of out-of-area assets and training,
thereby potentially depriving the United States and NATO of support in
future crises.

3\. [Insecure allies are more likely to pursue assertive regional
policies]{.underline}. In the absence of convincing security assurances,
North Central European states could be tempted to pursue bolder foreign
and defense policies -- both as a form of strategic self-help and to
attract attention to regional issues within the Alliance. Evidence of
this tendency can arguably be seen in the 2008 Sikorski Doctrine as a
Polish corrective and corollary to the Medvedev Doctrine. NATO member
states should not feel compelled to invest in preventive self-help
strategies, which may be viewed as provocative in Moscow, resulting in
an assertive regional stance which in turn fuels deeper anxieties in
Poland and the Baltic States.

4\. [Insecure allies are poor role models]{.underline}. Developments
among the new EU Member States of Central Europe are closely monitored
by former Communist states further east, politically, economically and
in security. [The [robustness of U.S., NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} and EU
[security [commitments to]{.mark}]{.underline}, and reciprocal trust
from, [the countries of [Central Europe is **widely viewed as a
barometer** for the]{.mark} health and **[cred]{.mark}**ibility [of the
West]{.mark} in the post-Soviet space]{.underline}, irrespective of
these countries' aspirations for NATO membership. If security linkages
are perceived as weak or fraying, political elites in the East are less
likely to risk pro-democratic Western policy agendas.

America's [[deprioritization of allies creates **opportunities** for
revisionist powers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such transition is recurrent in
geopolitics; **[i]{.underline}**nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations
[are always characterized by **uncertainty**]{.underline}. Policy makers
have to navigate a landscape that is often difficult to delineate, full
of strategic actors whose purposes are often obscure and whose power is
difficult to assess. [**Intentions** are notoriously hard to
divine]{.underline}, in part because rival states obfuscate them but in
part because often the states themselves do not have a clear and
consistent perception of what they want to achieve. [**Uncertainty**
arises]{.underline} also out of a more quantifiable source of knowledge,
an assessment of hard power, which is imperfect and results in widely
different estimates. It is sufficient to recall the challenges of
assessing Soviet power throughout the Cold War.

Moments characterized by alleged **[[large shifts]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in relative power [[present]{.mark} particularly **acute
[problems]{.mark}** [of assessing]{.mark} **power** and
**[intent]{.mark}**ions, [adding]{.mark} an additional **layer** of
**ambiguity** and **[uncertainty]{.mark}**. **Rumors** of change put in
doubt the relatively]{.underline} well- known, or at least [familiar,
geopolitical situation]{.underline}. All parties involved are unsure
about their position relative to the others, the extent of their
political sway, and the match between their commitments and their power.
The [established great [powers may have a **crisis of
confidence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, while emboldened rising states are
uncertain how far their influence extends as well as how solid and
credible is the power reach of their weakening rival. Revisionist powers
now openly but cautiously question what was the grudgingly accepted
geopolitical status quo.

Rising powers are thus curious but careful. They are interested in
pushing the existing boundaries of their influence but do not know how
far they can do so without meeting a firm opposition of the other power.
In the current case, U.S. rivals--- [[China, Russia, and Iran]{.mark}---
appear keen to assert their influence]{.underline} and establish what
they deem their rightful position in their respective regions and in the
world but are also eager to avoid a direct confrontation with the United
States. [Uncertain]{.underline} about their own power relative to the
United States, [they **[test]{.mark} the hypothesis** of]{.underline} a
[growing [American]{.mark}]{.underline} economic and [military fragility
and [decaying]{.mark} political [reach]{.mark}]{.underline}. To figure
out the new map of power, and possibly to redraw it at low cost,
[revisionist powers engage [in **probing**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In this chapter we examine this behavior--- the probing by revisionist
powers. We define probing as a low- intensity and low- risk test aimed
at gauging the opposing state's power and will to maintain security and
influence over a region. It is a set of actions that studiously avoids a
direct military confrontation with the leading power by targeting the
outer limits of its commitments and interests. There, along the outer
rim of its influence, the hegemon is at the furthest of its commitments
and power projection. The perception, or rather the suspicion, of its
decline is most consequential along these frontiers of power because the
revisionist state senses opportunities in its own neighborhood and
searches for confirmation of the rival's weakness.

Probing is an opportunistic behavior. It occurs when the revisionist
states detect a permissive international situation, namely, when they
think that the existing great power is retreating. It is still a
behavior that is characterized by self- doubt and uncertainty, although
if unanswered it results in the confirmation of the belief in the
rival's decline and may lead to ever more assertive challenges to the
international order and expansions of influence by the geopolitical
challenger.

Over the past few years, and with greater frequency and brazenness,
regional powers opposed to the United States have been engaging in
probing. Russia, Iran, and China in their respective regions have been
working under the hypothesis that the United States is retreating, out
of choice, fatigue, or weakness, or all three combined. The American
retrenchment is more pronounced in the Middle East, with the ending of
U.S. combat presence in Iraq and the drawdown in Afghanistan as well as
the unwillingness to intervene in Syria, leaving a vacuum for Iranian
influence. But there is an equally pervasive perception of American
withdrawal or decline in the other two key regions, Europe and Asia. In
Europe, the perception is that Washington is redirecting its strategic
focus and resources toward Asia and has limited willpower to back its
extended deterrent, giving Moscow a window of opportunity to redraw the
map in Europe's eastern "borderlands. " And in Asia, a rising and
confident China looks at a United States hobbled by financial crises,
fiscal imbalances, and a decade- long military overstretch in the Middle
East. The reasons are different, but the broad perception is similar:
the revisionist states sense an opening left by a distracted and
weakening United States. And they probe along the periphery of American
influence, from Ukraine to the South China Sea through the Persian Gulf.

ORIGINS OF PROBING BEHAVIOR

Probing stems out of a tentative belief that the existing geopolitical
order is amenable to change, and it seeks to confirm this suspicion. A
perceived geopolitical change remains only that, perceived, until facts
on the ground confirm it. An assessment of a state's power is merely an
estimate of how that state may fare in a clash with others. As such, it
informs a set of expectations for the future, and it may or may not
reflect reality. Often there is little agreement among powers as well as
within those powers as to which assessment of power is correct.1 Today,
for instance, questions about the continued resilience of American power
abound both abroad and in the United States, and there are analysts on
both sides of the argument.2 Regardless of where one stands on the issue
of American relative decline or retrenchment, the mere existence of such
a debate is a source of concern because it points to an absence of
clarity on the geopolitical scene. The various strategic actors no
longer know where they stand on the international pecking order and are
confused as to how far their own influence can reach and what the
responses of their rivals may be.3 These are periods of a tense peace
but also of great uncertainty about the nature of the security
environment. As a scholar put it, it is the "fog of peace" that makes
strategic planning more difficult because it is unclear who the enemy
is, how much power a potential rival may have, and where the boundaries
of political influence are.4 As history indicates, often such an
uncertain strategic environment degenerates into war, which is a
"dispute about the measurement of power. "5

The outcome of a war is the violent clarification of such confusion. It
settles the dispute about the assessment of power. A victory or defeat
in war, followed by changes in boundaries, military bases, or political
affiliations of governments, is one way to prove or disprove a perceived
alteration in relative power. As British historian A.J.P. Taylor
observed, the "test of a Great Power is . . . the test of strength for
war. "6 After its defeat in the 1853-- 1856 Crimean War, Russia was
clearly militarily inferior to European states (even though the
victorious powers, Britain, France, Turkey, and later Austria, also
encountered serious difficulties in projecting power to the Black Sea
theater) and consciously chose to retreat, reform, and rebuild its
foundations of power, known as a policy of recueillement, in order to
maintain its status as a European great power.7 There is no clearer
confirmation of a state's decline than a loss in a direct confrontation
with a rising power; there is equally no better proof that the
perception of relative decline was incorrect when the aspirant
revisionist state is soundly defeated. In the immediate aftermath of a
war it is therefore easier to assess one's own power relative to that of
the other players. War lifts the "fog of peace. "

But war is rarely pursued simply to clarify one's own uncertain standing
relative to the other strategic actors. To engage in war, the ultimate
test of power, is exceedingly dangerous, and no leader wants to enter
into a violent conflict simply as a way of assessing the power of its
own state relative to the target. Wars are realms of luck and un knowns
as much as of more calculable kinetic clashes, and consequently the
outcomes do not always align with the expectations preceding them.8 In
fact, the losing party in a conflict has often entered that war having
overestimated its own capability relative to the rival. Many in Europe,
for instance, expected in summer 1914 to be "home for Christmas, " only
to remain in the bloody trenches for several years. Given this inherent
uncertainty, the risk of being proven wrong for both the perceived
rising and declining powers is high, and great powers in history seem to
stumble into wars rather than consciously pursue them as tests of
strength. The risks of war are incalculable and thus extremely high.

A less risky way of assessing a changing equilibrium of power is through
probing. This is a form of strategic behavior meant to test existing
perceptions of power relations, seeking at the same time to draw the
presumably new boundaries of influence. The rising or revisionist state,
in particular, is strongly motivated to test the will of its seemingly
declining rival power. It has the aspiration, mitigated by the fear of
the rival great power, to alter the existing geopolitical map. Such
states, unhappy with the existing international order, which they
perceive perhaps as imposed on them and certainly as increasingly not
reflective of their own rising aspirations and power, have the most to
gain from probing. If this behavior confirms the perception that the
existing great power is on the wane and that the map drawn by it is no
longer supported by its strength and will, the revisionist state may be
able to reassert lost influence over its neighborhood and revise a
previous settlement. At the same time, such a state has also a strong
incentive to avoid a direct clash with its main antagonist lest the
perception of its relative weakening turns out not to match reality. A
strategy of direct confrontation is risky because its success is
predicated on the relative weakness of the targeted power, the existing
hegemon, and this is exactly what is unknown. If the probing power
becomes convinced that its hypothesis of its own superiority (and of the
relative decline of the rival) is true, then a direct clash may occur.
But until that confirmation, a safer, less risky course of action is to
engage in a probing behavior, akin to testing the water before jumping
in. Probes target the frontier of the rival power's influence, where its
interests are less pronounced, its power is at its farthest projection,
and its political clout at its weakest. At these outer edges the
response of the great power is expected to be most restrained, while the
gains of the probing state are most likely to occur.

The purpose of probing, therefore, is to gauge the resolve of the
targeted powers. We will return to this later, but here it is important
to note that a probing action is also a way of showing the renewed or
freshly acquired capabilities and aspirations that otherwise would
remain latent and without tangible effects. One cannot revise an
established order by keeping one's own intentions and capabilities
hidden.

Showing a new military platform, often in a carefully choreographed
event, is one way of signaling growing power. The 1907-- 1909 voyage of
the American "Great White Fleet, " meant to showcase the emergent global
naval strength of the United States, was one such episode. The round-
the- globe cruise was not targeted at a specific power and did not aim
to extend American influence over a particular state or region. Rather,
it was a broad assertion of American capabilities and global reach, and
the other powers, Great Britain in particular, certainly received it as
a sign that the United States was a power to be reckoned with.

But probing is more than showing off. It is not simply an action of
strutting on the world stage with newly acquired military gadgets and
political confidence but a precisely targeted action with clear
objectives. Through probing, a revisionist state aims at changing the
existing geopolitical order where it thinks it can, namely, at the
farthest points of the ruling great power's influence. Probing,
therefore, is not just mere signaling of displeasure with the rules of
the international order and the map of power; it aims to revise the
order gradually and carefully, starting from the outer layers of the
rival great power's influence.

FEATURES OF PROBING

The purpose of probing is threefold. First, a probing state aims to
check whether the rumors of its rival's weakening are true. A probe is a
test, meant to elicit a response from the targeted power. Second, the
revisionist state that engages in probing behavior wants to avoid a
direct military clash with the existing great power. The risks of being
wrong about the rival's resolve and capability are simply too big.
Third, the state's objective is to achieve, if possible, low- cost
revision of the existing regional order.

These purposes can be seen in the features that characterize a probe and
distinguish it from other types of behavior, ranging from fullout
aggression to commercial pressures and diplomatic démarches. First,
probes are low intensity, vigilantly avoiding a direct war with the main
rival power. They are below the horizon of direct military
confrontation. The revisionist state has no interest in starting an
allout military conflict with the rival great power, perhaps declining
but still more than a match. The level of violence used, therefore, is
low, and probes are limited projections of power in areas of less
pronounced interest to the rival. A probing power engages in a lot of
selfrestraint; it intentionally elects to keep the use of force at a
minimum. It can but chooses not to escalate. A probe is a calculated
gamble, not a foolish thrashing around.

The desire to avoid a war with the existing hegemon often leads the
revisionist to project power under cover of civilian or paramilitary
forces, part of a larger trend of "civilianization" of conflict.9 By
using unmarked units to harass a U.S. protégé, a state is able to de ny
authorship of provocative actions and thereby avoid a more violent and
direct war while at the same time chipping away at the rival's influence
and wealth. The possibility of denying that an aggression has occurred
drives costs of revisionism lower. For instance, the sixteenth- century
privateer Sir Francis Drake acted on behalf of Queen Elizabeth I,
raiding Spanish shipping but never in an official capacity. The queen
went so far as to tell a Spanish ambassador that "Drake was a private
adventurer, and that she had nothing to object to his alleged execution.
" She was careful in not provoking Spain too much but eager to "singe
the King of Spain's beard. "10

A similar approach can be seen around the world today. The initial
Russian push into Crimea in 2014 was done anonymously with unmarked
special forces, dubbed by Ukrainians as the "little green men, " a clear
example of a long- standing Russian practice of tactical deception and
disguise (maksirovka).11 It was an indication that Moscow was unsure
whether Ukrainian forces would react, and, in the event of a determined
opposition, it maintained the option of either escalating with larger
conventional forces or halting operations and denying. Moscow seemed to
be more careful in masking the identity of its forces in eastern
Ukraine, where the local opposition was more assertive and the Western
displeasure with Russian aggression more pronounced. The greater the
risk of a strong response from the actors targeted, the more carefully
tailored, dissimulated, and low- intensity is the probe. The use of
unmarked troops and paramilitary forces allows Russia to claim that no
aggression has occurred, and thus no military response from Ukraine or
from the West is warranted.

China has been testing the limits of the influence of the United States
and its allies in the South China Sea using an array of civilianlooking
vessels. Its fishing fleet, combined with a fishery- enforcement fleet,
is integrated into its military institutions and plays an active role in
expanding China's maritime reach. As Lyle Goldstein observes, this is
part of a "strategy of 'defeating harshness with kindness' (yi rou ke
gang)" whereby China deploys "unarmed fishing vessels or fisheries
enforcement vessels to confront foreign vessels operating in its EEZ and
claimed waters. "12 This low- intensity push tests the fron tier of
American influence in a way that makes a U.S. response difficult.13 A
foray by a Chinese naval vessel into contested waters can be countered
with the might of the United States and its ally's navy; a probe by
fishing vessels manned by Chinese fishermen does not warrant the
involvement of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. This is risky behavior, but it
also indicates a desire by China to avoid a war with the other regional
powers as well as with the United States.14

If it is openly a military attack, a probe is conducted with a strong
and perhaps warranted belief that the rival power will not intervene
because it is distracted elsewhere and because it deems the targeted
region to be of little immediate interest. This was the case of the
Russian war with Georgia in 2008, when Moscow felt emboldened by NATO
ambivalence to extending its membership process to Tbilisi and by the
American strategic distraction by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
(where a small Georgian contingent was deployed). The Russian gamble was
based on the expectation of no meaningful Western, and American in
particular, response. The objective was to chip away at the unwelcome
Western influence in Russia's neighborhood but without spurring an
equally unwelcome Western military reply--- to "singe America's beard, "
as it were.

Second, a revisionist state engages in probing because it sees it as a
low- risk but high- reward behavior. The low risk stems in part from the
first feature, the carefully tailored level of aggressiveness that is
expected not to elicit a full- out military response by the rival. It is
also related to the third feature, explained below, namely, the fact
that the immediate target of probing is geographically and political
peripheral to the interests of the rival great power, and consequently
contributes to the low likelihood of a forceful military response. But
on top of being pursued as a low- risk action, a probe can yield high
strategic rewards. Most often the revisionist power seems to direct
probing behavior to its immediate vicinity, hoping to expand its
influence over neighboring and thus more controllable regions.15 It is
there that it has the greatest chances of extending its own political
shadow successfully. Probes are rarely long- distance projections of
power because incursions deep into the rival's sphere of influence are
more liable to be met with more assertive responses as well as being
less likely to establish durable control by the probing state. The
farther the revisionist state engages in probing behavior, the more high
risk and low reward it is, and vice versa. Hence the more likely
locations for probing behavior are in the near neighborhood of the
revisionist power.

Furthermore, probes focus on strategically important regions, either
resource rich or located along lines of communication, or both.
Elizabethan England, for example, conducted raiding probes of Spain's
vulnerable transatlantic arteries bringing gold from the New World---
not its stronger positions in the Mediterranean. Imperial Germany's
probes of the Anglo- French alliance targeted Morocco, located near the
strategically important choke point of Gibraltar but beyond easy reach
of the main British fleet. Today China's probes of U.S. allies in Asia
often target oil and gas fields in the South China Sea. In all these
cases, since the goal of probing is to test the power and commitment of
a rival state, it has to be directed at regions where the rival's
influence is present but not preponderant. It is unlikely that regions
of no geostrategic value or with few resources have much of a presence
of the rival great power, and as such they are not prime material for
probing. A state may still have imperial aspirations in such regions,
but not every extension of power is a probe. Probing is not simply
grabbing new areas of influence but first and foremost to test the will
of the rival. There may be, of course, the bonus that if the probe is
successful, it may result in the addition of strategically important
regions.

The third feature of probing is that it is peripheral or indirect. The
target of the probe is the periphery or the frontier of the tested power
where the rival's presence is at its farthest reach, its interests are
less pronounced, and thus its response is expected to be muted. Fearful
of a militarily assertive response, the state that is probing is careful
not to target areas that are clearly considered of primary and
existential interests, such as the rival's homeland or its immediate
neighbors. Hence the visits of Russian or Iranian naval vessels to
Venezuelan ports are less a probe per se than an act of grandstanding,
since all sides know that the United States could quickly bring
overwhelming force to bear in the event of a crisis. These are temporary
publicity stunts rather than a calculated attempt to test the hegemon's
commitment to maintaining the status quo.

Probes test for perceived weaknesses, not strengths, and it is on the
outer boundaries of the existing great power that its influence is
likely to appear the most fragile. The revisionist power is interested
in probing the power and influence of its rival in places where that
influence is at its weakest, overstretched, and uncertain. During the
Peloponnesian War the Spartan general Brasidas adopted such a peripheral
strategy, but only a decade into the conflict. The initial Spartan
approach of annual invasion of Attica, Athens's immediate neighborhood,
failed to inflict sufficient damage to end the war. It was only with
Brasidas, sent north with a small force of helots (minimizing thus the
risk to Spartan manpower), that Sparta changed its strategy to one
similar to probing, by persuading or forcing distant Athenian allies in
Thrace to switch sides. And many did reconsider their allegiance to
Athens, because, as Thucydides observes, there did not seem to be much
risk given the distance from Athens and their belief that this empire
was on the wane.16 Striking the rival's periphery, and its allies, not
only was cheaper than assaulting it directly but also forced it to
devote a lot of resources to reasserting the lost influence.

Global powers in particular have a "periphery or frontier problem" that
invites probing. A lengthy frontier, distant from the homeland and thus
from key logistical bases, is difficult to protect. The sheer amount of
power needed to outfit the distant outposts, combined with the
uncertainty as to the location and timing of potential attacks, makes it
impossible to have an impermeable frontier. When a power assesses
threats, the key questions of "where, when, and by whom" are directly
related to the length of the imperial frontier. A regional power has
well- delimited borders and a clear idea of who the rival is. For
instance, from the final decade of the nineteenth century on, Germany
was burdened with the possibility of a two- front war, with France on
one side and Russia on the other; a serious problem of military planning
caused by poor diplomacy but not a source of strategic confusion. For a
global power, it is that strategic clarity that is missing, resulting in
the need to prepare for multiple contingencies and ultimately to stretch
resources in several theaters of potential action.17 While imperial
Germany could concentrate on its two- front problem, Great Britain at
the turn of the twentieth century had to consider threats from Russia
(in Central Asia, pushing toward India), Japan (in the Asian littoral
sphere), France (in Africa as well as the Mediterranean), and Germany
(in Europe and the North Sea in particular). Through deft diplomacy, it
managed to neutralize the first three, allowing it to focus on the
German naval threat, thereby limiting its "frontier problem. "

In practice, probing the periphery of a rival's great power often
translates into testing the strength of its alliances. Most great
powers, or empires, expand their influence in informal ways, through
political arrangements with local elites and formal alliances.18 The
security of these great powers, in particular of ones with global reach,
therefore resides not only in the safety of their borders but in their
ability to hold rivals at a distance and thwart their challenges to
faraway interests. They do so only in part through their own forces and
rely heavily on the presence of allies that provide additional military
strength and local deterrence (see chapter 5). Allies are at the
periphery of influence and strength of great powers, and it is there
that the powers' commitment and influence are at their weakest. It is
clear that a state will respond to an encroachment on its territorial
possessions or to an attack against its forward deployed forces. It is
less certain, however, that a state will respond in the same strong
fashion to similar actions directed against its allies and their
interests. The security guarantee extended to them, the foundation of
the alliance, is a promissory note that carries a high degree of
uncertainty. Placing bases with troops on the territory of an ally is a
time- tested way of diminishing this uncertainty. As Thomas Schelling
put it, the role of U.S. troops in South Korea was simply to die,
buttressing the American security guarantee to its ally.19 The loss of
American soldiers to an initial attack by the enemy would, so the
argument goes, create powerful pressures for Washington to respond.
French general Ferdinand Foch, when asked before World War I how many
British troops would be needed for the security of France, replied, "One
single private soldier . . . and we would take good care that he was
killed. "20

Probes by the revisionist power are not attacks against these bases and
forces that underwrite the credibility of the extended deterrent.
Rather, they target areas that may be of great importance to the ally
but not necessarily to the security patron. That is the periphery of the
periphery, so to speak, the tip of the great power's commitment.

The United States has a particularly pronounced "periphery" problem.
There are few direct threats to the continental United States, short of
a large- scale assault with weapons of mass destruction or the tragic
yet relatively small and isolated terrorist attack. While the absence of
a contiguous threat is a geopolitical blessing, it also means that most
of the menaces to U.S. interests and security are outside of the North
American continent. Hence, in the competitive international environment,
"the strategic position of the United States rests ultimately on its
ability to project power over great distances. "21 In practice this
entails managing alliances that maintain stability and keep U.S. rivals
on the defensive in key regions of the world, in particular along an arc
from Europe to East Asia through the Middle East. And historically this
has been, and continues to be, achieved by extending U.S. deterrence
beyond the North American continent to the countries, some allied by
treaty and some neutral. Such an extended deterrence is a " 'three-
nation problem' involving an aggressor nation, the United States, and
some smaller nation which is the object of the aggressor's designs and
which Washington seeks to protect. "22 Probing by an "aggressor nation"
aims to test U.S. commitment to these "smaller nations, " which
constitute the periphery of American interests and power.

In the most successful case, probing could achieve a dual purpose:
first, it tests the level and credibility of the commitment of the
distant security patron, and second, it can weaken the rival alliance.
It does so by targeting the foundation of the alliance, the belief that
the alliance is beneficial to both parties and that it is effective. As
Michael Mandelbaum has observed, alliances need to manage two concurrent
fears: one of entrapment, namely, of being dragged into undesirable wars
of limited significance and local interest, and one of abandonment, the
apprehension of often the weaker ally of be ing abandoned by its
security provider when the need comes. 23 Probing aims to increase the
rival's fear of entrapment while at the same time stoking worries of
abandonment among its weaker and more dependent partners. By harassing
the local interests of the rival's peripheral allies, the revisionist
power wants to drive up the risk of a local war, perceived by the rival
as a distraction and a potential drain of resources. At the same time,
it wants to indicate to the smaller allies that they may not rely on
their security provider to defend their local, narrow interest, and that
they may be abandoned. The goal is to drive a wedge in the opposing
alliance by leveraging the fundamental dilemma of alliances--- the fears
of entrapment and abandonment.

This is where probing becomes more than a simple test of the rival's
strength. By targeting the outer edges of the existing hegemon, and thus
harassing its alliance system, the revisionist is engaging in a much
more significant endeavor. The contest for regional, or global, control
is in the end a contest for allies. A.J.P. Taylor observed that when
Germany "was bidding for the domination of Europe" in the decade before
the outbreak of World War I, "her chosen method was to isolate the
independent Powers one from another. "24 As we point out in chapter 5,
allies are, among other things, an extension of the distant patron's
power. Were they to peel away from the side of their security
guarantor--- or vice versa, were the security guarantor to decide that
the risk of continued support of a distant ally pressured by a regional
revisionist power is too big--- it would in either case signify a
retrenchment of power for that offshore patron. The loss of allies is
both a confirmation of the waning sway of that rival great power as well
as a further reduction in its reach. To be alone in inter national
relations is to be vulnerable, inviting further aggressive behavior from
the rival. Walter Lippmann observed in 1943, "No one knew, not Hitler,
not Stalin, not Chamberlain or Daladier, the relative strength of the
Axis and of the opposing combination. Only when Hitler succeeded at
Munich in separating the Franco- British allies from Russia, had he so
altered the balance of power in his favor that a war for the conquest of
Europe was from his point of view a good risk. "25 War is an extension
of successful probing.

The benefits of targeting allies of a rival, rather than the rival
itself, are well recognized in history. The astute observer of history
and politics Niccolò Machiavelli noted in his Discourses that attacking
a rival's ally is always a preferred option: "For I know especially that
if I assault his friend, either he will resent it and I will have my
intention of making war with him, or by not resenting it he will uncover
his weakness or faithlessness in not defending a client of his. Both the
one and the other of these two things are able to take away his
reputation and to make my plans easier . "26 In the strategic behavior
we describe, the probing power is not interested in "making war" with
the rival, and therefore a probe is not a full- out attack on a rival's
ally or supported state. The risks of activating the security guarantees
or assurances that ought to be at the foundation of that alliance are
too big. But it is an offensive act of sorts, which threatens the
interests of the rival's ally. The security patron will either respond,
thereby disproving the perception of its weakness, or will not, "taking
away his reputation" and undermining its alliance.

China has been particularly astute in picking geographic objectives that
are important to U.S. allies but only indirectly important to the United
States, such as the shoals and reefs around the Spratly and Paracel
Islands. By ratcheting up the pressure in these areas, China causes the
targeted states to intensify their demands for American assurance while
diminishing U.S. willingness to back allies over seemingly petty issues
that could lead to a larger conflict. Americans do not want to risk
their lives for insignificant and distant rocks. Russia achieves a
similar effect by reigniting NATO's eastern frontier through its attack
on Ukraine and a series of threats against exposed NATO members around
the Baltic Sea. Those are areas that until recently have not been
prominent on the U.S. strategic radar screen but are naturally vital to
those smaller states inhabiting the region, which in turn are driven to
make increasingly vocal requests for security reassurances from
Washington. As in the case of the South China Sea, however, the local
and limited nature of the rival's probes generates in Washington as much
a perception of threat as fear of a larger conflict, raising doubts
about the benefits of extending security guarantees to these allies and
partners. In the end, these peripheral probes pursued by U.S. rivals can
create a wedge between Washington and its regional friends and allies.

These three features--- low intensity, low risk but high reward,
peripheral--- point also to the timing of the probing behavior. Probing
is a strategic behavior that arises out of an uncertain assessment of
power relations. It is the product of doubt, not confidence, in the
resilience of the existing international order. As such it arises early
on in the transition of power, when perceptions of rise and decline are
not firm. The vagueness of the security environment creates among
revisionist powers the perception of opportunities that a probing
behavior aims to test. Hence probing should occur with less frequency in
the immediate aftermath of a war, when, as we point out, an assessment
of relative power carries the weight of the ultimate test, war. A
defeated power may have all the incentives to upset the existing order,
but unless it has no ability to evaluate its clearly weakened position,
it has no capacity to do so. After a defeat probing may be tempting but
is unfeasible. Such states are more likely to pursue a policy of
recueillement (introspection, a moment of pause and strengthening),
characterized by internal reforms, modernization, and very limited
foreign engagements mostly aimed at dividing the opposing alliance.27

When, however, the perceived weakening of the founding power puts in
doubt the existing international settlement, the desire to revise it is
matched by the possibility of doing so. The perception of American
weakening, or at least retrenchment, therefore opens up a window of
opportunity for those powers that aspire to expand their own influence
and resent the Western order and its institutions.

THE AUDIENCES OF PROBING

Another useful way of looking at the strategic behavior of probing is by
considering the audiences involved. As we argued, a revisionist power
pursues probing behavior to check whether new boundaries of influence
are feasible given the perceived weakening of the rival. The main
purpose is therefore to elicit a response from the targeted audiences.
That response, or lack thereof, supplies information necessary to draw
the new outline of the geopolitical map. Probing is first and foremost a
violent and risky didactic exercise.

The most direct audience is the immediate target of the probing
behavior, usually an ally, or an aspirant to be an ally, of the rival
great power. Probing here seeks to gauge the willingness and capacity of
the targeted state to withstand pressure, and ultimately it aims to push
that state to sever itself from its security patron. As we examine in
chapter 4, vulnerable frontier allies of a great power actively consider
alternative strategic options, especially when they perceive themselves
to be under threat from a neighboring revisionist pow er and to have a
fraying security guarantee from a distant patron. A probe is meant to
ratchet up the threat perception while also attempting to establish a
sense of strategic isolation and separation from the security provider.

Hence as important as, if not more important than, the first audience is
the second one: the distant but more powerful ally and security
provider. Probing tests indirectly the regional staying power of the
rival hegemon. While carefully avoiding direct confrontation, the
revisionist power wants to assess the commitment of the opposing great
power to its ally in the near neighborhood. What the revisionist is
testing, therefore, is not the rival's resolve to oppose other great
powers, but the rival's reliability to its own allies.28 Resolve is the
willingness to risk war to achieve one's own objectives: the more
diffuse and distant the threatened interests, the less the resolve.
Given that the target of probes is peripheral and not the rival's
homeland or troops and bases, the resolve is assumed to be small. Direct
war between the revisionist probing state and the rival great power is
unlike ly to erupt as a result. Moreover, the probing state is not
interested in finding out whether the rival has the will to fight a
direct war: the stakes would be simply too high and the outcome too
uncertain. A direct challenge would test the resolve of the rival.
Poking around the periphery, therefore, is a poor test of the rival's
willingness to fight a war. History seems to confirm this. For instance,
as scholars have pointed out, Soviet leaders did not think that U.S.
responses to peripheral threats (e.g., in the Third World) could serve
as indicators of future American behavior when its core interests (NATO
allies, Japan, or the U.S. homeland) were threatened.29 Whether the
United States responded militarily or not to a Soviet foray in Angola or
Ethiopia could not be easily translated into expectations of future
American behavior in Europe. But it does affect the perception of
whether the United States wants to fight in other peripheral areas. "If
Soviet leaders were to gain the impression that the United States is
firmly set upon a course of neo- isolationism and the absolute avoidance
of intervention in local wars, they might become dangerously adventurous
in the Middle East and elsewhere. "30

[Probing]{.underline}, however, [tests the reliability of the rival
great power--- that is, its willingness to **protect**]{.underline} and
stand by [its **ally**]{.underline} or aspiring allies. The immediate
target is not a test of the rival's general credibility but only of its
commitment to the security ties to the state. Probing wants to elicit a
response (or lack thereof) from the rival great power regarding the
seriousness of its commitment to the directly targeted state. [[To be
**perceived** as]{.mark} a **[reliable]{.mark}** ally [means to
**instill**]{.mark} **the [belief]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} **promised**
security [guarantees will **hold** **even in**]{.mark} **cases of
heightened [tensions]{.mark}** and, in final analysis, of conflict.
Consequently [a **perception of low reliability** results in]{.mark} the
[belief]{.mark} that the **[alliance is fragile]{.mark}** and that it
may be in the small state's interest to seek accommodation with the
nearby revisionist power]{.underline}. As delineated above, probes are
care fully tailored to split the distant security patron from its
regional allies, showing it to be unreliable.

Even if it achieves nothing else, probing can introduce doubts about the
security guarantees, forcing the security patron to renew its promises.
[The **less reliable** the security patron is perceived by its allies,
the more insistent are their **demands** for **continued** security
guarantees]{.underline}. Probing thus imposes an immediate cost on the
rival great power by reactivating a frontier region that until then was
dormant and by pressing the rival to expend more resources and political
capital to reassert its security guarantees.

Finally, the third audience is composed of the geopolitical onlookers,
[states]{.underline} that are **[watch]{.underline}**ing the
[[behavior]{.mark} and derive]{.underline} their own [conclusions about
the resilience of the existing great power. The strategic
interaction]{.underline} spurred by a probe [does not **directly**
affect them, but they perceive it as a regionally circumscribed
development with potentially more **global repercussions**. That is, a
probe is limited to a specific region but [has **radiating
effects**]{.mark} as [others]{.mark} also **[see]{.mark} it for what it
really is**: [a **test** of the]{.mark} **resilience** and
[**reliability** of the]{.mark} great [power]{.mark} that may be
[**analogous** in **other regions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Recent academic literature puts in doubt the idea that reputation for
commitment is interdependent]{.underline}. Thomas Schelling, among
others, articulated that idea in his classic work from 1966 where he
argued that [U.S. **[rep]{.mark}**utation [was
**global**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[a loss in one
region]{.underline}]{.mark} would [have negative [impact]{.mark} in
[**other areas**. **Rep**]{.mark}utation [was **not
compartmentalized**]{.mark}]{.underline} in different regions, in large
measure because the rival, the Soviet Union, was one and the same across
the world map. Hence "we tell the Soviets that we have to react here
because, if we did not, they would not believe us when we say that we
will react there. "31 [Academics]{.underline} have relentlessly
[questioned this argument, resulting in]{.underline} copious [writings
asserting that reputation is not interdependent and]{.underline},
according to some, [does not even matter]{.underline}.32 Reputation is
merely a cult and does not exist in international relations.33 Policy
makers, however, disagree and continue to speak of reputation for
resolve and reliability as something that not only matters and requires
constant work but also is interdependent. They prefer to rely on time-
tested authors, from Thucydides to Machiavelli, who consider reputation
as indispensable to political power.34 In brief, there is a deep gap
between academics and policy makers on the issue of reputation.

[By observing recent [events in]{.mark} the three frontier regions---
**Central [Europe]{.mark}**, the **Middle East**, and **East Asia**---
we think that the truth is closer to Schelling's view. It is clear that
the effects of probing behavior **[do not remain confined]{.mark}** to
the immediate actors involved]{.underline} (the probing power, the
direct target--- usually a rival's ally--- and the rival great power).
**[Other actors]{.underline}** in the region [are **keenly aware** of
the]{.underline} revisionist state's probing and of the [responses of
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. For instance,
other states, from the Baltics to Poland and Ukraine, observed Russia's
war against Georgia in 2008 and its invasion of Crimea in 2014 with
great trepidation.35 These wars were symptoms of a more assertive
Russia; a source of worry in themselves. But they were also meant to
elicit an answer from the United States. [[**Any sign** of]{.mark}
**American [hesitation]{.mark}**]{.underline} to respond quickly and
firmly to Russian small wars in the two states [[was **perceived** as
affecting]{.mark} directly]{.underline} these [[**other states**,
**not** directly involved]{.underline}]{.mark} in the probing event.
[America's **reputation** for **reliability**, in other words, was at
stake]{.underline}, even though Georgia and Ukraine were not NATO
members but only aspiring to closer security and political relations
with the United States and the EU. Similarly, Pacific nations from Japan
to Australia follow with great attention China's probing behavior in the
South China Sea that puts pressure on Vietnam, the Philippines, and
Taiwan. They too seek to figure out whether the United States has the
will to remain as a security provider in this region and to the "global
commons" in general. How the United States responds to a probe in a
particular region therefore affects its regional image.

The question is whether [[there is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[a
**wider**]{.mark}**, global [audience]{.mark}** to **regional
probes**]{.underline}. Do **[[Middle East]{.mark}ern [leaders
watch]{.mark} American responses to Russia's probing in Eastern
[Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}**? Do Kremlin elites draw lessons from U.S.
actions along the "first chain of islands" in East Asia? Or, do Chinese
neo- Mahanian leaders think the United States is on the wane if it
accommodates Putin's imperial fantasies? According to the latest
academic literature, the answer should be negative: how the United
States is perceived to be doing in one region does not translate into a
similar perception elsewhere. The practical implication of such a view
is that the United States should not have fought in Vietnam to prove
that it would stand its ground in Europe; similarly, it ought not to
oppose Putin around the Black Sea basin simply to demonstrate that it
will oppose China in the South China Sea. But we are not so confident
that [there are]{.underline} no [**connections** between regional
demonstrations of will and power]{.underline}. It is at least plausible,
and perhaps safer, to argue that [there are **wider, global
effects**]{.underline} of probing. First, [the world is]{.underline}
indeed [**global**, and [regions are **not hermetically
separated**]{.mark} from each other]{.underline}. As Nicholas Spykman
observed, "[Global war]{.underline}, as well as global peace, [means
that **all fronts**]{.underline} and all areas [are
**interrelated**]{.underline}. No matter how remote they are from each
other, [**success or [failure in one]{.mark}** will [have]{.mark} an
**immediate and determining [effect]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the
**[others]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is necessary, therefore, to see the
world as a whole and to weigh the measures taken to achieve victory in
the light of conditions in all theaters. "36 [[Leaders]{.mark} **watch**
and [**learn** from **other regions**]{.mark}, more than previously in
history when conflicts were limited by technology and geographic
knowledge to a contiguous region]{.underline}. Because of their domestic
opacity, it is difficult to prove that America's rivals learn from U.S.
behavior in other regions, but the question whether they do so needs to
be asked. Chinese military officials, for example, have commented
publicly on lessons for China from the U.S. handling of the war in
Ukraine.37 As one analyst noted, "It might be impossible to determine
definitively whether the **[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** Crisis has
[[impacted **China's**]{.mark} risk [calculus in]{.mark} **hotspots**
such as [the **S**]{.mark}**outh [and E]{.mark}ast [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea**]{.underline}, but the evidence . . . certainly suggests
that such eastern reverberations are quite plausible. "38 At a minimum
we have to recognize that some [[**cross- regional**
analyses]{.underline}]{.mark} do **[[occur]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
it is safer to assume that the [U.S. reputation does **not stay
limited** to a region]{.underline}.

Second, [[the]{.mark} much **[strong]{.mark}**er [effect]{.mark} of
probing [appears to be on]{.mark} U.S. **[allies]{.mark}** and friends,
[the **key**]{.mark} **geopolitical [spectators]{.mark}**[. They
**watch** how]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[treats **other allies** and form an
**opinion** regarding]{.mark} American
[reliability]{.mark}]{.underline}. The former director of Saudi
intelligence summed up the view of many [officials from]{.underline}
U.S. allied [states in the **Persian Gulf**]{.underline} when he said in
**[react]{.underline}**ion [to]{.underline} the Russian seizure of
**[Crimea]{.underline}**, "While the wolf is eating the sheep, there is
no shepherd to come to the rescue. "39 [Israel was interested in the war
in Georgia; **[Japan]{.mark}**]{.underline}ese analysts
[[followed]{.mark} the]{.underline} Obama [administration's decision to
cancel]{.underline} the Ballistic Missile Defense ([BMD]{.underline})
program [in [Central Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}; and Polish experts
watch U.S. moves in East Asia.40 The probing by revisionist states is
first and foremost an attempt to test the strength of their rival's
commitment to its allies and friends. In sum, probing behavior by
revisionist states targets these specific audiences in order to elicit
responses from them. The goal is to figure out whether and how to draw
the new map of power. And it puts the burden on the targeted audiences:
their responses determine whether the probe is successful.

EVALUATION OF PROBING: SUCCESS OR FAILURE

From the perspective of the revisionist power that engages in probing,
whether a probe has achieved its objectives determines its success or
failure. The minimum objective of the probing state is to measure the
rival's staying power in its neighboring region, an objective that is
achieved whether the targeted powers respond or not, but it is difficult
to interpret. The targeted rival may be tempted to ignore the probe not
out of a sense of its own weakness but in the belief that ignoring the
test will send a signal of strategic insouciance from its pedestal of
power. Also, because of the local and limited nature of a probe,
directly involving only the regional actors, it is tempting for the
distant security provider to leave the response to its allies and
friends. A direct and strong intervention by the offshore patron would
escalate the interaction, raising the chances of a larger war, an
outcome that neither party desires. But the shrewdness of a probing
strategy is that it puts the targeted rival power in the position of
having either to escalate the tensions in order to respond or to choose
a less confrontational approach but one that risks weakening its
alliances. The response to the probe, not the probe itself, is perceived
as a potential cause of war. This creates strong disincentives for the
tested great power to react by opposing the revisionist state's probe in
a direct and forceful way, or to respond at all. For instance, in the
case of China's probing actions in the South China Sea, the Obama
administration's approach seems to have been to accommodate Beijing,
acknowledging a decline in U.S. naval capabilities and welcoming a
greater Chinese role in providing security to the global commons.41
Similarly, after Russia's takeover of Crimea, Washington's first
response was to turn the episode into a strictly regional affair. As
President Obama put it in February 2014, "Any violation of Ukraine's
sovereignty and territorial integrity would be deeply destabilizing,
which is not in the interest of Ukraine, Russia, or Europe, " tellingly
not including the United States in the list of the affected parties.42

The problem is that the temptation of the existing great power to either
ignore or regionalize the tension stemming from the revisionist state's
probes--- an attempt to de- escalate the strategic interaction--- also
constitutes a response. It may, however, be one that serves for the
revisionist power as a confirmation of its initial suspicion that the
rival's commitment to the region was on the wane. [An
**unanswered**]{.underline}--- ignored or regionalized--- [probe is an
indication that the]{.underline} existing [map of power is **open to
revisions**]{.underline}. Another way to put this is that a probe is a
question of sorts: does the existing hegemon have the will and capacity
to oppose the revisionist power? An attempt to dismiss the question or
to let allies respond to it is a tacit admission by the tested great
power that its interest in maintaining a strong foothold and influence
in the region is in decline. Silence in response to a probe is telling.
Probing, therefore, always elicits some sort of answer, and in this
narrow sense it is a success.

The purpose of a probe is also to attain a secondary, albeit crucial,
goal of beginning to redraw the map of influence without generating
counterbalancing pressures from the tested great power and its allies.
The most successful probe would be one that pushes the targeted small
states and other regional spectators closer to the revisionist power (or
at least convinces them to distance themselves from their existing
security patron, the rival great power) while at the same time
convincing the rival great power that it is too costly to maintain its
political influence and provide security in the region. Hence the probe
needs to be evaluated on what it achieves in the three audiences: the
directly targeted neighboring small state, the distant security patron,
and the geopolitical onlookers (in particular other states in the
region). The success or failure of a revisionist state's probe depends
on the actions by these three groups, and, arguably, it can attain
partial success by achieving a revision of the status quo in one
audience but not the other.

For instance, a probe can succeed in extending the revisionist power's
influence over the immediate target, the ally or would- be ally of the
rival, but at the same time it may generate more vigorous efforts by
regional onlookers to counterbalance it through a variety of strategies,
ranging from military modernization to tighter defense cooperation with
the distant security patron. This seems to be the case for Russia's
takeover of Crimea. Moscow quickly conquered Crimea and destabilized
Ukraine's easternmost oblast, successfully demonstrating its ability and
willingness to use force to achieve limited territorial adjustments.
While Kiev maintains its political independence, it has also been shown
to be weak and unable to oppose Russian pressures. The quasi-- civil war
in the eastern regions and Russia's conquest of Crimea make Ukraine an
unlikely candidate for a closer relationship with the EU and NATO, even
if Ukrainian political elites and public opinion may continue to be in
favor of it. Russia's probe, in the form of its intervention in Crimea
and eastern Ukraine, has thus been successful in neutering the westward
drift of Kiev. The EU, and in particular states such as France and
Germany, have now an even smaller desire to bring Ukraine closer, as it
is deemed too dangerous and risky; Ukraine is not worth losing business
deals with Russia, not to mention starting a war with Russia.

The Ukraine War has also damaged American credibility in the region.
Washington after all had given assurances (not "guarantees, " which are
reserved for NATO members) to the Ukrainian government in the Budapest
Memorandum of 1994. This is undoubtedly a Russian success. But there are
also other consequences of Russia's probing, unintended and unwelcome by
Moscow. Some states in the Central European region, in particular Poland
and the Baltic states, have awakened from the geopolitical vacation of
the past two decades. The 1990s and the 2000s were characterized by a
widespread sense that threats to the territorial security of the region
were minimal, and most of the strategic focus was on economic
cooperation with the EU and on keeping in the good graces of the United
States through participation in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is
over, at least in part. While strengthening the EU continues to be a
priority in Central European capitals, there is simply no more interest
in "out- of- area" operations, which drain resources and time from
territorial defense. From this perspective, Russian probes have altered
the geostrategic outlook of some Central European states. The eastern
frontier is what really matters to them now, as their threat assessment
has changed. Russia, in other words, has reached an upper threshold in
its probes, creating a backlash among some of the states in the region,
which are pursuing diplomatic counterbalancing and defense
modernization. They are also calling for more visible and permanent NATO
(and in particular, U.S.) security presence on their territories to
shore up the extended deterrent against Russia.

It appears therefore that Russia is less successful than the other
revisionist power, China. [[Moscow is less subtle]{.mark} in its
probes]{.underline}, choosing dramatic military interventions (Georgia
and Crimea) that generate growing fear and opposition among some
European states as well as the United States. In part Moscow's more
aggressive behavior is a result of a Russian assessment of the weakness
and divisions of the West. But in part the seeming Russian rush to
restore influence over its "near neighborhood" is due to internal
demographic, economic, and political problems. The growing weakness of
Russia, [[a great power]{.underline}]{.mark} more by courtesy and [[by
**nuclear weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark} than by economic and political
strength, gives little time to Putin to shore up his country's position
facing China's rapid economic growth and Europe's political appeal. It
is a short- term approach of large probes, and it may be successful only
by extending influence over its most immediate nearby target.43

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, may have a different
time frame, allowing it to probe in a much more indirect and less
violent way, though this could change in the months ahead. It
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore more careful and [guarded,
[pursuing]{.mark}]{.underline} a long- term strategy of small [[probes
over]{.underline}]{.mark}, quite literally, small rocks in [the
**[S]{.mark}**]{.underline}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea. The U.S. "pivot" or "rebalancing" to
Asia makes American presence and resolve more pronounced, increasing the
doubt of a U.S. retrenchment and thus, from China's perspective, the
need to be cautious in testing the limits of American influence and
commitment. Moreover, the counterbalancing efforts of regional
onlookers, from Japan to the Philippines and Vietnam, are increasing in
intensity, in both the rhetoric used and the arms buildup. Similarly,
unlike Russia in Crimea, Beijing has not succeeded in extending its
direct control over a large piece of real estate. But in the end it may
be more successful, because it is establishing a gradual change in the
map of power, visible only after a decade- long period. Through its
probes, China is pursuing a classic example of "salami tactics. " As
Thomas Schelling describes them, "If there is no sharp qualitative
division between a minor transgression and a major affront, but a
continuous gradation of activity, one can begin his intrusion on a scale
too small to provoke a reaction, and increase it by imperceptible
degrees, never quite presenting a sud den, dramatic challenge that would
invoke the committed response. "44 Many small probes into areas of
contested influence do not individually invite a strong response, but
they erode steadily the perception and in the end the reality of the
opponent's influence.

Moreover, a continuing sequence of gradual probes signals the
seriousness of the revisionist's intent to alter the status quo. In the
mind of the hegemon, the steady drumbeat of low- intensity and
peripheral incidents creates the impression that the revisionist both
has special claims for and may someday be willing to fight over a
particular piece of real estate. These claims are often backed up by
legal, historical, or ethnic justifications and a creeping physical
presence--- in Ukraine, Russian forces and equipment; in the South China
Sea, artificially created reefs. Over time, this places the onus of a
response on the shoulders of the hegemon and its allies in the region
for why the status quo should be maintained. For a weary hegemon like
the United States today, probes communicate that the act of supporting
the regional status quo is no longer cost free but will require a level
of exertion that was not needed in the past, inevitably leading to
questions of whether such effort and resulting escalation are
worthwhile.

Nonetheless, it is certainly possible to see failed instances of
probing, which achieve the opposite of the revisionist power's
intentions. The historic scorecard of probing states is mixed. A clear
failure of probing would be if the targeted regional states and offshore
security patron responded strongly, tightening their alliance and even
initiating a direct **[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This [[is
**a**]{.mark}n **unintended [consequence]{.mark}**]{.underline} of a
probe [and can take several forms]{.underline}, from a tightening of
alliances countering the revisionist power to increased military
contingency planning and rearming. In the worst- case scenario, [it
results in a combination of actions that **counterbalance**]{.underline}
the revisionist state more effectively and forcefully than before the
probing behavior started. The revisionist state did not want nor expect
this response before engaging in probing. It amounts to a
disconfirmation of the initial hypothesis that the rival great power is
in decline and retreat, and in the end it worsens the strategic position
of the probing state.

The biggest loser may thus be the probing power, which puts in motion a
series of strategic interactions that undermine its own strength. This
was the case of Germany in the early twentieth century. Kaiser Wilhelm's
visit to Tangier in 1905 initiated the first Moroccan crisis,
manufactured by Berlin to, among other objectives, probe the strength of
the brand new and untested Franco- British Entente Cordiale. 45 By
challenging French interests in Morocco in a nonviolent way, Berlin
wanted to pressure Paris, "the weakest link in the surrounding chain" of
states opposing Germany.46 But it desired to do that in an area and in a
way that were expected not to draw Great Britain into a direct
confrontation, so that Germany could demonstrate to Paris that the
entente was in effect useless. Morocco was important to France but not
to Great Britain, and the German Foreign Office expected that London
would not back Paris. Great Britain after all was also seen as
retrenching after a bloody war with the Boers and unable and unwilling
to project power on land to guarantee the security of its French quasi-
ally. As Friedrich von Holstein put it, the French would seek a
rapprochement with Germany, in effect bandwagoning, "when they have seen
that English friendship . . . is not enough to gain Germany's agreement
to the French seizure of Morocco, but rather that Germany wishes to be
loved on its own account. "47 Germany, however, greatly miscalculated
the British need for a continental ally and resulting commitment to
France. The Moroccan crisis was resolved in a multilateral conference in
Algeciras where Berlin ended in a position that was considerably worse
than before the crisis: its only support was from the weak Austro-
Hungarian Empire, while London was firmly and actively on the side of
Paris. Instead of weakening the nascent strategic friendship between
Britain and France, "German bullying" strengthened it.48 From then on,
the "European Balance of Power, which had been ignored for forty years,
again dominated British foreign policy; and henceforth every German move
was interpreted as a bid for continental hegemony. "49 London reoriented
its attention away from the empire and toward the European continent,
gradually planning to ready an expeditionary force to come to France's
defense.50 Berlin's probe in Morocco turned into a clear failure.51

Probing is low risk, insofar as it is tailored to minimize a strong
reaction of the rival, but it is not danger free for the revisionist
state. Despite the fact that it arises out of a desire to clarify an
allegedly new map of power, the effects of probing are difficult to
interpret. [All [parties]{.mark} involved]{.underline}--- the
revisionist power and the targeted states--- [[can
**miscalc**]{.mark}**ulate**]{.underline} their reactions. In a case of
moral hazard, the [smaller states]{.underline}, directly targeted by the
revisionist power, may respond violently to the low- intensity probe,
feeling secure thanks to the alliance with a more powerful patron. Or,
[[sensing]{.mark} that [their]{.mark} distant [patron is no longer
capable]{.mark} of maintaining]{.underline} its [[influence]{.mark},
they may decide]{.underline} the exact opposite [and accept the hegemony
of the rival]{.underline}. This was the case of Athenian allies in
Thrace, switching sides under General Brasidas's pressure and
persuasion. They were mistaken because their "judg ment was based more
upon blind wishing than upon any sound prediction. "52 Athens rallied
and sent large forces north to restore its sway.

[The probing power can]{.underline} also be the one to
**[miscalculate]{.underline}**, either not seeing the success or
ignoring the failure. The nature of probing is such that the effects are
often not visible immediately and require time to alter the perceptions
and realities of power. The episode of Spartan commander Brasidas is
again telling. Sparta did not follow up on his successes, in part
because Spartan kings were jealous of his military exploits, but in part
because they thought the damage inflicted on Athens was sufficient to
strike a deal and end the war.53 They were of course wrong, as the war
continued for decades. Alternatively, despite being checked, the probing
power may simply up the ante, seeking some gain. This may have been the
case of Germany, which did not stop challenging France and Britain after
1905, despite its diplomatic isolation, the military conundrum of a two-
front war, and a robust Franco- British entente. In brief, there is no
easy single interpretation of a probe and its effects.

[A related risk is]{.underline} that a probe may lead [to an unintended
and untimely **escalation**]{.underline} of the strategic rivalry. As we
described, the purpose of probing is to see how permissive the
geopolitical order is, and to that goal a probe is limited in geographic
reach and means used. It targets an issue presumed peripheral to the
rival great power, seeking, for instance, a small territorial adjustment
that is costly to the weaker neighboring state but not deemed worthy of
a direct conflict by the distant and more powerful security patron. But
the limited nature of the probe is somewhat at odds with its ultimate
purpose to check the limits of an allegedly declining rival great power.
A probe is a low- intensity, local pinprick with wider repercussions;
limited geographically yet potentially global in outcome. The probing
state has a strong interest in keeping the crisis limited and circum
scribed to the narrowly defined area, but it is also poking the rival
great pow er to see what the reaction may be. It is banking on the fact
that the probe is on the periphery of the rival's influence and
interests, and thus that the rival will not escalate the interaction.
The probing challenger, in other words, is betting that its great power
rival will fear entrapment, being involved in an undesirable conflict,
more than loss of prestige, reputation, or influence. The revisionist
power seeks to use the fact of alliances (which it lacks itself) as a
source of competitive disadvantage for the hegemon. This is based on two
reinforcing perceptions--- first, that the commitment involved in their
maintenance is an encumbrance depriving the hegemon of strategic
flexibility; and second, that the hegemon's temptation to devalue its
own alliances suggests that it feels the weight of this encumbrance.

Probes therefore arise from a view that entrapment is the congenital
flaw of alliances. They are the ultimate act of attempting to expose the
dangers of entrapment to hegemon and ally alike. This is ultimately a
gamble--- an expectation, not a certainty. And [the gamble can
**backfire**]{.underline}, as there is always the possibility that [[a
probe]{.mark} will [result in a **dramatic escalation**]{.mark} since it
is targeted at **multiple audiences**]{.underline}. There is thus a
clear recognition that a probe has a much wider purpose than its
immediate action may convey, and consequently the desire to keep it
limited runs against the desire to have a much larger demonstrative
effect. As a result, [the interaction a probe initiates has an
**inherent risk** of **escalating** into a **much larger
confrontation**]{.underline}.54

The revisionist state neither desires nor expects the escalation, but
its possibility and perhaps likelihood are a direct outcome of probing.
A probe by definition crosses a limit, a tacit or an explicit line of
influence, in the expectation that it no longer reflects the actual will
and power of the rival state. The revisionist power tests limits that
until then were accepted and unchallenged and takes the first step in an
"escalatory ladder" of competitive behavior. For instance, Kaiser
Wilhelm's support of Boer independence in 1896 was a test of British
strength in what Berlin wrongly thought was a peripher al area of the
British Empire. Similarly, the Moroccan crisis in 1905 was a test of
British commitment to France in a region that should have been of no
importance to London. Both, however, were a "move in the European
Balance of Power, " and that, beyond the details of the individual
probes, was becoming of paramount concern to Great Britain. 55 Both were
met by a strong British response, intensifying the Anglo- British
rivalry. Escalation here was a willful choice of the targeted power.

Finally, probing can be in many cases a violent act, raising even
further the likelihood of escalation and war. Probing is a political act
first and foremost, only at times pursued by military means, but it does
involve a careful application of violence or threat of violence. This
requires strict political control, which is easier to maintain if the
probe is not militarized and violent. But the more violent it becomes,
the more difficult it is to keep it under political control. The logic
of war may overwhelm the political rationale. Bismarck was keenly aware
that the limited wars he fought, such as the Franco- Prussian one in
1870, would result in political outcomes that were different from his
objectives were other great powers to become involved. But his greatest
obstacle was the German military, resentful of civilian interference in
what they deemed to be affairs in their exclusive purview. Political
control over a limited war is paramount, because otherwise operational
war objectives can overwhelm the larger political goals.56 The fact that
Russia and China probe through a variety of nontraditional means, such
as fishing vessels in the South China Sea and specially formed
battalions (Vostok) of Chechens, makes political control more difficult.
There is an incentive to use such means in a more aggressive way than
would be warranted by official state forces, because in case of defeat
one can always deny control over them and claim that they are simply
individual citizens. Moreover, the "civilian" paramilitary forces that
the probing power uses (e.g., the "Russian separatists" in eastern
Ukraine) may not be easily recalled if the conflict ceases to be useful.
The civilianization of conflict has its own risks. This makes probing
behavior inherently destabilizing to an international order, as it sets
forces in motion that, once unleashed, can be hard to control.

[Probing can]{.underline}, moreover, [**spiral** into
**war**]{.underline}, unexpected and perhaps unwanted by the revisionist
power. For instance, in the third century BC, Rome started to probe
Carthaginian power in Sicily. It extended protection to Messana (or,
more precisely, to a band of mercenaries, the Mamertines, who controlled
it), thereby asserting Roman influence in northern Sicily. The peaceful
withdrawal of the Punic garrison from the area seemed to suggest that a
war was avoidable and the probe successful in attaining a low- cost
revision to the balance of power. But the Romans miscalculated and were
emboldened by this small success. As Polybius put it, they "now
cherished the hope that they could drive the Carthaginians out of Sicily
altogether, and that once this goal was attained their own power would
be greatly increased. "57 Carthage sent a large force to Sicily and
solidified its alliance with Syracuse against Rome and its new ally
Messana. Rome then escalated and sent a large army to besiege Syracuse,
starting the first Punic war, which lasted more than twenty years.58
What started as a low- cost, low- risk probe turned into a long and
costly slugfest. To sum up, the risk of probing is that it may result in
a slide toward a direct clash. [**[Miscalc]{.mark}ulation** [and
**escalation**]{.mark} by all parties involved can
**[elevate]{.mark}**]{.underline} what is [[a small]{.mark}, localized
[harassment into a **wider**]{.mark}**, more violent
[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, a pattern of probing may
gradually lead all sides to accept war as necessary and perhaps
inevitable, as each probe and reaction escalates the competitive
interaction.

Cold Shoulder", Washington Times, 11/25/2019,

President Trump on Monday hosted the prime minister of Bulgaria, the
latest in a string of **[[Eastern Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**an
leaders who've [[found **common ground** with]{.underline}]{.mark} an
unconventional **[[America]{.underline}]{.mark}**n president looking to
tap business opportunities and one-up his predecessor.

Seated close enough to whisper, Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Boyko
Borissov discussed the purchase of eight F-16 fighter jets from the U.S.
and efforts to ease travel between the nations through visa reform.

"We're gonna work on that problem," Mr. Trump said as news cameras
clicked away in the Oval Office.

[The president's [stances on **climate**]{.mark}, **multinational
[agreements]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **defense [spending]{.mark}** have
[struck a]{.mark} **discordant [note]{.mark}** [with **Western**]{.mark}

Besides Bulgaria, [he's [welcomed]{.mark} leaders from the

**Slovakia**]{.mark} to the White House **this year**, and]{.underline}
he [dispatched]{.underline} Vice President Mike [Pence to
Warsaw]{.underline} after hosting Polish President Andrzej Duda and his
wife in June.

Analysts say Mr. Trump sees a business opportunity with European leaders
who cherish America and felt ignored by President Barack Obama, yet risk
falling under the influence of Russia or China. There's also a natural
kinship between these leaders' styles and Mr. Trump's own.

"[[They are **nationalist**]{.mark} --- relative to Western
Europe]{.underline} --- and religious, and have a certain esprit de
corps that springs from that," said Peter Rough, a senior fellow at the
Hudson Institute in D.C.

Once tucked behind the Iron Curtain, the people in these nations have
fresh memories of the Cold War and relish their alliance with America.
[[They **view**]{.mark} **the [U.S. as]{.mark} a [protector]{.mark}**[,

[[U.S. **fo**]{.mark}reign **[po]{.mark}**licy [is, **by**]{.mark}
**most [accounts]{.mark}**[, in disarray.
**Headlines**]{.mark}]{.underline}---including in these
pages---[[proclaim]{.mark} the [**death** of]{.mark} global American
[leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}. Famous columnists send regular
dispatches from the frontlines of U.S. President Donald Trump's supposed
campaign against the postwar liberal order. [The damage to Washington's
standing in the world, we are told, is irreparable]{.underline}.

[[But **step back** from]{.mark} the [**day-to-day commotion**, and a
**different picture**]{.mark} emerges. [In truth]{.mark}, the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[is
**gearing up** for]{.underline}]{.mark} a new era---one marked not by
unchallenged U.S. dominance but by a rising China and a [vindictive
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} seeking to undermine U.S. leadership and
refashion global politics in their favor.

[This **shift**]{.underline} in Washington's focus [has been some time
coming]{.underline}. Elements of it emerged, mostly in a reactive form,
under President Barack Obama. The [Trump]{.underline} administration
[has gone]{.underline} one important step [further,
[recognizing]{.mark}]{.underline} that [**[great-power
competition]{.mark}** warrants rebuilding U.S. foreign policy from the
ground up]{.underline}, and it has based its formal strategy documents
on that recognition. When future historians look back at the actions of
the United States in the early twenty-first century, by far the most
consequential story will be the way Washington refocused its attention
on great-power competition. Beneath today's often ephemeral headlines,
it is this shift, and [the **[reordering]{.mark}** of U.S.]{.underline}
military, economic, and **[[diplomatic behavior]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that it entails, that [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} stand out---and
[likely [**drive** U.S.]{.mark} foreign [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}
under presidents from either party [[for a **long time**]{.mark} to
come]{.underline}.

THE COSTS OF INACTION

For years, American policymakers and analysts have argued about what
China's rise and Russia's resurgence mean for U.S. interests. Since
their introduction in the most recent National Security and National
Defense Strategies, the words "great-power competition" have circulated
widely enough to become a faddish catch phrase. But by now, the nature
of the challenge, as an empirical fact, should be clear: the United
States today faces rivals stronger and far more ambitious than at any
time in recent history. China---seeking hegemony in the Indo-Pacific
region first and global preeminence thereafter---is likely to become the
most powerful rival that the United States has ever faced in its
history. Russia may fall short of being a peer competitor but has proved
capable of projecting power in ways few anticipated at the close of the
Cold War. Today, it is intent on resurrecting its ascendancy in parts of
eastern Europe that once fell within its sphere of influence and hopes
to speed up the end of Western preeminence in the world at large. Its
disruptive potential lies in part in its ability, through
self-interested moves, to bring about systemic crises that will benefit
Chinese power in the long term.

Until recently, Washington was not giving much thought to how it could
meet these challenges. Such was the extent of the United States'
economic and military dominance that, for a whole generation following
the collapse of the Soviet Union, neither Democratic nor Republican
administrations took seriously the possibility of facing another peer
competitor. Great-power rivalries were, in those heady days, a thing of
the past; the very language of geopolitics was an anachronism. Other
major powers were instead partners in waiting in the fight to tackle
problems of the "global commons," from nuclear proliferation to
terrorism to climate change.

China's and Russia's actions slowly gave the lie to this sanguine
outlook. As China became pivotal to global commerce, it did not so much
change its discriminatory economic practices---forced technology
transfers, mandatory joint ventures, and outright intellectual property
theft---as cement them. It complemented this with a military buildup of
historic scale, aimed specifically at dominating Asia and, in the long
run, at projecting power throughout the world, and with a massive effort
to expand its influence through the Belt and Road Initiative and related
projects. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile, rebuilt its
military, [[invaded Georgia]{.mark}, annexed Crimea, initiated
a]{.underline} festering [insurgency in]{.underline} eastern
[Ukraine]{.underline}, and began a systematic campaign to resurrect its
military, economic, and diplomatic influence in Africa, Latin America,
and the Middle East.

[And [yet]{.mark}]{.underline} most people in
[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} long [refused to
acknowledge]{.underline} the new [reality. Instead, American leaders
[continued]{.mark} to herald]{.underline} an "era of
**[[engagement]{.mark}" with Moscow]{.underline}** and talked up
Beijing's potential as a "responsible stakeholder" in the international
system. [The former found expression in the **"reset"** with
Russia]{.underline} in 2009, just months after Moscow's invasion of
Georgia, and the latter took the form of repeated efforts to deepen
relations with Beijing and even an aspiration among some to establish a
U.S.-Chinese "G-2" to lead the international community.
[But]{.underline} China's brazen militarization of islets in the South
China Sea and its increasing assertiveness beyond eventually forced
Washington to reevaluate its assumptions about Beijing, and Russia's
seizure of Crimea in 2014 put to rest what was left of the so-called
reset. By the end of the Obama administration, [it was clear that the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [course was
**seriously off**]{.underline}.

The resulting policy changes were no exercise in American strategic
foresight; they were reactive, ex post facto adjustments. [Considerable
damage had already been done. Prizing the **appearance of stability**
over the pursuit of definable national interests]{.underline}, the
United States had for years ignored China's flagrant theft of U.S.
intellectual property---not to mention government secrets---and
Beijing's slow-motion takeover attempt in the South China Sea.
[[In]{.mark} the [hopes of **recruiting**]{.mark} **Russia as [a
partner]{.mark}**]{.underline} in upholding an international status quo
that Russian President Vladimir Putin manifestly disdained,
[[Washington]{.mark} had courted and unwittingly **[emboldened]{.mark}
the [Kremlin]{.mark}** on its path of territorial revision whi[le
**unnerving frontline**]{.mark} **NATO [allies]{.mark}** in eastern
Europe. The **cost** for the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [was **steep**, with allies in]{.underline}
East Asia and [Europe beginning to **doubt** that Washington was
**willing to stand up** for itself, let alone for them]{.underline}.

COURSE CORRECTIONS

[It was time to call a spade a spade]{.underline}. The
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration, [more realistic and
blunter]{.underline} than its predecessors, [did just that]{.underline}.
"Trump," as Henry Kissinger pointed out in the Financial Times in 2018,
"may be one of those figures in history who appears from time to time to
mark the end of an era and to force it to give up its old pretenses."
[Dispensing with the paradigm of unipolarity, the new government
[created]{.mark} an opening to articulate [a new]{.mark} grand
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the 2017 National Security Strategy,
the 2018 National Defense Strategy, and their ancillary regional
strategies for the Indo-Pacific and European theaters, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [made
clear]{.underline} that [it [now saw relations]{.mark} with]{.underline}
China and [Russia [as **competitive**]{.mark} and that it would
**focus** on **maintaining an edge** over these rivals]{.underline}. As
both then Secretary of Defense James Mattis and then National Security
Adviser H. R. McMaster made clear, [[**great-power competition**
would]{.mark} now [be the]{.mark} **primary [focus]{.mark}** of U.S.
national security]{.underline}.

[The idea]{.underline} behind this shift [is]{.underline} not to be
blindly confrontational but [to preserve]{.underline} what has been the
central objective of U.S. foreign policy since the end of World War II:
[the freedom of]{.underline} states, particularly [U.S. allies, to chart
their own courses without interference]{.underline} from a domineering
regional hegemon. As articulated in the Trump administration's strategy
statements, that vision is deliberately ecumenical: it applies both to
the Asian nations that find themselves under growing economic and
military pressure from Beijing and to the federating heart of the
European continent and the more loosely affiliated states on its
fringes. But faced with a rising and enormously powerful China and an
opportunistically vengeful Russia, the United States will realize this
vision of a free and open world only if it ensures its own strength and
economic vitality, maintains an edge in regional balances of power, and
communicates its interests and redlines clearly.

In many respects, the U.S. Department of Defense is the furthest along
in putting that agenda into practice. In its National Defense Strategy,
in its 2019 Indo-Pacific Strategy Report, and through its public
statements, the U.S. military has made clear that its overriding concern
today is how to effectively defend the likes of Taiwan and the Baltic
states against a potential Chinese or Russian attack, especially one
based on a fait accompli strategy, which involves seizing vulnerable
territory, digging in, and making any counterattack too costly to
envisage. In anticipation of such attacks, the Pentagon is shifting from
the playbook it has used ever since Operation Desert Storm three decades
ago---slowly and methodically surging forces to a threatened area and
only counterattacking after total U.S. dominance is assured---to a force
that can fend off Chinese and Russian attacks from the very beginning of
hostilities, even if it never attains the kind of dominance the United
States was once able to gain in such places as Serbia and Iraq. The
Pentagon's budget requests have slowly begun to shift accordingly.
Short-range fighter jets and bulky amphibious vessels, both vulnerable
to enemy attacks, are making way for stealthier long-range bombers and
submarines, unmanned ships and aircraft, long-range ground-based
missiles and artillery, and large stocks of precise, penetrating
munitions. The military is also experimenting with how to use this new
hardware---what the new force should look like, how it should operate,
and where.

The shift in the economic arena has been just as dramatic. Until a few
years ago, U.S. officials regularly argued that the United States could
not afford turbulence in the U.S.-Chinese economic relationship.
Stability with Beijing, it seemed, was too valuable to jeopardize by
demanding that U.S. companies be treated fairly. Today, the Trump
administration---acting with considerable bipartisan support---is
levying tariffs on Chinese imports to induce Beijing to cease its
market-distorting trade practices or, failing that, to at least have the
prices of those imports reflect the costs of those unfair practices for
U.S. companies and workers. Some have rightly pointed out that these
penalties are causing the United States' middle and working classes
pain. But so, too, have China's unfair trade practices, and further
inaction would have only made things worse. U.S. economic pressure, by
contrast, has helped put urgently needed trade policy adjustments on the
agenda.

A similar process has played out in Europe. The United States long
hesitated to confront the European Union about its one-sided tariff and
nontariff barriers against U.S. products, even as trade deficits
mounted. Unwilling to accept that status quo, the Trump administration
has tried to achieve by shock therapy what earlier successive
administrations failed to obtain with finesse and gradualism. But the
collateral damage of this aggressive approach has been significant, with
potential spillover effects for the transatlantic relationship that risk
undermining the common push against China.

In parallel, the United States is sharpening the powerful commercial
tools at its disposal. The Trump administration and Congress have
overhauled the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to provide
alternatives to Chinese financing among the vulnerable states of both
Asia and Europe. The Better Utilization of Investments Leading to
Development, or BUILD, Act, which passed in October 2018, offers
countries financing alternatives to the golden handcuffs of Beijing's
Belt and Road Initiative. More still may follow. The bipartisan
EQUITABLE Act, introduced by leading members of Congress, would require
Chinese companies to follow the same disclosure rules as U.S. firms do
to be listed on U.S. stock exchanges. Powerful legislators of both
parties have said they will revoke Hong Kong's economic and trading
privileges in the United States if Beijing violates its commitment to
the region's autonomy. And U.S. officials are, at long last, actively
warning other countries about Chinese telecommunications investments
that could offer Beijing access to, and leverage over, their sensitive
technologies.

Priorities have changed in the diplomatic arena, too. After decades of a
disproportionate focus on the Middle East, the 2017 National Security
Strategy and the 2018 National Defense Strategy came as long-overdue
correctives. Asia and Europe are where the greatest threats to U.S.
power today lie, the documents argue, and the United States' central
objective should be to keep large states in both regions from gaining so
much influence as to shift the local balance of power in their favor.
This is a welcome departure from every National Security Strategy since
the end of the Cold War, each of which downplayed major-power
competition in some way or another.

In practice, two diplomatic initiatives stand out. The first is the
Trump administration's effort to balance against powerful rivals with
the help of larger and more capable coalitions. In Europe, this yielded
\$34 billion in increased European defense spending in the past year
alone, even from a reluctant Germany. In Asia, the United States has
made clear that it will defend Philippine aircraft and vessels in the
South China Sea, has increased its diplomatic and military support for
Taiwan, and has deepened its political and military relations with India
and Vietnam---all counterparts that share Washington's apprehension
about Chinese aspirations to regional hegemony.

Second, [the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[is **leveraging its**]{.mark}
**economic and political [influence]{.mark}** in regions that it
neglected until recently, [ramping up]{.mark} its engagement and aid
in]{.underline} several [places where]{.underline} China and [Russia
have been gaining ground. It has **stepped up** its [**diplomatic
presence** in **central Europe**]{.mark}, the western Balkans, and the
eastern Mediterranean]{.underline}, where the vacuum left by an absent
United States allowed China and Russia to exploit local political
fissures and promote authoritarian politics. In several of the countries
in these regions, the United States has increased its support for good
governance and the fight against corruption, introduced initiatives to
counter Russian propaganda, expanded youth and cultural exchanges, and
warned allies and partners about the long-term risks of aligning with
Beijing and Moscow. In Asia, Washington has upped its development
capacities to compete with Beijing's by founding the International
Development Finance Corporation and making new financing available
through the BUILD Act. The United States is also promoting good
governance and anticorruption efforts in the region, particularly
through the Indo-Pacific Transparency Initiative, and is publicly
challenging China's treatment of its Tibetan and Uighur minorities. It
is also paying more attention to Pacific states such as Micronesia,
Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, which are particularly
susceptible to Chinese pressure.

None of this is to diminish the importance of the day-to-day turmoil in
Washington or to defend the administration's every policy. Engaging in a
war with Iran, sustaining a large military presence in Afghanistan, or
intervening in Venezuela, as some in the administration want to do, is
antithetical to success in a world of great-power competition. And if it
pushes its allies too far, Washington will risk undermining the single
greatest comparative advantage it has over its rivals. Nor is the United
States on course yet to compete successfully---on the contrary, the
progress thus far has been uneven and halting. Nonetheless, [the
[country]{.mark} now [has a **template** for **reorienting**]{.mark} its
**[fo]{.mark}**reign **[po]{.mark}**licy [that **enjoys bipartisan
support** and is **likely to endure**]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least in
its fundamental tenets, in future administrations.

70th anniversary. We should celebrate that [[NATO has been]{.mark} the
**most [successful]{.mark}** alliance of all time,
[preventing]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[major]{.mark} great-power
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}** such as World War I and World War II, during
which 15 to 20 million and 62 to 78 million people died, respectively.

In the context of NATO's success, we should review the criticisms of the
organization --- particularly burden-sharing.

It has been said that the United States is not "merely an Atlas to carry
the load on its shoulder" in the context of NATO burden-sharing and that
the United States "cannot continue to pay for the military protection of
Europe while the NATO states are not paying their fair share and living
off the 'fat of the land.'" It has also been stated that "America
believes if Europeans invest in their own defense, they will also be
stronger and more capable when we deploy together" and that "everybody's
got to chip in" to NATO. These quotes were spoken by President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, President John F. Kennedy, President George W. Bush, and
President Barack Obama, respectively.

Clearly, the criticisms of burden-sharing are not new and must be taken
in a historical context. As U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison
recently stated, "in my 20 years in the Senate, every President with
whom I worked also asked our allies to step up, and our allies have been
very forthcoming."

President [[Trump]{.mark} has made]{.underline} some vocal
[criticisms]{.underline} of NATO during the campaign and as president.
[He even discussed]{.underline} the terrifying possibility of [a U.S.
withdrawal]{.underline} from the alliance. [But he
**[reaffirmed]{.mark}** the U.S. [commitment]{.mark} to NATO's mutual
defense article, [and]{.mark} his **[admin]{.mark}**istration [is
**clearly in favor**]{.mark} of remaining in the organization. This is
reflected in the]{.underline} administration's
**[N]{.underline}**ational **[S]{.underline}**ecurity
**[S]{.underline}**trategy, which states that the "NATO alliance will
become stronger when all members assume greater responsibility for and
pay their fair share to protect our mutual interests, sovereignty, and
values" and reiterates the United States' expectation that European
allies spend 2 percent of GDP on defense by 2024.

The 2 percent target is imperfect and has received some legitimate
criticisms, but it is a simple metric to measure burden-sharing.
President Carter first introduced the idea of a non-binding
burden-sharing measurement in 1977, when he suggested that member states
increase defense-related expenditure by 3 percent annually. The 2
percent threshold idea arose as a "gentlemen's agreement" during the
2002 Prague Summit. Member states reiterated their commitment to try to
meet the 2 percent target in the 2006 Riga Summit, and they officially
endorsed the target at the 2014 Wales Summit.

Within the alliance, [[burden-sharing concerns have **not** gone
unheard]{.mark}, and **member [states are doing
more]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While only a minority of countries
currently meet the 2 percent target, [seven countries]{.underline}
(United States, Greece, United Kingdom, [Estonia, Poland, Latvia, and
Lithuania) met the goal in 2018 --- a considerable increase from just
three countries four years earlier]{.underline}.

[Defense [expenditure reached a]{.mark} **six-year [high]{.mark}** of
\$919 billion in 2018]{.underline} [--- [boosted by a **considerable
increase**]{.mark} in defense spending by **Europe**]{.underline}an
countries and Canada to a total of \$313 billion. Moreover, while some
countries do not reach the 2 percent goal, they spend their defense
budgets wisely. For example, France spent an estimated \$51 billion ---
around 1.82 percent of GDP --- on defense in 2018. And yet, France has
the third-highest number of military personnel within NATO and the
third-highest number of forces deployed abroad in the world, both after
the United States and Turkey. [This exemplifies that NATO allies are
**actively increasing** their defense spending]{.underline}, investing
it wisely, and working to maintain a credible conventional deterrent,
even if they do not reach the 2 percent target.

[The **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[remains **strongly committed**]{.mark} to NATO]{.underline}. President
[[Trump]{.mark} recently [said]{.mark}]{.underline} that
["[we're]{.mark} going to be [with]{.mark} NATO **[100
percent]{.mark}**."]{.underline} Even if there were a change in
administration in 2020, the United States will continue to support NATO,
as the 2016 Democratic Party Platform reaffirmed the Party's commitment
to NATO and also called for other member states to contribute their fair
share. Among top Democrats, Joe Biden strongly supports NATO and
Elizabeth Warren has also expressed support.

One must ask: has NATO been successful? The answer can be measured by
what has not happened. There has been no great power war since World War
II. No NATO member states have developed nuclear weapons (other than the
United States, the United Kingdom, and France). NATO is also active on
the ground, leading operations in Afghanistan, Kosovo, and the
Mediterranean and supporting the African Union and a training mission in
Iraq.

Moreover, a large number of countries still seek NATO membership, with
the last country to join being Montenegro in 2017. Bosnia and
Herzegovina and North Macedonia currently participate in the Membership
Action Plan, an assistance program for countries who wish to join.
Georgia and Ukraine also aspire to join. These actions signal that NATO
is still strong and relevant.

Trump's tough and persistent stance on increased burden-sharing is
consistent with past administrations. This administration's criticisms
have been heard by NATO members, who are actively seeking to increase
their defense spending even if they do not reach the 2 percent
benchmark. [**Major wars have been avoided** thanks to
NATO]{.underline}, and the United States remains committed to the
alliance. [[NATO is **strong** and **growing**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### NATO's [strong]{.underline} with [robust]{.underline} contributions by the U.S. and allies

Lt. Col. Tony **Shaffer 19**, Retired Senior Intelligence Operations
Officer and Acting President of the London Center for Policy Research,
"NATO Is Now Stronger Than Ever", The Epoch Times, 2/6/2019,
https://www.theepochtimes.com/nato-is-now-stronger-than-ever_2789914.html

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization [[(NATO) is]{.mark} now
[**stronger than ever**. What was a]{.mark} Cold War [relic is]{.mark}
now [returned]{.mark} to service [with **renewed vigor**]{.mark} **and
teeth**]{.underline}.

Take it from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg himself, who said
that President [[Trump's pressure]{.mark} on]{.underline} European
[allies to meet]{.underline} their military [funding commitments has
[had **"real results."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

"President Donald Trump is having an impact," Stoltenberg told Fox News
in a Sunday morning interview. In all, Stoltenberg continued, "by the
end of next year, NATO allies will add \$100 billion extra toward
defense. So we see some real money and some real results. And we see
that the clear message from President Donald Trump is having an impact."

When [asked if he was **[concern]{.mark}**ed that]{.underline} President
[Trump's tough [rhetoric might]{.mark} be "helping Putin
**[splinter]{.mark}** NATO," Stoltenberg said [the **exact opposite** is
happening]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[What I see is that actually [NATO is **united**]{.mark} because [we
are able to]{.mark} adapt to **[deliver]{.mark}**]{.underline}," he
explained. "[North America and Europe are [doing **more**]{.mark}
together now [than before]{.mark}]{.underline}."

For context, U.S. defense spending amounted to just under \$686 billion
in 2017, equating to 3.6 percent of GDP. By comparison, Germany spent
around \$45 billion on its armed forces last year, or 1.2 percent of
GDP.

For years, our NATO allies in Europe have shortchanged the system and
relied on the United States to foot most of the bill for our mutual
defense, but President Trump shocked the elites of Washington and
Brussels by demanding that those countries actually meet their pledges
to spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense.

President Trump declared during the 2018 NATO summit that the United
States will no longer tolerate other member states spending only a
little more than 1 percent of their GDP on defense while the United
States "in actual numbers is paying 4.2 percent of a much larger GDP,"
saying this is not fair to U.S. taxpayers and "we're not going to put up
with it."

[[While some]{.mark} European diplomats [**initially** reacted]{.mark}
to the President's pronouncement [with outrage, it's **now**]{.mark}
clear that his strategy is **[bearing fruit]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The biggest loser in all this is Russia---a country that spent just
\$66.3 billion on defense in 2017, a 17 percent decline from the
previous year and the first year-over-year drop since 1998.

That means the \$100 billion in new defense spending promised by our
NATO allies in Europe is nearly double that of Russia's entire 2017
budget.

President [Trump is an effective negotiator]{.underline}---proof's in
the pudding so to speak. Despite political criticism (most of it free of
facts) both at home and abroad, his [[insistence]{.mark}
that]{.underline} our [[allies meet]{.mark} their [spending
commitments]{.mark} has [made NATO **stronger**]{.mark} than it's been
for years]{.underline}.

Spare a thought for NATO officials and diplomats. They have spent the
last six months preparing a summit that could be rendered irrelevant in
a matter of days. It's not that the meeting --- focused on new measures
to reinforce Europe in a crisis --- is unimportant. [The [fear

These [**biases** have **important implications** for alliance politics.
[Allies]{.mark} are likely to [see]{.mark} U.S. [actions as]{.mark} the
**[willful choices]{.mark}** of the U.S. government, rather than
attributing them to domestic or international constraints. For example,
foreign observers will]{.underline} tend to [see **policymaking
volatility** as evidence of Trump]{.underline} administration
[**deliberately cultivating uncertainty** rather than as the result of
bureaucratic infighting or incompetence]{.underline}. Similarly,
[[allies]{.mark} may]{.underline} tend toward
**[[interpret]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [**any [omission]{.mark}** of
efforts to reinforce an alliance [as a **deliberate**]{.mark} strategic
[choice to **undermine**]{.mark} an [alliance]{.mark} such [as
with]{.mark}]{.underline} Trump's [[reluctance to]{.mark} publicly
[commit to]{.mark}]{.underline} NATO's **[[Article
5]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These dynamics only serve to decrease trust,
and increase the damage that can be caused to alliances, even by "cheap"
talk.

Redefining the Norms of Exchange

Since the campaign trail, Trump has frequently indicated a desire to
recast the U.S. relationship with its historical partners. He has
threatened to withdraw U.S. forces from Japan unless Japan started
paying for all of the costs, has alleged that Germany owed NATO "vast
sums of money," and so on. Although it is not unusual for U.S. officials
to complain about free riding (which, as discussed above, is a perennial
concern within alliance relationships), American alliances seem to
currently be understood in a more transactional fashion than under
previous administrations.

This shift matters because it suggests a shift in how the White House
understands the norms governing its relationships with allies. Alan
Fiske, an anthropologist who studies the structure of social
relationships, argues that there are four ideal-typical forms of
relationships, each of which is based on a different norm of exchange.14
[Robust alliances are]{.underline} often [governed by]{.underline} what
Fiske calls [**"communal sharing"** norms]{.underline}: NATO's Article
5, for example, enshrines the norm of collective defense, in which an
attack on one member of the alliance is understood as an attack on all
members because of their common membership within a group. [Allies are
**one and the same**; part of a **broader community**]{.underline}.
Trump's recent comments, however, imply [a shift]{.underline} away from
communal sharing [toward]{.underline} a different norm: **["market
pricing."]{.underline}** This form of relationship [is dictated by
**cost-benefit calculations**]{.underline}. Countries must contribute
proportional to what they have in order to receive the benefits. Allies
are business partners, rather than close friends.

Why does this shift matter? [Psychological research tells us that
applying market-pricing frameworks to relationships previously
characterized by communal sharing leads to **conflict** and
**contention**]{.underline}.15 [Actors subjected to]{.underline} these
**["taboo tradeoffs"]{.underline}** often [experience **negative
reactions**]{.underline}: when we have family over for Thanksgiving
dinner, we rarely present them with the bill afterwards because it
violates the norm of exchange around which the relationship is based.
The very act of monetizing the exchange seems taboo, just as it seems
taboo to offer to buy someone's kidney.16 [Reframing alliances in purely
**transactional terms** may **inherently undermine** cohesion and
generate distrust. It also undermines their **deterrent
power**]{.underline}, because communal sharing relationships are built
around moral motives of unity: outgroup members know that members of the
ingroup are committed to unite automatically against outsiders who pose
threats.17 In contrast, [if an alliance is based solely on market
pricing, **outsiders know**]{.underline} that with the proper incentives
[alliance members can be]{.underline} bought off or [**wedged apart**
from one another]{.underline}.

Motivated Images: From Friend to Foe

Both [[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} and mass publics in [international
politics]{.underline} often [[have]{.underline}]{.mark} images or
stereotypes of other countries, **[[cognitive
schema]{.underline}]{.mark}** that actors rely on [[to make sense
of]{.mark} international **[relations]{.mark}**hips]{.underline}.18
Images tend to have common structures: the "enemy image," popular during
the Cold War, for example, was of another actor of similar relative
capabilities and cultural status, but with threatening intentions; the
"colony image" was of actors with weaker relative capabilities and of
lower cultural status, who posed an opportunity rather than a threat.
Because of this schematic structure, images lead to routinized
interaction: knowing what image a decision-maker has of their
relationship with another country tells us a great deal about the policy
preferences that follow.

A decision-maker who has an enemy image of another country, for example,
will tend to see that country as being driven by malign and unlimited
motives, led by a unified regime that nonetheless can be contained by a
sufficient use of force. A decision-maker who has a colony image of
another country often tends to perceive it as being internally divided,
between good forces (led by a progressive, modernizing leader, but who
needs external support) and bad ones (led by radical fanatics or local
puppets of foreign enemies), thereby legitimating intervention to prop
up the former and quash the latter. Once images are embedded, they shape
both the kind of information we seek out, and how that information is
interpreted.

Importantly, images are motivated; what we want affects the image we
see. [The **ally image** is **undergirded** by perceived opportunities
for **mutual gain**]{.underline}, while an enemy image presents itself
when we see others as posing a threat. As the international relations
scholar Richard Herrmann notes, "as the feeling that another country has
goals that threaten one's own increases, so does the inclination to
construct a cognitive picture of that other country that features
negative items."19 In other words, [even though we often think of
[images]{.mark} as being deeply embedded and thus resistant to change,
they [can **flip quickly** based on]{.mark} the **presence** or absence
of **[conflicts of interest]{.mark}**. This means that the ally image
that other countries have of the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [can be **overridden** when [facing
**American**]{.mark} **policy [choices]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
violate allies' interests in stability or a liberal, rule-based
international order. It matters even if these negative images of the
United States are only held by foreign publics rather than more
pragmatic governing elites, since foreign leaders will find it harder to
make concessions in negotiations with the United States when doing so is
deeply unpopular with their publics or domestic audiences.

Furthermore, [the [images]{.mark} we form of countries [are **not
only**]{.mark} built around [**narrow** bilateral interactions]{.mark}.
Washington's [interactions with **others**]{.mark} will also [shape its
image with allies]{.mark}. For example, German [decision
makers]{.mark}]{.underline} may [draw inferences]{.underline} about the
Trump administration's commitment to a liberal world order [not only
from]{.underline} their **[direct interactions]{.underline}** with the
administration [but from what they read and [observe]{.mark}
about]{.underline} his domestic rhetoric and policies, his appointees,
his [[interactions with **other**]{.underline}]{.mark} leaders and
**[[countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and so on. [As a result, U.S.
[actions in **one domain**]{.mark} may well
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline} the [judgments]{.underline} of statesmen
[on [**wholly distinct** matters, **amplifying**]{.mark} **their
[effect]{.mark}** and increasing the **speed** with which **shifts in
alliance credibility** can occur]{.underline}.

Motivated Reasoning: Impressions Stick

Whether citizens or diplomats, psychologists tell us that humans are
"goal-directed information processors" who tend to evaluate information
in a way that reinforces their pre-existing views.20 We tend to seek out
information consistent with what we already believe (what psychologists
call a confirmation bias), and heavily discount information that
challenges our priors (a disconfirmation bias). Trump's unpredictability
and incendiary rhetoric during the campaign, transition, and first
months of the administration has created an image that will be hard to
reverse. Even if Trump seeks to backtrack from his prior rhetoric and
[positions]{.underline}, the salience of his original views
**[risk]{.underline}**s [a **self-reinforcing spiral**]{.underline}, in
which information that fits that image will be more easily believed than
information that contradicts it. [Foreign allies will **seek out** and
**place more weight** on information that **confirms** their initial
impressions, and place a lower weight on disconfirming
evidence]{.underline}.

Motivated reasoning thus offers yet another mechanism through which
[alliances can **erode** once negative impressions have been
established]{.underline}. This reinforcing spiral, when combined with
the other mechanisms listed above, also shows how the effects we
describe here have the potential to persist even if the Trump
administration should be succeeded by a more conventional presidential
administration. [The greater the stressors]{.underline} the current
administration [places on the alliance system --- sending out **[mixed
messages]{.mark}** that [undermine the **credibility** of]{.mark} **U.S.
[commitments]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or carrying out actions that prompt
allies to hedge and seek out alternate arrangements --- [the harder it
will be for future administrations to **repair the
damage**]{.underline}.

Policy Implications

What does all of this mean for policymakers? We conclude by briefly
summarizing some key implications and recommendations:

U.S. policymakers seeking to manage and maintain alliances should not
place faith in their longevity being probable or automatic. Tension and
fragmentation is the historical norm in alliance relationships, and
[even U.S. [alliances have]{.mark} the [potential to **quickly
weaken**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[U.S. alliances rest]{.underline} both [on the]{.underline} credibility
of threats made to adversaries, and the [**credibility** of **promises**
made to allies]{.underline}. The Trump administration has focused on the
former, but neglected the latter. Because [**[cred]{.mark}**ibility
[is]{.mark} ultimately [a **belief**]{.mark} held [in the
**mind**]{.mark} of policymakers]{.underline}, it can change even in the
absence of shifts in the military balance, or in the legal terms of U.S.
treaty commitments. Both [allies']{.underline} and adversaries' [minds
can be **changed**: if allies]{.underline} and adversaries [doubt U.S.
commitments, they may **dramatically alter**]{.underline} their
[behavior]{.underline} even in the absence of material changes on the
ground. U.S. policymakers seeking to uphold U.S. alliances should
therefore not believe that material changes are the only ones that
matter.

Psychological factors are likely to mean that allies do not treat
statements or rhetoric by the Trump administration as merely "cheap
talk." On the contrary, even rhetorical statements can rapidly change
the way in which allies understand the nature of their relationship with
the United States. In general, these mechanisms are likely to exacerbate
rather than lessen the impact of any shifts that occur. Given the "bully
pulpit" that the President enjoys, and President Trump's willingness to
make policy pronouncements via Twitter, the President significant
leverage to change the nature of the U.S. alliance system even if other
cabinet members, parts of the U.S. bureaucracy, or Congress seek to
mitigate those effects.

Many of these mechanisms are self-reinforcing and interactive: they
strengthen rather than counteract each other. Furthermore,
**[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}**~~men~~ [draw
**[infer]{.mark}**ences]{.underline} about the administration [[from the
**totality** of]{.underline}]{.mark} its domestic and [international
[behavior, **not** simply]{.mark} from their own **[direct
experiences]{.mark}** of it. U.S. policymakers should expect to find it
difficult to prevent U.S. [actions in **one domain**]{.mark} from
**[influenc]{.mark}**ing the [judgments]{.mark} of statesmen [on **other
matters**]{.mark}. Collectively, [this]{.mark} has the potential to
[lead to]{.mark} **downward [spirals of confidence]{.mark}** in U.S.
commitments, [and]{.mark} to [**tipping points** that lead to
**sudden**]{.mark} and [**dramatic shifts** in alliance
stability]{.mark}, instead of slow and steady degradations in ally
confidence in U.S. commitments]{.underline}. U.S. policymakers should
therefore make preparations for contingencies that may have previously
seemed highly improbable or only plausible in the distant future such as
a sudden collapse in NATO's credibility, or South Korean or Japanese
willingness to pursue independent nuclear weapons, both of which seem
much more plausible today than would have been the case a year ago.

#### It's the [final straw]{.underline}, ruining assurance to the [most strategically vital]{.underline} place in the world\-\--that creates [ripple]{.underline} effects, escalating [every other]{.underline} region

Dr. A. Wess **Mitchell 15**, President of the Center for European Policy
Analysis, Doctorate in Political Science from the Otto Suhr Institut für
Politikwissenschaft at Freie Universität, Master's Degree from the
Center for German and European Studies at Georgetown University's Edmund
A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, "Against U.S. Retrenchment from
Europe and NATO", Defense Matters, 4/9/2015,
defencematters.org/news/against-u-s-retrenchment-from-europe-and-nato/311/

Who knows, maybe he is right. Maybe a U.S. withdrawal from NATO would
spur Europe to develop an army, provide for their own defense and take
geopolitics seriously. If this happened, it would indeed probably have a
salutary effect on the international system. But far more likely, our
backing out of NATO would not bring the Europeans together. The problem
is that this argument overlooks the possibility that European disunity
is itself rooted in structure -- that the very external forces he
believes will unite Europe in an America-less NATO would in fact plunge
them into deeper disunity, incentivizing greater Russian predation on
Europe's periphery. [A NATO without America would be a NATO in which the
Alliance's [**most exposed members**, **Poland** and]{.mark} the
[**Baltic States**, would]{.mark} immediately [seek]{.mark} serious
[guarantees from]{.mark} the Alliance's largest insulated members,
particularly [Germany]{.mark}. And this is **[not]{.mark} something
Germany is [likely]{.mark} to provide**]{.underline}.

An Alliance with a more vulnerable shoulder is an Alliance that would
present Russia with stronger, not weaker, incentives for revisionism.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} might not lead to a war, but at a minimum it
[would [mean a **heightened**]{.mark} **regional [security
dilemma]{.mark}** that regional powers would seek to address by whatever
means were at their disposal -- **increased regional self-help**,
**[defense spending]{.mark}**, **more [skittish]{.mark} regional foreign
[policies]{.mark}**[, etc. -- leading to]{.mark} **heightened East-West
[friction]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **perennial [crisis]{.mark}**. This
would make for a **less stable Central and Eastern Europe** and,
potentially, a reactivated strategic frontier along NATO's
formerly-quiescent Eastern rim.]{.underline}

In other words, there would be costs. The question is whether those
costs are greater than the costs that Bacevich and others describe as
existing under the present NATO status quo -- political ennui, lack of
military focus, American taxpayer money, etc.

I think the answer to that question is "yes": The costs of leaving NATO
would be higher for the United States than the costs of continuing with
the status quo. The answer would be "no" if the region in question --
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**entral and
**[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**astern **[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**urope --
were of negligible interest to the United States. But this
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps [one of [the **most
strategically-vital piece**]{.mark}**s [of real estate on the
globe]{.mark}** [-- the **flashpoint** of **all three**]{.mark} of the
Twentieth Century's **[great]{.mark} global
[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Only when it is unambiguously in the
Western ambit can Europe and the United States possess the secure global
base from which to collectively sortie into broader global geopolitics
and deal with the "rise of the rest." Were this region to fall into
renewed instability because of a U.S. withdrawal from NATO, the United
States would, within a few years' time, face a compelling need to
re-intervene -- only this time it would do so on terms less favorable to
itself than if it had maintained its original position in NATO to begin
with.

So in the end, Bacevich's argument can be rejected on grounds of
strategic cost-effectiveness. And this leaves aside many other reasons
rooted in the instrumental value of NATO: that Article V, for all its
apparent hollowness, does continue to hold the line against Russian
revisionism; that [[withdrawing]{.mark} from the **global geopolitical
line** [here]{.mark} could [create]{.mark} a **[costly]{.mark}
geopolitical [ripple effects]{.mark}** [in **other**]{.mark} **pivotal
global [regions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This last point is perhaps the most critical, as it undermines the whole
purpose of what the "tough love" school is trying to achieve by
experimenting with retrenchment: managing the transition to a more
multipolar international system. Already, in just a few months' time,
the Obama **[[Admin]{.underline}]{.mark}**istration has called into
question sixty years' worth of U.S. regional commitments and
foreign-policy operating principles. This [has arguably
[emboldened]{.mark} would-be U.S. global [rivals like
**China**]{.mark}]{.underline} into taking a more aggressive
geopolitical course than they otherwise would be countenancing.

come anyways, regardless of what the United States does. But we should
seek to manage them on our own terms -- not on an artificial timetable.
If we are exiting unipolarity, the timing and nature of the "dismount"
is everything. Why unnecessarily provoke geopolitical change on terms
unfavorable to us through bad timing and a desire for experimentation?

The Hidden Costs of Offshore Balancing

[The option of **[withdrawing]{.mark}**]{.underline} into North America
and conducting a strategy of offshore balancing
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [likely to become]{.underline} more
[[tempting]{.mark} to the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates over time as a means of alleviating the
pressures of geopolitical competition abroad and financial retrenchment
at home. Offshore balancing differs from big-power bargaining in that,
where the latter acknowledges the general benefit of continued
engagement abroad but seeks to shift the focus of that engagement from
allies to rivals, the former is inherently skeptical of the strategic
value of forward engagement and seeks to shift the burden of managing
regional problems to allies. The attractiveness of offshore balancing
has grown in recent years as an apparently straightforward means of
lessening the direct costs of U.S. regional management by reducing the
physical size of our military presence and range of political commitment
there. While such an approach might offer temporary advantages, it would
come with its own significant, often undercounted strategic costs to the
United States in the long term.

First, recent evidence suggests that [a policy of U.S. military
[retrenchment would make **major regions** less]{.mark} rather than more
[stable]{.mark}. For decades [advocates]{.mark} of offshore balancing
have [asserted as]{.mark} an **[unproven dogma]{.mark}** that a
[reduction]{.mark} in American alliance commitments [would lead]{.mark}
regional [states to]{.mark} automatically [balance]{.mark} against
threatening powers, replacing the function of containment normally
provided by U.S. extended deterrence, and that this would make regions
more stable--- all at lower expense to the United States. [Recent
experience]{.mark} provides a laboratory for **[test]{.mark}**ing the
validity of these [claims]{.mark}]{.underline}. As discussed in chapter
4, [the [behavior]{.mark} of U.S. allies over the past few years [has
shown]{.mark} that [small states]{.mark} do not only balance against
threats as offshore balancing advocates would predict; some also
**[acquiesce]{.mark}** in revisionist behavior through various forms of
accommodation. More over, while many U.S. allies are investing in
greater local military capabilities, it is not just taking the form of
defensive postures; [many]{.mark} are **[consider]{.mark}**ing offensive
or **even [nuclear capabilities]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} could
[contribute to **regional destabilization**]{.mark} unless accompanied
by a U.S. security presence. The **deterrent value** of **defensive
alliances** and the benefits of combined U.S. and allied balancing
against rivals, once lost, may not be so easy to replace]{.underline}.

Second, it is not clear that jettisoning alliances would result in the
financial windfall to the United States that many offshore balancing
advocates expect. Losing the advantage of forward positions provided by
allies would impose two new kinds of cost on the United States. One is
the need to increase air and naval power: to achieve a level of power
projection capability similar to what it possesses through overseas
basing, much of which is on the territory of allied states, the United
States would have to develop a significantly larger air force cap able
of conducting offensive and lift operations mainly from North America
and U.S. territories. It would also have to design and build large
numbers of airplanes capable of crossing large distances into hostile
air zones, a technological feat that is costly and unlikely to be
achieved anytime soon. Similarly, relying on the oceanic moat would call
for a much larger navy capable of maintaining a continuous presence
across multiple oceans. Developing such a force would cost the United
States a lot of money--- perhaps as much if not more than it currently
spends on overseas installations.5 A second, longer-term problem would
be strategic in nature: the high costs of achieving reentry into the
global rimlands once the United States has lost a forward presence
there. The wars of the twentieth century are a reminder of the degree of
national economic, military, and human exertion required of a power in
America's geographic position to achieve landfall in the Eurasian
littorals and mainland once regional balances have been upset.
Fortunately, in those eras, U.S. enemies did not develop the capability
to deny the United States access to these regions. In the era of rapidly
accelerating A2AD warfare technology, it cannot be assumed that
America's technological edge would allow it to do so again without
enduring prohibitively high costs in U.S. blood and treasure--- costs
that are likely to be higher than any temporary savings from an ad hoc
retrenchment.

A Strategy To Strengthen Alliances

[Alliances remain the best-known instrument at America's disposal for
guaranteeing its national security and competing effectively against
rivals in the new conditions of the twenty-first century. No
other]{.underline} current or foreseeable [strategic alternative is
likely to provide cost-effective replacements to built-in advantages
that alliances offer]{.underline} to the United States at as low a cost.
And contrary to claims of many critics on both left and right, they are
likely to continue to offer a strategic value to the United States under
conditions of economic austerity and contested primacy; indeed, they may
be even more important to the United States under such conditions than
in the immediate post-- Cold War period, when America's power was less
constrained and its rivals less numerous. In a more competitive
landscape, alliances may represent the crucial margin of advantage when
our edge in other traditional areas of strength is, at least for a time,
less decisive. [The costs of [losing]{.mark} **even a portion**
of]{.underline} these [**[relations]{.mark}**hips]{.underline}, whether
[[through **defection**]{.underline}]{.mark} or through continued
slippage due to rival probes and [U.S. **devaluation**, could be
**high**. It [could mean]{.mark} a weaker barrier against **[great-power
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a more permissive environment for the
territorial growth of Eurasian competitors, and perhaps someday the need
for a larger U.S. military to reproject power in and restabilize the
system once its balance has been lost--- all on the iffy proposition
that the United States can achieve similar benefits by bargaining with
large rivals or by withdrawing from the complicated affairs of the
world's regions entirely.

[It is therefore in the strategic interests of the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to strengthen its
alliances. Doing so should be an urgent policy priority at a moment of
intensifying probes by U.S. rivals and widespread [doubts about]{.mark}
American **[intent]{.mark}**ions]{.underline} and capabilities [in the
international system]{.underline}. Already these patterns [represent a
**significant global challenge** for the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates; [[allowed]{.mark} to persist
**[unchecked]{.mark}**, they could [lead to a]{.mark}]{.underline}
general and potentially [**[militarized crisis]{.mark}** in the U.S.-led
international order, [with **multiple**]{.mark} **vulnerable [allied
frontiers]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} various stages of **advanced
geopolitical competition**, **alliance fragmentation**, or]{.underline}
even local [[**war**. Given]{.mark} the [**strategic similarities** of
probing]{.mark} efforts [in]{.mark} such [**hotspots** as]{.mark}
**eastern [Ukraine]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
**[S]{.mark}**]{.underline}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea [[and]{.mark} the [**fungible nature** of
frontline]{.mark} allies' [concerns]{.mark} in these regions, the
[prospects for a **multiregional** crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} involving
American power [[are **high**]{.underline}]{.mark}er today than at other
any point in the modern era. However, [such a crisis has **not yet
occurred**, giving the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[an important and perishable window of opportunity to **shore
up**]{.underline} its [alliances as a **preventive** to **further
destabilization**]{.underline}. A strategy to do so would focus on
restoring American strategic credibility and raising the visible costs
that aggressive powers would have to pay to revise the system to their
favor. It would prioritize those alliances most in need of attention
while working systematically to reinforce the central pillars of U.S.
extended deterrence that are most in danger of collapse.

#### The plan breaks with a [key]{.underline} NATO policy [driven]{.underline} by [Eastern European]{.underline} allies

Sydney J. **Freedberg 14** Jr., MA in Security Studies from Georgetown
University, MPhil in European Studies from Cambridge University, AB from
Harvard University, Deputy Editor at Breaking Defense, "NATO Hews To
Strategic Ambiguity On Cyber Deterrence", Breaking Defense, 11/7/2014,
https://breakingdefense.com/2014/11/natos-hews-to-strategic-ambiguity-on-cyber-deterrence/

[[NATO is]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[taking cyber]{.mark}
threats]{.underline} as **[[seriously]{.underline}]{.mark}** as the
Russian tanks and nuclear weapons it was created to deter. But the
alliance has a long way to go just to shore up its own network defenses,
and it explicitly eschews any role on the offense. [[NATO has
not]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[written a **formal
policy**]{.underline}]{.mark} on how it would deter a cyber attack.
[[The]{.mark} net [result is]{.mark}]{.underline} a certain degree of
**[[strategic ambiguity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [--- but then [NATO
has]{.mark} **survived** and even [**thrived** on **ambiguity** for
**decades**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The [crucial]{.mark} development: September's]{.underline} NATO [summit
[declaration that]{.mark}]{.underline} the alliance's **[hallowed
[Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- which says an attack on one member
is an attack against all --- [[applies **equally**]{.mark} to
**virtual** attacks as to physical ones]{.underline}.

"\[In\] linking cyber defense to collective defense and Article 5, the
declaration says that cyber attacks...could be as harmful to modern
society as conventional attack," said Amb. Sorin Ducaru, NATO's
assistant secretary general for "emerging security challenges."

That said, [the [**Romanian** diplomat emphasized]{.mark}]{.underline}
at an Atlantic Council panel this week, [["there's **no**]{.mark}
**predetermined [threshold]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} no defined "red
line" beyond which a cyber attack counts as an act of war. But then NATO
never defined an automatic trigger for conventional or nuclear conflict
either, even during the height of the Cold War. [[Article 5]{.mark} only
commits a NATO member to "assist" allies under attack]{.underline} by
"such actions as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force"
--- [which [leaves **vast**]{.mark} **amounts** of **[wiggle
room]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

There was always doubt whether the United States would really risk
nuclear escalation against its homeland to defend West Germany, and, for
that matter, whether West Germany would stick with the alliance once
wartime commanders started using tactical nuclear weapons on its soil to
slow the Soviet horde. Yet despite these uncertainties, the Soviets were
ultimately still deterred.

So [when it came to cyber]{.underline}, Ducaru said, "[there was [a
**conscious decision** by]{.mark} the **[allies]{.mark}** in this policy
[that there is **benefit** in]{.mark} keeping [**flexibility** and
**ambiguity**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Despite that one area of (arguably inevitable) strategic ambiguity, the
NATO summit made the situation in cyberspace much clearer, argued
Christopher Painter, the State Department's cyber coordinator. Beyond
Article 5, "the NATO leaders' declaration \[stated\] that international
law including the UN Charter, the Law of Armed Conflict, international
humanitarian law, etc. applies in cyberspace just like it does in the
physical world," Painter said at the Atlantic Council event. "This is a
clear statement that this is not a lawless space --- \[and\] there was
some doubt before. There was some thought you had different rules
entirely for the cyber world than the physical world, which made no
sense and in fact would be very destabilizing."

"Cyber seems so weird and different \[that\] it's really inhibited
seeing which of the old laws and ways of thinking about it might apply,"
said Jason Healey, the Atlantic Council's in-house cyber strategist. In
fact, he argued, "the more strategically significant the conflict, the
more similar it is to conflict in the air, land, and sea."

Notably, the Russians --- widely considered capable of out-hacking even
the Chinese --- have not launched a purely online offensive since
Estonia in 2007, when technical success in shutting down websites not
only failed to intimidate Tallinn but outright backfired on a strategic
level, scaring NATO into taking cyber seriously. Ever since, in Georgia,
Crimea, and now eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin has subordinated cyber to
propaganda and good old-fashioned men with guns.

"I'm actually quite hopeful," Healey said. NATO has been willing to
brush aside Russia's flimsy denials and hold the Kremlin accountable for
both the actions of its insignia-less "little green men" in Crimea and
its "patriotic hackers" in Estonia. "We will not be tricked," he said.

[[Cyber **nests within** a **wider**]{.mark} **"NATO
[discussion]{.mark}** and analysis [on]{.mark} the **[hybrid
warfare]{.mark}** concept,"]{.underline} said Amb. Ducaru. "The cyber
dimension fits very well into this concept that brings together the
conventional with the nonconventional, the low and high-tech elements,
the regular and irregular, \[and\] also this element of deniability of
responsibility."

[[The **hard part**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Ducaru admitted, [[is]{.mark}
figuring out **[how to respond]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "NATO's mandate
in cyber is about cyber defense," he said. "It's not about cyber warfare
or cyber attack or cyber offensive weapons."

Ambiguity: NATO's Digital Defense In Doubt Amid Unstable Alliances",

Email inboxes of Estonian journalists were flooded with spam. The
Ministry of Defence's website went down. The Estonian government blamed
Russia for the digital blitz. The crippling cyberattack lasted for three
weeks and at the time was known as perhaps the most brazen act of cyber
aggression by one state on another. But more than a decade later,
[the]{.underline} alleged [[Russian **cyber**]{.mark}attack [on
**Estonia** is]{.mark}]{.underline} seen as [[a **rallying cry** for
NATO to **bolster**]{.mark} its **[cyber prowess]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Today, the [alliance counts **cyber**]{.mark}security as one of [its
**core mission**]{.mark}s. [It]{.mark} has [placed a]{.mark} new
[cyber]{.mark} research [center in the **heart** of the **Baltic
nation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

But amid what is viewed as a sustained campaign of Russian digital
warfare on the West and the trans-Atlantic alliance ― whose foundations
are being questioned through a surge of populism ― [the very future of
NATO's cyber [strategy is left **intentionally
murky**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

During a May speech, NATO Secretary General Jens
[[Stoltenberg]{.underline}]{.mark} said he [[is]{.mark} often
[asked]{.mark} under [what circumstances]{.mark}]{.underline} the
organization [would [trigger Article 5 in]{.mark} the case for a
**[cyber]{.mark}**attack]{.underline}.

Article 5 is the alliance's principle of collective self-defense; an
attack on one member nation is considered an attack on all member
nations.

Trump rips NATO members ahead of summit

It\'s \"not fair\" that America spends more on NATO than allies, the
president tweeted ahead of the Brussels summit.

"[My [answer]{.mark} is: [**We will see**. The
level]{.mark}]{.underline} of cyberattack that would provoke a response
[[**must** remain **purposefully vague**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as will
the nature of our response," Stoltenberg said. "[It could
include]{.underline} diplomatic and economic sanctions, cyber responses,
or [even **conventional** forces]{.underline}, depending on the nature
and consequences of the attack."

Questions over how NATO will respond to a cyberattack come as the
alliance takes steps to bolster its digital protocols. In its joint air
power strategy, unveiled in late June, NATO added cyberwarfare to its
joint operations programs. The document boasts of the historic threat
the organization faces: "For the first time since the end of the Cold
War, the Alliance has to be able to conduct operations."

In 2014, the alliance said for the first time that a cyberattack could
trigger the organization's collective-defense mechanism. It has proven a
successful deterrent to combat large-scale digital attacks like the
reported Russian cyber assault on Estonia in 2007, said Sorin Ducaru, a
former assistant secretary general of NATO. But he added that the
alliance has to be more creative in deterring medium- and low-grade
cyberattacks "because that is the world we are living in."

[[For **Estonia**]{.mark}, an [**aggressive NATO cyber policy** could be
the **difference** between]{.mark} the [smooth withdrawal]{.mark} of
cash [or a disturbing "error"]{.mark} sign flashing on an ATM screen. An
**[Estonia]{.mark}**n intelligence report]{.underline} from earlier this
year [[predicts Russia will continue]{.mark} its campaign of [aggression
in **Eastern Europe**]{.mark} and the **Baltic states**
through]{.underline} a combination of [cyberattacks]{.underline} and
information warfare.

#### Aggressive NATO cyber defense is the [top priority]{.underline} of the Baltics

Regional Security Concerns

[U.S., NATO, and [Baltic leaders]{.mark} have [viewed
**Russia**]{.mark}**n military activity** in the region [with
**concern**]{.mark}]{.underline}; such activity includes large-scale
exercises, incursions into Baltic states' airspace, and a layered
build-up of anti-access/area denial (A2AD) capabilities. Experts have
concluded that defense of the Baltic states in a conventional military
conflict with Russia likely would be difficult and problematic. The
Baltic states fulfill NATO's target of spending 2% of gross domestic
product (GDP) on defense, although as countries with relatively small
populations, their armed forces remain relatively small and their
military capabilities limited. Consequently, the Baltic states' defense
planning relies heavily on their NATO membership.

Defense Cooperation and Security Assistance

[The **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[and]{.mark} the **[Baltic s]{.mark}**tates **[coop]{.mark}erate
[closely]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} **defense** and **security** issues.
New]{.underline} bilateral defense [agreements]{.underline} signed in
spring 2019 [focus security cooperation on improving capabilities
in]{.underline} areas such as maritime domain awareness, intelligence
sharing, surveillance, and **[[cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
United States provides significant security assistance to the Baltic
states; the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020
(P.L. 116-92) increased and extended U.S. assistance for building
interoperability and capacity to deter and resist aggression. Under the
U.S. European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), launched in 2014, the United
States has bolstered its military presence in Central and Eastern
Europe. As part of the associated Operation Atlantic Resolve, rotational
U.S. forces have conducted various training activities and exercises in
the Baltic states.

[NATO has also helped to bolster the Baltic states'
security]{.underline}. At the 2016 NATO summit, the allies agreed to
deploy multinational battalions to each of the Baltic states and Poland.
The United Kingdom leads the battalion deployed in Estonia, Canada leads
in Latvia, and Germany leads in Lithuania. Rotational deployments of
aircraft from NATO member countries have patrolled the Baltic states'
airspace since 2004; deployments have increased in size since 2014.

Potential Hybrid Threats

Since 2014, when the EU adopted sanctions targeting Russia due to the
Ukraine conflict, [[tensions]{.mark} between Russia and the Baltic
states [have **grown**]{.mark}. These [conditions]{.mark} have generated
**[heighten]{.mark}**ed [concerns about]{.mark}]{.underline} possible
**[[hybrid threats]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Russian tactics, such as
disinformation campaigns and propaganda, to pressure the Baltic states
and promote anti-U.S. or anti-NATO narratives. A large minority of the
Estonian and Latvian populations consists of ethnic Russians; Russia
frequently accuses Baltic state governments of violating the rights of
Russian speakers. Many ethnic Russians in the Baltic states receive
their news and information from Russian media sources, potentially
making those communities a leading target for disinformation and
propaganda. Some observers have expressed concerns that Russia could use
the Baltic states' ethnic Russian minorities as a pretext to manufacture
a crisis. [**[Cyber]{.mark}attacks** [are **a**]{.mark}nother potential
hybrid [threat; **addressing**]{.mark} **potential
[vulnerabilities]{.mark}** with regard to cybersecurity [is a **top
priority** of]{.mark} the **[Baltic s]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}.

Alliance", Lawfare, 2/14/2019,
https://www.lawfareblog.com/dont-let-cyber-attribution-debates-tear-apart-nato-alliance

[[NATO's cyber]{.mark}-defense [mandate]{.mark} has [evolved]{.mark}
over time [to update its]{.mark} collective defense [commitment under
Article V]{.mark}]{.underline} of the North Atlantic Treaty [for the era
of cyberattacks. In the latest effort to collectively impose costs on
adversaries, [the 2018]{.mark} NATO [Summit saw a
commitment]{.mark}]{.underline} from heads of state and government ["[to
integrate]{.mark}]{.underline} sovereign [[cyber]{.mark}
effects]{.underline}, provided voluntarily by Allies, [[into Alliance
**op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}** and missions, in the framework of
strong political oversight]{.underline}." The newly updated White House
National Cyber Strategy likewise envisions working together with a
"coalition of like-minded states" to "ensure adversaries understand the
consequences of their malicious cyber behavior."

Therein lies the rub. Both formal alliances, such as NATO, and more ad
hoc arrangements, such as what the Cyber Deterrence Initiative imagines,
will require members to share intelligence and eventually, to the best
of their ability and perhaps in different domains, contribute to joint
action against a presumably well-armed foreign aggressor. States
including the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,
Estonia, and Denmark have publicly declared their willingness to lend
sovereign offensive cyber effects to deter, defend against and counter
the full spectrum of threats.

[[Sharing **intel**]{.mark}ligence and information [is a **key element**
of]{.mark} NATO's core [decision-making]{.mark} process enshrined in
Article 4 of the Washington Treaty]{.underline}. Political consultations
are part of the preventive diplomacy between member states, but they are
also an avenue to discuss concerns related to the security threats
member states face. These consultations can be a catalyst for reaching a
consensus on policies to be adopted or actions to be taken---including
those on the use of sovereign cyber effects to support a NATO operation.

The alliance has a track record of collective action and cooperative
security measures. For example, Operation Active Endeavour helped to
deter, disrupt and protect against terrorist activity in the
Mediterranean in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, in
solidarity with the United States. For the seventh time, the Atlantic
Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative will be among the organizations
privileged to organize an event on the sidelines of the Feb. 15--17
Munich Security Conference. This year in particular, the Atlantic
Council's event, "Defending Human Dignity: Limiting Malicious Cyber
Activity Through Diplomacy," will complement the topics high on the
agenda of the main conference, such as transatlantic collaboration, the
consequences of a resurgence of great power competition and the future
of arms control.

In the United States, the greatest failures of response and deterrence
to foreign aggression in cyberspace have not been caused by a lack of
intelligence, capability or imagination. Rather, U.S. policy has been
serviceable in theory but impotent in practice because of an inability
to translate technical findings and intelligence into public support for
sufficiently tough responses ordered by elected political leaders. North
Korea's repeated operations targeting U.S. companies and critical
infrastructure have been met with public skepticism over their
culpability, limiting the strength of retaliatory options needed to
deter further events. Chinese cyber economic espionage continued for
years despite widespread knowledge of China's activities because
political leaders found it difficult to confront Beijing without
undermining U.S. companies in return. Russian information operations did
not sow enough doubt to mislead experts, but they succeeded in
exacerbating the partisan polarization of an already-divided electorate
and its leaders.

That inability to translate the findings of cyber experts into public
sentiment and therefore political action has sidelined America's
cyberwarriors, by far the most technologically advanced and
well-resourced in the world. Imagine the political response of an ally
that is asked to burden-share in response to cyber aggression but is
probably much closer to any resulting kinetic fight than the United
States.

Now imagine the response of that ally when it's being asked to take
causus belli on faith: The United States is presenting attribution for a
cyberattack elsewhere in the world, but perhaps is depending on the ally
lacking critical details due to classification, and is presenting that
information alongside a request for help that might well put the ally in
the crosshairs of its own cyberattack or lethal action. How can allies
with different capabilities to collect, analyze and understand
intelligence be part of a consensus on using sovereign cyber effects to
support a NATO operation? How can a commander achieve a common
operational picture to authorize the use of sovereign effects in a NATO
operation if all the allies are not on the same page with respect to
critical attribution and other technical information needed for a use of
effect in an operation? We all know what a tank looks like on a shared
satellite image, but if you ask three cyber experts to interpret the
attribution for a set of indicators, you are likely to get at least four
answers.

For most U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere, there is simply a dearth
of technical know-how within the government when it comes to cyber
attribution and operations. This is already a challenge for the United
States, with a massive defense budget, Silicon Valley innovation and an
educated workforce to pull into government service. But for many U.S.
allies, tech-savvy public servants will have long fled for the private
sector, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and academia before
reaching ministerial positions.

To its credit, the U.S. National Cyber Strategy does propose
capacity-building measures to support allies. This means building up law
enforcement, intelligence, and military operational and investigative
capability. But even with successful capacity-building programs, many
nations could, in a crisis, end up in the same place the United States
is---with good options stuck on the shelf while political leaders and
their electorates lack a critical mass of informed voters to trust,
understand and act on expert findings.

For countries weighing whether to risk their own blood and treasure in
support of an ally's cyber attribution findings, this hurdle could well
prove insurmountable if not addressed well before a crisis emerges. Many
such countries will no doubt recall being burned when placing too much
confidence in U.S. technical and human sources without an ability to
evaluate the evidence for themselves, as with the Iraq weapons of mass
destruction findings.

The private sector will probably play a crucial role in providing
intelligence to support alliance responses to cyberattacks, especially
as a stopgap over the next few years. FireEye and its peer competitors
and partners regularly produce analyses of major world cyber
events---many that fly below the radar of Western leadership, in
fact---sometimes at a near-government quality and often covering much of
the same "classified" evidence.

More important, private-sector analysts are accustomed to writing for
impact with both their technical counterparts, like chief information
security officers (CISOs) and threat hunters, and nontechnical
stakeholders such as boards of directors, CEOs and other persons
controlling the purse strings. In this sense, unclassified,
private-sector and NGO-driven cyber threat intelligence can become the
lingua franca of discussions. Relying on commercial reporting generated
by international teams, rather than declassified government-generated
reports, both broadens the audience enough to make alliance discussions
feasible and mitigates against disparities in terminology across
national lines---the tendency of even closely integrated allies to
describe cyber "attack," "information operations," and attribution
findings with different implicit assumptions or implications.

Long-Term Thinking

In the long run, though, the U.S. and its more technologically advanced
allies---such as its fellow Five Eyes (Australia, Canada, New Zealand
and the U.K.), France and Japan---will have to make important policy
changes in the interests of furthering alliance cooperation in
cyberspace: a willingness to sometimes risk sensitive sources and
methods in order to get cyber threat intelligence into the hands of
other countries better positioned to take policy action, an end to
classifying public information like IP addresses solely because of their
acquisition via classified means, and greater transparency on their own
decision-making.

Government cyber leaders within the alliance should consider taking
another page out of the private-sector playbook as well: running
cyber-crisis exercises that involve more than the IT department. In the
commercial world, the more successful practice runs involve leaders at
both the CISO level and some presence from nontechnical teams that would
weigh in during a crisis, such as communications and legal. The best
exercises involve executives, too, who despite their busy schedules must
see for themselves how their companies would survive and respond during
a potentially ruinous cyberattack, and work through the minutiae of
leading a response themselves. The experience and confidence is
invaluable if ever called on during a real-life crisis, and the
organizational introspection by involving decision-makers at all levels
is irreplaceable.

Military-to-military cyber training as part of cross-country force
standardization and joint operational planning could pull in more senior
national leadership, beyond battlefield commanders, and be coupled with
increased funding for foreign affairs-led training for nontechnical
leaders.

The private sector could also meaningfully contribute during NATO
consultations when developing Allied Joint Publications to make sure
that definitions and requirements for threat intelligence incorporate
the best practices of NATO member countries' private sectors. If a U.S.
diplomat reaches out to his or her counterpart in an allied country to
ask for assistance responding to malware that's damaging critical
infrastructure, and that counterpart has to ask what malware is, the
response isn't going to happen.

### Link\-\--Hybrid War

#### The Baltics have [explicitly demanded]{.underline} the [retention]{.underline} of Article 5 as a [possible response]{.underline} to hybrid war\-\--the plan's [devastates]{.underline} U.S. credibility 

Lukas **Milevski 16**, Baltic Sea Fellow in the Eurasia Program at the
Foreign Policy Research Institute, "Little Green Men in the Baltic
States are an Article 5 Event", Foreign Policy Research Institute Baltic
Bulletin, 1/5/2016,
https://www.fpri.org/article/2016/01/little-green-men-in-the-baltic-states-are-an-article-5-event/

The ongoing [[debate about whether]{.underline}]{.mark} or not Russia's
little green men and so-called [[hybrid **war**]{.mark}fare are
sufficient to [invoke]{.mark}]{.underline} NATO's [[Article 5]{.mark}
has [caused **much concern** in the **Baltic
S**]{.mark}tates]{.underline} about how the rest of NATO would respond
to such an invocation. Analysts identify hybrid warfare by its blend of
non-military instruments of state power, such as media penetration or
ownership and economic sanctions, with semi-ambiguous use of military
power. The term 'little green men' stems from Russia's annexation of
Crimea, during which unidentified but clearly professional soldiers
masquerading as local self-defense militia became a focal point for
international media. [NATO's Article 5 is the alliance's collective
defense clause, stipulating that an attack upon one is an attack upon
all. **[Little green men]{.mark}**]{.underline} are---or at least,
[**[should be---an Article 5 concern]{.mark}**. Two related but distinct
tacks support this point: [politically]{.mark}, the [utility]{.mark} of
little green men [has]{.mark} already [culminated]{.mark}, while
[**strategically**, they constitute an **unambiguous armed
attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Politically, little green men are effectively a one-shot strategy. They
rely on the political ambiguity over their identity and allegiance to
stay a response, particularly an armed response, until the situation on
the ground moves irreversibly in their favor. This is what occurred in
Crimea. As the crisis went on, everyone knew that the little green men
were Russian soldiers but the situation afforded just enough ambiguity
to allow the West to assume a wait-and-see political posture as if their
true identify had not been confirmed. Putin himself did admit afterward
that they were in fact Russian forces. Ukraine of course learned from
its mistake of inaction in Crimea and responded to the Russian presence
in the Donbas, a response which forced similarly ambiguous Russian
escalation of support to its proxies. Now that Russia is heavily
involved in Syria---allegedly also including more "hybrid warfare"---the
Donbas enclaves are feeling the pinch of reduced Russian support.

[Little green men have proven themselves in Ukraine to be **just another
form** of Russian military power]{.underline}. Where the little green
men have succeeded, the Russian state apparatus has followed. Where they
have not succeeded, they remain, if not politically deniable, then at
least politically disposable.

The ambiguity of the little green men is calculated to increase the
political difficulty of a second, or third, party response. In every
case, however, political ambiguity worked best when political interest,
political will, and/or media attention were lacking. [In Crimea, both
Ukraine and the West lacked sufficient political interest and will for a
strong response, although media attention abounded]{.underline}. In the
Donbas, Ukraine found the interest and will to fight, and persisted in
doing so even as international media attention waned. In Syria, should
the allegations of Russian hybrid warfare prove to be true, none of
these three factors exists---the West does not have the interest, will,
or attention span to respond to an independent Russian role in the
Syrian civil war.

[These same conditions would not be replicated if little green men
should appear in the countries many have speculated may be next---the
**[Baltic S]{.mark}**tates. The Balts have **[learned from
Crimea]{.mark} and Donbas**, [and **understand the appropriate
response**]{.mark} to a hypothetical appearance of little green men. As
Minister of Defense]{.underline}, current President Raimonds [Vējonis
stated [bluntly]{.mark}]{.underline} several times on the record [that
if little green men appear in Latvia, military force will be employed:
**["we will shoot them."]{.mark}** Nor would the Baltic States be a
**media backwater** should serious Russian-themed trouble occur. [The
topic would **force itself onto the world's**]{.mark}**---and especially
NATO's---[immediate]{.mark} political [agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}. An
invocation would oblige NATO to confront the reality that the little
green men directly represent Russian military and state power and that a
NATO constituent country is under direct military attack. [Ultimately
NATO remains an alliance committed to the mutual defense of its member
states. **[If Article 5 is not upheld]{.mark}, the [alliance loses not
only]{.mark} its [credibility]{.mark}**[, but]{.mark} also its
**[desirability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On 1-2 December 2015 in Brussels
[[NATO **recognized as much** by adopting a policy which **allows**
invocation of Article 5]{.underline}]{.mark} not just in response to
overt invasion, but also [[in]{.mark} case of [**hybrid warfare**, as
**one choice**]{.mark} **among others (such as Article 4,
consultation)** open to member countries]{.underline}.

The fear of abandonment

[The clearest outcome of]{.underline} this [posture that seeks great-
power accommodation]{.underline} and puts a premium on technological
solution [has been that]{.underline} U.S. [allies are
**nervous**]{.underline} while rivals are emboldened. [[Alliances are
**fragile**]{.mark} associations, and their [existence is **contingent**
on]{.mark} multiple factors, ranging from]{.underline} the **[[political
will]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the parties that makes the alliance
possible [to the]{.underline} larger **[geopolitical
environment]{.underline}** that makes it necessary. [[They]{.mark}
therefore [require **constant maintenance**,
mitigating]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[fear]{.mark}** that the alliance
will not increase]{.underline} the [security]{.underline} of its
signatories.

[[Historically]{.mark}, the [greatest]{.mark} fear [of]{.mark} the
**[weak]{.mark}**er [allies is]{.mark} that of
**[abandonment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which in its broadest connotation
means that not all involved actors consider credible the security
guarantees offered to a state. The clearest form of abandonment is when
one side reneges on the security commitments to the other party, like in
the case of France and Great Britain negotiating with Nazi Germany in
1938 over their ally Czechoslovakia. But abandonment can take other,
less conspicuous forms, driven in part by the fear of entrapment that
the less dependent and more powerful ally may have. The stronger ally,
in fact, wants to avoid being dragged into a local conflict instigated
by its smaller ally, a conflict in which it has few immediate interests
at stake.73 To do so, it is tempting to ignore, or even undermine, the
most immediate security concerns of the weaker, more dependent ally. The
goal is to sidestep a war or tensions deemed unnecessary and distracting
from more important objectives. The weak fear abandonment; the strong
fear entrapment.74

[[A distant]{.mark} **maritime [power]{.mark}**, such as the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [[is
**particularly susceptible**]{.mark} to this entrapment anxiety.
Geographic distance removes the **perception of immediacy** of the
threat and puts a **premium** on global stability, often at the expense
of]{.underline} local **[allies' interests]{.underline}**. Such an
approach was visible in U.S. foreign policy toward East Asia in the
early Cold War, when the objective was not just to contain China but
also to restrain U.S. allies from engaging in "little wars" that had the
potential of escalating into great- power confrontation with China and
the Soviet Union.75 [It is]{.underline} also [possible to
[observe]{.mark} similar]{.underline} U.S. [[behavior
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the Middle East, East Asia, and **[[Central
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}** in recent years. Washington seems
preoccupied more with the possibility that some of its frontline, small,
and exposed allies would engage in an overly aggressive foreign policy
than with the persistent rhetorical aggressiveness and geopolitical
expansion of the rival powers. In the Middle East, Washington often
seems more worried about a potential Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear
facilities than about Tehran's policies.76 Israel, on the other hand,
fears a nuclear Iran and frets at any sign of U.S. neglect. Similarly,
in East Asia, the United States is always preoccupied with an overly
assertive ally, such as Japan in the South China Sea disputes that could
draw American forces into a local conflict, insignificant to Washington
while vital to Tokyo. And [in Central Europe, [states such as **Poland**
express]{.mark} their [disappointment]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
uselessness of the United States as an ally, while Washington worries
about an anti- Russian Poland spoiling Moscow's promises of geopolitical
cooperation.

The challenge is that the answer to entrapment fears often is a
reluctance to support firmly the smaller ally and a posture of
accommodation toward the common rival. This generates ally nervousness.
As Glenn Snyder puts it, "The most undesirable side effect of
conciliating the adversary is that it entails the risk of abandonment by
the ally. His fear that one is contemplating realignment may induce him,
not to try to discourage this by becoming more accommodative, as
suggested above, but to realign preemptively or at least move closer to
the opponent. "77 [[An attitude that **deprioritizes**]{.mark} allies
**[forces]{.mark}** those [states to **reconsider**]{.mark} their
**[fo]{.mark}**reign **[po]{.mark}**licy preferences]{.underline}. As we
will discuss in the next chapter, such behavior on the part of the
United States also emboldens our rivals.

For the region of [[Central Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}, including for
the purposes of this essay the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary
and the "Baltic 3" -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, geography and
history have dictated the need to pay special attention to the issue of
security and survival of the state. The nation-states which emerged from
the collapse of the Soviet empire nurtured the feelings of victimization
and distrust for both its potent neighbour to the East, and the "West",
frequently accused of ignoring or betraying the interests of the region.

Despite their legacy of successful political, societal and economic
transformation, and membership in NATO and the European Union, [security
cultures]{.underline} of the countries in the region [[are **still**
characterized by]{.mark} the [**fear of abandonment** and]{.mark} a
**[high]{.mark} degree of [caution]{.mark}**]{.underline} regarding
political declarations not backed by actions. Especially with regards to
the three Baltic states and Poland, [their quest for [external
guarantees did **not** stop at]{.mark} securing formal commitments from
[NATO]{.mark}. The **[cred]{.mark}ibility** of **both** conventional and
nuclear deterrence [is **constantly assessed** against]{.mark} the
background of **[outside developments]{.mark}** and internal state of
the affairs within the Alliance]{.underline}.

The starting point of this analysis in the description of the
limitations of the shape of the deterrence posture in the countries of
the region during the process of NATO enlargement. A political agreement
reached with Russia precluded the stationing of nuclear weapons or
substantial combat forces at the territory of the countries admitted to
the Alliance. [In practice, the **[cred]{.mark}ibility** of the NATO's
commitments **[depend]{.mark}**ed mostly [on the **perception**
of]{.mark} the [**strength** and **unity**]{.mark} of the Alliance
itself]{.underline}. Whereas such a solution was fully acceptable in the
1990s, the second part of the essay describes the
[[factors]{.underline}]{.mark} which in the last years
**[[contribute]{.underline}]{.mark}**d [[to]{.mark} the
[diminishing]{.mark} of]{.underline} the [credibility of deterrence
pledges: the [change of]{.mark} the **situation in [Russia]{.mark}**,
the **[policy of]{.mark} the new [US]{.mark} administration**, [and
**doubts over**]{.mark} **NATO's [cohesion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
third chapter describes the **[[actions]{.underline}]{.mark}** taken at
the initiative of the countries of the region to
**[[influence]{.underline}]{.mark}** the policies of NATO and the
**[US]{.underline}** towards increased **[[reassurance of]{.mark} the
Eastern [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The possibilities of the
emergence of the alternative sources of security guarantees (EU,
European states) are also discussed. Finally, the article turns to the
unsuccessful attempts to establish a form of extended deterrence for the
benefit of Georgia and Ukraine.

[Together, [U.S.]{.mark} military strength and political

the belief that the United States is willing and able to take
retaliatory action--- if necessary, using nuclear weapons--- to
guarantee the territorial integrity of its allies. [This produced a
sense of **[strategic certainty]{.mark}** that is [an **anomaly in

protection, allies have **aligned their diplomacy** with U.S.

American habits of war, maintained generally open economic policies, and
provided support for U.S. initiatives outside their own regions.

Stabilizing the Present

NATO's advocates are also prone to hyperbole, but one word that is not
an overstatement is irreplaceable. It would be difficult---if not
impossible---to recreate NATO or something like it from scratch. Still,
[even [irreplaceable doesn't imply **permanence** if]{.mark} the
alliance's [value cannot]{.mark} readily [be]{.mark}]{.underline}
established and [[**sold** to]{.mark} the populations of its constituent
[members]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially Americans.

[[**Demography** is not on the]{.mark} alliance's
[side]{.mark}]{.underline}. Should NATO survive to celebrate its
centennial, [the generation]{.underline} being [born]{.underline} at
that time [will be]{.underline} as [**far removed** from
the]{.underline} end of the [Second World War]{.underline} as someone
born in 1969 was from the conclusion of the American Civil War.
[Even]{.underline} the [[September 11th]{.underline}]{.mark}

**half century**]{.mark} in the [past]{.mark}. In short, shared
historical experience or even simple [nostalgia will **not be

and]{.underline}, to be blunt, [the broader interests of its essential

[The [most effective]{.mark} way]{.underline} of doing that [[is

That [[relations between America and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}---and
overall stability in Eastern Europe---might be far worse without the
alliance is also true, but [[is a **difficult sell**]{.mark} in trying

Outcomes? Dangerous New Pathways to Escalation", Arms Control Today,
November 2019,
https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation

The first and possibly most [dangerous]{.underline} path to [escalation
would arise from]{.underline} the [early use of
**cyberweapons**]{.underline} in a great power crisis to paralyze the
vital command, control, and communications capabilities of an adversary,
many of which serve nuclear and conventional forces. [[In]{.mark} the
**["fog of war"]{.mark}**]{.underline} that would naturally ensue from
such an encounter, [the [recipient]{.mark}]{.underline} of such an
attack [might [fear]{.mark}]{.underline} more punishing
[[follow-up]{.mark} kinetic attacks]{.underline}, possibly
[including]{.underline} the [use of **[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark}, fearing]{.underline} the [loss of
its]{.underline} own [arsenal, [launch]{.mark}]{.underline} its weapons
[**[immediately]{.mark}**. This might occur, [for example, in]{.mark} a
[confrontation between **NATO and Russia**]{.mark}**n forces**
[in]{.mark} **east and [central Europe]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} between
**[U.S. and Chinese]{.mark} forces** [in]{.mark} the
**[Asia]{.mark}-Pacific region**]{.underline}.

Speaking of a possible confrontation in Europe, for example, James N.
Miller Jr. and Richard Fontaine wrote that "[[both]{.mark}
sides]{.underline} would [have **overwhelming incentives** to [**go
early** with]{.mark}]{.underline} offensive cyber and
[**[counter-space]{.mark}** capabilities]{.underline} to negate the
other side's military capabilities or advantages." If these early
attacks succeeded, "it could result in huge military and coercive
advantage for the attacker." This might induce the recipient of such
attacks to back down, affording its rival a major victory at very low
cost. Alternatively, however, the recipient might view the attacks on
its critical command, control, and communications infrastructure as the
prelude to a full-scale attack aimed at neutralizing its nuclear
capabilities and choose to strike first. "It is worth considering,"
Miller and Fontaine concluded, "how [**[even]{.mark}** a **very
[limited]{.mark}** [attack]{.mark}]{.underline} or incident [could
[set]{.mark} both sides on [a]{.mark} **slippery [slope]{.mark}** [to
**rapid escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}."10

What makes the insertion of latent malware in an adversary's NC3 systems
so dangerous is that it may not even need to be activated to increase
the risk of nuclear escalation. If a nuclear-armed state comes to
believe that its critical systems are infested with enemy malware, its
[[leaders]{.mark} might]{.underline} not trust the information provided
by its early-warning systems in a crisis and might
[[misconstrue]{.underline}]{.mark} the nature of [an enemy attack,
[leading]{.mark} them [to **overreact**]{.mark} and]{.underline}
possibly [launch]{.underline} their [**nuclear weapons** out of
**fear**]{.underline} they are at risk [of a preemptive
strike]{.underline}.

"The [[uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark} caused by the unique character
of a cyber threat [could [jeopardize]{.mark}]{.underline} the
credibility of [[the]{.mark} **nuclear [deterrent]{.mark}** and
undermine **strategic stability**]{.underline} in ways that advances in
nuclear and conventional weapons do not," Page O. Stoutland and Samantha
Pitts-Kiefer wrote in 2018 paper for the Nuclear Threat Initiative.
"\[T\]he introduction of a flaw or malicious code into nuclear weapons
through the supply chain that compromises the effectiveness of those
weapons could lead to a lack of confidence in the nuclear deterrent,"
undermining strategic stability.11 Without confidence in the reliability
of its nuclear weapons infrastructure, a nuclear-armed state may
misinterpret confusing signals from its early-warning systems and,
fearing the worst, launch its own nuclear weapons rather than lose them
to an enemy's first strike. This makes the scenario proffered in the
2018 NPR report, of a nuclear response to an enemy cyberattack, that
much more alarming.

Yet another pathway to escalation could arise from a cascading series of
cyberstrikes and counterstrikes against vital national infrastructure
rather than on military targets. All major powers, along with Iran and
North Korea, have developed and deployed cyberweapons designed to
disrupt and destroy major elements of an adversary's key economic
systems, such as power grids, financial systems, and transportation
networks. As noted, Russia has infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid, and
it is widely believed that the United States has done the same in
Russia.12 The Pentagon has also devised a plan known as "Nitro Zeus,"
intended to immobilize the entire Iranian economy and so force it to
capitulate to U.S. demands or, if that approach failed, to pave the way
for a crippling air and missile attack.13

The danger here is that economic attacks of this sort, if undertaken
during a period of tension and crisis, could lead to an escalating
series of tit-for-tat attacks against ever more vital elements of an
adversary's critical infrastructure, producing widespread chaos and harm
and eventually leading one side to initiate kinetic attacks on critical
military targets, risking the slippery slope to nuclear conflict. For
example, a Russian cyberattack on the U.S. power grid could trigger U.S.
attacks on Russian energy and financial systems, causing widespread
disorder in both countries and generating an impulse for even more
devastating attacks. At some point, such [[attacks]{.mark} "could [lead
to **major conflict** and]{.mark}]{.underline} possibly **[[nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**."14

**other parts of the globe**]{.mark}. North Central Europe is **not the
only region** where small and mid-sized U.S. allies straddle strategic
fault lines near potentially hostile neighbors. Powers such as
[**Israel** and **Taiwan**]{.mark} both depend on the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [as an off-shore
security benefactor and **[closely monitor]{.mark} Washington\'s
[relations]{.mark}hips [in Central]{.mark} and Eastern [Europe for cues
on]{.mark} the [reliability]{.mark}** of the U.S. security link. [Should
these]{.mark} powers **[perceive]{.mark}** a trend toward [U.S.]{.mark}
**global [retrenchment]{.mark}**[, they]{.mark} might
**[re-evaluate]{.mark} their own strategic [options]{.mark}**[,
creating]{.mark} conditions that could contribute to the gradual
**[reactivation of]{.mark} old regional [security dilemmas]{.mark}**
best left dormant]{.underline}.

[It is this **wider strategic context** through which Washington should
view regional insecurity in Central Europe. The **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has begun taking steps to counter regional
uncertainty in the form of contingency planning for the Baltic States,
heightened regional security exercises]{.underline} (the upcoming
U.S.-Baltic 'Sabre Strike\' 2010 maneuvers), [a Patriot missile battery
in]{.underline} Morag, [Poland and]{.underline} pursuing [next
gen]{.underline}eration [BMD]{.underline} with planned components in
Romania and Bulgaria. These steps, however, are not sufficient.
Strategic reassurance can take many forms; the emphasis should be on
developing a package of instruments, including but not limited to
military reassurance, which strengthen the embeddedness of regional
states in Western institutions.

[The **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[would do well to approach]{.mark} strategic [reassurance
**through**]{.mark} **the lens of [NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the
2010 Strategic Concept, the Allies should reinforce their commitment to
territorial defense to complement the current emphasis on out-of-area
operations, which will alleviate concerns of a rising Russian threat.

#### Each [explodes]{.underline} into [World War III]{.underline}

Here are the five most [[**likely flashpoints** for]{.underline}]{.mark}
world war in 2020 (See my **[[World War III]{.underline}]{.mark}** lists
from back in 2017, 2018 and 2019).

None are particularly likely, but only one needs to catch fire. Let the
wars begin!

Iran-Israel:

[Iran and Israel are]{.underline} already [waging low-intensity war
across the Middle East]{.underline}. Iran supports anti-Israel proxies
in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and elsewhere, while Israel feels comfortable
in striking Iranian forces across the region. Israel has taken steps to
quietly build a broad anti-Iran coalition at the diplomatic level, while
Iran has invested deeply in cultivating ties with militias and other
non-state actors.

It is hardly difficult to imagine scenarios that might bring on a wider,
more intense war. If Iran determines to re-embark on its nuclear
program, or decides to discipline Saudi Arabia more thoroughly,
[[**Israel** might]{.underline}]{.mark} feel the temptation to [[engage
in]{.mark} broader strikes, or in [strikes]{.mark}]{.underline} directly
[against the Iranian homeland. [Such]{.mark} a conflict [could
**easily** have **wider implications**, threatening]{.mark} **global
[oil]{.mark} supplies** and]{.underline} potentially [[tempting]{.mark}
the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[or **Russia** to intervene]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Turkey:

Strains between Turkey and the United States have only grown over the
past year. Tensions increased dramatically when the United States
unexpectedly gave Turkey a green light to clear Syrian border areas of
U.S.-supported Kurds, then immediately issued an about-face and
threatened Ankara with sanctions. All the while, an arsenal of US
nuclear weapons, by all accounts, remains at Incirlik Air Force base.
Certain statements by President Erdogan suggested that he has immense
aspirations for Turkey, aspirations which might include nuclear
ambitions.

The state of the relationship between the U.S. and Turkey has decayed to
the extent that some fear for the future of the NATO alliance. No one
expects Erdogan to really go through with an attempted seizure of the
weapons, and even if he did it's unlikely Turkey could break the
safeguards on the warheads in any kind of reasonable time. But Erdogan
is not known to compartmentalize issues well, and it's possible that
linkages with other problems could push Washington and Ankara to the
very edge. And of course, Russia hovers on the edge of the problem,

Kashmir:

Over the past decade, the gap in conventional power between India and
Pakistan has only grown, even as Pakistan has tried to heal that gap
with nuclear weapons. Despite (or perhaps because) of this, tensions
between the rivals remained at a low simmer until steps taken by Prime
Minister Narendra Modi to reduce the autonomy of Kashmir and to change
citizenship policies within the rest of India. These steps have caused
some unrest within India, and have highlighted the long-standing
tensions between Delhi and Islamabad.

Further domestic disturbances within India could give Pakistan (or
extremist groups within Pakistan) the idea that it has the opportunity,
or perhaps even the responsibility, to intervene in some fashion. While
this is unlikely to begin with conventional military action, it could
consist of terrorist attacks internationally, in Kashmir, or
internationally. If this happened, Modi might feel forced to respond in
some fashion, leading to a ladder of escalation that could bring the two
countries to the brink of a more serious conflict. Given China's looming
position and the growing relationship between Delhi and Washington, this
kind of conflict could have remarkably disastrous international ripple
effects.

Korean Peninsula:

A year ago, hope remained that negotiations between the United States
and North Korea could succeed in permanently reducing tensions of the
peninsula. Unfortunately, core problems in the domestic situations of
both countries, along with a puzzling strategic conundrum, have
prevented any agreement from taking hold. Tensions between the two
countries now stand as high as at any time since 2017, and the impending
U.S. election could imperil relations further.

The Trump administration continues to seem to hold out hope that a deal
with North Korea could improve its electoral prospects in November. But
North Korea has no interest in the terms Trump is offering, and has
become increasingly emphatic about making its disinterest clear.
Recently, North Korea promised a "Christmas present" that many in the
United States worried would be a nuclear or ballistic missile test. It
turned out to be nothing of the sort, but if North Korea decides to
undertake an ICBM or (worse) nuclear test, the Trump administration
might feel the need to intervene forcefully. In particular, President
Trump has a reputation for pursuing a deeply personalistic foreign
policy style, and might feel betrayed by Supreme Leader Kim, producing
an even more uncertain situation.

South China Sea:

[[**U.S.-China relations** stand]{.mark} at a **[precarious]{.mark}**
point]{.underline}. A trade deal between the two countries would seem to
alleviate some tensions, but implementation remains in question.
Economic difficulties in China have curtailed some of its naval
construction program, just as a flattening of the defense budget in the
United States has moderated shipbuilding ambitions. At the same time,
China has worked assiduously to assure its relations with Russia, while
the United States has sparked controversies with both South Korea and
Japan, its two closest allies in the region.

Under such circumstances, it seems unlikely that either country would
risk conflict. But President [Trump]{.underline} has staked much of his
Presidency on confrontation with China, and [may]{.underline} feel
tempted to [escalate the situation]{.underline} in the coming year. For
his part, President [Xi faces]{.underline} the continuous prospect of
[turmoil at home]{.underline}, both in the Han heartland and in
Xinjiang. [[Both]{.mark} sides]{.underline}, thus, [[have incentives
for]{.underline}]{.mark} diplomatic and economic [[escalation,
which]{.underline}]{.mark} always [could [lead to **military
confrontation**]{.mark}]{.underline} in areas such as the South or East
China Seas.

What Does the Future Hold for 2020?

The prospect of global conflagration in 2020 is low. Everyone awaits the
result of the U.S. election, and a better understanding of the direction
of US policy for the next four years. Still, every crisis proceeds by
its own logic, and any of Pakistan, India, China, Israel, Iran, Turkey,
or Russia might feel compelled by events to act. Focus on the election
should not obscure the **[[frictions]{.underline}]{.mark}** between
nations that [[could]{.mark} provide the **[spark]{.mark}** for [the
**next war**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

https://www.the-american-interest.com/2011/03/01/the-vulnerability-of-peripheries/

Up and down the frontier of American global power, [[from]{.mark} the
**[S]{.mark}**]{.underline}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea [[to]{.mark} the **[Middle
East]{.mark}**, from the [**Caucasus** to]{.mark}]{.underline} the north
**[[Central Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**an plain, U.S. [[allies]{.mark}
are]{.underline} increasingly [nervous]{.underline}. Along the littoral
rim of East Asia, [South Koreans, Japanese, Taiwanese]{.underline} and
others in the region **[[watch]{.underline}]{.mark}**ed
**[[anxiously]{.underline}]{.mark}** throughout 2010 as China ratcheted
up efforts to assert control over strategic waterways and challenge the
U.S. position in Asia. In the Middle East, too, [Israel, Lebanon, Saudi
Arabia and]{.underline} the [Gulf States]{.underline} ended the year
less confident than ever that the United States would somehow bestir
itself to contain an aspiring nuclear-armed Iran. And on Europe's
eastern fringe, despite efforts at détente with Moscow, [Poland and the
Baltic States]{.underline} entered 2011 with deep uncertainties about
America's long-term regional commitment in the face of a decrepit but
atavistically revisionist Russia.

[[Viewed separately]{.underline}]{.mark}, these [are
**[unrelated]{.mark}** regional silos, each with its own geopolitical
rhythm]{.underline}, security logic [and ranking in the hierarchy of
American]{.underline} strategic and political [priorities. [But]{.mark}
**seen [together]{.mark}**[, a **different picture**]{.mark} emerges.
[In **all three**]{.mark} regions, [small]{.mark}, geopolitically
exposed [states with]{.mark}]{.underline} formal or informal
[[U.S.]{.mark} security [commitments straddle]{.mark}]{.underline}
age-old [**strategic [fault lines]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} **close
[proximity]{.mark}** [to **rising**]{.mark}]{.underline} or resurgent
**[power [centers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In all three, assertiveness on
the part of these larger powers has led American allies to reassess U.S.
assurances. And in all three, American allies have been at best
temporarily reassured, and at times unsettled, by Washington's response.
This has led them all, to one degree or another, to invest in new
strategic options to hedge against the possibility of eventual American
retrenchment.

Amid the now globally accepted thesis of American decline, America's
[global [rivals are]{.mark}]{.underline} doing what aspirant powers have
done at moments of transition for millennia:
**[[hypo]{.mark}thesis-[testing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They are
[**probing** the top state on the]{.underline} outer [**limits** of
its]{.underline} power [commitments]{.underline}, where its strategic
appendages are most vulnerable and its strength is most thinly spread.
If history is any guide at all, [they are **[reading]{.mark} America's
[responses]{.mark}** to gauge how much latitude they have]{.underline}
to make low-cost revisions to the system in their favor. But both they
and [American [**allies are watching** not just]{.mark} how America
responds to probes in [their **own** neck]{.mark} of the woods [but
**also**]{.mark} to the probes of powers---and to the needs of
**[similar]{.mark}ly situated [allies]{.mark}**[---in **other
regions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Lacking the geopolitical equivalent of a
stock market, [they are **[gathering]{.mark}**]{.underline} valuable
[[**cues** about]{.mark} America's **[intent]{.mark}**ions in their own
neighborhood [by tracking]{.mark} how it handles revisionists at
[**other points** on the]{.mark} U.S. strategic
[perimeter]{.mark}]{.underline}.

If accurate, [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} assessment holds profound
implications for American statecraft in the early decades of the 21st
century. It [[suggests]{.mark} a degree of **[global
interconnectedness]{.mark}**]{.underline} that has been largely absent
from contemporary policy thinking. If America's rivals are indeed
testing the hypothesis of its decline through probes on the strategic
periphery, and if they and our [allies are making strategic calculations
based on how Washington reacts to]{.underline} these
[tests]{.underline}, then this raises serious questions about the wisdom
of the recent U.S. emphasis on great power relationships and the
occasional, de facto downgrading of traditional alliances in search of
successful engagement gambits. It also calls into question the deeper
assumptions underlying our current strategic thinking. While a relative
attenuation of the U.S. position due to the "rise of the rest" is a
reality, an American power free-fall of the kind envisioned by some
foreign and even U.S. commentators is not inevitable; [[how]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[responds to]{.underline}]{.mark} its [competitors' [probes will
be]{.mark} an **[important]{.mark} ingredient** in [determining]{.mark}
the [**scale** and **pace** of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[change]{.underline}]{.mark} that does occur. In short, the hypothesis
of precipitous American decline needs to be disproven before its growing
momentum transforms it into a self-fulfilling juggernaut. And only
America can disprove it.

#### The plan creates a [demonstration effect]{.underline} that ruins perceptions of [unconditional reliability]{.underline}\-\--especially in the [Middle East]{.underline} and [Asia]{.underline}

It is [[a **demo**]{.mark}**nstration [effect]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that [will [create **ripples of insecurity** in Central]{.mark} and
Eastern [Europe but also]{.mark} in **[other]{.mark} global
[regions]{.mark}** in which small and mid-sized U.S. allies sit in close
proximity to large historically predatory powers]{.underline}. Jakub
Grygiel and I first warned about a trend in this direction in 2010, and
we are now seeing this concern is validated on a grand scale. Crimea
offers a template for low-cost revisionism---[[a]{.mark} **dangerous
[precedent]{.mark}** [for other]{.mark}]{.underline} revisionist-minded
[[powers]{.underline}]{.mark} in the international system [[who]{.mark}
may **[draw the conclusion]{.mark}** that]{.underline} the [use of
[force will be **rewarded**]{.mark} with **geopolitical faits
accomplis**]{.underline} and territorial gains at little cost to
themselves. It sends the message that the rules are flexible for those
who are willing to act boldly and use military force to revise the
status quo.

[The parallel danger]{.underline}, which Jakub and I have catalogued
extensively, [is that U.S. [allies in **other regions**]{.mark} may
[draw the lesson]{.mark} that the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[is only a **conditional
guarantor**]{.mark} at best of their security. Crimea [sends a
**signal**]{.mark} to small and mid-sized American allies [in]{.mark}
**Central [Europe]{.mark}**, the [**Middle East** and **Asia**]{.mark}
**Pacific** that]{.underline} we may be entering an era of
self-permissiveness on the part of revisionists, and that [the chief
guardian of the status quo, the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [may or may not be willing to underwrite the
stability of the system as a whole]{.underline}. The undermining of the
Budapest Memorandum is especially significant because this treaty
solemnized Ukraine's decision to give up its nuclear arsenal in exchange
for territorial guarantees from major powers. The fate of Ukraine may
suggest to other states in similar positions that their best bet is to
develop a nuclear deterrent rather than count on outside protection.

### Impact\-\--CEE\-\--Yes Global Spillover\-\--A2: Cred Theory False

#### Credibility defense is about [adversaries]{.underline}, not [allies]{.underline}\-\--the audience effect is [empirically proven]{.underline} and [robust]{.underline}

Iain **Henry 14**, PhD Candidate at the Australian National
University\'s Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, MA in Strategic
Studies from Australian National University, Fulbright Scholar, "The
Alliance Audience Effect in America's Asian Alliances", 11-16, p. 3-4

[Recent [scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline} has
[[questioned]{.underline}]{.mark} aspects of [[deterrence theory]{.mark}
and]{.underline} instead [suggests]{.underline} that bac[king down in
one confrontation does not lead an adversary to regard a state as
irresolute]{.underline}, or increase the likelihood of further
challenges. [Authors such as]{.underline} Daryl [[Press
and]{.underline}]{.mark} Jonathan [[Mercer]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[argued]{.mark} that in assessing a state\'s level of resolve, [an
**adversary** is]{.mark} more [likely to consider]{.mark} that state\'s
current]{.underline} interests and [[capabilities, rather
than]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[past actions]{.underline}]{.mark}.2 For
interactions with adversaries, recent scholarship concludes that
credible threats require significant interests and the capabilities
necessary to pursue or protect them. [[However, there has been
**less**]{.mark} **academic [focus]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} another
aspect]{.underline} of international relations - [how a state might
assess the security reliability of [an **ally**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Some authors have argued that states should not worry about whether
allies consider them reliable. Mercer suggests that because
\'Decision-makers do not consistently use another state\'s past
behaviour\...to predict that state\'s behavior\', the United States
should not be concerned about its allies viewing it as irresolute, as
these allies will simply assume that America\'s \'interests and
capabilities determine \[its\] resolve\'.3 Although Press largely
supports Mercer\'s conclusions about adversaries and resolve, he is more
reserved on how allies might assess a state\'s actions. Press notes that
although \'it is critical to know how countries assess the credibility
of their allies,\' this remains a research gap.4

The issue of reliability within alliances is not a completely unexplored
field, but most of the scholarly work focussing on alliance reliability
has examined its connection to alliance formation and termination.
Douglas Gibler looks primarily at the issue of alliance foimation, but
also finds that states with reliable allies are less likely to be
targeted in disputes.5 Gregory Miller finds that unreliable states will
be more constrained by the design of their alliances---allies will
impose tighter alliance controls to compensate for any
unreliability---but it is less clear how this finding assists in
understanding alliance management in situations where the simple
rewriting of an alliance treaty might not be practical.6 For example, it
is hard to conceive how Japan, if it began to doubt American reliability
today, could simply rewrite its alliance with the United States in order
to mitigate the risk of abandonment Brett Leeds has considered the
reliability of alliance commitments in times of war, but the subject of
reliability perceptions within non-wartime alliance management is
relatively unexamined.7

[This article constructs and tests a theory of the \"alliance audience
effect\", which addresses how states might observe their ally\'s
behaviour in order to fonn assessments about its security reliability.
[Drawing on neo-realist]{.mark} alliance [theory]{.mark}]{.underline},
this article argues that [[a state should monitor how their ally behaves
within other]{.mark} alliance [relationships]{.mark} in order [to
form]{.mark} accurate [assessments]{.mark} of]{.underline} the ally1 s
[reliability]{.underline}. Based on these assessments, states should
adopt balancing behaviour in order to mitigate the risks of abandonment
or entrapment [After discussing the deductive basis for these ideas. [I
**test them against**]{.mark} **America\'s [conduct in Asia]{.mark}
between 1949-1951**]{.underline}.

I do not claim that a state\'s observations of allied behaviour will be
the only influence on that state\'s beliefs about the reliability of the
ally. However, [[this]{.mark} article [shows]{.mark} that [states **do
monitor**]{.mark} the [conduct]{.mark} of their ally [and]{.mark} that
these [observations]{.mark} can [influence]{.mark} that state to adopt
[balancing behaviour]{.mark} intended to mitigate the risks posed by the
ally\'s unreliability.]{.underline} I argue that [the [\"alliance
audience\" **exists**, and]{.mark} that [demonstrating
unreliability]{.mark} on the global stage [can have **significant
effects**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The article then concludes by outlining
the current policy relevance of these concepts and suggesting further
areas of research.

A later generation of [[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, departed
from Schelling's analysis. Few scholars question the importance of
credibility per se, if credibility is defined as the perception that the
United States will act to defend its key interests. What they have
[[critiqued]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather, is [the idea that establishing
**[cred]{.mark}**ibility requires]{.underline} regular [demonstrations
of]{.underline} American [resolve]{.underline}, particularly through the
use of force. Some scholars have noted, for instance, that concerns with
resolve and credibility led the United States to undertake
policies---such as escalation in Vietnam---that incurred losses far out
of proportion to the reputational gains.

16 [Others claimed to find little evidence that past demonstrations of
resolve actually mattered in affecting opponents' calculations of
credibility. In one]{.underline} widely read study, Daryl [**Press**
contended that]{.underline} Western [appeasement of Hitler]{.underline}
at Munich [had little]{.underline} or nothing [to do with]{.underline}
his [subsequent aggression]{.underline}, and that Nikita Khrushchev's
repeated climb-downs on Berlin and other issues in the late 1950s had
scant impact on Western perceptions of his resolve.17 Press and other
scholars argued that other variables---the balance of capabilities and
the perceived importance of the interests at stake---were paramount in
determining perceptions of credibility.18 Other scholars have made
similar arguments, claiming that "politicians' persistent belief in the
value of reputation for resolve is merely a cult of reputation," or
even, in an extreme form, that "credibility is an illusion---and an
exceptionally dangerous illusion at that."19

[Such doubts may be most prevalent within the ivory tower, and
relatively **[few policymakers]{.mark} would [share]{.mark} academics'
[skepticism]{.mark}** about the importance of credibility and
demonstrations of resolve]{.underline}.20 Yet it is worth nothing that a
similar skepticism has emerged in some surprising quarters of the
policymaking community of late. As Jeffrey Goldberg wrote in 2016,
then-President Obama believed that the U.S. foreign policy community
"makes a fetish of 'credibility'---particularly the sort of credibility
purchased with force." As the president acidly remarked, "Dropping bombs
on someone to prove that you're willing to drop bombs on someone is just
about the worst reason to use force."21

It would require an extended essay to adjudicate these debates regarding
credibility and its constituent parts. Yet three key points can briefly
be made here. First, and most important, [the more [extreme
critiques]{.mark} of credibility]{.underline} and U.S. policymakers'
preoccupation therewith **[[are badly overstated]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
For one thing, [accepting that credibility is an illusion]{.underline},
or that past behavior has no impact on perceptions of an actor's
subsequent credibility, [[requires accepting]{.mark} that **[normal
rules of]{.mark} human [interaction]{.mark}**---in which past behavior
is crucial to expectations about future behavior---[are]{.mark} simply
**[suspended]{.mark}** in the international arena]{.underline}. If a
person reneges on a commitment, his peers and interlocutors will likely
doubt his sincerity with respect to other commitments; [there is **no
logical reason** to suspect that similar patterns do not prevail in
international politics]{.underline}. For another thing, [deeming
credibility an illusion [requires accepting]{.mark} that **[virtually
all]{.mark} U.S. [officials]{.mark}** [who **think
otherwise**]{.mark}]{.underline}---in part because they know, from
experience, that U.S. allies as well as adversaries are constantly
assessing recent American behavior in hopes of divining what Washington
will do in the next crisis---[[are]{.mark} **simply [mistaken]{.mark}**.
Not least, there is now considerable **[historical analysis]{.mark}**
and **evidence** **[illustrat]{.mark}**ing that **[cred]{.mark}**ibility
**[does matter]{.mark}** and past actions **do indeed** affect
reputations. Scholars have convincingly argued that:]{.underline}

[there has also emerged a [growing]{.mark} body of [social science

"The New Containment: Handling Russia, China, and Iran", Foreign
Affairs, March/April 2019,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-02-12/new-containment

But today's circumstances differ from those of the past in several
important ways. During most of the Cold War, [Washington]{.underline}
confronted a single powerful opponent, the Soviet Union---the leader of
the international communist movement. Now it [must cope with three
separate adversaries]{.underline}, each largely independent of the other
two. [**[Russia]{.mark}** and **[China]{.mark}**]{.underline} cooperate,
but they also [compete]{.underline} with each other.
[[And]{.underline}]{.mark} while both have good relations with
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**, both also have large and potentially
restive Muslim populations, giving them reason to worry about the growth
of Iranian power and influence. Cold War containment was a single global
undertaking, implemented regionally. Contemporary [[containment]{.mark}
will [involve]{.mark}]{.underline} three [separate [**regional**
initiatives]{.mark}, implemented [in
**coordination**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Soviet Union, moreover, presented a strong ideological challenge,
devoted as it was to advancing not just Moscow's geopolitical interests
but also its communist principles. Neither Russia nor China has such a
crusading ideology today. Russia has abandoned communism completely, and
China has done so partially, retaining the notion of party supremacy but
shedding most of the economics and the messianic zeal. And although the
Islamic Republic represents a cause and not just a stretch of territory,
the potential appeal of its ideology is largely limited to the Muslim
world and, primarily, its Shiite minority.

None of today's revisionist powers possesses the Soviet Union's fearsome
military capabilities. Russia is a shrunken version of its older self
militarily, and Iran lacks formidable modern military forces. China's
economic growth may ultimately allow it to match the United States in
all strategic dimensions and pose a true peer threat, but to date,
Beijing is concentrating on developing forces to exclude the United
States from the western Pacific, not to project power globally.
Moreover, the [initiatives [each]{.mark} has [launched so
far]{.mark}---Russia's seizure of Crimea and Middle East meddling,
China's island building, Iran's regional subversion---have been
[**limited probes** rather than]{.mark} **all-out
[assaults]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the existing order.

Lastly, the Soviet Union was largely detached from the U.S.-centered
global economy during the Cold War, whereas today's revisionist powers
are very much a part of it. Russia and Iran have relatively small
economies and export mostly energy, but China has the world's
second-largest economy, with deep, wide, and growing connections to
countries everywhere.

Economic interdependence will complicate containment. China, for
example, may be a political and military rival, but it is also a crucial
economic partner. The United States depends on China to finance its
deficits. China depends on the United States to buy its exports.
Containment in Asia will thus require other policies as well, because
although a Chinese military collapse would enhance Asian security, a
Chinese economic collapse would bring economic disaster.

Together, these differences make today's containment a less urgent
challenge than its Cold War predecessor. The United States does not have
to deal with a single mortal threat from a country committed to remaking
the entire world in its own image. It must address three serious but
lesser challenges, mounted by countries seeking not heaven on earth but
greater regional power and autonomy. But if today's challenges are less
epic, they are far more complicated. The old containment was simple, if
not easy. The new [[containment]{.mark} will [have to **blend**]{.mark}
a variety of [policies, **carefully coordinated**]{.mark}]{.underline}
with one another in design and execution. [[This will **tax**]{.mark}
the]{.underline} ingenuity and [**[flex]{.mark}**ibility [of]{.mark} the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and its
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

STRONGER TOGETHER

As during the Cold War, containment today requires American military
deployments abroad. In Europe, ground troops are needed to deter Russian
aggression. The Putin regime has already sent forces into Georgia and
Ukraine. The United States is committed to protecting its NATO allies.
These include the Baltic states, tiny countries on Russia's border. By
defending them, the United States could encounter some of the same
difficulties it did defending West Berlin, including, in the worst case,
having to decide whether to bring nuclear weapons into play rather than
accept military defeat.

East Asia requires a robust U.S. naval presence to fend off China's
campaign to dominate the western Pacific. The United States is committed
to protecting allies such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan and
maintaining open sea-lanes, and it conducts what it calls
"freedom-of-navigation operations" in international waters newly claimed
by China to make clear that the rest of the world does not accept
Chinese claims and Chinese dominance there.

And in the Middle East, American naval and air forces are needed to
safeguard shipments of Persian Gulf oil to Europe and Asia and to
support a successful rollback of the Iranian nuclear program, should
that become necessary. American troops on the ground are not required;
it is local forces that must check Iranian efforts at regional
subversion (which are carried out by local militias).

[Diplomatically, [Washington needs]{.mark} to **maintain**]{.underline}
or assemble [**broad [coalitions]{.mark}** [of **local powers** to
oppose]{.mark} each revisionist challenge]{.underline}. In Europe, NATO
was created to carry out this very mission and so should be the pillar
of the United States' strategy there. In Asia and the Middle East, [the
"hub and spoke" pattern of]{.underline} American Cold War
[alliances]{.underline} still [exists]{.underline}, even as regional
powers have begun to collaborate among themselves.

Working with partners exploits Washington's greatest strength: its
ability to attract allies and create powerful coalitions against
isolated opponents. [[Coordinating]{.mark} with other
countries]{.underline} also [[endows]{.mark} American
**[fo]{.mark}**reign **[po]{.mark}**licy [with]{.mark} a
**[legitimacy]{.mark}** it would **otherwise lack**]{.underline},
showing that the United States is not simply acting for itself but
defending broad principles of international order that many others
support.

The [[dependence of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[revisionists on]{.mark}
access to [the]{.mark} global **[econ]{.mark}**omy
[gives]{.mark}]{.underline} the United States and its [coalition
[partners]{.mark} a potential source of
**[leverage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Washington and its allies have tried
to exploit this through sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine,
tariffs on China for its trade practices, and sanctions on Iran for its
nuclear weapons program. But interdependence cuts both ways. Russia has
tried to pressure Ukraine by restricting Ukrainian access to Russian
energy. China has placed targeted embargoes on Japan and Norway to
express displeasure with specific Japanese and Norwegian policies.
Moreover, economic instruments have at best a mixed record in achieving
political goals; the broader the sanctioning coalition is, the greater
its impact will be.

MAKING IT OFFICIAL

The prospect of a twenty-first-century triple containment strategy
raises several questions. Since the United States is already doing much
of what is required, how much change in American foreign policy is
needed? Is it necessary or feasible to confront all three revisionist
powers at once? And how does all this end?

As for the first, explicitly committing the United States to containment
would build on many existing policies while reframing them as part of a
coherent national strategy rather than the products of inertia or
inattention. A public commitment to containment would enhance the
credibility of American deterrence and lower the chance of opportunistic
attacks by opponents hoping for easy gains (as happened in Korea in 1950
and Iraq in 1990). That, in turn, would reassure actual and potential
allies and increase their willingness to join the effort. Adopting
containment as a strategic frame would also help restrain Washington's
occasional impulses to do more (try to transform other societies) or
less (retreat from global engagement altogether).

As for confronting all three at once, geopolitical logic and historical
experience suggest that reducing the number of threats is the best
course, as the United States did by joining with the Soviet Union to
defeat the Nazis and then aligning with Mao Zedong's China to defeat the
Soviet Union. Post-Soviet Russia would have been a natural partner for
the West. But Moscow was needlessly alienated from its logical
geopolitical partnership by NATO expansion, which brought foreign armies
to its doorstep over its objections. At this point, [[all
three]{.underline}]{.mark} revisionist regimes [[rely for **domestic
support**]{.underline}]{.mark} on nationalist hostility to the United
States specifically and Western democracies more generally and reject
being part of a U.S.-led coalition. [Fortunately, Russia is]{.underline}
much [weaker]{.underline} than the Soviet Union, [China is
restrained]{.underline} by both deterrence and the knowledge that
military conflict would damage its economy, [and Iran is a regional
power. So the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[can]{.underline} afford to [pursue]{.underline} the [containment of all
three]{.underline} simultaneously (so long as it does so as part of
robust coalitions).

Cold War containment was an open-ended policy with a hoped-for eventual
outcome. The same will be true for the new version: the policy should
continue as long as the threats it is intended to counter continue, and
ideally it will end similarly. [Constructive **[regime
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for example, [especially]{.underline} the
advent of [democracy, [would alter]{.mark}]{.underline} the [foreign
policy [orientations]{.mark}]{.underline} of the revisionist powers.
Such a [change would]{.underline} have to [come]{.underline} about
[[through **internal processes**]{.underline}]{.mark} and is unlikely to
happen anytime soon. Still, none of the regimes can be confident of its
longevity; repeated outbreaks of political turbulence over the years
have shown that each faces significant domestic opposition, maintains
itself in power through coercion, and fears its people rather than
trusts them. [[Situations]{.underline}]{.mark} like that [[can **shift
rapidly**]{.underline}]{.mark}. A well-executed policy of
[[containment]{.mark} could [increase]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[chances
of **disruption**]{.mark} by creating an **external context** that would
**encourage it**]{.underline}. But when or, indeed, if it would bear
fruit is impossible to predict.

Institute for Human Ecology, The Unquiet Frontier: Rising Rivals,
Vulnerable Allies, and The Crisis of American Power, p. 1-6

What is the value of allies at the outer frontier of American power?
Since the end of the Second World War, [the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [has
**[maintain]{.mark}**ed [a **network of alliances**]{.mark} with
vulnerable states situated [near]{.mark} the **[strategic
crossroads]{.mark}**, **choke points**, and **arteries** of the world's
major regions. In **East Asia**]{.underline}, Washington has built
formal and informal security relationships with island and coastal
states dotting the Asian mainland: South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore,
Thailand, the Philippines, as well as midsized offshore powers Japan and
Australia. In [the **Middle East**]{.underline}, it has maintained a
special relationship with democratic ally Israel and security links with
moderate Arab states Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and United
Arab Emirates (UAE). [And in **East- Central Europe**]{.underline}, in
the period since the Cold War, [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has formed alliances with]{.underline} the
group of mostly small, post- communist states--- [Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and
Bulgaria]{.underline}--- that line the Baltic- to- Black- Sea corridor
between Germany and Russia.

Despite their obvious geographic and political dissimilarities, [these
three regional clusters]{.underline} of U.S. allies [**share** a number
of important strategic characteristics]{.underline} (see figure 1.1).
[All are composed of **small** and **midsized** powers]{.underline}
(most have between five and fifty million inhabitants and small
landmass). [Most are **democracies** and **free market**
economies]{.underline} deeply invested in the Bretton Woods global
economic and institutional framework. [[All]{.underline}]{.mark}, to a
greater extent than other U.S. allies, [[occupy]{.mark} **strategically
[important]{.mark} global [real estate]{.mark}**
[along]{.mark}]{.underline} three of [the **world's most contested
geopolitical [fault lines]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Most sit near a
maritime choke point or critical land corridor: the Asian littoral
routes (South China Sea, North China Sea, Sea of Japan, Straits of
Taiwan, Straits of Malacca); the Persian Gulf and eastern Mediterranean;
and the Baltic and Black Seas and space connecting them that underpins
the stability of the western Eurasian littoral.

Perhaps most important from a twenty- first- century U.S. strategic
perspective, [all these allies are located [in]{.mark} close [proximity
to]{.mark} **larger, historically [predatory powers]{.mark}**---
**China**, **Iran**, and **Russia**]{.underline}, respectively--- that
are international competitors to the United States and within whose
respective spheres of influence they would likely fall, should they lose
some or all of their strategic independence. None of these states is
militarily powerful; with the important exceptions of Japan and Israel,
they lack a realistic prospect for military self- sufficiency in any
protracted crisis. [As a result, all **look to the U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, either explicitly or implicitly, [to act as
the **ultimate guarantor** of]{.underline} their [national independence
and **security provider** of last resort]{.underline}.

The view has begun to take root in the United States that these
sprawling alliances are a liability--- either because of the costs that
they impose through the necessity of maintaining a large military and
overseas bases or because of the perils of entrapment in conflicts
involving faraway disputes. Maintaining extensive, expensive, and
binding relationships with exposed and militarily weak states located
near large rivals, we are told, will cause more problems than they are
worth in the geopolitics of the twenty- first century. Citing
nineteenth- century Britain's alleged aloofness to foreign states,
domestic critics of alliances counsel Washington to spurn continental
commitments to small and needy allies. Echoing Prussian chancellor Otto
von Bismarck, these critics warn that the United States must avoid
intervening in conflicts that aren't "worth the bones of a single
Pomeranian grenadier, " whether that conflict be in Estonia or in the
South China Sea.

But these views are wrong--- and dangerous. For the past sixty years
U.S. foreign policy has pursued exactly the opposite course, and for
good reason. The United States has deliberately cultivated bilateral
security linkages with small, otherwise defenseless states strewn across
the world's most hotly contested regions, militarily building them up
and even providing overt guarantees to them. In fact, it has often
seemed to value these states precisely because of their dangerous
locations. During the Cold War America's overriding imperative of
containing the Soviet Union lent geopolitical value to relationships
with even the weakest allies, which in turn utilized U.S. support to
strengthen regional bulwarks against the spread of communist influence.
In the unipolar landscape that followed, the United States surprised
many foreign policy analysts by not only not dismantling this globe-
circling alliance network (as would be expected of a great power after
winning a major war) but actually expanding it through the recruitment
of new allies from among the former communist zone of Central and
Eastern Europe (CEE). In both structural environments, [allies have been
**the "glue"** of the U.S.- led global order]{.underline}: in the Cold
War by containing the Soviet Union and in the post-- Cold War period [by
sustaining]{.underline} the benefits of [**stability** and
**prosperity**]{.underline} that the Cold War victory helped to create.

These alliances have not been cheap for America to maintain, in either
financial or strategic terms. To a greater extent than in relationships
with large, wealthy, insulated states like Britain, Germany, or
Australia, American patronage of frontier states like Poland, Israel,
and Taiwan entails potential strategic costs, insofar as such states lie
at the outer reaches of American power and require recurrent
demonstrations of physical support vis- à- vis would- be aggressors. [To
underwrite]{.underline} the independence and [security]{.underline} of
these states, [the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has
for decades made available a **wide array** of **support**]{.underline}
that includes both "normal" alliance mechanisms--- formal or informal
security guarantees, military basing, coverage under the U.S. nuclear
umbrella--- as well as other special forms of support targeted to the
needs of these states, such as military funding, troop exercises,
forward naval deployments, technology transfers, access to special U.S.
weapons, and various forms of economic, political, and military aid. In
the diplomatic realm, Washington has paid a kind of "sponsorship
premium" for these states, providing backing and support in the regional
disputes in which many inevitably find themselves embroiled. The more
exposed the ally, the higher this sponsorship premium is.

Not surprisingly, critics of an active U.S. foreign policy have often
complained about the expense and risk required for maintaining these
alliances.1 But despite this criticism, America's commitment to these
states has remained steady for the better part of seventy years, making
it one of the most consistent tenets of modern U.S. foreign policy. And
in both strategic and economic terms, it would be hard to argue that the
United States has not gotten a good return on this investment. [[By
exerting]{.mark} a **[strong]{.mark}, benign [presence]{.mark}** [in
**formerly unstable** regions, U.S.]{.mark} patronage of [alliances
in]{.mark} **East [Asia]{.mark}**, the [**Middle East**, and]{.mark}
**East- Central [Europe]{.mark}** has **[help]{.mark}**ed to **[contain
and deter]{.mark} the ambitions of large [rivals]{.mark}**[,
**suppress**]{.mark} **regional [conflicts]{.mark}**[, **keep**]{.mark}
**crucial [trade]{.mark} routes [open]{.mark}**[, and
**promote**]{.mark} **democracy and [rule of law]{.mark}** in historic
conflict zones]{.underline}. In East Asia, the U.S. presence facilitated
pathways of financial investment that contributed to the creation of
some of the world's most dynamic economies and major engines of global
growth while guarding the sea- lanes through which the majority of U.S.-
bound energy supplies and consumer goods pass. [In East- Central Europe,
U.S. efforts to propel [NATO]{.mark} and]{.underline} European Union
[(EU) expansion]{.underline} effectively [**[eliminate]{.mark}**d the
[**geopolitical vacuum** that]{.mark}]{.underline} had [helped to
[generate]{.mark} the [conditions for]{.mark} **three [global
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the twentieth century--- two hot and one
cold. And in the Middle East, U.S. engagement has helped to contain
regional cycles of instability and prevent their spillover into global
energy markets and the American homeland. In both the bipolar and
unipolar international settings, [allies have been **indispensable** to
maintaining]{.underline} the **[global order]{.underline}** that has
allowed for the peace and prosperity of the "American" century.

Part of the reason U.S. patronage of states in these regions has been so
successful is that U.S. allies and potential challengers have understood
that it is unlikely to change suddenly, in large part because of how
deeply encoded in contemporary American strategic thinking has been the
support of small allies. Since the turn of the twentieth century the
United States has invested its strategic resources in a combination of
naval power and, after two world wars, "defense in depth" through a
presence in the Eurasian littorals--- what the midtwentieth- century
American strategist Nicholas Spykman called the global "rimland" (see
figure 1.2). This pattern of forward engagement is not only the basis
for American investment in allies located in the three hinge- point
regions, it is a central tenet of U.S. foreign policy. Building on this
foundation, America, though primarily a maritime power like Britain, has
avoided the island dilemma of being perceived as fickle, retiring, and
unreliable--- in short, of becoming a second "perfidious Albion."

[[But]{.mark} there are signs]{.underline} that [[America
may]{.underline}]{.mark} be beginning to [[rethink]{.mark} its approach
to alliance]{.underline}s. In recent years U.S. policy makers' view of
the relative costs and benefits of maintaining far- flung small- ally
networks has begun to shift. The change is partly [fueled
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} adjustments in global geopolitics and the
"rise" or resurgence of revisionist states, many of which claim to have
historic spheres of influence that overlap with the regions where
America's alliance obligations are highest and its strategic reach most
constrained. Another driver has been the changing U.S. economic
landscape and constraints on the U.S. defense budget, which call into
question whether the United States will continue to maintain the force
structures that have made its geographically widespread alliances
possible to begin with. Finally, and perhaps most important, Washington
appears to be **[[deprioritizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** many of its
longest- standing **[[relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**hips
[with]{.underline} traditional [allies [in pursuit of **grand bargains**
with **large**]{.mark}**- power [rivals]{.mark}**, if necessary [**over
the heads** of]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Seeds of Disorder

[The [**combination** of]{.mark} **intensifying [probes]{.mark}** [and
**fragmenting alliances**]{.mark} threatens to [**unravel important
components** of]{.mark} the [stability of]{.mark} major regions and the
**[wider]{.mark} international [order]{.mark}**. Allowed to
continue]{.underline} on their current path, [security [dynamics]{.mark}
in Eastern Europe and the]{.underline} Western [Pacific could [lead
to]{.mark}]{.underline} negative or even [**[catastrophic
outcomes]{.mark}** for]{.underline} U.S. national [security.
[One]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly likely near-term scenario
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a simmering, [**[simultaneous]{.mark}**
security [competition]{.mark} in **major regions**]{.underline}. In such
a scenario, rivals continue probing allies and grabbing middle-zone
territory while steering clear of war with the United States or its
proxies; allies continue making half-measure preparations without
becoming fully capable of managing their own security; and the United
States continues feeding greater and greater resources into frontline
regions without achieving reassurance, doggedly tested and put in doubt
by the revisionists. Through a continued series of probes, the
revisionist powers maintain the initiative while the United States and
its allies play catch up. [The [result]{.mark} might
[be]{.mark}]{.underline} a gradual hardening of the U.S. security
perimeter that never culminates in a Great Power war but generates many
of the negative features of sustained security competition---[[**arms
races**, **proxy wars**]{.mark}, and **[cyber and hybrid
conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}---that erode the bases of global
economic growth.

[A]{.underline} second, **[grave]{.underline}**r [possibility is
**war**]{.underline}. Historically, [a lengthy series of]{.underline}
successful [probes has often **culminated** in a **military
confrontation**. One **dangerous characteristic**]{.underline} of
today's international landscape [is that **not one but two**
revisionists have]{.underline} now completed protracted sequences of
[probes]{.underline} that, from their perspective, have been successful.
If the purpose of probing is to assess the top power's strength,
[today's probes could]{.underline} eventually [convince either
**Russia**, **China**, or **both** that the time is ripe for a more
definitive contest]{.underline}. It is uncertain what the outcome would
be. [Force [ratios in]{.mark}]{.underline} today's two

with a ten-to-one Russian troop advantage in the Baltic and massive
Chinese preponderance of coastal short-range missiles in the South China
Sea. Moreover, [both powers possess **[nuc]{.mark}lear

[doctrine favoring]{.mark}]{.underline} their **[[escalatory

States can maintain overwhelming military superiority in a dyadic
contest, war is always the realm of chance and a source of destruction
that threatens the stability of the existing international order. Having

prospect of either [a **short, [sharp war]{.mark}** [that culminates in

protracted two-front conflict. Either outcome would definitely alter the
U.S.-led international system as we know it.

### Impact\-\--CEE\-\--A2: Impact Defense\-\--Asia War

#### Defense doesn't assume [security dilemmas]{.underline}, which [escalate]{.underline} through [miscalc]{.underline} and [misperception]{.underline}\-\--nothing checks

Dr. Andrew T. H. **Tan 15**, Associate Professor in the Department of
Security Studies at the University of New South Wales, Security and
Conflict in East Asia, May 2015,
https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781315850344-3

Conclusion: implications of the arms race in East Asia

[East [Asia's arms race leads to the]{.mark} classic]{.underline}
problem of the [**[security dilemma]{.mark}**, in which a state that is
perceived as becoming too powerful leads to counter-acquisitions by
other states. [This results in **misperceptions**, **conflict
spirals**]{.mark}, **heightened [tensions]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
ultimately **[open conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thereby destroying
the very security that arms are supposed to guarantee (Jervis 1976).
[East Asia's sustained economic rise]{.underline} since the end of the
Korean War in 1953 [and]{.underline} the [lack of]{.underline} any
[major conflict since has lulled many into believing that growing
[economic interdependence]{.mark} will make war unlikely in that
region]{.underline} (Khoo 2013: 47--48). [However, this [is]{.mark} a
**[false]{.mark} premise** [as]{.mark} significant **[historical
antagonisms]{.mark}** have [remained]{.mark}. Japan's
imperialism]{.underline} prior to 1945 and its failure adequately to
account for its past [continues to stir up strong **nationalist
emotions** in China and South Korea]{.underline}. In addition, the
divisions between North Korea and South Korea are as strong and
intractable as ever, leading to an arms race on the Korean peninsula.

[The situation is [compounded by]{.mark} the]{.underline} weakness or
**[[absence of]{.mark} regional [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
regimes and laws that could regulate interstate relations, build trust
and confidence, and otherwise put a stop to the arms race. None of the
distinctive confidence- and security-building measures which were in
place in Europe during the Cold War and helped to calm tensions as well
as contain the arms race exist in Asia. Within East Asia itself, the
Six-Party Talks have focused only on the Korean issue and have not
managed to stem North Korea's open brinkmanship that in early 2013
almost brought the Korean peninsula to war again.

[The [arms race]{.mark} in East Asia [is dangerous owing to]{.mark} the
increased [risk of **miscalc**]{.mark}**ulation** [as a result of
**misperception**. Chinese policymakers appear]{.mark} to be [convinced
that Japan]{.mark} is dominated by [right-wing]{.mark} conservatives
bent on reviving militarism]{.underline} (Glosserman 2012). At the same
time, [[there is]{.mark} also [a perception]{.mark} within
[China]{.mark} that given its growing strength, it [should]{.mark} now
aggressively [assert]{.mark} what it perceives to be [its]{.mark}
legitimate [claims in the **E**]{.mark}]{.underline}ast [[and
**S**]{.underline}]{.mark}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**eas. Thus, China's nationalist discourse
perceives that the problems about disputed territory emanate from other
powers, not China (Sutter 2012). [The consequences of [conflict between
China and Japan]{.mark}, on]{.underline} the [Korea]{.underline}n
peninsula [or over Taiwan, however, [will **not stay regional**]{.mark}.
As a key player in East Asia, the [USA]{.mark}, which has security
commitments to Japan and South Korea, residual commitments to Taiwan,
and troops on the ground in East Asia and in the Western Pacific, [will
be **drawn in**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The problem is that [[any
conflict]{.mark} in East Asia is **not likely** to remain conventional
for long. In fact, it is likely that it [would **rapidly escalate**
into]{.mark} a **[nuclear war]{.mark}** because three of the **key
players**, namely **China**, **North Korea** and the **USA**, possess
nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

#### There are [no brakes]{.underline} on escalation\-\--global nuclear war

Shar **Adams 14**, Reporter for the Epoch Times, Citing Desmond Ball,
Professor in the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at the Australian
National University, "Asian Cold War: Escalating Conflict in North-East
Asia Bigger Threat Than War on Terror", Epoch Times, 10-13,
http://m.theepochtimes.com/n3/1014683-asian-cold-war-escalating-conflict-in-north-east-asia-bigger-threat-than-war-on-terror/

The world may be focused on the "war on terror", but [the arms build up
in North-East [Asia poses a]{.mark} far [great]{.mark}er [threat to
**global stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}, says Professor Desmond Ball,
a senior defence and security expert at the Australian National
University (ANU).

A former head of ANU's Strategic & Defence Studies Centre, Professor
Ball is no lightweight when it comes to security concerns. It is
Professor Ball's [expertise in **[c]{.mark}**ommand [and
**c**]{.mark}ontrol systems]{.underline}, particularly in relation to
nuclear war, that [[underlies]{.underline}]{.mark} his
[[concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} about North-East Asia.

["North-East [Asia has]{.mark} now [become the **most disturbing part of
the globe**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Prof Ball told Epoch Times in an
exclusive interview.

[[China, Japan and]{.mark} South [Korea]{.mark} -- countries that are
"**economic [engines of the global economy]{.mark}**[" -- are embroiled
in an **arms race**]{.mark} **of unprecedented proportions**, punctuated
by "very dangerous military activities"]{.underline}, he says.

[Unlike the arms race seen during the Cold War, however, there are **[no
mechanisms]{.mark} in place to [constrain]{.mark} the military
[escalation]{.mark}** in Asia]{.underline}.

["Indeed, the **[escalation]{.mark} dynamic** [could **move**]{.mark}
**very [rapidly]{.mark} and strongly [to large scale]{.mark} conflict**,
including **[nuclear conflict]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} said Prof Ball.
["It is happening as we watch."]{.underline}

Arms Race

[Military spending in Asia has grown steadily over the last
decade]{.underline}. According to a 2013 Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute report, China is now the world's second largest
military spender behind the United States, spending an estimated \$188
billion in 2013.

Japan and South Korea are also among the world's top 10 military
spenders. When North Korea and Taiwan are included, [North-East Asian
countries constitute around 85 per cent of military spending in
Asia]{.underline}.

But what is more disturbing, Prof Ball says, is the motivation for the
acquisitions.

"[The primary reason]{.underline} now for the acquisitions, whether they
are air warfare destroyers, missiles or defense submarines, [is simply
to match what the other \[countries\] are getting]{.underline}," he
said.

While he believes it is likely that Japan would have embarked on
military modernisation, he says it is China's military provocation of
countries across Asia that is fuelling the build-up.

Since [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} lay claim to all of the South China
Sea, it [has [escalated **territorial disputes**]{.mark}]{.underline}
with Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia.

[What started with skirmishes between locals and Chinese fishing boats
or navy vessels has now become territorial grabs]{.underline} -- island
building on contested rocky outcrops.

In a sign of things to come, the South China Morning Post reported in
June: "China is looking to expand its biggest installation in the
Spratly Islands into a fully formed artificial island, complete with
airstrip and sea port, to better project its military strength in the
South China Sea."

According to Filipino media, the artificial island falls within the
Philippines' 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone.

Prof Ball says China's behaviour in the South China Sea is provocative,
but "in the scale of what we are talking about, that is nothing"
compared with conflicts in North-East Asia, where [China and [Japan are
contesting]{.mark} claims over [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
Tokyo-controlled **[[Senkaku Islands]{.underline}]{.mark}** (claimed as
the Diaoyus by China).

Of the Senkakus conflict, Prof Ball says: "[We are talking about
**actual footsteps towards nuclear war**]{.underline} -- submarines and
missiles."

Chinese and Japanese activity in the Senkakus region has escalated to
the point where sometimes [there are "at least 40 aircraft jostling"
over the contested area]{.underline}, he said.

Alarm bells were set off near the Senkakus in January last year when a
Chinese military vessel trained its fire-control radar on a Japanese
naval destroyer. The incident spurred the Japanese Defense Ministry to
go public about that event and reveal another incident from a few days
prior, when a Chinese frigate directed fire-control radar at a Japanese
military helicopter.

Fire-control radars are not like surveillance or early warning radars --
they have one purpose and that is to lock onto a target in order to fire
a missile. "Someone does that to us, we fire back," Prof Ball said.

Counter Measures Needed

Prof Ball is recognised for encouraging openness and transparency, and
for his advocacy of multilateral institutions. He has been called one of
the region's "most energetic and activist leaders in establishing forums
for security dialogue and measures for building confidence".

In his experience visiting China over the years, however, Prof Ball says
[gaining open [dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline} and transparency [with
Chinese military leaders [is **difficult**]{.mark}]{.underline}. He
recounted a private meeting with a Chinese admiral shortly after the
fire-control radar incident. Prof Ball had seen direct evidence of the
encounter -- "tapes of the radar frequencies, the pulse rates and the
pulse repetition frequencies" -- and wanted to know what had happened on
the Chinese side and why it took place.

"In a private meeting, I asked the admiral why ... and he denied it to
my face," Prof Ball said. The Chinese admiral would not even concede
that an incident had happened.

"I don't see the point of this sort of dialogue," he added.

[[With **so many players**]{.mark} in the region [and **few barriers
against**]{.mark} **conflict [escalation]{.mark}**, the North-East
[Asia]{.mark}n nuclear arms race [is]{.mark} **now [far more]{.mark}
complex and [dangerous]{.mark}** than the Cold War]{.underline}, he
says.

[In the Cold War, there were mechanisms at each level of potential
confrontation, including a direct hotline]{.underline} between the US
and Soviet leaders.

"[Once things get serious here, [\[there is\] **nothing to slow things
down**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the contrary, [[you have all]{.mark} the
[incentives to **go first**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said.

### Impact\-\--CEE\-\--A2: Impact Defense\-\--Russia War

#### Regional conflicts [escalate]{.underline}. Risk is [especially high]{.underline} now AND deterrence doesn't check.

George **Beebe 19**, Vice President and Director of Studies at the
Center for the National Interest, Former Head of Russia Analysis at the
CIA, and Author of The Russia Trap: How Our Shadow War with Russia Could
Spiral into Nuclear Catastrophe, "We're More at Risk of Nuclear War With
Russia Than We Think", Politico, 10/7/2019,
https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/10/07/were-more-at-risk-of-nuclear-war-with-russia-than-we-think-229436

Today, that old dread of disaster has all but disappeared, as have the
systems that helped preclude it. But [the actual [threat of]{.mark}
nuclear [catastrophe is]{.mark} much **[great]{.mark}**er than we
realize. Diplomacy]{.underline} and a desire for global peace [have
given way to **complacency** and a **false sense of security** that
nuclear escalation is outside the realm of possibility. That leaves
us]{.underline} unprepared for---and [**highly vulnerable** to---a
nuclear attack from Russia]{.underline}.

[The most recent sign]{.underline} of American complacency [was the
death]{.underline}, a few weeks ago, [of the
**I**]{.underline}ntermediate-Range **[N]{.underline}**uclear
**[F]{.underline}**orces [Treaty]{.underline}---a pivotal 1987 agreement
that introduced intrusive on-site inspection provisions, destroyed an
entire class of dangerous weaponry, and convinced both Washington and
Moscow that the other wanted strategic stability more than strategic
advantage. The [New START]{.underline} treaty, put in place during the
Obama administration, [appears headed for a similar fate]{.underline} in
2021. In fact, [nearly all]{.underline} the [key]{.underline}
U.S.-Russian [arms control and confidence-building
provisions]{.underline} of the Cold War era [are **dead**]{.underline}
or on life support, with little effort underway to update or replace
them.

Meanwhile, U.S. officials from both parties are focused not on how we
might avoid nuclear catastrophe but on showing how tough they can look
against a revanchist Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin. Summit
meetings between White House and Kremlin leaders, once viewed as
opportunities for peace, are now seen as dangerous temptations to
indulge in Munich-style appeasement, the cardinal sin of statecraft.
American policymakers worry more about "going wobbly," as Margaret
Thatcher once put it, than about a march of folly into inadvertent war.
President Donald Trump's suggestion that the United States and Russia
might explore ways to manage their differences diplomatically has
produced mostly head-scratching and condemnation.

In my more than 25 years of government experience working on Russia
matters, I've seen that three [[**misguided** assumptions]{.mark}
underlie]{.underline} how the United States got to this point.

The [first]{.underline} is that American policymakers think [[that
because neither]{.mark} side **[wants]{.mark}** nuclear [war,
then]{.mark}]{.underline} such a [war is very
[unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline} to occur. [Russia would be
foolish]{.underline}, we reason, [to]{.underline} cross swords with the
powerful U.S. military and [risk]{.underline} its own
[self-destruction]{.underline}, and many Americans find it hard to
imagine that modern cyber duels, proxy battles, information operations
and economic warfare might somehow erupt into direct nuclear attacks. If
the Cold War ended peacefully, the thinking goes, why should America
worry that a new shadow war with a much less formidable Russia will end
any differently?

[**[But]{.mark}** wars do not always begin by **design**. Just
[as]{.mark}]{.underline} they did [[in]{.mark} 19[**14**, a]{.mark}
**vicious [circle]{.mark}** [of **clashing**]{.mark} **geopolitical
[ambitions]{.mark}**[, **distorted perceptions**]{.mark} of each other's
intent, **[new]{.mark} and poorly understood [tech]{.mark}nologies**,
[and **disappearing rules**]{.mark} **of the game** [could
**combine**]{.mark} to produce a **disaster** that neither side wants
nor expects]{.underline}.

In fact, **[[cyber]{.mark} tech]{.underline}**nologies,
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence, advanced **[[hypersonic]{.mark}
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** delivery systems [[and
**a**]{.underline}]{.mark}nti**[[sat]{.underline}]{.mark}**ellite
[weaponry are **[mak]{.mark}**ing the U.S.-Russian shadow [war]{.mark}
**much more [complex]{.mark}** and **dangerous** than the old Cold War
competition]{.underline}. They are [blurring]{.underline} traditional
[lines]{.underline} between espionage and warfare,
[**[entangling]{.mark}** nuclear and conventional [weaponry]{.mark}, and
erasing]{.underline} old [distinctions between offensive and defensive
operations. [Whereas]{.mark}]{.underline} the development of nuclear
weaponry in the Cold War produced the concept of
**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**utually **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**ssured
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction and [had a
**[restrain]{.mark}**ing effect, [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} arena, [playing [**offense**
is]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly seen as [the [best]{.mark} defense.
And]{.underline} in a highly connected world in which financial
networks, commercial operations, media platforms, and [[nuclear
**c**]{.underline}]{.mark}ommand [[and **c**]{.underline}]{.mark}ontrol
[[systems are]{.underline}]{.mark} all **[[linked]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in some way, [[escalation]{.mark} from]{.underline} the
[cyber]{.underline} world into the physical domain [[is]{.mark} a
**[serious]{.mark} danger**]{.underline}.

Cyber technology is also magnifying fears of our adversaries' strategic
intentions while prompting [[questions about]{.mark} whether **[warning
systems]{.mark}** can detect]{.underline} incoming [attacks]{.underline}
and whether weapons will fire when buttons are pushed. This [[makes
**containing**]{.mark} a [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} that might arise
between U.S. and Russian forces [[over **Ukraine**, **Iran** or
**anything else**]{.mark} **much more [difficult]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
It is not hard to imagine [a crisis scenario]{.underline} in which
Russia cyber operators gain access to a satellite system that controls
both U.S. conventional and nuclear weapons systems,
**[[leaving]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[America]{.underline}]{.mark}**n side
[[uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark} about whether the intrusion is meant to
gather information about U.S. war preparations or to disable our ability
to conduct nuclear strikes. [This]{.underline} could
[[cause]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S. president to wonder whether he
faces an urgent [**["use it or lose it"]{.mark}** nuclear launch
decision]{.underline}. It doesn't help that the [[lines of
**comm**]{.mark}unication]{.underline} between the United States and
Russia [necessary for managing]{.underline} such [situations
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} all but **[[severed]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### [Strategic]{.underline} escalation is likely and, if not, [tactical use]{.underline}\-\--plus [even conventional]{.underline} war in the [Baltics]{.underline} goes [global]{.underline} and triggers [nuclear war]{.underline} in [other]{.underline} regions

[Following Russia's annexation of Crimea and its destabilisation of
eastern Ukraine, a military [confrontation]{.mark} between Russia and
the West [over]{.mark} the [**Baltic states** is **no longer
unthinkable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Under what circumstances could this
happen? How would such a conflict play out, and what might happen once
such a war ended? [The notion of large-scale **[war]{.mark}**fare in
Europe -- **[even without]{.mark} the [nuclear]{.mark} dimension** --
would [send **shockwaves** **around the world**]{.mark}, threatening [to
**overturn the entire**]{.mark} **post-Cold War
[order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [If]{.underline} the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation ([NATO]{.underline}) [failed to defend the
Baltics]{.underline} or were to lose against Russia, [then [**Asia**
and]{.mark} the [**Middle East** would]{.mark} also [be
**destabilised**]{.mark}, as doubts grew over the reliability of the US
as an ally. This would [usher in a]{.mark} much more **[unstable]{.mark}
geopolitical [climate]{.mark}**, akin to the **1930s**]{.underline}. It
is highly doubtful that Russia seeks armed conflict with the West, so
any move against the Baltics would be the result of miscalculation on
its part. The Ukraine conflict showed that Russia increasingly views the
plight (whether real or perceived) of ethnic Russians abroad as a
possible pretext for intervention in neighbouring states. Ethnic
Russians comprise a quarter of the populations of Estonia and Latvia.
Scores of thousands of ethnic Russians there have not been granted
citizenship. There is thus considerable angst in the Baltic states about
future Russian military intervention. Russia Feels Threatened By NATO
Source: BMI Research How Might Conflict Begin? [Potential triggers for
Russian intervention include violent clashes between Baltic nationals
and ethnic Russians, new laws that downgrade the status of ethnic
Russians, a shoot-out between border troops or a confrontation between
Russian and NATO aircraft over the Baltic Sea]{.underline}. It is not
known whether a potential Russian move against the Baltics would target
all three states, or just one or two. Overall, Russian intervention in
the Baltics could assume two main forms: 1) Deniable destabilisation
efforts: The Kremlin is accused of instigating unrest between
pro-Russian separatists and non-Russians in eastern Ukraine, dispatching
experienced military and intelligence personnel to direct pro-Russian
forces and providing arms and training to separatists. These processes
are thought to have deployed several thousand troops into the area.
Russia could conceivably seek to repeat this formula in the Baltics, and
after weeks or months of violence, could demand a settlement that would
give ethnic Russians more power over the domestic and foreign policies
of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; or it could deploy a small
'peace-keeping' force to restore order. However, I believe that any
Kremlin attempt to galvanise ethnic Russians in the Baltics would be
much more difficult than in eastern Ukraine, because the Baltic states
have far higher standards of living and governance. Russia's seizure of
Crimea has not triggered any mobilisation of Baltic Russians for closer
ties with Russia. Baltics' Relative Prosperity Positive For Stability.
(Per capital GDP) Source: National governments/BMI 2) Swift occupation:
Alternatively, Russia could occupy the Baltic states in a swift
operation that met little resistance, due to the small size of the
latter's armed forces. However, a purely 'out of the blue' occupation is
unlikely, as the Kremlin would be hard pressed to justify this. A less
dramatic version of this scenario would involve Russian troop
deployments into parts of Estonia and Latvia close to the Russian border
that have significant ethnic Russian populations, or the seizure of key
infrastructure such as ports, airports, and railways. How Would The West
Respond? Russian actions against the Baltics would present the US and
European countries with their biggest foreign policy crisis in decades,
because they are committed to the defence of NATO members. According to
Article 5 of the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty: "The Parties agree that an
armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America
shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they
agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of
the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article
51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or
Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert
with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the
use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North
Atlantic area." However, Russia's deniable destabilisation might not
automatically or universally be viewed as an 'armed attack'. In
addition, the term 'action as it deems necessary' does not guarantee a
military response. Thus, NATO's top decision makers could first resort
to sanctions and diplomacy. Nevertheless, given that most NATO members
understand Article 5 as providing a robust security guarantee, any
backtracking by the alliance from its expected commitments would cripple
its credibility. From NATO's point of view, it would make more sense to
deploy troops to the Baltic states at the first sign of inter-ethnic
unrest, to deter Russia from escalating any trouble-making or from
sending its own troops. Source: BMI Research Although a Russian move
into the Baltics would be a clear act of aggression, I would anticipate
significant opposition in many Western countries to military action,
[[due to]{.mark} the risks of a **[nuc]{.mark}lear [exchange]{.mark}**[,
or]{.mark} at the very least, a **[large]{.mark}-scale [conventional
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. NATO might thus have to assemble a
'coalition of the willing', which would need to include the US, despite
its war-weariness after fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. How Would The
War Play Out? I believe that [NATO's leading members would ultimately go
to war to end Russian military activities in the Baltic
states]{.underline}. However, a major question is whether Russia and
NATO would be able to contain the fighting to the Baltic states. [Russia
could attack Poland or seize]{.underline} the [Swedish]{.underline} land
of [Gotland]{.underline} in the Baltic Sea (see map), [and NATO could
strike targets in Russia]{.underline}. [The biggest danger would be the
use of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Of course, the trigger for this is
not known, but [any such action would likely involve
tactical]{.underline} (i.e. battlefield) [nuclear weapons]{.underline},
rather than strategic ones (which are designed to be used against
cities). [[Even if 'only' **tactical**]{.mark} weapons [were used,
this]{.mark} would [lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} public alarm across the
northern hemisphere, as fears mounted over [[escalation towards]{.mark}
a **[strategic]{.mark} nuclear [exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [A
shooting war between Russia and the West would send shockwaves through
the **global economy**]{.underline}, as the post-Cold War order in
Europe was torn up. [Two-way imposition of sanctions and the disruption
of air and maritime transportation in northern Europe would severely
disrupt **international trade**. **Oil prices** would surge, on
assumptions that Russia's hydrocarbon exports would be taken off the
market or disrupted]{.underline}. [The European economy would be very
hard hit by disruptions to gas imports from Russia]{.underline},
especially if this were to happen in winter. A move by Moscow to cut
Europe's energy supplies [would also severely damage the Russian
government's income]{.underline}. What Would Happen After a War?
[Implications of a Russian victory: Russia's triumph over the most
powerful military alliance in the world could prompt]{.underline}
several Eastern European countries in the EU to reach some sort of
accommodation with Moscow. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan would probably accept Moscow's hegemony in Eurasia. A
victorious Kremlin could then press the US and EU for some sort of
formal division of Europe into rival spheres of influence. Europe would
be set for [a multi-decade new Cold War]{.underline}, although this
would not be global in scope, because Europe's economic importance has
declined substantially since the 1980s. Also, there would be no
ideological dimension to the new struggle. [In **Russia**]{.underline},
the president would bask in the success of re-establishing control of
the Baltic republics, and patriotic fervour would surge, but [the
**economy** would be devastated by major Western sanctions. Given rising
economic pressures, the president could steer Russia towards formal
authoritarianism]{.underline}. [Elsewhere, the [unreliability]{.mark} of
collective security treaties would encourage [**Japan** and
**So**]{.mark}**uth [Ko]{.mark}rea** [to]{.mark} bolster their defences
against China and North Korea]{.underline} respectively, probably [by
**[develop]{.mark}**ing their own [**nuclear arsenals**. Similar]{.mark}
trends would play out in the Middle East, [where **Saudi
Arabia**]{.mark} and several of its neighbours f[ear]{.mark} the
consequences of a nuclear **[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Western [[alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} [admitted North Macedonia as
its]{.underline} newest---and
[weakest]{.underline}---[member]{.underline}. In so doing, [it [has
given]{.mark}]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [[Putin a]{.mark}
terrific [opportunity to]{.mark} expand his influence]{.underline},
further [**[erode NATO's unity]{.underline}**, **[and test the bloc's
commitment]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to defend a member of the
alliance.]{.underline}

[[North Macedonia]{.mark} is the definition of a weak link and easy
pickings]{.underline} for an adversary. A landlocked country of 2
million inhabitants, it has weak political institutions and only a short
history of independence. As of 2018, it spent only 1 percent of its
GDP on defense---short of the 2 percent NATO guideline---and had
just 8,000 active-duty soldiers. [There is simmering communal tension
between a Slavic Orthodox majority and a sizable ethnic
Albanian]{.underline}, [mainly]{.underline} [Muslim]{.underline}
[minority]{.underline}, **[making it vulnerable to
interference]{.underline}**. Within NATO, [only]{.underline} neighboring
[Albania has a]{.underline} lower per capita GDP and a [higher level
of corruption]{.underline}. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy
Index ranks North Macedonia as having Europe's least developed political
culture.Russia has held massive war games that were only thinly
disguised simulations of attacks on NATO members such as Poland and the
Baltic States.

Moscow has viewed NATO's expansion in Eastern Europe with suspicion
since the 1990s. Yet it wasn't until the 2000s, after Russia's military
and economy rebounded from the chaos of the post-Soviet era, that Putin
declared NATO's eastward expansion a "direct threat" and openly
confronted the alliance. [Russia's invasion of
[Georgia]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2008---not coincidentally, the year
that NATO declared an interest in Georgia's eventual accession to the
alliance---[stopped the bloc's expansion]{.underline} into former
Soviet-controlled areas in its tracks. [Putin's]{.underline} 2014
invasion of Ukraine and subsequent [annexation of
[Crimea]{.mark}]{.underline}, while not a direct assault on a NATO
member, further **[[demonstrated Western
impotence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the face of Russian aggression.
Further north, Russia has held massive war games that military experts
say were thinly disguised simulations of attacks on NATO members such as
Poland and the Baltic States.

Now that North Macedonia has joined NATO, [[Putin appears to]{.mark} be
relishing his]{.underline} first [chance to [prove that **the alliance
is** ]{.mark}**little more than [a paper tiger]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In 2018, Russia's ambassador to North Macedonia declared the country a
"legitimate target" if tensions between NATO and Russia were to
increase. But there was no "if" about it: Even before North Macedonia
became a member, [Russia had]{.underline} already [been working
assiduously to ratchet up tensions in the region]{.underline}. [Moscow
has]{.underline} shipped S-400 anti-aircraft missiles to neighboring
Serbia for joint Russian-Serbian military drills[, facilitated an
attempted coup]{.underline} in Montenegro, and tried to destabilize
Bosnia and Herzegovina by [stoking sectarian tensions]{.underline}. And
in North Macedonia itself, [Russia has funded **troll
factories**]{.underline} [that]{.underline}, among other things, [were
used to]{.underline} target the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign with
**[disinformation]{.underline}**. Moscow also tried to influence North
Macedonia's September 2018 referendum on NATO membership, is using its
embassy and consulates there as bases
for [intelligence-gathering ope]{.underline}rations, [and has spread
propaganda]{.underline} detailing alleged Western plots to break up the
country.

That Russia would threaten NATO's members in Eastern Europe is nothing
new, of course. Russia has long attempted to undermine the Baltic
countries---Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia---which joined NATO and the
European Union after gaining their independence from the Soviet Union.
But today, the Baltic States are well integrated into alliance
structures and the European economy and are home to thousands of NATO
troops. Whereas the Baltics have become part of NATO's well-armored
front, the Balkans are its soft underbelly.

Whereas the Baltics have become part of NATO's well-armored front, the
Balkans are its soft underbelly.

 [NATO's posture]{.underline} in North Macedonia and its neighborhood
[is very limited.]{.underline} The Balkan countries are also poorer,
more ethnically divided, and less economically integrated with Europe.
[Their potential instability]{.underline} and the much lower likelihood
of a robust response by the West [make]{.underline} North Macedonia and
its neighbors ripe and **[easy targets for Russian
meddling.]{.underline}**

Taking a page from history's playbook, Putin rightly assumes that most
decision-makers in NATO capitals would consider North Macedonia a
"faraway country" of "people of whom we know nothing." U.S. President
Donald Trump, whose relationship with Putin continues to attract
attention, confirmed a similar suspicion with regard to neighboring
Montenegro when he appeared to question NATO's commitment to defend the
Balkan nation during an interview aired on Fox News. And while some may
have taken offense at Trump's statement, the truth is he speaks for
many.

According to a February poll by the Pew Research Center, [less than
half]{.underline} the populations of [France, Spain, Turkey, and Greece
hold a favorable view of NATO.]{.underline} Pandering to the alliance's
critics, French President Emmanuel [Macron]{.underline} last
year [declared that NATO had "brain death."]{.underline} The citizens of
[only three European countries]{.underline}---Britain, the Netherlands,
and Lithuania---[say their country should respond with military force if
Russia were to attack a NATO member in Eastern Europe.]{.underline}

No surprise then that **[[NATO's posture]{.underline}]{.mark}** toward
its newest member **[[remains unclear]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Though
[NATO broadened]{.mark}]{.underline} the definition of its joint defense
commitment---**[[Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the alliance's
charter---**[[to include cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** in 2014,
**[[it has failed to clarify]{.mark} just [what that
means]{.mark}.]{.underline}** When asked what level of cyberattack on
one of its members would trigger a response, NATO Secretary-General Jens
[Stoltenberg said]{.underline} only, "[We will see]{.underline}."
[The]{.underline} 2018 [Brussels Declaration reaffirmed NATO's
intent]{.underline} to defend member states from nonconventional
attacks---**[but only meekly asserted that in "cases of hybrid
warfare]{.underline}**, [the Council could decide to invoke Article
5.]{.underline}" **[These Western weasel words]{.underline}** will
**[have been duly noted in the Kremlin]{.underline}**.

These Western weasel words will have been duly noted in the Kremlin.

[The type of meddling Russia]{.underline} has specialized in
[includes]{.underline} **[[election interference]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[**[inflaming ethnic tensions]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[provoking violent
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [These]{.underline} three [real
possibilities [could trigger a NATO response]{.mark} under Article
5.]{.underline} [The most pressing issue is]{.underline} securing [North
Macedonia's upcoming elections]{.underline}, now postponed until further
notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Polls last showed VMRO-DPMNE,
a pro-Russian nationalist party, in a dead heat with
the pro-Western Social Democrats. Russian interference in the election
process or outcome not only threatens Macedonian sovereignty but, if
successful, could result in a government that tilts North Macedonia
toward Moscow.

[Russia may also seek to pressure and destabilize]{.underline} North
Macedonia in other ways, including through Moscow's regional client,
Serbia. [Russian propaganda]{.underline} aimed at North Macedonia
[includes conspiracy theories about the]{.underline} country's sizable
Albanian [minority supposedly colluding with NATO]{.underline} and
Albania to fold North Macedonia into a "greater Albania" amid great
bloodshed. As any student of Balkan history knows, [such rhetoric has
led to ethnic violence in the region before]{.underline}. Alternatively,
[Russia may stoke simmering conflicts]{.underline} in Serbia, whose
unstable Presevo region directly borders North Macedonia, or the
unresolved Kosovo dispute. Either conflict could easily spill into North
Macedonia.

NATO's next steps to secure its new member could include adapting the
successful tactics used when Montenegro joined the alliance in 2017. A
NATO-sponsored cyberteam provided the Montenegrin government with
technical support to learn to identify and counter hybrid warfare. NATO
raised awareness of the benefits of NATO membership by working with
officials, civil society, local governments, and media organizations. It
also worked to improve governance in Montenegro's defense sector.
Similarly, the European Union, which has just opened accession talks
with North Macedonia, could move quickly to signal to the world that the
Balkan nations are an integral part of Europe.

More broadly, however, NATO needs a mechanism to respond to Russian
aggression in the event that the alliance's members can't unanimously
agree to do so. **[[Article 5 requires unanimity]{.underline}]{.mark}**
before invoking collective defense, **[[but NATO's members
differ]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in their attitudes to
Russia.]{.underline}

Article 5 requires unanimity before invoking collective defense, but
NATO's members differ in their attitudes to Russia.

 One solution would be to form, as a backstop in case it is needed, a
coalition of the willing comprising NATO members with credible defense
capabilities that are willing to confront Russia and prepare a
collective response to any attack.

Despite NATO's overall military superiority, it has a weak hand in the
Balkans, and Russia continues to outmaneuver it there. NATO must quickly
signal that it remains steadfast and, having decided to admit it, that
North Macedonia is an integral member of the alliance. **[[If NATO fails
in its support of new members]{.underline}]{.mark}** like North
Macedonia, [the chances have just risen that [it will be met with
Russian]{.mark} [aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}---[hybrid]{.underline}
or conventional---**[[that may]{.mark} just mean the [end]{.mark} of
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[as a **credible
alliance**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### The Chinese hybrid crisis makes the link inevitable

Bosch Senior Visiting Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center on the United
States and Europe, 1/25/21, Retooling America's alliances to manage the
China challenge,

Edited ableist language

[China has]{.underline} now [been added to the alliance's]{.underline}
**[ever-expanding agenda]{.underline}**, providing a surprising point of
agreement in an otherwise contentious December 2019 NATO summit, at
which NATO members committed the alliance for the first time to deal
with China's "growing influence and international policies." In April
2020, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg charged an independent
"Reflection Group" with preparing a report eyeing the future; released
in November, the "NATO 2030" document put the challenge in stark terms:
"China is... best understood as a full-spectrum systemic rival, rather
than a purely economic player or an only Asia-focused security actor."

**[Obvious [questions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[remain]{.underline}
[about the]{.underline}]{.mark} [precise [role NATO should play]{.mark}
vis-à-vis China]{.underline}. There are certainly a host of global
security concerns --- ranging from China's presence in Africa and South
Asia to its influence in space and cyberspace --- where NATO
coordination would be valuable. It is unclear, however, what role NATO
could, or would, play in an Asian military crisis with Beijing. [NATO
allies have limited]{.underline} military [capabilities]{.underline}
they could bring to bear in the Pacific, and [**[few European
partners]{.underline}** [would be eager to be pulled into a
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} in places like Taiwan or the South China
Sea. [[Given]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[Article
V]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the 1949 Washington Treaty refers to "an
armed attack against one or more \[NATO members\] in Europe or North
America," a Pacific conflict, even involving U.S. forces, would
technically fall outside NATO's scope. But in [a spiralling
crisis]{.underline} that [would implicate Europe's strategic and
economic interests]{.underline}, could NATO afford to remain on the
sidelines? At a minimum, Europe could play a valuable role in the
political, economic, or even cyberspace arenas. As European allies seek
a bigger role in the Indo-Pacific, **[[the U.S. needs]{.mark} to engage
them in [more frank discussions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [about these
types of scenarios]{.underline}, [**[creating clearer
expectations]{.underline}** [about how]{.underline}]{.mark} different
[[parties might **respond** **before**]{.mark}]{.underline} any such
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} appears on the horizon, **[[rather than
after]{.mark} one has erupted]{.underline}**.

Beyond the question of NATO's role in Asia, there are also tradeoffs
associated with European partners seeking a more prominent role in the
Indo-Pacific. Encouraging more regular European military deployments to
the Indo-Pacific, while they would be welcomed in Asia, could detract
from NATO's focus on Eastern Europe to deter Russian aggression or in
the Middle East to engage in counterterrorism missions. These are areas
where Europeans will need to shoulder more of the burden in the coming
years as the U.S. continues to rebalance its foreign policy to Asia.

Do the United States and its allies have the right operational
capabilities to address a new type of threat?

Whereas NATO has always aspired to multilateral operational
effectiveness, America's Asian alliances lack NATO-like structures to
generate closer interoperability, particularly in a multilateral
context. Despite the closeness of the U.S.-Japan alliance --- a
relationship that officials refer to as the "cornerstone" of Asian
security, the relationship lacks the integrated command and control
structures that NATO enjoys. In fact, the U.S.-South Korea alliance is
the only one of America's Asian treaty alliances that has such
a mechanism. Beyond command and control, America's Indo-Pacific
alliances in some cases lack the types of integrated planning mechanisms
that NATO has in place, constraining the ability of allies to better
align doctrine and force structure with the United States.

These challenges stretch across the operational realm. NATO's
intelligence directorate and fusion center facilitates real-time
information sharing among the 30 member states. Indo-Pacific countries
have struggled to build similar multilateral information-sharing
capabilities even at the unclassified level. Meanwhile, key Indo-Pacific
allies such as Japan and South Korea remain outside of arrangements such
as the Five Eyes, through which the U.S. shares its most sensitive
intelligence with close allies. And while the U.S. and its Indo-Pacific
allies engage in frequent bilateral exercises with each other, they are
only just beginning to experiment with the types of realistic,
multinational training exercises that will be needed to deal with
Chinese military aggression.

In addition to enhancing their operational effectiveness, the U.S. and
its allies are contending with the question of how to tackle **[[Chinese
security threats]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[are]{.mark}
often]{.underline}** [unconventional and
**[non-kinetic]{.mark}**]{.underline} in nature. As Tom Wright has
eloquently argued, [[China is more focused on]{.mark} competing with
"**[all measures short of war]{.mark}**]{.underline}["
[than]{.underline}]{.mark} [it is on initiating [a]{.mark} major
[conventional conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This reality will **force
U.S. alliances to adapt**]{.underline} [to a new set of requirements
that stretch far beyond]{.underline} the task of [conventional military
deterrence for which these relationships were designed]{.underline}. In
Asia, **[[the U.S. and its allies are wrestling]{.underline}]{.mark}**
with how best to address maritime aggression that involves not only the
People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), but also a vast armed fishing
fleet that operates under military control. In the economic realm, they
are struggling to devise coordinated responses that will deter, or at
least blunt the impact of, China's use of boycotts and embargos to
achieve its security aims. And [in]{.underline} outer space and
**[cyberspace]{.underline}**, U.S. [[alliances will have to
devise]{.mark} **coordinated [responses]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to
contend with]{.mark} Chinese]{.underline} offensive [[capabilities that
could]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~blind~~
\[**[[block]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] **[U.S.
[satellites]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~cripple~~
\[**[[damage]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] banking systems and **[power
[grids]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Addressing these problems will require
new]{.underline} types of combined **[planning]{.underline}**, new
bureaucratic structures, and a more expansive operational toolkit.

**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, too, [[will need **to
adapt**]{.underline} [to address]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the]{.underline}
**[[non-kinetic]{.underline}]{.mark}** [nature of]{.underline}
**[China's]{.underline}** [security]{.underline}
**[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To serve effectively as a forum for
a trans-Atlantic response, NATO needs to more fully consider the impact
of China's investments in Europe on alliance interoperability.
Technological lags among European allies over the past three decades
have decreased their abilities to work seamlessly with the U.S. in a
military operation, and Chinese investments in Europe
could exacerbate the problem by putting the security of
telecommunications infrastructure at risk.

#### Eliminating unsustainable and unenforceable alliance commitments doesn't signal unreliability

Brad L. **LeVeck and** Neil **Narang 16**, associate professor of
political science at the University of California Merced, associate
professor in the Department of Political Science and director of the
Security Hub at the University of California Santa Barbara 2016, How
International Reputation Matters: Revisiting Alliance Violations in
Context,
https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/bleveck/assets/pdfs/how_international_reputation_matters.pdf

In this context, a particularly good indicator of future alliance
behavior may be past behavior. If a state violated its agreements in the
past, it seems intuitive that it may be more likely to do so in the
future. [However]{.underline}, Spence (1973) famously showed that [[past
behavior is not always]{.mark} equally [informative]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that whether [past behavior]{.underline}
distinguishes one type from another **[[depends]{.underline}]{.mark}**
crucially [**[on the behavior's cost]{.underline}**.
**[If]{.underline}**]{.mark}, for instance, **[[honoring an alliance
becomes]{.mark} so [difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}
all **[states are forced to violate their commitments]{.underline}**
together, **[[then a violation conveys little information about how
reliable one state is]{.underline}]{.mark}** relative to another. Beyond
this extreme example, [the general insight is that [alliance
violations]{.mark}]{.underline} do more to [[signal that a state
is]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively [[unreliable
when]{.underline}]{.mark} many **[other [states appear to
be]{.mark}]{.underline}** willing and **[[able to honor the same
agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Of course, whether other states would
honor a particular agreement under similar conditions is often difficult
to observe (Narang 2014; Narang and Mehta 2015), as each alliance has
elements that are somewhat unique. However, there may be times and
regions where system-level shocks cause a large number of countries to
simultaneously violate alliance commitments together. This may provide
relatively clear evidence to a potential partner that the costs of
honoring a previous alliance were so great that even reliable states
that would normally honor their commitment were unable to do so.
[This]{.underline} discussion [has important implications
for]{.underline} empirically [studying how violating an alliance affects
a state's reputation]{.underline}. It is likely that the cost of
maintaining an alliance varies significantly by region and time and that
one can identify shocks across these dimensions. Figure 1, which plots
the percentage of states violating their bilateral security alliance in
each region and year based on Leeds et al. (2009), supports this
supposition.

#### No spillover

[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[argue]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} although Article V does not legally obligate
the United States to deploy military forces in defense of its NATO
allies, such a response would be essential to preserve American
credibility. In other words, [[if the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[failed to defend]{.underline}]{.mark}
its [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} allies against Russian aggression,
[[all]{.mark} of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tate[s' [other
allies]{.mark}]{.underline} around the globe
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} begin to **[[doubt whether they
could]{.underline}]{.mark}** really **[[depend upon the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.
[[Yet]{.mark} U.S. **[credibility would only suffer if Washington were
to maintain an expectation of]{.mark}**]{.underline} U.S.
[[**intervention** and]{.mark} **subsequently [failed to fulfill
that]{.mark} expectation**]{.underline}.

[If the]{.underline} incoming [[Trump]{.mark} administration is serious
about **reducing its commitment to NATO**, its first priority
[should]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [[be to **eliminate** the
**expectation** that the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[would **automatically intervene**
]{.mark}**militarily** [in defense of]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} allies. For **[that expectation is the root
of the inequitable distribution of the defense burden]{.underline}**
within NATO. [Why should]{.underline} the [Europe]{.underline}an allies
[invest significantly]{.underline} in defense [if they can count on the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates to guarantee their security?
[Rather than maintaining an **implicit commitment** to spearhead any
defense of NATO]{.underline} territory (particularly in Eastern Europe),
the [Trump]{.underline} administration [could make it clear]{.underline}
to the allies [that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will
serve as a **balancer of last resort**]{.underline} in Europe. In other
words, the [Europe]{.underline}an allies [will bear primary
responsibility for]{.underline} the [defense]{.underline} of Europe;
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will only intervene in

### Assurance DA\-\--AT: Baltics

#### Deterrence fails in the inevitable hybrid crisis in the Baltics

Illimar **Ploom 18**, Estonian National Defence College, and Viljar
Veebel Baltic Defence College, Nov. 2018, The Deterrence Credibility of
NATO and the Readiness of the Baltic States to Employ the Deterrence
Instruments, Lithuanian Annual Strategic Review, Vol. 16, Is. 1 p.
195-198

The preceding analysis demonstrates **[the weaknesses of the Alliance's
deterrence]{.underline}** strategy. The overall idea of nuclear
capabilities as a supreme guarantee of NATO's credible deterrence does
not help to scale down Russia's regional ambitions. This is due to both
morality arguments as well as practical reasons, such as territorial
proximity of Russia and the Baltic counties, difference in opinions and
priorities within the Alliance, potential for the escalation of conflict
aspects, etc. Russia is justifiably considered to have conventional
supremacy in the Baltic region. The conventional balance in the Baltic
area is not achievable either for the Baltic countries in total nor with
the FPF battalions, and [the [defense models of the Baltic]{.mark}
countries are]{.underline}, by their nature, fully
[nonaggressive]{.underline}, **[[without]{.underline}]{.mark}** any
**[[room for]{.underline}]{.mark}** pre-emptive initiatives, extra
territoriality, or **[[hybrid tools]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What is
more, a[s far as the Baltic countries are concerned,]{.underline} some
[signs of "self-deterrence" are]{.underline} also [visible]{.underline},
referring to unsubstantiated, if not somewhat naïve, views of the
political and military elite of the Baltic countries, as well as relying
on so-called deterrence by imagination. [[The credibility of deterrence
is at risk]{.underline}]{.mark}, depending on different visions of the
Alliance's member states about what should be the values, the focus and
the threat perceptions of the organisation, whether Russia should be
treated as a potential adversary, or a somewhat vague response of the
Alliance to Russia's political rhetoric. Similarly, the ethnic component
-- a relatively big Russian-speaking community, particularly in Estonia
and Latvia -- speaks mostly in favour of Russia in a potential regional
conflict. It must be acknowledged that this could, to some extent, also
have a deterring effect. Last but not least, as [Russia is not suffering
from a feeling of stigmatisation and reciprocity]{.underline}, the
Alliance lacks tools that would have an entangling or disciplining
effect. To answer the question of what should be done in the future to
actually deter Russia and to avoid aggression from the Russian side, the
essence of the potential conflict should first be discussed. It is
argued by this paper that **[[the more precise the aim
against]{.underline}]{.mark}** whom, **[[what, and
when]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[deterrence is needed, the more
cost-efficient]{.mark} the [deterrence is]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Russia's past strategy against the Baltic countries can be judged as
having been definitely well-thought]{.underline}, [covering
most]{.underline} of the [escape routes]{.underline} for potential
"victims". First, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has used the approach
based on the Gerasimov doctrine which [[attempts to find a
**hybrid**]{.mark} **conflict [model]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with a
**very low-intensity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Among other things,
**[[that would devalue the Alliance's credibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and allow an increase in Russia's negative "bargaining
power"]{.underline} in the international arena [by occupying part of the
opponent's territory]{.underline}. Since [[the costs]{.mark} of this
type of confrontation [are low]{.mark}]{.underline},
[**[Russia's]{.mark}** destabilising **[attempts will]{.mark}** most
probably **[continue]{.mark}**]{.underline}, i.e., at least as long as
NATO will decide not to "punish" Russia. Second, [Russia is]{.underline}
simultaneously [determined to respond to any regional initiatives of the
Alliance]{.underline} with its own respective activities and
interventions [which have]{.underline} already [led to a regional arms
race]{.underline}. The reason why something like this has happened is
the fact that [[Russia is]{.mark} strongly [prioritizing national and
emotional categories]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[whereas]{.underline} **[the
current]{.underline}**]{.mark} [overall **[costs for the Alliance are
low]{.mark} enough,**]{.underline} giving no reason to worry yet. Also,
[even if the West contradicts the logic of the sphere of
interests]{.underline}, **[the Baltic states]{.underline}**, being
situated in such proximity to Russia, **[are]{.underline}** de facto
**[considered as a zone where Russia]{.underline}** [needs to be allowed
to]{.underline} **[retain high conventional advantage]{.underline}**.
Thus, [any]{.underline} additional [conventional defence]{.underline}
measure applied on the Eastern flank of NATO [could trigger an
out-of-proportion arms-race or escalation from Russia]{.underline}.
[[This dynamic **is bound to work in Russia's
favour**]{.underline}]{.mark}, also in terms of providing ever more
justification for its worries and possibly a pre-emptive attack. Based
on the past experience of Georgia and Ukraine, as well as Russia's past
strategy against the Baltic countries, one hypothetical scenario why,
when, and how would Russia attack the Baltic countries could be
constructed. The most likely political aim of the potential aggression
against the Baltic countries would be to restore control over the
territory of the former Soviet Union, or at least to break off their
relations with the Western countries. According to this logic,
**[most]{.underline}** of the [**[energy will be invested into]{.mark}**
delegitimizing]{.underline} of local national [political authorities by
using]{.underline} the tools of **[[hybrid
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Ultimately, **[[this would lead to a
situation where]{.underline}]{.mark}**, disappointedly,
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** forces of the **[[Alliance will]{.mark}
decide [to leave the Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [[Russia's
aim]{.mark}]{.underline} during such a takeover in the Baltic region
[would most likely be to maintain as many physical assets and
legitimization as possible. This means it [will]{.mark} need to [avoid
aggressive military activities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Also, since the
[Russian-speaking communities]{.underline} in Estonia and Latvia [are
relatively large]{.underline}, [the takeover will]{.underline} have to
[take place without destroying much]{.underline} of the [local
infrastructure]{.underline}. However, the initiation of protests of
"local women and children" against the "imperialists", including NATO,
is highly likely. This draws on Russia's previous strategies used in
Ukraine in 2014 and in Estonia in 2007. With a "little help" from
Russia, this should not be too difficult, considering the public opinion
of the local Russian-speaking community, at least in Estonia and Latvia.
And, by the same token, the falling out of the Russian-speaking
population will be exacerbated by the suspicious attitude towards the
latter still prevalent among the Estonian and Latvian speaking
communities. Here, the most effective deterrence key would be building a
coherent and mutually respectful society. This presumes dealing
rationally and systematically with the demographic outcomes of the
occupation. Alas, the difficulty is the animosity from the different
ethnic sides in these two countries. Returning to the hypothetical
scenario, in recent years the Kremlin has tried its best to keep up the
ill-feelings among the Baltic people and minorities. Due to the
relatively messy political and social situations, the key element of
Russia's strategy is focussed on the Baltic countries not even being
able to recognise the beginning of the attack. This means that the
latter will omit the opportunity to mobilize, both as far as the Baltic
countries or the Alliance is concerned. [Should the]{.underline} Baltic
countries/[Alliance]{.underline} still decide to [mobilise]{.underline}
themselves, [Russia would describe it as an example of the opponent's
aggressive behaviour]{.underline}, [as well as a justification to
interfere with the aim to]{.underline} [protect the "peaceful local
people".]{.underline}

#### Hybrid threats are the most pressing issue to allies\-\--clarifying Article 5 alleviates abandonment fears

[**[Hybrid threats]{.mark}** and warfare represent one of **[the most

world politics. Seldom noticed and appreciated, [the
**[unravelling]{.mark} of [the international order]{.mark}**
[may]{.mark} slowly [come]{.mark} about [through]{.mark} repeated
[**hybrid blows** to **US**]{.mark} military **[cred]{.mark}**ibility
a[nd its **alliance system**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [the
unconventional nature of coercion, and the **[confusion]{.mark}** and
ambiguity central to hybrid warfare have [kindled **fears of
abandonment**]{.mark} by security partners. Because such operations fall
short of a direct and conventional "armed attack" by one state against
another, the stipulated condition for self-defence and retaliation,
**[allies]{.mark}** may **[fear]{.mark}** that in such circumstances
security **[commitments will not be upheld.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Japan, for instance, was uncomfortable with the Obama administration's
weak-kneed response to China's steady encroachment in the South and East
China Seas, which began with China's seizure of the Scarborough Shoal in
2012. In 2015, Abe eventually secured a redefinition of the guidelines
governing the US-Japan security alliance to deter China in so-called
"grey zone" scenarios also through intelligence sharing, deeper
coordination and bilateral planning.\[7\] Somewhat [similar dynamics and
reassurances have been at play among NATO partners following Russia's
encroachment in Ukraine, but fears of abandonment persist.]{.underline}

[[Concerns of]{.mark} potential [entrapments]{.mark}, or slippery slopes
towards a full-blown military entanglement due to US security
commitments, combined with the very nature of hybrid/grey-zone
scenarios, is likely to **[cloud US decision-making]{.mark}** in such
instances. This will potentially **[slow retaliatory measures]{.mark}**
and circumstantial political factors will have more weight than ever on
such decisions. For these reasons, [Russian]{.mark}]{.underline} and
Chinese [[activities are]{.mark} currently [at the **centre of NATO

#### 'Cred' theory is nonsense.

Hopkins University, BA from William & Mary, International Reporter and

Credibility Trap", Vox, 4/29/2016,
https://www.vox.com/2016/4/29/11431808/credibility-foreign-policy-war

If you have experienced even a few minutes of cable news coverage or
handful of newspaper op-eds on American foreign policy, [there is a
word]{.underline} [you will have encountered over and over again:
**credibility**]{.underline}.

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, according to this
theory, [has to]{.underline} follow through on every threat and
[confront every adversary]{.underline} in order [to maintain America\'s
global credibility. [If it fails]{.mark} to stand up to challengers [in
**one place**]{.mark}, then they will rise up **everywhere**, and
America will see its **[global standing]{.mark}**, and thus its power in
the world, [crumble]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This argument has dominated Washington especially in the three years
since President Barack Obama declined to bomb Syrian leader Bashar
al-Assad as punishment for using chemical weapons. Proponents of
\"credibility\" say this matters for more than just Syria.

American [[allies]{.mark} came to **distrust** and **[drift]{.mark}
away**]{.underline} from US leadership, they argued. And American
adversaries grew emboldened --- including Russia\'s Vladimir Putin,
whose subsequent invasion of Ukraine was said to be a direct result of
weakened American credibility.

\"Putin believes Obama does not have the intestinal fortitude to stand
up to him in Ukraine. He thinks Obama will talk tough and then look for
a way out --- just like he did with Assad,\" wrote Washington Post
columnist Marc Thiessen.

\"Syria has become the graveyard of U.S. credibility,\" columnist
Michael Gerson wrote in the same paper.

This theory is not exclusive to overheated op-eds. It is pervasive,
almost to the point of consensus, in much of Washington\'s foreign
policy community, including among many policy-makers --- and has been
that way longer than perhaps even proponents realize.

In 1950, as the United States considered whether or not to intervene in
the Korean War, a CIA report urged the US to intervene so as to uphold
its credibility far away in Europe:

A failure to draw the line would have seriously discredited the whole US
policy of containment, gravely handicapping US efforts to maintain
alliances and build political influence with the Western European powers
and with other nations closely aligned with the US.

Secretary of State Dean Acheson agreed, fearing that European leaders
would be in a \"near-panic, as they watched to see whether the United
States would act.\" If the US did not invade Korea, Acheson worried,
Europe\'s frail post-war order could be at risk.

And this is not just an American belief. As former National Security
Council official Philip Gordon recounted recently, France kept fighting
in Algeria, long after the costly war appeared lost, partly out of fear
of losing credibility.

\"The credibility issue---if you pull out of Algeria, boy, you lose
face, right? And so the argument was, stay in and keep a lid on it,\"
Gordon told the Atlantic\'s Jeffrey Goldberg.

But [[there is a **problem** with this theory]{.mark} of credibility:
**It does [not]{.mark} appear to be [real]{.mark}**[. **Political
scientists**]{.mark} have **[investigated]{.mark}** this theory [**over
and over**, and]{.mark} have **[repeatedly disprove]{.mark}**n
[it]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Yet the belief in credibility persists, dominating America\'s foreign
policy debate, steering the United States toward military action abroad
in pursuit of a strategic asset --- the credibility of America\'s
reputation --- that turns out not to exist.

How did this idea become so entrenched in Washington, and [why does it
persist despite being **repeatedly debunked**?]{.underline} What does it
mean to have so many of America\'s foreign policy discussions turn
around an idea that is demonstrably false --- and what can this tell us
about how and why America intervenes abroad?

The credibility myth

When Americans talk about \"credibility\" in foreign policy, what they
are usually describing is something that political scientists instead
call reputational or reputation-based credibility.

In political science, \"credibility\" usually refers to specific
promises or threats, and in this case the research does say that
credibility is real. For example, if the US pledges to defend South
Korea from a North Korean invasion, then it matters that the US convince
both Koreas that this pledge is credible, for example by stationing US
troops in South Korea.

\"REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS CAN DRIVE STATES INTO WARS OVER TRIVIAL
INTERESTS IN PERIPHERAL PLACES\"

That is the formal definition of credibility in foreign policy, it\'s
real, and it matters. But when \"credibility\" is used colloquially, it
typically refers to a very different kind of credibility, one based
entirely in a country\'s or leader\'s reputation from its actions in
other disputes or conflicts. (This article uses the colloquial
definition of credibility, except where noted otherwise.)

Under this line of thinking, if the US fails to follow through on a
threat or stand up to a challenger in one part of the world, then its
allies and enemies globally will be more likely to conclude that all
American threats are empty, and that America can be pushed around. If
the US backed down once, it will back down again.

It\'s easy to see how people could be attracted to [this
idea]{.underline}, which [puts complicated geo-politics in
**simple**]{.underline} and familiar **[human terms]{.underline}**. It
encourages us to think of states as just like people.

But [[states are **not people**]{.mark}, and this theory, for all its
appealing **simplicity**, is **not correct**. [There is **no
ev**]{.mark}idence that America\'s [allies]{.mark}]{.underline} or
enemies [[change]{.mark} their [behavior based on]{.mark} conclusions
about America\'s **[reputation]{.mark}** for credibility, or that such a
form of reputation **even exists** in foreign policy]{.underline}.

[\"Do leaders assume that other leaders who have been irresolute in the
past will be irresolute in the future and that, therefore, their threats
are not credible?\"]{.underline} the University of Washington\'s
Jonathan Mercer wrote, in introducing his research on this question.

[\"**No**; **[broad]{.mark} and [deep ev]{.mark}idence
[dispels]{.mark}** that notion,\"]{.underline} Mercer concluded. [\"As
[the **record shows**, **rep**]{.mark}**utation[s do not
matter]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline}

[A]{.underline} 1984 Yale University [study]{.underline}, for example,
[examined **dozens of cases**]{.underline} from 1900 to 1980 to look for
signs that, if a country stood down in one confrontation, it would face
more challengers elsewhere. [The answer was **no**:
\"deterrence]{.underline} success [is not systematically associated ...
with]{.underline} the defender\'s firmness or lack of it in [previous
crises]{.underline}.\"

**[Historians]{.underline}** have also [looked at specific
incidents]{.underline} where the US thought its credibility was on the
line [and determined that we were simply **mistaken**]{.underline}.

Acheson\'s warning that the US had to invade Korea to reassure its
European allies, for example, turned out to be wrong: British and French
officials in fact worried the Americans were going to pull them into a
far-away war.

During the Vietnam War, American officials could see that they were
losing, but for years worried that withdrawing would communicate
weakness to the Soviet Union, emboldening Moscow to test American
commitments elsewhere. Even if Vietnam was lost, American credibility
had to be defended.

As historian Ted Hopf has shown, the Americans could not have had it
more wrong: Soviet leaders never reached any such conclusion, and in
fact were puzzled as to why the US sacrificed so many lives for a war
that was clearly lost.

If that\'s not enough evidence for you, try considering reputational
credibility from the opposite point of view, and it starts to look more
obviously ridiculous. Dartmouth\'s Daryl Press once pointed out to my
colleague Dylan Matthews that Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev
repeatedly threatened to eject the American-led forces occupying West
Berlin, but he backed down. The US didn\'t consider him one iota less
\"credible\" for this, and during the following year\'s Cuban Missile
Crisis took his threats very seriously.

The idea of reputational credibility has also been debunked in the most
well-known recent case: the notion that America\'s failure to bomb Syria
in 2013 emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Proponents of reputational credibility took Putin\'s 2014 Ukraine
invasions as vindication. Surely Putin only invaded because America had
damaged its credibility in Syria, they argued. In their view, it showed
why it is so crucial for the US to maintain its reputational credibility
by never backing down from military interventions.

Julia Ioffe recently investigated this theory for the Atlantic, asking
foreign policy officials and experts in Moscow whether there was merit
to it. She seemed to reach the same conclusion as have many Russia
analysts: that Putin invaded Ukraine for reasons specific to Ukraine.
America\'s supposed reputation loss in Syria appeared to play no role.
Some of Ioffe\'s sources seemed to not even understand the argument of
how Syria and Ukraine would connect.

The credibility trap

You will notice something these incidents have in common. In every case,
a belief in \"credibility\" pulls the United States toward fighting a
war for the wrong reasons, or toward staying in a war longer than is
worthwhile.

This mistaken belief has repeatedly helped to drive American military
action abroad, Dartmouth\'s Jennifer Lind demonstrates in a new article
in International Security Studies Forum.

\"Indeed, from Korea, to Vietnam, to Bosnia, to Libya, to President
Barack Obama's \'red line' in Syria, debates about U.S. intervention are
thick with admonitions that 'Our Credibility Is On The Line,\'\" Lind
writes.

\"CREDIBILITY HAS MIGRATED FROM FOREIGN POLICY INTO THE CONSTITUTIONAL
LAW OF WAR POWERS\"

The logic of reputational credibility can only ever lead to the same
conclusion: toward the use of American military force abroad, even in
cases where there is no clear reason to intervene and where the
downsides of intervention would seem to outweigh the upsides. It is a
compass that only points in one direction.

In this theory, the use of force is inherently good, regardless of how
or where the bombs fall, because it strengthens American leadership
globally. And an absence of American military action is almost always
bad, because it is said to invite new problems and greater threats.

\"Every time analysts and leaders call for war, they warn that inaction
will jeopardize America's credibility,\" Lind and Press, her husband,
have previously written in Foreign Policy.

Alarmingly, despite the mounting evidence against reputation theory, it
continues to drive US foreign policy discourse --- and has recently even
been integrated into the formal legal basis of American foreign policy.

\"Credibility has migrated from foreign policy into the constitutional
law of war powers,\" Vanderbilt\'s Ganesh Sitaraman found in a 2014
Harvard Law Review article:

In a series of opinions, including on Somalia (1992), Haiti (2004), and
Libya (2011), the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has
argued that the credibility of the United Nations Security Council is a
\"national interest\" that can justify presidential authority to use
military force without prior congressional authorization.

The 2011 case is particularly striking, given that it occurred under
President Obama, who has personally denounced reputational credibility
as \"so easily disposed of that I'm always puzzled by how people make
the argument.\"

Yet reputation theory is so prevalent in American thinking that even a
president who specifically opposes that theory --- and is himself a
constitutional lawyer --- has allowed it to be formally integrating into
his government\'s legal case for war.

Are America\'s allies to blame? Or are we?

If reputational credibility has been so repeatedly debunked, both in
specific instances and as a theory, why does it continue to loom so
large in America\'s foreign policy discourse?

Tufts University\'s Michael Beckley hinted at one possible explanation
in a much-discussed article last year in International Security: Could
it have something to do with America\'s uniquely broad network of
alliances?

Beckley\'s article was actually asking a different question --- whether
those alliances lead the US to war, by allowing allies to \"entangle\"
it in foreign conflict. (Beckley concludes the answer is no; other
scholars have disputed his findings.)

But, in reviewing so-called \"entanglement theory,\" Beckley points out
that reputational credibility, even if it doesn\'t exist in the world,
is something that definitely exists in the minds of foreign leaders and
foreign policy decision-makers.

\"The alliance comes to be perceived as an end in itself, transcending
the more concrete national security interests for which it was initially
conceived,\" political scientist Jack Levy wrote in a well-known 1981
paper (which Beckley cites). Here\'s the key quote:

Political decision makers come to believe that support for one\'s
allies, regardless of its consequences, is essential for their national
prestige, and that the failure to provide support would ultimately
result in their diplomatic isolation in a hostile and threatening world.

So it\'s not that reputation is a real thing that compels states to act
in a certain way, but rather that individual decision-makers are driven
by their own mistaken belief in reputation. As a result, Beckley writes,
\"reputational concerns can drive states into wars over trivial
interests in peripheral places.\"

Some scholars, including Levy, argue that America\'s allies promote the
idea of reputation, as a means to convince the United States to commit
more resources to serve their own interests.

Foreign leaders do seem to become awfully preoccupied with American
credibility when they want the US to take military action on their
behalf. When the US failed to bomb Syria in 2013, for example, Syria\'s
enemies in the region --- Arab leaders who are also allied with the US
--- declared that American credibility was at stake.

\"I think I believe in American power more than Obama does,\" Jordan\'s
King Abdullah II said of Obama\'s decision to not bomb Syria.

This comes at a time when the US has grown unusually indulgent of its
allies, as Jeremy Shapiro and Richard Sokolsky argue in a recent
article. This has made American policymakers more likely to heed
allies\' demands and take their claims at face value.

\"THE CREDIBILITY ARGUMENT IS SIMPLY AN EASY (AND HARD TO DISPROVE) WAY
FOR ELITES TO SELL THE FOREIGN POLICY THEY\'RE MOST INTERESTED IN TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE\"

But Dartmouth\'s Jennifer Lind finds evidence that allies make this
argument only opportunistically, and almost always about conflicts in
which they are directly involved. They might speak in the language of
reputation theory, but their behavior suggests that they do not really
believe in it.

Reputation theory, after all, says that America\'s allies would want the
US to intervene as much as possible in other conflicts, when in fact the
opposite is usually true.

In fact, so-called [**[rep]{.mark}**utation [is actually]{.mark} driven
**almost [entirely]{.mark}** by **[internal]{.mark}** American dynamics.
Consider **[America\'s belief]{.mark}** that [it had to intervene in
**Korea** to reassure]{.mark} European [allies, who]{.mark} in fact
[wanted **no**]{.mark} **such [thing]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Lind makes this point well by citing America\'s pledge to defend Taiwan
from a possible Chinese invasion. According to reputation theory, Asian
leaders who also fear Chinese aggression would want the US to make and
uphold this pledge. American policymakers indeed believe this, and it is
one reason (albeit far from the only reason) why the US has pledged to
fight in such a war.

\"[Many]{.underline} U.S. leaders and foreign policy elites [today argue
that, in the event of a war in]{.underline} the [Taiwan]{.underline}
strait, the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [must
defend Taiwan or see its credibility collapse]{.underline},\" Lind
writes.

[[In reality]{.mark}, the **[opposite]{.mark} is true**. American
[allies]{.mark} in Asia]{.underline}, Lind writes, \"[[make it
**clear**]{.mark} that [they under **no circumstances** want]{.mark}
[war]{.mark} in the Taiwan strait, and fear that the Americans will
someday fight one with China.\"]{.underline}

The Taiwan example is instructive, if alarming: America\'s foreign
policy community believes something that is flatly untrue. And while a
Sino-American war over Taiwan is extremely unlikely, it looked
substantially less unlikely in the 1990s. It is concerning that American
policymakers were committing the US to fight such a war in part because
they believed something that was 180-degrees the opposite of reality.

The point is not just that America\'s mistaken belief in credibility is
dangerous, but also that [it [does **not** come from **allies**. It
comes from **us**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### No link\-\--alliance cred doesn't spill over broadly because states view reliability through [their stakes and interests]{.underline} in each issue 

Iain D. **Henry 20**, Lecturer at the Strategic and Defence Studies
Centre, Australian National University, Spring 2020, "What Allies Want:
Reconsidering Loyalty, Reliability, and Alliance Interdependence,"
International Security, Vol. 44, No. 4, p. 45-83

Third, the reliability idea allows for alliance commitments to be
interdependent, but in a broader sense than usually expected. Mercer
defines interdependence as "using past behavior to predict or explain
future behavior," and interdependence is often examined in terms of
iterative crises: the state backed down in the first crisis, so it is
expected to back down in a second crisis.40 Interdependence could also
operate on a much quicker schedule, however, in nonconflict situations,
and with reference to revelations of interests rather than character.
[If a state observes something indicating allied unreliability, then it
should try to mitigate this risk. A state fearing abandonment could
increase its defense budget]{.underline}, seek new allies, peacefully
settle old scores, [or **discuss these fears with the
ally**]{.underline}. A state fearing entrapment could employ distancing
strategies, threaten to withhold support, launch peace initiatives, or
even abrogate the alliance. [Alternatively, [because the state is not
judging character]{.mark}, interdependence could be weak: [if a state
has **no real stake in an issue**, and its ally's actions will not
affect reliability]{.mark}, then [the state may not care how its ally
behaves]{.mark}]{.underline}.41

Importantly, this concept of interdependence allows for the ally's
actions to be important now, not just in future crises. Considering how
interdependence operates simultaneously across discrete alliance
commitments allows for the idea of reliability to be tested within a
single crisis. Further, it is more representative of the real world: a
state might not need to worry significantly about an adversary's resolve
until the next crisis, but Brett Ashley Leeds finds that when
"conditions change, \[alliance\] violation becomes more likely."42 Thus,
I expect states to be sensitive to variations in their ally's
reliability.

However, [[because reliability is contingent upon interests---not
character judgments]{.mark}---the [**effects of alliance interdependence
might not be as severe** as those predicted]{.mark} by other theories.
[If states do not assess character]{.mark}, then
[an]{.mark}]{.underline} \[End Page 55\] [**[ally's unreliability on one
particular issue will not result in the ally being unreliable on all
matters]{.mark}**. A [U.S.]{.mark} backdown and [withdrawal in one
region **may not damage**]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [[**reliability in
another**: it may]{.mark}, instead, [improve it]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Alternatively, the United States' [unwillingness to support a **reckless
ally** may **mean nothing** for its determination to **defend that same
ally** against an unprovoked attack]{.underline}.
