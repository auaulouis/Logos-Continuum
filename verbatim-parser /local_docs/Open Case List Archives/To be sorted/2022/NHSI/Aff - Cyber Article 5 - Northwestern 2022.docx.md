[Russia's state-supported cyberattacks **increased**]{.underline} both
before and [during its invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. The moves are
[part of Moscow's]{.underline} **[broader attempt]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[disrupt services]{.underline}** [and
create]{.underline} **[intimidation]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
[**confusion**. Up until now]{.underline}, however, [the Kremlin
has]{.underline} **[not launched]{.underline}** a **[devastating
cyberwar]{.underline}** [against]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}**
countries, [despite]{.underline} **[numerous warnings]{.underline}** in
recent months.

[Western experts are]{.underline} **[still uncertain]{.underline}**
[whether fears of American cyber retaliation and the existence of
a]{.underline} "Mutual Assured Cyber Destruction"
("**[cyber-MAD]{.underline}**") [are the reason why such attacks have
not materialized. But]{.underline} any **[further Western
sanctions]{.underline}** (such as the European Union's declared oil
embargo on Russia) [will]{.underline} **[increase the
risk]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[devastating]{.underline}**
Russian **[cyberattacks]{.underline}**.

Shared targets

On May 10, 2022, the European Union, United Kingdom and the United
States officially attributed a February 24 cyberattack to Russia. One
hour before the invasion of Ukraine, hackers had targeted the
Viasat-operated KA-SAT satellite network to disrupt command and control
of the Ukrainian military and government communications.

The disrupted internet access caused collateral damage to commercial and
residential internet services. Thousands of modems across Central Europe
lost their satellite connection. In Germany, 5,800 Enercon wind turbines
could no longer be remotely monitored by their operators.

Since the invasion, [Russian attacks have become]{.underline} **[more
frequent]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[destructive]{.underline}**.
They are **[coordinated]{.underline}** [with the Kremlin's]{.underline}
**[military]{.underline}** [actions as part of]{.underline} its
**[hybrid warfare]{.underline}** against both Ukraine and the West.
[Its]{.underline} **[state-supported hacker groups]{.underline}** [began
preparing]{.underline} for the conflict [as early as]{.underline}
**[March 2021]{.underline}**, according to new reports on Russia's
relentless cyberattacks as part of its hybrid warfare against Ukraine.
These cyber operations require careful planning, targeting and
development, which requires months if not years.

In recent years, both the U.S. and EU have intensified their
collaboration with Ukraine on cybersecurity. This is because Ukraine has
become a testing ground for Russia's advanced cyberattacks on critical
infrastructure, and the West can learn much from Russian cyber strikes
against Ukraine.

In 2015, Russia conducted its first deliberate cyberattack on Ukraine's
energy infrastructure and grid system. In 2017, the Kremlin-backed
NotPetya virus, designed to disrupt financial, energy and government
sectors in Ukraine, spread internationally and cost companies around the
world over \$10 billion in damages.

For the EU, strengthening the cybersecurity of Ukraine's critical
infrastructure has become increasingly important since the Ukrainian
electricity grid is being integrated into the EU's common electricity
market and network (ENTSO-E).

The rising vulnerabilities of Western societies and economies have been
highlighted in 2020 after the hack of a leading U.S. security tech
company and its software (SolarWinds). It gave the Russian hacker group
"Cozy Bear" (also called "Nobelium" or APT-29) access to thousands of
companies' data, as well as critical infrastructure in various
countries. The targets of this hacker group are believed to reflect the
Kremlin's geopolitical interests and strategic priorities. Cozy Bear has
increased its attacks against Ukraine from a mere six in 2021 to more
than 1,200 this year, with particular focus on the Ukrainian government
and its state agencies.

There are also lessons to be learned from the ransomware cyberattack on
the 8,000-kilometer U.S. Colonial oil pipeline. In May 2021, hackers
infiltrated the company's information technology infrastructure and were
able to disable the pipeline's operation. The hack affected the oil
supply for both private consumers and U.S. Armed Forces, leading to
panic buying. The attackers stole nearly 100 gigabits of data and
requested a ransom of 75 Bitcoin (\$4.4 million at the time) to return
access to the company's billing system. The company eventually paid the
ransom to the cyber hacker group DarkSide, despite the government's
efforts to prevent this. In response, the Biden administration passed
the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act (SACA) last March. It
requires federal agencies as well as owners and operators of critical
infrastructure to report cyberattacks within 72 hours and ransomware
payments within 24 hours. But how to better mitigate threats and enhance
resilience collectively across industries and sectors is not addressed
in the SACA.

Mutual escalation

Since the war in Ukraine began, [Russia's state-backed cyberattacks
against Western **critical infrastructure** have
**increased**]{.underline} -- [by]{.underline} as much as **[72
percent]{.underline}** in the U.K. Alongside ever more Western sanctions
and the increasing supply of heavy weaponry, NATO countries fear that
[Russia could]{.underline} **[escalate]{.underline}** [its nascent
cyberwar with **sophisticated strikes**]{.underline} [against critical
infrastructure]{.underline}. NATO governments and the European Central
Bank have repeatedly warned that the West should be prepared for this
eventuality.

The Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network among the U.S., the UK,
Canada, Australia and New Zealand stated in April that Russia was
planning massive cyberattacks against Western countries supporting
Ukraine. A dozen hacking groups were designated as threats, since they
are part of, or close to, Russian intelligence and military
institutions. They have the ability to anonymously compromise IT
networks, steal large amounts of data, deploy destructive malware and
bring down networks.

Last October, Microsoft warned in its 2021 Digital Defense Report that
Russia was the state that posed the greatest cyber threat. Russian
hackers are considered much more prolific than those from China, Iran
and North Korea. In 2020, 58 percent of all state-backed cyberattacks
identified by Microsoft came from Russia. Cozy Bear accounted for more
than 92 percent of all detected Russian activity. Microsoft also warned
that its attacks targeting enterprise VPN software have become up to 32
percent more successful. Attacks are mainly carried out as espionage and
intelligence campaigns against government agencies and think tanks. The
top target countries are the U.S., Ukraine, and the UK.

In March, the White House issued a strongly worded warning that [Russia
is]{.underline} **[planning major cyberattacks against the
U.S.]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[retaliation]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} its **[harsh economic sanctions]{.underline}**. In
April, a U.S. federal advisory warned that [hackers with ties to foreign
governments are targeting **specific industrial processes**]{.underline}
[and their]{.underline} **[i]{.underline}**nformation and
**[c]{.underline}**ontrol **[s]{.underline}**ystems, [including
the]{.underline} **[s]{.underline}**upervisory **[c]{.underline}**ontrol
**[a]{.underline}**nd **[d]{.underline}**ata
**[a]{.underline}**cquisition [devices to]{.underline} **[disrupt,
sabotage and physically destruct them]{.underline}**.

Last June, U.S. President Joe Biden, embarrassed by the SolarWinds hack
and facing political pressure to retaliate against Russia, issued a
warning to President Vladimir Putin. At the first bilateral
cybersecurity summit since the Kremlin's annexation of Crimea in 2014,
Mr. Biden stated that 16 areas of critical infrastructure, including
energy, health and water, should be "off-limits to attack" by
cyberattacks or other means.

He also urged the Kremlin to take action against criminals conducting
ransomware attacks. But bilateral cybersecurity cooperation has not made
any significant progress since last summer. Illicit ransomware
activities by criminal groups appear to have continued unabated. The
trend goes hand in hand with the booming cryptocurrency industry, which
provides anonymous digital assets that can be used for money laundering.

'Cyber-MAD' and cyber deterrence

[Alongside]{.underline} **[diplomatic]{.underline}** [efforts to
de-escalate cyber tensions]{.underline} between the West and Russia
during the last few years, [Western allies have warned Russia of
"massive]{.underline} [**consequences**" for its largest banks and
trading companies in the case of escalating cyberwarfare]{.underline}
against NATO and EU countries.

[Despite Russia's undeniable]{.underline} offensive cyber
[**capabilities**, the Kremlin has]{.underline} **[not
initiated]{.underline}** any **[larger devastating
cyberwar]{.underline}** against the West since its military invasion
began -- despite unprecedented sanctions.

[**One** explanation could be]{.underline} that both the U.S. and NATO
have stated that a highly damaging cyberattack on any member of the
alliance could trigger **[Article 5]{.underline}** of the treaty, which
guarantees mutual defense. This could indicate that some form of "cyber
MAD" still functions between the U.S. and Russia. Many **[cyber
experts]{.underline}** [have warned that the West]{.underline} **[cannot
afford to bet on that as a deterrent]{.underline}**. However, defining
[a]{.underline} more **[assertive]{.underline}** [cyber retaliation
strategy must]{.underline} also [consider the possibility of
an]{.underline} **[escalatory spiral]{.underline}** [that could even
result in Russia resorting to use]{.underline} **[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**, [even]{.underline} perhaps
**[preemptively]{.underline}**.

During its 2014 annexation of Crimea, Russia learned that [it
is]{.underline} **[much more difficult]{.underline}** [to conduct
a]{.underline} [surgical]{.underline} **[cyber]{.underline}** [strike
than an]{.underline} **[indiscriminate]{.underline}** [one. If the
Kremlin decides to **directly attack**]{.underline} major Western
[**infrastructure**, it will face]{.underline} [**retaliation**. But the
situation could **also** escalate because Russia might
**not**]{.underline} always **[be able to control its own cyber
operations]{.underline}** on selected targets, potentially leading to
unwanted escalation and collateral damages far beyond what was initially
intended.

Since the beginning of the war, Russia itself has become the target of
numerous international pro-Ukraine cyber groups and hackers, shattering
illusions of Moscow's cyber superiority. Cyberattacks on the Russian
government and military institutions have increased significantly. The
active Anonymous group has stolen hundreds of millions of documents from
governmental and industrial websites, including the Ministry of Defense.
Others have blocked or slowed freight trains carrying Russian military
equipment or tampered with the automatic ticket system for passengers.

Ukraine itself has built an "army" of IT volunteers (like Network
Battalion 65) to protect the country against Russian hackers, but also
to launch counter operations against Russian cyber threats. The
Ukrainian cybersecurity company Hacken claims that 10,000 hackers from
150 countries have volunteered to disrupt Russian media sites and
promote pro-Ukrainian messages across Russian social media.

But these international and private Ukrainian hacker groups have acted
without any kind of coordination, in contrast to Russia's
state-supported cyber groups controlled by the foreign intelligence
agency (SVR) or the military intelligence agency (GRU). Hence, the
impact of these international cyberattacks against Russia has yet not
been significant enough to shift the Kremlin's cost-benefit calculation
of its invasion of Ukraine.

Scenarios

[Russia's]{.underline} red lines and **[escalation
strategy]{.underline}** [could]{.underline} further [**change in the
weeks and months ahead**. How the]{.underline} **[military, political
and economic]{.underline}** [aspects]{.underline} [**evolve**,
and]{.underline} **[war aims change]{.underline}** [will]{.underline}
**[influence]{.underline}** how the Kremlin decides to use its **[cyber
capabilities]{.underline}** in the conflict.

[Beyond the]{.underline} **[Russian]{.underline}**-Ukrainian [war,
if]{.underline} [**adversarial threats increase**, so too
will]{.underline} the [**vulnerabilities**, as the world increasingly
relies on digital technology]{.underline}. In 2021, a record-breaking
number of cyberattacks took place -- a 50 percent increase from the
previous year according to the cybersecurity firm Check Point Research.
New **[forecasts]{.underline}** [suggest that 2022 could be **even
worse**. Cyber threats to civilian and military critical infrastructure
are likely to **multiply**]{.underline} [and grow even]{.underline}
**[more consequential]{.underline}** [as the digital and physical worlds
become increasingly intertwined]{.underline}. While
**[awareness]{.underline}** [of the need]{.underline} for cyber
resilience has grown in the West, it [is]{.underline} **[too
little]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[prevent]{.underline}**
[disastrous cyberattacks on critical infrastructure]{.underline}.

#### Russia's [aggressive]{.underline}\-\--they [won't stop at Ukraine]{.underline}. Getting response policy in order in [advance]{.underline} is key. 

Thomas D. **Grant 22**, served as Senior Advisor for Strategic Planning

Must Not Deter the Defense of the Free World," Real Clear Defense,

As Vladimir Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine enters its second
week, the Russian autocrat escalates his threats of nuclear war.
[Some]{.underline} policy [commentators say]{.underline} this means [we
should look for easy "offramps" that Putin can exploit]{.underline} to
save his failing régime. [**They are badly mistaken**. There **are no
offramps**]{.underline} for Putin now, [and trying to **build
them**]{.underline} for him [will only invite far **more dangerous
aggression**]{.underline}.

Putin's invasion has not gone according to plan. No swift victory came
from his opening salvo: murder squads pre-positioned in Kyiv and an
airborne attack on Antonov Airfield did not decapitate the
democratically elected government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A
week later, the supply train for Putin's troops is in shambles, and
Russian army units are reportedly running out of food and fuel. The
Russian air force has not established uncontested control of Ukraine\'s
airspace. As yet unclear is whether Ukraine's Bayraktar drones will
outdo those Azerbaijan employed in 2020 to devastating effect against
Armenia, but they already have had an impact; and Russia is only now
encircling Kharkiv and Kyiv with rocket launchers and their supply
elements, creating a truly target-rich environment for the defenders'
unmanned systems. Most seriously at variance with Putin\'s plan,
Ukraine\'s army and citizens are resisting with ferocity, and nobody has
ousted Ukraine\'s leaders as Putin implored unnamed persons in Kyiv.
Reports that at least some Russian soldiers are refraining from fighting
when they meet Russian-speaking Ukrainians in the east should be as
alarming to Putin as drone strikes, Javelins, or the prospect of a drawn
out war against a nation with a history of partisan resistance second to
none in the world. Meanwhile, with unprecedented speed and strength,
international sanctions are starting to throttle the Russian economy.

Experts on Russia's armed forces note that [Russian military doctrine
calls for **escalation**]{.underline}, at least to the level of tactical
nuclear weapons, [when a conventional operation fails. Putin's
conventional operation in Ukraine **is failing**. Moreover, Putin has
**raved**]{.underline} [that a threat to his régime is a threat to
Russia's very existence, and he says Russia will use strategic nuclear
weapons if confronted with an existential threat. These are
not]{.underline} considerations [to be taken **lightly**. It **would**
be foolish to blunder into escalation if **nothing else were at
stake**]{.underline} [and if an **obvious way out**]{.underline}---an
\"offramp\"---[were readily available. The problem is, the stakes are
enormous, and there **is no offramp for Putin**]{.underline}.

Emboldening the aggressor

[If the West resiles from supporting Ukraine, then Putin will **return
emboldened**]{.underline} [to pursue]{.underline} [**even more audacious
aggression**. This is **not speculative**]{.underline}. [He
has]{.underline} **[rambled]{.underline}** in speeches **[for
years]{.underline}** [about the loss of the]{.underline} **[Russian
Empire]{.underline}**---not just the Soviet Empire but also the Tsarist
one. Indeed, his aesthetic sensibilities and ostentatious embrace of the
Russian Orthodox Church suggest that [Putin takes the]{.underline}
**[pre-1917 Empire]{.underline}** [as his]{.underline} preferred [model.
He makes threats against]{.underline} **[Poland]{.underline}**, the
largest part of which belonged to Russia before 1917, [and
the]{.underline} **[Baltic States]{.underline}**, all of which were in
the Tsar\'s Empire before Stalin forcibly seized them again in 1939 in
collusion with Hitler. **[Kazakhstan]{.underline}** [has also drawn
Putin\'s ire with a substantial Russian-speaking population]{.underline}
like Ukraine but vastly more natural wealth. [The Kremlin leader
dismisses that country too as non-existent and lacking any real
sovereignty]{.underline}. Once a grand duchy of the Tsar\'s,
[even]{.underline} **[Finland]{.underline}** [has not escaped Putin\'s
attention]{.underline}. His government has threatened unspecified
military actions in response to Finland's expression of concern over
Russia's aggression. [Putin's declarations about lost territories and
the grandeur of the Russian past indicate his **real
aims**]{.underline}. [He was **not bluffing about
Ukraine**]{.underline}. [It would be folly to conclude that he is
bluffing about his **further** territorial ambitions. His ambitions will
not disappear if the West finds a way out for him from his current war
of aggression. Nor will his ability to make nuclear
threats.]{.underline}

[Putin's revanchism is **not limited**]{.underline} [to taking territory
from **neighboring countries**]{.underline} whose borders Russia
solemnly and bindingly recognized as settled and final at the end of the
Cold War. [Putin seeks vengeance against a **wide ranging**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} relatively **[abstract]{.underline}** [set of
**institutions** and]{.underline} **[ideas]{.underline}**. Western
**[democracy]{.underline}** [and the **rule of law**]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} the **[key]{.underline}** enemies in Putin\'s
worldview. [The]{.underline} **[E]{.underline}**uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion [and]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}** [are
the **institutional expressions** of those ideas]{.underline}. Perverse
as it sounds, a war aim of Putin\'s in Ukraine might well be to
instigate the largest refugee crisis in Europe since 1945. Some 600,000
people had already fled Ukraine by March 1st. The Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that Russia's war
against Ukraine might result in 4 million refugees. It is a mistake to
assume that this is only a byproduct of Putin's aggression. It could
well be one of Putin's main goals. Refugees in such numbers would place
an enormous strain on the governments of Europe and on the union that
Putin considers to be inimical to his régime. [This]{.underline}
**[atrocity]{.underline}**, too, [and]{.underline} **[more like
it]{.underline}** in the future, [Putin can perpetrate]{.underline}
**[only]{.underline}** [if he]{.underline} **[cows the
West]{.underline}** through threats of nuclear war.

Indeed, his nuclear threats are the only means available to Putin that
could possibly enable him to realize his aims in the face of the
concerted effort that we now see emerging against him. He calculates
that the world will back off, and then he can return when he is ready
and take whatever lands he declares are his and inflict whatever harm on
people and institutions he chooses. The very scope of Putin\'s aims must
lead us to temper the horror and revulsion we naturally feel when Putin
brandishes Russia's nuclear weapons. [Consider what will]{.underline}
**[follow]{.underline}** [if we allow Putin **respite**]{.underline}
[and he wins time to **lick his wounds**. It is inconceivable that he
will **not come back---and soon---for more**. This could
mean]{.underline} **[completing]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
**[destruction of]{.underline}** whatever part of
**[Ukraine]{.underline}** is still intact. [It could also mean---and
almost **inevitably will in
time**]{.underline}---**[escalating]{.underline}** his threats and
moving [against the]{.underline} **[Baltic]{.underline}**
[States,]{.underline} **[Poland]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[others still]{.underline}**. Then there is Putin's role as chief in a
régime of oligarchs, a role that will grow if he is allowed to resume
exploiting international trade and investment for that régime's
kleptocratic purposes. [His subversion of]{.underline} **[western
democracies]{.underline}** [will]{.underline} **[not cease
either]{.underline}**.

[None of these lines of attack are distant hypotheticals. They
are]{.underline} **[underway already]{.underline}** [or are]{.underline}
**[logical extensions]{.underline}** [of what Putin has]{.underline}
**[already done]{.underline}**. The question is whether he will get a
chance to continue his aggression at a future date in future places. If
he does, **[then]{.underline}** [the nuclear risk will be]{.underline}
[**greater, not less**, than it is today because Putin will need the
nuclear threat more, not less, the further his assault on the free world
goes.]{.underline}

#### A full-scale NATO response risks [nuclear escalation]{.underline}

[From its opening]{.underline} moments, the conflict in
[Ukraine]{.underline} has [involved a nuclear
**dimension**]{.underline}. On Feb. 24, Russian President Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} ominously [warned of "consequences you have never
seen" if other countries tried to get involved]{.underline} in Ukraine
--- [an implied nuclear threat]{.underline}. Several days later, Putin
announced that Russia's nuclear forces would be put on a "special combat
readiness" status. More recently, Dmitry Medvedev, a senior Russian
official, warned that if Finland and Sweden join NATO, "there can be no
more talk of any nuclear-free status for the Baltic."

[So far]{.underline}, the [Biden]{.underline} administration [has
attempted to]{.underline} **[dismiss]{.underline}** [Russia's
announcement as]{.underline} [**irresponsible saber-rattling**. But as
Putin]{.underline} **[continues]{.underline}** [issuing nuclear threats,
policymakers are likely to feel growing **pressure to respond**. In
particular, they may be tempted to find ways to **signal to
Russia**]{.underline} to deter the use of nuclear weapons. [One way this
might be done is through]{.underline} **[cyber]{.underline}**
operations. In fact, some cyber experts are already calling for the
United States to consider cyber attacks for signaling purposes. For
example, writing in the Washington Post, Dmitri Alperovitch and Samuel
Charap call on the Biden administration to consider a cyber
"shock-and-awe demonstration" in response to a major Russian cyber
attack against the West. They claim that such a response, which could
include disrupting the Internet throughout Russia, would signal U.S.
resolve and help prevent further escalation that they fear "could result
in nuclear war."

[However]{.underline}, conducting **[cyber operations]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[signal deterrence]{.underline}**
[would]{.underline}, paradoxically, [**increase risks of escalation**.
This]{.underline} risk [is]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** just
**[hypothetical]{.underline}**, especially [in light of Russia's
**updated declaratory policy**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the [first
use of nuclear weapons, which may **include responses to cyber
attacks**. Russia has]{.underline} **[reinforced this]{.underline}**
message [during the war in Ukraine]{.underline}. In early March, a
hacking group affiliated with Anonymous claimed that it had shut down
the control center of Russia's space agency. While denying that the
attack took place, Russia nevertheless warned that a cyber attack
against its satellites would be a justification for war.

The Biden administration should clearly communicate that cyber
operations for nuclear signaling are out of bounds, just as it declared
restraint in other aspects of this conflict, like the deployment of
American troops to Ukraine.

How Cyberspace Is Creating Nuclear Risks

Policymakers and academics are attuned to the cyber risks to nuclear
command and control. [The]{.underline} **[practitioner]{.underline}**
[community has largely focused on]{.underline} **[U.S.
vulnerabilities]{.underline}** and how to mitigate them.
**[Scholars]{.underline}**, in turn, [worry about how cyber operations
could have **unintended** escalatory consequences. But]{.underline} less
attention has been paid to **[another]{.underline}** [likely scenario:
the use of cyber]{.underline} operations [for]{.underline} **[signaling
purposes]{.underline}** ([operations with]{.underline} **[visible
effects]{.underline}** [that aim to **convey a message**]{.underline} to
another state) [in a]{.underline} **[nuclear context]{.underline}**. The
**[ambiguity]{.underline}** [of cyber operations can
**sometimes**]{.underline} [be useful for signaling --- but
the]{.underline} **[same ambiguity]{.underline}** [can be]{.underline}
**[dangerous]{.underline}** [during]{.underline} a [**nuclear crisis**.
The problem is that]{.underline} **[civilian leaders]{.underline}** in
particular, distinct from the military, [are inclined to see cyber
attacks as effective signaling tools]{.underline}.

[Cyber operations could have]{.underline} **[nuclear
implications]{.underline}**, especially [because]{.underline}
**[modern]{.underline}** nuclear **[c]{.underline}**ommand
[and]{.underline} **[c]{.underline}**ontrol **[systems]{.underline}**,
like those in Russia and the United States, are becoming increasingly
**[depend]{.underline}**ent [on digital infrastructure]{.underline}.
Nuclear command, control, and communications systems, which include
early warning, information collection, and communications capabilities,
alert decision-makers to impending nuclear strikes and also enable
leaders to control decisions about nuclear use (or non-use). But
[their]{.underline} **[digital dependencies]{.underline}** [are creating
opportunities for **exploitation using cyber**]{.underline} means. In a
2020 report, the Nuclear Threat Initiative found that "almost 9 out of
10 planned nuclear modernization programs involve at least some new
digital components or upgrades."

**[Vulnerabilities]{.underline}** [inherent in the digital
infrastructure that undergird modern nuclear systems provide
opportunities for actors to engage in cyber]{.underline}
**[espionage]{.underline}** --- gaining access to a network or system to
steal information --- [or even conduct]{.underline} cyber [**attacks**.
Hypothetically, a cyber power like Russia could]{.underline} conduct a
**[cyber attack]{.underline}** against [a]{.underline} **[U.S. early
warning satellite]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[degrade
it]{.underline}**s functionality. [This has become]{.underline} an
**[urgent]{.underline}** concern for practitioners. U.S. Strategic
Command, for instance, is currently working to "operationally harden NC3
systems against cyber threats." Congress has also gotten involved,
requiring the Defense Department to evaluate the cybersecurity of major
weapon systems. And the Government Accountability Office has published
multiple reports decrying the state of cybersecurity and scope of
vulnerabilities of weapon systems, including elements of the nuclear
triad.

From an academic perspective, scholars have investigated how cyber
operations targeting nuclear systems could exacerbate escalation risks.
Focusing on nuclear forces, early research, such as work by Martin
Libicki, was skeptical of the dangers posed by cyber operations. Nuclear
forces were seen as being largely immune from digital attacks because
they were "air gapped," meaning that they were separated from
information technology systems.

[However, as nuclear systems have become increasingly
**intertwined**]{.underline} [with the]{.underline} **[digital
environment]{.underline}** [--- not to mention the]{.underline}
**[dual-use nature]{.underline}** [of many elements of nuclear command,
control, and communications systems]{.underline} (like early warning or
position, navigation, and timing satellites) --- the
[protection]{.underline} offered [by being **segregated from the
internet**]{.underline} [is]{.underline} **[less robust]{.underline}**.
Jacquelyn Schneider, Benjamin Schechter, and Rachael Schaffer, for
instance, ran [a series of]{.underline} **[wargames]{.underline}**
[demonstrating]{.underline} that [decision-makers in]{.underline}
hypothetical [crises are]{.underline} **[likely to use their cyber
exploits]{.underline}** [against an adversary's nuclear
systems]{.underline}. They found that [this could have]{.underline}
[**negative effects on states' respective nuclear strategies**,
especially decisions to]{.underline} **[pre-delegate nuclear launch
authority]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[automate]{.underline}**
nuclear **[responses]{.underline}**. Erik Gartzke and Jon Lindsay argue
that [the]{.underline} **[clandestine nature]{.underline}** [of cyber
operations means that one state could **secretly** gain
access]{.underline} to an adversary's nuclear command, control, and
communications systems, [giving the former an]{.underline}
**[information advantage]{.underline}** [or even creating an incentive
for the latter to]{.underline} **[use]{.underline}** its nuclear
**[weapons]{.underline}** [out of the fear that it]{.underline} **[may
lose them]{.underline}**. James Acton notes that [the difficulties of
distinguishing between cyber]{.underline} **[espionage]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[attack]{.underline}** [could lead a state
to]{.underline} **[misperceive the intent]{.underline}** [behind a cyber
operation, generating a]{.underline} similar **["use it or lose it"
calculus]{.underline}**.

#### It causes [global posture shifts]{.underline} that make [accidental]{.underline} nuclear use far more likely.

The problem is that, [more often than not, cyber operations
are]{.underline} **[ambiguous]{.underline}** signals. [There is evidence
that states can use cyber operations under some (narrow) conditions to
signal a desire to de-escalate international crises. But these findings
**do not extend well to nuclear crises**]{.underline}
[where]{.underline} **[clarity]{.underline}**, rather than uncertainty,
[is important for stability. The use of cyber operations to defuse
crises have involved cyber signaling]{.underline} [**short of war**,
**not**]{.underline} [during an **ongoing**]{.underline} conventional
**[conflict]{.underline}** [involving nuclear powers]{.underline}. And
they have not involved cyber operations targeting a state's nuclear
command and control where states, like Russia, have already staked out
declaratory policies. Moreover, [states are still at a]{.underline}
**[nascent stage]{.underline}** [in developing]{.underline} **[shared
indices]{.underline}** [to inform assessments of intent in cyberspace,
especially when it comes to cyber operations in **nuclear
crises**]{.underline}.

[Therefore, even if Russia would not take the cataclysmic step of
escalating to the]{.underline} **[first use of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** [in response]{.underline} to a U.S. cyber
operation, [it could]{.underline} **[misinterpret U.S. signaling
efforts]{.underline}** [and take measures to make]{.underline}
**[nuclear use easier]{.underline}** ([such as]{.underline} [**making
warheads operational**, **dispersing**]{.underline} forces,
**[pre-delegating]{.underline}** authority, [or increasing]{.underline}
**[automaticity]{.underline}**). [These readiness measures]{.underline}
could [increase the chances of]{.underline}
**[inadvertent]{.underline}** [or even]{.underline} **[accidental
escalation]{.underline}**.

The Biden administration has been commendable in clearly and
consistently communicating to Russia, and other audiences, what the
United States will not do in the Ukraine crisis --- like sending
American forces to Ukraine or establishing a no-fly zone. In addition,
the administration should be equally clear about what is off the table
in cyberspace --- what Jacquelyn Schneider has termed a "strategic
no-first-use" policy in cyberspace. Specifically, the United States
should unequivocally convey to Russia that it will refrain from taking
actions in cyberspace during this crisis that would undermine nuclear
stability, such as conducting disruptive cyber-attacks against early
warning satellites. This is different --- the opposite, in fact --- from
drawing "red lines" in cyberspace, which are meant to deter unwanted
behavior but can often backfire. Instead, the United States should
communicate where it will exhibit restraint in cyber operations --- a
form of confidence-building. This could be conveyed publicly through
statements by administration officials, similar to statements that Biden
has made about other aspects of America's role in Ukraine. It could also
be privately communicated through ongoing backchannels taking place
between U.S. allies, like France, and Russia.

[There are]{.underline} also [policy implications]{.underline}
**[beyond]{.underline}** the **[Ukraine]{.underline}** conflict,
especially in an environment in which the United States confronts
potential future crises with other nuclear powers. In particular, senior
national security officials have repeatedly emphasized that
**[China]{.underline}** [represents a "**pacing challenge**" for
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
[including across the nuclear and cyber realms.]{.underline} In fact,
[Gen. Nakasone recently announced the creation of a China Outcomes Group
under Cyber Command and the NSA]{.underline}. And [researchers have
identified how hypothetical crises involving the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline}
**[China]{.underline}** [could]{.underline} **[escalate]{.underline}**
[along]{.underline} **[dangerous trajectories]{.underline}**, including
[to the use of]{.underline} [**nuclear weapons**. The]{.underline}
**[consequences]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[misunderstanding the
utility of cyber signaling]{.underline}** [in this area are]{.underline}
**[significant]{.underline}**. Therefore, policymakers must consider how
to improve civil-military coordination and cohesion so that the
employment of military cyber power --- especially when used against
sensitive adversary systems, particularly nuclear ones, during delicate
periods --- is not out of sync with strategic objectives.
[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[should]{.underline} also [develop a]{.underline} more [robust effort
to]{.underline} **[clarify to adversaries]{.underline}**, including
China, [how it will]{.underline} **[constrain its]{.underline}** own
**[behavior in cyberspace]{.underline}** specifically
[during]{.underline} [**nuclear crises**. The potential]{.underline}
[implications of]{.underline} **[misperceptions]{.underline}**
[surrounding cyber operations targeting nuclear systems during a future
crisis with a nuclear-armed adversary are simply]{.underline} **[too
significant]{.underline}**.

#### Even without escalation, successful attacks trigger a 'black start' scenario\-\--[distinct]{.underline} from blackouts AND an [existential risk]{.underline}

In the industrial world, when a switch is flipped, we take for granted
that it will produce light, boot a computer, illuminate a stadium or
activate a power plant. We know, of course, that power losses can and do
occur. Many of us have lit candles during a thunderstorm or brought out
extra blankets when a blizzard takes down transmission lines. As of this
writing, the most populated state in the United States, California, is
experiencing rolling blackouts.1 Yet [even in prolonged power outages,
we expect that electricity will be restored and, consequently, life will
return to normal]{.underline}. Perhaps we need ask, [however, what [if
power **cannot** be restored]{.mark} in a timely manner?]{.underline}
Concern is growing that in the not-too-distant future our electricity
supply could be irreparably compromised by a cyber attack. The issue
when considering a systemic grid failure of this nature is twofold: [how
did we reach a point where something so **critical**]{.underline} [to
**routine life** now]{.underline} [[presents an **existential
threat**]{.mark}, and what can we do to **mitigate** the risk of a
catastrophic grid attack?]{.underline}

This article posits that the emergence of cyber attacks on industrial
control systems, as a means of war or criminal menace, have reached a
level of sophistication capable of crippling those systems. This article
argues that a new grid security policy paradigm is required to thwart
catastrophic grid failure -- a paradigm that recognises the inextricable
link between commercial power generation and national security. In
section 5, seven policy recommendations are outlined that may, in part,
mitigate a future where [grid attacks pose **existential
risk**]{.underline} to nations and their citizenry. Those
recommendations are: first, develop a comprehensive insurance programme
to minimise the financial risk of grid disruption; second, train more
cybersecurity professionals with particular expertise in industrial
control systems; third, institute a federally mandated
information-sharing programme that is centralised under United States
Cyber Command; fourth, subsidise and/or incentivise cybersecurity
protections for small to mid-size utilities; fifth, provide university
grants for grid security research; sixth, integrate new technologies
with an eye towards securing the grid; and, lastly, formulate clear
rules of engagement for a military response to grid disruption.

The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with an
introduction to this complex topic. It is the aim of the author to give
orientation to this issue and its many branches in the hope that better
understanding will animate further curiosity and, ultimately, positive
action on the part of the reader. Although many skilled and earnest
people work tirelessly to prevent a grid failure scenario, it is
essential that more be added to their ranks each day. Advisors,
engineers, regulators, private counsel to power generators, and many
others who play roles in electric power production are crucial to this
subject. So, while this article provides entrée to the topic of grid
security, its long-term objective is to spur action by the entire
energy-related community. In the end, no one is immune to consequences
of grid failure and, therefore, everyone is responsible, in part, for
promoting grid integrity.2 In this regard, lawyers who represent various
actors in the energy sector are going to be faced with questions and
potential legal risks of a magnitude that they have never experienced
before.

1.2. Turning the power back on in a powerless world

[[**'Black start'**, not to be confused with]{.underline}]{.mark} the
term [[**'blackout'**, is]{.underline}]{.mark} the name given to [the
process of restoring an electric grid to operation without relying on
the **external** electric power transmission network to
**recover**]{.underline} from a total or partial shutdown.3 [At first
glance, this]{.underline} description [is unremarkable, but it implies a
disturbing catch-22 -- **[how]{.mark} might [one restore power if the
entire]{.mark}**]{.underline} external transmission **[[network is
compromised]{.mark}?]{.underline}**

[If an electric disruption occurs at a household level, some homes may
be equipped with a modest gasoline generator to temporarily restore
power. If a hospital loses power, it will almost invariably be
resupplied by automatic, industrial-scale generators. These **micro**
considerations hardly give **anyone pause**]{.underline}; they are
hiccups on a stormy night or a snowy day. In other words, their 'black
start' is a quick and effective process for restoring power. [But what
happens, at a macro level, when an electric **grid** supplying power to
**large portions**]{.underline} [of the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [goes black,
or]{.underline} worse, [what happens if **all**]{.underline} of the
United States' electric [grids go down **simultaneously?**]{.underline}4
In that scenario, how might enough non-grid power be harnessed and
transmitted to turn the United States' lights back on? Moreover, how
might such a catastrophe occur in the first place? Perhaps
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} more **[ominous
[question]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[is]{.underline} [**not how**, but
**whether**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[or not [we]{.mark} can
[survive]{.mark}]{.underline}** such circumstances if they persist in
the long term.

The United States electric grid ('the grid') is the 'largest
interconnected machine' in the world.5 It consists of more than 7000
power plants, 55,000 substations, 160,000 miles of high-voltage
transmission lines and millions of low-voltage distribution lines.6 The
scale and complexity of the grid in the context of the modern digital
world are beyond comprehension because within it are innumerable
industrial control systems; incalculable connections to digital
networks; millions, if not billions, of analogue or digital sensors;
many thousands of human actors; and trillions of lines of programming
code.7 Further complexifying the grid is that it is comprised of
generations of technologies, stitched together in ways that are not
inherently secure in a world of cyber threats.8 The vastness of the grid
makes security of it challenging. Likewise, [the **vastness** of the
grid makes the opportunities for intrusion **seemingly
infinite**]{.underline}.

[By **any measure**, [grid **failure**]{.mark} will [unleash a **parade
of horrors**]{.mark}. **Stores** would **close**, [**food**
scarcity]{.mark} would follow, **[communication]{.mark}** would [cease,
**garbage**]{.mark} would **[pile up]{.mark}**, planes would be
grounded, clean **[water]{.mark}** would [become a **luxury**]{.mark},
service stations would yield **no fuel**, **[hospitals]{.mark}**
would]{.underline} eventually **[[go dark]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
financial **[[transactions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [would [stop]{.mark},
and this is only the **tip of the iceberg**]{.underline} -- in a
prolonged grid failure [**[social chaos]{.underline}** [would
reign]{.underline}]{.mark}[, once-eradicated [**diseases**
would]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[re-emerge]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[and]{.underline}, increasingly, [hope of returning to a normal life
would fade]{.underline}.9 The notion of complete grid failure, once
relegated to science fiction comics or James Bond movies, is now not
only possible but also one of the most pressing national security
threats today.10

Attacks on electric facilities are already occurring. In 2017, Duke
Energy Corporation, one of the United States' largest electricity
producers, recorded more than 650 million cyber attempts to breach its
utility systems.11 Duke Energy provides electricity to 7.6 million
customers in six states.12 Aside from the obvious risk that a successful
breach poses to Duke Energy, the effort to combat these attacks is
costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars in security
upgrades.13 Duke Energy is not alone; according to a recent study
conducted by the cybersecurity firm BitSight, about ten per cent of
electric utility companies are infected by malware.14 Perhaps one the
most worrisome instances of a cyber intrusion came recently when a
Kansas nuclear facility was hacked -- the perceived purpose of the hack
remains either unknown or undisclosed.15

[Thus far, intrusions into]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [grid assets have not resulted in damage to
such facilities]{.underline} (or, at least, such an event has not been
disclosed). [These events are often classified as 'surveillance'
tactics]{.underline}, not disruptive.16 [However, evidence abounds of
utility hacks that have resulted in real-world, negative impacts. In
2015, a '**[Russia]{.mark}**n intelligence unit [shut off power
to]{.mark} hundreds of thousands of people in western
**[Ukraine]{.mark}**'.]{.underline}17 Although the power was only off
for a few hours, American investigators discovered similarities between
the Ukraine disruption and surveillance of comparable United States
utilities.18 A year later, in 2016, Ukraine was attacked again, and the
results were similar to those of the 2015 attack.19 However, the
sophistication of the reconnaissance and the attack method had improved
noticeably.20 [Events like this are]{.underline} **[not
unique]{.underline}** to Ukraine; for example, a petrochemical plant in
Saudi Arabia was attacked in 2017.21 That breach focused on the safety
control system of the plant, which could have resulted in wide-scale
destruction and/or deaths of plant workers.22 In the past several weeks,
reports of Iranian attacks on United States grid operations have been
disclosed.23 These are just a few publicised incidents, and they
illustrate the breadth of the threat and the potential consequences
facing industrial nations. [Should [an attack **akin**]{.mark} to the
Ukraine intrusion come to fruition [in the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
[the results [could be **catastrophic**]{.mark} **in
scope**]{.underline}.

In light of the severity of this risk and the ever-growing likelihood of
attack success, nations must take immediate action to both prevent a
blackout scenario and, if needed, be prepared to confront a black start.
[Blackouts are **troubling** in their own right, but the **crux** of
this entire topic rests on one overarching concern -- when faced with a
**black start**, how will power be restored and how long will it take? A
blackout lasting a few **hours** is very different from a blackout that
lasts weeks or **months**]{.underline}. Thus, the lynchpin in thinking
about grid security is how to prevent a failure so that we may avoid the
immense challenges that would surely follow.

In the coming sections, this article will explain why we find ourselves
faced with this troublesome challenge. It will also delve into some of
the technical aspects of grid security as well as offer a step-by-step
look at how an attack occurs. Finally, this article will provide
solutions aimed reducing the peril of a black start reality.

2\. A brief history of the grid and what threatens it

2.1. How the United States produces and distributes power

The power transmission grid of the United States at its most expansive
level is known as the North American Reliability Councils and
Interconnections (or, as it is commonly called, the 'North American
Grid').24 The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)
governs the North American Grid.25 The North American Grid includes two
major and three minor NERC interconnections, which extend as far north
as Alaska and as far south as Baja California near Mexico.26 In effect,
the United States and Canada share power through various interconnection
networks.27

The contiguous United States grid is generally comprised of three
distinct grid systems.28 The Eastern Interconnection grid comprises most
of the Great Plains eastward to the Atlantic coast (excluding Texas).29
The Western Interconnection includes the Rocky Mountain States, portions
of the Great Plains, and all states westward to the Pacific Ocean
(excluding Texas).30 Finally, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas
(ERCOT) covers most of Texas.31 These interconnections make up the
electric power system of the contiguous United States.32 For purposes of
considering grid failure, it is critical to note that the three
interconnections discussed here function as largely independent systems
with limited exchanges of power between them. Thus, when the phrase
'grid failure' is used, it could refer to the failure of one of these
interconnections, all of these interconnections or some combination of
them.

Each of the aforementioned interconnections has a grid architecture that
is similar and is generally divided into two categories: the 'bulk power
system, often referred to as the "transmission grid,"' and the smaller
distribution grids.33 The bulk power system is the backbone of the grid.
'It connects high-capacity power plants, transmission wires and
substations that collectively generate and transport huge quantities of
electricity over hundreds or thousands of miles'.34 At this macro level
of power generation and transmission, regulatory standards are at their
most uniform and strongest. Moreover, at the bulk power system level,
most security regulations are mandatory, which yields consistent
safeguards across large swathes of the grid.35 Collaboration among
utility companies at the bulk power system level is often proficient,
and their cybersecurity practices are often cutting edge. This is not to
suggest, however, that the bulk power system is impervious to
disruption.

The bulk power system has three fundamental weaknesses. First, even with
the most advanced cybersecurity monitoring technology and personnel
resources to prevent an attack, it can still be hacked.36 Second, an
attack on the bulk power system could have systemic ramifications given
its overall importance to power generation and transmission throughout
the United States. Third, the bulk power system is integrated with
smaller distribution grids that are far less secure. This characteristic
creates a weak link in even the best cyber defence of the bulk power
system because the smaller distribution grids are less secure against
cyber intrusion.37

The smaller distribution grids (ie the non bulk power system) that are
connected to the transmission grid are key in delivering electricity to
homes and businesses. Additionally, smaller utility companies, as
opposed to the corporations that manage the bulk power system, readily
manage these smaller distribution networks.38 To put this in some
context, the United States has approximately 3000 utilities, and many of
those oversee small portions of the overall grid.39 With fewer resources
than large public utilities as well as fewer regulatory safeguards,
small utilities companies are less equipped to thwart cyber attacks.40
Hackers, notably those connected with Russia, have taken notice of this
fact and have exploited smaller, weaker utilities.41 These utilities
'have trouble finding sufficiently skilled workers who understand how
the computerized and physical components of the grid work together and
how to protect them'.42 Although bigger utility companies often
establish best cyber defence practices, smaller utility companies either
cannot afford or are not inclined to adopt those protections.43 The only
upside when assessing the vulnerabilities of smaller distribution grids
is that if an attack is limited to a single, minor grid, then the attack
will likely have fewer negative consequences.

While efforts are underway to promote better cyber defence management
across the entire grid, small or large, another element of power
generation and distribution poses a risk: the grid component supply
chain. All utilities rely on complex, global supply chains for equipment
and software.44 It is not easy nor is it customary to ensure the
integrity of each component of grid technology. For instance, an
industrial control system in a safety component of a power planet may
have software developed in Germany and hardware developed in China.
Unbeknownst to the utility, the Chinese hardware may be equipped to
provide Chinese hackers with backdoor access to the device because of an
undetected bug in the German software. This scenario could, in effect,
give Chinese hackers direct and surreptitious control of the safety
equipment. This type of intrusion is known as 'phoning home'.45 The
burden and cost that would be inflicted upon utility companies to
inspect integrity at each step of their supply chains is significant.46

Thankfully, the federal government has recognised the supply chain
dilemma and has taken steps to mitigate this danger. The Committee on
Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which is an
inter-agency committee of the federal government, promotes national
security by regulating foreign commercial efforts to influence United
States business.47 In 2018, Congress expanded CFIUS' authority by
passing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA).48
Among many expansions of authority, FIRRMA equipped CFIUS to review
transactions that may impact 'critical infrastructure' such as the
grid.49 While this is an improvement, the change does not go so far as
to give CFIUS authority over vendor relationships that lack an
investment component.50 Thus, utility companies, large and small,
continue to rely on technology from third-party vendors that may contain
exploitive features that permit grid disruption.

In effect, the United States grid is a patchwork quilt of digital and
physical technology from innumerable sources. To provide absolute cyber
defence of this system would require surveillance and analysis of every
single component of the grid, yet it is impossible to even properly
inventory every single component of the grid let alone monitor it
perfectly.

To add further complexity to the grid, new technology is emerging each
day that expands the vectors of potential cyber attacks. The phrase
'Internet of Things' is used to describe physical devices that are
linked to Internet communication systems.51 An example of an Internet of
Things device would be a refrigerator that automatically orders more
avocadoes from Amazon when only one avocado remains within it.52 This
may seem like an innocuous and overall convenient approach to modern
life, but such devices pose immense security challenges.

In the world of electricity distribution, Internet of Things instruments
often come in the form of so-called 'smart meters'.53 A smart meter is a
device that monitors electricity consumption in real time and relays
that information back to consumers and/or utilities.54 This is done
through a two-way communication system, much like the download/upload
function of a smart television.55 Smart meters also have the ability to
decrease or increase energy supply based on real-time energy-demand
monitoring.56 It is expected that 588 million smart meters will be
installed worldwide by 2022.57

The problem here is the vast amount of infrastructure needed to support
such a setup. Any smart electric grid needs a parallel
telecommunications network to collect and harness the volumes of data it
will generate, and that makes every connected thermostat or smart
refrigerator a potential entry point for cyber intruders.58

The bottom line is that Internet of Things devices have the potential to
transform the 'largest interconnected machine in the world' into a
machine that is infinitely more complex and more vulnerable that it is
presently. That being said, if smart grid technology is developed with
grid security as a fundamental objective then it may afford greater
security, rather than less.59

Finally, no understanding of the grid is complete without a glimpse at
its regulator. The US Department of Energy is the principal federal
agency responsible for regulating the nation\'s electricity generation
and distribution system. The specific division of the Department of
Energy tasked with grid integrity is the Office of Electricity Delivery
& Energy Reliability (OEDER).60 The OEDER works in coordination with
other federal agencies tasked with cybersecurity matters, but it
spearheads the Department of Energy's planning and implementation of
grid security. The OEDER Multiyear Plan for Energy Security
Cybersecurity ('plan'), released in March 2018, details how the federal
government will deepen partnerships with energy sector producers --
notably, however, the plan states that 'energy owners and operators have
the primary responsibility to protect their systems from all types of
risk'.61 The plan states that it has three priorities: first, strengthen
energy sector cybersecurity partnerships; second, coordinate cyber
incident response and recovery; and, third, accelerate game-changing
research and development of resilient energy delivery systems.62

Among the Department of Energy\'s various grid security concerns, one
overarching point of frustration is the high cost that energy providers
must absorb to protect their utilities. In 2015, cybercrime attacks
generated an average direct cost per company of \$27 million per year,
which is added on top of the \$150 million to \$800 million spent by the
average utility to protect its assets.63 Moreover, these costs are
increasing at approximately 11 per cent per year.64 At the present time,
there is little reason to believe that the US federal government will
absorb some or all of these costs, although efforts are underway to
nationalise grid security protocols.65

The Department of Energy may have the most direct regulatory authority
over the electric grid, but as the grid becomes more elemental to
broader national security concerns, oversight of the grid will broaden
to other federal agencies. In the event of a crippling grid attack, the
United States would face three overarching issues: first, there would be
a national security issue related to defending the United States from a
potential aggressor; second, there would likely be immediate and severe
economic disruption; and, lastly, there would be social dislocation and
a burden placed on emergency services.66 Due to these concerns, federal
management of the grid is likely to expand beyond the purview of the
Department of Energy and become more of an interagency concern.67 This
is already occurring, but as grid attacks multiply the interest of a
wider government role becomes essential. The principal agencies that
will likely continue to expand their authority over grid management are
the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department
of Commerce and Department of the Treasury. This underscores the fact
that the electric grid is essential to multiple facets of modern life.
It is in effect a keystone to national security, and to economic and
social normalcy.

2.2. What are cyber attacks, and how do they impact the grid?

Cyber attacks manifest in numerous ways, from credit-card-data heists to
physical destruction of uranium enrichment facilities.68 Because of this
feature, it is often challenging to sufficiently define a cyber attack,
but Merriam-Webster defines it as 'an attempt to gain illegal access to
a computer or computer system for the purpose of causing damage or
harm'.69 It is in the nature of the damage or harm inflicted that cyber
attacks take on so many forms. Generally, cyber attacks come in two
varieties, either cybercrime or cyber warfare.70

Cybercrime includes financial fraud, identify theft, corporate
espionage, hacktivism and a myriad of other forms that are notable for
their lack of national security implications.71 Frequently, the tools of
the trade used in cyber aggression are developed and honed in the
cybercrime domain. In cybercrime, the individual or entity initiating an
attack may go up against a secure system, but one that is not as well
equipped to respond as the United States military or other branches of
the government. Russian hackers in the Heartland Payment Systems data
breach, although ultimately caught and sentenced to time in a federal
prison, gained valuable training in the cyber attack field when they
stole 130 million credit card numbers.72 Similarly, ongoing acts of
Chinese cyber espionage, known as 'Titan Rain', have resulted in
extensive data collection from federal government systems (including,
but not exclusive to, the United States Department of Defense).73
Cybercrime, not to be discounted in its severity and destructive
capacity, can be thought of as a precursor for the more sophisticated
and existential threats posed by cyber warfare. The data collected
through cybercrime, along with the tools and tactics that are honed, in
effect sharpen the sword that can be used in cyber war.

Cyber war, much as the name suggests, is the execution of war strategies
through cyber attacks.74 Unlike cybercrime, cyber war is often the
result of state action as opposed to non-state actors, and it often
carries higher stakes than cybercrime. A caveat to this point, however,
is that state actors may rely on non-state actors to administer cyber
attacks as a means of making attribution more difficult.75 In its most
direct form, cyber warfare involves attacks on military assets. However,
the National Intelligence Council Report Global Trends 2025 made a
distressing comment that suggests cyber attacks could extend beyond the
battlefield of traditional military targets: 'Cyber and sabotage attacks
on critical US economic, energy, and transportation infrastructure might
be viewed by some adversaries as a way to circumvent \[United States\]
strengths on the battlefield and attack directly \[United States\]
interests at home'.76

For purposes of this article, it is the National Intelligence Council\'s
reference to critical infrastructure that is most relevant. Properly
functioning transportation systems, energy production, Internet services
and financial markets are essential to modern life, but among the
various forms of critical infrastructure none is perhaps more essential
than electricity production and distribution. Without a functioning
grid, the aforementioned elements of society are all diminished. This
fact makes grid security a leading concern in any discussion of cyber
attack risk. In other words, we have entered a phase in modern life
where war strategy may, and likely will, include tactics designed to
disrupt or disable an essential element of our civilisation -- our
ability to produce and distribute electricity to our population. At the
risk of hyperbole, this feature of 21st century war-making turns a cyber
threat into a potential existential threat.

3\. The current situation

3.1. Global order vs global mayhem

It is fair to question whether our electric grid is truly at risk of a
major attack and subsequent disruption. After all, it is a premise that
supports billions of dollars of private security expenses, animates fear
among the public and could prompt elected officials to over-react and
over-regulate, and it may be used by military institutions to justify
expanded powers into everyday life. Therefore, we must ask ourselves if
catastrophic grid failure as a result of a cyber attack is really the
risk that it might appear to be in modern life. Put differently, are we
in a pre-September-11 moment or are we simply dabbling in apocalyptic
paranoia?

The topic of nation state hacking often leads to Russia because few
countries have demonstrated both the will and the acumen needed to
execute large-scale cyber attacks.77 To answer the question of whether
electric grid hacking is a figment of science fiction or a tangible
threat, we start with Ukraine.

The first wave of Ukrainian grid attacks occurred on 23 December 2015,
when a third party successfully gained entry into and control over
electricity distribution substations (the systems of a distribution
network essential to transmit electric power to end consumers).78 The
outages lasted several hours, shut off power for approximately 225,000
individuals, and occurred through discrete attacks about every half
hour.79 Switching to manual override systems eventually restored power,
which is an essential component of attack mitigation. To add insult to
injury, the responsible party also jammed call centres to prevent
affected customers from reporting power outages.80

Robert Lee, a former cyber warfare operations officer for the United
States Air Force and co-founder of Dragos Security, said the Ukraine
attack was 'brilliant'.81 He went on to highlight that the attack was
sophisticated in terms of logistics, operations and the malware tools
used.82 Lee also suggests that the attack was likely coordinated among
various actors, including but not exclusive to cybercriminals and nation
states.83 Lee is reluctant to attribute the hack to any one actor,
including Russia; however, that has not stopped Ukraine from blaming
their former Soviet master.84 This highlights a recurring problem with
cyber attacks: namely, that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to
attribute blame to the responsible party.85

It may be that the 2015 Ukrainian grid attack was simply a harbinger of
things to come, because the Ukrainian grid was struck again almost a
year later, in 2016.86 The 2016 attack impacted fewer electric
customers, but demonstrated improved sophistication compared with the
2015 shut down.87 Marina Krotofil, a Ukrainian researcher for Honeywell
Industrial Cyber Security Lab, surmised that the 2016 hack was more of a
'demonstration of capabilities' than an attack meant to cripple
Ukraine\'s grid.88

In the end, Ukraine emerged from these attacks mostly unscathed, but the
events marked a far more troubling revelation: that Ukraine is merely a
testing ground for cyber warfare tools and tactics.89 Since 2016,
Ukraine has become ground zero for cyber war shows of force:

'Ukraine is \[a\] live-fire space', says Kenneth Geers, a veteran
cybersecurity expert and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who
advises NATO\'s Tallinn cyber center and spent time on the ground in
Ukraine to study the country\'s cyber conflict. Much like global powers
\[that\] fought proxy wars in the Middle East or Africa during the Cold
War, Ukraine has become a battleground in a cyberwar arms race for
global influence.90

While it may at first seem desirable to other nations for Ukraine to
bear the burden of being a proverbial testing ground, what happens in
Ukraine is not staying in Ukraine. Rather, Ukraine is simply a
sharpening stone for the swords that are likely to be used against
stronger adversaries like the United States and its NATO allies.

Contemporaneous with the Ukraine attacks, US grid systems were suffering
similar intrusions. Unlike the Ukraine hacks, the US grid intrusion did
not result in a lights-out scenario; however, Jonathan Homer, chief of
industrial-control-system analysis for the Department of Homeland
Security, said that attacks 'got to the point where they could have
thrown switches'.91 To this day, the grid is still under frequent
attack.92 Many grid security experts suspect Russia is involved in the
bulk of the grid intrusion efforts, but also express concern that Iran
and North Korea are probing weaknesses in grid defence.93 Attempts to
infiltrate and possibly disrupt power distribution has extended to
attacks on nuclear power plants.94 The plant in question -- the Wolf
Creek Generating Station in Burlington, Kansas -- suffered intrusions
into its business network, which suggests that hackers were probing for
possible ways to access industrial control systems within the plant.95
Fortunately, the intrusion did not result in an operational impact.
However, the incident proves that efforts are underway to exploit even
the most sensitive and dangerous components of the grid.

The testing of cyber weaponry abroad and the discoveries of foreign
reconnaissance at home all raise the same alarming question: if these
are the means, what is the end? In part, foreign actors likely see cyber
warfare as a way of asymmetrically confronting the vast power of the
United States military (and its NATO allies).96 It remains merely
speculative at this time whether a large-scale grid disruption is the
goal of foreign actors engaged in these activities. Nonetheless, it is
evident that the will is present and the methods are growing more
sophisticated; thus, it is reasonable to conclude that under certain
geopolitical circumstances a massive grid attack in the United States
could occur as a consequence of advancing larger asymmetrical military
and/or political objectives. This possibility, combined with the
increasing volume of threats in the cyber realm, suggests that world
affairs are trending more towards conflict and less towards peace, and
it further suggests that such conflict may manifest itself in ways that
extend beyond the confines of traditional battlefields.

3.2. What the United States is doing now -- offence and defence

There is no question that grid security is a top issue for policymakers,
and, relatedly, there is no shortage of efforts underway or aspired to
for purposes of fortifying the grid. At a federal level, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has been stepping up its reporting
mandates. New standards published by FERC last summer require the NERC
to report cybersecurity attacks that 'compromise or attempt to
compromise electronic security perimeters, electronic access control or
monitoring systems, and physical security perimeters'.97 While this is
certainly a positive development favouring a stronger grid, there is
wide discretion granted by FERC to NERC on what sorts of attacks
constitute an incident98 that would then trigger disclosure.

In addition to disclosure requirements, the government recently
announced the Pathfinder programme, which is a collaborative effort
among the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Defense.99 The
purpose of Pathfinder is to 'advance information sharing, improve
training and education to understand systemic risks, and develop joint
operational preparedness and response activities ... '.100 In addition
to Pathfinder, there are more than 27 other programmes within the
federal government tasked with protecting the electric grid from some
form of failure.101

At a legislative level, the United States Congress has been busy as
well. Most notably, the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act (SEIA), which
passed last summer, establishes a pilot programme designed to decrease
grid digitisation and bolster manual backup systems.102 The idea behind
SEIA is that if grid systems have a reliable manual backup available to
operators in the event that a cyber attack disrupts digital systems,
then the duration of potential blackout will be less severe.103
Inspiration for this approach is varied, but it is supported in part
because the Ukrainian grid attack of 2015 was mitigated somewhat by the
use of backup manual controls.104

At a regulatory level, states are also taking an active role in grid
security. This is particularly important because much of the power
distribution system in the country falls outside of federal jurisdiction
(the federal government focuses mainly on the bulk power system).105
Therefore, states are establishing cybersecurity taskforce groups,
promulgating rules and standards, and establishing state-specific
disclosure requirements. In 2019, 16 states considered enacting measures
aimed at promoting grid resilience; California and Texas are leading the
pack in implementing cyber defence policies.106 Should this trend
continue, then it will help ameliorate a major concern in grid
protection, which is the need to standardise and monitor small utility
platforms that may not receive the attention they deserve at the federal
level.

Lastly, the United States has made clear that cyber offence is an
essential complement to cyber defence. The United States government has
made clear through word and deed that it is prepared to wage cyber
attacks in an offensive capacity as may be necessary. In September 2019,
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, while addressing the annual Cyber
Security Summit in Washington, DC, stated, 'We need to do more than play
goal line defense. As such, the department\'s 2018 Cyber Strategy
articulates a proactive and assertive approach to defend forward our own
virtual boundaries'.107 Secretary Esper elaborated that to 'defend
forward' means to 'disrupt threats at the initial source before they
reach our networks and systems'.108 The government has articulated this
point in greater detail in both the White House Cyber Policy and the
Department of Defense Cyber Strategy.109 In the former, the Trump
administration details that consequences will be imposed on any actors
that threaten or attack the United States through cyber means. Moreover,
the White House asserts that it will establish a cyber deterrence
initiative with partnering nations. The international coalition
envisioned by the deterrence initiative mirrors prior collective defence
arrangements that have been used in more traditional military
contexts.110

Beyond rhetoric and policy pronouncements, there is strong evidence to
suggest that the United States government has already used cyber
weaponry to disrupt industrial control systems in other countries. The
most well-documented instance of such an effort is the Stuxnet computer
virus.111 This virus, which emerged worldwide in 2010, was a cyber
weapon designed to infect the industrial control systems of the Iranian
nuclear programme, such that nuclear centrifuges used to produced
weapons-grade fissile material would spin out of control to the point of
self destruction.112 To that end, Stuxnet was successful. It is
estimated that approximately 1000 centrifuges were destroyed at the
Natanz nuclear facility, or approximately ten per cent of the
centrifuges at that location. Although Stuxnet achieved a significant
policy objective of the United States, namely to set back the Iranian
nuclear programme, there has never been an official acknowledgement that
the United States had anything to do with Stuxnet. However, it is
believed that the United States and Israel jointly engineered Stuxnet to
strike at the core of Iran\'s nuclear ambitions. Regardless of whether
Stuxnet can be firmly attributed to an American-led effort, the virus
illustrates that computer code can cause tangible damage to industrial
control systems. Moreover, if the United States did originate Stuxnet,
then it demonstrates the United States is both capable of inflicting and
willing to inflict a kinetic blow against its enemies through the use of
cyber weaponry.

4\. Anatomy of an attack

4.1. A grid attack, step by step

Building on the information discussed in the prior sections of this
article, this section will explore what a grid attack could look like at
the micro level. Understanding the nature of the threat on a global
scale is essential for appreciating the nature and extent of the risk
posed to grid security, but ultimately this challenge will be met on a
detailed operational level. Therefore, it is key for individuals or
entities that may have responsibility for thwarting a grid attack to
comprehend on a granular level how such an attack could occur.

It is the aim of the author to equip the reader of this article with a
general knowledge of how a grid attack may unfold so that the reader may
become aware of instances in which their role or responsibilities might
entail opportunities to mitigate the risk of grid disruption. For
example, a reader of this article advising a power distribution company
should know that marketing materials for the company should never
include photographs of equipment (specifically, industrial control
systems) used at the power generation facility. Cyber aggressors, in
reconnaissance missions, may use imagery that unintentionally reveals
critical systems. Furthermore, this section borrows heavily from the
critical infrastructure report titled When the Lights Went Out,
published by Booz Allen Hamilton.113

Lastly, it is important to bear in mind that this overview is
hypothetical and simply one of many possible strategies to effectuate a
cyber attack. An actual attack may mirror many of the steps discussed
here, could vary slightly or significantly, and/or could utilise methods
that are presently unknown to the author or to the cybersecurity
community. Therefore, the reader should appreciate that the following is
but one script among many that a utility cyber attack could follow.
Accordingly, it is imperative to stay abreast of changes in cyber
offensive capabilities as well as to understand that the greatest
threats likely come from attack strategies that are novel and not yet
clearly envisioned.

\(1\) Reconnaissance and intelligence gathering:114 In advance of an
attack, the cyber aggressor will research the target through any manner
of publicly available information and/or through surreptitious
non-digital means. The example alluded to above of a marketing brochure
containing a photo of an industrial control system is the type of
publicly available information that may be instrumental in planning an
attack. If an attacker can determine the type of operational platform in
use, then that attacker can begin a plan to exploit that device. This
step may also include traditional spycraft methods, such as gaining
access to a target facility by seeking employment at that facility or
attempting to leverage someone presently employed at that facility,
perhaps through blackmail. Although a cyber attack against a grid
facility is a sophisticated, technical operation, it often begins with
non-technical fact gathering activities. Facilities should, therefore,
develop thorough employee monitoring procedures, prohibit visual or
photographic access to critical systems, eliminate public tours of
critical facilities, install port-scanning detection sensors, deny
employees use of personal email or similar applications while using
facility networks, etc.

\(2\) Malware development and weaponisation: Once an aggressor gains
insight into the systems used by a target facility, the aggressor will
commence procurement or development of the malware necessary to
effectuate an attack. Depending on the target, an attacker may need to
develop a novel cyber tool to gain access. In other instances, if an
attacker can utilise existing malware then they will often take that
course rather than write an entirely new programme. This is known as
'living off the land'.115 An infamous example of this occurred in 2017
when National Security Agency hacking tools were leaked in the
EternalBlue exploit.116 The malware gained from EternalBlue has been
used repeatedly to ransom data held by governments and corporations.117
While development and weaponisation occur external to a target, it is
critical that a target facility take steps to understand the types of
malware that are available and test those exploits against their own
systems in an effort to strengthen and inoculate critical operations
against known malware threats.

\(3\) Deliver remote access trojan: Once an attacker has determined the
vulnerabilities of a facility and developed or procured the malware
necessary to exploit those vulnerabilities, the next step is to begin
the intrusion. The first step of intrusion is the delivery of a remote
access trojan ('RAT') or some similar software to the business network.
The business network is distinct from the network that controls
industrial operation systems because the business network is where
routine corporate activity occurs, such as financial activity, legal
work, human resources, customer service and so forth. The industrial
network, on the other hand, is how the facility operates electricity
generation and distribution. Gaining access to a corporate network is a
necessary step towards gaining access to an industrial control network,
which is the ultimate target in successfully disrupting the grid. The
RAT or similar software grants the attacker access to the corporate
network, which then opens doors to a wider reconnaissance of the
facility. RATs achieve this end often by tricking corporate personnel
into granting the attack deeper network access; the trick can come in
the form of a phishing email that prompts a corporate employee to give
their network credentials or to download a seemingly innocuous file to
their computer. In the end, this step affords the attacker deeper
intrusion into a facility and puts the attacker one step closer to
disrupting operations. Methods of combating delivery of a RAT range from
having effective malware detection software to a prohibition on using
USB drives or accepting files from untrustworthy sources.

\(4\) Install RAT: Secondary to the delivery of the RAT, the RAT must be
installed. This typically occurs when an employee of the business
unwittingly installs the RAT to the corporate network. This is often
through a 'social engineering' method of attack because it exploits
human weakness to achieve an objective. An example of this would be
sending what appears to be an email from an employee\'s friend, spouse,
etc, that encourages the employee to download a file, such as a party
invitation, whereas it is actually an email from the attacker with
malware cloaked in a benign attachment. Another example of this would be
an attack where the attacker ostensibly applies for a job by sending an
application to human resources, but has embedded malware within the
attached resume. To combat RAT installation, much like the methods
discussed in the previous section, requires both employee education and
file monitoring on the corporate network.

\(5\) Establish command-and-control connection: Once malware is
successfully installed within a corporate network, the attacker utilises
that malware to establish a command and control connection (CCC) back to
an external server of the aggressor. It is at this point that the
attacking party gains actionable and unauthorised access to a grid
facility\'s corporate network. Having gained this access, the attacker
can now monitor traffic on the corporate network, research files held on
the network, harvest network user credentials such as passwords and
critical facility codes, upload additional malware and so on. For
facility defence at this level, a robust network firewall is essential
because by monitoring all communication done with an external server a
facility has a strong chance of detecting the attacker\'s activities.

\(6\) Deliver malware plugins: Building upon recently installed malware,
the attacker will now deliver malware plugins. The purpose of additional
plugins is to expand the range of network reconnaissance. An example of
a malware plugin would be a keystroke logger, which functions as a
recording device on an employee\'s computer that records each keyboard
input and then transmits that keystroke record back to the attacker.
Much like the antidote for other forms of malware, the target can defend
against this manner of intrusion with sophisticated and updated malware
detection software.

\(7\) Harvest credentials: Similar to the delivery of malware plugins,
the attacker will pursue a strategy of credential harvesting, or, in lay
terms, username and password theft. This is a critical step, because by
obtaining the login credentials of individuals with broad network
authority access the attacker can expand their reach throughout the
corporate network and, most importantly, into the industrial control
system network. This is a significant step towards both the disruption
of the grid and the attack\'s ability to navigate network traffic
largely undetected. In effect, the attacker subsumes the grid control
authority and access of an individual or individuals with the ability to
alter conditions of the industrial control network.

\(8\) Lateral movement and target identification on the corporate
network: This stage marks when an attacker effectively maps an entire
corporate network, or at least its essential components. This step may
require months of execution, but by the end of this phase the attacking
party should have full understanding of and access to relevant servers,
employee work stations, telecommunication infrastructure, power supply
and so on. Aside from monitoring for suspicious activity, network
defence should make efforts to compartmentalise network functions as a
means of thwarting comprehensive network movement. Another strategy to
detect intrusion at this level is to establish what are known as
honeypots, or network decoys, which are network files that serve no
useful purpose and would not be accessed by any employees in the normal
course of their work. If a series of these decoy files were accessed,
this would suggest some form of nefarious reconnaissance is underway.

\(9\) Lateral movement and target identification on Industrial Control
System (ICS) network: This is the stage of the attack in which the
attacking party jumps from the corporate network to the industrial
control network, ie the systems that provide operational control of the
facility\'s power generation and distribution network. An industrial
control system functions like a traditional, manual system except that
at key points of its operation it receives digital commands from either
automated operating instructions or human input. For example, a
hydroelectric power plant may continue producing power through the
physics of water-pressure-driven turbines until a human actor,
interacting with the facility through a digital control system like a
computer or more basic workstation, gives an instruction to the plant
control system to either cease power production or ramp it up, or to do
something else. These command systems can take many forms, but a basic
form is a human--machine interface workstation, which would likely be a
laptop type device that is directly connected to an industrial control
system, like a programme that has the authority to adjust the speed of a
hydroelectric turbine. Within the physical world of the facility, a
properly credentialed employee would be able to walk up to this
human--machine interface workstation and send a command to the control
system for the turbine to alter its operation. In the case of an outside
attack on the grid, the attacker would gain access to this workstation
remotely and use it to give a command as if the attacker were physically
present at the facility. At this stage, an attacker would not yet know
how to initiate an attack, but this would be the time when the attacker
explores the industrial control system network in an attempt to uncover
its vulnerabilities and to identify targets necessary to disrupt the
facility\'s operation. To prevent this stage from occurring, the
facility should configure a third, intermediate network between the
corporate network and the industrial control system network, wherein the
intermediate network acts as holding centre for cross-network traffic to
be evaluated. This is akin to a decontamination room that is used when a
virologist exits a secure room where they have been studying a dangerous
pathogen; the virologist is not permitted to exit a possibly
contaminated room without first going through a decontamination room and
then, upon approval, being released from that room back into a normal,
presumably virus-free environment. While this is not a foolproof method
of defending an industrial control system network, it does ensure that
an attacker\'s efforts are more closely scrutinised. Of note, this
measure is not the same as an air-gap system, ie a system that separates
the industrial control system network from the corporate network. It has
been demonstrated that an air-gap system is not practical nor is it as
secure as it may seem in theory.118

\(10\) Develop malicious firmware: Once an attacker has explored the
industrial control system network, uncovered its vulnerabilities, and
established control system targets, the attacker will develop a weapon
appropriate for disrupting those targets. The weapon will be some form
of malicious firmware. The attacker does not require access to either
the corporate or the industrial control system network during the
malicious firmware development stage; rather, the actor will perform
this process completely externally to the target facility. However, the
attacker may test the malicious firmware on other, similar targets as a
means of fine-tuning the efficacy of the weapon. This brings us back to
the issue of Ukraine. Ukraine has been and is the testing ground for a
host of cyber weapons, and it is generally accepted that malware
developed to strike grid-critical facilities are often tested in Ukraine
before being executed against their actual target.

\(11\) Deliver data destruction malware: Preceding an attack, the
aggressor will utilise its access to the facility networks (both
corporate and industrial control systems) to upload data-destruction
malware. The purpose of this malware is to preschedule the deletion of
pertinent data that would be relevant to restoring a system\'s
operational integrity. Although the deletion itself is not formally the
attack, it complements the attack by frustrating the assessment of what
is occurring during an attack as well as hobbling a defensive response
to an attack. The only means of confronting this stage of the attack is
to maintain robust scanning measures for malware.

\(12\) Schedule uninterruptable power supply disruption: Grid facilities
rely a continuous operation of critical systems during normal operation.
During an attack it is even more important to maintain power as a means
of ameliorating the disruption. However, using harvested credentials, an
attacker will preschedule the termination of otherwise uninterruptable
power supply (UPS) sources so that it becomes easier to execute multiple
attacks, to do so undetected and to debilitate restoration efforts. A
method of combating this tactic is to isolate UPS systems from the
corporate and/or industrial control system networks.

\(13\) Trip breakers: After months or even years of preparation, the
attack finally commences. Using access to the industrial control system
network and credentials that enable the manipulation of human--machine
interface systems, the attacker will issue a command to open the
breakers within the facility\'s power generation and distribution
system. The end result will be the disruption of power to a wide range
of consumers, measurable in the hundreds of thousands or millions. As
discussed above, it is essential to tightly control user access to the
industrial control system network, both internally and externally. At
this stage, the attack will become known to the facility and corrective
measures will likely ensue. For this reason, the attacker will then
commence additional attacks to derail any attempted defensive
procedures.

\(14\) Sever connection to field devices: Knowing that a facility
control centre will take immediate steps to close the breakers and
restore power to the grid, the attack will trigger malware that disrupts
power converters and cuts communication between the facility control
centre and its substations. The result is that breakers cannot be closed
remotely over the network and can only be closed manually. While this
may sound like an easy solution, the larger the attack, the longer
manual restoration will require. A robust system for monitoring
industrial control system network traffic and simulated attack and
restoration exercises are necessary to avoid this scenario.

\(15\) Telephony denial-of-service attack: At a corporate network level,
measures will immediately commence to register consumer complaints and
formulate a company action plan. As with most power outages, consumers
will begin calling the corporate call centre to report a disruption,
only now the attacker will flood the call centre with a telephony
denial-of-service attack so that the call centre effectively drowns in
fake calls and is rendered incapable of addressing legitimate consumer
complaints. In order to avoid this frustration, a power company should
partner with its phone service provider to develop a means of filtering
legitimate from fraudulent calls.

\(16\) Disable critical systems via UPS: At this stage, step 12 becomes
relevant as the attacker\'s prescheduled power outages begin to wreak
havoc on the response effort. Commonly, facility operators will take
steps to rely on backup power systems, but here they will find them
suspended and useless. This will add more chaos to an already chaotic
situation.

\(17\) Destroy critical system data: Finally, with the power disrupted,
control stations neutered and the power company thrown into a technical
maelstrom, the attacker will cut the jugular of the facility. With vast
access to the corporate and industrial control system networks, the
attack will trigger malware that systematically deletes data critical to
the operations of the facility. This step of the attack has the
potential to make internal restoration of power impossible. Moreover,
with the physical components of the facility effectively turned off and
the digital systems wiped of all critical data, the likelihood of power
restoration in the foreseeable future becomes questionable at best.

\(18\) Physical destruction of plant systems: Although the 17 prior
steps are adequate to turn the lights out, another element of a
successful attack warrants attention. Had the attacker initiated a
command that caused a power surge sufficient to burn up necessary
critical infrastructure, then not even manual restoration would remedy
the disruption.119 Under this scenario, power could only be restored by
installing new equipment, which, depending on the severity of the
attack, could be a protracted solution that requires years of work.

4.2. Post-mortem or restoration

If a large-scale cyber attack does come to fruition, what might be some
of the second-order effects? One example comes from a situation that
occurred in Wyoming in February 2017, when a strong windstorm knocked
down a large number of power lines.120 Because of the inoperable power
lines, along with heavy snow, power was not restored for approximately a
week. Generators initially powered sewage treatment facilities, but
eventually the generators began to fail and as a result sewage began
backing up. To avoid wastewater flooding into homes, the area\'s water
supply was cut off. One needs only a modest imagination to consider the
impact that a similar situation might have in New York City, Los
Angeles, London or any other major metropolitan area. And, to make
matters worse, curtailment of clean water could be only one of many
challenges resulting from lost power.121 This grave concern prompted
Lawrence Susskind at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\'s
urban systems department to remark, 'Millions ... could be left with no
electricity, no water, no public transportation, and no waste disposal
for weeks (or even months) ... . No one can protect critical urban
infrastructure on their own'.122

Combined with the social and economic turmoil that could be caused by a
crippling grid attack, there could be further difficulties caused by the
disruption to supply chains that would be necessary to restore power. At
an MIT facility doing work on wind turbine power generation, a
mechanical failure to the turbine took almost three months to fix
because a necessary part had to be developed and delivered from
Germany.123 [Expand a situation of [this]{.mark} type [across an

The pledge is the embodiment of the allies' security guarantee to each
other and the beating heart of NATO.

[After]{.underline} **[Russia invaded]{.underline}** Ukraine, NATO
Secretary General Jens **[Stoltenberg]{.underline}**
[confirmed]{.underline} that [NATO policy on]{.underline} collective
defense and **[cyber]{.underline}**space [holds]{.underline}
[**strong**, noting that NATO has "decided to]{.underline} **[make
clear]{.underline}** [that a cyberattack can **trigger Article
5**]{.underline}." And following an extraordinary meeting of heads of
state and government on March 24, [the alliance]{.underline}
**[reinforced]{.underline}** [that it is "**ready to impose
costs**]{.underline} on those who harm us in cyberspace."

[But despite]{.underline} this **[rhetoric]{.underline}**, [exactly
**how and when**]{.underline} [Article 5 applies to cyberspace remains
**unclear**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} ambiguity [is
a]{.underline} **[problem]{.underline}** --- [with]{.underline}
potentially **[disastrous consequences]{.underline}**. [Staking the
credibility of Article 5 to what are often **murky activities in
cyberspace**]{.underline} [threatens to **undermine**]{.underline} the
**[broader]{.underline}** principle of **[collective
defense]{.underline}**. [We can't risk **fracturing the**]{.underline}
transatlantic **[alliance]{.underline}** [at a **critical juncture in
its history**]{.underline} [over]{.underline} a debate on **[what
constitutes a major]{.underline}** or minor
**[cyberattack]{.underline}**. [For that reason, NATO
should]{.underline} move **[quickly]{.underline}** to **[clarify its
policy on cyberattacks]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} explicitly
**[state the threshold for what would trigger]{.underline}** an Article
5 **[response]{.underline}**. Furthermore, [NATO members should commit
to treating cyberattacks that do **not**]{.underline} [rise to the level
of a major attack as a **national** matter --- **not** one for the
**alliance**]{.underline}.

Such a shift might face some initial resistance, particularly in light
of the Kremlin's history of malicious cyber activities. One of the first
state-initiated cyberattacks was perpetrated by Russia against Estonia,
a NATO member, in 2007. In the intervening years, Moscow has increased
its malicious cyber activities, such as the SolarWinds breach uncovered
in December 2020 in which Russia gained access to a treasure trove of
U.S. data. Russian President Vladimir Putin's maneuvers against NATO
members, along with the annexation of Crimea in 2014, spurred the
alliance to adopt a Cyber Defense Pledge in 2016 that recognized
cyberspace as a military domain. Two years later, NATO created a
Cyberspace Operations Center in Mons, Belgium to improve situational
awareness and coordinate cyber operations. Since then, the alliance has
consistently reaffirmed the application of Article 5 to cyberspace. At
the 2021 summit in Brussels, NATO committed to a new Comprehensive Cyber
Defense Policy, with allies agreeing to employ the "full range of
capabilities" at all times to "deter, defend against, and counter the
full spectrum of cyber threats."

Notably, [NATO **refined its language**]{.underline} with last summer's
summit communique to account for the fact that some cyber incidents may
not be individually decisive, but nevertheless significant when viewed
in the aggregate. Specifically, the allies recognized "the impact of
significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain
circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack." [In
**practice**, however]{.underline}, NATO leaders [have]{.underline}
**[avoided]{.underline}** [clarifying the conditions under which a
cyberattack would trigger Article 5]{.underline} and how NATO would
respond. [When pressed about]{.underline} Russian cyberattacks in [the
**Ukraine** context]{.underline}, Stoltenberg
**[cautioned]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}, "[we have never gone
into the position where we give a potential adversary the privilege of
**defining exactly when we trigger Article 5**]{.underline}."

This equivocation is not surprising, for several reasons. The nature of
cyberspace often confounds unequivocal deterrence declarations. States
tend to operate in cyberspace with plausible deniability, which can make
it difficult to rapidly ascertain responsibility for cyber incidents.
Also, it can be challenging to understand the intent behind observed
cyber behavior, and there is often a substantial time lag between when
an initial penetration of a network occurs and when the target even
realizes the breach. And the vast majority of cyber operations cause
virtual, not physical, damage, complicating efforts to assess and
evaluate the implications of the costs inflicted. Moreover, it can take
time to develop and identify a way to infiltrate a network as well as
the computer code that takes advantage of a vulnerability for malicious
ends. This means states may lack a palatable cyber response option for
retaliatory purposes at the desired time.

[This creates a **slew of practical problems**]{.underline} [if Article
5 were to be invoked]{.underline} for a cyberattack. [From an
implementation perspective, it would trigger
**deliberations**]{.underline} within the North Atlantic Council, NATO's
primary decision-making body. [Decisions]{.underline} made
[within]{.underline} the [NAC require **unanimity**, which can be
difficult to achieve]{.underline} for many issues but is especially
burdensome [for cyber]{.underline} ones, [given]{.underline} all of the
[ambiguities]{.underline} outlined above. [The most likely
outcome]{.underline} of this process [would be a long, drawn-out
deliberation resulting in a **divided alliance**]{.underline} **[unable
to agree]{.underline}** [on **how** or **whether** to respond. Quite
simply, some allies are **unlikely to want to risk World War III for a
cyberattack**]{.underline} that disrupts the financial infrastructure,
for instance, of another country [but doesn't lead to **loss of
life**]{.underline} or sustained damage.

These challenges have major strategic implications for NATO. After years
of publicly and repeatedly linking Article 5 to cyberspace and
reinforcing that policy in response to the Ukraine conflict, a failure
to achieve consensus and respond to a Russian cyberattack against a NATO
member could imperil Article 5 in other areas. [The]{.underline}
**[disunity]{.underline}** [that is likely to be revealed during NAC
deliberations would then **undermine**]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
**[broader political cohesion]{.underline}** [that has, for the most
part, been **remarkably strong throughout the war**]{.underline} in
Ukraine. [This would make it more difficult for the alliance to respond
to **other** forms of Russian behavior]{.underline}. As Biden emphasized
at a press conference last month, "[the]{.underline} **[single-most
important thing is for us to stay unified]{.underline}** ... We have to
stay fully, totally, thoroughly unified."

#### That triggers [broader]{.underline} deterrence failures\-\--it's [existential]{.underline}

["Hybrid" scenarios: trigger for conflict?]{.underline}

[[One can envisage]{.mark} a number of "**[hybrid" scenarios]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Russia-NATO conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[where operations]{.mark} which started in the **cyber**]{.underline},
**[economic]{.underline}**, **[criminal]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline}
"**[active measure"]{.underline}** [domains]{.underline}, **[below the
threshold of conflict]{.underline}**, [[trigger a **military
response**]{.underline}]{.mark} [or are followed by the **physical use
of force.**]{.underline} As noted in the discussion on the definitions
of a conflict, [the [**threshold** between **crisis** and]{.mark}
military [**conflict** may not be]{.mark} **explicitly
stated**]{.underline} [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} otherwise
**[[clear]{.mark} to all sides]{.underline}**; [and it [may]{.mark} also
[be **ignored** during a crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This aspect is
especially relevant in the current period of **increased interference**
in the internal affairs of NATO countries attributed to Russia and of
the **high volume of information 'warfare'** between Russia and NATO
countries.]{.underline}

Russia remains vigilant about foreign interference in its internal
affairs and the threat of subversion leading to a severe destabilization
of the regime. In the past, Moscow has made accusations about foreign
sponsorship of Chechen and radical Islamic terrorists targeting Russia,
and has alleged the existence of training camps on the territories of
NATO states for activists planning colour revolutions in Ukraine and
Belarus. In the extreme circumstances of a crisis, [if]{.underline} the
[Russian leadership became convinced that a non-military campaign
against it]{.underline} (which might also involve cyber activities and
what Russia calls attempts to instigate colour revolutions) [had
intensified, this could lead to a **military response.**]{.underline}

[With regards to NATO, [some]{.mark} of its [members' view]{.mark}s
mirror the Russian assessment that [we are **already in** ]{.mark}**a
state of [conflict,]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[in which the
**boundary** between **peace** and **war** is **blurred**]{.underline},
[and that their defences are being **actively attacked**]{.underline}
[through **nonmilitary means.**]{.underline} [[They are]{.mark} thus
[concerned about a scenario in which Russia]{.mark} **initiates an
attack**]{.underline} [that [moves **swiftly**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[from **non-military to military means**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
scenario should be not dismissed. At the same time, one needs to be wary
of interpreting all disturbing developments as part of a grand Russian
plan culminating in a provocation or use of force. So [[there should be
**prudence** before any country **presses the "panic
button"**]{.underline} [at]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the]{.underline}
national or [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} / European Union
[level]{.underline}. There should also be close analysis of early
warning indicators related to the gravity, intensity and diversity of
incidents and to connections between them. The overall political context
and state of the RussiaNATO relationship would also be important: what
would be the political and strategic reasons for Russia to move from
sub-threshold to abovethreshold activities?

**[Escalation]{.underline}**: [Can a NATO - Russia conflict be
**managed**?]{.underline}

[[Once a conflict was under way, the **"fog of war"**]{.mark} and
**rising unpredictability** [would]{.mark} **inevitably [set
in]{.mark}**, [complicating]{.mark} the implementation of any
[**predetermined theories** of]{.mark} **escalation**,
**[deescalation]{.mark}** and **inter-conflict management**. The
**[actual dynamics]{.mark}** of a conflict [and]{.mark} the
**[perceptions of]{.mark} the [stakes]{.mark}**]{.underline} [involved
[are]{.mark} extremely **[difficult to predict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Simulations and table-top exercises can give only limited insights into
the actual decisionmaking processes and interactions.

Still, [[Russian]{.mark} [military theorists]{.mark} and practitioners
seem to [assume]{.mark} that a [conflict with NATO can be
**managed**]{.mark} and controlled in a way that would bring it to a
swift end consistent with Russian aims.]{.underline} The Russian theory
of victory would seek to exploit weak points in an Alliance war effort.
[Based on the conviction that democracies are weak and their leaders and
populations are risk-averse, Russia [may assume]{.mark} that [its
threats of]{.mark} horizontal or [**vertical escalation** could
be]{.mark} particularly **[effective]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It would
also try to bring home the notion that it has much higher stakes in the
conflict (regime survival) than a majority of the NATO members involved,
and thus will be ready to push the boundaries of the conflict further.
It [[would]{.mark} most likely [try to]{.mark} **[test]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[exploit]{.mark}** potential **[divisions]{.mark} within
the Alliance**]{.underline}, combining selective diplomacy and
activation of its intelligence assets in some NATO states with a degree
of selectivity in terms of targets of particular attacks.

[[Any]{.mark} NATO-Russia [conflict would **inevitably have a nuclear
dimension**]{.mark}**.** The role of nuclear weapons [as]{.mark} a
**tool for [escalation control]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for
Russia]{.mark} has been thoroughly debated]{.underline} by experts, [but
when and how Russia might use]{.underline} (and not merely showcase or
activate) [nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an **open
question**]{.underline}. [Beyond **catch phrases** such as "**escalate
to de-escalate"**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} "**[escalate to
win]{.underline}**" [there are a wider range of options for Russian
nuclear weapon use]{.underline}. For example, [a single nuclear warning
shot could be lethal or non-lethal]{.underline}. It [could be directed
against a purely military target or a military-civilian
one]{.underline}. [Detonation could be configured for an EMP
effect]{.underline}. A "false flag" attack is also conceivable. [These
options might be used]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[signal
escalation]{.underline}** and could significantly complicate NATO's
responses.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. It is less
clear how far the Alliance would be willing to escalate the conflict to
achieve these goals, and what mechanisms and means it would use while
trying to maintain some degree of control over the conflict.

[The goals and methods of waging a conflict with Russia would probably
have to be limited in order to]{.underline} **[avoid a massive nuclear
exchange]{.underline}**. Such limitations would also involve
restrictions on striking back against targets on Russian territory.
[But]{.underline} **[too narrow an approach]{.underline}** [could put
**too much restraint** on NATO's operations: the Russian regime's
**stability** may ultimately need to be **threatened** in order to
**force the leadership into terminating the conflict**]{.underline}.
NATO would thus need to establish what a proportional self-defence
response to Russian actions would involve, and to what extent cyber
operations or attacks against military targets in quite different parts
of Russia would be useful as tools of escalation to signal NATO's
resolve. Moreover, individual NATO Allies, especially those directly
affected by Russia's actions, might pursue their individual strategies
of escalation.

With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance, with the US taking the
lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

[[Relying on concepts of escalation control]{.mark} and on lessons [from
the **Cold War**]{.mark} confrontation [might be
**misleading**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The circumstances in
which a Russia -NATO conflict would play out would be **radically
different**]{.underline} from the 20th century screenplay. Moreover,
[[instead of **gradual**]{.underline}]{.mark} (**[linear]{.underline}**)
[[escalation or **salami tactics**]{.mark} **escalation**]{.underline},
[[it is possible to imagine **surprizing** "**leap frog"
escalation**]{.underline},]{.mark} [possibly [connected with actions in
**different domains**]{.mark}]{.underline} [([e.g. a
**cyberattack**]{.underline}]{.mark} [against]{.underline} [critical
infrastructure]{.underline}). Flexibility, good intelligence and
inventiveness in responding to such developments would be crucial.

Conflict termination

[Russian and NATO [assumptions regarding **conflict termination**
would]{.mark} most **likely [not survive the first hours]{.mark} of an
actual conflict**]{.underline}. [[Both sides are capable of
**underestimating**]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[resolve]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of the other side to prevail in a
conflict and the]{.underline} [other side's **willingness** to commit
the necessary resources and endure the costs,]{.underline} [[especially
once both]{.mark} sides **[start committing]{.mark} their [political
capital]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[resources]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline} the **[casualties
accumulate]{.underline}**.

With regards to Russia, Moscow would most likely be approaching the
conflict with a clearer concept of its war aims and thus develop
better-formed views on conflict termination. It would seek to establish
escalation dominance and confront NATO with a binary choice of either
accepting defeat or further intensification of fighting. Such
intensification might involve a move to the nuclear level, but Russia
would also have conventional escalation options, such as conventional
deep strikes.

At the same time, [it should be highlighted that [Russia is unlikely to
start a conflict which involves]{.mark} a high degree of
[uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline} about its final outcome [and carries a
risk of military defeat]{.underline}. Russia cannot safely assume that
US-led NATO would act with restraint, nor could it be sure that the
Alliance would be ready to surrender and terminate a conflict early. For
internal reasons Russia cannot afford to lose a "big war", so the most
prudent option would generally be not to initiate such a conflict in the
first place. [Such [logic]{.mark} [could]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[however]{.underline}**, [**[get lost]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [some of the **[hybrid
scenarios]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[and scenarios of [an
**inadvertent outbreak**]{.mark}]{.underline} [of a
conflict]{.underline}.

#### 2) TRADE-OFF\-\--prioritizing [acts of war]{.underline} [cannibalizes]{.underline} [focus]{.underline} AND [resources]{.underline} from broad-based [cyber resilience]{.underline} strategies that are more effective. 

Jason **Blessing 22**, Jeane Kirkpatrick Visiting Research Fellow at the
American Enterprise Institute, "The Russian Cyber Threat Is Here to Stay
and NATO Needs to Understand It," AEI, 4/25/22,
<https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-russian-cyber-threat-is-here-to-stay-and-nato-needs-to-understand-it/>

[Since the Russian invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine, the
[Biden]{.underline} administration has [escalated warnings
about]{.underline} likely [Russian cyber-attacks]{.underline} on
American infrastructure and business. [More worrying still]{.underline},
cyber alarmists like Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark
[Warner]{.underline}, D-Va., have [suggested]{.underline} that
[cyber-attacks from the Kremlin could be **acts of war that trigger
NATO's collective defense**]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline} **[sky-is-falling delusion]{.underline}**,
particularly from leaders with access to classified intelligence,
[is]{.underline} at best counterproductive and at worst
**[dangerous]{.underline}**.

[Cyber-attacks are]{.underline} **[rarely acts of war]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[treating]{.underline}** [them as if they **are**
**undermines** NATO's ability to deal with **real threats short of cyber
war**]{.underline}.

NATO has only invoked Article 5 -- which triggers a collective response
-- once and that was after the 9/11 attacks.

[Cyber-attacks are unlikely to]{.underline} **[destroy
buildings]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[kill
thousands]{.underline}** in an instant. [While collective defense
extends to cyberspace, **few operations**]{.underline}
[could]{.underline} **[realistically]{.underline}** be a
**[cause]{.underline}** for **[war]{.underline}**.

[This would include cyber-attacks resulting in]{.underline}
**[death]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[damage]{.underline}**
[like]{.underline} **[traditional military operations]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[coordinated assaults]{.underline}** [that take
the]{.underline} power **[grid]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[entire]{.underline}** economic **[sectors]{.underline}**
[offline]{.underline}. [These scenarios are]{.underline}
**[unlikely]{.underline}** though: [such attacks require]{.underline}
**[far too much time, funding, manpower, and control]{.underline}**.
Instead, **[most]{.underline}** [attacks **temporarily**]{.underline}
[overwhelm **servers**]{.underline} with traffic, [deny]{.underline}
[**network access**, hold **computers hostage**, and]{.underline}
**[steal]{.underline}** or delete **[data]{.underline}**.

[Even if allies]{.underline} **[wanted]{.underline}** [to trigger
Article 5]{.underline} over cyber operations, **[disagreements
about]{.underline}** the **[definitions]{.underline}** of threats,
**[origins]{.underline}** of attacks, [and]{.underline} **[pain
thresholds]{.underline}** in cyberspace [can]{.underline} **[derail the
process]{.underline}**.

**[Collective retaliation]{.underline}** [requires a]{.underline}
**[unanimous vote]{.underline}** across NATO; [building]{.underline}
**[unity]{.underline}** [across these points is]{.underline} **[nearly
impossible]{.underline}** [for most cyber activity]{.underline}. Unlike
missile attacks or tanks in the streets, **[few "red
lines"]{.underline}** [exist to distinguish cybercrime, cyber espionage,
and cyber disruption from **digital acts of war**]{.underline}.

[Beyond the]{.underline} **[bureaucratic and logistical
limitations]{.underline}** of elevating cyber to a casus belli,
[focusing on cyber-attacks as **acts of war**]{.underline}
**[distracts]{.underline}** [from the more]{.underline}
**[likely]{.underline}** [Russian]{.underline} digital
[assaults]{.underline} **[below]{.underline}** the level of [armed
conflict.]{.underline} [These include **ransomware**]{.underline}
attacks [and]{.underline} **[supply chain]{.underline}**
[infiltrations]{.underline} [that]{.underline} **[look]{.underline}**
like **[criminal]{.underline}** activity or espionage.

The Kremlin is particularly adept at the latter. In the SolarWinds
compromise, Russia hacked one company's software product to access
networks of Fortune 500 companies and U.S. government agencies.

**[Spillover]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} operations in [Ukraine
poses an]{.underline} **[additional]{.underline}** [risk]{.underline}.
The Russians have already deployed several digital tools to destroy
computer data, resulting in corrupted computers for Ukrainian companies
with government support roles. The same malicious software has also
affected several Latvian and Lithuanian businesses.

The danger is another situation like NotPetya in 2017, where malware
self-replicated, spread past Ukrainian targets to cripple networks in
over 150 countries, and created \$10 billion in damages.

Each of [these scenarios are]{.underline} **[much more
likely]{.underline}** [than]{.underline} a **["cyber
doomsday"]{.underline}** that would justify an Article 5 response from
NATO members.

To be fair, policymakers' fears of cyber war have led to some positive
developments for the alliance. For instance, over the last several
years, NATO has developed its own framework for combining cyber and
conventional military capabilities in warfighting. But allies remain
unprepared to deal with "death by 1000 cuts" in cyberspace.

[Concentrating only on **acts of war**]{.underline} [comes at
the]{.underline} **[expense]{.underline}** [of addressing
the]{.underline} **[cumulative costs]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
[**low-level cyber threats over time**. It leads to an]{.underline}
**[overreliance on]{.underline}** cyber **[deterrence]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[defensive whack-a-mole strategies,
neither]{.underline}** [of which are]{.underline}
**[sustainable]{.underline}**.

[**Threats of retaliation simply don't deter most cyber-attacks**, and
it is]{.underline} **[unrealistic]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[defensive]{.underline}** [measures to stop]{.underline} **[every
hacker]{.underline}**.

Policymakers across [NATO must]{.underline}
**[acknowledge]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} **[security failures
are the norm]{.underline}** in cyberspace, [and that the compounding
costs of failure over time are]{.underline} every bit as
**[dangerous]{.underline}** as the threat of cyber war.

[Building cyber]{.underline} **[resilience]{.underline}** [is
an]{.underline} **[important step]{.underline}** forward. It
acknowledges that, in many cases, the Russians will get the best of us
in cyberspace. The focus is on controlling failures to limit damage and
quickly get networks back online.

Moving from buzzword to actual strategy requires addressing several
questions. Which digital assets are most significant? Where is the
alliance most exposed to Russian cyber-attacks? Where should NATO reduce
operating risks, and in what areas can it assume more? How can allies
track long-term trends and adapt to new technologies?

[The Russian cyber threat is here to stay. Collective defense is -- and
should remain -- the cornerstone of NATO. But]{.underline} **[time is
running out for the alliance to protect itself from scenarios that
aren't all-out cyber war]{.underline}**.

#### 3) PERCEPTION\-\--ambiguity about NATO's role in sub-warfare engagements erodes the [intelligence norm]{.underline} in cyberspace, which [presumes]{.underline} that cyber penetrations are for [info gathering]{.underline} rather than achieving offensive effects. 

Jeppe T. **Jacobsen 21**, Ph.D. candidate at the Danish Institute for
International Studies and the Center for War Studies at the University
of Southern Denmark, worked as cyber coordinator at the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of Denmark where he coordinated Denmark's cyber
diplomacy, "Cyber Offense in NATO: Challenges and Opportunities,"
International Affairs, vol. 97, no. 3, 05/01/2021, pp. 703--720

[The question then arises: does the lack of capacity to
deter]{.underline} **[non-military hybrid cyber
activities]{.underline}** [suggest that it is time for NATO to
**renegotiate the scope and substance of its collective defence
clause?**]{.underline}65 When it comes to cyberspace, the next section
expresses scepticism about expanding NATO's role. It addresses the
escalation risk associated with having NATO, an organization that has
refocused its attention on a more traditional military threat, become a
more active player below the threshold of collective defence. It argues
that [a more]{.underline} **[active stance]{.underline}** **[outside
military confrontation]{.underline}** [risks **undermining the
intelligence norm**]{.underline} [that currently dominates in
cyberspace---a norm whereby state activity in foreign networks
is]{.underline} **[not considered escalatory]{.underline}**.

Escalation and the dominant intelligence norm

[The **large overlap**]{.underline} [between]{.underline}
**[intelligence collection]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[attack]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[cyber]{.underline}**space
[makes it]{.underline} [**difficult to send clear signals to
adversaries**, in terms of either]{.underline} [**capabilities or
intentions**. When a foreign entity is **moving around in a network**,
is it]{.underline} **[then about to start a military
operation?]{.underline}** [Is the activity]{.underline} part of a
**[reconnaissance]{.underline}** mission**[?]{.underline}** [Is
it]{.underline} political or economic **[espionage?]{.underline}** [Is
it]{.underline} **[active defence?]{.underline}** [The difficulty of
answering these questions has created]{.underline} much
**[nervousness]{.underline}** [among cyber-conflict
experts]{.underline}. Ben Buchanan, for example, has shown how
**[defensive hacking]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[intel]{.underline}**ligence-**[gathering]{.underline}** in cyberspace
[is]{.underline} **[easily misinterpreted]{.underline}**
[as]{.underline} **[aggressive]{.underline}** behaviour.66
[Why]{.underline}, then, [have we not experienced]{.underline}
**[serious misinterpretation and escalation in
cyberspace?]{.underline}**

[One way to explain this is through the existence and dominance of
a]{.underline} largely **[unspoken but widely accepted
norm]{.underline}**. For decades, [the predominant actors in cyberspace
have been **intelligence agencies**; and the norms that characterize
interactions between intelligence agencies are **not primarily concerned
with military concepts**]{.underline} [such as]{.underline} conflict
**[escalation and deterrence]{.underline}**.67 [In the world of
intelligence]{.underline} agencies, [success is]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** [about keeping a]{.underline}
**[distance]{.underline}** [between oneself and the adversary by
**signalling**]{.underline} one's intentions and capabilities. [It is
about being able to]{.underline} **[outmanoeuvre]{.underline}**
[adversaries in a space of]{.underline} **[constant
contact]{.underline}**.68 [There are]{.underline} [**always risks**, and
the work usually takes place in **legal grey zones**]{.underline} where
a clear distinction between war and peace is not the guiding principle.
This is an arena where the opportunity to annoy, cheat and delay
opponents is taken when it arises. In short, [espionage and
counter-espionage do **not fit well**]{.underline} [with
the]{.underline} **[thorough military operational
planning]{.underline}** [that characterizes NATO]{.underline}
operations. [Intelligence operations, on the other hand, **fit
perfectly**]{.underline} [with a]{.underline} **[dynamic
cyberspace]{.underline}** [where]{.underline} **[anonymity is
easy]{.underline}** to achieve [and]{.underline}
**[uncertainty]{.underline}** [a]{.underline} **[constant]{.underline}**
condition.69 [The states that embrace cyberspace as a domain where the
**intelligence norm**]{.underline} [dominates are able to use
a]{.underline} **[broader array of tools]{.underline}** [to pursue or
respond to various foreign political objectives than **only** those that
relate to **military** operations]{.underline}.

In its 2018 'vision', the US Cyber Command built implicitly on the
dominant intelligence norm. Here, the objective is to become more agile
and act as close to the adversary as possible ('defend forward').70 The
United States considers 'constant contact' and 'persistent engagement'
as the necessary guiding principles to achieve superiority in cyberspace
and to take full advantage of the broader potential for pursuing its
political objectives through cyberspace. During the 2018 US midterm
elections, for example, the US Cyber Command worked closely with the NSA
to disrupt servers operated by the Russian Internet Research Agency
aiming to spread fake news and stir up tension in the United States.71
More recently, the US Cyber Command responded with various cyber effects
against Iran after the Iranian Revolutionary Guards apparently placed
mines on ships in the Strait of Hormuz.72 These practices illustrate
that, for the United States, cyber effects provide political options
when one does not want to escalate existing tensions into military
confrontation. Defensive coordination between allies through CYOC
supports such defensive use of cyber effects, increasing the possibility
that US Cyber Command will be allowed to 'defend forward' and work
persistently through allied networks.73 [A more cyber-active
NATO]{.underline}, however, [risks being **counterproductive** to the
ambition to 'defend forward' through allied networks.]{.underline}

**[Unintended conflict escalation]{.underline}** [from ongoing cyber
activity is **mainly a risk if military analysts---in a strategic
environment with heightened attention to military confrontation---ignore
the dominant intelligence norm**. If that happens, it becomes more
likely that '**persistent engagement'**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[active]{.underline}** cyber **[defence]{.underline}** [will be
**misinterpreted as military preparation, armament or the initial phase
of**]{.underline} an [**attack**. If **NATO**]{.underline}, an
organization that has publicly returned to its original raison d'être of
deterrence and collective defence, [becomes the entity that coordinates
cyber effects below the threshold of armed conflict, then
the]{.underline} **[likelihood increases]{.underline}** [that
Russia]{.underline} **[misinterprets]{.underline}** [these effects
as]{.underline} **[escalatory]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[acts
accordingly]{.underline}**. In other words, [a]{.underline} **[more
active NATO]{.underline}** [in the current strategic environment
**increases the risk**]{.underline} [that the]{.underline} existing
**[intelligence norm]{.underline}** [will be]{.underline}
**[undermined]{.underline}** [and replaced by a]{.underline} more
**[militarized norm]{.underline}**.

This does not mean that states that face hostile hybrid activities below
the threshold of armed conflict will be left alone. Intelligence
cooperation between allied countries does exist, and threat information
is occasionally shared. In addition to the current political
collaboration facilitated by NATO to improve network security and
resilience, the EU is engaging in similar civilian activities, as well
as developing and implementing a cyber-diplomatic toolbox to create a
common basis for responding to a variety of malicious activities against
member states. Further strengthening the political partnership between
the EU and NATO is thus the most appropriate way forward to avoid
further militarization of cyberspace.

Sustaining the intelligence norm as the dominant norm is not without
potential problems. Openly embracing the fact that cyberspace is a
domain in which intelligence agencies are constrained only by domestic
laws, and where takedowns of servers in foreign countries are not
necessarily perceived as serious breaches of sovereignty, is likely to
lead to an increase in the exploitation of IT vulnerabilities in
commercial software used in both enemy and allied networks. For smaller
states, this could increase the risk of retaliation by larger
adversaries, and it could increase the risk of divisions between
allies---divisions that are not aligned with the United States'
political ambition to use cyber coordination in NATO as part of its
attempt to 'defend forward'.74 More exploitation could also ultimately
make cyberspace less free, less open and less secure, rendering civilian
populations more susceptible to cybercrime, surveillance and disruptions
of everyday services.75 This is why some states, NGOs and private
corporations such as Microsoft continue to promote norms that emphasize
restraint on the part of states' intelligence agencies and militaries in
cyberspace, and why other states promote more sovereign control of
cyberspace.76

Conclusion

This article has pointed to several challenges to the integration of
military cyber effects in NATO operations, and has argued that even if
the integration is successful, it will not add to the alliance's
deterrence posture. Importantly, the fact that CYOC does not send a
strong signal to adversaries such as Russia does not mean that it is a
waste of time. Far from it. As both conventional militaries and
paramilitary groups are increasingly dependent on civilian networked
technologies, the ability of NATO to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy
enemy networks through sovereign cyber effects---even if these amount
only to temporary annoyances---will become more relevant in the years to
come. This, of course, does not mean that conventional kinetic or
electromagnetic capabilities will become redundant. Rather, cyber
effects offer a substitute in case the intended target cannot be reached
with conventional capabilities, and a supplement that works alongside
conventional operations as persistent annoyances of enemy networked
devices. The latter, however, demands an agile CYOC that provides member
states with broad initial mandates and facilitates quick decision-making
and rapid approval when member states stand ready to deliver even minor
cyber annoyances.

Furthermore, the article has argued that [NATO]{.underline} and its CYOC
[should]{.underline} **[not seek to coordinate]{.underline}** additional
**[offensive cyber efforts]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [**deter
hybrid activities below the threshold of armed conflict**. If an
organization that is perceived by its]{.underline} **[main
adversary]{.underline}** **[primarily]{.underline}** [as]{.underline} a
**[military]{.underline}** organization [engages in]{.underline}
**[active cyber-defence]{.underline}** measures [and]{.underline}
**[persistent]{.underline}** cyber **[engagements]{.underline}**
**[outside]{.underline}** of [**military confrontation**, then the risk
of]{.underline} [**escalation increases**. This is because **every
potential NATO-initiated cyber activity in foreign
networks**]{.underline} [is likely to be]{.underline} **[perceived
through a military lens]{.underline}** [and thus]{.underline} to
[be]{.underline} (mis-)**[interpreted as an attack]{.underline}** in the
making. [In fact, active cyber-defence measures in foreign networks and
use of cyber means below the threshold of armed conflict to pursue
political interests internationally are part of our current reality.
**Intelligence** agencies **know this** to be a fact, and they live by
it every day]{.underline}.

[NATO has achieved **some strategic ambiguity**]{.underline} with its
current cyber policy, which may help to deter high-stakes Russian
assaults during the present crisis. [However, rather than an all-out
Russian cyberattack]{.underline}, a [far more **plausible**]{.underline}
scenario [is a **lower-level** attack carried out by the Russian
**government** or a **proxy group**]{.underline} [against]{.underline}
one or more [**allies**. In this case, the alliance's interests --- not
to mention transatlantic security --- would be better served by adopting
**nationally-tailored responses**]{.underline} rather than pulling the
Article 5 lever. Additionally, [to prevent **further
escalation**]{.underline} [and reinforce the implicit **firebreak** that

NATO allies should also agree to **restrict** any retaliatory response

[The **legal challenges**]{.underline} [that hybrid threats present for
collective security guarantees have been recognized]{.underline} at the
highest political level. [At their Warsaw summit held in July 2016,
[NATO]{.mark}'s member states [confirmed]{.mark}]{.underline} their
[readiness to assist each other at any stage of a hybrid campaign and to
counter hybrid warfare]{.underline} as part of collective defense.294
[They]{.underline} also [underscored]{.underline} that the
[[N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}tlantic [C]{.mark}ouncil "[could]{.mark}
decide to **[invoke Article 5]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the Washington
Treaty."295 They repeated these points at their Brussels summit in July
2018.296 [[By]{.mark} [drawing a]{.mark}n **express [link]{.mark}**
[between **hybrid war**]{.mark}**fare** [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[collective defense]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[NATO]{.mark} leaders
**[signaled]{.mark} their [resolve]{.mark}** []{.mark}not to allow
Article 5 to be **hollowed out**]{.underline}.297 [Still]{.underline},
[their declarations of **intent** strike a rather]{.underline}
**[conservative note.]{.underline}** Whilst they accept that NATO may
assist an Ally at any stage of a "hybrid campaign," it is only in cases
of "hybrid warfare" that they foresee a potential role for Article 5.
This is not an unreasonable position to take. As we saw earlier,
[recourse to the [use of force to counter]{.mark} [hybrid threats
falling **below**]{.mark} **the threshold of [an armed
attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is neither
**permissible**]{.underline}]{.mark} [n[or]{.mark}]{.underline}
necessarily **[[appropriate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [A [pledge to
invoke]{.mark} the mutual defense [commitment in response to
**every**]{.mark} **type of [hybrid threat]{.mark}** [would]{.mark} be a
promise to **[use the]{.mark} proverbial [sledgehammer to crack a
nut]{.mark}.** It [would be **unrealistic** and]{.mark} therefore
[**lack credibility**]{.mark} in the eyes of hybrid
**adversaries**]{.underline}.298 [By accepting that the role of Article
5 is **confined** to situations of hybrid warfare, the]{.underline}
[Warsaw and Brussels Summit Declarations]{.underline}
[avoid]{.underline} such **[empty gestures]{.underline}**.
[However]{.underline}, in the same breath [they also concede that the
application of Article 5 is contingent on]{.underline} [the legal
threshold between warfare and peace, and thus **vulnerable to
subversion**]{.underline} along the lines discussed in the preceding
sections.

[It may be tempting to deal with the problem of legal thresholds by
**attempting to escape them**]{.underline} [altogether]{.underline},
[but **this is not a feasible strategy**]{.underline}. [Even if the
contracting parties were to **revise Article 5** NAT]{.underline} and
Article 42(7) TEU [to avoid references to "armed attack" and "armed
aggression,"]{.underline}299 [they would remain bound by the rules
governing the use of force under the UN Charter and customary
international law]{.underline}. Although the member states of NATO and
the EU make up an influential part of the international community, it is
not within their ability to adjust these general rules of international
law unilaterally. In any event, [**[lowering the threshold for]{.mark}
the [use of force]{.mark}** in order [to **facilitate**]{.mark} **the
[application of Article 5]{.mark}**]{.underline} and Article 42(7)
[[would]{.mark} **come with significant costs**]{.underline}, [since it
would **[loosen]{.mark} the [legal restrictions for all
states,]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[including hostile
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The applicable thresholds therefore
**cannot be unilaterally modified at will**]{.underline} and [without
the [risk]{.mark} [of **unraveling**]{.mark} **key elements of [the
international legal order]{.mark}**]{.underline} as it currently stands.

[[A more **promising approach** is to **strengthen legal
interoperability**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[among
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and EU [nations]{.underline}. [One line of
effort is to **[reduce legal gray zones]{.mark}**]{.underline},300 for
example [[by **narrowing disagreements**]{.mark} over the gap that lies
between the definition of force and armed attack]{.underline}. [This
could prepare the ground for [develop]{.mark}ing [a]{.mark} **[shared
understanding]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of **what**]{.mark} **kind of
[hybrid threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[may trigger]{.mark} the
applicability of [Article 5]{.mark} NAT]{.underline} and Article 42(7)
TEU. Given that the assessment of any security threat depends heavily on
its context, it may prove somewhat sterile to build such a consensus in
the abstract. Drawing on war-gaming and exercises may offer a more
fruitful way forward. Bearing in mind how attractive the use of proxies
is to a hybrid state adversary,301 developing a common approach to
attribute their activities to the sponsoring state also merits
attention. Although many aspects of the rules governing the attribution
of wrongful acts are settled, certain questions could benefit from a
joint posture.302 NATO and EU nations should also strengthen their
collective mechanisms for unmasking attempts at plausible deniability in
order to deny its use as a hybrid instrument,303 as illustrated by their
united response to the Skripal incident and to Russian cyber
operations.304

Harvard National Security Journal Volume 10,
https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/02/Return-of-Gunboat-Diplomacy.pdf

This article explores how [the "West,"]{.underline} [the main creator of
modern international law]{.underline} after WWII, [is]{.underline} now,
nevertheless, **[steadily undermining it.]{.underline}** [While
purporting to be reemphasizing each state's right to defend itself and
elevating]{.underline} the protection of [human rights, [the West
is]{.mark},]{.underline} in truth, [[rendering]{.mark} the]{.underline}
far-reaching [[ban on]{.mark} the [use of force]{.mark} envisaged in the
U.N. Charter **[ineffective]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thereby [paving the
ground for a return to]{.underline} [19th century]{.underline}
**[gunboat diplomacy]{.underline}**.1 [This]{.underline} [new age of
international law is marked by the use of force [no longer]{.mark} being
[governed by]{.mark} the **[rule of law]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [but
rather almost exclusively by the raw power of states]{.underline}---a
fact western politicians attempt to conceal by issuing dubious, often
hypocritical, but wellsounding statements. These states have abandoned
the---perhaps utopian---goal of realizing the principle of sovereign
equality and are increasingly replacing it with an aggressively
hierarchical order of states reminiscent of the colonial era of the 19th
century.

Seemingly [disparate western forces are **eroding the ban on the use of
force**]{.underline}: [right-wing
interventionists]{.underline}---predominantly, but not exclusively---to
be found in the United States, [and]{.underline} [so-called
liberals]{.underline} spread across the West. [Common to both approaches
is the argument that international law is steadily and necessarily
**evolving to adapt to developments in the modern world**.]{.underline}

There are supposedly stark differences between right wing and liberal
approaches to international law. Right-wing interventionists tend to be
quite open about their disdain for international law, sometimes even
claiming that law does not and/or has never governed international
relations and that outcomes are ultimately the result of the involved
states' relative power.2 Others, such as Michael Glennon, do accept that
international law has a role to play in foreign affairs, but argue that
its rules should flexibly adjust to the major powers' relative
strength.3 Furthermore, right-wing interventionists tend to focus their
arguments on the rules governing the use of force while the liberals'
reforming zeal is generally broader.

The [liberal approach tends to emphasize its strict adherence to the
rule of law in international affairs. Liberals, however, often argue
that international law, especially customary international law, is
**evolving**]{.underline} under the influence of international human
rights law. It is no longer the state, but the individual human being
that is becoming and should become the focus of international law.4 This
has allegedly led to the emergence of a right to intervene abroad on
humanitarian grounds. More extreme advocates of the liberal strand of
thought have even justified interventions in order to install/reinstate
a "democratic" government. At this point, some liberal and right-wing
scholars have in fact found limited common ground, as this argument can
readily serve to justify the right-wing interventionists' general
"regime change" agenda in "rogue states."

This article will show both strands of thought to be similarly harmful
to the international rule of law. Both necessarily require the
acceptance of a hierarchy of states, based on their relative power, and
both rely on the United States' alleged exceptionalism as leader of the
Free World and the West's unparalleled strength following the Eastern
Bloc's collapse in the early 1990s. Since then, the widespread
assumption has been that only the United States and its close allies
could retain the capabilities to rely on more generous rules permitting
the use of force.

As we near the end of the second decade of the 21st century, this
**[[blasé attitude]{.underline}]{.mark}** towards the rest of the world
[has [turned]{.mark} [out]{.mark} to be [misplaced]{.mark}. Rather,
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline} as diverse as [**[Russia]{.underline}**,
**[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**]{.mark},
**[[Colombia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
**[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[have]{.underline}]{.mark}
[increasingly [come to rely on]{.mark} **ever-[expanding exceptions to
the ban on the use of force]{.mark}**]{.underline} [first advocated by
the West]{.underline}. [Consequently, we are [witnessing]{.mark} a
**[return to gunboat diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[states that
feel powerful]{.mark} enough [to intervene]{.mark}]{.underline}
forcefully [[in another state's]{.mark} internal [affairs will]{.mark}
do so and **[claim justification]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[based
on]{.mark} the often **[ill-defined]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[ill-advised [rules]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline} right-wing interventionists and [liberals have tried
to impose]{.underline}. [The rule of law is thus again
being]{.underline} **[replaced]{.underline}** [by the Darwinian
principle of the "survival of the fittest]{.underline}." Meanwhile, [we
are steadily approaching the point]{.underline} Glennon claims we have
already passed,5 [whereby]{.underline} the [[jus ad
bellum]{.underline}]{.mark} [has [become]{.mark}
**[indeterminate]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [meaning]{.underline} that
**[[few]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[if any]{.underline}**, [[constraining
rules]{.mark} on the use of force [remain]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Recent developments illustrate this: the United States did not even
bother to put forward a serious legal argument to justify its attacks on
Syrian forces]{.underline} in 2017 and 2018 in retaliation for their
alleged use of chemical weapons. The [frequent [recourse to]{.mark}
[force **irrespective of i**]{.mark}**nternational
[law]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as practiced by western and]{.underline},
[increasingly, other states has [led to]{.mark} a widespread **[increase
in spending on]{.mark} defensive and [offensive
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [States wish to protect both their
sovereignty and standing in the new hierarchy of states,]{.underline}
and many of them have presumably come to the same conclusion as India
already had in 2003, following the United States' and the U.K.'s
unlawful attack on Iraq: disagreement with the United States requires
the possession of nuclear weapons.6

The article will focus on the two areas of the law on the use of force
where the effect of western thought has contributed to the serious
weakening of legal structures. First, I will examine the erosion of the
law on self-defense in some detail, before subsequently turning to the
attempts to justify the use of force in other cases, notably during
humanitarian crises. I will first outline the arguments in support of an
expansive view of the right to resort to force before assessing them
according to the U.N. Charter, the jurisprudence of the International
Court of Justice (hereinafter ICJ) and traditional customary
international law. This will be followed by an exposé of state practice
and opinio juris. Finally, a brief conclusion will summarize the current
state of affairs.

This analysis will demonstrate that [successive attempts at
"modernizing" international law are in danger of]{.underline}
[**dismantling the safeguards against war** and of recreating a world in
which a few privileged states can attempt to impose]{.underline} [their
will on the rest.]{.underline} The logic of an ever-expanding concept of
justified military action selfevidently reveals a hierarchal view of the
international community: only the wealthy and privileged western states
and their close allies should benefit from such generous rules. [It [was
never in the West's interest that]{.mark} other states, such as [Russia,
**China**]{.mark}, or India [should invoke an **expansive view**]{.mark}
[of the right to use force]{.mark}. **[However]{.mark}**, as recent
developments illustrate, [the West]{.mark} has
**[miscalculated]{.mark}**; its power is no longer sufficient to stop
other states from **exploiting its dubious precedents.**]{.underline}

order]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} [Given the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [conventional military
superiority and the severe risks associated with regional war,
competitors such as Russia and China---who desire to challenge U.S.
predominance but remain determined to avoid large-scale conflict if
possible]{.underline}---[are adopting tactics that undermine U.S.
interests but that makes conventional military responses
infeasible.]{.underline} By relying largely on non-military capabilities
and operating in what has been called a "gray zone," these competitors
confront the United States and its allies with a series of policy and
strategy challenges. Thus far, the United States and regional actors
have arguably yet to form a coherent policy to address the challenges.

This short policy paper seeks to provide an overview of the challenge
posed by gray zone coercion in Asia and propose some principles that
should guide the U.S., its allies and partners in countering the threat.

The Gray Zone Challenge in Asia

China's use of maritime law enforcement and maritime militia to assert
administrative control over disputed territory and waters in the East
and South China Sea, as well as island-building activities in the South
China Sea, have introduced a new doctrine of maritime coercion in Asia.
This doctrine puts a premium on non-military assets and subterfuge that
puts the onus of military escalation on the recipient of such tactics.
China appears to calculate that relying on non-military assets such as
coast guard vessels, maritime militia and other civilian maritime
actors, while keeping PLA Navy (PLAN) surface ships largely in the
background, will enable it to achieve its strategic goals while
minimizing the risk of further escalation. Starting in 2014, China also
initiated one of the most ambitious island-building campaigns in history
-- reclaiming over 3,000 acres of land on disputed features in the
Paracel and Spratly Island chain -- and building civil-military
facilities on them. Several of these features now have large airstrips,
hangers, radar facilities and military barracks to support military
deployments in the naval and air domain. The scale and rapidity with
which China achieved these island-building projects was unprecedented
and caught the United States, its allies and partners off guard.

By using such tools, platforms and tactics, [China has greatly improved
its position and administrative control over much of the disputed
territory in the]{.underline} [East and South China Sea, and done so at
minimal material or diplomatic cost.]{.underline} China has also been
successful at "civilianizing" the optics of the threat, ensuring that if
one of its rivals responds with military assets, such as with its Navy
or Air Force, that country will appear to be the party engaging in
escalatory behavior, rather than China. Moreover, especially in the case
of much weaker rivals like the Philippines, employing naval assets in
reaction to provocative Chinese maritime law enforcement or other
non-military activities risks creating an opportunity for China to
respond in kind, thus escalating the conflict to a level where it enjoys
even more overwhelming superiority.

Chinese Gray zone tactics differ in several ways. In East Asia,
[[territorial disputes]{.mark} between China and Japan over the Senkaku
Islands have brought about a significant escalation of tensions over the
past several years]{.underline}, yet [China has not adopted the types of
escalatory tactics or maneuvers that [might lead to escalation]{.mark}
seen in the]{.underline} [S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea. [China's use of coast guard and maritime militia to
change the status of Japan's administrative control over the Senkakus
nonetheless poses new gray zone challenges in the maritime and air
domains in Japan's southwest island chain.]{.underline} Since 2012,
China has undertaken near-constant incursions into the Senkaku
territorial seas test Japan's will and resolve to respond. In
particular, the recent deployment of armed Chinese coast guard cutters
-- many of which are decommissioned PLA Navy frigates; and the use of
maritime militia fisherman whose vessels are equipped with intelligence
gathering capabilities and whose personnel are under the command and
control of the Navy -- has injected another layer of gray zone challenge
for Japan. These moves are calibrated to gauge the timeliness and
readiness of the Japanese Coast Guard (JCG) to respond and compel the
JCG to maintain continuous presence around the islands. For the most
part, however, they follow a predictable pattern of behavior of
incursions.

[[In Southeast Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, [[Chinese
gray zone tactics]{.mark} inhabit a more materially-threating form and
countries in the region have grown increasingly wary of Chinese efforts
to deter or in some cases actively [deny the use of living and
non-living resources in their]{.mark} exclusive economic zone
([EEZs]{.mark}) of the]{.underline} [S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea. To do so, China now actively
deploys coast guard and maritime militia to protect the waters and
territory within its Nine-Dash Line (NDL) claim, which has been
invalidated under international law. In contrast to China's approach
near the Senkakus in the East China Sea, [[China adopts a much more
aggressive posture]{.mark} in the]{.underline} [S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, in part due to Beijing's
calculation that is can coerce smaller Southeast Asian countries who in
most cases do not counter-deter. The way in which China employs its
coast guard, in particular, has upended conventional wisdom on the
tactics of how coast guards operate. China's coast guard is acting as a
"blunt defenders of sovereignty" undertaking actions such as ramming
other states' coast guard and fishing vessels, rather than acting as
traditional instruments of law enforcement. [[The use of its coast
guard]{.mark} [as an]{.mark} [instrument to protect claimed territory
while conducting peacetime patrols]{.mark} of disputed maritime
territory [has blurred the line between]{.mark} the platforms and
missions associated with "[law enforcement"]{.mark} [and]{.mark} those
associated with ["national defense."]{.mark}]{.underline} In one of the
most sweeping rulings on the actions of maritime law enforcement in
disputed waters on legal record, the international tribunal found that
China's coast guard had breached several UNCLOS articles governing
safety and navigation at sea, striking down China's claim that it had
acted in a legal and professional manner.

on its borders as up to two million Syrians fleeing Assad's rule are
left with nowhere else to go, and Turkish forces have entered Idlib to
stop the offensive. [Now, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is
**mulling over**]{.mark} **its [response]{.mark}** [to the **escalating
tensions**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

The fresh concerns about America's role in the region come on the heels
of an airstrike by either Russian or pro-Assad forces, which killed two
Turkish soldiers during a rebel counter-offensive east of Idlib on
Thursday. In response, the Turkish military has reportedly asked the
United States to deploy anti-aircraft missiles and launch air patrols in
Turkey in order to deter Russia.

"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization \[[[NATO]{.underline}\] [has
**never seen** fighting of]{.underline} **[this intensity]{.underline}**
[this close to the border of a **member state**]{.underline}]{.mark},"
said Amb. Robert Ford, the last U.S. ambassador to Syria, at a Thursday
press conference at the U.S. Capitol.

The prospect of a NATO intervention in Syria has exposed fault lines
between the State Department and the Defense Department over the U.S.
mission in Syria. The State Department has been Turkey's closest
remaining ally in Washington after the Turkish military began using
Russian anti-aircraft missiles and attacked U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led
forces in northeastern Syria.

But the U.S.-led "military coalition is focused on defeating ISIS in the
eastern part of Syria," Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent
Resolve spokesman Col. Myles Caggins said in a Sky News interview on
Wednesday. Caggins referred to Idlib as a "magnet for terrorist groups"
who are "a nuisance, a menace and a threat to civilians."

"We continue to call on pro-regime forces to halt the offensive and
allow for humanitarian efforts in the area," he added in a later
statement.

The U.S. military had earlier called for de-escalation.

"We\'re seeing the Russians and the Turks have come very close to having
more extensive conflict in the area. We\'re hopeful that they will find
a solution to avoid that," said Department of Defense spokesman Jonathan
Hoffman on Wednesday. "There needs to be a political settlement in Syria
that will be for the best interests of the Syrian people."

The State Department has signaled stronger support for Turkey and the
Turkish-backed rebels in Idlib since Assad began his offensive in early
February.

"We stand by our NATO Ally Turkey . . . and fully support Turkey's
justified self-defense actions," declared Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
after pro-Assad forces killed several Turkish peacekeepers in Idlib on
February 2.

Amb. James Jeffrey, the State Department official overseeing Syrian
affairs, was in Turkey on February 11, as clashes erupted in Idlib
between Turkish and pro-Assad forces, killing five Turkish troops.

"Today, in Idlib, our ally Turkey\'s soldiers are facing a threat,"
Jeffrey declared in Turkish. "We have martyrs on the ground."

Jeffrey told Turkish television two days later that Russia, Iran, and
Assad will come to the table once they "see that they're not going to
make any more \[military\] progress without coming into conflict with us
. . . or the Israeli Air Force or Turkey."

Additionally, two former State Department officials called for the
United States to back Turkey against Russia at a Thursday press
conference at the U.S. Capitol.

Wa'el Alzayat, who served under both Ford and Jeffrey, emphasized that
Assad's record of atrocities "makes whatever ISIS did pale in
comparison."

He [called for]{.underline} "urgent action to provide political and
material support to Turkish forces today who are currently serving as a
last line of defense, [urgent action for NATO to signal to Russia that
what is happening on its border is unacceptable, and we'll **defend an
ally."**]{.underline}

"I think it is important that the government of the United States,
governments in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, meet with Turkish
officials to discuss how one could establish a safe zone for Syrian
civilians on the Syrian side of the Syrian-Turkish border," Ford himself
said. "[[The Turks]{.mark} can help with the safe zone from inside
Turkey, but [because they're facing Russia]{.mark}, they [will need help
from the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates."]{.underline}

Ford emphasized to the National Interest that he is not calling for U.S.
forces to deploy in Syria itself, adding that [[a U.S. incursion]{.mark}
into Idlib with "combat air patrols" [could mean a "**World War III
scenario."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[U.S. forces are **already**]{.mark} **[deployed]{.mark}** [to
northeastern Syria]{.mark} alongside Kurdish-led counterterrorism
forces. They reportedly killed a local man during a clash with a
pro-Assad militia on February 12, and nearly ran a Russian military
vehicle off the road in a confrontation on Wednesday.]{.underline}

#### Failure to cooperatively apply international norms to cyber weapons allows proliferating information warfare 

Justin **Lynch 19**, Associate Editor at Fifth Domain, has written for
the New Yorker, the Associated Press, Foreign Policy, the Atlantic,
1/24/19, "Why cyberwar is contributing to a potential doomsday,"
https://www.fifthdomain.com/thought-leadership/2019/01/25/why-cyberwar-is-contributing-to-a-potential-doomsday/

[A wave of new [cyberattacks and]{.mark} an increase in
**[info]{.mark}rmation [war]{.mark}fare tactics** are helping to [create
an **existential threat** ]{.mark}**to humanity**, according to the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]{.underline}, who said in their annual
report that [its Doomsday Clock "is **two minutes to
midnight**]{.underline}."

The group of top researchers, scientists and thinkers warned Jan. 24
that [the world is in a "new abnormal" state of crisis that is
comparable when the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[pursued the hydrogen bomb in 1952]{.underline}. Since 1947, [the
Bulletin]{.underline} of the Atomic Scientists [has released a report
that uses the clock as an indicator of **how close the world is to an
existential threat to humanity**, or midnight]{.underline}.

[As institutions and government agencies face a proliferation of
hacking]{.underline} ― [attacks that]{.underline} often [**undercut
humanity's trust** in those organizations]{.underline} ― [the new fears
fuel the state of crisis, said Herb Lin, senior research scholar for
cyber policy and security at Stanford]{.underline} University and
contributor to the report.

"The [lack of cybersecurity]{.underline} for your systems is dangerous
because it [reduces confidence in the infrastructure]{.underline}," Lin
told Fifth Domain. He gave an example of how [fears of election hacking
can undermine voting confidence]{.underline}.

Officials from the Department of Homeland Security shared a similar
sentiment during the mid-term election season. While the elections went
off without acknowledgement of such an incident occurring, Lin cited it
as an example of how "the lack of cybersecurity is reducing confidence
in democracy."

He described the threat as an "insidious use of cyber technology and
cyber tools to target and exploit weaknesses in human cognition and
thinking.\"

In its annual report, the group warned that "[[rather than]{.mark} a
[cyber Armageddon that causes]{.mark} financial meltdown or nationwide
electrical [blackouts," a **larger** risk is]{.mark} the use of
**[cyber-enabled info]{.mark}rmation [warfare]{.mark}** [that
erodes]{.mark} "the [trust and cohesion on which]{.mark} civilized
[societies rely]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Evidence shows, however, that such disinformation campaigns occurred
during the 2018 midterm elections.

"Russia, and other foreign countries, including China and Iran,
conducted influence activities and messaging campaigns targeted at the
United States to promote their strategic interests," Director of
National Intelligence Dan Coats said in a review of the mid-term
election's security.

[[To stem the tide of cyber and **info**]{.mark}rmation [warfare, the
Bulletin]{.mark}]{.underline} of the Atomic Scientists [[suggested a
**collaborative approach**]{.mark} between countries]{.underline}.

"[[The international community should begin]{.mark} multilateral
[discussions]{.mark} that aim [to discourage cyber-enabled
**info**]{.mark}rmation [warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}," the group said
in its annual report.

[However, rallying major powers around an agreed upon set of norms has
so far been unsuccessful in cyberspace]{.underline}. The prospects for
future cohesion appear to be slim.

#### Information warfare's the [most dangerous]{.underline} existential threat humanity has [ever faced]{.underline}\-\--massive threat multiplier 

John **Mecklin 20**, Editor, Science and Security Board, Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists, 1/23/20, "Closer than ever: It is 100 seconds to
midnight," https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/

[**To:** Leaders and citizens of the world]{.underline}

**[Re:]{.underline}** **[[Closer than ever]{.underline}]{.mark}**:
**[[It is 100 seconds to midnight]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[Date:]{.underline}** [January 23, 2020]{.underline}

[Humanity continues]{.underline} to face two simultaneous
**[[existential dangers]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[[nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and **climate
change**]{.underline}]{.mark}---that [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[compounded]{.underline}** [by a **threat
multiplier**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [cyber-enabled
**[info]{.mark}**rmation **[war]{.mark}**fare]{.underline}, [[that
**undercuts**]{.mark} **society's [ability to
respond]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The international security situation is
dire, not just because these threats exist, but because world leaders
have allowed the international political infrastructure for managing
them to erode.

In the nuclear realm, national leaders have ended or undermined several
major arms control treaties and negotiations during the last year,
creating an environment conducive to a renewed nuclear arms race, to the
proliferation of nuclear weapons, and to lowered barriers to nuclear
war. Political [conflicts regarding nuclear programs]{.underline} in
[**[Iran]{.underline}** [and **No**]{.underline}]{.mark}[rth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea [remain unresolved]{.mark}]{.underline} and are, if
anything, worsening. [US-Russia coop]{.underline}eration [on [arms
control]{.mark}]{.underline} and disarmament [[is]{.mark} **all but
n[onexistent]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Public awareness of the climate crisis grew over the course of 2019,
largely because of mass protests by young people around the world. Just
the same, governmental action on climate change still falls far short of
meeting the challenge at hand. At UN climate meetings last year,
national delegates made fine speeches but put forward few concrete plans
to further limit the carbon dioxide emissions that are disrupting
Earth's climate. This limited political response came during a year when
the effects of manmade climate change were manifested by one of the
warmest years on record, extensive wildfires, and quicker-than-expected
melting of glacial ice.

[**Continued [corruption]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the
**[info]{.mark}**rmation ecosphere on which **democracy** and **public
decision making** depend has [heightened]{.mark} the **nuclear** and
**climate** [threats]{.mark}. In the last year, many governments used
cyber-enabled disinformation campaigns to sow distrust in institutions
and among nations, [undermining]{.mark} **domestic** and
**international** [efforts to]{.mark} foster peace and [protect the
planet]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This situation---two major threats to human civilization, amplified by
sophisticated, technology-propelled propaganda---would be serious enough
if leaders around the world were focused on managing the danger and
reducing the risk of catastrophe. Instead, over the last two years, we
have seen influential leaders denigrate and discard the most effective
methods for addressing complex threats---international agreements with
strong verification regimes---in favor of their own narrow interests and
domestic political gain. By [[undermining
**coop**]{.mark}erative]{.underline}, science- and law-based [approaches
to managing the most urgent threats to humanity, these leaders have
helped to create a situation that [will]{.mark}, if unaddressed, [lead
to catastrophe, **sooner rather than later**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Faced with this daunting threat landscape and a new willingness of
political leaders to reject the negotiations and institutions that can
protect civilization over the long term, the Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists Science and Security Board today moves the Doomsday Clock 20
seconds closer to midnight---closer to apocalypse than ever. In so
doing, board members are explicitly warning leaders and citizens around
the world that the international security situation is now more
dangerous than it has ever been, even at the height of the Cold War.

[**[Civilization-ending nuc]{.mark}**lear
**[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}---whether [started [by **design**,
**blunder**, or]{.mark}]{.underline} simple
**[[miscommunication]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[is a **genuine
possibility**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Climate change that could devastate
the planet is undeniably happening. And for a variety of reasons that
include a corrupted and manipulated media environment, democratic
governments and other institutions that should be working to address
these threats have failed to rise to the challenge.

The Bulletin believes that human beings can manage the dangers posed by
the technology that humans create. Indeed, in the 1990s leaders in the
United States and the Soviet Union took bold actions that made nuclear
war markedly less likely---and as a result the Bulletin moved the minute
hand of the Doomsday Clock the farthest it has been from midnight.

### Plan

#### The United States federal government should increase its security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to clarify the conditions under which Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty can be activated in response to cyber threats. 

### Solvency

#### Internal clarification of article V is key

David H. **Ucko 10**, adjunct fellow at the Department of War Studies,
King\'s College London\"Resetting Article 5: Toward a New Understanding
of NATO\'s Security Guarantees\", World Politics Review,
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/6838/resetting-article-5-toward-a-new-understanding-of-natos-security-guarantees

For all this, [the [alliance]{.mark} badly [needs]{.mark} a
[**clarification** of]{.mark} its [collective security
mech]{.mark}anism, for, though its current **[ambiguity may fool]{.mark}
prospective [adversaries, it]{.mark} really [should not fool NATO
itself]{.mark}.** There is a need]{.underline}, in other words, [to
chart a **middle path** between traditionalists and revolutionaries,
whereby NATO **maintains a solidarity** clause but comes to a new,
**narrower** and shared understanding of its meaning and implications.
The point would be to [downgrade]{.mark} the [expectations]{.mark} that
come with NATO membership [by **talking more honestly**]{.mark},
**[within NATO]{.mark}**, [about what the alliance is]{.mark}
[**likely** and **able** to commit to.]{.mark}]{.underline}

First, [it would be necessary to convey, **in private**, to members that
**an Article 5 response** is not automatic, but is rather the product of
intensely **political processes** within each NATO state, and that even
if a response is forthcoming, there is no way of guaranteeing that it
will be timely or particularly effective. The language of an
**unflinching**, **immediate**, collective and effective response may be
appropriate for **audiences outside of NATO**, but not for **internal
discussion.** Within the alliance, **[less grandstanding]{.mark}
rhetoric** [and **greater transparency** would]{.mark} [reduce]{.mark}
the scope for [**obfuscation**. The **language of collective security**
would **remain**]{.mark} \-- for symbolic reasons, **[for the deterrent
role]{.mark}** that Article 5 still plays and for the foundation it
provides for retaliatory action. But the point would be to
**re-emphasize** within the alliance the oft-forgotten provision of
Article 5 whereby each member takes only **\"such action as it deems
necessary\"** when fulfilling its security obligations.]{.underline}

Second, [[NATO would]{.mark} need to **[delineate]{.mark}** much more
clearly [**what types of threats** it is capable of countering]{.mark}.
No doubt [a **nontraditional attack** can be]{.mark} as
[devastating]{.mark} as a military strike, but it does not follow that
NATO is equally prepared to handle both. The decision regarding NATO\'s
role in any incident must be based not only on the severity of a
potential attack, but also on **NATO\'s ability** to mount an effective
response.]{.underline} Whereas the language of solidarity following the
Sept. 11 attacks was certainly appropriate, a case can be made that NATO
ultimately overextended itself in invoking Article 5. The invocation
established a dangerous precedent for the kinds of threats that the
article might cover, many of which NATO lacks the expertise to deter, to
forestall or to counter. [[Talking loudly]{.mark} about collective
defense against non-traditional attacks **[without]{.mark} a concomitant
[ability to deliver]{.mark}** when they occur [is likely to provoke a
**crisis of credibility**]{.mark} for the alliance.]{.underline}

[Similar [**gaps between expectations and capabilities**
surround]{.mark} the issue of **[cybersecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline},
which Secretary-General Rasmussen recently suggested should be covered
by Article 5, as well as [**energy-security threats** and **economic
warfare**: NATO undoubtedly has a role to play in protecting its members
from these potentially very harmful forms of attack, yet until the
capability is created, it may want to **interpret** its **security
guarantees** more **narrowly**. This also raises the question of [how
serious an attack in a **nontraditional domain**]{.mark} [would need to
be to **trigger Article 5**]{.mark} considerations. Some informal
[**criteria** would]{.mark} need to [be agreed upon]{.mark} to inform
expectation, yet clearly this is also something that would need to be
settled [**behind closed doors**,]{.mark} so as not to invite attack and
provocation **under the established threshold** or precisely where
NATO\'s guarantees are the weakest.]{.underline}

Naturally, the prospect of agreeing within NATO to a more honest but
weaker Article 5 regime will elicit much support among those who rely
most on NATO\'s security guarantees. Nonetheless, [**greater
[transparency is preferable to false hope]{.mark}**. A hardnosed
**stocktaking** of what NATO can and cannot do would also provide for a
more promising foundation on which progress could be made: a **common
appraisal** of problems faced and a **framework for finding limited
solutions**, where possible. This would also [allow]{.mark} those
[nations that feel]{.mark} most [vulnerable to **make their own security
arrangements**]{.mark}, even if that means seeking relationships outside
the alliance structure]{.underline}. In the event that such arrangements
are inimical to NATO\'s interests, the onus would then be on the
alliance itself to provide a preferable alternative. In that sense,
[**greater transparency** would make the self-interest of individual
members the foundation of NATO\'s collective defense mechanism, rather
than the need to ensure the alliance\'s solidarity or prove its
relevance, the reasons most often used to justify Article 5 security
guarantees today but whose rhetorical appeal rarely translates into
action.]{.underline}

[Upholding a security regime that is limited, patchy and short on
substance is far from ideal, yet it would **accurately** reflect the
alliance\'s current **intentions**, **capabilities** and **political
will**. So long as both those making the promise of collective defense
and those hoping to take it up are **mutually aware of its true
possibilities and very real limitations**, it may be the **least-bad**
and most-viable way out of an **awkward situation.**]{.underline}

#### Internal honesty exerts pressure on allies to fill capability gaps 

Łukasz **Kulesa 19**, Łukasz Kulesa is the deputy head of research at
the Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM), "The Future of
Deterrence: Effectiveness and Limitations of Conventional and Nuclear
Postures," Carnegie Europe, 11/28/19,
https://carnegieeurope.eu/2019/11/28/future-of-deterrence-effectiveness-and-limitations-of-conventional-and-nuclear-postures-pub-80440

Two [recent events have forced the alliance to **tailor
deterrence**]{.underline} to specific actors. [The first was Moscow's
aggression toward Ukraine]{.underline} from 2014 onward, along with its
military exercises that rehearsed a war with NATO. The second was the
deterioration of the situation in the Middle East and North Africa:
civil wars in Syria and Libya and the emergence of the self-proclaimed
Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which helped spawn the 2015 migration
crisis. Since then, Russia has remained the focus of NATO's deterrence,
but a reflection is under way on how to best deter nonstate and state
threats from the Middle East and North Africa.

[Going forward, NATO will need to consider three dimensions of
deterrence: **who**, **what**, and]{.underline} **[how]{.underline}**.
First, the alliance knows that it may be called on to deter other actors
in addition to Russia, but it needs to spell out which ones, because
each requires a different mix of means and strategies. Second, [NATO
needs to consider **what types of action**]{.underline}, **[beyond armed
attacks,]{.underline}** [it needs to deter]{.underline}. [This applies
to the full spectrum of threats, including those from
Russia.]{.underline} And third, [the allies have to constantly
**review** the]{.underline} **[effectiveness]{.underline}** [of their
current deterrence approaches]{.underline} in all areas of focus, [as
modern conflict has come to be dominated by
**unconventional**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[hybrid]{.underline}** [tactics]{.underline} used by state and
nonstate actors.

ISSUES AT STAKE

THE WHO

On NATO's Eastern flank, the focus is on Russia. Moscow seeks to achieve
its strategic aims---a sphere of influence in the neighborhood and the
prevention of NATO's expansion---without a war but seems ready to engage
in brinkmanship and is working on creating favorable conditions to
prevail in a conflict. This makes it necessary for the allies to develop
a credible deterrence strategy.

However, NATO also has to deter the threats from states and nonstate
entities in the Middle East and North Africa. The effects of conflicts
in the region are already being felt on NATO territory, and governments
in the most affected member states are asking how they can prevent
further spillover of existing and potential crises. The discussions have
been light on specifics, though not for lack of options. The allies are
already fielding missile defenses in Turkey to defend against missile
attacks from Syria; deterring conventional attacks on NATO territory
could be the next step, depending on developments in Syria itself. Other
actors of concern include Iran, with its growing missile arsenal, and
nonstate groups operating in Lebanon, Libya, and Syria.

Farther afield, given the U.S. and other allies' engagement in the Asia
Pacific and NATO's close links with Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and
South Korea, the alliance may have to consider the feasibility of
deterring China and North Korea from threatening or harming member
states. This would be a new task with significant resource implications
and should not be undertaken lightly.

THE WHAT

[**[Internally]{.underline}**, [NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[members]{.mark} [need]{.mark} [to be **clear**]{.mark} [about]{.mark}
**specific [actions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[they can]{.mark}
**reasonably [expect the alliance to deter]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Clearly, an armed attack---from whatever direction---is one course of
action to be deterred, but other actions are not so simple.1

[In the case of Russia]{.underline} (and other state actors), [the focus
is also on deterring **coercion**]{.underline}: the act of adversaries
imposing their will on NATO allies [through a combination of military
threats and nonmilitary means.]{.underline} [For now, the thinking at
NATO has emphasized deterrence of a territorial grab or blockade in the
Baltic region. However, the characteristics of the Russian **approach to
warfare**]{.underline} [mean that the alliance has to look **beyond the
Baltic Sea**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[beyond the physical
domain,]{.underline}** [mainly to the **cyber realm**]{.underline}.2
More and more of the critical systems running hospitals, carrying
electricity, or patrolling the skies are now connected to the internet
and therefore vulnerable. NATO's adversaries can, in theory, block
allied governments from coming to each other's aid by threatening
devastating cyber attacks that will cause populations to panic and
cripple economies.

[[NATO]{.mark} has already [declared]{.mark} that a [cyber attack
**could**]{.mark} lead the alliance to [invoke]{.mark}]{.underline} its
**[[Article 5]{.underline}]{.mark}** collective defense clause, [a
[statement]{.mark} that [**aims** to]{.mark}]{.underline} [have a
**[deter]{.mark}rent effect**]{.underline}---[[though there is **little
ev**]{.mark}**idence** that [it has **stopped adversaries from
trying**]{.mark}.3 This is mainly [because]{.mark} most [cyber attacks
are **designed** to **stay below the level** that would **trigger a
response**]{.mark} of the whole alliance. [The allies need a **clearer
policy** on **what to do** if the **line is
crossed**]{.mark}]{.underline} one day. That policy must also address
the thorny issue of credible attribution and should be rehearsed
rigorously.

THE HOW

NATO does not need to mirror the activities of its adversaries to deter
effectively. The idea is to signal that the alliance will not be
intimidated or coerced, but that can be done in multiple ways.

With regard to Russia and the threat of a land incursion, NATO has
decided to rely on limited forward deployments along its Eastern flank
and on the ability to reinforce quickly those small contingents in times
of crisis. The shortcoming of this posture is that if Russia overwhelms
the first line of defense, it may be able to use the strength of its
conventional forces, as well as the threat of nuclear weapon use, to
thwart allied reinforcement.

NATO, as a whole, is adapting its posture to respond, and the United
States is strengthening its military presence in Europe to address these
potential weak points. The mix of U.S. troops and stored equipment and
supplies in Europe is being expanded, including in Poland. And NATO has
taken steps to improve its ability to deploy units from North America
and move them around Europe by creating a Joint Force Command for the
Atlantic and a Joint Support and Enabling Command. Other means of
strengthening deterrence include implicit or explicit threats of
political or economic sanctions or threats of countermeasures in
cyberspace.

Regarding the South, the exact form of deterrence has to match the
threat that NATO chooses to deter. With regard to potential state
adversaries, NATO's existing deterrence tools and military capabilities
can be utilized against threats from that direction. The creation of the
Strategic Direction South Hub---a consultation and coordination body for
allies and partners---at the NATO command in Naples, Italy, also
contributes to the deterrence mission. However, these measures alone
will not deter the main challenge in the South: terrorist groups, with
the potential to strike in Europe, operate in lawless spaces.

RECOMMENDATIONS

NATO may be back to its traditional mission of deterrence, but
deterrence itself has evolved. [A **new approach** must be **adapted**
to **today's environment**]{.underline}, in which a number of deterrence
challenges need to be tackled simultaneously and sophisticated
nonconventional means can be used jointly with traditional military
tools to test the alliance.

**[MAINTAIN ALLIANCE COHESION]{.underline}**

While the allies' initial response to deterrence challenges has been
impressive, in the long run, **[deterrence fatigue]{.underline}** [may
present problems]{.underline}. [NATO needs to **keep all allies
committed**]{.underline} to the deterrence mission and continue to
secure sufficient contributions of committed forces, capabilities, and
resources. [The [risk]{.mark} is that [allies' **unity** and
**cohesion**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[the]{.underline} indispensable
**[foundations]{.underline}** [of
NATO]{.underline}---[[will]{.underline} **[weaken]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} memories of the Islamic State's caliphate and
of Russia's aggression against Ukraine fade.
[[Adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} will do their part to
**[sow]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[[exploit]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[divisions]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[or]{.underline} **[doubts]{.underline}** about the strength of
solidarity among alliance members.

[To keep cohesion from fraying, **[NATO's
leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[should]{.underline}]{.mark}
continuously **[[engage]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[every ally in
**dialogue**]{.underline} [about]{.underline}]{.mark} the rationale for
the **[[posture]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the **[threat
assessment]{.underline}**, and members' views on, and concerns over, the
implementation of the deterrence mission. National governments have the
same essential responsibility toward their parliaments and publics. NATO
must also make sure that discussions do not focus only on one strategic
direction but rather address both defense and crisis-management tasks.

Engagement with partners should include a dedicated dialogue on
deterrence issues. In some cases, based on mutual consent, NATO should
be ready to explore coordinated deterrence signaling or mutually
reinforced deterrence activities, such as joint statements, deployments,
or exercises.

Engagement with adversaries must be seen as an inseparable companion to
deterrence. Dialogue and multiple contact channels remain crucial to
convey and receive deterrence signals, avoid accidental or inadvertent
escalation, and explore risk-reduction and arms control opportunities.

DETER RUSSIA'S ADVENTURISM

In the foreseeable future, specific [challenges connected with deterring
Russia will continue to **dominate** the practical agenda]{.underline}.
As a priority, the allies should fully implement the 2018 decisions to
adapt NATO's command and force structure.4 The military credibility of
the current deterrence posture depends, to a large extent, on the
alliance's ability to speedily augment its forward-deployed units with
follow-on forces.

Th[e [allies]{.mark} [should]{.mark} look for new ways of
**stimulating** the **[develop]{.mark}ment** of **[necessary
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[interoperability]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[A **more transparent
discussion**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **major
[gaps]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in **allied capabilities** [could]{.mark}
help **[exert pressure]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on]{.mark} [members to
make **relevant investments**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The NATO Military
Committee should play a more active role in the alliance's adaptation by
more visibly highlighting the military requirements for credible
deterrence to civilian authorities and---via individual military
leaders---to NATO populations.

[[What]{.underline}]{.mark} then [[**might lead** to **cyber-attack**
causing **Article 5**]{.underline}]{.mark} to be invoked? No one knows,
as [it is **situationally dependent**. The **old way** of thinking is
that a **'severe cyber-attack'** has to involve **physical
destruction**]{.underline} -- people have to die, and physical damage
must be seen in the critical infrastructure. [However, as we become ever
**more dependent** on **data**]{.underline} and 'non-kinetic assets',
[could for example the **manipulation** of **health records** lead to
**Article 5**]{.underline} being invoked? Moreover, [is there a
difference between **banking data** and **health-care** data being
**manipulated**]{.underline}, with one potentially leading to severe
economic disruptions and the other in extremis to death.

Formulating [**clear doctrines** is frequently preferred by
**militaries**, while **politicians** and **diplomats** prefer
**flexibility** in **message** and **response**. [The
**Alliance**]{.mark} [has]{.mark} **two paths** it can chose in creating
the **doctrine regarding cyber**. It can either chose **a public
approach**, rather similar to **its approach**]{.underline} [when
creating its most **recent strategic concept**]{.underline}. In such a
document [it could generally [describe what **constitutes an attack**
that would **qualify for**]{.mark} **the invocation** of [**Article 5**,
and **what would** be an accepted]{.mark} **retaliatory
[action]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The [other path is [to **maintain
strategic ambiguity**]{.mark},]{.underline} [recognizing that
formulating **clear redlines**]{.underline} [would invite potential
adversaries to push up to the red line. In this case [developing]{.mark}
[the doctrine]{.mark} **is still important**]{.underline}, [but
[would]{.mark} then [be **for internal use
only**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} This non-public approach may reduce the
objective of improving the Alliance´s cyber deterrence. The pace of
development in the [field would [argue against]{.mark} an **[overly
specific]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[set of guidelines]{.mark} or
doctrine]{.underline}, [[lest it require **too
frequent**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline} **[politically
challenging]{.underline}** [[updates]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[The current **[']{.mark}cyber warfare playbook'** is still a **slim
volume**]{.underline} - but [it is growing by the day. In order to
**remain a credible** defence alliance, NATO must **possess** a credible
**cyber policy**, including **cyber deterrence**. Credibility comes from
a **largely similar set** of actions]{.underline} as [NATO has engaged
in regarding **conventional military**.]{.underline} Doing it in the
cyber domain is, however, harder at the moment. For example, what is the
equivalent of standing up in practice permanent battalions in member
states? How do you exercise, publicly message determination to defend
and counter aggression, in a serious but non-threatening way?

[[**NATO** has to]{.mark} find a **clear way** to [deal with a **'Cyber
Article 5'**]{.mark}]{.underline} event. [[It may be **necessary** to
**reinterpret** what **Article 5**]{.underline} [and an **armed attack**
constitute]{.underline}]{.mark} in today´s world. The biggest challenges
is [[to reach **a**]{.mark} **shared [understanding]{.mark}** [of the
**limits**]{.mark}]{.underline} (physical and cyber) [[which could
**lead** a]{.underline}]{.mark} member [[**state** to invoke **Article
5** and **delineate** what **proportionality** in]{.mark} **response
[means]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The decisions are political by their
nature and requires strong understanding on strategic cyber domain and
its development by the political actors involved. Ultimately, success
will depend on how the cyber is blended with traditional political and
military power.

### Cyber Impact\-\--AT: Defense

#### Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure cause [nuclear retal]{.underline}

Michael T. **Klare 19**, professor emeritus of peace and world security
studies at Hampshire College, "Cyber Battles, Nuclear Outcomes?
Dangerous New Pathways to Escalation," Arms Control Association,
November 2019,
armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation

Yet [another pathway to escalation could arise from a cascading series
of cyberstrikes and counterstrikes against vital national infrastructure
rather than on military targets.]{.underline} [All major powers, along
with Iran and North Korea, have developed and deployed cyberweapons
designed to disrupt and destroy]{.underline} major elements of an
adversary's key economic systems, such as [power grids, financial
systems, and transportation network]{.underline}s. As noted, Russia has
infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid, and it is widely believed that the
United States has done the same in Russia.12 The Pentagon has also
devised a plan known as "Nitro Zeus," intended to immobilize the entire
Iranian economy and so force it to capitulate to U.S. demands or, if
that approach failed, to pave the way for a crippling air and missile
attack.13

The danger here is that [economic attacks of this sort, if undertaken
during a period of tension and crisis, could lead to an escalating
series of tit-for-tat attacks against ever more vital elements of an
adversary's critical infrastructure]{.underline}, producing widespread
chaos and harm and [eventually leading one side to initiate [kinetic
attacks on critical military targets]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[risk]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ing [the slippery slope to nuclear
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, [a Russian cyberattack on
the U.S. power grid]{.underline} [could trigger U.S. attacks
on]{.underline} Russian e[nergy and financial systems]{.underline},
causing widespread disorder in both countries and [generating an impulse
for even more devastating attacks]{.underline}. At some point, such
attacks "could [[lead to major conflict and possibly **nuclear
war**]{.underline}]{.mark}."14

These are by no means the only pathways to escalation resulting from the
offensive use of cyberweapons. Others include efforts by third parties,
such as proxy states or terrorist organizations, to provoke a global
nuclear crisis by causing early-warning systems to generate false
readings ("spoofing") of missile launches. Yet, they do provide a clear
indication of the severity of the threat. [As states' reliance on
cyberspace grows and cyberweapons become more powerful, the dangers of
unintended or accidental escalation can only grow more
severe.]{.underline}

#### Causes [existential nuclear risks]{.underline}

[[Nuclear **annihilation**]{.underline}]{.mark} still **[[looms over
us]{.underline}]{.mark}**: the only consolation is that, thanks to arms
control efforts between the superpowers, there are about five times
fewer weapons than during the Cold War--- Russia and the United States
each have about seven thousand---and fewer are on 'hair trigger' alert.
However, [there are now **nine nuclear powers**, and a higher chance
than ever before that smaller nuclear arsenals might be used
**regionally**, or even by **terrorists**]{.underline}. Moreover, [we
can't rule out, later in the century, a geopolitical **realignment**
leading to a **standoff between new superpowers**. A new generation may
face **its own 'Cuba'**]{.underline}---and one that could be handled
less well (or less luckily) than the 1962 crisis was. [A
[**near-existential nuclear threat** is merely in
**abeyance**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Chapter 2 will address the twenty-first-century sciences---bio,
**[[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and AI---and what they might portend.
Their **[[misuse]{.underline}]{.mark}** [looms a[s an]{.mark}
**[increasing risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The techniques and expertise
for bio- or cyberattacks will be accessible to millions---they do not
require large special-purpose facilities like nuclear weapons do.
[Cybersabotage efforts]{.underline} like 'Stuxnet' (which destroyed the
centrifuges used in the Iranian nuclear weapons programme), [and
frequent hacking of financial institutions]{.underline}, have [already
bumped these concerns up the political agenda]{.underline}. A report
from the Pentagon's Science Board claimed that [the [impact of
cyberattack]{.mark} (shutting down, for instance, the US **electricity
grid**) [could be **catastrophic enough**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to
justify a **nuclear response**]{.underline}]{.mark}.4

#### Causes nuclear retaliation

Robert **Tilford 12**, Writer for The Examiner, "Cyber Attackers Could
Easily Shut Down the Electric Grid for the Entire East Coast," Examiner,
07/27/12,
http://www.examiner.com/article/cyber-attackers-could-easily-shut-down-the-electric-grid-for-the-entire-east-coa

"[Cyber [attackers could]{.mark} all too [easily **shut down**
the]{.mark} **electric [grid]{.mark}** for the entire east coast, the
west coast, and the middle part of our country", said Senator
Grassley]{.underline} on July 26, 2012. ["Any **one attack** could leave
dozens of major cities and tens of millions of Americans without
power]{.underline}. We know, because we were shown in a room here in the
Capitol, how an attack could take place and what damage it would do, so
we know this is not just make believe", he said. So what would a cyber
attack look like anyway? The Senator explained: ["Without ATMs or debit
card readers, commerce would]{.underline} immediately **[grind to a
halt.]{.underline}** My daughter, who lives here in the DC area, lost
power when the storm hit. They waited for a number of hours, and then
they took all the food out of their freezer, they gave away what they
could, and they threw the rest away. And that was the way it was all
over. Their power was out for about a week, and it made it very
difficult. They are fortunate enough to have a basement, and the heat
wasn't oppressive down there. [Without refrigeration, food would rot on
the shelves, the freezers would have to be emptied, and people could
actually go hungry. Without gas pumps, transportation arteries would
clog with abandoned vehicles. Without cell phones or
computers,]{.underline} whole [regions of the country would be cut off
from communication and families would be unable to reach each other.
Without air conditioning and without lifesaving technology and the
service of hospitals and nursing homes, the elderly and sick would
become much sicker and die. Most major hospitals have backup power, but
it is only]{.underline} for a [limited]{.underline} amount of time. It
depends on how much fuel they can store, and that is very limited",
Senator Grassley said. The devastation that the Senator describes is
truly unimaginable. To make matters worse [a cyber attack that can take
out a civilian power grid,]{.underline} for example [could [also]{.mark}
**~~cripple~~ [harm the]{.mark} U.S. [military]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
The senator notes that is that [the same power grids that supply cities
and towns, stores and gas stations, cell towers and heart monitors also
power "**every military base** in our country."]{.underline} ["Although
bases would be prepared to weather a short power outage]{.underline}
with backup diesel generators, [within hours]{.underline}, not days,
**[fuel supplies would run out]{.underline}**", he said. [Which means
military [command and control]{.mark} centers [could go dark.]{.mark}
Radar systems that detect air threats to our country would shut Down
completely.]{.underline} "Communication between commanders and their
troops would also go silent. And many weapons systems would be left
without either fuel or electric power", said Senator Grassley. "So [in a
few short hours or days, the mightiest military in the world would be
**left scrambling** to maintain base functions", he said.]{.underline}
We contacted the [Pentagon]{.underline} and officials [confirmed the
threat of a cyber attack is something **very real**. Top national
security officials---including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the
Director of the National Security Agency, the Secretary of Defense, and
the CIA Director--- have said, "preventing a cyber attack]{.underline}
and improving the nation's electric grids [is among the most **urgent
priorities** of our country]{.underline}" (source: Congressional
Record). So [how serious is the Pentagon taking all this?]{.underline}
[**[Enough to start]{.mark}**, or end **[a war over it]{.mark}**, for
sure]{.underline} (see video: Pentagon declares war on cyber attacks
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_kVQrp_D0kY&feature=relmfu ). [A cyber
[attack]{.mark}]{.underline} today against the US
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} very well [[be seen as an "Act of
War"]{.mark} and could be [met with a "**full scale"**]{.mark} **US
[military response]{.mark}**[. That could include]{.mark} the use of
["**nuclear weapons**]{.mark}",]{.underline} if authorized by the
President.

POTENTIAL DISRUPTERS

[Information or cyber warfare has]{.underline} the [potential to
**attack or**]{.underline} to **[disrupt successful crisis
management]{.underline}** with regard to each of the preceding
attributes.24 First, [infowar can]{.underline} **[muddy]{.underline}**
the **[signals]{.underline}** [being sent from one side to the other in
a crisis. This can be done deliberately **or inadvertently**. Suppose
one side plants a virus]{.underline} or worm in the other's
communications networks.25 [The virus]{.underline} or worm [becomes
activated during]{.underline} the [crisis]{.underline} and destroys or
alters information. [The missing or altered information may make
it]{.underline} more [difficult for the]{.underline} cyber [victim to
arrange]{.underline} a [military attack; however, destroyed or altered
information also may **mislead** either side into **thinking** that its
signal has been interpreted **correctly**]{.underline} [when it has
**not**]{.underline}. Thus, side A may intend to signal "resolve"
instead of "yield" to its opponent on a particular issue; side B,
misperceiving what it has received as a "yield" message, may decide to
continue its aggression, but then meets unexpected resistance, causing a
much more dangerous situation to develop. [There is]{.underline} also
[the possibility of]{.underline} **[cyber]{.underline}**-enabled
**[preemption]{.underline}** [to disable]{.underline} enemy
**[nuc]{.underline}**lear missile**[s]{.underline}** before they reach
the launchpad or during the launch itself. Apparently, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has used such
"left-of-launch" techniques against]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea.26 [During]{.underline} a [nuclear
crisis]{.underline}, [would such a move be]{.underline}
**[accepted]{.underline}** by the attacked party [as]{.underline} one of
**[intimidation]{.underline}** and deterrence [or]{.underline}, to the
contrary, [would]{.underline} **[offensive cyber war]{.underline}**
against missile launches [prompt a]{.underline} **[nuclear first
use]{.underline}** or first strike by the defender [for fear of losing
its **retaliatory capability?**]{.underline}

[Infowar also can destroy or disrupt]{.underline}
**[communication]{.underline}** [channels]{.underline} [necessary for
successful crisis management]{.underline}. One way it can do this is [by
disrupting]{.underline} **[communication links]{.underline}** between
policy makers and military commanders [during a period of high threat
and]{.underline} severe [time pressure]{.underline}. [Unanticipated
problems]{.underline}, from the standpoint of civil-military relations,
[may arise]{.underline} under these conditions. For example, [political
leaders may have]{.underline} **[predelegated]{.underline}** [limited
authority for nuclear release]{.underline} or launch under restrictive
conditions; only when these few conditions obtain, according to the
protocols of predelegation, would military commanders be authorized to
employ nuclear weapons distributed within their commands.27 [Clogged,
destroyed, or disrupted communications could prevent]{.underline} top
[leaders]{.underline} from [knowing that military commanders perceive a
situation to be far **more desperate**, and thus
**permissive**]{.underline} [of nuclear]{.underline} [**initiative**,
than it]{.underline} really [is]{.underline}. For example, [during the
Cold War, disrupted communications between the U.S. national command
authority and ballistic-missile submarines, once the latter came under
attack, could have resulted in a]{.underline} **[joint
decision]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} submarine **[officers and
crew]{.underline}**, in the absence of contrary instructions,
[to]{.underline} **[launch]{.underline}**.

Second, [infowar during]{.underline} a [crisis almost certainly will
increase the]{.underline} **[time pressure]{.underline}** [under
which]{.underline} political [leaders operate. It may do this
**literally**, or]{.underline} it [may affect]{.underline} the
[perceived **timelines** within which the policy-making process yields
its decisions. Once either side sees parts of its]{.underline} command,
control, and communications ([C3]{.underline}) [system being
subverted]{.underline} by phony information or extraneous cyber noise,
[its sense of]{.underline} **[panic]{.underline}** [at the
possible]{.underline} **[loss of]{.underline}** military
**[options]{.underline}** [will be]{.underline}
**[enormous]{.underline}**. In the case of American Cold War nuclear war
plans, for example, disruption of even portions of the strategic C3
system could have prevented competent execution of parts of the Single
Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), the nation's strategic nuclear war
plan. The Cold War SIOP depended on finely orchestrated time-on-target
estimates and precise damage expectancies against various classes of
targets.28 Partly misinformed or disinformed networks and communications
centers would have led to redundant attacks against the same target sets
and, quite possibly, unplanned attacks on friendly military or civilian
installations. Even in the post--Cold War world of flexible
nuclear-response plans, the potential slide toward preemption, on the
basis of mistaken or exaggerated fears of C2 vulnerability, casts a
shadow over deterrence stability. As Blair has warned, "There are no
widely accepted methods for calculating command and control performance
under wartime conditions, and empirical validation of such an assessment
cannot be done. Compared with the tight and tidy standard calculations
of force vulnerability, any objective assessment of command and control
systems would raise more questions than it answered."29

[A]{.underline} **[third]{.underline}** potentially [disruptive
effect]{.underline} of infowar [on nuclear-crisis management is that it
may reduce the search for available alternatives to the few and
desperate. Policy makers seeking escapes from crisis]{.underline}
denouements [need]{.underline} **[flexible options]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [**creative problem-solving**. Victims]{.underline} of
infowar [may have]{.underline} a [diminished ability to **solve
problems** **routinely**, let alone **creatively**, once information
networks are **filled** with **flotsam** and **jetsam**. Questions to
operators will be posed poorly, and responses (if available]{.underline}
at all) [will be driven toward]{.underline} the least common denominator
of [previously programmed SOPs]{.underline}. [Retaliatory systems that
depend on launchon-warning dynamics instead of **survival
after**]{.underline} riding out an **[attack]{.underline}** [are
**especially vulnerable**]{.underline} [to reduced time cycles and
restricted alternatives. "A well-designed warning system cannot save
commanders from misjudging the situation under the constraints of time
and information imposed by a posture of launch on warning. Such a
posture truncates the decision process too early for iterative estimates
to converge on reality. Rapid reaction is inherently unstable because it
cuts short the learning time needed to match perception with
reality."]{.underline}30

The propensity to search for the first available alternative that meets
minimum satisfactory conditions of goal attainment is strong enough
under normal conditions in nonmilitary bureaucratic organizations.31 [In
civil-military C2 systems under the **stress of nuclear-crisis
decision-making**, the **first** available alternative quite **literally
may be the last**---or so policy makers and their military advisers may
**persuade themselves**]{.underline}. [Accordingly, the bias toward
**prompt**]{.underline} and adequate [solutions is
**strong**.]{.underline} During the Cuban missile crisis, for example, a
number of members of the presidential advisory group continued to
propound an air strike and invasion of Cuba during the entire thirteen
days of crisis deliberation. Had less time been available for debate and
had President Kennedy not deliberately structured the discussion in a
way that forced alternatives to the surface, the air strike and invasion
might well have been the chosen course of action.32 Paul K. Davis and
coauthors have noted the following:

> Usual discussions of crisis stability assume that leaders are in
> control of their nuclear capabilities. Again, history is sobering.
> President Kennedy became worried in 1961 about possible unilateral
> actions by military leaders to prepare a preemptive strike against the
> Soviet Union. He instigated efforts to tighten the President's
> personal control. Soviet leadership worried about survivability of its
> forces and developed capability for launch on warning and automatic
> response. Such systems could be the source of accidental war.33

[Fourth and finally on the issue of crisis management, infowar can cause
**flawed images of each side's intentions**]{.underline} and
capabilities to be conveyed to the other, [with]{.underline} potentially
**[disastrous results]{.underline}**. Another example from the Cuban
missile crisis demonstrates the possible side effects on U.S. crisis
management of simple misunderstanding and noncommunication. At the most
tense period of the crisis, a U-2 reconnaissance aircraft got off course
and strayed into Soviet airspace. U.S. and Soviet fighters scrambled,
and a possible Arctic confrontation of air forces loomed. Khrushchev
later told Kennedy that Soviet air defenses might have interpreted the
U-2 flight as a prestrike reconnaissance mission or as a bomber, calling
for a compensatory response by Moscow.34 Fortunately, Moscow chose to
give Washington the benefit of the doubt in this instance and to permit
U.S. fighters to escort the wayward U-2 back to Alaska. Why this
scheduled U-2 mission was not aborted once the crisis began never has
been revealed fully; the answer may be as simple as bureaucratic inertia
compounded by noncommunication down the chain of command by policy
makers who failed to appreciate the risk of "normal" reconnaissance
under these extraordinary conditions.

The significance of the preceding discussion and examples is underscored
by the assessment of expert analyst Martin C. Libicki about the
relationship between cyber war and crisis management.

> To generalize, a situation in which there is little pressure to
> respond quickly, in which a temporary disadvantage or loss is

SCENARIOS AND RISKS

[The outcome of a nuclear-crisis-management scenario influenced by
information operations may]{.underline} **[not be]{.underline}** a
**[favorable]{.underline}** one. [Despite the **best
efforts**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} crisis [participants, the
dispute may **degenerate**]{.underline} [into]{.underline} a **[nuclear
first use]{.underline}** or first strike by one side [and]{.underline}
**[retaliation]{.underline}** by the other. In that situation,
information operations by either side or both might make it more
difficult to limit the war and bring it to a conclusion before
catastrophic destruction and loss of life has taken place. Although
[there are **no such things as "small" nuclear wars**]{.underline}
compared with conventional wars, there can be different kinds of
"nuclear" wars, in terms of their proximate causes and consequences.36
Possibilities include a nuclear attack from an unknown source; an
ambiguous case of possible, but not proved, nuclear first use; a nuclear
"test" detonation intended to intimidate, but with no immediate
destruction; or a conventional strike mistaken, at least initially, for
a nuclear one.

With regard to the last-mentioned case, George H. Quester has noted that
the "United States and other powers have developed some very large and
powerful conventional warheads, intended for destroying the hardened
underground bunkers that may house an enemy command post or a
hard-sheltered weapons system. Such 'bunker-buster' bombs radiate a
sound signal when they are used and an underground seismic signal that
could be mistaken from a distance for the signature of a small nuclear
warhead."37 In such an instance, the adversary may question why its
command posts or strategic assets are being targeted and assume the
actions are the prelude to an all-out strategic strike.

The dominant scenario of a general nuclear war between the United States
and the Soviet Union preoccupied Cold War policy makers, so concerns
about escalation control and war termination were swamped by apocalyptic
visions of the end of days. The second nuclear age, coinciding roughly
with the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Soviet Union, offers
a more complicated menu of nuclear possibilities and responses.38
Interest in the threat or use of nuclear weapons by rogue states,
aspiring regional hegemons, or terrorists, abetted by the possible
spread of nuclear weapons among currently non-nuclear-weapons states,
stretches the ingenuity of military planners and fiction writers.

[In addition to]{.underline} the possibility of the world's worst
characters engaging in **[nuclear]{.underline}** threat or first
**[use]{.underline}**, [there also may be]{.underline}
**[backsliding]{.underline}** [in **political conditions**]{.underline},
[such as between the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} [**Russia**, or]{.underline}
**[Russia]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**China**, or]{.underline}
**[China]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[India]{.underline}** (among
current nuclear-weapons states). [Arguments assuming the]{.underline}
**[continuation of stable deterrence]{.underline}** among major powers
[depend on the continuation of favorable **political
auguries**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} regional or [global politics.
Conflicts that are politically unthinkable in one decade have a way
of]{.underline} **[evolving]{.underline}** [into]{.underline}
**[wars]{.underline}** [that are]{.underline} **[politically
unavoidable]{.underline}** in another; World War I is instructive in
this regard. The war between Russia and Georgia in August 2008 was a
reminder that local conflicts on regional fault lines between blocs or
major powers have the potential to expand into worse. So, too, were the
Balkan wars of Yugoslav succession in the 1990s. In these cases,
Russia's one-sided military advantage relative to Georgia in 2008 and
NATO's military power relative to that of Bosnians of all stripes in
1995 and Serbia in 1999 contributed to war termination without further
international escalation.

[Escalation of a conventional war into nuclear first use]{.underline}
**[remains possible]{.underline}** [where operational or tactical
nuclear weapons have been deployed with]{.underline}
**[national]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[coalition armed
forces]{.underline}**. In allied NATO territory, the United States
deploys several hundred substrategic, air-delivered nuclear weapons
among bases in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey.39
Russia probably retains several thousand operational or tactical nuclear
weapons, including significant numbers deployed in western Russia.40 The
New Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (New START) agreement establishes a
notional parity between the United States and Russia in nuclear systems
of intercontinental range.41 But U.S. and allied NATO superiority in
advanced-technology, information-based conventional military power
leaves Russia heavily reliant on tactical nukes as compensation for
comparative weakness in nonnuclear forces. NATO's members breathed a
sigh of relief when Russia's officially approved Military Doctrine of
2010 did not seem to lower the bar for nuclear first use compared with
previous editions.42

However, [**Russia's** military doctrine **does indicate** a
**willingness** to engage in **nuclear first use** in situations of
extreme urgency for Russia, as defined by its political
leadership]{.underline}.43 And, despite NATO's evident superiority in
conventional forces relative to those of Russia, neither the United
States nor the rest of NATO is necessarily eager to get rid of its
remaining substrategic nukes deployed among America's NATO allies. An
expert panel that NATO convened to set the stage for its 2010 review of
the alliance's military doctrine was carefully ambivalent on the issue
of the alliance's forward-deployed nuclear weapons. The possibility of
negotiating away these weapons in return for parallel concessions from
Russia was left open for further discussion. On the other hand, the NATO
expert report underscored the present majority sentiment of governments
that these weapons provided a necessary link in the chain of alliance
deterrence options.44

Imagine now the unfolding of a nuclear crisis or the making of a
decision for nuclear first use, under the conditions of both NATO and
Russian campaigns employing strategic disinformation and information
operations intended to disrupt enemy C3 and warning systems. Disruptive
information operations against enemy systems on the threshold of nuclear
first use, or shortly thereafter, could increase the already substantial
difficulty of bringing fighting to a halt before a Europe-wide theater
conflict or a strategic nuclear war ensues. All the previously cited
difficulties in crisis management under the shadow of nuclear deterrence
pending a decision for first use would be compounded by additional
uncertainty and friction after the nuclear threshold had been crossed.

In addition, three new kinds of frictions would be posed for NATO.
First, the cohesion of allied governments would be tested under
conditions of unprecedented stress and danger, doubtless aided by a
confused situation on the field of battle. Second, reliable intelligence
about Russian intentions following Russian or NATO first use would be
essential but challenging to nail down. Third, the first use of a
nuclear weapon in anger since Nagasaki would establish a new
psychological, political, and moral universe within which negotiators
for de-escalation and war termination would have to maintain somehow
their sangfroid, obtain agreed stand-downs from their militaries, and
return nuclear-capable launchers and weapons to secured but transparent
locations. All this would be taking place within the panic-spreading
capabilities of 24/7 news networks and the Internet.

Theoretically, one might finesse the issue by eliminating cyber
operations that potentially conflict with de-escalation. But the
political desire to do so conflicts with the military need for timely
information gathering, assessment, and penetration of enemy networks to
accomplish two necessary, but somewhat opposed, missions. First, each
side would want to anticipate correctly the timing and character of the
other's decision for nuclear first use---and, if possible, to throw
logic bombs, Trojan horses, electronic warfare, and other impediments in
the way. (Or, if methods of finesse are not available, bombing the
relevant installations is always an option, although obviously a
provocative one.) The second, and somewhat opposed, mission is to
communicate reliably to the other side one's preference for
de-escalation, one's willingness to de-escalate if reciprocity can be
obtained, and one's awareness of the possibility that the situation
shortly will get out of hand. Consider the Russian General Staff and the
president's office filtering this hydra-headed group of messages while
their forces are grappling in Georgia or Ukraine, with the smaller
country having been taken into NATO membership, say, a year earlier,
over Russia's objections.

The problem of nuanced messages and the management of de-escalation,
even short of war, is illustrated by the 1983 iteration of NATO's
command-post exercise ABLE ARCHER, held 7--11 November that year. An
annual exercise, ABLE ARCHER was intended to practice nuclear-release
procedures. Soviet intelligence routinely monitored these exercises.
However, the 1983 version took place against a background of rising
U.S.-Soviet political tensions and heightened suspicions within the
Soviet political leadership and military high command that the United
States and NATO might be preparing for a nuclear first strike. One
reason that Russian sensitivities to the possibility of U.S. or NATO
nuclear first use or first strike were high at this time was NATO's
decision to begin deploying Pershing II ballistic missiles and
ground-launched cruise missiles of intermediate range in Europe,
beginning in the fall of 1983. Soviet and Warsaw Pact reactions to ABLE
ARCHER 83 included an unprecedented surge of Warsaw Pact technical
collection, a significant increase in reconnaissance by Soviet strategic
and naval aviation, and other unusual Soviet moves that indicated
increased concern about NATO and U.S. intentions.45 The case illustrates
how mistaken interpretations of "normal" events can overvalue
pessimistic assessment at just the wrong time.46 As the President's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board concluded in 1990, "We believe that
the Soviets perceived that the correlation of forces had turned against
the USSR, that the US was seeking military superiority, and that the
chances of the US launching a nuclear first strike---perhaps under cover
of a routine training exercise---were growing. We also believe that the
US intelligence community did not at the time, and for several years
afterwards, attach sufficient weight to the possibility that the war
scare was real."47

[The possibility of nuclear war by inadvertent escalation
did]{.underline} **[not disappear]{.underline}** [with the end of the
Cold War. The Russian]{.underline} **[General Staff]{.underline}**
[remained alert to the possibility of a U.S. nuclear attack even as
**political relations**]{.underline} between the two early post--Cold
War states [were]{.underline} **[officially nonhostile]{.underline}**.
In one instance, a U.S.- Norwegian Black Brant research rocket was
launched from an island off the coast of Norway on 25 January 1995 to
study the northern lights. This triggered a reaction from Russia's
missile-early-warning system, which alerted senior Russian defense
officials, including then-President Boris Yeltsin, who for the first
time activated his nuclear briefcase until confirmation was received
that no attack was in progress.48

Avoiding mistaken nuclear preemption in a complex information
environment is one kind of challenge; the problems in coordinating the
management of de-escalation and conflict termination with the conduct of
information operations offer another. Two examples follow. The first,
already alluded to, is the use of a bunker-busting or other
advanced-technology conventional weapon that the other side, during the
fog of crisis or war, confuses with a nuclear first use or first strike.
Russia expressed this concern specifically during New START negotiations
in 2010, with regard to American plans to deploy some conventionally
armed ballistic missiles on nuclear-capable intercontinental or
transoceanic launchers.49 New START counting rules regard conventionally
armed ballistic missiles as being nuclear-capable launchers, and
therefore subject to overall restrictions on the numbers of deployed
launchers and weapons. U.S. plans for Prompt Global Strike systems to
include missiles or future space planes were approved first during the
George W. Bush administration and carried forward under the Obama
administration.

A second illustration of the problem of managing escalation control and
conflict termination alongside information operations, one separate from
the issue of escalation in Europe, is provided by the proposal for a
joint NATO-Russian theater-missile-defense (possibly including air
defenses) system. The idea had expert and highly visible political
proponents on both sides of the Atlantic, and official Russian
commentators have not closed the door to the possibility of some
cooperation on ballistic-missile defenses (BMDs). Here, NATO and Russia
are facing in two political directions: toward each other, displaying
wariness but also openness; but regarding Iranian or other Middle
Eastern leaders who may get their hands on nuclear weapons in the
future, and who may be beyond deterrence based on the credible threat of
nuclear (or other) retaliation, displaying concern.

However, the problems of achieving missile-defense cooperation between
NATO and Russia are not only political. Even with the best of intentions
among U.S., NATO, and Russian negotiators, the military-technical
difficulties involved in coordinating BMD C3 systems are considerable.
Indeed, they are not strictly "military-technical" but also heavily
embedded with issues of political sovereignty; classified intelligence;
and trust, among both governments and militaries. Even among NATO
members, militaries differ in their national traditions,
military-service identities, experiences in nuclear arms control, and
willingness to share online information in real time with temporary
partners who may be future enemies. For example, if a European
theater-wide system of intelligence and missile-attack warning is
established, how many capitals will host relevant servers and receive
timely output? Who will decide that a missile warning is now a threat
requiring activation of the European BMD system---can a single nation do
so if a missile is headed its way, or must NATO (including the United
States) and Russia agree before any action is taken in response?

[If a]{.underline} **[political crisis]{.underline}** [between NATO and
Russia erupts, and both sides **already have deployed missile
defenses**, will Russian or American **cyber warriors**]{.underline}
[attempt to **spoof**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} otherwise **[negate
the other's missile-defense component?]{.underline}** Would it be better
to reassure Russia regarding the surety of its own missile defenses, as
against the possibility of a conventional or nuclear preemption? Neither
Russia nor the United States will want to relinquish sovereign control
over its part of any cooperative missile defenses. However, would it be
more prudent to announce a withdrawal from the cooperative aspect of the
regional BMD system during a crisis or to maintain the fiction of
cooperation while attacking the other side's cyber systems with Trojan
horses, logic bombs, and trapdoors---just in case? Perhaps, in future
nuclear or other crises, the U.S. and Russian cyber commands should have
their own direct "hotline," or in this case an encrypted digital link.

3\. Fragility and Systemic Risk

As [technologies]{.underline} develop, they [often]{.underline} **[build
on]{.underline}** [one another, so that the continued operation of
the]{.underline} **[system]{.underline}** [depends on a growing set
of]{.underline} **[other]{.underline}** [systems. The way]{.underline}
that [failure]{.underline} occurs and **[propagates]{.underline}** [in
such systems is]{.underline} [**non-obvious**, but]{.underline} it [is
largely dependent on the]{.underline} **[topology of]{.underline}** the
**[interdependence]{.underline}** between components. Pastor-Satorras,
Castellano, Van Mieghem, and Vespignani (2015) **[Simple]{.underline}**
[dependencies, where a system **requires**]{.underline} [the functioning
of every component, can make the resulting **system of systems** **more
fragile**]{.underline} [than the components]{.underline}. A very basic
model of this shows that given a system-of-systems with N components,
each of which independently can fail at the rate Fi the failure rate is
![Text Description automatically
generated](media/image1.png){width="0.8462128171478566in"
height="0.19897965879265092in"}. [While this grows more slowly than the
sum of the individual failure rates as new systems are added, it is also
far higher than the average failure rate of those individual
systems.]{.underline}

[As a concrete **example**, the peak of]{.underline} **[efficient
farming]{.underline}** [once required]{.underline} **[family
farms]{.underline}** [to depend on a]{.underline}
**[family]{.underline}** to manage the farm, [a]{.underline}
**[blacksmith]{.underline}** to make horseshoes and plows,
[and]{.underline} draft **[animals]{.underline}** to pull them. Losing
any one of these would be enough to (eventually) make the system unable
to continue, and there was some risk that this would occur. Still, [the
limited number of inputs and]{.underline} the
[substitutability]{.underline} of other inputs [made such systems
fairly]{.underline} **[stable]{.underline}** - [especially
because]{.underline} many [risks were]{.underline}
**[uncorrelated]{.underline}** [across farms, and could often be
addressed by borrowing]{.underline} from other farms nearby.

The [farms of today]{.underline}, of course, [are]{.underline} **[not
nearly]{.underline}** [as simple. They require everything from
**satellite GPS**]{.underline} systems to pinpoint locations,
[to]{.underline} the **[semiconductors]{.underline}** and fabrication
plants used [to make]{.underline} specific **[integrated
chips]{.underline}** used in the farm equipment, [to]{.underline}
**[internet]{.underline}** connectivity [to run]{.underline} **[machine
learning]{.underline}** algorithms [using collected data and satellite
imagery]{.underline} on remote servers. Zubarev, Fomin, and Zubarev
(2019) [Modern agribusiness depends on everything from finding and
hiring]{.underline} **[skilled laborers]{.underline}** to manage complex
machinery, [to managing regulatory, financial, and other factors
critical to farm operation]{.underline}. Kingwell (2011) [These
are]{.underline} often more **[tightly correlated]{.underline}** [across
an economy, **increasing**]{.underline} [risk. Beyond that, managing
these farms requires understanding "human, technical, economic,
financial, risk, institutional and social" issues]{.underline}, as Lewis
et al. noted more than a decade ago. Lewis, Malcolm, and Steed (2006)

[The risk is]{.underline} likely [not yet]{.underline} [**critical**,
but]{.underline} it seems clear that [**dependence is growing**, and the
ability to use]{.underline} **[backup]{.underline}**
system**[s]{.underline}** [can be]{.underline} **[lost]{.underline}**.
For example, [if remote servers become unavailable, local corn farms may
lack the information needed to decide where to increase and decrease
watering]{.underline} levels, [or even lose]{.underline} the [ability to
run their computer-controlled irrigation]{.underline} systems.
Similarly, decades ago supplies and ordering were managed on paper, and
now, without the servers running Software-as-a-Service
supply-chain-management software, the dairy farm down the road may not
have access to an inventory of their supplies or know what amounts of
products are needed or what they have historically ordered, and end up
unable to feed their cows.

The inter-dependencies in such systems are more complex than the above
model allows, but more complex analyses, such as those employing
percolation analysis to understand mutual interdependency of multiple
networks, Buldyrev, Parshani, Gerald Paul, Stanley, and Havlin (2010)
show the same trend. That is, **[interdependent]{.underline}** [systems
where failures]{.underline} can **[propagate]{.underline}** can be
**[far more likely]{.underline}** to **[fail]{.underline}** than the
average rate at which the individual systems' components fail. Worse,
analysis of "high--value, technology-- and engineering--intensive
products or systems...used to produce consumer goods and services" has
shown that the failure rates are nearly-additive, and worse, are hard to
identify. Yeo and Ren (2009)

It should be noted that modern computer networks do not display such
fragility, but this is a function of intentional design. Metcalfe and
Boggs (1976) Simple network structures, such as lines or rings, are far
more prone to failure Clark, Pogran, and Reed (1978). That is, unless a
system was designed for resilience, resilience should not be expected.
And when technological systems are made efficient and complex, they tend
to be tightly coupled - meaning that failure in one place spreads
Bookstaber (2007).

3.1. Inevitable Technological Fragility Hypothesis

The proposal of this paper, to provide an addendum to Bostrom\'s
hypothesis, is that if technological development continues indefinitely,
**[systemic fragility]{.underline}** [will increase to the point
that]{.underline} the possibility of [a **shock**]{.underline}
[sufficient for]{.underline} **[complete collapse]{.underline}**
[approaches]{.underline} certainty.

This hypothesis rests on a number of assumptions, but there are also a
variety of reasons to find it plausible and concerning. To lay these out
clearly, we will first consider the question of how and why individual
systems are fragile, then make an argument that it is at least plausible
that the multiple interconnected systems and systems-of-systems which
are necessary for much of modern civilization not only fail to address
this risk, but multiply it.

4\. Single-System Complexity and Fragility

The key question so far is whether fragility increases over time as
systems are built. The answer to that question depends on a combination
of factors that can push in either direction. These include increasing
complexity of systems, the economic incentives for efficiency over
robustness and the resulting levels of investment in resilience, the
failure rates of individual components and systems, as well as the way
in which systems-of-systems (and systems-of-systems-of-systems) are
interrelated, and the extent to which systems and their
interdependencies are designed to be robust.

Even the claim of inevitable fragility in individual systems makes
several assumptions about how fragility increases. Before looking at the
systemic question of how fragility could lead to collapse, we will
outline these assumptions. Note that these are in fact assumptions,
rather than claims - if any one of them is false in ways that are
outlined, it would refute the hypothesis. The third assumption is
particularly critical, and will be explored further in the next
subsection.

First, for fragility to matter, the current trend of
efficiency-increasing and resilience-decreasing technologies must
continue to apply to at least one critical system, such as agriculture,
communication, or transport. If this is wrong, and future white-ball /
safe exploration technologies are ones that favor robustness over
efficiency in all such critical domains, the trend would reverse. For
instance, distributed fault tolerant computing arguably increases both
efficiency and robustness. Most new technologies move in the opposite
direction, but if enough resilience increasing technology is found, the
balance could shift.

Second, the argument for increasing fragility assumes that economic
growth continues to absorb human effort in a way that does not lead to
overabundant resources. In Eric Drexler\'s 'Paretotopia' scenario,
increased resources are unmatched by increased demand. Drexler (2019) In
that future case, resources are abundant enough that robustness is easy
to achieve. This second scenario also assumes the absence of
supercharged competition that uses the newly abundant resources. This
would not occur, for example, in Hanson\'s proposed default "Em"
scenario, where human-based intelligences are simulated computationally,
leading to a reduction rather than an increase in surplus that could be
redirected to robustness for lack of other needs. Hanson (2016)

Third, it assumes that fragility is relatively hard to identify, such
that at least some failures will be unanticipated. This has been true
historically, but it is possible that future developments would reverse
this trend, making the search for increased robustness itself efficient
enough to counterbalance the more general and destabilizing increased
fragility that new technology allows. If failures do become easy to
anticipate, more expensive general resilience can be replaced with more
specific redundancies targeted to the exact failure modes identified.

4.1. Non-Obvious Fragility

As mentioned, hard-to-identify fragility is a key assumption. Broadly
speaking, non-obvious fragility is the result of planning for
efficiency, instead of designing for redundancy, fault tolerance, or
even provable safety. This is a fairly general fact about any control
system. Paattilammi and Makila (2000) The concrete result of the current
optimization shows clear signs of producing fragile results. One example
is the proliferation of disposable technology, such as fragile
smartphones designed to be replaced rather than fixed or upgraded.
Failure of these optimized devices is normal, and while mitigating
failure is important, it is often the case that risk must be accepted,
rather than avoided. Perrow (2011) This type of fragility is obvious and
anticipated, rather than non-obvious and worrying. For example,
individual computers are fragile, and components fail frequently. For
this reason, in high-reliability computer systems, a variety of
mechanisms are in place to compensate, including redundant online
systems for data storage, Chen, Lee, Gibson, Katz, and Patterson (1994)
or methods to address other hardware failures. Wang, Zhang, and Xu
(2017)

The fact that computer networks are not fragile, and the fragility that
does exist is well understood, seems to be a counterexample. But the
resilience itself is planned, in contrast to ecological systems where it
is emergent - as we will discuss in detail below. This means that
fault-tolerant designs are built to be tolerant of expected faults. Not
only that, but resilience itself is optimized, for example, to minimize
the number of backups or other costs needed to have a planned level of
reliability. Rodrigues-da Silva and Crispim (2014) This creates
fragility to unexpected faults, and allows the systems to operate
through anticipated contingencies, but not to anything beyond that
point.

4.2. Sociotechnical Resilience

Fragility of systems is not based purely on the lack of resilience of
technical systems. In fact, fragility of optimized technical systems is
compensated for by the greater robustness of sociological systems. The
combined sociotechnical system, then, is the level at which fragility
should be considered.

To reduce the fragility of sociotechnical systems, organizations can
attempt to build more resilience at the organizational level. This can
involve information sharing, distributed decision making, and better
risk assessment. If done well, these attempts provide a sociotechnical
system that compensates for technical and operation risk, but is again
very different from emergent resilience. Langeland, Manheim, Mcleod, and
Nacouzi (2016) Unfortunately, the interaction between humans and
technology can often multiply risks, rather than mitigate them. Yeo and
Ren (2009)

Another reason to think that sociotechnical resilience will not fully
compensate for technological fragility is the reduced human involvement
in technical systems. As automation increases, Danzig notes that humans
are increasingly necessarily out-of-the-loop. Danzig (2018) He further
argues that when there is competition, this dynamic is a necessary
result of continued optimization.

To conclude the discussion of single-system fragility, we note that
inevitable fragility of systems is not actually required for the
hypothesis presented. As this section argued, it does seem plausible
that in expectation, new technologies will be more fragile than those
they replace. However, [systemic risk can exist given the much weaker
claim that specific critical systems are relied upon, and technological
improvements relevant to those systems alone exhibit sufficient
**fragility** to cause a **cascading collapse**]{.underline}. Before
discussing the interaction between systems, however, it is worth
considering how these human, technical, or sociotechnical systems differ
from naturally resilient biological systems.

actors ranging from **state-sponsored**]{.underline} [groups
to]{.underline} **[criminal]{.underline}** [enterprises, to **anyone
with an Internet connection**]{.underline} who wishes to do harm.
[Cyberattacks on the various elements of the U.S. critical
infrastructure occur on a]{.underline} [**daily basis**. For
instance]{.underline}, the Industrial Control Systems- Computer
Emergency Response Team (**[ICS-CERT]{.underline}**) [reports that U.S.
industrial control systems were attacked at least]{.underline} **[245
times over a 12-month period]{.underline}** (OAS, 2015). [\"While China,
the U.S. and Russia lead the world in cyberattacks, virtually every
government engages in such attacks, and nearly every country has its
share of computer hackers\"]{.underline} (Wagner, 2017). [The ability to
launch a successful cyber-attack makes **every nation- state**, into
a]{.underline} **[potential super power]{.underline}** (Wagner, 2017).
[Perhaps the most egregious example comes from the Ukraine]{.underline}.
In December 2015, a presumed Russian cyberattacker successfully seized
control of the Prykarpattyaoblenergo Control Center (PCC) in the
Ivano-Frankivsk region of Western Ukraine (Wagner, 2017). This attack
marked the first time that a concerted cyber-attack was successfully
launched against a nation\'s power grid (Wagner, 2017). However Stuxnet,
in 2010, might be the first instance of a nation enforcing policy
through other means (Howard & Parot, 1976). [The perpetrators of the
Ukrainian attack were observed conducting]{.underline} **[similar
exploits]{.underline}** [against the U.S. energy sector]{.underline}
(Brasso, 2016). [Although there was never any **actual** disruption,
many experts believe that those activities were a]{.underline}
**[probe]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} **[future moves on the U.S.
infrastructure]{.underline}** (Brasso, 2016). [One key question is,
\"Could a]{.underline} **[catastrophic cyberattack in the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[Infrastructure ever
occur?]{.underline}** The National Security Agency\'s former Director,
Mike Rodgers, made his own evaluation of the possibility of a successful
attack against critical infrastructure when he said; \"[It\'s a matter
of,]{.underline} **[when, not if\']{.underline}** (Smith, 2014).
**[Power grids]{.underline}** [are the most frequently mentioned
target]{.underline} (Wagner,2016; Brasso, 2016; Smith, 2014) [due to the
interconnectedness of power grids which opens them up to **\"cascading
failures\".**]{.underline} [As nearby grids take up the slack for a
failed grid system, they overload and fail themselves, causing
a]{.underline} **[chain reaction]{.underline}**. Rogers says that [such
attacks are part of \"coming trends\" in which so-called zero-day
vulnerabilities in U.S. cyber systems are exploited]{.underline} (Smith,
2014). [The reason why the protection of our national infrastructure is
so critically important is that a major exploit, like a successful
cyberattack on the electrical grid could leave the U.S.]{.underline}
[**cloaked in darkness**, **unable to communicate**]{.underline} [and
without any form of **twenty-first century transport**. It
would]{.underline} likely [kill]{.underline} **[many]{.underline}**
thousands of citizens, perhaps **[millions]{.underline}** either
[through]{.underline} [**civil unrest**, failure of]{.underline}
[**public systems**, or]{.underline} **[mass starvation]{.underline}**
(Brasso, 2016; Maynor, 2006). Many experts believe that [the
cyberwar]{.underline} **[began in 2003]{.underline}** (Wagner, 2017)
when the Northeast (U.S.) blackout occurred. That blackout caused 11
deaths and an estimated \$6 billion in economic damages (Wagner, 2017).
After the attack, SCADA attacks occurred in the UK, Italy and Malta,
among others. According to Dell\'s 2015 Annual Security Report,
cyber-attacks against infrastructure systems doubled in 2014 to more
than 160,000. (Wagner, 2017) Infrastructure systems are diverse and
coupled with the criticality of the sensors and controllers that
comprise a typical infrastructure system, make them tempting targets for
attack. Therefore, there have been long-standing concerns about the
overall digital infrastructure being vulnerable to cyberwarfare and
cyberterrorism attacks (Eisenhauer, 2006, Nat-Geo, 2017).
[Notwithstanding the]{.underline} **[disastrous nature]{.underline}**
[of cyberattacks on digital targets, none of the industries in our
current national infrastructure have developed coherent plans, or
effective strategies, to]{.underline} **[protect
themselves]{.underline}** (Brasso, 2016). This has caused an increasing
interest in a coherent model for defending the critical infrastructure
against cyberattack (Symantec, 2014; E-Y, 2014).

### Grid Impact\-\--AT: Alt Cause\-\--EMP

#### No EMP alt cause

Strikes Back", Foreign Policy, 5/24/2013,

Jim [[Woolsey]{.underline}]{.mark}, a former director of central
intelligence and [[noted]{.underline}]{.mark} Oklahoma City
[[**conspiracy theorist**, and]{.underline}]{.mark} Peter [[Pry]{.mark}
had an op-ed]{.underline} in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday
[[warn]{.mark}ing that]{.underline} North Korea might attack United
States with a nuclear weapon. But instead of vaporizing Washington,
Woolsey and Pry warn that [**[No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea
would]{.underline} use just one bomb to [create a massive]{.underline}
electromagnetic pulse [[(EMP)]{.mark} that [would]{.mark}]{.underline}
fry our iPhones and [[end]{.mark} \"modern
[civilization]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

It will be like The Hunger Games meets Red Dawn!

[If you aren't familiar with the crowd of **cranks** and **threat
inflators** banging the EMP drum, this scenario might seem a little
**far-fetched**]{.underline}. It does seem like [[the]{.mark} sort of
[overcomplicated plot]{.mark} dreamed up by a Bond villain, one that
**[only works in]{.mark}**]{.underline} the movies. **[[Bad
movies]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Well, bad movies and terrible books --- like Newt Gingrich and William
Forstchen's potboiler One Second After, about life in the United States
after an EMP attack. Yes, that's right. Newt Gingrich wrote dime-store
pulp fiction about the aftermath of an EMP attack. I am just going to
give you a minute here to compose yourself.

All better? Okay, as I said, Newt Gingrich wrote a book about EMP. EMP
advocates get a little cranky when you make fun of it. An indignant
Peter Pry once responded to mockery of the book by comparing One Second
After to Uncle Tom's Cabin. Really.

That's because the EMP crowd is about raising \"awareness.\" The
Heritage Foundation even promotes \"EMP Awareness Day.\" And Congress
empanelled a Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from
Electromagnetic Pulse Attack in 2001 (and reauthorized it in 2006) and
even has an \"EMP Caucus.\" No, I don't know if they wear little tinfoil
hats at their caucus meetings. Why would you ask something like that?

The possibility of an electromagnetic pulse wiping out Western
civilization --- or at least our local varietal --- is a hardy perennial
of a particular worldview espoused by types like the John Birch Society.
EMP \"awareness\" basically occupies the space vacated by activism in
the 1950s for civil defense. For a flavor of the old civil defense
paranoia, I recommend a slim volume from 1968 entitled \"Who Speaks for
Civil Defense?\" --- particularly a chapter by the late Steuart Pittman
that perfectly captures the paranoia of the movement.

Sharon Weinberger, author of the excellent Imaginary Weapons, has
already written a readable account of the craziness of this view in
these very electronic pages (\"The Boogeyman Bomb\"), which elicited a
letter from Pry that took itself very, very seriously. The humorlessness
of the EMP movement is not surprising. This is about scaring people. Any
mirth is entirely unintentional.

For such a dry, serious subject, [the amount of [actual data on]{.mark}
the [threat]{.mark} from electromagnetic pulse attack [is]{.mark}
**pretty [thin]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Electromagnetic pulse is, of
course, a real phenomenon produced by a nuclear explosion. [The EMP
Commission likes to point to its \"years\" of research based on
\"decades\" of data]{.underline} on the effects of nuclear weapons. [But
at the end of the day, even if we understand the physics of
electromagnetism, [there is **no credible way to model**]{.mark} the
[mass effect]{.mark} of a pulse [on a]{.mark} complex system like our
power [grid]{.mark} or our communications infrastructure]{.underline}.

The United States and the Soviet Union did engage in high-altitude
nuclear testing before realizing this might not be the greatest idea,
eventually banning tests in the atmosphere and outer space. The most
famous event was called Starfish Prime --- a 1.4 megaton nuclear
explosion conducted by the United States in the Pacific in July 1962. By
contrast, North Korea's 2013 nuclear test --- its largest and most
successful --- was on the order of 10 kilotons, or more than a
hundred-times smaller.

[EMP [threat-mongers]{.mark}]{.underline} sometimes [**[dramatically
exaggerate]{.mark}** the [effects]{.mark} of Starfish
Prime]{.underline}. For example, Lowell Wood, later a member of the EMP
Commission, described the impact of Starfish Prime to Congress in
plainly apocalyptic terms. Starfish Prime, he said, \"very unexpectedly
turned off the lights over a few million square miles in the
mid-Pacific. This EMP also shut down radio stations, turned off cars,
burned out telephone systems, and wreaked other mischief throughout the
Hawaiian Islands, nearly 1,000 miles distant from ground zero.\"

All of which was terrible --- or would have been, had it happened. It
did not.

Starfish Prime was bad, but it was not nearly so dramatic as Wood
claimed. In fact, lots of people turned out to watch the explosion from
hotels and beaches in Hawaii, including reporters sent to cover it.

Take a gander at the coverage in Life Magazine, which has some really
beautiful images of the event. My favorite account comes from Dick
Stolley. He's famous, by the way. He would later buy the Zapruder film.
Stolley reported on Starfish Prime from the beach at Waikiki:

There were coeds in muumuus, college boys in swimsuits, tourists in
newly purchased resort wear, sleepy kids.... \[The blast was\] white and
hot, like the flash of a breaking electrical circuit. It turned almost
instantly to a bright bilious green, a color so unexpected that watchers
gasped.

Tough assignment, huh? Life doesn't mention what Stolley did next, but
given his fond recollection of the drinks cart after putting an issue of
Life to bed, I like to think he slipped back to the Royal Hawaiian for a
Mai Tai and to interview any coeds in muumuus who happened to be around.

Now, as I say, Starfish Prime did do some damage, even if Waikiki's luau
schedule was uninterrupted. The electromagnetic pulse and other effects
probably killed off two or three satellites in orbit, which was bad
enough. The explosion may also have damaged some telephone equipment,
but [there were no telephone outages]{.underline}. (Military
communications and test instrumentation all worked fine.) [Some street
lights]{.underline} on Ferdinand Street in Manoa and Kawainui Street in
Kailua also [went out. Of course, street lights and telephone systems
experience everyday failures, too. You'd be surprised at how hard it is
to demonstrate that street light failures are the result of an
electromagnetic pulse rather than, say, faulty fuses]{.underline}.
(Apparently, the answer turns on fascinating questions like \"How many
clear plastic washers were in transformer cutouts that failed?\")
[Contemporary reports mention continuous radio coverage of the event
with no outages]{.underline}.

So let's be clear: Starfish Prime did not "turn off the lights over a
few million square miles in the mid-Pacific.\" It did not shut down any
radio stations or cars or burn out the telephone system. The biggest
problem that Dick Stolley and other reporters had filing their stories
the next day was probably a hangover.

Even if we understand how an electromagnetic pulse works and have data
about the vulnerability of equipment, [[a modern]{.mark} system like a
power [grid]{.mark} or communications network [presents]{.mark} just
[**too complex** a set of **resiliencies**]{.mark} and
vulnerabilities]{.underline}.

[The solution of the EMP Commission was simply to collect
more]{.underline} data, essentially creating laundry lists of things
that might go wrong. [For example, the [EMP Commission exposed]{.mark}
37 cars and 18 trucks to EMP effects in a laboratory
environment.]{.underline} While EMP advocates claim the results of an
EMP attack would be \"planes falling from the sky, cars stalling on the
roadways, electrical networks failing, food rotting,\" the actual
results were much more modest. [Of the [55 vehicles]{.mark}
exposed]{.underline} to EMP, [[six]{.mark} at the highest
levels]{.underline} of exposure [[needed to be
restarted]{.underline}]{.mark}. A few more showed \"nuisance\" damage to
electronics, such as blinking dashboard displays.

This kind of experiment is better than nothing, of course, but it
doesn't model the effect of an EMP event on urban transportation
networks. Would the result be massive pile-ups on expressways?
Carmaggedon? Friday afternoon on the Beltway? The experiment raises as
many questions as it answers, including, \"How did they get enough money
to purchase 55 vehicles?\" I can't help but wonder if they just rented
them one by one. \"How was your car, Mr. Graham?\" \"Oh, yeah, uh, the
dash display is blinking.\" \"We're sorry to hear that, we hope it
wasn't an inconvenience.\" \"What? Oh, well, never mind. All's well that
end's well, that's what I say.\"

The bottom line is that [[there]{.mark} simply [isn't enough
**ev**]{.mark}idence [to support the wild claim]{.mark} that [a
single]{.mark} nuclear [weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}, or even a few,
[detonated]{.underline} at high altitudes [[would pose an
**\"existential threat\"**]{.mark} to \"modern
civilization,\"]{.underline} as Woolsey and Pry claim. [[It would be a
**nuisance**]{.mark}, but preferable to having the bomb detonate in a
major city]{.underline}.

**[Security experts]{.underline}** have [argued]{.underline} for some
time that [the]{.underline} **[energy sector]{.underline}** [has become
a]{.underline} potential [target for]{.underline} **[cyber
attack]{.underline}** [through the creation of **Internet links**---both
**physical** and **wireless**---that interfere with]{.underline} the
supervisory control and data acquisition (**[SCADA]{.underline}**)
[systems]{.underline} used by electrical and power distribution
networks.16 [SCADA systems manage the flow of
**electricity**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} natural [**gas**, while
also being used to control]{.underline} the [industrial systems and
facilities used by chemical processing plants, water purification and
water delivery operations, wastewater management facilities, and a
**host** of **manufacturing firms**]{.underline}.17 [Studies have
indicated that critical infrastructures that include SCADA systems may
be **vulnerable to a cyberterrorist attack**]{.underline} [because the
infrastructure and the computer systems used are]{.underline} [**highly
complex**, making it]{.underline} effectively [impossible to
eliminate]{.underline} **[all]{.underline}** potential
**[weaknesses]{.underline}**.18 It is believed by many security
professionals that [a terrorist's ability to control, disrupt, or alter
the command and monitoring functions performed by SCADA systems
could]{.underline} **[threaten]{.underline}** regional or national
**[security]{.underline}**.19 Cyberterrorism, when considered generally,
may be conducted by either state or non-state actors, but the calculus
and implications can be quite different for each category. Of note, the
U.S. Department of State lists three designated state sponsors of
terrorism in 2015: Iran, Sudan, and Syria.20 State sponsored
cyberterrorism would most likely be conducted to achieve the goals as
defined by the state's political leadership and any actions would tend
to support long-term national security goals. Even though the cyber
domain offers a bit of anonymity, if a cyber attack is traced back to
its network source or Internet address, then the physical location of
those perpetrating the attack could be determined within the boundaries
of the state authorizing the cyber attack. Because states have
geographic boundaries and the initiating computer networks potentially
have a physical location, there is increased likelihood, when compared
to non-state actors, that those responsible for initiating a
state-sponsored cyber attack would be identified. In contrast, non-state
actors---to include many terrorist organizations---do not necessarily
act uniformly or according to the same underlying beliefs, and many of
the most aggressive organizations are motivated by an ideology that
embraces martyrdom and an apocalyptic vision.21 This ideology may be
based on religion or a desire to overthrow a government. Terrorists who
are motivated by ideology and intend to conduct cyber attacks against
the United States or its interests may not care about the repercussions
following an act of cyberterrorism, whether military in scope or not. In
such a scenario, some strategists think a terrorist organization's
leadership may prove undeterrable by traditional military means.22
Despite the disparate motivators of terrorists, many terrorist
organizations, to include al-Qaida and the self-proclaimed Islamic
State, are said by some security experts to function strategically and
rationally.23 Because a terrorist organization's leadership may be
inclined to make rational decisions, deterrence may at times be a
suitable method of influencing future actions. Consequently, deterrence
should be considered a critical element in a successful national
strategy to prevent cyberterrorism. The Advantages of Cyberterrorism
There are several advantages to using the cyber domain to conduct acts
of terrorism. First, [cyberterrorism can be far]{.underline} **[less
expensive]{.underline}** [than traditional]{.underline} terrorist
[methods]{.underline}.24 Potentially, [all that is needed is a personal
computer and an Internet connection, instead of needing to buy weapons,
like guns or explosives, or acquire transportation.]{.underline}25
Second, [cyberterrorism has the potential for being more]{.underline}
**[anonymous]{.underline}** than traditional, kinetic methods.26 It can
be difficult for security and police agencies to track down the identity
of terrorists when they use online "screen names" or are an unidentified
"guest user."27 Third, [the number of]{.underline} **[potential
targets]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[enormous]{.underline}** when
compared to the number of targets typically used in kinetic actions.[The
cyberterrorist could target the computer networks of governments,
individuals, public utilities, private airlines, SCADA systems, and
other critical networks. The **sheer number**]{.underline} of potential
cyber targets [is thought to increase the likelihood that an adversary
can find a weakness or vulnerability in one of the different networks to
exploit. Finally, cyberterrorism can be conducted]{.underline}
**[remotely]{.underline}**, a feature that may be especially appealing
to some would-be attackers. Exaggerated Threat? [Many]{.underline}
critics [have noted]{.underline}, however, [that while the]{.underline}
potential [threat]{.underline} of cyberterrorism [is alarming and
despite]{.underline} all the [dire predictions]{.underline} of impending
attack, [no single instance]{.underline} of real cyberterrorism [has
been recorded]{.underline}.28 [To date]{.underline}, there has been no
recorded instance of cyberterrorism on U.S. public facilities,
transportation systems, nuclear power plants, power grids, or other key
components of the national infrastructure. While cyber attacks on
critical components of the national infrastructure are not uncommon,
such attacks have not been conducted in a manner to cause the kind of
damage or severity of effects that would qualify as cyberterrorism.29
The 2007 widespread denial of service cyber attack in Estonia, which
brought down the banking system for three weeks, did not cause
catastrophic damage, injury, or death.30 Even in the case of the Stuxnet
malware, discovered in June 2010 and called "world's first digital
weapon" because of its capability of causing physical destruction to
computers and other equipment, did not cause widespread, severe
destructive effects.31 [This begs the question: Just how real is the
cyberterrorism threat?]{.underline} While cyberterrorism may be an
attractive option for modern terrorists who value its remote access,
anonymity, potential to inflict massive damage, and psychological
impact, [some critics say that cyber fears have been
exaggerated]{.underline}.32 Furthermore, there is disagreement among
some cyber experts about whether critical infrastructure computers, to
include SCADA systems, offer an effective target for furthering
terrorists' goals.33 Many computer security experts do not believe that
it is possible to use the Internet to inflict damage, injury, or death
on a large scale.34 Some of these experts note that critical computer
systems are resilient to attack through the investments of time, money,
and expertise during the design and development of these critical
systems. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense, Central
Intelligence Agency, and Federal Bureau of Investigation are reported to
protect their most critical systems by isolating ---also called
air-gapping---them from the Internet and other internal computer
networks.35 [Despite the ongoing debate]{.underline} about whether the
cyberterrorism threat is exaggerated or if the potential destructive
effects can be sufficiently achieved to warrant concern,
[both]{.underline} the [news media and government reporting indicate
that some terrorist organizations now use the Internet to]{.underline}
[**communicate**, **recruit**]{.underline} people, raise funds,
[and]{.underline} **[coordinate]{.underline}** future
**[attacks]{.underline}**.36 [Even though there is]{.underline}
[no]{.underline} **[publically available information]{.underline}**
[that terrorist organizations have directly and successfully attacked
Internet servers]{.underline} or major computer networks, [reporting
does suggest that many terrorist organizations]{.underline} would
**[employ cyber means]{.underline}** to achieve their goals if the
opportunity presented itself.37 [Because there appears to be a
persistent **desire**]{.underline} by some terrorist organizations [to
use any and all means, including cyber attacks, to achieve their desired
goals, it is paramount for policy makers and]{.underline} military
[planners to take]{.underline} **[preparatory actions]{.underline}** [to
prevent such acts and mitigate any effects should such an attack
occur]{.underline}. These preparatory actions include deterrence
efforts.

4\. Real-world attacks Among others, the **[STUXNET]{.underline}** worm
infection \[17\] [perfectly represents the **frailty of the regulatory
systems** devoted to control critical infrastructures]{.underline}.
First isolated in mid-June 2010, STUXNET was a computer virus
specifically designed for attacking Windows based industrial computers
and taking control of Programmable Logic Controller (PLCs), influencing
the behaviour of remote actuators and leading to instability phenomena
or even worse. The paradox is that critical infrastructures massively
[rely on newest **interconnected**]{.underline} (and vulnerable)
Information and Communication Technology (**[ICT]{.underline}**)
[technologies]{.underline}, [while the **control equipment** is
typically **old, legacy software/hardware**]{.underline}. [Such a
combination of factors may lead to very **dangerous situations**,
exposing the systems to a wide variety of attacks. The lesson the
CIIP]{.underline} (Critical Information Infrastructure Protection)
[community has learned from the spread of the **STUXNET**]{.underline}
[worm is that, in order to effectively react to a specific low level
menace, there is the need to consider both the global and local
perspectives]{.underline}. In fact, besides obtaining a wider
perspective on the state of the System of Systems, there is the need to
increase the intelligence of equipments and devices that are used to
influence the behaviour of the system, such as RTUs, valves, etc.
Moreover, as emphasised by several episodes \[18\], [another effective
way to paralyse a SCADA system via cyber attack is to saturate the
**bandwidth of the carrier**]{.underline} [used for the
**communication**]{.underline} [(this was, for example, the way in which
the SLAMMER worm operated in 2003 to affect the SCADA of two United
States (US) utilities and a nuclear power plant).]{.underline} [Indeed,
as emphasised also by the ANSI/ISA]{.underline}.99 (American National
Standards Institute/International Society of Automation), [availability
is the most crucial attribute of information security. The lack of
timely **information**]{.underline} to/from the field [may cause
**dramatic consequences**]{.underline} [because the field is unable to
receive the adequate command, hence even **trivial** episodes may
provoke **dramatic impact**, as shown by the **US
black-out**.]{.underline} In an evaluation of the Mariposa botnet
infection in an ICS organisation, the US Department of Homeland Security
\[19\] explained that they found that the infection occurred when an
employee used a USB drive to download presentation materials to a
corporate laptop. When the user connected the laptop to the corporate
network upon returning to work, the virus spread to over 100 hosts. [The
security of SCADA]{.underline} communications [is becoming more
complicated because the decision has been taken to link the SCADA
networks with **IT networks**]{.underline} [to allow better and faster
communications. But these new features have increased the **threats**
and **risks on SCADA communications**]{.underline}. There are presently
no convinced solutions to enforce the security of SCADA communications
in that perspective. The idea to add intelligence to the field is not
new; electro-valves for gas pipelines are available on the market that,
in the case they receive a rapid sequence of open-close commands, do not
perform them in order to avoid the consequence of the mechanical shock.
A number of EU (European Union) projects such as the FP6 SAFEGUARD and
FP7 CRUTIAL (CRitical UTility InfrastructurAL Resilience) have explored
the technical feasibility to improve cyber security of SCADA system by
improving the smartness of the field devices. 5. Discussion **[Further
complication]{.underline}** [arises because it is known that a large
percentage of attacks are induced by **inside attackers**. Thus
**perimeter defense alone cannot defend the system**]{.underline}. In
such cases, the question that one is confronted with is whether there is
enough indication of an ongoing attack in the dynamics of the system
itself \[20\]. Despite this range of activities, it has been proven that
half of these have human error at their core \[21\]. Therefore, there
should be increased empirical and theoretical research in to human
aspects of cyber security based on the volumes of human error related
incidents in order to establish ways in which mainstream cyber security
practice can benefit. Security measures tend to neglect that persistent
attackers will eventually gain access whatever that perimeter protection
may be. One main objective from modern security solutions would be to
develop novel methods that could detect and disturb the activities of
the attackers once they have gained access inside the system. Special
care should be given to the implementation of new strategies that can
detect, prevent and mitigate data exfiltration attacks, since intrusion
detection/prevention strategies are now deemed to be inadequate for data
protection \[22\]. In order to strengthen the security of SCADA systems,
one solution is to deliver defence in depth \[23\] by layering security
controls so as to reduce the risk to the assets being protected. By
applying multiple controls on top of the information asset (in this case
the SCADA and ICS configuration and management data) the architect
introduces further barriers, which a threat actor has to overcome. For
the more competent threat actors this will slow them down. Within the
time it takes to get through some of the controls, the protective
monitoring service should have alerted someone to the attack, which will
allow further action to be taken (such as dropping the threat actors
connection). Defence in depth ensures there is no single point of
failure from threats to assets by providing differing barriers
(controls) in a layered approach. 6. Conclusions [The synergy between
the **ICS and the IoT**]{.underline} [has emerged largely bringing **new
security challenges**]{.underline}. We have identified key security
issues for ICS and current solutions. Future work should primarily focus
on the balance between holistic approaches that can deal with a wide
variety of attacks, real time identification of intruders with high
accuracy and solutions that impose low overhead to the communication and
performance of SCADA/ICS systems.

[Critical infrastructure owners and operators "**continue to
experience** increasingly sophisticated cyber intrusions, which provide
malicious actors the ability to disrupt the delivery of essential
services, cause physical damage to critical infrastructure assets, and
potentially produce **severe cascading effects**."]{.underline} 28
According to one estimate, [between 2000 and 2015, there
were]{.underline} **[15]{.underline}** suspected
cyber-**[attacks]{.underline}** or events [against the U.S. electricity
grid]{.underline}.29 Reported cybersecurity incursions into industrial
control systems (ICS) within the U.S./Canadian energy sector have
decreased slightly in the past two years (see Table 1), despite an
overall increase in the number of reported ICS incidents across the
broader economy. [So far, these incursions have been
unsuccessful]{.underline} at inhibiting or disrupting power system
operations, [but the continued rollout of]{.underline} **[smart grid
tech]{.underline}**nologies [makes us]{.underline} **[increasingly
vulnerable]{.underline}**.30 Public and private resources have been hard
at work for many years to identify critical energy infrastructure and
implement robust action plans to prevent, detect, respond to, and
mitigate the potential effects of malicious cyber-attacks. The U.S. bulk
power system has been subject to mandatory and enforceable
**[cybersecurity standards]{.underline}** since 2008.31 These standards
[are continuously updated]{.underline}, most recently in 2016.32
Critical assets such as control centers, transmission substations, and
generators must receive a full panoply of protections, including cyber
protections, physical protections, cyber and physical access
limitations, security training for appropriate personnel, and the
development and implementation of incident response and asset recovery
plans. Violations are punishable by civil penalties of more than
\$1,000,000 per violation per day.33 And [yet a **recent
simulation**]{.underline} [by Lloyds and the University of Cambridge\'s
Centre for Risk Studies, called Business Blackout, found that
an]{.underline} **[extreme event]{.underline}**, while unlikely,
**[remained plausible]{.underline}**.34 Business Blackout simulated [a
fictionalized scenario]{.underline} that was [designed by subject matter
experts and subjected to peer review]{.underline} "to
[ensure]{.underline} that the [effects could]{.underline} **[plausibly
be achieved]{.underline}**." The simulation assumed that the U.S. was
targeted by a significantteam of personnel with a high level of skill
who spent many months on careful research, preparation, and operational
implementation.35 In the Project Blackout scenario, intruders planted
malicious code that took control of 50 generators and caused them to
overload or even catch fire. As a result, 15 U.S. states were plunged
into darkness, leaving 93 million people without power. The scenario
showed a rise in mortality rates as health and safety systems failed, a
decline in trade as ports shut down, disruption to water supplies as
electric pumps failed, and chaos to transport networks as infrastructure
collapsed. The estimated impact to the U.S. economy ranged from \$243
billion to more than \$1 trillion.36 The Business Blackout researchers
found that this scenario, "while improbable, is technologically
possible." 37

[US adversaries have also shown an increasing capability and intent to
target its industrial control systems recently.]{.underline} Since 2011
[known or suspected hackers in several countries have run]{.underline}
supervisory control and data acquisition (**[SCADA]{.underline}**)
**[exploitation attempts]{.underline}** [against US critical
infrastructure.]{.underline} In September 2015 in testimony before the
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Director of National
Intelligence James **[Clapper]{.underline}** [revealed that unknown
Russian cyber actors had compromised]{.underline} the **[supply
chains]{.underline}** of at least three industrial control system
vendors. He warned, "Politically motivated cyber-attacks are now a
growing reality, and foreign actors are reconnoitering and developing
access to U.S. critical infrastructure systems."6 Cyberspace threats
also headlined Clapper's February 2016 testimony to the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence on worldwide threats. In subsequent hearings
before the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and
Capabilities in March 2016, Adm. Mike **[Rogers]{.underline}**,
commander of US Cyber Command and director of the National Security
Agency (NSA), [testified that "industrial control systems and SCADA
probably is the **next big area**]{.underline} for us [because we've got
to transition from a focus purely on the network
structure]{.underline}."7 He noted that the Department of Defense (DOD)
has already begun looking at data concentrations and focusing more on
industrial control systems and SCADA. Rob Joyce, chief of the NSA's
Tailored Access Operations unit, complains that SCADA security keeps him
up at night. Joyce understands how to exploit such systems;8 he also
appreciates how vulnerable the United States is, in turn, and that the
"Internet of things" will multiply those vulnerabilities exponentially.9
[**Supply chain vulnerability**, another dimension of the problem, was
raised]{.underline} during Admiral Rogers's hearings before the Senate
Armed Services Committee in April 2016. Specific processes exist in the
US government to address these issues for some components of DOD
infrastructure, particularly nuclear systems, but not for other major
systems or components. The DOD's focus on network security is now
expanding to focus on the risks to individual combat platforms, weapons
systems, and individual data concentrations. In the National Defense
Authorization Act of 2016, Congress directed the secretary of defense to
complete an evaluation of the cyber vulnerabilities of every major
weapons system by December 2019.

[The December 2015 events in Ukraine, where multiple electric companies
were hacked---the first power outage known to be caused by a cyber
attack---should serve as a]{.underline} **[wake-up call]{.underline}**.
Hackers used malware to gain access to the Ukrainian utilities' business
networks and, from there, maneuvered to their production networks and on
to operator stations. The [hackers]{.underline} then [remotely
disconnected the breakers of]{.underline} [**thirty substations**.
According to Robert M. Lee of Dragos Security,]{.underline} **["Every
bit of this is doable in the U.S. grid."]{.underline}** [Although the US
grid is]{.underline} **[more]{.underline}** [hardened]{.underline} than

### Grid Impact\-\--Vunlerable Now\-\--AT: Airgapping

#### Airgapping doesn't solve.

SCADA PLC and Fieldbus Cyber-Security." Proceedings of the 13th
International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security: National Defense
University Washington DC, USA.

[Air gapped systems attempt to achieve security by **completely
segmenting networks**]{.underline} [and disallowing]{.underline} any
[**connections to external networks**. This generally required any
**data access** to be performed from within a]{.underline} **[secure
facility]{.underline}** [with physical security]{.underline} assets [in
place]{.underline}. **[Stuxnet]{.underline}** (Failliere, Murchu and
Chien 2011) [has shown us that]{.underline} **[even facilities such as
these can be compromised]{.underline}** through the introduction of
unauthorized code walked in on USB sticks and/or disgruntled
employees/contractors with direct network access. [Once the network has
been breached, an attack on]{.underline} the **[PLC\'s]{.underline}**
[and the]{.underline} **[local fieldbus network]{.underline}** [become
possible]{.underline}. However, physical separation of disparate
networks may make an attack more difficult to execute in that some sort
of physical presence is required. [Many control systems that **purport**
to have physical network separation do so only in a]{.underline}
**[virtual]{.underline}** [manner. Firewalls, virtual local area
networks]{.underline} (VLAN), [virtual private networks]{.underline}
(VPN), [demilitarized zones]{.underline} (DMZ), [and other tools are
used to logically segment networks such that, theoretically, networks
are effectively, if not literally, airgapped]{.underline} (Knapp 2011;
Stouffer, Pillitteri, Lightman et al. 2015). This allows for convenience
in that authorized communications can be allowed without requiring a
physical presence. This requires that all software and hardware systems
be correctly setup and kept current which is often a complex and
time-consuming task. **[Errors]{.underline}** [may create]{.underline}
**[vulnerabilities]{.underline}** [that could be]{.underline}
[**exploited**. The more complex the software and configuration, the
more room for error.]{.underline}

SCADA PLC and Fieldbus Cyber-Security." Proceedings of the 13th
International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security: National Defense
University Washington DC, USA.

As shown, [If the control center can be breeched and access gained to
the network, then the **lack of security features** in many common
fieldbus protocols may be exploited. These protocols often **lack even
simple password capabilities**]{.underline} [and those that do, often
transmit in]{.underline} **[clear text]{.underline}**. **[Encryption is
not common]{.underline}**. [It is not unusual for ОТ staff to use
**shared passwords** or for device vendors to have]{.underline}
**[hard-coded passwords]{.underline}** [into their products]{.underline}
(Krutz 2005;Knapp 2011). Strong security policies that are enforced can
help to mitigate some of the risk, but [an unsecure
protocol]{.underline} **[remains unsecure]{.underline}**. Rush, Kinast,
and Shaw (Rush 2006) with the American Gas Association (AGA) noted that
encryption is uncommon in many control system protocols and championed
the development of a device to sit on each end of the communications
path between the control center and a remote PLC/RTU. This device would
encrypt/decrypt network traffic between the endpoints thus providing
secure communications of even unsecure protocols. Though this device was
designed over ten years ago, it has not been heavily deployed.

U.S. Power Grid." The Electricity Journal, vol. 30, no. 3, pp. 30--35.

Some [industry analysts predict enormous growth of
microgrids]{.underline} in the next five years, [but]{.underline}
**[technical, economic, and regulatory barriers remain.]{.underline}**
Technical barriers. [Most distributed energy resources as currently
installed are incapable of providing **backup power**
during]{.underline} a grid **[outage]{.underline}**, [because they
weren't designed with **resiliency** in mind. For a distributed energy
resource to provide electricity during a grid outage, it must be
designed to function as a **standalone system**]{.underline} that can
isolate itself from the grid and continue power production in island
mode. [For safety reasons, current operating standards require that
grid-connected resources automatically **disconnect**]{.underline} from
the grid during a power outage. [Most]{.underline} of these systems [are
currently designed to **cease**]{.underline} power
**[production]{.underline}** once they disconnect from the grid,
[leaving customers in the **dark**]{.underline}.61 Thus, for example,
the majority of New Jersey\'s distributed energy resource systems,
including solar, combined heat and power, fuel cells, and other
renewables, did not operate during or after Superstorm Sandy when the
distribution grid went down.62 In order to provide resilience and
security of supply benefits to consumers, these systems need to be
designed -- and in some cases reconfigured -- so that they can operate
in island mode when they are disconnected from the grid. **[Economic
barriers]{.underline}**. [Microgrids are **cost-prohibitive** for many
customers, particularly in the **residential** sector. Federally
funded]{.underline} research63 and tax [incentives]{.underline}64 [have
been **essential**]{.underline} in making distributed solar PV
technology available to an increasing number of Americans.
[However]{.underline}, there is real concern that [these]{.underline}
federal programs [may be reduced or even eliminated as part
of]{.underline} President [Trump\'s announced intention to cut spending
on initiatives linked to climate change]{.underline}. In the current
political environment, it may become increasingly important to focus the
debate on alternative justifications for decentralized power resources,
such as resilience and security of supply. **[Regulatory
barriers]{.underline}**. Regulatory barriers [complicate and even
prohibit the deployment of microgrids in some areas]{.underline}.
Microgrids typically require the use of existing power distribution
lines or the construction of new power lines within a defined zone,
which may infringe on traditional utility franchise rights. Microgrid
[operation may involve the exchange of power between parties or the
distribution of power across streets or public areas, which could make
operators subject to comprehensive public utility
regulation]{.underline}. The **[lack of clarity]{.underline}**
[regarding interconnection rules and who]{.underline}
**[pays]{.underline}** for necessary equipment and network upgrades [is
another major barrier.]{.underline} New financing models are also needed
to overcome the barrier of high upfront costs and make microgrids more
accessible to a broader number of customers.65

Bill **White 15**. 3-17-2015, \"6 Ways The Power Grid Could Collapse,\"
Survivopedia. http://www.survivopedia.com/the-power-grid-could-collapse/

Of all our infrastructure, [the electrical power grid is]{.underline}
the most **[fragile]{.underline}**. In the 2013 Infrastructure Report
Card, prepared by the American Society of Civil Engineers, Energy
received a grade of D. The only reason it was that high, was that the
energy category includes all classes of energy, not just electrical
energy. However, in the narrative, the ASCE described the true condition
of the electrical grid, declaring that it needed over one trillion
dollars of investment to survive the next ten years. The problem is that
[our electrical grid]{.underline}, like much of our infrastructure, [was
designed for a 50 year lifespan.]{.underline} [If you look
at]{.underline} the average age of [our]{.underline} power plants and
[distribution network]{.underline}, it's clear that way [too much of it
is]{.underline} over **[well over the halfway point]{.underline}** in
its lifespan. In fact, [there is a considerable amount of it that is
still in use, even though it is past its programmed life. **It doesn't
take much**]{.underline} [to leave us without electrical
power]{.underline}. A good snowstorm or thunderstorm will knock down
power lines, leaving people without electrical power. Larger storms,
like [[hurricane]{.mark}s can do]{.underline} enough
[damage]{.underline} to the electrical grid to leave people without
electrical power for weeks. [However]{.underline}, that's a little
misleading. The only reason that the [damage]{.underline} to the grid
[[is fixed]{.underline}]{.mark} so [[rapidly]{.underline}]{.mark} in
cases like a hurricane is that that [\[[because]{.mark}\] power
[companies send]{.mark} in **[teams from outside the
area]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} help with
[repair]{.underline}s. **[If there was [a nationwide
event]{.mark}]{.underline}** that caused the loss of electrical power,
**[it [would take]{.mark} [much longer]{.mark} to repair the damage;
both [due to]{.mark} a [lack of crews and]{.mark} a lack of necessary
[equipment]{.mark}.]{.underline}** When we talk about the grid, we are
actually talking about three independent, but interconnected grids.
There is an eastern grid, a western grid and the Texas grid. So, taking
the grid down actually requires taking three separate grids. {adinserter
emp}Destruction of the grid, regardless of whether it is by intent or by
accident is actually not all that hard to accomplish. [[The entire grid
is]{.mark} inter[connected]{.mark} and to some extent automated. When
[one part]{.mark} of the grid becomes
**[overloaded]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by]{.underline}
**[demand]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} by **[loss of power production
capability]{.underline}**, [it automatically [compensates,
bringing]{.mark} in [resources from farther away]{.mark}]{.underline} to
provide the needed power. **[[Were that to happen enough times, the
whole system would]{.mark} become [overload]{.mark}ed.]{.underline}**

Foreign Policy, 4/12/17, "Why international law serves U.S. national

Now, [with over]{.underline} [560 major multilateral instruments
deposited with the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[N]{.underline}ations [alone, citizens around the world benefit every
day from rules their governments have adopted conjointly with each
other]{.underline}. These [agreements]{.underline}, as the American
Society of [[International Law]{.underline}]{.mark} has documented,
[[enable]{.underline} [worldwide
telecom]{.underline}]{.mark}[munications]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[postal networks; universal recognition of]{.underline} [time
standards]{.underline}; [improved]{.underline} [[weather
forecasting]{.underline}]{.mark}; [stronger [safety]{.mark} standards
[for]{.mark} automobiles, airplanes, and [ships]{.mark}; sharing of
information about the origin of our food and other
products]{.underline}; [protection of software, literary, and artistic
works; and [preservation **of cultural heritage sites**]{.mark} and
**[endangered species]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to name a few.\[1\] With
the adoption of international human rights treaties after World War II,
these rules expanded to protect people from torture and other forms of
inhumane treatment; promote equal protection for women and children,
including for adopted children and those caught in custody disputes; and
facilitate pursuit of war criminals, terrorists, human smugglers, and
drug traffickers. [[Agreements to protect the public]{.mark} and the
environment [from]{.mark} chlorofluorocarbons ([CFCs) and]{.mark} other
harmful [pollutants]{.mark} are among some of the more effective binding
instruments of modern international law.¶]{.underline} Despite these and
many other obvious benefits from international law, the political
culture of the United States has turned markedly sour when it comes to
ratifying treaties that demonstrably serve its national interests. Two
recent examples immediately come to mind: The U.N. Convention on the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which is modeled on the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990 and would protect disabled Americans when
traveling overseas, was denied Senate ratification in 2012 based on
spurious charges it would impinge on home schooling.\[2\] Similarly, the
U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, endorsed by senior U.S. military,
defense, business, and environmental leaders as a key instrument for
protecting U.S. interests in safe passage for its vessels and in its
200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone, was blocked by 34 Republican
senators in 2012 on grounds it would, inter alia, bind the United States
to third party arbitration.\[3\] Meanwhile, China and others are shaping
the rules and practices of the treaty body that regulates exploitation
of seabed resources without Washington having a seat at the table. ¶
Such pro-sovereignty sentiments are now the dominant view in the White
House and most of the Republican-controlled Congress. That is likely to
spell further trouble for preserving U.S. leadership of an international
order which has overwhelmingly served U.S. interests in a coherent
system of rules and customs that has given us 70 years free of direct
major power conflict and impressive economic prosperity.¶ The Justice
Stephen Breyer Lecture series on international law, formally established
in 2014 in partnership with the Netherlands Foreign Ministry, the mayor
of The Hague, and The Hague Institute for Global Justice, was created to
help policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic think about new
challenges to international law and order. It would be fair to say that
when our cooperation on this initiative began in 2013, we did not
imagine that the pendulum swing against the underpinnings of the
international order would advance as far and as fast as it has in the
last year. Core beliefs and lessons learned from the 20th century are up
for grabs around the world, including on both sides of the Atlantic, at
least judging from current political discourse favoring nationalism over
"globalism." A trans-Atlantic approach, therefore, is particularly
timely and relevant.¶ A trans-Atlantic perspective is also valuable as
an intellectual endeavor because Europeans and Americans come from
different historical perspectives, a point James Madison made in 1792:
"The \[U.S.\] Constitution is a charter of power granted by liberty,"
not, as in Europe, "a charter of liberty...granted by power."\[4\] The
Declaration of Independence's reference to "a decent respect to the
opinions of mankind" was an early indication, however, that America's
founding fathers felt an obligation to consider the views of others,
even its former colonial masters, in matters of law and justice. Justice
Breyer, "the great transnationalist judge of our age," has taken up that
charge in the modern era, following in the tradition of Chief Justices
John Marshall and John Jay.\[5\]¶ Since then, trans-Atlantic
jurisprudence has largely converged around some fundamental principles
based on national constitutions, the United Nations Charter, and
institutions founded after World War II---"shared public norms with
similar meanings in every national system of the world," as Professor
Harold Koh puts it. But meaningful differences remain and often revolve
around the limits to which citizens and their representatives are
prepared to cede traditional sovereignty to an international body. The
European Union, for example, is wrestling mightily with both the
benefits and costs of "pooled sovereignty." While the United States may
be a laggard when it comes to adopting certain treaties, it is not
immune from the judicial and legislative decisions of other countries,
as Justice Breyer himself explained so well in his inaugural lecture at
Brookings. In a quickly changing world, he said, "we better learn what
is going on elsewhere because that affects directly what we do at the
Supreme Court. In a word, understanding and referring to what is
happening abroad is often the best way to preserve our American
values,"\[6\] particularly our faith in the rule of law for ourselves
and in our relations with others.¶ Justice Breyer's analysis of five
areas in which the development of law in other parts of the world has a
direct effect on U.S. judicial decisionmaking includes matters highly
relevant to public debates today, from protecting civil liberties from
executive overreach to determining the application of World Trade
Organization rules and decisions to U.S. domestic law. Under a Trump
White House and Republican-controlled Congress clamoring to put America
first, these issues are bound to be fiercely contested in the months
ahead.

[One area of international law]{.underline} that [is]{.underline} not
contested, at least not by the United States, is [the strict
[prohibition against]{.mark} the production, stockpiling, and use of
**[chemical weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} and their precursors, as set
forth in the U.N. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).\[7\] Ratified in
1997 by the U.S. Senate after intense debate, the CWC and its
implementation arm, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons (OPCW), headquartered in The Hague, is the only legally binding
instrument to ban comprehensively an entire class of weapons of mass
destruction under international verification. More importantly, it has
established a process in which the vast majority of states have declared
their chemical weapons stockpiles for the purpose of their destruction
under international monitoring. [The]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline}, which hold
the largest amount of such weapons, have [committed to destroy their
holdings]{.underline} completely by December 2020 and September 2023,
respectively. The task of ridding the world of these reprehensible
weapons will not be complete, however, until states outside the
convention, like North Korea, are brought to heel. Even more
[challenging]{.underline}, as OPCW Director General Ahmet Üzümcü warned
in his remarks at Brookings in April 2015, [is stopping
terrorists]{.underline} [and]{.underline} other [rogue
actors]{.underline} [from using chemical weapons to attack U.S. troops
and innocent civilians, as seen in Iraq and Syria in
2016.\[8\]]{.underline}

In addition to the overwhelming international consensus to stop the use
of chemical weapons, recent events in Syria have demonstrated the
operational value of such binding commitments. After reports of chemical
weapons attacks against Syrians were tragically confirmed in August 2013
when an estimated 1,500 people died from a sarin nerve gas attack in
Ghouta, the treaty was quickly put to work. In short order, a U.N.
investigation confirmed the use of chemical weapons, Syria submitted its
instrument of accession to the CWC, and Russia and the United States
agreed on a framework for the elimination of the Bashar Assad regime's
chemical weapons program. The OPCW then fast-tracked approval of a plan
to eliminate the weapons, which the Security Council endorsed the same
day.\[9\] Three days later, OPCW experts were on the ground in Damascus
to help verify Syria's stockpile of approximately 1,300 metric tons of
chemical weapons and oversee their destruction. As further elaborated by
Director General Üzümcüin his speech at Brookings, a remarkable
multilateral response involving contributions from 35 OPCW member states
led ultimately to the removal and destruction of all of Syria's declared
chemical weapons by January 2016.

Unfortunately, the story does not end there. Reports of new attacks in
Syria, this time with chlorine agents, emerged in 2015 and led to
further U.N. investigations, spurring additional U.N. Security Council
proposals by the United States and others to hold perpetrators
accountable. This time, however, U.S.-Russia cooperation had evaporated,
leading to a joint Russia-China veto of a U.N. Security Council
resolution in February 2017 that would have imposed sanctions under
Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter on Syrian government officials and
entities linked to chemical weapons attacks; placed an embargo on arms
sales and chemicals intended to be used as weapons; and established a
mechanism to monitor implementation.\[10\]

[The lessons learned from]{.underline} the [Syria]{.underline} case
[about the realities of]{.underline} [international law]{.underline} and
politics [are manifold: (1) establish clear rules of the road and
mechanisms for implementation before a crisis hits; (2) move quickly on
windows of opportunity when they arise; and (3) fortify the political
will among major powers to ensure concrete action]{.underline}.\[11\]
The CWC worked well when all three factors were present, and fell short
when the third element dried up. Consensus broke down in part because of
the demand for punishment of specific government officials and agencies,
a step apparently too far for Syria's chief defenders on the Security
Council. On balance, the CWC and its quick implementation in the Syria
case certainly advanced U.S. national security interests in containing
the spread of chemical weapons in a volatile part of the world. But [the
[current **lack of accountability**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for blatant
violations raises]{.mark} serious [questions about the **deterrent
value** of the instrument.]{.mark}]{.underline}

While chemical weapons were prevalent over a century ago, [**[new
forms]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[warfare]{.underline}** [are
emerging that test]{.underline}]{.mark} [the boundaries of national and
[international laws]{.mark} rooted in core principles of necessity,
proportionality, reciprocity, and human rights]{.underline}. [The
[absence of]{.mark} specific [rules that govern]{.mark} the [use of new
technologies]{.mark} [like]{.mark}]{.underline} armed drones and
**[offensive [cyber weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[requires
policymakers]{.mark} and lawyers,]{.underline} in Harold Koh's view,
[[to "translate]{.mark} what Montesquieu called '[the spirit of the
laws' to **present day situations**]{.mark}]{.underline}," at least
until paralyzed legislatures are able to write new laws.\[12\] Under the
administration of President Obama, decisionmakers looked both to
international and U.S. law for proper authority and guidance on how to
engage in non-traditional armed conflict between a state and a
transnational terrorist network like al-Qaida. These rules included
humane treatment of combatants and noncombatants,\[13\] as well as the
strict prohibition of torture in all places and at all times with no
exceptions.\[14\] Targeted killings were considered permissible if in
accordance with international humanitarian law (e.g., in situations of
imminent threat, an act of self-defense, or an armed conflict where a
combatant has no immunity), if the action was authorized under domestic
and international law, and if the target's rights have been considered
and sovereignty of the relevant nation respected.

Next month, countries will meet in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, to begin
mapping out what such a plan would like. Palmer hopes that a final
version will be formalized in Beijing in 2020.

If a binding global treaty fails to materialize, then humanity faces an
uncertain future, she said. Past efforts to stop the loss of
biodiversity have not proved successful, according to the Guardian.

In recent years, evidence of this staggering loss has begun
accumulating.

[Wild animal populations have declined by 60% since 1970, more than
26,000 plants and animals are close to extinction, nearly two-thirds of
the world's wetlands and half of all rainforests have been destroyed,
more than 87% of the world's ocean area is dying, and the planet needs
an estimated 5 million years to recover from the biodiversity loss it
has already sustained.]{.underline}

"[We are sleepwalking towards the edge of a cliff,"]{.underline} Mike
Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF, recently
told the Guardian. "If there was a 60% decline in the human population,
that would be equivalent to emptying North America, South America,
Africa, Europe, China, and Oceania. That is the scale of what we have
done."

["This is far more than just being about losing the wonders of
nature]{.underline}, desperately sad though that is," he said. ["[This
is]{.mark} actually now [jeopardising the future of people.
Nature]{.mark} is not a 'nice to have' --- it [is our **life-support
system**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[The [benefits of biod]{.mark}iversity are hard to overstate. [The
**food chain**, **climate systems**]{.mark}, atmospheric conditions,
**[natural resources]{.mark}**, and much more [depend on]{.mark} the
delicately structured interactions of [ecosystems]{.mark} around the
world.]{.underline}

[The truly wild places in the world, meanwhile, are [crucial to
generating, cleaning]{.mark}, and [distributing water]{.mark} around the
world, and [could help]{.mark} to [**mitigate the looming water
crisis**.]{.mark} These landscapes and marine environments also [clean
the air and act as **carbon sinks**, stabilize the global environment,
and protect countries from **natural disasters**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In addition to climate change, [[the biggest threats]{.mark} to
biodiversity are deforestation]{.underline}, agriculture,
over-development, [and **[industrial pollution]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

While Palmer sounded an urgent alarm bell while speaking with the
Guardian, she's hopeful that countries will recognize the threat of
biodiversity loss and begin to take action.

The UN is calling for at least 30% of all land and 15% of all marine
environments to be protected by 2030 and for targets to be lifted in the
following years.

"Things are moving. There is a lot of goodwill," Palmer said. "We should
be aware of the dangers but not paralysed by inaction. [[It's still in
our hands but the window]{.mark} for action [is
narrowing]{.mark}.]{.underline} We need higher levels of political and
citizen will to support nature."

#### Pollution causes extinction

Baskut **Tuncak 19**, Special Rapporteur on the implications for human
rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous
substances and wastes, "Toxic pollution: Another extinction crisis
looms, warns UN expert",
https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25201&LangID=E

NEW YORK (24 October 2019) -- [Under [the]{.mark} shadow of]{.underline}
the [**[existential threats]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
climate change and [biodiversity collapse lies another, insidious
**extinction crisis**]{.underline}: [the **toxification** of our planet
and our bodies,]{.underline} a UN human rights expert told the General
Assembly today.

"Our [incessant exposure to [pollution]{.mark} and other sources of
toxic substances [poses a global threat]{.mark} to human rights,
including to our right to reproductive health," said the UN Special
Rapporteur on hazardous substances and wastes, Baskut Tuncak, as he
called on States to recognise and uphold their duty to prevent exposure
to hazardous substances.]{.underline}

He said that when viewed through the lens of children's and reproductive
health, the importance and gravity of preventing exposure to toxic
substances at the outset sharpens further into focus. [[Declining
fertility, including declining sperm quality and]{.mark} [quantity, is
only one of many worrying health trends]{.mark} linked to toxic
exposure]{.underline} that persist because States have not truly
prioritised exposure prevention.

"Every State has binding human rights obligations that create a duty to
take active measures to prevent the exposure of individuals and
communities to toxic substances. Nonetheless, people and peoples are
knowingly exposed to a multitude of hazardous substances that could be
prevented. Relief and remedy, to the limited extent it materialises, is
often insufficient and too late for those who are exposed."

Tuncak's report reminds States of their duty to prevent exposure to
toxics in the context of the rights to life, health, dignity and bodily
integrity. It is increasingly demonstrated that "safe" levels of
exposure for many toxic substances are presumed, and for many there is
no safe level of exposure.

"There is a danger that the human rights to safe water, adequate food
and housing, clean air, a healthy environment and safe and healthy work,
among others, will be a false promise and never truly realised without
concerted efforts to make exposure prevention an urgent priority," said
Tuncak.

Tuncak stressed that [[this]{.underline} **["toxic
cocktail"]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[pollution]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [conservatively [calculated as the single
largest source of **premature death**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the world,
[and [it]{.mark} causes and [contributes to a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**["silent pandemic"]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[diseases]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[and]{.underline}
**[disabilities]{.underline}**]{.mark}. "We can no longer see the
problem substance-by-substance -- but rather must address the combined
effect of a multitude of chronic exposures, particularly on those that
are most vulnerable, such as children, workers, different genders and
people living in poverty," he said.

#### Squo doesn't solve norms\-\--AFF key

Charlie **Dunlap 17**, former deputy judge advocate general of the
United States Air Force, joined the Duke Law faculty in July 2010 where
he is a professor of the practice of law and Executive Director of the
Center on Law, Ethics and National Security, "[[Are cyber norms]{.mark}
[as to what constitutes]{.mark} an "act of [war]{.mark}"
[developing]{.mark} as we would want?,"]{.underline} Lawfire, 9/15/17,
https://sites.duke.edu/lawfire/2017/09/15/are-cyber-norms-as-to-what-constitutes-an-act-of-war-developing-as-we-would-want/

[**[Ironically]{.underline}**, [there has been]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
lot of [work]{.mark} done [to help nations **work
through**]{.mark}]{.underline} [the [law regarding cyber
incidents]{.mark}. For example, the NATO-sponsored Tallinn 2.0 Manual
provides]{.underline} superb **[guidance]{.underline}** [as to the
**current state of the law**]{.underline} [vis-à-vis cyber
operatiions]{.underline} (albeit it is not an official NATO document.)
Chapter XVI of the DoD Law of War Manual also provides -- at least for
DoD -- some broad guidance as to the law applicable to cyber operations.

[[The devil]{.mark}, of course[, is **in the
details**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [and those **details** involve
**determining**]{.underline} [what facts are appropriately applied to
the law]{.underline}. [It is here where **uncertainty**]{.underline}
[frequently]{.underline} [exists]{.underline}. [For example, last June,
[NATO]{.mark} [Chief]{.mark}]{.underline} Jan [Stoltenberg
[announced]{.mark} that [a **"severe"** cyber-attack **might
trigger**]{.mark} NATO's [Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline} "collective
self-defense" authority, [[but it]{.mark} still **[isn't clear what
"severe" would mean]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to decision-makers in
a]{.mark} **[particular]{.mark} factual
[circumstance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Given the importance of state practice in the development of norms, VADM
Tighe's comments are apropos. In speaking to some National Security
Council experts yesterday afternoon, I argued (along the lines of my
prior Lawfire blog) that [it is extremely [important for the U.S. to
**characterize** cyber incidents]{.mark} for what they really
are]{.underline} (at least from the U.S. perspective. If they amount to
unlawful uses of force that violate the UN Charter and permit a
self-defense response under Article 51 of the Charter, we should say so.
(N.B. The U.S. takes an expansive view of what would trigger
self-defense authority -- see Chapter XVII of the DoD Law of War Manual
and former Legal Advisor to the State Department Harold Koh's 2012
remarks, and the critique of them here ).

Importantly, [an official characterization of a particular cyber
incident as a "use of force" or "armed attack"]{.underline} (UN Charter
terms) -- [or even the colloquial "act of war" (]{.underline}again, a
political term, not legal one) -- [does not mandate a particular
response, but doing so would nevertheless serve [to **help advance
international norms**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of course, like everything
else, there are potential downsides. In a very thoughtful article,
Hofstra professor Julian Ku discusses the "restrictivist" view that
China takes with respect to the use of force generally, and opines that
it may not be in the U.S.'s interest to force China to accept the U.S.
interpretations of international law restrictions as to cyber warfare
because of the potential of China applying them pejoratively to U.S.
actions in other contexts.

### Yes Model\-\--China

#### NATO's failure to respond to Russia's hybrid warfare [legitimizes China]{.underline}

Sascha Dominik (Dov) **Bachmann et al 19**, Professor, Canberra Law
School, "Competition short of war -- how Russia's hybrid and grey-zone
warfare are a blueprint for China's global power ambitions ," Australian
Journal of Defence and Strategic Studies Vol. 1 No. 1, November 2019,
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3483981

[Russia and China have been **working hard**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} **[end]{.underline}** [the **unipolar
order**]{.underline} [of the US, which has dominated global
politics]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War and the implosion of
the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact in 1991. It has to be acknowledged
that a multi-polar world order, with China and Russia competing with the
US for global influence and power, is the reality of today's global
world affairs. Australia has to recognise this reality in order to not
fall into the trap of blindly following the US's present attempts to
counter and/or reverse the threats to its waning unipolar status as sole
superpower without too much concern regarding its allies.

[[China and Russia have acted]{.mark} **illegally**]{.underline} [[in
**violation** of **i**]{.mark}**nternational [law]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline} **[aggressively]{.underline}**]{.mark} in [both
instances: China in regard to the South China Sea and Russia in regard
to Crimea and Ukraine. Both actors]{.underline} seem to have
[[identified]{.mark} the **[unwillingness]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline} **[inability]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of the West [to
**counter their actions**]{.mark} **[effectively]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In Europe, no one wants to risk war over Russia's aggression in Ukraine.
In the Asia--Pacific context, ASEAN countries, wedged between the giants
India and China, in the South China Sea, are in much the same situation.
[[Neither]{.mark} China nor Russia [expect]{.mark} any [**military
response** from NATO or]{.mark} an [ASEAN]{.mark} country]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} so [continue to use **hybrid
warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline} **[greyzone
tactics]{.underline}** [to **erode**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**further**
the international systems of comity and the **[rule of
law]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This leads to **erosion**]{.underline}
[within the affected societies and political systems]{.underline}, as
the indecisiveness within the EU to continue with sanctions against
Russia highlights.79

[[There is **growing Sino-Russian coop**]{.mark}**eration** across
nearly all domains and sectors of interest]{.underline} and potential
risk for Australia. [From economic ties]{.underline} (China is Russia's
second largest trading partner) [to technical collaborations in respect
to the internet of things]{.underline} including 5G infrastructure, [and
now the explicit expression of the intent to 'develop]{.underline}
[bilateral cooperation]{.underline}, in the spirit of comprehensive
partnership and strategic interaction',80 Sino-Russian cooperation
increases.

[It seems only **logical**]{.underline} [that [China is **following
Russia's successful**]{.mark} **[use of hybrid
warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[as 'it **reduces the need** for]{.mark}
using **[classical military resources]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[providing]{.mark} them with a **shield** of **[plausible
deniability']{.mark}**]{.underline}.81 [[With the **backdrop of Europe's
failure**]{.underline}]{.mark} to call out Russia for its aggression in
Ukraine, [[Russia's hybrid warfare **strategy** ]{.mark}**seems to have
[worked]{.mark}** so far]{.underline}. [**Arguably**, China's strategy
in the South China Sea also seems to be working. Terraforming the
maritime environment as undertaken by Russia and China is]{.underline}
**[illegal]{.underline}** [under international law and constitutes the
use of force or the threat of such]{.underline}. [The fact that Russia
and China **successfully managed to get away**]{.underline} [with such
**illegal** and **aggressive** behaviour is **reprehensible** and
constitutes a **clear** and **present threat**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [international comity and security.]{.underline}

[The threats posed by contemporary adversaries]{.underline} (both state
and nonstate actors) [in employing hybrid and [grey-zone tactics
poses]{.mark} an **increasing [threat]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
Australia's security and **[[global stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
the years to come; [accordingly]{.underline} [the identification of such
threats and the **[planning of]{.mark} countermeasures**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [**[contingencies]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[meet these threats]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[paramount]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Whether [such an approach is [based
on a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[doctrinal approach]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[of hybrid warfare as understood [in]{.mark} the
**[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} and Western [context]{.underline}, the
use of greyzone counter-tactics or a yet-to-be developed doctrine is
academic, so long as the response is comprehensive and multimodal,
drawing from the full spectrum of military and civil resilience.

### Yes Model\-\--Turkey

#### Turkey's actions are symptomatic of a turn to [gunboat diplomacy]{.underline}

İlhan **Uzgel 20**, professor in the department of international
relations at Ankara University, "[The [rise of Turkey's]{.mark}
**[gunboat diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Duvar English, 1/6/20,
https://www.duvarenglish.com/columns/2020/01/06/the-rise-of-turkeys-gunboat-diplomacy/

[The [Erdoğan]{.mark} government [has been taking Turkey **from one
crisis to another**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[opening]{.mark} up **[new
military]{.mark} and diplomatic [fronts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
government's [decision to send troops to]{.mark} support the Government
of National Accord in [Libya]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} its [prior [acceptance]{.mark} [that
these]{.mark} forces [can be engaged in]{.mark} actual [conflicts, is
the **most risky military adventure**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the AKP
**has ever taken.**]{.underline}]{.mark} It seems that both the
[government and the pro-AKP [circles do **not seem**]{.mark} **to be
[aware of]{.mark} the [risks]{.mark}**]{.underline} [they]{.underline}
[have taken]{.underline} in such an overseas military engagement which
would be conducted in a hostile environment, against a multitude of
adversaries and two thousand km away from the mainland.

Putting aside the risks it contains, [the [decision to engage
militarily]{.mark} directly in the Libyan civil conflict [is]{.mark}
also [**symptomatic of a trend** in]{.mark} recent [Turkish foreign
policy]{.mark}]{.underline} [[which has]{.mark}
[become]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[militarized]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to
a great extent. Currently, Turkish air]{.underline} [force is
[pondering]{.mark} the [PKK sites in]{.mark} northern [Iraq]{.mark},
Turkish land [forces made]{.mark} three [incursions in]{.mark} northern
[Syria]{.mark} and controlling the Idlib area with its observation
posts, and has been [engaged in]{.mark} the not so secret [arms
procurement to]{.mark} the radical Islamist [groups in
Libya]{.mark}]{.underline} which turned into a deeper engagement in
armed drone war over the Libyan airspace. This last authorization of
dispatching Turkish troops to Libya would cover air, land forces and the
navy which means a full-scale military engagement that is unprecedented
in Turkey's history except the military operation in Cyprus in 1974. It
is important to examine the reasons behind this evolving militarization
of Turkish foreign policy in regional issues and crises. There seems to
be three intertwined reasons which forced the AKP government to resort
to the military force in dealing with the security issues, many of which
it directly contributed to emerge.

[The infrastructure for human]{.underline}
[**[civilization]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark} undeniably
tangible (that is, physical, chemical, and biological), but it is
**[increasingly [virtual]{.mark}]{.underline}** as well,
[and]{.underline} the virtual aspects of that infrastructure -- [the
**[info]{.mark}rmation ecosystem**]{.underline} (or, equivalently,
environment) -- in many ways [has [become]{.mark}
**central**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} often
[**[critical]{.underline}** [to the way people]{.underline}]{.mark} now
**[[live]{.underline}]{.mark}** all over the world.

As Balkin (2012) describes, "it is not an exaggeration to say that
[modern states are **informational**]{.underline} [states:
states]{.underline} that **[recognize]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[solve problems of governance]{.underline}** [by collecting,
analyzing, and distributing **information**]{.underline}." Consider that
nations require good information to allocate benefits and social
services to the populace; to administer mechanisms for public safety
(e.g. law enforcement, court systems, fire-fighting); to provide for
national security; to gather revenue to support national expenditures;
and to engage with other nations in ways that support national
interests.

Businesses and nonprofit entities in turn are also highly dependent on
information. They use it to develop products and services for customers
and clients; to understand markets and audiences for their products and
services; to inform customers and clients about their products and
services; to comply with laws and regulations applicable to their
products and services; and to maintain their accounting and finances.
Construction and manufacturing projects entail the coordination of
dozens, hundreds, or thousands of parties -- all of whom must have a
justifiable confidence in the information they are sharing and relying
upon.

Contextualized, reliable, trustworthy information is as important to the
thinking of human beings as clean air is to human breathing. Human
beings depend on good information for making informed decisions about
political candidates standing in elections; to know as consumers which
specific products and services will best serve their needs; for managing
their finances; in making health-related decisions about themselves and
their loved ones; in learning to perform their jobs more effectively or
efficiently; and in truly countless other ways.

Nations also engage extensively in information production. They provide
education for young people; support scientific research that undergirds
economic growth and prosperity; and collect, curate, and disseminate
large-scale statistical data that influence decisions at every level of
society.

Imagine what life would be like [[if citizens could not count on]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[validity]{.underline}** and trustworthiness
[of]{.underline} the **[[info]{.underline}]{.mark}**rmation underlying
any of these activities. In some cases, the result would be no more than
minor annoyance. In others, however, [the result [could
be]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**life-threatening**]{.mark}. [Nations]{.mark}
could]{.underline} be crippled, as they could [and]{.underline}
**[likely [would]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[make]{.underline}

**[[energy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and]{.underline} the **[many other
important matters]{.underline}** [for which governments
have]{.underline} some [responsibility]{.underline}.

On the existential threat from cyber-enabled information warfare

[Corruption of the]{.underline} **[information ecosystem]{.underline}**
[has become [an]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[existential threat to
civilization]{.underline}**]{.mark} as we know it because prosperity and
advancement depend on a secure information infrastructure and
environment that provides human beings with contextualized, reliable,
trustworthy information when and where it is needed. Information is as
much a part of human ecology and the essence of being human as DNA
(itself a form of information!) is a part of the evolutionary processes
in biological systems.

[Today,]{.underline} [**[chaos]{.underline}**
[reigns]{.underline}]{.mark} in much of the information ecosystem on
which societies depend. In many forums for political and societal
discourse, national leaders shout about **[[fake
news]{.underline}]{.mark}**, by which they mean information they do not
like. These same leaders lie shamelessly, calling their lies truth, or
perhaps "truthful hyperbole." Acting [[across]{.underline} **[national
boundaries]{.underline}**]{.mark}, these leaders and their surrogates
[[exacerbate]{.underline}]{.mark} existing
**[[divisions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [creating]{.underline}
**[rage]{.underline}** [and [diminishing]{.mark} confidence
in]{.underline} [**[elections]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[democratic [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Using unsupported
anecdotes and sketchy rhetoric, denialists
[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark} well-established
[**[science]{.underline}** [about]{.underline}
**[climate]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[change]{.underline}** and other
urgent issues. [Established]{.underline} **[institutions]{.underline}**
of the government, journalism, and education -- institutions that have
traditionally provided stability -- [are]{.underline} **[under
attack]{.underline}** precisely because they have provided stability.

The founding of the Bulletin predates by several decades the widespread
availability of computers, the Internet, smart phones, search engines,
and social media. Few could imagine in 1945 a technological environment
that affords today's high-speed and widespread connectivity, high
degrees of anonymity, insensitivity to distance and national borders,
easy and customized information searches, democratized access to
publishing capabilities, inexpensive production and consumption of
information content (including and increasingly importantly emotionally
evocative video and audio content), disintermediation of established
information sources, and ubiquitous, always-on, always-available access
to information sources through mobile devices.

Such advances in information technology have heralded the arrival of the
information age, a world in which taking near-immediate advantage of
information opens up enormous opportunities in both the private and
public sectors for improved delivery of existing products and services
and, perhaps more important, the creation of entirely new products and
services. Products and services can be customized to individual needs
and preferences on a large scale and at more affordable costs.
Transactional friction can be tremendously reduced. Through the Internet
of Things, actuators and sensors can be connected to process control
computers to optimize the behavior and function of physical systems.
Everywhere that information can be used to create and improve new and
existing functionality (that is, essentially everywhere), one can find
or imagine new information technologies to do so.

At the same time, advances in information technology have a dark side.
The same increases in the volume and velocity of information have
created a louder and more chaotic information environment that
stimulates fast, angry, reflexive, intuitive, and visceral thinking,
reaction, and action in people and thus displaces more complex,
reflective, and rational thought. In a chaotic environment of
information overload, people are more likely to use mental shortcuts as
a way to reduce the cognitive burden that such an environment places on
their thinking.

In recent years, we have seen how the Internet, social media, and mobile
devices (and other technologies) can be used by foreign adversaries to
interfere in elections and to disrupt the democratic process. We have
seen:

Is this state of information affairs really new? Haven't adversaries of
all stripes always employed propaganda and lies -- otherwise known as
information warfare (or at least a big part of it) -- to advance their
interests?

Yes. [Information warfare]{.underline} indeed [has a]{.underline}
**[long pedigree]{.underline}** that reaches into the past for at least
the three millennia since the Trojan Horse enabled Greek warriors to
breach the walls around the city of Troy. Much more recently, the rise
of the Nazi regime in Germany relied on propaganda. As Hitler (1925,
155--56) wrote:

> \[I\]ts purpose must be ... to attract the attention of the masses and
> not by any means to dispense individual instructions to those who
> already have an educated opinion on things or who wish to form such an
> opinion on grounds of objective study -- because that is not the

[But more so]{.underline} **[today]{.underline}** [than at]{.underline}
**[any]{.underline}** earlier **[point]{.underline}** in human history,
[human beings are]{.underline} **[vulnerable]{.underline}** to
information warfare. At the same time that new information technologies
have led to an increase in the volume and velocity of information
available on Earth by many orders of magnitude in the past few decades,
the cognitive architecture of the human mind is more or less unchanged
on the time scale of centuries or even millennia.

On human cognition

Research in the fields of cognitive and social psychology has formalized
what Hitler knew intuitively. We now understand that human cognitive
processing capability is not unlimited; humans have finite cognitive
resources that can be "used up" under mentally stressful circumstances.
Findings from the same cognitive psychology that has transformed
neoclassical economics into behavioral economics (and resulted in three
Nobel Prizes in economics) have made clear the "bounded rationality" of
human thought and the simultaneous existence in every individual of the
capability to engage in two types of cognitive processing.

Specifically, heuristic dual-system cognitive theory posits that human
beings have two systems for cognitive processing -- an intuitive,
reflexive, and emotionally driven mode of thought (often designated as
System 1) and a slower, more deliberate, analytical mode of thought
(often designated as System 2). Kahneman (2011) provides a primer on
System 1 and System 2 thinking. (See Petty and Cacioppo 1986; Chaiken
1987 for other variants of dual-system cognitive theory; see Kruglanski
and Thompson 1999 for a contrary view on dual-system cognitive theory.)

System 1 is designed to operate rapidly, but it can do so because it
does not take account of all available information and is thus more
prone to error (also called bias). System 2 operates more slowly but is
more likely to take into account the available information and is less
prone to error. People engaging in System 1 information processing
respond more emotionally and less rationally or critically than in
System 2 processing.

Most important, System 1 thinking is the default mode of thought for
human beings -- it uses smaller amounts of cognitive resources, relies
on simple gut-based judgments, and is used more often when humans are
under stress. For most situations encountered in everyday life, System 1
thinking is adequate and produces mostly valid and useful outcomes, but
it often fails when a situation requires complex inferences for
understanding. For such situations, System 2 thinking, which is
effortful and consumptive of cognitive resources, is more often
appropriate -- and when individuals fail to use System 2 when it is
appropriate to do so, they are easily misled.

Most individuals are capable of both System 1 and System 2 thinking;
thus, the important operative question is the circumstances under which
they select one or the other type of thinking. Psychology has
accumulated considerable evidence relevant to this question.

For example, Taber and Lodge (2006) show that an individual tends to be
less critical of information that is favorable to his or her position
than of information that is not favorable -- that is, he or she is more
likely to engage in System 1 thinking for favorable information. People
have a confirmation bias in their information seeking and processing
behavior -- they preferentially seek out information that is consistent
with their beliefs and they are highly critical of (or ignore)
information that contradicts their beliefs. In a meta-analysis of 91
studies, Hart et al. (2009) considered two motivations for how an
individual might select information to consume -- the desire to gain an
accurate understanding of reality and the desire to feel validated in
his or her beliefs. These two motivations conflict when an accurate
understanding of reality does not validate one's beliefs, and such a
situation motivates the question of which of these motivations is more
powerful. Hart et al. concluded that both motivations drive human
information-seeking behavior, thus moderating each other to a certain
extent, but that on balance, humans do exhibit a tendency towards the
validation of their beliefs. People are also subject to belief
perseverance (a.k.a. a continuing influence effect) -- a cognitive bias
through which individuals do not revise beliefs based on erroneous
information even when they know for sure that such information is
erroneous (Lewandowsky et al. 2012).

Maintenance of an individual's social identity is an important influence
on his or her invocation of System 1 or System 2 thinking. Evidence
suggests that individuals tend to adopt the views of the peer groups
that are most salient to them, even if the "objective" or "factual"
information available to them contradicts those views. (Asch 1951
performed the classic "conformity experiments" that demonstrated this
phenomenon in the early 1950s.) Uncritical System 1 thinking is active
in processing information that is consonant with the beliefs and
attitudes of those peer groups. Critical and skeptical System 2 thinking
is active in processing information that is dissonant to those groups'
beliefs. These effects (that individuals tend to accept salient group
norms) are even more pronounced in an anonymous environment, such as
that which characterizes much online interaction (Postmes et al. 2001).

Lastly, there is evidence that emotion and motivation affect cognition.
For example, people who are angry tend to rely more heavily on simple
heuristic cues (suggestive of System 1 thinking) than those who are not
angry (Bodenhausen, Sheppard, and Kramer 1994). Individuals are more
likely to stereotype people (a form of System 1 thinking) when that
stereotype is consistent with their desired impression of those people;
conversely, when the stereotype is inconsistent with their desired
impression, individuals tend to inhibit the use of this stereotype
(Kunda and Sinclair 1999). Negative emotions (such as those induced by
the receipt of information incongruent with a person's prior beliefs)
can improve the ability of a person to reason logically, thus enabling
him or her to negate or discount that information (Goel and Vartanian
2011).

In the new information environment, exploitation of human cognitive
architecture and capabilities -- which are largely unchanged from what
existed millennia ago -- provides the 21st century information warrior
with cyber-enabled capabilities that Hitler, Stalin, Goebbels, and
McCarthy could have only imagined. By exploiting cognitive limitations,
the perpetrators of cyber-enabled information warfare have learned to
exacerbate prejudices, biases, and ideological differences; to add heat
but no light to political discourse; and to spread widely believed
"alternative facts" in advancing their political positions.

Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election has dominated
news headlines ever since. But interference by authoritarian countries
in the elections of democratic states -- as undesirable and threatening
as it may be -- is hardly the only negative consequence of cyber-enabled
information warfare. The problems of nuclear war and climate change are
hard enough to solve even when well-intentioned, well-informed parties
on all sides share a basic understanding and knowledge of the relevant
facts. Yes, they may have different values and different priorities, may
act under different constraints, and be able to bring to bear different
levels of resources to these problems.

But without shared, fact-based understandings of the blast, thermal, and
radiation effects of nuclear explosions, what hope is there for national
leaders to reach agreements to reduce the threat of nuclear holocaust or
to make good decisions about nuclear weapons use in times of crisis?
Without shared, fact-based understandings that rising atmospheric carbon
dioxide concentrations caused by human beings result in corresponding
increases in global temperature and climatic disruption, what hope is
there for national leaders to reach agreements to begin serious efforts
at decarbonizing their economies?

Climate change denialism

Climate change denialism can be fairly characterized as cyber-enabled
information warfare against the reality of large-scale
anthropogenically-induced climate change. In the responses of people
resistant to taking action to mitigate climate change, we see a number
of psychological factors at work (Zaval and Cornwell 2016). For example,
one key element of System 1 thinking is the availability heuristic, with
which individuals tend to associate the likelihood of an event with the
ease with which they can remember similar events in the past. But the
long-term consequences of climate change are unprecedented in recorded
human history and obviously people have no personal memories of
unprecedented events.

Moreover, climate change is a long-term process whose inexorable
progression is easily masked by short-term fluctuations in local weather
conditions. For example, public concerns about climate changes correlate
with local weather conditions (Krosnick et al. 2006). Climate change
deniers are also quick to flag for public attention days that are
particularly cold as "evidence" that global warming is not occurring and
thus, they claim, discrediting theories of climate change. This
illustrates a bias known as attribute substitution, as Kahneman and
Frederick (2002) describe, through which individuals substitute salient
information (such as the cold temperature today) for information that is
more relevant but harder to understand (such as information about global
climate change).

People are also subject to a loss-aversion bias, in which they place
greater weight on losses than gains of equal value. In 1992, the United
States committed itself to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change, although President George HW Bush also stated that "the
American way of life is not up for negotiation" -- and in 2018, the
United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement (which was based on the
convention). The argument? That the United States would have to give up
too much if it kept to the agreement.

To close this (merely illustrative) exploration of biases relevant to
climate change denialism, the optimism bias suggests that people
consider themselves exceptions when considering the likelihood of a
negative event occurring. That is, bad things may happen to other
people, but they won't happen to me, even though I and those other
people are similar in important and relevant ways. In a climate context,
the bad things may involve sea level rise or heat waves -- and the
misperception that "others may suffer from such problems but I won't"
diminishes the power of personal concern as a driver for rational
decision making.

Connecting the operation of these cognitive biases to the affordances of
modern information technologies is not difficult. For example, Roxburgh
et al. (2019) demonstrate how the characteristics of specific weather
events (e.g. hurricanes or snowstorms) and "short-term socio-political
context can play a critical role in determining the lenses through which
climate change is viewed." Note especially the importance of "short-term
socio-political context" -- precisely the context that social media
shapes.

Elsasser and Dunlap (2013) noted the influential role of a variety of
newspaper columnists in advancing denialist arguments and thus
amplifying these arguments to a broad segment of the American public.
Fewer in number then, essentially all columnists today (of all political
leanings) have a social media presence that they use to publicize their
work, and in many instances their online presence is driven in
significant part by social media and reach many more readers online than
in print. Furthermore, subtleties and nuances in their extended written
pieces are likely to be lost when they are represented in social media.

Another important element of climate change denialism is the easy
accessibility of seemingly-authoritative information that casts doubt on
the well-established science of climate change. As reported by The
Guardian, a variety of largely secret funding sources distributed \$118
million to 102 denialist organizations (Goldenberg 2013). Oreskes and
Conway (2011) provide the definitive work on deliberate information
campaigns to obscure the scientific truth on a range of issues from
smoking to climate change. These denialist organizations have generated
a variety of products for public and policy consumption (but --
unsurprisingly -- not many peer-reviewed scientific articles) that are
easily accessible to the public, mainstream media outlets, and policy
makers. Their products are broadly disseminated through social media and
easily found through customized search, and they are sought by reporters
who seeking to cover "both sides" of a controversy that is
intellectually equivalent to a "controversy" about whether the earth is
round or flat.

Nuclear conflict

On the risks of nuclear conflict, theories and approaches to **[[nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** and strategic stability developed
prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980's and early
1990's [[rest on]{.mark} the presumption of]{.underline}
**[[rationality]{.underline}]{.mark}** in national decision makers. In
particular, they assume that adversaries are deterred from attacking by
a threat of retaliation that would impose costs on the adversary that
would outweigh any conceivable benefits that it would gain from an
attack (Morgan 2003). [Central to this]{.underline} assumption [is a
rational adversary that **can**]{.underline} and does [make a
calculation of expected costs and benefits, compares them, and then acts
accordingly]{.underline}.

But the psychologically informed understanding of real-world decision
making described above was not accepted widely in the scientific
literature until approximately the same time as the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and the seminal work in such understanding occurred only
in the decade previous to that. What a psychologically-informed
understanding of real-world decision making tells us is that the
rationality assumption at the base of much traditional thinking on
deterrence and strategic stability is untenable, given that humans have
evolved to rely on intuitive, reflexive, heuristic System 1 thinking to
make decisions, particularly when faced with time pressures, surprise
and other obstacles to the deliberate calculation implied by System 2
thinking (Kahneman 2011). Psychology tells us that -- more often than
not -- the fast, intuitive judgements of System 1 often take precedence
over the slower, more analytical thinking of System 2.

The challenges posed by reflexive reliance on System 1 thinking are
greatly accentuated by characteristics of today's information
environment. Social media networks in particular are optimally designed
to stimulate System 1 thinking -- emotional, reflexive, immediate -- and
they rapidly transmit content among like-minded individuals, creating
the ideal conditions for public polarization and divisiveness to occur
(Pfeffer, Zorbach, and Carley 2014). Multiple narratives rapidly emerge
around complex events; citizens splinter into their own informational
universes and are unable to agree on an underlying reality. Political
leaders themselves are subject to these conflicting narratives and may
even be active and influential participants in one or another of them.

It is thus easy to posit that [in this]{.underline} **[information
environment]{.underline}**, [**[manipulated]{.underline}**
[info]{.underline}]{.mark}[rmation -- either]{.underline}
**[artificially constructed]{.underline}** [or adopted by a]{.underline}
**[strong grassroots]{.underline}** base -- [[could]{.mark} be used
by]{.underline} **[interested parties]{.underline}** [to
[generate]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[pressure]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[on]{.underline} **[leaders]{.underline}** to act. At the same time,
leaders themselves are likely to be facing information overload and less
able to distinguish analyzed information from their own intelligence
sources and other, unvetted information originating from their
constituencies.

The coming information dystopia

**[Nuclear war]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[climate
change]{.underline}** [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} arguably the most
important **[[existential challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}** today that
are **[compounded]{.underline}** [by the]{.underline} **[corruption of
the information]{.underline}** ecosystem. [But even if a single
miraculous stroke the laws of physics were changed to make nuclear
weapons impossible to build and operate and to immediately eliminate
anthropogenic emissions at zero cost, cyber-enabled information warfare
could still can lead to an information **dystopia**]{.underline}. Here
are some possible elements:

> (complete with sound effects) committing battlefield atrocities, and
> spread them widely through the Internet. Once upon a time,
> high-quality video forgeries were difficult and expensive to make.
> AI-based technologies will bring this so-called deepfake capability to

>
> Journalists, political leaders, and judges are compromised by artfully

> indistinguishable from them.

A world with these elements -- and many more comparable ones -- will be
the inevitable result if and when deployment and use of the tools of
cyber-enabled information warfare become widespread. And even more
troubling is the fact that not every bit of information needs to be
corrupted for this dystopian outcome to occur -- it will require only a
fraction of it to be corrupted for people to lose faith entirely in
"objective" and "trustworthy" sources of information, the result of
which will be that people will fractionate into their own information
realities.

Fearing the end of the enlightenment

The Enlightenment established reason and reality as the foundational
pillars of civilized discourse. In such discourse, logic matters, and a
logical contradiction between statement A and statement B means that at
least one of those statements is false. The truth of a statement about
the world is tested by its correspondence to objective reality rather
than by how many people believe it; that is, empirical data are
influential. Furthermore, statements known to be wrong or false do not
affect conclusions or choices between alternative courses of action.

Cyber-enabled information warfare provides the tactics, tools, and
procedures -- in short, the means -- to replace the pillars of logic,
truth, and reality with fantasy, rage, and fear. In a world of
ubiquitous cyber-enabled information warfare, communication and
information inflame passions rather than informing reason, play to the
worst in people's cognitive architectures rather than the best, and
divide rather than unify. Deliberate corruption of the information
ecosystem could be seen as an analog of poisoning water supplies that
can be done remotely, inexpensively, and anonymously. All of this is
just another way of saying that today it is possible to see glimmerings
of an anti-Enlightenment that can possibly take root and [that
would]{.underline} indeed [be [the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[end of
civilization]{.underline}**]{.mark} as we know it.

Adversaries foreign and domestic that make use cyber-enabled information
warfare turn our internal cognitive processes and our external
institutional and legal processes against us. Under the cover of "fair
play" rubrics and the First Amendment, they have turned us against
ourselves. Desperately needed are ways of countering the insidious
tactics of cyber-enabled information warfare for ourselves.

How might we proceed? We need action to develop better ways of
identifying adversary cyber-enabled information warfare campaigns in
progress; good countermeasures to help human beings resist the use of
cyber-enabled information warfare operations targeted against them; and
good measures to degrade, disrupt, or expose the adversary's use of
cyber-enabled information warfare operations. All of this is easier said
than done, however, as cyber-enabled capabilities for information
warfare increase while human cognitive limitations remain the same. Our
work is cut out for us. [If we **fail**, the world is at]{.underline}
increasing [risk [of]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[large-scale]{.underline}**]{.mark} and **[long-term [societal
fracture]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the end of the Enlightenment, and the
start of an informational Dark Age.

#### It\'s the [highest magnitude]{.underline} issue.

Polarization

The Greek philosopher Herakleitos coined the phrase: "From differences
results the most beautiful harmony". Maybe he should have been somewhat
more cautious because we are biologically, psychologically and
linguistically wired to think in fragments as in most modern sciences
where we are still haunted by Cartesian divisions. We understand the
notion of "parts" better than the concept of "wholeness" because we tend
to think in fragments and not in coherent patterns. [Once we have
**fractured the world**]{.underline} into stand-alone pieces, [it is an
**illusion**]{.underline} [that simply **connecting** us]{.underline}
through advanced technologies [will create **coherence**]{.underline}.
Through [social media]{.underline} we **[connect]{.underline}** [but do
**not**]{.underline} [create]{.underline}
**[togetherness]{.underline}**. [Common]{.underline} to all the forms of
fragmentation---that I described---[is]{.underline} a mode of thinking
that William Isaacs (1999) called "**[thinking alone]{.underline}**"
which means [being]{.underline} **[defensive]{.underline}** about our
positions, [clinging to certainties and imposing judgements]{.underline}
upon others. [It reflects a **binary discourse**]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} **[categorizes]{.underline}** people against each
other. Men versus women, black versus white, impaired versus
non-impaired, religious versus non-religious. Binary thinking fosters
exclusion and discrimination. We have no shared discourse to converse
about the fractures of humanity. Against this Isaacs argues that we need
to "think together" which means listening, respecting, suspending
assumptions and letting our inner voices speak up. "Thinking alone"
fosters and feeds polarized fragmentation. The opposite poles are
immobile and entrenched in their singular identities. Once people lose
the capacity to think about themselves in terms of multiple identities,
they are ready to believe that the others deserve to be dehumanized and
eventually to be eliminated. The belief in singular identities tends to
see violence as only way to protect your own identity. [[When
fragmentation gets **polarized**]{.mark}, conflicting [parties]{.mark}
tend to **[forget]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that all have multiple
identities and that [identities are]{.mark} not static but
**[dynamic]{.mark}**]{.underline} lest we become each others' enemies.
Our identities and those of others are permanently in flow. We are
"flaneurs" as Walter Benjamin phrased it. Especially in global cities
there is a constant interaction between multiple identities and we need
to reclaim the capacity to celebrate this. The city can only survive if
we dance in the streets! There are no fixed identities; they are
constructed labels for convenient purposes such as domination.
Identities are fluid. As Kwame Appiah says in an interview with the
Financial Times (31 August 2018) "Still, whatever their religion,
sexuality, racial identity, or nationality, people should have a lighter
hand with their use of these identity categories in a way that would
mean that moments in our cultures where conflicts arise might be
somewhat defused". Essential identities do not exist however much many
people care about them and get angry when what see as their identity is
not taken sufficiently seriously. Identity can only develop in
interaction with others. Appiah, "Beginning in infancy, it is in
dialogue with other people's understandings of who I am that I develop a
conception of my own identity" (Appiah 2007, 20). As Appiah argues
identity is not an authentic inner essence but it is---in the words of
Charles Taylor---dialogically constituted. "Individuality presupposes
sociability" (ibidem, 20) since we are social beings as Aristotle
already knew. In Appiah's felicitous phrasing "so much we care about is
collectively created" (ibidem, 20). We should understand that our
individual identities have strong collective dimensions... "because they
are constituted in part by socially transmitted conceptions of how a
person of that identity properly behaves" (ibidem, 21). In processes of
polarization, the narratives about who we are tend to be narrowed down
to the stories of others who think like us and behave like we do. The
collective dimension impoverishes and the dialogical construction of our
identity allows the input of a limited set of voices only. There is
grave danger in the frozen identities to which the so-called
nationalist/populist identity politicians greatly contribute. We need to
answer this polarization of dividedness with creativity and flexibility,
with storytelling, theatre, music and dance. Once dividedness polarizes,
it paralyzes communities and stands in the way of their resilience.
[With]{.underline} **[polarization]{.underline}**, the
[**[de-escalation]{.underline}** [of conflicts
becomes]{.underline}]{.mark} [practically
**[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[because **conversation** is no
longer possible]{.mark}. Polarization confronts us with the]{.underline}
**[most dangerous of all fractures]{.underline}**. Humans have managed
to create a formidable enemy---Mother Gaia---and we need protection
against her devastating anger. A deeply polarized human species is
unable to provide this protection that needs to be based upon
togetherness, thinking together and conversing together.

Existential Risk

[The accumulation of the **fractures**]{.underline} [into]{.underline}
**[polarization]{.underline}** [[causes the **human

Risks in this category are a recent phenomenon. This is part of the
reason why it is useful to distinguish them from other risks. [[We have

ever more dangerous, and at the same time, humanity is incapacitated to
deal with such unprecedented risks as it outsources its moral
responsibilities increasingly to medical, psychotherapeutic, scientific,
nutrition and technical-engineering experts. Whereas the Enlightenment
promised to liberate humans from the selfimposed inability to use their
minds independently of others (Kant), modern life is handed over to
coaches and counsellors. [As "the most likely global catastropic risks
all seem to arise from **human** activities, especially industrial
civilization and advanced technologies]{.underline}" (Bostrom and
Cirkovi´ ´ c 2008, 27) **[humanity]{.underline}** [has the
responsibility to reflect on the]{.underline} unintended and

**urgent** in]{.underline} terms of **[human survival]{.underline}**
[are the fractures between **humans**]{.underline} [and the **Earth

in a new phase: the "anthropocene". This means that humans are with
their immense and unprecedented power the most influential force in the
evolutionary process. Interestingly enough the social sciences largely
have refused to accept that the Earth sciences can contribute to our
understanding of the world as no longer a "humans among themselves
affair" (Hamilton 2017). The "humans only" focus that prevails in the
social sciences leads to humans watching their own extinction as a
televised spectacle that takes place outside the cubicle of their daily
lives. Humans may---as the most powerful species---be at the centre of
the planet but are increasingly unable to control the planet. "Our
understanding of the Earth we inhabit is undergoing a radical change.
The modern ideas of the Earth as the environment in which humans make
their home, or as a knowable collection of ecosystems more or less
disturbed by humans, is being replaced by the conception of an
inscrutable and unpredictable entity with a violent history and volatile
'mood swing'" (ibidem, 47). It is debatable whether as Pope Francis
states in Laudation Si: On Care for our Common Home (Encyclical
published by the Vatican, May 24, 2015) nature "is the sister that cries
out to us" and "a beautiful mother who opens her arms to embrace us". As
Clive Hamilton notes "Now when Mother Earth opens her arms it is not to
embrace but to crush us" (ibidem, 48). Because "Nature is no longer
passive and fragile, suffering in silence" (ibidem, 48). As Hamilton
argues, we no longer have to save nature but we should save ourselves
from nature and from ourselves. [The most **existential** threat is now
in the **fracture** between the unprecedented human power to **disrupt
the earth system**]{.underline} and "the uncontrollable powers of nature
it unleashed in the Anthropocene" (ibidem, 49). The interesting
conclusion is that we are not any longer free to treat the Earth as we
please. Our enormous power comes with an unsettling moral
responsibility: we no longer can choose between dominion and
stewardship. We have to accept that the anthropocene is anthropocentric
(ibidem, 50ff.) meaning that we have the power to change the course of
the earth system. This leads to the ethical conclusion that "we must
restrain ourselves and restrict what we do" (ibidem, 54). In the
conflict between humanity's unlimited desires and ambitions and the
finitude of the earth system [we must **control the dark
side**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} technological
**[development]{.underline}**. We must understand that the forces that
were expected to bring us more freedom, more equality and more
civilization also brought disruption of the earth system, lethal arms
systems, unprecedented ubiquitous surveillance and a tweeting culture
that effectively erodes whatever minimal deliberative social processes
we had developed. In this moral conflict, we must explore whether our
conventional ethical repertoire is adequate. Can we rely upon the will
of God or our love for nature? Can we trust enlightened self-interest?
Can the notion of collective public duty stand up against the solid
individualism of a modern capitalist society. Will the drive towards
self-preservation outlive the rampant media-induced indifference? Our
future is a confrontation between humans and an unpredictable earth
system. This has a certain outcome if we think we can afford
indifference and an uncertain outcome---at best--- if we treat an angry
mother Gaia with the care she deserves. [The question is whether today's
global community is capable of dealing with the existential risk of
extinction. [Can we **constitute** a **global resilient community** that
can **avoid this?**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Conclusion

As Abraham Lincoln, later president of the USA, on 16 June 1858 after he
had accepted the Illinois Republican Party's nomination as that state's
US senator, famously stated "[[A house]{.underline} **[divided against
itself]{.underline}**, **[cannot stand]{.underline}**".3
[In]{.underline}]{.mark} [order to deal effectively with a formidable
existential risk, [we must develop **communal** resilience]{.mark}.
[This involves]{.mark}]{.underline} the difficulty of
**[[accepting]{.underline}]{.mark}** genuine
**[[dissimilarities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It implies recognizing the
other as responsible agent. [It demands]{.underline} the **[critically
[probing]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the **[[arguments for different
positions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
**[accepting]{.underline}** [that togetherness is [only possible when
**groups** no longer **monopolize**]{.mark} the [truth]{.mark}. And
learning that fractures do not necessarily exclude "togetherness" as
long they do **not end in the dead alley of
polarization**]{.underline}.4

[If peace is]{.underline} conceptualized as "celebrating moments of
sheer human **[togetherness]{.underline}**" and if we aspire to peaceful
living together, [[we must **overcome**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} great **[obstacle of [polarized
fragmentation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It may not be the fragmentation in
so many different terrains on our planet that creates the essential
obstacle to the cosmopolitan togetherness that is basic to collective
joy. But the greater problem is that fragmentation is based upon a
mindset that is characterized by the belief in singular identities, in
the exclusion of alterity, in rampant individualism and in "thinking
alone". [This]{.underline} perspective [fits]{.underline} **[remarkably
well]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline} hierarchical social [orders
that characterize]{.underline} also **[modern]{.underline}** so-called
**[democratic societies]{.underline}**. For the conceptualization of
peace as moments of collective joy, it is also important to note that
such orders are antagonistic to collective festivities. "Ecstatic
rituals still build group cohesion, but when they build it among
subordinates -- peasants, slaves, women, colonized people- the elite
calls out its troops. In one way, the musically driven celebrations of
subordinates may be more threatening to elites than overt political
threats from below" (Ehrenreich 2007, 252).

#### Outweighs on magnitude. Polarization is a [generator function]{.underline} for [all]{.underline} existential risks. It'll [subvert]{.underline} any symptom-focused approach. 

Tristan **Harris &** Daniel **Schmachtenberger 21**, Harris is the

HARRIS: So, if you think about the topics that we\'ve covered, whether
you\'ve seen the social dilemma or you followed our interviews
previously on topics like **[attention span shortening]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[addiction]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[information overwhelm]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
[**distraction**, [the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[fall of trust in]{.mark}
[society]{.mark}**, more]{.underline} [**[polarization]{.mark}**,
[breakdown of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**truth**]{.mark}, our]{.underline}
[**[inability]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[solve
problems]{.underline}**]{.mark} like climate change, well, this
[[is]{.mark} really about [a]{.mark}n]{.underline} **[interconnected set
of problems]{.underline}** [and the]{.underline} kind of **[core
generator functions]{.underline}** that are [leading to]{.underline}
**[all of these things]{.underline}** to happen **[at
once]{.underline}**. So, I really encourage you to listen to this all
the way through, and I think that we\'re going to get into some very
deep and important knowledge that will hopefully be orienting for all of
us.

One of my favorite quotes is by Charles Kettering who said that, \"A
problem not fully understood is unsolvable, and a problem that is fully
understood is half solved.\" And what I hope we talk about with Daniel
is, what about the framework that we are using to address or try to meet
the various problems that we have has been inadequate, and what is the
problem solving framework that we\'re going to need to deal with the
existential crises that face us? So, Daniel, welcome to Your Undivided
Attention.

SCHMACHTENBERGER: Thank you, Tristan. I\'ve been looking forward to us
dialoguing about these things publicly for a while.

HARRIS: Well, you and me both, and for those who don\'t know, Daniel and
I have been friends for a very long time, and his work has been highly
influential to me and many people in my circles. So, Daniel, maybe we
should just start with, what is [the]{.underline} **[[meta
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and why are these problems seemingly not
getting solved, whether it\'s the SDGs, climate change or anything that
we really care about right now?

SCHMACHTENBERGER: I think a lot of people have the general sense that
[[there is an increasing **number** of]{.mark} possibly [catastrophic
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and that [as new **categories** of
**tech**]{.underline}, tech [that allows major]{.underline} **[[cyber
attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** on infrastructure, tech that allows
[weaponized **drone** attacks]{.underline} on infrastructure,
[**[biotech]{.mark}nologies**, **[a]{.mark}**]{.underline}rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence, and moving towards AGI, that
[[there are]{.mark} **new cata[strophic risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[with all of those categories]{.underline} of tech and that those tech
are [creating]{.underline} larger **[jumps in power]{.underline}**
[faster than **any types**]{.underline} of jumps of tech, [including
the]{.underline} development of the **[nuclear bomb]{.underline}** [in
the **past**]{.underline} [by]{.underline} many **[orders of
magnitude]{.underline}**.

So, there\'s a general sense that [whether we\'re talking about future
**[pandemic]{.mark}**]{.underline} related [issues or]{.underline}
whether we\'re talking about **[[climate]{.mark}
[change]{.mark}]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} climate change as a
forcing function for human **[[migration]{.underline}]{.mark}** tha[t
then causes **[resource wars]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[[political instability]{.underline}]{.mark}** [or the fragility of
the highly interconnected globalized world where a **problem** in **one
part** of the world can create **supply chain issues**]{.underline}
[that create problems **all around**]{.underline} the world, is that
[there\'s a sense that there\'s an increasing number of catastrophic
[risks]{.mark}, and that they [are]{.mark} [**increasing** **faster**
than we are **solving** them]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that when you
mention like with the UN, while progress has been made in certain
defined areas of the Sustainable Development Goals and progress was made
back when they were called the millennium development goals, we\'re very
far from anything like a comprehensive solution to any of them. We\'re
not even on track for something that is converging towards a
comprehensive solution.

And, if we look at the core initial mandate of the United Nations in
terms of thinking about how to, recognizing after World War II that
nation state government alone wouldn\'t prevent world war now that world
war was no longer viable because the amount of technology we had made it
a war that no one could win, we still haven\'t succeeded at nuclear
disarmament. We had some very limited nuclear disarmament success while
doing nuclear arms races at the same time. We went from two countries
with nukes to more countries with better nukes and that simultaneous to
that, every new type of tech that has emerged has created an arms race.
We haven\'t been able to prevent any of those. And the major tragedy of
the commons issues like climate change and over-fishing and dead zones
in the oceans and microplastics in the oceans and biodiversity loss, we
haven\'t been able to solve those either.

So, [rather than just think about this as like an **overwhelming**
number of totally **separate** issues, the question of, why are the
**[patterns]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of human behavior]{.mark} as we
**increase**]{.underline} our total **[tech]{.underline}**nological
**[capacity]{.underline}**, why are they **[increasing]{.underline}**
[catastrophic risk, and]{.underline} why are we **[not
solving]{.underline}** them well**[?]{.underline}** [[Are]{.mark}
there]{.underline} **[underlying patterns]{.underline}** [that we could
think of as]{.underline}, as you mentioned, [**[generator
functions]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline}]{.mark} catastrophic
[**[risk]{.underline}**,]{.mark} generator functions [of
our]{.underline} [**inability to solve them**, that if we]{.underline}
were to **[identify]{.underline}** those [and work at]{.underline}
[**that level**, we could solve]{.underline} **[all]{.underline}** of
the [expressions or symptoms, and if we]{.underline}
**[don\'t]{.underline}** [work at that level, we might not be able to
solve]{.underline} **[any]{.underline}** of them[?]{.underline}

Again, people who\'ve been thinking about this for a long time notice
these issues. They notice that you try to solve a \... The first one I
noticed when I was a kid was trying to solve an elephant poaching issue
in one particular region of Africa that didn\'t address the poverty of
the people that had no mechanism other than black market poaching,
didn\'t address people\'s mindset towards animals, didn\'t address a
macro economy that created poverty at scale. So, when the laws were put
in place and the fences were put in place to protect those elephants in
that area better, the poachers moved to poaching other animals,
particularly, in that situation, rhinos and gorillas that were both more
endangered than the elephants had been. So, you moved a problem from one
area to another and actually a more sensitive area.

We see this with, well, can we solve hunger by bringing commercial
agriculture to parts of the world that don\'t have it so that the people
don\'t either not have food or we have to ship them food? But if it\'s
commercial agriculture based on the kind of unsustainable,
environmentally unsustainable agricultural processes that lead to huge
amounts of nitrogen runoff going into river deltas that are causing dead
zones in the ocean, that can actually collapse the biosphere\'s capacity
to support life faster, then we\'re solving for a short term issue
that\'s important and driving even worse long-term issues. We see that
many of the reasons people who oppose climate change solutions in the
West, oppose them is because not because they have even really deeply
engaged in the underlying science and say the climate change isn\'t
real. That will oftentimes be what\'s said, but because of the solution
itself seems like it\'ll cause problems to other areas that they\'re
paying attention to that seem even more critical to them.

So, if the solution involves some kind of carbon tax or something that
would decrease GDP for the countries that agree to it, and some other
countries don\'t agree to it \... Let\'s say in this particular case,
the model that many people have is Western countries agree to it. Their
GDP growth decreases. China doesn\'t agree to it, and there\'s already a
very, very close neck and neck fight for who controls power in the 21st
century? Are we ceding the world to Chinese control that many people
think it has less civil liberties and is more authoritarian in its
nature? Or some people\'s answer to climate change is, well, we just
have to use less energy, but when you understand the energy correlates
directly to GDP and when GDP goes down, it affects poverty, people in
extreme poverty first and worst, and wars increase because people who
have desire to get more end up going zero-sum on each other, and only
when it\'s very positive sum does that not happen. You see all these
intricate theory of trade-offs, so we can\'t see that the problem is
climate change.

Everybody knows the problem of climate change is like a big thing, but
you\'ve got to look at climate change plus the macroeconomic issues that
would affect the poorest people and that would increase the chance of
war and the geopolitical dynamics between the West and China, whatever,
and the enforcement dynamics of international agreement. When you start
to recognize that the problem is that suite of things together, in a
way, it seems, well, that\'s too hard. We can\'t even begin to focus on
it.

I would say that that\'s actually easier. Because trying to solve
climate change on its own is actually impossible. Because if you\'re
trying to solve something that is going to externalize harm to some
other thing, maybe the other thing that you \... Maybe you solve that
thing, but you find out that you\'re in a worse position. So, I would
say that it\'s impossible to actually improve the world that way. Or
half the world that is paying attention to that other thing disagrees
with you so vehemently that all the energy goes into infighting, and
whatever some part of the world is trying to organize to do, the other
part of the world is doing everything they can to resist from happening.
Then, all the creative energy just burns up as heat, and we don\'t
actually accomplish anything.

So, I would say that [[the way **we\'re** trying to solve the problems
is]{.underline}]{.mark} actually [**mostly [impossible]{.mark}**.
It]{.underline} either solves it in a very narrow way while
externalizing harm and causing worse problems, or [makes it]{.underline}
**[impossible]{.underline}** [to solve **at all** [because it **drives
polarization**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And so, going to the level at which
the problems interconnect where that which everybody cares about is
being factored and where you\'re not externalizing other problems, what
seems more complex is actually possible, and possible is easier than
impossible. So, it\'s not just that there\'s a lot of issues, right?
There are a lot of issues and just that the issues are both more
consequential at greater scope and moving faster than previous issues
because of the nature of exponentiating technology. That\'s part of it.
[It\'s not just that the problems are all **interconnected**. It\'s also
that they do have **underlying drivers that have to be
addressed**]{.underline}. Otherwise, a symptomatic-only approach
doesn\'t work.

The first underlying driver that, when people look at it, they generally
see is they see things like structural perverse incentive built into
macroeconomics. That the elephant dead is worth more than the elephant
alive is and so as the rhino and so is the -- and. So, how do you have a
situation where that\'s the nature of incentive, where you\'re
incentivizing an activity and then trying to bind it or keep it from
happening? The same would be true with over-fishing. As long as live
fish are worth nothing and dead fish are worth more, and you have \...
There\'s something fundamentally perverse about the nature of the
economic incentive. The same is true that when war goes \... When we
have war and there\'s more military manufacturing, GDP goes up. When
there\'s more addiction and people are buying the supply of their
addiction, GDP goes up. When there are more sick people paying for
healthcare cost, GDP goes up.

So, it\'s obviously a perverse kind of metric. So, anytime someone can
fiscally advantage themselves or a corporation can, in a way that either
directly causes harm or indirectly externalizes harm, we have to
fundamentally solve that. If there\'s something like \$70 trillion a day
of activity happening that is a decentralized system of incentives that
is incenting people to do things that are directly or indirectly causing
harm, there\'s really nothing we can do with some billions of dollars of
nonprofit or state or whatever money that is going to solve that thing.
So, we have to say, well, what changes at the level of macroeconomics
need to happen where the incentive of individuals and the incentive of
corporations and the incentive of nations is more well aligned with the
well-being and the incentive of others, and so we\'re less fundamentally
rivalrous in the nature of our incentive?

So, we can see that underneath heaps of the problems, structures of
macroeconomic incentive are there. That\'s the kind of maybe the first
one that most people see. We can go deeper to seeing that even as an
expression, because, whether it\'s a economic incentive for a
corporation or whether it\'s a power incentive, a political power
incentive for a political party or for a country, they\'re both
instantiations of rivalrous-type dynamics that end up driving arms races
because if you win at a rivalrous dynamic, the other side reverse
engineers your tech, figures out how to make better versions, comes
back, which creates an exponentiation and warfare. And eventually,
exponential warfare becomes self-terminating on a finite planet.
Exponential externalities also become self-terminating. So, if we want
to say, what are the underlying generator functions of catastrophic
risk, first, maybe just to make clear, the catastrophic risk landscape.
Is this all right if we do a brief aside on that?

HARRIS: Yeah. Let\'s do it. Then, I think we \... Let\'s do that, and
then let\'s recap just what these structures are, so people are tracking
each of these components because you\'ve already mentioned a few
different things. I mean, the first thing is just, many listeners might
hear what you\'re sharing as an overwhelming set of problems. And, I
think just to recap, it\'s important people understand that it\'s
overwhelming if you\'re not using a problem solving framework that
allows you to see the interconnected nature of those problems because if
you solve them with the limited tools we have now, of let\'s just solve
the social media problem by pulling one lever and changing one business
model of one company or banning TikTok, but then you get 20 other
TikToks that come and sit in its place with the same perverse incentive
of addiction, the same rivalrous dynamic competing for human attention,
we\'re going to end up perpetuating those problems. So, just to sort of
maybe recap some of that for listeners, and I think maybe let you
continue with the other generator functions. Let\'s just make sure that
people really get those frameworks. I think it\'s really important.

SCHMACHTENBERGER: Yeah. I mean, in the case that you and Center for
Humane Technology have brought so much attention to [with regard to the
**attention harvesting**]{.underline} and directing
[economy]{.underline}, it\'s fair to say that [it probably was not
Facebook or Google\'s goal to create the type of effects that they had.
Those were **unintended**]{.underline} externalities. They were second
order effects. But they were trying to solve problems, right? [[Let\'s
solve]{.mark} the problem]{.underline}, if we\'re Google, [of
[organizing the world\'s **information**]{.mark}]{.underline} and making
better search. That seems like a pretty good thing to do. Let\'s [solve
the problem with [making it **freely available**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline} **[everybody]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Well, that seems
like a pretty good thing to do.

With the ad model, we can make it freely available to everyone, and
let\'s recognize that only if we get a lot of data will our machine
learning get better. So, [we need to]{.underline} actually [get
everybody on this thing, so we definitely have to make it free. Then, we
get this kind of recursive process.]{.underline}

Well then, the nature of the ad model doing time on site
**[optimization]{.underline}** and stuff I\'m not going to get into
because you\'ve addressed it so well, [ends up appealing to people\'s
**existing biases**]{.underline} [rather than]{.underline}
**[correcting]{.underline}** their **[bias]{.underline}**, [appealing to
their tribal **ingroup identities**]{.underline} [rather than correcting
them and appealing to **limbic hijacks**]{.underline} [rather than
helping people **transcend** them]{.underline}. And [as a result, you
end up actually **breaking**]{.underline} the **[social
solidarity]{.underline}** [and **epistemic capacity necessary for
democracy**]{.underline}. So, it\'s like, \"Oh, [let\'s solve the search
problem. That]{.underline} **[seems]{.underline}** like a
**[nice]{.underline}** thing. [The **side effect**]{.underline} [is
we\'re going to]{.underline} **[destroy]{.underline}** democracy and
**[open societies in the process]{.underline}**, and all those other
things.\" Those are examples of solving a problem in a way that is
externalizing harm, causing other problems that are oftentimes worse.
And so \... let\'s just focus on the opportunity and --

HARRIS: Typically, this will get accounted for as, oh, this is just an
unintended consequence, but there\'s some other generator functions, I
think, we should outline. I mean, if YouTube and Google didn\'t
personalize search results and what video to show you next, then the
other guy did, and TikTok starts personalizing, [they\'re caught in a
**race to the bottom**]{.underline} [of whoever personalizes more for
the best limbic hijack]{.underline} and so just to sort of connect some
of those themes together for listeners.

#### Article V's cyber response limited now

**FifthDomain Staff 17**, "NATO might trigger Article 5 for certain
cyberattacks," 6/1/17,
https://www.fifthdomain.com/home/2017/06/01/nato-might-trigger-article-5-for-certain-cyberattacks-cycon-tallinn/

TALLINN, Estonia --- NATO will not rule out invoking Article 5 of its
charter should one or more member nations find themselves under a
serious cyberattack that threatens critical military and civilian
infrastructure.

[[NATO officials told]{.mark} [delegates]{.mark} at the International
Conference on Cyber Conflict, or CyCon, in Estonia that [the]{.mark}
Western [alliance]{.mark} [would deliver a]{.mark} robust [response in

[attack]{.mark} on a member state [in cyberspace. **Article 5** provides
for a **united response**]{.mark}]{.underline} [by NATO
states]{.underline} should a member nation come under attack.

E[stonia came under a series of coordinated denial-of-service attacks in
2007 that caused serious disruption to state IT infrastructure,
including military networks]{.underline}. The cyberattack also targeted
online platforms run by the country's leading banks, denying customers
access to their accounts and basic services.

\"[Although [many]{.mark} of the [cyberattacks]{.mark} that we see [fall
**below a level** ]{.mark}**in their seriousness**]{.underline} [[that

that might **[[lead to]{.mark} the [triggering]{.mark} of [Article
5]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[special
circumstances]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" said Catherine Lotrionte,
director of CyberProject at Georgetown University.

\"[Most attacks in cyberspace **use no force**. [We would need]{.mark}
to have [a **legal threshold**]{.mark}]{.underline} [for such threat
situations]{.underline}, [but the triggering of Article 5 is a real
**possibility**]{.underline}. There are other issues, like time factors.
A grave threat would need to be current, and not an event that happened
years ago,\" she added.

[This article was written with the intention of making 'hybrid
threats']{.underline} as a 21st -century security threat [known to the
wider audience **despite** [NATO's decision]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[not]{.underline}** [to adopt a **comprehensive
approach**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This **failure**]{.underline} [does
not **reduce the dangers**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of this category of
global risks]{.underline}. [Ongoing debate]{.underline} and academic
engagement with the topic and rationale of 'hybrid threats', such as the
Swedish experiment in 2012, [will hopefully lead to **further
awareness**]{.underline} [and eventually]{.underline}
**[preparedness]{.underline}**. This submission concludes with a
sobering prediction: it is the opinion of the authors that the [[present
legal concepts on]{.mark} the [use of]{.mark} military [force]{.mark},
the [jus ad bellum]{.mark}, [have become]{.mark}]{.underline} relatively
anachronistic and even partially **[[outdated]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[something that will not suffice when dealing with the security threats
and challenges of the 21st century.]{.underline} The authors predict
that [the **[emergence of hybrid threats]{.mark}** and their recognition
as potential threats to peace and security as such, the
[**proliferation** of **low-threshold regional
conflicts**]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as the 2011 Libyan conflict,
Syria and now Iraq), [[as well as]{.mark} continuing **[asymmetric
warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline} [scenarios]{.underline} (such as Syria,
Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan) [[will have a **significant
influence**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[on]{.mark} the prevailing culture and
prism of [traditional military]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[activity]{.mark},]{.underline} which is still influenced by concepts
from the previous century. [[With such a change of **military
doctrines**, a change]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[legal
paradigms]{.underline}** [will be]{.underline}
**[inevitable]{.underline}**]{.mark}: [[new]{.mark} adaptive
[means]{.mark} and methods [of 'flexible responsiveness']{.mark} through
escalating levels of confrontation and deterrence
[will]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[question]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the
**[existing legal concept]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} the
**[prohibition of the use of force]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with]{.mark}
its [**limited exceptions,** as]{.mark} [envisaged under]{.mark}
Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter and [**Article 5** of]{.mark} the
[NATO Treaty]{.mark}]{.underline}.53 Future direct intervention in
failed state scenarios will require flexibility in terms of choice of
military assets and objectives. Future responses to multi-modal threats
will always include the kinetic force option, directed against -- most
likely -- NSAs. They will also affect our present concepts of the
illegality of the use of force in international relations, as enshrined
in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter with limited exceptions available
under Article 51 of the UN Charter, namely individual and collective
self-defence (cf. Article 5 of the NATO Treaty) as well as UN
authorisation. Already today, the continuing use of UAVs (unmanned
aerial vehicles, or drones) for 'targeted killing' operations
effectively emphasises the legal challenges ahead: the ongoing 'kill'
operations in the so-called 'tribal' areas of Waziristan/Pakistan are
kinetic military operations, which demonstrate how quickly the critical
threshold of an armed conflict can be reached and even surpassed. These
operations clearly fall within the scope of the definition of 'armed
conflict' by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia in the appeal decision in The Prosecutor v Dusko Tadic54 and
therefore giving rise to the applicability of the norms of the so-called
'Law of Armed Conflict', the body of international humanitarian law
governing conduct in war. The 'lawfulness' of such operations does,
however, require the existence of either a mandate in terms of Article
51 of the UN Charter (in the form of a United Nations Security Council
\[UNSC\] Resolution authorising the use of force in an enforcement and
peace enforcement operation context) or the existence of an illegal
armed attack in order to exercise a right to national or state
self-defence in terms of Article 51 of the UN Charter. Whether such
military operations are within the scope of these categories remains
open to discussion.

[NATO has been primarily concerned with building up cybersecurity **in
member states**]{.underline}. The next step, led by the United States,
is to go on the offensive and accurately identify the sources of these
cyber aggressions. On several occasions, [Russia has been able
to]{.underline} **[hide]{.underline}** [behind the idea that the
cyber-attackers are **not state-affiliated**]{.underline} and fiend
responsibility of aggressions from within the Federation:

> Three successive U.S. administrations have failed to develop any form
> of doctrine to adequately address increasingly problematic
> cyberattacks from unattributable sources that plague U.S. businesses
> and can even endanger lives. Instead, the private sector has been left
> to deal with ever more destructive and dangerous ransomware attacks
> unassisted, and Russia continues to do nothing about cyberattacks
> originating from Russian territory.29

[This is an]{.underline} **[epidemic]{.underline}** [that can be cured
by]{.underline} **[shifting]{.underline}** from a conservative policy
regarding the cyberworld and [towards a]{.underline} **[more proactive
position]{.underline}**. If the United States were able to identify
actors with precision, further measures could be taken to prevent
attacks on the U.S. infrastructure and on the private sector. In
addition, [being able to]{.underline} **[identify]{.underline}** these
**[actors]{.underline}** [would allow the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and its allies
[to]{.underline} **[expose]{.underline}** the **[perpetrators

[with]{.underline} [**solid evidence**, damaging the
perpetrator]{.underline} state's **[reputation]{.underline}** [with the

[**intelligence sharing**, **public statements of support**]{.underline}
[for actions taken following an attack, and participation in
the]{.underline} **[charges]{.underline}** [taken against the

ability of the United States and its allies to accurately identify
perpetrators with a proactive joint campaign.

2\. Applying Deterrence in the Context of Russian Behavior

This section builds on the previous assessments and [explores the
application of deterrence theory at the **sub-conventional
level**]{.underline} [in the]{.underline} specific [context of
Russia]{.underline} as a state actor [and its]{.underline} use of a
[gray zone strategy]{.underline}. It considers the [value of
**tailoring** a deterrent strategy against Russian gray zone conflict by
**supplementing** conventional deterrence with]{.underline}
"**[cumulative deterrence]{.underline}**." Recall that any deterrence
strategy relies on sufficient capabilities, solid resolve, and strong
communication of a threat, which in turn create credibility.225
[Cumulative deterrence]{.underline}, elaborated in the following
paragraphs, [introduces the idea that **credibility** can
be]{.underline} **[sustained]{.underline}** [across **multiple
encounters** even if deterrence fails in **certain
instances**]{.underline}, [vis-à-vis **classic**
**zero-tolerance**]{.underline} [nuclear deterrence]{.underline}.

Regarding tailoring deterrence, Bunn writes, "If deterrence is about
influencing the perceptions---and ultimately, the decisions and
actions---of another party, it is logical that the [requirements for
deterrence will differ with each]{.underline} party that we might try to
deter and may well differ in each [circumstance or
scenario]{.underline}."226 [**Adapting deterrence** to the
**subconventional level**]{.underline} [requires an understanding of the
unique relationship between the states to identify the relative
stability and instability that can inform deterrence
strategy.]{.underline}

The [stability--instability paradox applies to the **nuclear** and
**conventional**]{.underline} [level]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
indeed, [Russia's effort to]{.underline} **[avoid]{.underline}**
[conventional-level warfare with the United States **strengthens
stability** between the states at the]{.underline} **[conventional
level]{.underline}** similar to the strategic nuclear level. While
U.S.--Russian nuclear stability is based on parity, conventional
stability in this relationship is more complex. As shown in Chapter II,
Russia has a strong aversion to conflict with the United States and NATO
at the conventional level. Russia would be outmatched in military
superiority after two to three weeks of conflict and beyond its near
abroad and, thus, prefers to operate at the sub-conventional level below
the threshold of armed conflict.227 In effect, [Russia's strategy of
**avoiding** any actions that might trigger **conventional
conflict**]{.underline} [aims to bolster a sort of "**firewall**"
between]{.underline} [conventional warfare and gray zone
conflict]{.underline}. [NATO, up to now, has **effectively obliged**
this Russian strategy by **not brandishing threats of conventional
escalation**]{.underline} [in response to Russian gray zone aggression,
**let alone undertaking conventional responses.** As much as
[Russia]{.mark} seeks **to avoid escalation** to conventional warfare it
could not win, it [is]{.mark} also [learning]{.mark} [**how averse NATO
is** to **threaten**]{.mark} **such [escalation]{.mark}**. This aversion
is **ironic**]{.underline} insofar as Cold War--era extended deterrence
relied on NATO's threat of escalatory nuclear responses to conventional
attacks.

[These respective]{.underline} [Russian and [NATO posture]{.mark}s
**enhance conventional stability**]{.underline}, [but at the **cost** of
**[fuel]{.mark}ing [instability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[at the **gray
zone**]{.mark} **level**]{.underline}, [reflecting a form of the
stability-- instability paradox familiar in nuclear
strategies]{.underline}. This tailored application of the stability--
instability paradox to the specific Russian context yields a tiered
relationship of stability between the United States and Russia at each
level of warfare, as depicted in Figure 1, and helps explain why the
United States and Russia are the most unstable at the subconventional
level, on which this research focuses.

**[Cumulative deterrence]{.underline}** [may be an option to **address
the issues** created when adapting conventional deterrence to the
sub-conventional level]{.underline} including the credibility and
communication of the threat. Cumulative deterrence has not been a
standard element of U.S. deterrence strategy in the past, and there is
limited academic literature and strategic thought about its use in areas
outside of cyber and terrorism. However, this [new security environment
characterized by great power competition at levels **below open
conflict**]{.underline} [requires a **new way**]{.underline} [of looking
at the deterrence landscape at the]{.underline} **[sub-conventional
level]{.underline}**. [Subject matter experts for this research
confirm]{.underline} that [[a **zero-tolerance**]{.mark}
[deterrence]{.mark} mindset **[will not work]{.mark}** at the
sub-conventional level and that [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [might [have to **choose**]{.mark} **[what
portions of]{.mark} the [gray zone it wants to deter]{.mark} because it
may be [difficult to deter everything]{.mark}.**]{.underline}229

There is a precedent for applying a cumulative model and mindset of
deterrence to limit and shape the sub-conventional level of conflict,
and this suggests it may also be applied to the current U.S. need to
deter Russia's gray zone conflict. According to Thomas Rid, [[cumulative
deterrence]{.mark} "consists of a series of acts of force to
create]{.underline}---[and [maintain]{.mark}]{.underline}--- [general
**[norms of behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for many political actors
[over]{.mark} an **[extended period.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Using
force,]{.underline} consequently, [does **not** represent a principal
**failure of deterrence**]{.underline} [but its **maintenance** through
**swift**]{.underline}, **[certain]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline}
**[measured]{.underline}** [responses]{.underline}."230 Cumulative
deterrence has been a key part of Israel's strategy for decades and was
developed in the conventional and subconventional level focusing on
limiting and shaping ongoing conflicts against both state and non-state
actors at the conventional and sub-conventional level.231 In addition,
cumulative deterrence has recently been considered for use in deterring
terrorism and cyberattacks, as it is designed for long-term sustained
conflict, such as competition in the gray zone.232

Doron Almong describes cumulative deterrence as functioning on two
levels: the macro, which creates an image of overwhelming military
superiority, and the micro, which relies on responses to adversarial
actions.233 Almong also explains that cumulative deterrence has three
key features.

First, its [effectiveness is measured in terms of the number of
victories **accumulated** over the **duration** of the
conflict,]{.underline} which might be envisioned as "assets in a victory
bank." Second, [over time, these victories produce]{.underline}
**[increasingly moderate behavior]{.underline}** [on the part of the
adversary and a shift in its **strategic**]{.underline},
**[operational]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[tactical
goals]{.underline}** [until there is a **near-absence** of **direct
conflict.**]{.underline} Third, [this moderation may **eventually**
result in **political negotiations** and perhaps even a **peace
agreement**.]{.underline}234 Almong is describing cumulative deterrence
as applied to the conventional level of warfare; however, in the context
of Russia, the construct can be transposed to the subconventional level.
[At the sub-conventional level, [U.S. responses over time]{.mark} to
Russian gray zone aggression [could **moderate Russian
behavior**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [causing a **shift** in Russia's
**decision calculus** and **strategic goals,** thereby
**[diminishing]{.mark} the [conflict]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The advantage of layering a strong conventional deterrence strategy with
cumulative deterrence is that it allows the restoration of deterrence
over time if conventional threats fail to deter at the sub-conventional
level. **[Over time]{.underline}**, [cumulative deterrence responses to
gray zone actions **[bolster]{.mark} the
[cred]{.mark}ibility**]{.underline} [[of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates and **alter Russia's decision calculus**]{.underline}
[at the sub-conventional level, therefore **[strengthening]{.mark}
[deterrence overall]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[**Successful deterrence**
at the **sub-conventional level** requires]{.mark} a
**[reorientation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in how the U.S. **views
deterrence**]{.underline}, [moving [from a **zero-tolerance
strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} the [**long-term**
attrition]{.mark} of gray zone conflict]{.underline}. [This renewed
mindset allows for **tailored** punitive]{.underline} [strategies that
**over time** **limit the bounds**]{.underline} [of the gray zone
through the **reiteration** of **unacceptable behavior**]{.underline}
through punishment. Regardless of the level at which a state wishes to
conduct warfare, all deterrence strategies rely on three aspects that
must work in concert: sufficient capabilities, solid credibility, and
strong communication of a threat.235 As Rid explains,
[[confrontations]{.mark} should be "seen as necessary evils that should
be kept on **as low a level as possible**, **but that [could not be
pushed]{.mark} down [to zero]{.mark}**]{.underline}."236 This argument
assumes escalation control, which is to say that the United States can
control escalation at the sub-conventional level on its own terms.

Many authors challenge the notion of escalation control, claiming that
it is risky and nearly impossible. Scholars claim that avoiding
escalation requires deterring the action and that a policy to deter one
action could in fact risk escalation to another. Additionally, scholars
claim, "Escalation control or management is an inherently imperfect
business. It can be done well or poorly, but it is extremely rare for
any set of policies to eliminate the risk of significant escalation
altogether."237 These same scholars agree that the risk of inadvertent
escalation can be reduced, but they are concerned that policy makers are
incorrectly assuming it can be eliminated altogether.238 The concerns
over escalation control are valid; however, it is possible to control
escalation and use the threat of escalation to bolster deterrence.
Mazarr explains that the gray zone puts the defender in the position to
escalate, which is part of the challenge of deterrence.239 Both
escalation control and deterrence fundamentally rely on communication
and a thorough understanding of the adversary. Proper communication of
the capability and the resolve to use the capability to deny or punish
an action are just as crucial to escalation control as they are to
deterrence. The same scholars who express concerns over escalation
control also admit there is a way to control the risk: "Escalation
depends heavily on an astute understanding of how the adversary will
perceive and interpret events that have not yet occurred---not only in a
general sense, but also under the specific and often
difficult-to-predict conditions that will shape the opponent's
perceptions and responses when a particular event occurs."240 The United
States can both mitigate escalation and contribute to deterrence by
adding an element of ambiguity to its deterrence threats that leave
something to chance but also allow a response that limits or controls
the escalatory response of the adversary.

When the United States responds with an instrument of state power in any
DIME category, such as the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats in response
to the Russian nerve agent attack on a British citizen in 2018, it can
strengthen cumulative deterrence credibility. Some of the literature on
cumulative deterrence suggests that deterrence works by banking "wins"
by responding to events with military power. However, when adapted to
the gray zone, it seems critical that all elements of state power must
be utilized, not just the military[. The military is
**sometimes**]{.underline}---**[not always]{.underline}**---[an
appropriate response to an action in the gray zone]{.underline}, [so
[threatening military retaliation for]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**every
tactic** in the gray zone is **not credible**]{.underline}]{.mark};
however, a state must still have the ability to impose costs on an
adversary for an action to make cumulative deterrence successful.

The abovementioned [incidents have led]{.underline}
[cyber]{.underline}-conflict [scholars to point to]{.underline} several
**[technical]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[practical
difficulties]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} the **[operational
integration]{.underline}** [of cyber effects]{.underline}.29
[In]{.underline} the **[interviews]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[background conversations]{.underline}** that contributed to this
study, **[three]{.underline}** of these **[difficulties]{.underline}**
[were]{.underline} **[continuously reiterated]{.underline}** when
discussing successful integration of cyber effects into NATO operational
planning: [the]{.underline} **[temporal]{.underline}**
[dimension]{.underline} of developing exploits; [the]{.underline}
**[assessment]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} battle [**damage**; and
the problem of]{.underline} **[confliction]{.underline}**.

Developing exploits---a matter of time

[One of the characteristics of cyber attacks that receives most
attention is the fact that they]{.underline} **[hit
suddenly]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[without
warning]{.underline}**.30 [While this is]{.underline}
**[often]{.underline}** [the case, the central question for]{.underline}
**[operational]{.underline}** [integration is not the speed at which
they]{.underline} **[hit]{.underline}** their target, [but the speed
with which]{.underline} the **[tools]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[techniques]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}
**[exploit]{.underline}** IT **[vulnerabilities]{.underline}** in order
to deliver cyber effects [can be **developed**]{.underline}. Like
conventional weapons, the [cyber tools]{.underline}---the exploits or
cyber weapons---[take]{.underline} **[time]{.underline}** to develop.
[However, an exploit is often **harder to reuse**]{.underline} than a
conventional weapon, [as it is more dependent on a]{.underline}
**[meticulous analysis]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**target
preparation**---in this case, specifically, the target's IT
infrastructure. Without knowing the adversary's IT systems and its
vulnerabilities **better than the adversary**]{.underline} itself,
[meaningful cyber weapons are]{.underline} **[impossible]{.underline}**
to develop.

The fact that knowledge about the target is linked not only to the
deployment of a weapon but also to its development influences the extent
to which it can be used and reused. **[Stuxnet]{.underline}**, for
example, [required]{.underline} **[years]{.underline}** [of
development]{.underline}, testing and perfecting before it could deliver
the intended effect on the Iranian centrifuges. Despite the techniques
used in the Stuxnet malware having been found in other malware,31
[Stuxnet]{.underline} **[lost]{.underline}** [its ability to destroy the
centrifuges when it was]{.underline} **[discovered]{.underline}** [and
the]{.underline} IT [vulnerabilities that enabled it were
**patched**]{.underline}. Importantly, part of the complexity of Stuxnet
relates to the US--Israeli intention to keep the effect secret. In a hot
conflict, secrecy in terms of the effect is often less important, and
thus the development and deployment of cyber effects do not necessarily
have to be as complex and time-consuming.

This observation does not necessarily change the fact that [the
development of exploits often has to]{.underline} **[precede the
military confrontation]{.underline}** [in which they are]{.underline}
intended to be **[used]{.underline}**. [NATO states that want to deliver
cyber effects in NATO operations must]{.underline} try to [gain access
to]{.underline} **[Russia's]{.underline}** or other potential
adversaries' critical military **[networks]{.underline}** to identify
and exploit IT vulnerabilities. As several informants emphasized, [if
states]{.underline} **[wait]{.underline}** [for a conflict
to]{.underline} **[escalate]{.underline}** before they begin the
development of exploits, [it is]{.underline} most likely to be already
**[too late]{.underline}**.32

[The]{.underline} **[alternative]{.underline}** to penetrating adversary
networks in peacetime [is for states to rely on]{.underline} the
[exploitation of vulnerabilities in as many]{.underline}
**[c]{.underline}**ommercial
**[o]{.underline}**ff-**[t]{.underline}**he-**[s]{.underline}**helf
[products as possible. This can be done]{.underline}, for example, [by
purchasing exploits from]{.underline} **[private
companies]{.underline}** offering this service, [in the hope that it
will then be possible to quickly create an overview of the enemy's IT
infrastructure and adapt the exploits to this environment]{.underline}
when a conflict escalates. [The latter approach is more likely to
succeed against adversaries with low network security, which does **not
apply in**]{.underline} the case of **[Russia]{.underline}**, or in
contexts where less sophisticated and less closely targeted cyber
effects are required.

[Whether member states develop sophisticated exploits for future
targeted effects or stockpile well-known exploits to cause more minor
effects, they]{.underline} **[cannot]{.underline}**---as several
informants indicated---**[be certain that they will be able to deliver
the cyber effect at the specific time it is requested]{.underline}** by
CYOC. [This is because]{.underline} the [IT vulnerabilities upon which
exploits depend might **not exist for ever**. Cyberspace is]{.underline}
a **[dynamic]{.underline}** environment: [vulnerabilities are patched,
systems are updated or replaced and bad IT security practices are
identified and improved. This means that exploits are]{.underline}
**[temporary]{.underline}** in nature [and]{.underline} **[cannot be
stored]{.underline}** for later use.33 [States must]{.underline}
**[constantly ensure]{.underline}** that the [exploits]{.underline}
[**still work**, which requires]{.underline} minor
**[adjustments]{.underline}** when updates take place. As a consequence,
[the larger the military 'cyber arsenal', the **more**]{.underline}
technically **[skilled human resources]{.underline}** [are needed for
its **maintenance**. In the current labour market, where recruitment and
retention of a cyber workforce is difficult, **extensive
investment**]{.underline} [is required]{.underline} for states to be
able to stand ready with cyber effects available when requested.

In short, [if a state is to offer a cyber effect in a NATO operation,
then the state is likely to have to be able, first, to]{.underline}
**[predict what]{.underline}** Russian IT **[systems]{.underline}** [it
is going to target]{.underline} months or [**years in advance**,
and]{.underline} second, [to]{.underline} **[marshal]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} necessary **[resources]{.underline}** to develop and
maintain a large array of exploits that can be used against these
systems. [Even if this is]{.underline} [**successfully done**, the state
still faces difficulty in ensuring that an effect is **delivered as
promised**]{.underline}.

**[Deterring what?]{.underline}**

[Much of the scholarly debate on NATO is preoccupied with the current
**strategic adaptation of the alliance**]{.underline} and the renewed
focus [on]{.underline} **[deterring Russia]{.underline}**.48 [Only a
**few contributors**]{.underline} to this debate [have
addressed]{.underline} the addition of **[offensive cyber]{.underline}**
capabilities [in]{.underline} **[NATO force structure]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[response doctrine]{.underline}** as an element in
work to strengthen the alliance's deterrence posture.49 [Neither in
these contributions nor among the former and current NATO employees who
have publicly articulated this ambition is it clear]{.underline} **[what
kind of activity]{.underline}** [the integration of
**cyber**]{.underline} effects [in]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}**
[seeks to]{.underline} **[deter]{.underline}**.50 [Is it supposed
to]{.underline} **[add]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} the
**[classical]{.underline}** [deterrence (through the threat
of]{.underline} [**punishment**) of conventional Russian threats to the
territorial integrity of eastern Europe? Or to the deterrence of
**hybrid**]{.underline} [activities---specifically
**cyber**]{.underline} activities---against allied countries below the
threshold of armed conflict? This section addresses each of these
possibilities in turn.

From Cold War deterrence and back

[NATO's]{.underline} **[founding]{.underline}** [purpose was to maintain
a sufficient military strength to deter aggression and attempts at
coercion]{.underline}, to prepare for the eventuality of deterrence
failing, [and to ensure stability among European powers]{.underline}.51
During the Cold War, the debates over NATO deterrence posture largely
centred on the role of nuclear weapons, and specifically whether the
United States would retaliate with these weapons in the event of a
Soviet conventional attack against allied states.52 In short, NATO
deterrence was about credibly extending the US nuclear (as well as
conventional force) deterrence to allies to discourage a Soviet military
offensive into eastern Europe.

While NATO and its member states adapted to the new security environment
after the end of the Cold War by scaling down the military investments
and presence in eastern Europe and by focusing more on crisis
management,53 much of the Cold War deterrence language returned when the
Russian--Ukrainian conflict broke out in 2014.54 What needs to be
deterred today, much of the literature agrees, is not only a full-scale
military invasion but to a larger extent the use and support of
pro-Russian militant separatists who are willing to apply insurgency
tactics in NATO's post-Soviet member states.55 As a result, the allies'
military investments have been increasing again,56 a number of
initiatives such as the Enhanced Forward Presence in the Baltic States
and Poland have been introduced,57 and the discussions---and
disagreements---on the nuclear deterrence (of non-nuclear threats) have
re-emerged.58 Such responses are often presented as a renewed attempt by
NATO to reassert its deterrence and assurance posture by signalling
strength, preparedness and willingness to punish 'bad' behaviour.59

[At first sight, the introduction of CYOC **seems** to **add** to these
deterrence efforts. NATO added an offensive cyber option to reinforce
its ability to impose costs]{.underline} sufficient to dissuade
adversaries from acting aggressively. [On]{.underline} **[closer
examination]{.underline}**, [however, it is **not self-evident that
requesting member states' delivery of offensive cyber effects in NATO
operations constitutes a necessary or even a substantial addition to
credibly signalling the ability and willingness to punish an
adversary**. NATO's **conventional**]{.underline} [capabilities
are]{.underline} **[clearly already far superior]{.underline}** to
Russia's---**[with or without]{.underline}** fully integrated [**cyber
effects**. Thus, a]{.underline} [**deterrence failure**, resulting for
example in]{.underline} a scenario in one of [the]{.underline} **[Baltic
states]{.underline}** similar to that which occurred in eastern Ukraine,
[will]{.underline} **[not be the result of NATO's lack of]{.underline}**
available **[cyber tools]{.underline}** in its military toolbox;
[rather, if the Russian leadership were to consider it in its interest
to pursue such a scenario, it would mean that Russia's decision-makers
did **not believe in the credibility of NATO's article 5**]{.underline}
[or in]{.underline} **[NATO's ability to mobilize]{.underline}** its
[**forces**. The capacity to]{.underline} **[integrate cyber
effects]{.underline}** [would do]{.underline} **[nothing to change
that]{.underline}**.

Furthermore, [if the establishment of CYOC is an attempt to
signal]{.underline} **[defensive strength]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[unity]{.underline}** in cyberspace, [it
remains]{.underline} [**difficult to imagine that such signalling would
dissuade adversaries from trying to penetrate NATO and allied systems**.
CYOC does]{.underline} **[not change]{.underline}** [the fact that NATO
is **not tasked to govern and secure national IT**]{.underline} systems.
[In an]{.underline} **[operational]{.underline}** [setting, states might
connect to each other through so-called]{.underline} **[federated
mission networking]{.underline}**; 60 [but there is]{.underline} **[no
tradition of ceding control]{.underline}** of the deployed national
networks **[to NATO]{.underline}** during military operations. [Hence,
CYOC can only realistically seek to become a hub for]{.underline}
cyber-threat **[info]{.underline}**rmation**[-sharing]{.underline}**
[and to support]{.underline} states' **[coordination]{.underline}** and
synchronization of various national responses to these threats. [In
other words, CYOC is **unlikely to become an active defender in
cyberspace**]{.underline} [that causes doubt in the adversary's
evaluation of its own cyber capabilities. This also means that even if
CYOC's]{.underline} coordination and information-sharing [efforts manage
to contribute to]{.underline} the **[denial]{.underline}** of intrusions
into allied systems, [an adversary's military is **unlikely to be
deterred**]{.underline} from trying to hack these systems. In fact,
**[actively articulating]{.underline}** [that CYOC is **supposed to
deter**]{.underline} (**[through denial]{.underline}**) [a perceived
adversary such as]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline} **[hacking NATO]{.underline}** and allied operational
systems [creates an]{.underline} **[incentive to do just that and
thereby show that the alliance is incapable of doing what it
says]{.underline}** it seeks to do.

#### Strategic ambiguity [spurs escalation]{.underline} in [cyberspace specifically]{.underline} because it's an [offense-dominant]{.underline} domain\-\--[norms]{.underline} solve

**[Escalation]{.underline}** **[follows]{.underline}** [from the
**nature of cyber attacks**]{.underline} [and the **dynamics of
cyberspace**]{.underline} (Floridi and Taddeo 2014a, b; Taddeo 2014a,
2016, 2017). Non[-kinetic [cyber
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}---[aggressive uses of information and
communications]{.underline} [technologies that do not cause destruction
or casualties]{.underline}, e.g. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
attacks---**[[cost little]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in terms of
**resources**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[risks]{.underline}** [to
the attackers, [while having **high**]{.mark} **chances**]{.underline}
[to be **[success]{.mark}ful**]{.underline}, e.g. impairing the services
of targeted server or website. At the same time, cyber defence is porous
by its own nature (Morgan 2012): every system has bugs in the program
(vulnerabilities), identifying and exploiting them is just a matter of
time, means, and determination. This makes even the most sophisticated
cyber defence mechanisms ephemeral and, thus, limits their potential to
deter new attacks.

[Even when successful, cyber defence does not lead to **strategic
advantages**]{.underline}, [insofar as **dismounting a cyber
attack**]{.underline}, [may bring **tactical success**]{.underline},
[but very rarely leads to the ultimate]{.underline} **[defeating of an
adversary]{.underline}** (Taddeo 2017). [This [creates an environment of
**persistent offence**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Harknett and Goldman 2016),
[[where attacking is **tactically**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} **[strategically]{.underline}** [[more
advantageous]{.underline} [than]{.underline}
**[defending]{.underline}**]{.mark}. As Haknett and Goldman argue, [in
an offence-persistent]{.underline} [environment, [defence can
achieve]{.mark} tactical and operational [success]{.mark} in the short
term if it can adjust constantly to the means of attack, [but]{.mark} it
**[cannot win]{.mark} strategically**]{.underline}. **[Offence will
persist]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [the **interactions** with the
enemy]{.underline} [will remain **constant**]{.underline}. This is why
inter-state cyber defence have shifted from reactive (defending) towards
an active (countering) defence strategies.

[In this scenario, state actors make policy decisions to protect their
abilities to launch cyber attacks.]{.underline} **[Strategic
ambiguity]{.underline}** [is one of these decisions]{.underline}.
[According to this policy, states decide neither to **define**
nor]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[inform]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} [international community about **their red
lines**]{.underline}---thresholds that once crossed would trigger state
response--- [for non-kinetic cyber attacks]{.underline} (Mariarosaria
Taddeo 2011). [This approach leaves]{.underline} **[de facto
unregulated]{.underline}** [cyber attacks]{.underline} [that
remain]{.underline} **[below the threshold]{.underline}** [of an armed
attack]{.underline}. [[Strategic ambiguity]{.mark} has]{.underline}
often [been presented as a way to **confuse the opponents**]{.underline}
[about the consequences of their cyber attacks]{.underline}. As the US
National Intelligence Officer for Cyber Issues officer put it:

Currently most countries, including ours, don't want to be incredibly
specific about the red lines for two reasons: [You don't want to invite
people to do anything they want **below that red line** thinking they'll
be able to do it **with impunity**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
secondly, [you don't want to back yourself into a **strategic
corner**]{.underline} [where you have to respond if they do something
above that red line or else lose credibility]{.underline} in a
geopolitical sense.6

[By fostering ambiguity, state actor]{.underline}s also [leave open for
themselves a **wider room** for **manoeuvring**]{.underline}. [Strategic
ambiguity allows state actors to **deploy cyber attacks** for military,
espionage, sabotage, and surveillance purposes]{.underline} **[without
being constrained]{.underline}** [by their own policies or international
red lines. This makes ambiguity]{.underline} a **[dangerous
choice]{.underline}**, [one that is **strategically risky**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[politically misleading.]{.underline}**

[The [risks]{.mark} [come with]{.mark} the [**cascade effect**
following]{.mark} the [**absence** of **clear
thresholds**]{.mark}]{.underline} [for cyber attacks]{.underline}. [The
lack of thresholds **[facilitates]{.mark} a [prolif]{.mark}eration [of
offensive strategies]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [[This]{.mark}, in turn,
[favours a]{.mark}n **international [cyber arms
race]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} the **[weaponization]{.mark}
of cyberspace,**]{.underline} [[which]{.mark} ultimately [spurs]{.mark}
the **[escalation]{.mark} of cyber attacks.** This is why strategic
ambiguity is a **policy hazard** that]{.underline}
**[fuels]{.underline}**, [rather than **arrests**]{.underline},
**[escalation]{.underline}** [of **interstate cyber
attacks**]{.underline}. [[Cyber attacks would be **deterred more
effectively**]{.underline} [by a **regime of international
norms**]{.underline} (]{.mark}defining proportionality criteria for
responses, setting red lines, and procedure for accountability, and for
capability building) [[that make]{.mark}s **[attacks politically
costly]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to the point of being
**disadvantageous**]{.underline}]{.mark} [for the state actors who
launch them]{.underline}.

As I mention in Sect. 3.1, stability of cyberspace hinges on both
regulations and strategies. Having considered the limits of the existing
approaches to the regulation of state behaviour in cyberspace, I shall
now focus on existing view for the designing deterrence strategies for
cyber attacks.

### Deterrence DA\-\--AT: OCOs Good

#### Mistrust and uncertainty means deterrence [fails]{.underline} now\-\--AFF enables [OCO effectiveness]{.underline} 

Patrik **Maldre 16**, Adjunct Fellow at the Center for European Policy
Analysis (CEPA), where he leads the CEPA Cyber Defense Initiative,

European Policy Analysis, Cyber Intelligence Brief No. 1, May 2016,

[[Deterrence]{.mark} aims to discourage an adversary from taking
offensive action]{.underline}. Traditionally, [its two pillars have been
deterrence-by-denial and deterrence-by-punishment]{.underline}. The
first refers to measures that reduce or eliminate the benefits of a
certain aggressive move, while the second seeks to impose additional
costs for performing it. NATO's traditional mandate of defending its own
systems fits comfortably into the deterrence-by-denial part of this
framework. [Deterrence-by-punishment]{.underline}, however,
[is]{.underline} far more [controversial because of the problem of
attribution]{.underline}---which refers to the difficulty of identifying
the perpetrators of operations. Finally, [both concepts]{.underline}
also [[rely on]{.mark} **intent**]{.underline},
[**[capability]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[credibility]{.underline}**]{.mark}. As it stands, [[a **palpable**
**lack of trust**]{.underline} **[among member
s]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[tates]{.underline}** **[[hinders collective
action]{.underline}]{.mark}** [on both fronts.]{.underline} Progress in
the denial category will be easier and more visible, but countermeasures
should be considered as well.

NATO has come a long way in terms of working together to shore up
technical defenses in cyberspace. The main barrier to further
cooperation, however, is the difference in technical and administrative
capacities as well as human and financial resources among member states.
This, along with differing national views, remains the main barrier to
further integration. The alliance is only as strong as its weakest
member. When it comes to deterrence-by-denial, therefore, all member
states must have the basics in place: computer security laws, national
cyber strategies, a police focus on cybercrime, national CERTs,
public-private partnerships and capable intelligence agencies. From
there, members should enact effective, actionable information-sharing
programs. After that, the next step is to develop joint situational
awareness. Typically, adversary espionage campaigns target multiple NATO
and memberstate organizations simultaneously. Early warning and shared
situational awareness can prevent multiple entities in different
countries from being breached by the same operation. The end goal for
the denial part of the deterrence strategy is, of course, resilience. If
NATO and its members can effectively work together to prevent, detect,
respond and recover from cyber attacks, this would significantly
decrease the benefits and increase the costs for an adversary. NATO
collective action should continue in this direction, and joint efforts
can help to promote trust and confidence---a key ingredient in further
cooperation in deterrence-by-denial, but even more crucial when it comes
to deterrence-by-punishment.

Preventing adversaries from benefitting from offensive actions, or at
least limiting their gains, can help discourage them from conducting
such attacks in the first place. Punishing them after the fact is
another. While the term has an aggressive connotation, this part of the
strategy is defensive and retaliatory in nature. It can refer to a broad
spectrum of actions---from naming-and-shaming to nuclear strikes. In the
cyber domain, the problem of attribution hinders the goal of effective
deterrence. For this reason, NATO and its member states should invest
heavily in the technological and analytical capabilities necessary to
discern signs of a particular adversary, including in cooperation with
the private sector.

As numerous cases of attribution to Russian cyber threat actors
demonstrate, this is already taking place. Furthermore, member states
should complement technical attribution with political and diplomatic
attribution. Currently, months and even years pass before politicians
and leaders feel comfortable about ascribing blame. For deterrence to
work, however, governments must carry out both high-level and private
attribution in conjunction with media and private companies as soon as
they have conclusive evidence. Calling out threat actors and their state
sponsors in diplomatic forums, public discussions and private meetings
can motivate them to conduct less aggressive operations.

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and its member states
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[adopt]{.underline} **[joint
approaches]{.underline}** [to **developing**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} **[employing]{.underline}** **[[offensive
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for collective defense]{.underline}
purposes. Laudably, [many **[individual allies]{.mark}** have already
[declared]{.mark} that [they possess such capabilities]{.mark} and the
doctrines for using them. **[However]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[considerable [mistrust]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[persists
among]{.mark} the [allies]{.mark}, [creating]{.mark} an atmosphere of
[**uncertainty** and **doubt**]{.mark}]{.underline}[---[which **weakens
deterrence**]{.underline}]{.mark} as a whole. To overcome this hurdle,
allies can begin by making political statements about potentially using
these capabilities in case of attack, and in accordance with
international law as part of a collective defense response. Ultimately,
NATO should move toward sharing these capabilities, perhaps by using
existing models based on nuclear doctrine.
**[Transparency]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[[straightforwardness]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in this arena
[could]{.mark} contribute substantively to **[deter]{.mark}ring
[adversaries]{.mark}** [and **reinforce**]{.mark} **[collective
defense]{.mark}** among NATO members.]{.underline}

**[Intent]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[credibility]{.underline}**
[will **play into adversaries' calculations** for any type of
countermeasure. For this reason, **[policy]{.mark}** innovations
[and]{.mark} **[capability development]{.mark}** [need to be
**complemented** by **effective strategic
communication**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [You cannot achieve deterrence if
your adversary]{.underline} **[doubts that you'll do what you
say]{.underline}**--- [and even less so if it doesn't think you can do
what you say]{.underline}. From this perspective, demonstrations such as
the Aurora test in 2007 can be quite useful.21 Other, more subtle means
include presentations by top officials at security conferences.
Operations against third-party adversaries other than the intended
target of deterrence can also deter attacks; few doubt that Russia paid
close attention to the Stuxnet case, or that NATO drew conclusions from
the Ukraine grid attack. In sum, effective strategic communication---
both public and private---can be a key component or complement of a
deterrence-by-punishment strategy.

### Deterrence DA\-\--AT: Revisionism

#### [If]{.underline} Russia [is]{.underline} revisionist deterrence [inevitably fails]{.underline} and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy that risks war

**CATO 20**, "Security Threats in Contemporary World Politics: Potential
Hegemons, Partnerships, and Primacy," CATO Institute, 5/6/20,
https://www.cato.org/publications/publications/security-threats-contemporary-world-politics-potential-hegemons

[The]{.underline} **[Dangers]{.underline}** [of American
Alliances]{.underline}

[Primacy poses **more dangers**]{.underline} [than]{.underline} [simply
**failing** to achieve its goals]{.underline}. **[Failed regional
management]{.underline}** [may well **induce** American policymakers to
**fight**]{.underline}, either [to **end the wars** they **could not
prevent**]{.underline} or for other reasons. Here, I highlight [two
considerations]{.underline} that [might drive such a decision: (a)
concerns about the **credibility** of American commitments]{.underline}
[and (b) **expanding definitions** of American **core
interests.**]{.underline}

[Primacy depends heavily on **credibility**:]{.underline} [the belief
among interested actors that, in the final reckoning, the United States
**will go to war**]{.underline} [to protect the status quo it has
promised to defend]{.underline}. A related important belief is that the
United States will go to war only to protect the status quo it has
promised to defend. A primacy strategy engages in a combination of
"extended" and "pivotal" deterrence: it [aims to convince revisionists
of all stripes of American willingness to **punish** those who seek to
**overturn the status quo**.]{.underline}

As discussed earlier, the world with revisionist states motivated enough
to make primacy useful will also be one where American credibility is
open to question. [**[Offensive realist states]{.mark}** [will be
motivated by]{.mark} a view of **[uncertainty]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} [[sees alliances as]{.mark} often
**[unreliable]{.mark} alternatives** to **self‐​help**]{.underline}.
[States with non‐​security motives will]{.underline} [have good reason to
believe that they **hold the balance of resolve** on non‐​security issues
**far from American shores.**]{.underline} [In either case, there will
be **ample [reason]{.mark}** []{.mark}for risk**‐​acceptant revisionist
states** [to]{.mark} **consider [gambl]{.mark}ing [against]{.mark}
[American intervention]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[To be clear, [revisionists would **not**]{.mark} be
**[doub]{.mark}ting** [U.S. capabilities]{.mark},]{.underline} although
clever diplomatic and military strategies might lead them to believe
they could temporarily revise the status quo. [Rather, revisionists
[would doubt]{.mark} that [America's **interests** were **large
enough**]{.mark} [to **justify the costs of war**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Daryl Press, who generally emphasizes the decisive influence of power
considerations in deterrence decisions, argues that "[adversaries will
doubt whether the United States will take costly actions to defend
interests of **secondary** or **tertiary** importance]{.underline}." [A
good historical example is the German military's view of the
Anschluss]{.underline}. [Even though senior Wehrmacht officers believed
that Britain and France **could intervene** and defeat Germany during an
invasion of Austria]{.underline}, [they endorsed Hitler's plans, largely
because they **doubted** that the Western powers would **risk
war**]{.underline} over the unification of German speaking peoples in
one country.37

[[In the event]{.mark} that **[deterrence fails]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[what will Washington do when faced with a challenge to the status quo?
There is good reason to believe that [policymakers will **follow through
on**]{.mark} **their [commitments]{.mark},** even though the costs of
war may be quite **disproportionate to American stakes** in the issue
under dispute]{.underline}. [After all, [wouldn't a failure to
defend]{.mark} the status quo [**reveal** the]{.mark} entire [primacy
strategy to be a **bluff**?]{.mark}]{.underline} [Revisionist states
might be expected to **draw that conclusion,**]{.underline} [no matter
how the United States framed the situation.]{.underline} One does not
need to believe that states carefully monitor each other's past actions
in order to draw inferences about likely future behavior to credit that
notion. [Backing down over a commitment might **clarify** for many
interested parties American interests in **defending other
commitments**]{.underline}---[all far from U.S. shores and protecting
interests far more important to others than to Washington--- **that look
just like it.**]{.underline}

[**Regardless** of whether revisionist states make such inferences, it
is crystal clear that **American decisionmakers** **believe they
do.**]{.underline} Harry Truman's decision to intervene in Korea was
driven by the belief that the Soviet Union would draw inferences about
American willingness to fight. "If we let Korea down," Truman argued,
"the Soviet will keep right on going and swallow up one piece of Asia
after another. If we were to let Asia go, the Near East would collapse
and no telling what would happen in Europe." Conversely, "if we are
tough enough now, if we stand up to them like we did in Greece three
years ago, they won't take any next steps."38 The American commitment in
Vietnam hinged on credibility concerns as well, especially with regard
to what its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would
think. Lyndon Johnson believed that escalation was required because "to
leave Vietnam to its fate would shake the confidence of all these people
\[i.e., other U.S. allies\] in the value of an American commitment."
Richard Nixon believed he had to stay in Vietnam because "the cause of
peace might not survive the damage that would be done to other nations'
confidence in our reliability." And John Kennedy was willing to risk
nuclear war in the Cuban missile crisis because "for us to fail to
respond would throw into question our willingness to respond over
Berlin."39

### Deterrence DA\-\--AT: Hybrid Impact

#### OCOs are terrible at deterring hybrid activities

Jeppe T. **Jacobsen 21**, Ph.D. candidate at the Danish Institute for
International Studies and the Center for War Studies at the University
of Southern Denmark, worked as cyber coordinator at the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of Denmark where he coordinated Denmark's cyber
diplomacy, "Cyber Offense in NATO: Challenges and Opportunities,"
International Affairs, vol. 97, no. 3, 05/01/2021, pp. 703--720

Deterring cyber activity below the threshold of collective defence

'[Hybrid' has become a popular concept when describing the current
threat environment]{.underline}. While discussions over the definition,
novelty and usefulness of the concept continue, [there seems to be
agreement that, when used to qualify 'threat' or 'warfare', 'hybrid'
refers to the blurring of the distinction between military and
civilian]{.underline}, often in relation to the mixture of instruments
used to obtain political objectives.62 NATO's attempt to deter military
and paramilitary instruments from being deployed has already been
touched upon above. [As a primarily military alliance]{.underline},
however, [NATO is facing **difficulty**]{.underline} [in addressing the
instruments that are used **deliberately to stay below the threshold of
collective defence**]{.underline}.

[NATO has **not been able to deter**]{.underline} [the perpetration of
**random ransomware incidents**]{.underline}, **[election
interference]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[targeted propaganda
campaigns]{.underline}** [through **hacks and leaks**, or]{.underline}
**[industrial cyber espionage]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
[**intrusion into critical infrastructures**. The alliance's
**conventional capabilities**]{.underline} [are]{.underline} **[not
credible]{.underline}** (proportional) **[responses]{.underline}** [to
such malicious cyber activity. Thus, it has responded only by 'naming
and shaming', and by expressing encouragement to member states to
enhance]{.underline} the **[resilience]{.underline}** of their
networks.63 [These responses, however, have **yet to prove
effective**]{.underline} [in halting the malicious cyber activity
conducted **below the threshold**]{.underline} of collective defence.64
And the introduction of SCEPVA is not likely to change that; the
integration of cyber effects is tied to NATO military operations only.
[While NATO member states are already compelled to maintain a level
of]{.underline} **[cooperation]{.underline}** [in collective
defence]{.underline} (article 3), [and to]{.underline}
**[consult]{.underline}** together [whenever any of them feels that its
territorial integrity, political independence or security is
threatened]{.underline} (article 4), [NATO---with or without integrated
cyber effects---is]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** an alliance
**[designed to deal with non-military threats from a peer
competitor]{.underline}**.

### Deterrence DA\-\--AT: Signaling

#### Civilian leaderships are terrible at using cyberweapons for political signaling because they don't understand their military context or operational effects.

Civil-Military Relations and the Risks of Cyber Signaling in Nuclear
Crises

But what if a state, such as the United States, wanted a cyber operation
to be visible to an adversary, such as Russia, during a nuclear crisis
--- in other words, to send a cyber signal?

[Signaling is]{.underline} **[essential for coercive
diplomacy]{.underline}** and international crises because it helps
states convey their intent to one another. The civil-military relations
literature has found that civilian (rather than military) leaders are
more inclined to use military force as a form of signaling, rather than
for operational effect.

Why does this matter? [When civilian and military leaders
have]{.underline} [**different views**, **civilians**]{.underline}
[could make decisions around using military force for]{.underline}
**[signaling]{.underline}** purposes [in a way that]{.underline}
**[exacerbates ongoing crises]{.underline}**. For instance, [writing
about]{.underline} **[Cold War]{.underline}** **[nuclear]{.underline}**
[crises]{.underline}, Scott Sagan has shown that
**[civilian]{.underline}** [decision-makers have made crises **more
dangerous**]{.underline} [by taking actions without]{.underline} fully
[understanding the]{.underline} **[military implications]{.underline}**
[and risks of]{.underline} **[inadvertent escalation]{.underline}**.
Jack Levy, writing about the causes of World War I, discusses how,
[during the]{.underline} **[July Crisis]{.underline}** preceding the
outbreak of war, [civilians saw military]{.underline}
**[mobilization]{.underline}** [as a political tool for]{.underline}
[**coercive diplomacy**, whereas]{.underline} **[military]{.underline}**
[leaders]{.underline}, who were [focused on]{.underline} the
**[operational]{.underline}** [implications, perceived mobilization as a
means of **preparing for imminent war**]{.underline}.

[Differences in how civilian and military leaders see the use of
military power are]{.underline} likely to be **[even more salient in
cyberspace]{.underline}**, for three reasons. First, [cyberspace
is]{.underline} a **[highly technical]{.underline}** environment where
[civilians typically]{.underline} **[lack subject matter
expertise]{.underline}**. **[Practitioners]{.underline}** are
[likely]{.underline} to [have far **more up-to-date**]{.underline}
operational **[experience]{.underline}** [and, therefore,
**fluency**]{.underline} [with]{.underline} the **[technical
issues]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[constraints]{.underline}**
posed by cyber operations than civilian leaders (even those with prior
and, potentially, outmoded experience). [Cyberspace is also]{.underline}
a [highly]{.underline} **[classified]{.underline}** environment --- one
in which information is highly segmented and only accessible to a select
group of individuals. Therefore, some civilian officials may not be
privy to all of the details surrounding cyber operations. Finally,
[unlike other technical and secretive environments, cyberspace has an
**additional**]{.underline} [element that makes it even more difficult
for non-experts to grasp its nature. Specifically, cyberspace
is]{.underline} also an **[esoteric]{.underline}** environment; [cyber
operations and their effects are **not easily visible**]{.underline} in
a way that other types of military capabilities are, making it difficult
to conceptualize their utility in a tangible manner.

There is evidence supporting this idea. For instance,
[senior]{.underline} **[civilian leaders]{.underline}**
[across]{.underline} **[multiple]{.underline}** U.S.
**[administrations]{.underline}**, as well as in Congress, typically
[describe cyber operations as useful for **signaling**]{.underline}
deterrence and resolve. Chris Inglis, the Biden administration's
inaugural National Cyber Director, described how he'd "like to change
the decision calculus of those who transgress in this space," and
contemplated that "\[p\]erhaps our actions should be felt by an
adversary. They should know that they have just felt the hand of
whomever." Similarly, Senator Angus King, discussing the threat of
Russian-linked ransomware attacks in the summer of 2021, noted that he
wants "somebody ... in the Politburo to say, 'Gee, boss, I'm not sure we
ought to do this because we're liable to get whacked in some way by
those Americans.'"

John Bolton, former national security advisor under President Donald
Trump, in multiple public statements, has depicted the purpose of U.S.
cyber operations --- especially offensive ones --- as a means of
influencing adversary perception. He described how the employment of
offensive cyber power creates "structures of deterrence, so that it's
publicly known," and that "it is important that our adversaries know
\[that\] ...we have authorized offensive cyber operations to ...
demonstrate to our adversaries that the costs of engaging in operations
against us is higher than they want to bear." Michael Daniel, the Obama
administration's cyber czar, depicted the purpose of imposing costs on
Russia in response to its 2016 election interference as "to openly
demonstrate that we could do it as a deterrent and also clandestinely
disrupt their operations as well."

In contrast, [while some military leaders do talk about cyber
deterrence, the language they employ is anchored in **tactical and
operational objectives**, rather than aiming to influence
adversary]{.underline} **[perception]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[decision-making]{.underline}**. This is evident in how both civilian
and military leaders use the language of "imposing costs." Military
leaders tend to describe cost-imposition as supporting the disruption,
degradation, denial, or destruction of adversary offensive capabilities
and operations. For instance, in December 2021, Gen. Paul Nakasone,
commander of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security
Agency (NSA), described "imposing costs" against Russian-linked
ransomware groups as the goal in itself. The month prior, at the
November 2021 Aspen Security Forum, he argued for the United States to
impose costs in cyberspace, but stated that a traditional deterrence
strategy "does not comport to cyberspace." In another example, in 2019,
Lt. Gen. Stephen Fogarty, commander of Army Cyber Command, voiced
skepticism about cyber deterrence in remarks about defending the 2020
elections against cyber interference, noting that "I don't know of a
single thing we could do that would prevent \[adversaries\] from
competing, but I want to impose as much cost on them as possible."

Implications for the Ukraine Crisis and Beyond

[What are the implications]{.underline} of this [for the
current]{.underline} Ukraine [crisis?]{.underline} Thus far, [while
cyber operations have been used on]{.underline} **[both
sides]{.underline}** of the conflict, [they have]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** [played a **decisive role on the
battlefield**]{.underline}. So far, the United States has been focused
on providing cyber defense support to Ukraine and NATO, reportedly to
include dispatching Cyber Command's cyber mission teams to Eastern
Europe, as well as seeking to deter potential Russian cyber retaliation
in response to U.S. and Western sanctions, especially attacks on U.S.
critical infrastructure.

[However, if the **nuclear dimension**]{.underline} of the crisis
[becomes more acute, policymakers may be]{.underline}
**[tempted]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[turn to
cyber]{.underline}** operations [to]{.underline} **[signal
resolve]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[deter Russia]{.underline}**
in the nuclear domain. [Such an approach could be]{.underline}
**[seen]{.underline}** [as]{.underline} particularly
**[appealing]{.underline}** precisely [because cyber operations
are]{.underline} **[not kinetic]{.underline}** [and,
therefore,]{.underline} **[less dangerous]{.underline}** than other
military moves. [But this could have the]{.underline} **[inverse
effect]{.underline}** [of making]{.underline} **[nuclear
escalation]{.underline}**, rather than deterrence, **[more
likely]{.underline}**, for the following reasons.

In 2020, [Russia clarified its nuclear declaratory policy to state that
Russia]{.underline} [**reserves the right to use nuclear weapons under a
range of contingencies**, including]{.underline} an adversary attack
against "critical governmental or military sites of the Russian
Federation, disruption of which would undermine nuclear forces' response
actions." Cynthia Roberts has suggested that this particular scenario
"likely include\[s\] **[cyber attacks]{.underline}** against command and
control infrastructure and/or attempted leadership decapitation."
Similarly, Dmitry Stefanovich wrote that "[\[t\]here is]{.underline} a
**[wide consensus]{.underline}** [within the Russian expert community
that this]{.underline} also **[includes]{.underline}** possible **[cyber
threats]{.underline}** as well as other non-nuclear dangers."
Interestingly, [Russia's declaratory policy contains parallels to the
implicit link between cyber attacks and nuclear use contained in
the]{.underline} 2018 **[U.S. N]{.underline}**uclear
**[P]{.underline}**osture **[R]{.underline}**eview. That document notes
that the United States would consider using nuclear weapons under
"extreme circumstances," including "significant non-nuclear strategic
attacks ... \[such as\] attacks on U.S. or allied nuclear forces, their
command and control, or warning and attack assessment capabilities."

Therefore, [a hypothetical attempt by the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to conduct a cyber
operation]{.underline} against Russian nuclear command, control, and
communication systems [for]{.underline} **[signaling]{.underline}**
[purposes, such as to]{.underline} **[demonstrate resolve]{.underline}**
or convey a desire to deter the use of nuclear weapons [could
in]{.underline} **[practice]{.underline}** [make]{.underline} their
**[use more likely]{.underline}**. Unlike most cyber operations, which
rely on secrecy, **[signals]{.underline}** [are meant to be]{.underline}
[**seen**. And]{.underline} to be sufficiently credible, this kind of
cyber operation [would have to demonstrate an ability to cause
a]{.underline} **[meaningful effect]{.underline}** against Russia's
nuclear systems, rather than a low-cost, unsophisticated cyber
operation. Therefore, [assuming such an attack were feasible, the
chances are]{.underline} **[greater]{.underline}** in this scenario
[that Russia could interpret U.S. cyber signals as an]{.underline}
**[attack]{.underline}** against its critical military systems.

### Deterrence DA\-\--UQ

#### NATO is [unable]{.underline} to respond to Russian grey zone threats -- decision making time is too slow

Author and / or Article Point of View:  The author believes that the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's ([NATO]{.underline}) [**[Article
5]{.underline}** [does not provide the agility for]{.underline}]{.mark}
forward deployed **[forces to effectively respond to]{.underline}**
challenges below the threshold of war. These challenges are also known
as **[[Grey Zone activities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This paper is a
summation of a chapter the author wrote for publication at the NATO
Staff College in Rome, regarding NATO in the Grey Zone, which was edited
Dr Howard Coombes, Royal Military College of Canada.

Summary:  [[Russia has been careful]{.underline}]{.mark}, for the most
part, [[to avoid direct confrontation]{.mark} with NATO]{.underline}.
[[The]{.mark} Russian focus on [indirect mechanisms targets the
**weaknesses of NATO's**]{.mark} conventional]{.underline}
**[response]{.underline}** [and highlights the requirement to **revisit
Article 5**]{.underline} within context of the deployed enhanced Forward
Presence Activities. [[Conflict through]{.mark} competitive and [Grey
Zone activities is omnipresent and does not **follow the template that
Article 5 was designed for**]{.mark}]{.underline}\[1\] .

Text:  U.S. Army Major General Eric J. Wesley, Commander, U.S. Army
Futures Command, has noted that [western militaries]{.underline} and
governments may [need to adjust between a "continuum of conflict" that
denotes "war" and "peace"]{.underline} to an age of constant competition
and covert pressure punctuated by short violent overt struggle\[2\]. The
Chief of the Russian General Staff, General Valery Gerasimov reflected
upon this approach for the Russian military journal VPK in 2013.
"**[Methods of conflict]{.underline}**," wrote Gerasimov, **[have
changed]{.underline}**, [and now involve "the broad use of]{.underline}
political, economic, informational, humanitarian and other [non-military
measures]{.underline}." All of this, he said, could be supplemented by
utilizing the local populace as a fifth column and by "concealed" armed
forces\[3\]. These [actions demonstrate a Russian philosophy of
achieving]{.underline} political [objectives by employing a combination
of attributable/non-attributable military and other
actions]{.underline}. Operating under the threshold of traditional
warfare, these adversarial behaviours, known as **[[Grey Zone
activities]{.underline}]{.mark}**, deliberately **[[target the
weaknesses of]{.mark} the traditional [NATO
responses]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[Reactions to aggression are governed by Article 5]{.underline} of the
North Atlantic Treaty. Article 5 provides the Alliance's collective
defence paradigm, stating an "attack on one is an attack on all,"
signaling the shared intent to deal with armed aggression
vigorously\[4\]. [**[Article 5 does not address Grey Zone
activities]{.underline}** [that demand **rapid**, **unified decision
making**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and **action**]{.underline}. [NATO crisis
response is predicated on a system that acts in a predictable and
deliberate manner to deal with overt aggression]{.underline}. [Though
NATO has recognized the Grey Zone]{.underline} **[[there has been little
adaption to this threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [**[NATO has not
demonstrated that it is prepared]{.underline}** [to act]{.underline}
**[decisively]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in the case of a Russian **Grey
Zone incursion**]{.underline}. [The NATO forces positioned to deter
potential Russian aggression]{.underline} on the Alliance's eastern
flank [are]{.underline} the enhanced Forward Presence
([eFP]{.underline}) [battle groups]{.underline}. This military
commitment is structured and authorized to counter overt Article 5
threats. Paradoxically, the most likely danger they may encounter are
Grey Zone challenges. [[Combine this]{.mark} capability to likely threat
mismatch [with the **speed** at which]{.mark} political and military
[decisions are required during crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, like a
limited Russian incursion with pre-conditions set by Grey Zone actions,
and **[[NATO may not be able to react
effectively]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Consequently, [it may be time for
NATO to **re-visit**]{.underline} its current **[Article
5]{.underline}** deterrence activities, [in the context of Grey Zone
activities]{.underline}. This re-visit would acknowledge the Eastern
NATO nations require every opportunity to answer any form of threat to
their security and fully enable the NATO forces arrayed within their
countries.

Presently, the enhanced Forward Presence is an 'activity' and not an
NATO mission. The forces remain under national control for all, but
specifically pre-agreed tasks and lack common funding resources. For all
intents and purposes NATO missions, with the exceptions of "operational
limitations," indicating national caveats or activities in which a
contributing nation will not participate, contribute to a single
military force under a unified NATO command structure. In the eFP
context, this unified command structure does not exist. Outside of an
invocation of an Article 5 response, the various elements of the eFP
battle groups remain under national command. The Russian determination
of conflict leans towards a state of constant, below the threshold of
war competition utilizing deception, information, proxies, and avoiding
attributable action. [**Russian efforts are focussed** on NATO's
greatest vulnerability]{.underline} and, at times, source of
frustration, **[[lengthy centralized
deliberation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [At the best of times this need for
consensus [creates **slow decision making**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
resultantly a diminution of strategic, operational, and tactical
agility\[6\]. **[If]{.underline}** the Russian trend of **[Grey Zone
actions continue]{.underline}**, **[Article 5 responses by [the Alliance
may become irrelevant]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[due to this
slowness]{.mark} of decision making]{.underline}. For the eFP
battlegroups, which can react to conventional threats, the Grey Zone
poses difficult challenges, which were not fully recognized when the eFP
concept was originally proposed and implemented\[7\].

The Baltic countries are strengthened by having eFP forces garrisoned
within their nations, but **[there is [a capability gap]{.mark} in
providing Article 5 deterrence]{.underline}**. The [lack of
authority]{.underline} for eFP battle groups [to compete below the
threshold of conflict [leaves]{.mark} **Baltic [allies
uncertain]{.mark}** if and how NATO can support them]{.underline}.
Enhanced Forward Presence battle groups are not currently able to deal
with Grey Zone eventualities. Consequently, in several important
aspects, the Alliance response remains handicapped. Bringing about
achieving rapid consensus for a crisis response operations in the face
of an ambiguous attack, or in response to ostensibly unrelated low-level
provocations, like those imbued in the Grey Zone, will not be an easy
task in the current framework\[8\].

#### Crimea and Ukraine prove

Is This War

[[NATO worries]{.mark} that [hybrid war]{.mark} can inch toward a
geopolitical objective while [remain]{.mark}ing **[under]{.mark} the
[threshold for Article 5,]{.mark}**]{.underline} which triggers
collective armed defense of a threatened member.

[Russia's [incursion in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[Crimea]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Ukraine]{.underline}** [is a **case in
point**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It was rooted in the Russian determination
that blocking Ukraine's further economic and political integration into
Europe was a vital interest.

[It began with misdirection. As protests roiled Ukraine in early 2014,
Russia mounted a **large military exercise**]{.underline} [within
striking distance of the Ukraine border]{.underline}. [This
**distracted** the]{.underline} [newly installed pro-Western government
in Kiev]{.underline}, as the Russian force was big enough that the
exercise was a plausible preinvasion movement.

[Meanwhile]{.underline}, the [[little green men]{.mark}
[appeared]{.mark}, and [Moscow began to close its grip]{.mark} on
Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula]{.underline}. After it became apparent what
was happening, the nearby Russian force helped dissuade Kiev from
mounting its own military move to try and forestall Crimea's fall.

On March 1 President Vladimir [Putin orchestrated a Russian referendum
authorizing him to use force in Ukraine.]{.underline} Regular infantry
units moved into Crimea, covered by airpower from the Russian Black Sea
fleet.

[Meanwhile, [Russia]{.mark} successfully exploited the information
dimension of the conflict,]{.underline} according to a 2015 NATO study
of hybrid war incidents. [It [flooded]{.mark} [local media with
**propaganda**]{.mark}]{.underline} [depicting Moscow as the protector
of Russian-language residents of the region]{.underline}, [who were
depicted as threatened by potential atrocities.]{.underline}

[This]{.underline} sort of [propaganda has [made Putin]{.mark} hugely
[popular]{.mark} in Russia [and]{.mark} may have [helped **deter the
West**]{.mark}]{.underline} from a more muscular support of Ukraine.

craft legal storylines to support their national security objectives on
a regular basis.279 Although the idea that such verbal strategies are as
important as military strategies may push the point too far,280 [the
**significance** of **legal narratives** and counter-narratives for
opening up certain courses of action and for foreclosing others must not
be **underestimated**]{.underline}. If anything, the progressive
legalization of the conduct of foreign affairs and the vastly increased
public interest in the legality of military action,281 amplified by

### Deterrence DA\-\--Cyberdeterrence Fails

#### Cyberdeterrence fails\-\--'meatspace' concepts don't translate into the digital environment. 

Soesanto **Stefan 22**, senior cyber defense researcher at the Center
for Security Studies (CSS), ETH Zürich, Switzerland, currently working

Deterrence Revisited," ETH Zurich, 04/07/2022, p. 49 p.

Cross-Domain Deterrence

**[Cross-domain]{.underline}** [deterrence describes the spectrum of
strategic measures a nation-state is willing to leverage
**outside**]{.underline} the **[cyber]{.underline}** domain [in
**reaction** to an event **inside cyber**]{.underline}space. [Actions
can range from]{.underline} criminal **[indictments]{.underline}** of
cyber operatives [and **trolling campaigns**]{.underline} in the
information warfare space [to]{.underline} imposing [**economic
sanctions** and]{.underline} launching **[retaliatory nuclear
strikes]{.underline}**.83

[The primary **problem** with cross-domain deterrence is ascertaining
**whether** such measures will **deter future aggression** in cyberspace
or result in **spillover effects** that **remove**]{.underline}
long-standing **[deterrence]{.underline}** mechanisms
**[elsewhere]{.underline}**. Spearheaded by the US Department Justice
(DOJ), the indictment of nationstate cyber operatives for crimes
committed against US-based entities has become the focal point to hold
individuals personally liable for their actions and orders followed.
Some analysts claim this is evidence of a concerted naming and shaming
strategy by the US government (i.e., deterrence by delegitimization).
However, the DOJ's overarching legal aim is, and has always been, to
attribute attacks and hold individuals accountable in a US
court---whether adversarial cyber operators that hit non-military
targets or foreign civilians that hit US entities. Tonya Ugoretz, deputy
assistant director of the FBI's Cyber Division, aptly states, "nothing
says attribution like an indictment."84

While nation-state cyber operatives indicted by the DOJ have remained
outside the reach of US law enforcement, two cases stand out for
counterintelligence purpose. Although not per se a "cyber" operative,
the case of Yanjun Xu, deputy division director at the Chinese Ministry
of State Security's Sixth Bureau in Jiangsu Province, highlights that
the DOJ's indictments of foreign government operatives can net results
abroad. Arrested in Brussels, Belgium, on April 1, 2018, Xu was
extradited to the United States on October 9th.85 According to US
officials, Xu's extradition marked the first time a Chinese spy has been
brought to the US to face prosecution.86 On November 5, 2021, a federal
jury convicted Xu of "conspiring and attempting to commit economic
espionage and steal trade secrets from multiple U.S. aviation and
aerospace companies."87 He is currently awaiting sentencing. The second
case concerns Vladislav Klyushin, a Russian businessman and first deputy
director of cybersecurity company M-13. Klyushin was arrested in
Switzerland on March 21, 2021, on the request of US authorities who
charged him with "alleged involvement in a global scheme to trade on
non-public information stolen from U.S. computer networks that netted
tens of millions of dollars in illegal profits."88 While waiting for his
extradition hearing, Swiss news outlet 24heures reported that former GRU
(Russian intelligence agency) operative Ivan Sergeyevich
Yermakov---wanted by the FBI for hacking into the DNC and interfering in
the 2016 US presidential election---was actually employed by M-13.89
Following Klyushin's extradition to the United States in December 2021,
CNN reported in January 2020 that according to former US officials,
Klyushin "could be a valuable asset in US efforts to gather more
information on Russian interference in the 2016 election as well as
other intelligence operations."90 Similarly, Assistant US Attorney Seth
B. Kosto argued at Klyushin's pretrial hearing in Boston that "we do
submit that he's not simply any Russian citizen. . . . He is a Russian
citizen who is employing a former military intelligence officer, who has
a photograph in his internet service provider records of a medal of
honor from the president of the Russian Federation."91

The US Treasury Department by contrast has been leveraging targeted
economic sanctions since April 2015, when President Obama signed
Executive Order 13694 and declared a national emergency to deal with the
"increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled
activities originating from . . . outside the United States \[that\]
constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,
foreign policy, and economy of the United States."92 In December 2016,
EO13757 amended EO13694 "to include an Annex of sanctioned persons and
to expand the scope of cyber-enabled activities subject to sanctions."93
Other cyber-related sanction programs followed in subsequent years,
including EO13722, Blocking Property of the Government of North Korea
and the Workers' Party of Korea, and Prohibiting Certain Transactions
With Respect to North Korea (March 2016) and the Countering America's
Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (August 2017). Since then, the Office
of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has imposed cyber-related sanctions on
close to 200 individuals and companies hailing from China, Iran, North
Korea, and Russia.94 Thus far, none of the countries in question have
discernably decreased their cyber-related activities vis-à-vis the
United States.

The European Union has partially emulated the US approach with EU
Council Decision 2019/797 and Regulation 2019/796 of May 2019 on
"restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its
Member States."95 As of this writing, the council has imposed two cyber
sanction packages that imposed asset freezes and travel restrictions on
those listed. The first package on June 30, 2020, listed six individuals
and two entities for the OPCW hack, WannaCry, NotPetya, and APT10's
CloudHopper campaign.96 The second package was imposed on October 22,
2020, against two GRU officers and the GRU's Unit 26165 for the 2015
Bundestag hack.97 Similar to the sanctions imposed by the US Treasury
Department, it is currently entirely unclear what kind, if any, effects
EU cyber sanctions produce on the adversarial end. In contrast to US
sanctions, EU restrictive measures do not serve as a vehicle for public
attribution, as the decision to attribute or not remains a sovereign
political decision of the individual EU member states. As of this
writing, the EU nonetheless continues to argue in document after
document that sanctions are "intended to prevent, discourage, deter and
respond to continuing and increasing malicious behaviour in
cyberspace."98 Probably most insightful when it comes to deterrence in
this context is the UK's National Cyber Strategy 2022. It acknowledged
for the first time that "the development of the autonomous UK cyber
sanctions regime has added another disruptive tool that we have used to
respond to incidents such as the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks. However,
despite all this, our approach to cyber deterrence does not yet seem to
have fundamentally altered the risk calculus for attackers."99

[While it is]{.underline} indeed **[tempting]{.underline}** [to
cross-connect preexisting deterrence frameworks elsewhere to the cyber
domain, it is]{.underline} **[highly questionable]{.underline}**
[whether the]{.underline} **[outcome]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} a
**[more robust deterrence]{.underline}** posture [in cyberspace
or]{.underline} a **[weakening]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} the
[deterrence]{.underline} posture [in **real**]{.underline}
[space]{.underline}. For example, [connecting **nuclear** deterrence
to]{.underline} the **[cyber]{.underline}** domain [is]{.underline}
probably an area where it could in fact be
**[destabilizing]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[counterproductive]{.underline}**. In January 2018, the New York Times
reported that the language used in a draft of the 2018 US Nuclear
Posture Review would "permit the use of nuclear weapons to respond to a
wide range of devastating but non-nuclear attacks on American
infrastructure, including what current and former government officials
described as the most crippling kind of cyberattacks."100 Amy Zegart,
senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, questioned at the time, ["Do
we]{.underline} **[really]{.underline}** [think the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates government [would
launch a]{.underline} **[nuclear retaliatory strike]{.underline}**
[after a cyberattack of]{.underline} **[how ever consequential
damage]{.underline}** might be on the United States**[?]{.underline}**
[. . . Lots of]{.underline} **[debate]{.underline}** [about that. Is
that]{.underline} **[really]{.underline}** a **[robust
deterrence]{.underline}** strategy**[?]{.underline}** Probably
**[no]{.underline}**t."101

Similarly, Harknett and Fischerkeller argued in 2017 that
**[expanding]{.underline}** [deterrence to "include threats of **law
enforcement**]{.underline} [penalties, sanctions, and 'name and shame'
approaches---denoted as whole-of-government deterrence--- should be
**recognized for what it is**---the]{.underline} **[addition of
weaker]{.underline}** forms of **[punishment]{.underline}**
[because]{.underline} **[robust]{.underline}** [costs]{.underline}
[**cannot be credibly imposed**. Adding to a menu of]{.underline}
**[weak options]{.underline}** [does]{.underline} [**not make deterrence
stronger**; it only]{.underline} **[reveals]{.underline}** [its
inherent]{.underline} **[incompatibility]{.underline}** [with
the]{.underline} **[challenge of]{.underline}** the
**[\[cyber\]]{.underline}** domain."102

Having critically dismantled six deterrence mechanisms that have emerged
over the past years, let us now turn to the questions of when cyber
deterrence is deemed theoretically successful and when it is not.

When Is Cyber Deterrence Successful?

Testifying before the House Committee on Armed Services in 2017, RAND's
Martin Libicki carefully explained that a successful deterrence posture
in cyberspace necessitates four prerequisites: (1) the ability to
correctly attribute cyberattacks, (2) the ability to effectively
communicate US redlines, (3) the credibility of response if those red
lines are crossed, and (4) the capabilities to successfully
retaliate.103

To put Libicki's theory into practice, let us consider a few simple
deterrence scenarios between a fictional country A (the aggressor) and a
fictional country B (the defender). B's aim is to deter A's hostile
behavior in cyberspace.

First, deterrence in cyberspace succeeds if country A abstains from
initiating hostilities against country B. A's behavior could be due to a
strategic rationale to avoid conflict, the negative outcome of a
comprehensive cost-benefit analysis, B's ability to effectively
communicate redlines, or none of the above. Lacking any evidence that
might explain A's inaction, it is impossible to ascertain whether B's
deterrence posture worked as desired. As such, none or all of Libicki's
prerequisites would need to be fulfilled for this outcome to occur. This
scenario has unfolded over the years with several researchers asserting
that the absence of cyberattacks that cross the threshold to an armed
attack is evidence of constraint and the functioning of deterrence in
cyberspace.104 While, logically, the absence of evidence can be
considered evidence in itself, the absence of any theoretical
underpinnings that can explain the supposed causal deterrence mechanisms
at work creates a circular logic that delivers no answers at all.

Second, deterrence in cyberspace succeeds if country B responds
(proportionally or disproportionally) to an attack from country A
(within a proximate temporal range), and hostilities subsequently
terminate. Three of Libicki's prerequisites would need to be fulfilled
for this deterrence scenario to commence. The ability of effectively
communicating redlines is redundant after the fact. However, we have not
witnessed any exchange that would fit into this tit-for-tat category.
This absence might indicate that escalation dynamics work entirely
different in cyberspace---if at all---or might feed into a different
political threat perception and strategic calculus that currently does
not yet naturally translate down to the operational end and kicking off
an immediate offensive response in cyberspace. Time likely moves
magnitudes slower when it comes to decision-making processes for actions
and reactions in cyberspace. Thus, decisions in real space and dynamics
in cyberspace move independently from each other---in turn breaking down
any escalation ladder before it can manifest itself. This time lag or
causal disconnect would also explain why persistent engagement might not
elicit an escalatory response or probably will not become entangled in
an escalation ladder.105

Third, deterrence succeeds if country B responds out of domain to a
cyberattack from country A by leveraging existing deterrence frameworks
elsewhere (i.e., cross-domain deterrence), and subsequent adversarial
actions in cyberspace terminate. All four of Libicki's prerequisites
would need to be fulfilled for this scenario to occur. However, if, for
instance, country B responds with economic sanctions or criminal
indictments---which are not connected to traditional deterrence
dynamics---then country A might not be deterred by B's retaliatory
actions. The European Union and US Justice and Treasury Departments are
currently locked into the latter scenario. It is uncertain whether their
actions deter anyone or impose relevant costs on adversarial operations.

Fourth, cyber deterrence partially succeeds if country A attacks country
B, and B responds by attacking country C due to misattribution. If
country A deliberately left behind forensic evidence that would point
toward country C (i.e., a false flag operation), then B's cyber
deterrence posture inherently failed. However, if country B experienced
a massive intelligence failure on its end and struck country C purely by
mistake, then B's willingness to forcefully respond against country C
might deter A from future attacks. In this scenario, only three of
Libicki's prerequisites would need to be fulfilled. Given the complexity
of this scenario, we have not yet witnessed anything like it in
cyberspace.

Fifth, if hostilities between country A and B (1) can be curtailed to
episodic engagements, (2) are limited in their intensity, (3) remain
constrained to the cyber domain, and (4) do not pull in civilian targets
or allied forces, cyber deterrence could theoretically succeed in what
Herman Kahn describes as a state of limited conflict or "agreed
battle."106 However, if any of those tacitly agreed on limitations are
broken, deterrence fails, and escalation might reign supreme. For this
interaction to play out, the only prerequisite necessary is for A and B
to be able to correctly attribute each other's cyberattacks.

Scenario two combined with scenario five is where persistent engagement
currently falls within the deterrence conundrum. Persistent engagement
necessitates effectively communicating redlines (scenario two), but in
contrast to traditional deterrence thinking, it also actively seeks out
adversarial contact (scenario five).

When Is Cyber Deterrence Unsuccessful?

First, [deterrence]{.underline} **[fails]{.underline}** [if country A
conducts a "first strike" against country B without country B responding
in self-defense. This]{.underline} reaction [may be due to]{.underline}
simple **[self-restraint, entanglement, or paralysis by
analysis]{.underline}**. A war-gaming example for such behavior was
observed by Jacquelin Schneider, assistant professor in the Strategic
and Operational Research Department at the US Naval College, during the
DoD's annual war-game series Deterrence and Escalation Game in Review
(DEGRE) in 2011. According to Schneider, the red team conducted
offensive cyber operations against blue prior to any conventional
military exchange. [Instead of]{.underline} **[responding]{.underline}**
in kind, [the blue]{.underline} defense [lead explained, "I do not
feel]{.underline} **[any]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline}
cyber-[attacks raised to the level where]{.underline}
**[retaliation]{.underline}** [was needed and/or warranted! It was **not
risking nuclear war!"**]{.underline}107 Most of the other blue players
echoed the sentiment, with one commenting that ["cyber-attacks\[,\]
although **annoying**\[,\] do]{.underline} [**not appear
crippling**."]{.underline}108 [Yet when blue discussed employing
offensive cyber]{.underline} operations [**themselves**, they
immediately **self-restrained**]{.underline} [by creating "an
equivalency between cyber operations and nuclear attack,"]{.underline}
arguing that "any cyber attack would necessarily lead to a nuclear
response."109 [The example illustrates the]{.underline} **[meatspace
logics]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[assumptions]{.underline}**
[being made on the strategic level when it comes to deterrence by
punishment and cross-domain deterrence]{.underline}. [They]{.underline}
also **[fundamentally contradict the logics of war]{.underline}**
[entailing the maximization versus the moderation of force]{.underline}.
As Clausewitz wrote in On War, "to introduce the principle of moderation
into the theory of war itself would always lead to logical
absurdity."110

Second, cyber deterrence fails if country B preemptively attacks country
A. Such was the case in DEGRE's 2012 exercise. As Schneider noted, the
blue team went all in on preemptive cyber network operations to "degrade
the enemy's ability to conventionally respond to US operations."111
Schneider stated that "the perception by the blue team was that blue was
just as vulnerable . . . as the red team \[if not more so\] . . . and
therefore had to preemptively strike red's ability to conduct both cyber
and kinetic attacks against blue command and control."112 While this
example is close to the logics of persistent engagement, it is also much
more aggressive in nature. The caveat here is that while persistent
engagement aims to create friction within an adversary's cyber
capabilities and infrastructure, the blue team in DEGRE conducted
offensive cyber operations to degrade and affect the red team's
conventional war-fighting capabilities. That being said, country B might
succeed in establishing a cyber deterrence posture after hostilities
have ceased in this scenario.

Third, cyber deterrence fails when strategic signaling between both
countries collapses at the most basic level. This was the case in
DEGRE's 2013 wargame exercise. As Schneider explains, the blue team
started by implementing strict rules of engagement on computer network
exploitation to create a deterrence policy that would disincentivize red
from conducting preemptive cyberattacks. This approach led to the rather
absurd situation where blue worried about the detection of their cyber
espionage efforts (not attack) amid a naval blockade that saw the
exchange of gunfire and 20 of red's aircraft being shot down. Blue even
tried to refine its deterrence policy by using cyber operations as a
means of "signal\[ing\] potential capability while trying to avoid
inadvertently signaling aggression or the willingness to escalate."113
Schneider observes that "the red team failed to understand this elegant
distinction."114 In terms of responses, the blue team viewed red's
cyberattacks "as less escalatory than other kinetic options and
therefore believed it was not worth a response."115

And fourth, cyber deterrence fails if country A initiates hostilities,
country B responds proportionally, and country A repeatedly escalates,
potentially locking both into an escalation ladder. An example of such a
crisis escalation scenario was on display during the four-day Schriever
Wargame in 2010, hosted by Air Force Space Command and featuring some
600 military, civilian, and allied players.116 According to Maj Gen
Susan J. Helms, director of Plans and Policy at US Strategic Command,
hostilities commenced when "in a response to a perceived provocation, a
regional adversary disabled the cyber and space assets of a key US
ally."117 While debating how to deter attacks on US and allied space and
cyber capabilities, the blue team realized that the enemy continued to
attack time and time again and "was not deterred from further
escalation." General Helms added, "As we came to learn, the leaders of
this provocative regional state had defined their objectives (although
those objectives were not obvious to us) and had already thought through
the overall costs and benefits of their plan. In other words, they had
assessed our likely behavior in the context of the scenario at hand,
determined that, for them, the benefits of action outweighed the risks
and they made their decision to 'move out.' At that point, options for
deterrence by the US and her allies were 'late to need.' "118

Granted, these war-gaming examples are not ideal cases to adequately
reflect the decision-making dynamics playing out regarding cyberspace.
But they provide valuable insights into the **[flawed
logics]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[strategic
concerns]{.underline}** that **[hinder]{.underline}** [developing
sensible deterrence strategies and enabling operational tactics in the
cyber domain]{.underline}.

3.4 Conventional Deterrence Theory

[Concerned by the risks of escalation]{.underline}, international
[organisations such as **NATO**]{.underline}, the UN Institute for
Disarmament Research (UNIDIR), [and national governments, like
the]{.underline} UK and **[US]{.underline}** [have started to consider
**whether**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} **[how]{.underline}** [to,
deploy **deterrence**]{.underline} [to foster **stability of
cyberspace**]{.underline}.

**[However]{.underline}**, [deploying **cyber deterrence** strategies is
**challenging**]{.underline}. [For **conventional [deterrence]{.mark}
theory**]{.underline} ([hereafter: deterrence theory]{.underline})
**[[does not work in cyber]{.mark}space]{.underline}**, [as it does not
address the **global reach,**]{.underline} **[anonymity]{.underline}**,
[or]{.underline} the **[distributed]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[interconnected nature]{.underline}** [of this domain]{.underline}.
[Deterrence [theory has three core elements:]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[attribution]{.underline}**]{.mark} of attacks,
[**[defence]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[retaliation]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[as]{.mark} types of deterring
[strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[and]{.mark} the
**[capability]{.mark}** of the defender [to **signal credible
threats**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Fig. 3.1). **[[None]{.mark} of these
elements [is attainable]{.mark} in cyberspace[.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[Consider]{.underline} **[attribution]{.underline}** first.
[**[Prompt]{.underline}**, **[positive]{.underline}**
[attribution]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
**[crucial]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to deterrence: the **less
immediate**]{.underline} [is attribution, the **less severe** will be
the defender's response]{.underline}. [The **less
positive**]{.underline} [the attribution, the **more time** will be
necessary to respond. [In cyber]{.mark}space, [attribution is]{.mark}
**at best problematic**]{.underline}, [if not
**[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Cyber [attacks
are]{.mark}]{.underline} [often [launched in]{.mark} **different
[stages]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and involve]{.mark} **[global]{.mark}ly
distributed [networks]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of machines, as well as
pieces of code]{.underline} [that combine different elements provided
(or stolen) by a number of actors]{.underline}. In this scenario,
[identifying the **malware**]{.underline}, [the **network** of infected
machines, or **even the country**]{.underline} [of origin of the attack
is **not sufficient**]{.underline} [for]{.underline}
[attribution]{.underline}, [as [attackers can]{.mark} **design** and
**[route]{.mark}**]{.underline} their
[[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline} [[through **third-party
machines**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and countries with the goal
of]{.underline} **[obscuring]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[misdirecting]{.underline}** [attribution]{.underline}. The [limits of
attribution in cyberspace pose **serious obstacles**]{.underline} [to
the deployment of **effective deterrence**]{.underline}. Recalling Fig.
3.1, without attribution defence and retaliation, as well as signalling,
are left without a target and are undermined by the inability of the
defender to identify the attacker.

[[Signalling **credible threats**]{.underline}]{.mark} [is also
**problematic**]{.underline} [in cyberspace]{.underline}. [This element
[hinges on]{.mark} state's **[reputation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[In
**kinetic** scenarios, rep]{.mark}utation [is gained by
**showcasing**]{.mark} **military [capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[and by showing **ability to resolve**]{.underline} (to deter or defeat
the opponent) [over time.]{.underline} To some extent, the same also
holds true in cyberspace, where a state's reputation also refers to a
state's past interactions in this domain, its known cyber capabilities
to defend and offend, as well as its overall reputation in resolving
conflicts. However, [state's [rep]{.mark}utation [in cyber]{.mark}space
[**may not**]{.mark} necessarily **[correspond]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[actual [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[in this domain, [as states are **reluctant**]{.mark} [to **circulate
info**]{.mark}**rmation**]{.underline} [[about]{.mark} the
**[attacks]{.mark} that [they receive]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
[especially those that they **could not avert**]{.underline}. [This
makes signalling **less credible**]{.underline} and, thus, more
problematic than in other domains of warfare.

[Also [conventional]{.mark} deterrence [strategies, **defence** and
**retaliation**, are problematic]{.mark} in cyberspace]{.underline}.
[[**Every system** has]{.mark} its **security [vulnerabilities]{.mark}**
and identifying and exploiting them is simply a matter of **time**,
**means**, and **determination**.]{.underline} [This makes vulnerable
**even the most sophisticated defence mechanisms**]{.underline}, [thus
[limiting]{.mark} their [potential to deter]{.mark} new attacks **[by
defence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Unlike deterrence by defence,
[[deterrence by retaliation]{.mark} may be effective in cyberspace.
**However**]{.underline}, [this strategy [is coupled with **serious risk
of escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is because the **means to
retaliate**]{.underline}, [i.e. cyber weapons, are
**malleable**]{.underline} [and **difficult to control**]{.underline}.
[Cyber weapons can be **accessed**]{.underline},
**[stored]{.underline}**, **[combined]{.underline}**,
**[repurposed]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[redeployed]{.underline}** [much more easily than it was ever possible
with other kinds of military capability]{.underline}. [This was the
case, for example, of **Stuxnet**]{.underline}. Despite being designed
to target specific configuration requirements of Siemens software
installed on Iranian nuclear centrifuges, [the worm was eventually
released on the Internet and infected systems in Azerbaijan, Indonesia,
India, Pakistan, and the US]{.underline} (Farwell and Rohozinski 2011).

#### Deterrence fails for Cyber

[Let us check]{.underline} the **[reality]{.underline}** first. The
[[cyber deterrence]{.mark} strategies currently]{.underline} used [rely
on **defense** and **punishment**]{.underline}. [They
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[not]{.underline}**]{.mark} very
**[[effective]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as they fail to scare adversaries
away in cyber attacks.]{.underline} For example, Morgan (2017) estimates
that [global ransomware damage costs is up from \$324 million in 2015 to
**\$5 billion**]{.underline} [in 2017, \"a]{.underline} [**15X increase
in two years**, and]{.underline} [**expected to worsen**\".
Larson]{.underline} (2017) [lists the major cyber hacks of 2017 such as
Equifax data breach with the loss of the personal data of 145 million
people, leaked government tools, WannaCry that got spanned in more than
150 countries and took down many businesses, NotPetya virus that
targeted Ukrainian businesses with compromised tax software, Bad Rabbit
ransomware campaign that compromised news and media websites, almost 200
million voter records exposed, and hacks that targeted school
districts]{.underline}. In addition to some of the hacks mentioned
above, Mittal (2017) includes the following into the list: [Cloudbleed
security bug that leaked sensitive data of affected users such as
passwords and authentication tokens, and HBO hack with 1.5 terabytes of
information stolen including scripts and episodes of popular TV show
Game o f Thrones]{.underline}. [There are]{.underline} **[other
reasons]{.underline}** [for the unsuccessful]{.underline}
**[implementation]{.underline}** [of deterrence in the cyber domain.
They cover various aspects such as legal, psychological, strategic,
financial, and operational aspects. First]{.underline}, [[**legally**,
attribution is]{.underline} **[slow]{.underline}**]{.mark} [as it
[needs]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[time]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[in]{.underline} [**acquiring, examining, and [analyzing
ev]{.mark}**idence]{.underline} [in an investigative process. To make
things even more complicated, [attackers]{.mark} have developed various
ways of]{.underline} [**[hid]{.mark}**ing **[their
identity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by]{.mark} using]{.underline}
[**[botnets]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}]{.mark} **[hijacked
[hosts]{.mark}]{.underline}** [while launching attacks. The
**camouflage**]{.underline} further [slows down attribution.
Second,]{.underline} [**[psychologically]{.mark}**, people\'s responses
towards attacks in the]{.underline} **[[virtual]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[world are different from people\'s responses towards attacks in
the]{.underline} **[physical]{.underline}** [world. As
[damages]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[cannot be seen]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[with]{.underline} **[eyes]{.underline}** [in most cases, attacks in the
virtual world]{.underline} **[[seem]{.underline}]{.mark}** to be
**[[less severe]{.underline}]{.mark}** than those in the physical world
in many cases. [In other words,]{.underline} **[not seeing is less
believing]{.underline}**. Besides, Wells (2017) discusses disinformation
campaigns that \"aim to undermine citizen confidence and core beliefs\".
Such a campaign may not be recognized at the time when it is launched.
[It may take days, weeks, months, or even years to]{.underline}
**[recognize]{.underline}** [such a campaign. Should it be recognized,
it is still difficult to]{.underline} **[quantitatively
measure]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} true [damage]{.underline} that
it has caused. [This renders quick and well-cooperated countermeasures
impossible]{.underline}. [Third, **[strategically]{.mark}**, most [cyber
attacks are]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[deliberately]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[designed to be **[below the threshold of]{.mark} physical armed
attacks**. This makes it difficult for defenders to carry out
**[retal]{.mark}**iation traditionally used in the physical world. In
many cases, intruders walk away]{.underline} [**without being
punished**. This sets]{.underline} **[bad examples]{.underline}** for
other intruders. [Fourth,]{.underline} [**[financially]{.mark}**,
the]{.underline} [**cost of [retal]{.mark}**iation
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**not cheap**]{.mark}. Depending upon the
measures used in **varied domains**, the cost may go
**higher**]{.underline}. In addition, an economic sanction may affect
multiple parties in a global economic environment even the intruder side
gets the hard hit. [Fifth,]{.underline} [[**operationally**,
**collab**]{.mark}oration [requires]{.mark} a great amount of time and
efforts from all parties involved due to [diverse **interests and
capabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Should an economic measure or a
military operation be deemed necessary after a severe cyber attack from
an adversary, [a response must be well orchestrated from all the
relevant domains to guarantee its effectiveness. All [these]{.mark}
factors [make **deterrence hard to**]{.mark} be
**[implement]{.mark}**ed]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the
[cyber]{.underline} domain.

A Skeptics' Guide to **[Deterrence in Cyberspace]{.underline}**

The United States has recently become outspoken about using cyberspace
operations to impose costs on its adversaries. U.S. Cyber Command argues
that persistent engagement can have a cumulative effect on great power
rivals, which up to now have been able to operate freely without many
consequences. [More [assertive efforts]{.mark} [may]{.mark} disabuse
adversaries of the notion that they can act with impunity. A forward
defense may **[raise]{.mark}** the [**long-term cost** of
**cyber**]{.mark}**space [op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}** against the
United States]{.underline}, [reducing adversaries' belief that they
can]{.underline} **[erode U.S. power]{.underline}** [by working through
the digital domain]{.underline}. [[Stability may emerge **over
time**]{.underline} [as]{.underline}]{.mark} [rival [powers]{.mark}
[settle on **tacit norms**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[about]{.mark}
[what]{.mark} kinds of cyberspace [operations are
**tolerable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[None of this]{.underline}** [is relevant for **stopping Russian
mischief**]{.underline} [in the]{.underline} next [election,
however]{.underline}. [The goal is not **long-term stability,**
but]{.underline} **[immediate deterrence]{.underline}**. The United
States is facing a specific threat with a clear deadline. If U.S.
officials are right that Russia is ramping up its effort in advance of
the election, then they will likely conclude that economic sanctions and
military posturing are not enough. Observers may turn to more aggressive
cyberspace operations in the hopes that reciprocal attacks on Russian
networks may force it to reconsider its approach. Imagine a barrage of
debilitating cyber operations, employing sophisticated tools to inject
friction into Russian government agencies. Imagine Russian officials
worrying about the kind of ransomware attacks that hit Baltimore and
Atlanta. Now imagine U.S. officials making specific warnings along these
lines. Would they work?

Probably not. For a host of reasons, such [[threats are **unlikely to
deter Moscow**]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[Economic threats]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[military posturing]{.underline}** [have had
**little effect so far**]{.underline}, [and the addition of cyberspace
operations to the mix **adds little** in terms of coercive
**leverage**]{.underline}. While there has been enduring interest in the
notion of [cyber deterrence]{.underline}, a growing body of research
finds that the concept [has]{.underline} **[limited
value]{.underline}**. [It [may be possible to deter]{.mark}
**[particularly destructive attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} requiring
extensive organizational resources -- [think here of something like an
attack designed to **cripple a civilian power grid.**]{.underline} And
recent work on cross-domain deterrence explores the possibility of using
non-cyber tools to inspire caution among states considering offensive
cyberspace operations. [[But]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [most]{.mark} other
[cases]{.mark}, [deterrence is **dubious**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This
is [especially true when]{.mark} the [actions]{.mark} we seek to deter
**[are not destructive]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The basic problem is that [cyberspace is a **lousy domain for
coercion.**]{.underline} [Individuals, firms, and [states are]{.mark}
relatively tolerant of cyber operations, and **[willing to engage
online]{.mark}**]{.underline} even in the wake of high-profile
cybersecurity breakdowns. **[Retaliatory threats lack
teeth]{.underline}** [because key actors in cyberspace are not
**remarkably fearful**]{.underline} [or]{.underline}
**[vengeful]{.underline}**. Experimental studies find that [the public
is]{.underline} also cau[tious about escalation]{.underline} in the wake
of hypothetical cyberattacks. [This]{.underline} tendency not only
creates an escalation firebreak but also **[undermines]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} **[credibility of deterrent signals]{.underline}**,
[which require a **willingness to accept risk**.]{.underline}

Other domestic factors work against deterrence. [Sending clear signals
in cyberspace is tricky]{.underline}, for example, [because states do
not **control** the **infrastructure** of the domain]{.underline}.
**[Public-private coordination]{.underline}** [is **necessary** both to
**make threats** and **execute them**,]{.underline} but such
coordination is difficult and sometimes contentious.

**[International]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[technological
factors]{.underline}** [also make deterrence difficult]{.underline}. As
Erik Gartzke and Jon Lindsay point out, [**coercion** in
[cyber]{.mark}space [is]{.mark} difficult because the domain is [built
on **voluntary connections**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This
**[reduces]{.mark}** the **[credibility of
threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to conduct **truly damaging
attacks**]{.underline}, [because such threats give the target a reason
to **disconnect**]{.underline}. Other research has reinforced the
conclusion that cyberspace operations have limited coercive value, both
in peacetime and war. The theoretical requirements of effective coercion
do not map easily onto cyber operations, and empirical studies suggest
that they are only useful when they support other policy instruments.

All this suggests that cyberspace coercion is difficult even against
vulnerable states that are particularly sensitive to foreign pressure.
Putin's [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is not one of those states. [It
[has been willing to **absorb** **substantial
costs**]{.underline}]{.mark} [rather than **back down** from its
strategic choices]{.underline}, however dubious. [And the [cost-benefit
equation **continues to favor Russian activism**]{.mark}: the ability to
**affect the United States** through]{.underline} [**[election
meddling]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark} [probably
**[irresistible]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for a country that faces
**overwhelming** **military**, **economic**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} **[diplomatic]{.underline}**
[disadvantages]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[Meddling is
cheap]{.underline}**. As Sen. Mark Warner puts it, "[if you add up all
Russia spent in the Brexit vote, the French presidential elections, and
the 2016 American elections, it's less than the cost of one new F-35
airplane]{.underline}."

Challenges to a smooth integration of cyber effects

Assessing effects---ensuring proportionality and discrimination

[How **likely** is it that the requested cyber effect will be delivered?
The answer]{.underline} to this question [is]{.underline} [**not
clear**, in respect of either]{.underline} its
**[preparation]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} its
**[execution]{.underline}**. This is [not only because IT
vulnerabilities are constantly]{.underline} **[discovered and

**assessing**]{.underline} the **[effects]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} possible **[side-effects]{.underline}** [of an exploit
when navigating and analysing complex IT infrastructures. In other
words,]{.underline} **[reconnaissance is difficult]{.underline}** in
cyberspace, [and so is]{.underline} the **[containment]{.underline}**
[of effects. The Russian attempt to use ransomware aimed at disrupting
critical **Ukrainian**]{.underline} [infrastructure in]{.underline}
**[2017]{.underline}**, for example, [**succeeded**---but]{.underline}
**[simultaneously]{.underline}** [encrypted **computers globally**,
causing]{.underline} **[substantial economic damage]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} multinational [businesses such as]{.underline}
**[Maersk and FedEx]{.underline}**.34

**[Collateral damage and unintended consequences]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} [**serious issues for NATO**. The alliance takes pride
in its adherence to the principles laid out in]{.underline}
**[i]{.underline}**nternational [**law**, such as proportionality and
discrimination]{.underline}, as former NATO Deputy Assistant
Secretary-General Jamie Shea has emphasized.35 [Thus, disruptions of
servers with huge negative implications for]{.underline} [**civilians**,
or the use of]{.underline} **[generic]{.underline}** [cyber tools that
risk spreading their effects far and wide, are most likely]{.underline}
**[not going to be considered for use in NATO operations]{.underline}**.
Indeed, [one of the main challenges to US efforts to disrupt servers in
working against]{.underline} **[ISIS]{.underline}** [was finding ways to
ensure]{.underline} that **[civilians]{.underline}** [were]{.underline}
**[not hit by]{.underline}** their **[cyber effects]{.underline}**.36

[Another aspect]{.underline} of the difficulty of assessing the cyber
effect [relates to adversaries']{.underline} **[cyber
defence]{.underline}** [efforts. For the more sophisticated
players]{.underline} in cyberspace, [cyber defence has developed into
**more** than simply **patching**]{.underline},
**[clearing]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[updating]{.underline}**
systems. Cyber [defence is also increasingly about **following** an
intruder's activity in one's own network and creating '**honeypots'** or
'**honeynets'**; or about **following** data traffic **back** to the
intruder's network. In short, cyber defence is also about **deception**
and **active defence**]{.underline}.37 [This approach to cyber defence
offers valuable insights into the intruder's techniques and strategies;
but the mere knowledge that deception is becoming a predominant
defensive strategy also introduces **doubts** into the **intruder's
assessment of possible effects**.]{.underline}

Consequently, as Russia is considered a peer competitor with
considerable cyber-defensive capacities, one informant expressed
scepticism about the extent to which smaller member states are confident
in their ability to deliver a cyber effect when it is requested by
NATO.38 This is especially the case if operational success depends on a
specific effect. Even if a state has developed the appropriate exploit,
it must also be able to verify that the effect is achieved and ensure
that the effect is contained to minimize collateral damage. And even if
a state is confident about its current ability to contain and verify an
effect, it must also be confident that it can deliver, verify and
contain the effect at the specific time in the future when CYOC requests
it.

[The process of integration is further **complicated**]{.underline} [by
the fact that NATO must be willing to **hand over to contributing
states**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[responsibility for making
battle damage assessments and collateral damage
estimations]{.underline}**. As the following subsection shows, [states
are generally **unwilling to share classified information**]{.underline}
[about exploits. Hence, the delegated NATO commander is **unlikely to
receive much useful information**]{.underline} about how cyber effects
are delivered [before a decision about their deployment must be taken.
As commanders would prefer to have control over the capabilities used,
member-state cyber effects are likely choices of method **only** if
**alternative, conventional effects are unavailable**]{.underline}.

[The challenges]{.underline} associated with assessing cyber effects
[are]{.underline} naturally **[most significant]{.underline}** [in
relation to those effects that **enable other kinetic
effects**]{.underline} that are necessary to achieve operational
success. For cyber effects that seek to maintain a persistent annoyance
of Russian networks, these challenges are less of an issue. If the aim
is to create confusion and drain resources by targeting networks and
operations that are otherwise difficult and expensive to disrupt using
conventional means, then cyber effects can support strategic goals
without causing irreversible damage to civilians. As I will conclude at
the end of this section, such a change demands an adaptation of the way
in which CYOC operates.

#### Members will say no to deconfliction efforts\-\--secrecy is a red line. 

Jeppe T. **Jacobsen 21**, Ph.D. candidate at the Danish Institute for
International Studies and the Center for War Studies at the University
of Southern Denmark, worked as cyber coordinator at the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of Denmark where he coordinated Denmark's cyber
diplomacy, "Cyber Offense in NATO: Challenges and Opportunities,"
International Affairs, vol. 97, no. 3, 05/01/2021, pp. 703--720

The third challenge to the integration of cyber effects in NATO
operations relates to a well-known military concept, deconfliction. The
**[coordination]{.underline}** [by allies and military units of their
efforts to avoid confliction]{.underline}, between for example an air
operation and a special forces operation in the same area, [is a
**central element in every military campaign**]{.underline}.
[Deconfliction is all about **openness** and
**communication**]{.underline} between allied partners. [But in
**cyberspace**]{.underline}, [deconfliction comes with]{.underline}
several **[difficulties]{.underline}**. [At the **core**]{.underline} of
these difficulties [is the fact that the tools and techniques that
produce cyber effects---which are often also used and heavily depended
on for **intelligence collection**---are **developed in
secret**]{.underline} [and must **stay secret**]{.underline} [until the
effect is **achieved**]{.underline}. [If the]{.underline} IT
[vulnerabilities]{.underline} and exploits [are **known**]{.underline},
[vendors or adversaries can **fix or replace the software**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} thereby [render the effect **impossible**]{.underline}
to achieve.39 [In an alliance **not known for sufficient mutual
trust**]{.underline} among members to share intelligence,40 [there is
**little indication**]{.underline} [that allies will become **more open
about the cyber tools and techniques they currently have at their
disposal**]{.underline}. [The **request-based** model is the **result**
of that lack of trust.]{.underline} And the [unwillingness to share
cyber intelligence seriously **challenges NATO's ambition**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} use CYOC to [facilitate information-sharing to increase
situational awareness and thereby achieve the 'cyber readiness' and
'cyber resiliency' that NATO Deputy Secretary-General]{.underline}
Mircea Geoană [hopes to attain]{.underline}.41

Furthermore, [lack of coordination and discussion about the use of
military cyber capabilities, both internally in each state and among
allies, can have **negative implications for intelligence**]{.underline}
activities and general network security. [A conventional **military
decision**]{.underline} [to deliver cyber effects is]{.underline}
**[rarely concerned]{.underline}** [with **maintaining
access**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[staying secret]{.underline}**
**[after]{.underline}** [an effect]{.underline} is achieved. Even
[though it is]{.underline} **[customary]{.underline}** [to try to
obscure the vulnerabilities that are being exploited, it is **difficult
to ensure**]{.underline} that those operating the targeted system or
third-party [network analysts do **not identify**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[fix]{.underline}** the
**[vulnerabilities]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}, for example,
**[commercial]{.underline}** [products]{.underline} used all over the
world. Thus, [military plans to engage other state entities need to
weigh the **benefit** of]{.underline} **[delivering]{.underline}**
[cyber effects against the risk of]{.underline} **[losing
intelligence]{.underline}** capacity, [as well as the risk
that]{.underline} **[other actors]{.underline}** (allies, corporations,
adversaries, criminals, etc.) [will use the]{.underline} **[same
exploits]{.underline}** [against]{.underline} **[oneself]{.underline}**.
In other words, [there is a **conflict of interest**]{.underline}
[between]{.underline} **[attack]{.underline}**,
**[intel]{.underline}**ligence collection [and]{.underline} **[internal
defence]{.underline}** in each NATO member state.42 [The desire
of]{.underline} the US **[Cyber Com]{.underline}**mand [to become
more]{.underline} **[independent]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} the
National Security Agency (**[NSA]{.underline}**) [is]{.underline}
precisely [an attempt to gain a]{.underline} **[stronger
voice]{.underline}** [when the US government assesses whether a
vulnerability should be **disclosed**]{.underline} to vendors,
**[retained]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[intel]{.underline}**ligence purposes [or]{.underline}
**[used]{.underline}** [to deliver]{.underline} **['loud']{.underline}**
cyber **[effects]{.underline}**.43

[The risk of]{.underline} **[confliction]{.underline}** [among allies
arises from the fact that a **similar assessment
procedure**]{.underline} [does **not exist across NATO**]{.underline}.
As conversations with several national representatives at the CDC
reveal, such a procedure is unlikely to be agreed upon owing to the
different perspectives on offence, defence and espionage in cyberspace
currently prevailing among member states.44 [If the]{.underline}
**[Netherlands]{.underline}**, for example, [offers to deliver
a]{.underline} **['loud' cyber effect]{.underline}** in a NATO
operation, [British or American]{.underline}
**[intel]{.underline}**ligence [operations could end up
being]{.underline} **[disturbed]{.underline}** [because they rely on
the]{.underline} **[same vulnerabilities]{.underline}** which---when
used in military operations---risk being exposed and subsequently
fixed.45 When deploying 'loud' cyber effects, malicious actors such as
criminals are also given the opportunity to identify and exploit the
same vulnerabilities in unpatched systems in allied countries. The
ransomware incidents known as WannaCry and NotPetya are examples of the
damage that can emerge from government exploits becoming publicly
available---even though the specific vulnerabilities were already
patched by Microsoft and updates released to supported systems.46

In short, [there is a **dilemma**]{.underline} both internally, between
intelligence agencies and the military, and externally, between allies.
While it is difficult to do much about the latter, the internal power
dynamics in most states, with the intelligence agencies as the primary
cyber actors, are likely to limit the willingness of most states to
deliver military cyber effects---whether offensive or defensive---when
CYOC makes requests. They also limit the willingness to share cyber
threat information across the alliance through CYOC.

This section has pointed to three characteristics about cyberspace that
limit the integration of cyber effects in NATO operations. [In
a]{.underline} **[complex]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**constantly
changing cyberspace**, it continues to be difficult to develop and
maintain sophisticated exploits for targeted cyber effects. This is
especially the case if the cyber effects are requested for a
specific]{.underline} **[time and place]{.underline}** in order to
guarantee operational success, and if they simultaneously have to be
verifiable and conform to international legal principles. Neither the
member states, which face an internal dilemma between attack,
intelligence collection and defence in cyberspace, nor the NATO
commander, who will prefer to control the capabilities used, are likely
to feel sufficiently confident about the targeted or highly integrated
cyber effects to choose that option if other capabilities are available.

While these challenges are likely to persist, the cyber effects that
constantly cause temporary annoyances hold a largely unappreciated
potential in military operations. Even though each of these effects is
unlikely to have a measurable strategic effect on its own, they stay
true to the dynamic cyber environment while being able to drain
resources and cause confusion and doubt. To embrace this potential
fully, CYOC needs to adopt a more flexible and open-ended approach when
requesting cyber effects. A focus on highly targeted effects requested
at a specific time needs to be supplemented by more attention to
requests that give member states the freedom to contribute with a
variety of (offensive and actively defensive) effects when they become
available. This means, for example, a willingness from NATO to accept
member states' reluctance to share cyber intelligence and to give up
exclusive control over deciding on potential targets. To make SCEPVA
work, there must be a constant line of communication between the
national cyber units, CYOC and the NATO commanders to ensure rapid
decision-making on whether to use cyber effects when they become
available.

If NATO displays this willingness and maintains this line of
communication, the **[integration]{.underline}** [of cyber
effects]{.underline} will become as effective as possible for an
organization without close intelligence cooperation. CYOC,
however,---[even in its more **flexible
versions**]{.underline}---[is]{.underline} **[not likely to fulfil
NATO's stated ambition to strengthen its broader deterrence by
integrating offensive cyber effects in its operations]{.underline}**.47
The next section explains why.

NATOs cyber-resilience experienced in crisis management and
communication

[Societal [security]{.mark}]{.underline}, an emerging phenomenon in the
field of strategy and security, [[requires **good**]{.mark} crisis
management skills but also [**communication**]{.mark} effectiveness in
both the real and virtual worlds. **Business continuity** at NATO
requires]{.underline} as foresaid the Alliance, to be resilient and
surely for the purposes of this research paper, the Alliance and [allies
to be]{.underline} or become [cyber-resilient.]{.underline}

[By methodological approach, societal vulnerability continues and will
always continue to exist, so far and as long as threats are
there]{.underline}. Considering the current civil need to be always
preparing for a new "cold era," among others, considering the unlawful
annexation by Russia of Crimea in 2014 (BBC, 2014) and following the
disintegrating relations of NATO due to the unlawful act of Russia to
Ukraine, the establishment of the USA and then taken over by NATO, of
the Missile installation in Romania (Reuters, 2016) and the immediate
reaction and accusation of Russia in regard to these developments (New
York Times, 2016), the refugee challenges as an outcome on the constant
fight against ISIS (US Homeland Security Committee, 2015), but also the
phenomenal changes in the financial world (i.e., The Panama Papers (The
International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICJ), 2016)),
[NATO is required to become truly resilient NATO, as should also nations
and leaders.]{.underline}

[All aforementioned elements are crisis management factors. NATO
provides the **tools** and **method**ologie**s**, in which the Alliance
is requested to reply strategically and operationally. To mitigating
plans for pre-crisis, during crisis and after crises situations. For and
during operations, logistics of deployment or information gathering and
or training purposes, among others.]{.underline}

In such similar cases, [the [**legal** and **political
perspectives**]{.mark} also [on **cyber**]{.mark} operations [should be
**clear**]{.mark}. The **[success]{.mark}** of an operation [lays to
**effective logistical** and **operational support**]{.mark}. Therefore,
[the legal aspects that come with **sharing**]{.mark} of
**[info]{.mark}**rmation, on [how to **deploy forces**, identify **key
threats**]{.mark} and elements in cyber-space, [are
**important**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Internet has no borders. And
threats can easily infiltrate the national e-space and boundaries.
[Leaders are welcomed upon to take strong strategic-led
decisions.]{.underline}

[NATO is to ensure protection of all infrastructure. The Allies should
be able to **anticipate**, **identify**, **mitigate**, and **recover**
from "hybrid attacks]{.underline} (NATO Review, 2016)"---[the
dimension(s) of simultaneous attacks, while reducing the threat of
destabilization and or spreading fear.]{.underline}

[In a civic society, it is our **responsibility** to ensure adequate
**awareness** on cyber-defense and security. [To **learn** about the
**necessity**]{.mark} [to protect]{.mark} all [infrastructures]{.mark},
**[NATO's collective defense should be characterized by]{.mark}**
**[burden sharing]{.mark}**, **[openness]{.mark}**, flexibility, [and
**transparency** in coop]{.mark}eration and **[info]{.mark}**rmation
[**flow** among **member**]{.mark} state**[s]{.mark}**. [Through
**preparedness**]{.mark}, strategic and operational awareness,
**[strategic resilience can be achieved]{.mark}**. Response time and
framework will then allow NATO to counter threats as they
emerge.]{.underline}

[What to do? Develop norms as to the "red lines"]{.underline}

[I]{.underline}t [is vitally important]{.underline}, however, [to
appreciate that simply [because]{.mark} [a]{.mark} particular [cyber act
may]{.mark} **[legally constitute]{.mark}** [an "armed
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} [that might]{.underline}
**[qualify]{.underline}** [for the political characterization of an "act
of war," [that doesn't mean]{.mark} [that a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[country is **obliged to respond**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to it [with
force]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [there are many political reasons
that would counsel against doing so]{.underline}. This is where Mr.
Painter goes wrong with his discussion about "strategic ambiguity."

[[In deterrence, **ambiguity** may be **useful** with respect to a
**response**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but]{.mark} it is **markedly [less
so]{.mark}** []{.mark}when you are talking [about the
**threshold**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[Misunderstandings]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[as to]{.mark} where the
proverbial "**[red lines]{.mark}**]{.underline}["]{.mark} [are set [can
lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[dangerous
[miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}**, **[unintended
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[unwanted [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Given the **enormous
potential** of cyber acts to do harm, potential [actors ought not to get
**mixed messages** as to how the U.S. considers **harmful cyber
activities.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Frustrations with the **opaqueness**]{.underline} [as what cyber
activity would constitute a casus belli appears to have motivated
Congressman Mike Rounds to propose a bill earlier this year that would
require the President to develop a policy for determining "when an
action carried out in cyberspace constitutes an act of war against the
U.S."]{.underline}

Rounds points to testimony of Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, director
of the Defense Intelligence Agency, as part of his rational for the
legislation. Stewart admitted that a "much fuller definition of the
range of things that occur in cyber space \[is needed\], and then \[we
should\] start thinking about the threshold where an attack is
catastrophic enough or destructive enough that we define it as an act of
war, I think that would be extremely helpful."

Stewart isn't alone in not "fully" understanding where the threshold
lies. [Other **Pentagon leaders** apparently are equally
**uncertain**]{.underline}, [something that raises the obvious question:
**if our leaders don't know**]{.underline}, [how can we expect
**potential adversaries** to understand which acts might **spark a
full-blown war?**]{.underline} At the same time, except in the most
aggravated cases, [enumerating **in advance** precisely]{.underline}
[which cyber acts exceed the use of force threshold might be nearly
impossible.]{.underline}

[[This is where **norm development**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in
international law [comes into play]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In
doing so, the U.S. needs to use the language of international law.
Political terms like "digital acts of war" are unhelpful not only
because they do not track with the language of the law, they also can
imply to the general public a level of response that is unnecessarily
provocative and even inconsistent with the proportionality and necessity
factors intrinsic to a lawful exercise of self-defense, especially in
the complex cyber arena.

#### Innovation is [stalling]{.underline}. 

Christopher **Cole 21**, partner at Crowell Moring, "Lawmakers Worry
Rampant Mergers Crushing US Innovation," Law360, lexis.

[**[Innovation]{.underline}** [across the]{.underline}]{.mark} [U.S.
[economy]{.mark} has [suffered as **antitrust laws fall short**]{.mark}
in **stopping** predatory]{.underline} **[merger deals]{.underline}**
[and enforcers allow **massive industry consolidation**]{.underline} to
continue **[unabated]{.underline}**, **[[experts
said]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[Wednesday]{.underline}** on Capitol Hill.

[[In the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[latest congressional
hearing]{.underline}]{.mark}** [focused on **possible overhauls** of
**American competition laws**]{.underline} [to deal with **industry
concentration** in sectors ranging from **technology** to
**pharmaceuticals**, **real estate** and **agriculture**,]{.underline} a
Senate panel zeroed in on the impact of monopolies on the development of
cutting-edge products and services.

[Antitrust]{.underline} **[advocates]{.underline}** [and **business
[figures]{.mark}** [**testified**]{.mark}]{.underline} [that
[the]{.mark} U.S. [economy faces a **growing threat**
from]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[large companies\']{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[m]{.underline}**erger [and]{.underline} **[a]{.underline}**cquisition
[[strategies]{.mark} [that]{.mark} aim to **[knock out
startups]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} growing
**[rivals]{.underline}**, [then [**take advantage** of **market
power**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} continue **profiting off old
technologies**. The trend **[stifle]{.mark}s U.S. [innovation]{.mark}**
and **harms consumers**,]{.underline} they said.

Senators looked to the experts to inform the lawmakers\' biggest push in
years to revamp antitrust laws, including a major bipartisan bill
introduced in October, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act.
The bill would make it harder for online sales platforms to
self-preference their own products. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and
Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, are lead sponsors of the bill, one of numerous
antitrust proposals circulating on Capitol Hill.

\"It\'s always been innovation that has fueled the American economy,\"
said Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate Judiciary antitrust panel, but
that \"cannot thrive without open and competitive markets.\"

[[Monopoly power]{.underline}]{.mark} is on the increase in industries
\"from cat food to caskets,\" Klobuchar said, and that
**[[stifles]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the [ability of **new
companies**]{.mark} that may develop **better products**]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} **[services]{.underline}** [[to **gain
funding**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[enter the
market]{.mark} competitively]{.underline}**. \"We also have to remember
that **[[innovation is all about competition]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\"
she said.

Utah Sen. Mike Lee, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, also
voiced concern about consolidation suffocating the economy. Lee said
that \"I\'m a huge advocate of the consumer welfare standard\" that
federal courts use to assess whether market behavior is unlawfully
anticompetitive but \"when competition suffers, so does innovation.\"

\"One might say that competition is itself the mother of innovation,\"
said Lee, who has been working closely with Klobuchar and Grassley, the
full committee\'s ranking Republican, on antitrust legislation this
year.

Still, Lee said lawmakers and enforcers must take care not to carry out
\"regulatory overreach\" that ends up protecting no one except market
incumbents when they make it harder for startups to succeed. Lee touted
Utah\'s \"pro-free market\" approach that he said has been a magnet for
new businesses and driven the quality of life higher in the Beehive
State. \"I do worry, however, that D.C. bureaucrats may spoil the party
for everyone,\" he said.

Conservatives also voiced concern that consolidation of power in Big
Tech has allowed the top companies to rein in free speech, and Lee
pointed to the controversy over the startup social media platform
Parler, which almost sunk amid the turmoil over the 2020 election.

The vast technology sector was only one aspect of Wednesday\'s hearing,
however, as several witnesses talked about growing monopolies in pharma,
real estate and other parts of the economy where they said behemoths\'
market power was holding back innovation.

Diana Moss, president of American Antitrust Institute, told senators
there are many reasons that innovation is currently struggling in the
U.S. economy. She said the financial markets\' \"laser focus on
shareholder returns\" based on the bottom line and short-term profits
was making it more difficult for companies to invest in much-needed
research and development.

\"Another reason is weaker antitrust enforcement over the last 40
years,\" Moss said.

Alex Harman, competition policy advocate at Public Citizen, the
liberal-leaning advocacy group, called unfettered merger and acquisition
activity and the massive buildup of a small number of companies \"one of
the most critical issues of our time.\" Harman said [[there had been an
\"**alarming increase** in]{.mark} **[consolidation]{.mark}** throughout
the economy.\"]{.underline}

Another witness, Roger [Alford, a professor at Notre Dame Law School,
identified]{.underline} **[multiple competitive problems]{.underline}**

### Innovation DA\-\--AT: China Impact

#### AFF solves Chinese hybrid threat by [contingency planning]{.underline}\-\--that's key to security

Lauren **Speranza 20**, director for trans-Atlantic defense and security
at the Center for European Policy Analysis, 7/8/20, "China Is NATO's New
Problem,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/08/china-nato-hybrid-threats-europe-cyber/

[Over the past decade]{.underline}, [Chinese companies]{.underline} have
[invested billions]{.underline} of dollars [throughout
Europe]{.underline}---[buying up **critical
infrastructure**]{.underline} [and increasing Beijing's **political
clout**]{.underline} [across the continent]{.underline}. As Chinese
firms, often with strong ties to the state and Chinese Communist Party
(CCP), acquire parts of sensitive ports, pipelines, and
telecommunication networks, [China's incursions into Europe's security
umbrella are drawing serious concern.]{.underline}

[But **NATO**]{.underline}, long worried about Russia, [has largely been
silent on China]{.underline}. **[Now]{.underline}**, [that is
changing]{.underline}. [NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg recently
called on the alliance to stand up to Beijing's "bullying and coercion,"
underscoring how China's rise is fundamentally shifting the global
balance of power]{.underline}. **[It's apparent]{.underline}** that
[[NATO]{.mark} can **no longer ignore the threat**]{.underline}. [If the
alliance hopes to **remain competitive**]{.underline}, [it [will
need]{.mark}]{.underline} to develop [a **new strategy** for dealing
with Beijing]{.underline}.

First, [NATO needs a **common [assessment of China's hybrid
threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[a mix of diplomatic, economic,
security, information, and technological actions designed to quietly
**undermine democratic states and institutions**]{.underline} [to
Beijing's benefit while avoiding a traditional conflict]{.underline}.
While [China's]{.underline} conventional military threat in the
Indo-Pacific is far from NATO's borders, its [hybrid activities are
happening in the alliance's own backyard]{.underline}.

**[[Cyber-espionage]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntellectual
**[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**roperty **[[theft]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[infiltration of critical infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[debt manipulation]{.underline}**, [[and
**disinfor**]{.mark}**mation**]{.underline} [are prime
examples]{.underline}. [While these threats may **seem** to fall outside
of NATO's purview]{.underline}, [they [pose]{.mark} serious security
[risks]{.mark} for the alliance]{.underline}. For instance,
[China's]{.underline} desire to invest in Lithuania's Klaipeda Port may
not look like a problem for NATO on its surface. But its investments
have worrying strings attached that give China [operating control
over]{.underline} the [infrastructure]{.underline}. That control [could
decrease **allies' willingness to move military
forces**]{.underline}---**[including sensitive
technologies]{.underline}**---through the port and its surrounding
networks. [This could]{.underline} lead to [disrupt]{.underline}ed
[planning and]{.underline} fewer [military exercises]{.underline},
[decreasing NATO's ability to defend the Baltic States during a crisis
with Russia]{.underline}. [This could also open the door for **pragmatic
collaboration between China and Russia** to undermine trans-Atlantic
security.]{.underline}

[Allies need to forge a **shared understanding** of these risks through
**information-sharing and dialogue**]{.underline}---[no small feat for
countries that do not see eye to eye on China. Some are even willing to
ignore such vulnerabilities, due to economic benefits or disenchantment
with trans-Atlantic institutions]{.underline}. [[The
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has]{.mark} a **critical role** [to]{.mark} play in [get]{.mark}ting
[allies **on the same page**]{.mark} and **setting common goals** for
countering China's hybrid activities]{.underline}.

Second, NATO needs to focus on public diplomacy. **[NATO]{.underline}**
[has an important role to play in the battle against the CCP's global
narratives, which Beijing promulgates through **hybrid
activities**]{.underline}. [[To defend]{.underline}]{.mark} the
trans-Atlantic values on which the alliance is built---freedom,
**[[democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[rule of
law]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and **human
rights**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[NATO should clearly communicate China's
violations]{.underline} of these principles and its propaganda efforts
to cover them up. (These include, among others, human rights abuses
against ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang and violations of the U.N. Convention
on the Law of the Sea in the South China Sea.) NATO should also enhance
its outreach to key partners in the Indo-Pacific, such as Australia,
Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea, which can serve as important
counterweights to Chinese influence in the region. Effective public
messaging also means getting serious about attributing the blame for
attacks, as the European Commission recently did over Chinese
disinformation around COVID-19, to raise the pressure on Chinese
officials. [Trans-Atlantic countries have **struggled to shape China's
behavior** because they cannot prove malign intent or agree to call out
Beijing for its subversive efforts. [Allies should develop **clearer
guidelines**]{.mark}---**what needs to be proved**, **by whom**, **and
to what degree**---[to enable **collective attribution**]{.mark}. NATO
is strongest when it speaks with one voice. It should use that voice to
demand transparency and change from China.]{.underline}

Third, the alliance should step up its counteroffensive. [China's
[hybrid actions]{.mark} intentionally [**blur the lines**]{.mark}
between what is **legally permissible**]{.underline}, **[politically
inappropriate]{.underline}**, [and **downright
escalatory**]{.underline}.

[This [makes it difficult]{.mark} for leaders [to determine
**appropriate responses**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [producing a
reactionary approach]{.underline} **[thus far]{.underline}**. [But an
intensifying geostrategic competition has already begun. To compete in
this environment, the trans-Atlantic community needs [a **more proactive
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather than waiting for China to invest
in the next major European port, allies should coordinate legislation to
prevent the riskiest Chinese acquisitions. And rather than waiting for
more Chinese cyberintrusions, allies should collaborate on responsible,
targeted offensive cyberactions. Over time, this
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} help [**[dissuade China]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline}]{.mark} [manipulating investments in critical
infrastructure, [conducting]{.mark} cyber-espionage, and other [hybrid
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}. While adopting [a more offensive
posture]{.underline} remains controversial among certain allies, it [is
**gaining traction across Europe**]{.underline} and is **[strongly
supported in Washington]{.underline}**. [Although NATO]{.underline},
**[as a defensive alliance]{.underline}**, [should not
implement]{.underline} such [a counteroffensive]{.underline},
[policymakers should **leverage it** as the **primary forum** to
**coordinate actions among willing nations**]{.underline}.

Fourth, NATO needs to deepen its cooperation with other key players,
such as the European Union and the private sector. Where NATO lacks the
mandate and means, the EU and multinational businesses play critical
roles in developing, implementing, and enforcing the legislation and
financial incentives necessary to counter Chinese hybrid threats.
Complementary to that, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and its allies [[can
focus on]{.mark} providing intelligence, defending cyberspace,
developing capability targets for new technologies, conducting exercises
and **[contingency planning]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [informing
resilience requirements for secure infrastructure, and bolstering
deterrence]{.underline}. Despite the political obstacles that impede
more formal NATO-EU cooperation, allies should look to the European
Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki to bring
together NATO and EU staff, national officials, and industry voices in
one place to align their counter-hybrid policies for China.

[The Chinese government's manipulative efforts around the coronavirus
have thrust China's hybrid activities to the center of trans-Atlantic
debates. Policymakers need to **seize the moment** and respond by
**"using NATO more politically,"**]{.underline} in Stoltenberg's words.
NATO is first and foremost about its nations. [In the fight against
China's hybrid threats, these nations bring much more to the table than
military power alone. They have access to a broad range of
tools---military, political, economic, technological, and
information---which the alliance can use to its collective geopolitical
advantage in the competition with China. What NATO needs now is a
strategy to leverage those tools in a **coordinated manner**. That will
go a long way in solving NATO's China problem.]{.underline}

[[China's]{.mark} territorial ambitions as a 'hybrid
threat'?]{.underline}

[China has participated in **more territorial disputes**]{.underline}
[than]{.underline} **[any other state]{.underline}** since the end of
the Second World War.40 [Many of these disputes could be considered
**expansionism**]{.underline}, with the exception of Taiwan, which has
remained a reunification objective of the People's Republic of China
(PRC) since 1949. [The [disputes include]{.mark} **land border claims**
and counter-claims, such as with]{.underline} **[India]{.underline}**,
[and arguments with **Hong Kong**]{.underline} [over its **separate
legal system**]{.underline} [are also increasingly a **source of
tension**.]{.underline} However, the [primary focus]{.underline} of
Chinese expansionism [tends to be in the **maritime environment** with
disputes over]{.underline} the [Paracel and Spratly [Islands in the
**South China Sea**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the
**[Senkaku Islands]{.underline}** [in the **East China
Sea.**]{.underline}

[The Chinese maritime disputes]{.underline} especially in the South
China Sea [are **complex**]{.underline}, [involving multiple overlapping
claims with other regional states but also with other stakeholders who
seek peaceful resolution]{.underline} of claims [and]{.underline}
assurance of [freedom of navigation]{.underline}. The [establishment of
military facilities on the islands, in breach of a ruling of its claim
by The Hague]{.underline}, **[exacerbated the situation]{.underline}**,
leading US and other navies to conduct regular freedom of navigation
exercises through the South China Sea.

In addition to China's ambitions associated with territory in its direct
proximity, China has developed a strategy for its future economy with
the Belt and Road Initiative. Critics of this strategy assert that the
associated infrastructure elements of the initiative are essentially an
alternative means of securing key overseas territory, or a new form of
colonialism.41 An obvious example of this strategy is China's effective
acquisition of the port of Hambantota in Sri Lanka.42

[China's approach to its territorial claims is one in which changes are
implemented **incrementally** and thereafter **become the new normal**.
Occupation of South China Sea islands is an example, in]{.underline}
[which China's 2019 Defence White Paper **characterises**]{.underline}
[international **freedom of navigation** as 'countries from outside the
region]{.underline}... **[illegally]{.underline}** [entering **China's
territorial waters**]{.underline}... **[undermining China's national
security']{.underline}**.43

In a 2010 article, [Fravel asserted that China was unlikely to resort to
armed conflict or even aggressive expansionism in pursuing their
territorial claims]{.underline}. 44 **[However]{.underline}**, since
that publication, [we have seen examples]{.underline} in the East and
South China Seas [in which **aggression**]{.underline} [has been
**clear**]{.underline}, [with challenges between **military
platforms**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [with conflict often
**narrowly averted.**]{.underline}

[Despite these tensions and occasional incidents]{.underline}, [China's
conduct of expansionism in the South China Sea primarily has been in the
**grey-zone**]{.underline}, in that [each]{.underline} [step has been
**calculated** to **achieve objectives**]{.underline} [**without
crossing a threshold of** **warfare**.]{.underline} However, [can we
consider it to be hybrid warfare?]{.underline} That is, has the
posturing of forces been complemented by other activities to achieve
their goals? Hoffman regards China as being 'well organized to conduct
operations short of military conflict'45 utilising three forms of
nonwarfare, namely noncontact (fei jierong), nonlinear (fei xianshi) and
nonsymmetric (fei duicheng)'.46

Such influence activities are widely suspected to be behind the
Philippines government's softening of their stance against China in
relation to the South China Seas dispute.47 Such influence may be
overtly undertaken through incentives such as Belt and Road Initiative
agreements, although there is evidence that such initiatives can have a
covert element and take advantage of corrupt regimes.48 Influence can
extend to attempted corruption of Western politicians to advocate for
Chinese policies over the dispute.49 China more broadly exerts influence
through a combination of political warfare activities, including
mobilisation of diasporas, tasking of students, financial assistance to
individuals and institutions, economic manipulation and large-scale
cyber and other information operations.50

Hybrid Lawfare -- exploiting the legal grey-zone of modern conflict

[Hybrid warfare is an open concept with different elements. Lawfare, for
example, is a new aspect of non-kinetic conflict aiming at 'using law as
a weapon to manipulate legal paradigms'.]{.underline}51

[Lawfare is being used by **Russia** and]{.underline}
**[China]{.underline}** ([in the context of the South China Sea as
discussed in this article]{.underline}) both within and outside the
scope of traditional armed conflict. For Russia the use of lawfare is 'a
continuation of its policy of using every tool at its disposal to
achieve its political and geo-strategic goals'52 and a 'force
multiplier' to meet its political, military and legal objectives, as
highlighted in its Military Doctrine of 2014 and its National Security
Strategy of 2015.

[Both China and Russia have been active in the **use** and **abuse** of
the **rule of law** in]{.underline} [order to either **prepare military
action** or]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[justify it]{.underline}**
[**after completion** of the mission]{.underline}. [Russian
justification of the occupation and]{.underline} then subsequent
[annexation of Crimea is an example of the latter]{.underline}; while
the [Chinese justification for its claims over the South China Sea is an
example of the preparation of a legal basis for the potential use of
force in self-defence]{.underline} when protecting own sovereign rights
and (island-) territory.

[Lawfare in conjunction with hybrid warfare 'provides a **layer of
"fake" legitimacy**]{.underline}, or at least [reduces]{.underline} the
[erosion of **apparent legitimacy**]{.underline}, [due to]{.underline}
the **[nonattributable aspects]{.underline}** [inherent in hybrid
warfare]{.underline} while using "easy" hybrid warfare methods'.53
[Lawfare can be used as a method of hybrid warfare or influence
operations]{.underline}.54 US writer, Kittrie came up with the following
test: (1) the actor uses law to create the same or similar effects as
those traditionally sought from conventional kinetic military
actions---including impacting the key armed forces decision-making and
capabilities of the target; and (2) one of the actor's motivations is to
weaken or destroy an adversary against which the lawfare is being
deployed.55

Russia's use of lawfare in Ukraine thus exploits both (1) the undefined
definition of the conflict as aggression and (2) the unwillingness of
the international community to label it as such. And, it maintains
uncertainty through a strategic (dis)information campaign which keeps
the nature of the conflict open, so it is unclear whether it is
international armed conflict, non-international armed conflict or civil
unrest.56 Here clear parallels regarding China's actions in the South
China Sea can be drawn.

China and Russia's use of the 'weaponisation' of the maritime
environment as grey-zone tactics or consolidation of a hybrid warfare
based approach

We are now turning to the example for such a lawfare approach: the
so-called weaponising of the maritime environment through terraforming
as part of a multifaceted security strategy. [China's Defence Minister,
Wei Fenghe, argued]{.underline} in 2018 that, '[The islands in the South
China Sea have long been China's territory]{.underline}. They're the
legacy of our ancestors and we can't afford to lose a single inch of
them'.57

[Officially]{.underline}, [China claims]{.underline} that [its overall
intention was to use the extension of its territorial waters peacefully
and to serve solely its commercial needs]{.underline}. [This is
**doubtful**, given that China has **actively weaponised** the **claimed
territories**.]{.underline} Sumihiko Kawamura, a former rear admiral and
commander of Japan's Maritime Self-Defence Force's antisubmarine air
wing, suspects that [China wants to use the South China Sea as leverage
against the US Pacific security projection.]{.underline} Kawamura
believes [Beijing is trying to turn the South China Sea into 'a **safe
haven'**]{.underline} [for its **nuclear-powered
submarines**]{.underline}, [which are **armed with ballistic missiles**
that can reach the United States]{.underline}. 58

In this context, it [is worthwhile to note that China did **lose its
case** for claiming the SCS waters in a 2015 case brought before the UN
Permanent Court of Arbitration by]{.underline} one of the affected
states, [the Philippines. China therefore failed]{.underline}
spectacularly [with its attempt to successfully use lawfare]{.underline}
by manipulating the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea to argue own sovereign rights (like exclusive economic
and fishing rights) over the majority of the SCS waterways.59 [China
later decided to **ignore the ruling**]{.underline} [and to
**consolidate its illegal position**]{.underline} [further by
**illegally maintaining**, and even **expanding**]{.underline},
[so-called **E**xclusive **E**conomic **Z**one**s**]{.underline} [in the
disputed SCS waters]{.underline}.60 [This consolidation manifests
itself]{.underline} in Chinese **[below the threshold]{.underline}**
**[grey-zone tactics]{.underline}** [like]{.underline}
**[policing]{.underline}** [its falsely claimed territorial waters
around]{.underline} **[artificially built islands]{.underline}**,
**[interference]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}
**[air-traffic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[challenging US and
allied navies]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} [their rightful freedom of
seas navigation patrols]{.underline}, to name just a few examples.61
[China has created, like Russia in respect to the illegally annexed
Crimea, **a fait accompli.**]{.underline}

In Russia's case, immediately following the annexation of Crimea in
2014, Russia began the planning and construction of the Crimean Bridge
over the Kerch Strait in Ukraine to support its territorial claims. The
project was successfully completed in May 2018 as the so-called
Unification Bridge and was followed subsequently by Russian military
action to ensure regional observance of the new status quo.62 Russian
naval units attacked and boarded three Ukrainian vessels in autumn 2018
for having allegedly violated Russian territorial waters when passing
through the Kerch Strait.63 What became known as the 'Kerch Strait'
incident was followed by the effective closure of a part of the Sea of
Azov waterway whenever Russia decided to conduct live fire naval
exercise,64 thus violating Ukrainian territorial waters, as the
annexation of Crimea was and continues to be regarded as illegal.65

Russia's actions can be seen as consolidation action of its gains from
its successful hybrid warfare campaign against the Ukrainian state when
seizing Crimea. With the annexation complete and little to fear in terms
of military action or meaningful sanctions, Russia can now resort to the
use of traditional hard power in consolidating and protecting its
position.

Both China and Russia have provided examples of how territorial gains
made through hybrid warfare and grey-zone tactics can be weaponised
further to serve wider national security aims and ambitions by
warranting the question of how to respond in an effective manner.

[Russian warfighting stratagems as **dangerous precedent**]{.underline}

The question arises of what is new in Russian warfare since 2008. Among
a host of features of the new war some are indeed noteworthy: the
non-declaration of war, the use of armed civilians, non-contact clashes
like the blockade of military installations by 'protestors', the use of
asymmetric and indirect methods, simultaneous battle on land, air, sea,
and in the informational space, and the management of troops in a
unified informational sphere.66

The authors have written extensively about hybrid warfare and its
Russian equivalent as reflexive control67 and nonlinear warfare. Russian
Hybrid Warfare has become known as the so-called 'Gerasimov'
doctrine68--- though while Western military authors (including us)
continue to use this reference, it is at least questionable if General
Gerasimov actually intended to have his thoughts and reflections on
evolving Russian military operational approaches be regarded as a
military 'doctrine' in a strict sense.69 So, while the existence of such
a doctrine is debatable, the overall success of contemporary Russian
warfighting is not, and the term hybrid warfare is a good
characterisation of Russia's contemporary aggressive foreign policy.

The actual **[consequences]{.underline}** [of Russia's hybrid warfare
are **far-reaching**]{.underline}. [Russia's foreign policy (and also
China's) of assertive **nationalist posturing**,
**meddling**]{.underline} [in internal affairs, **political
warfare**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} **[hybrid
warfare]{.underline}** [disrupt]{.underline} the Western narrative of
**[globalisation]{.underline}**, **[rule of law]{.underline}**,
**[democracy]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[interconnectivity]{.underline}**. This [creates an **untenable
situation**]{.underline} [where the West is responding to **ad hoc
threats**]{.underline} [in an **increasingly less assertive
way**]{.underline} [instead of **defining** and]{.underline}
**[implementing]{.underline}** [a]{.underline} joint [foreign policy
that would **deter** such an adversary]{.underline}.

[[Russia's]{.mark} version of [hybrid
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} whether we refer to it as
Gerasimov's doctrine, Russian Hybrid Warfare or reflective control,
[[has been **successful**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Firstly, Russia proved
successfully 'that this warfare not only includes nonstate actors but
also states']{.underline}.70 [Secondly, it proved the effectiveness of
this form of warfare because Russia's departure from its reliance on
kinetic resources]{.underline} also [[reduced]{.mark} the [need for
using **conventional military power**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in a
**conventional sense**]{.underline}, [which **benefits** the
'**weaker'**]{.underline} [opponent]{.underline}. And
[thirdly]{.underline}, [hybrid warfare as part of a **wider**
**information-operation**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[lawfare]{.underline}** [approach [provided]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[false legitimacy]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[due to]{.mark}
**attribution questions**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[potential for denial]{.mark}]{.underline}** by [the target state for
political reasons]{.underline}. [This [**Russian success**]{.mark} with
hybrid warfare [is]{.mark} [what China]{.mark} [seems to be
**emulating**]{.mark} in]{.underline} [respect to its current
territorial expansion: [the use **of 'little blue
men'**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[info]{.mark}rmation

strategy.

U.S. Complacency, and How We Got There

Noted George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen and other
[[experts]{.mark} have [recognized]{.mark} a
[growing]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[complacency]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[in American life as the indicator of a **societal shift**]{.underline}
[from the United States' **early dynamism**]{.underline}. From the turn
of the twentieth century until roughly the moon landing of 1969, the
breakneck pace of groundbreaking technologies that directly affected the
quality of life and the structure of U.S. society was simply astounding.
Yet, [[since the]{.mark} first [moon landing]{.mark} in 1969, [**only**
the **internet**]{.mark} and its]{.underline}
**[application]{.underline}** to more and more parts of our lives [can
claim to have [made a]{.mark}ny **[meaningful
impact]{.mark}**]{.underline}[---]{.mark}meaning that physically the
world of 1969 is much more like that of 2021 than 1969 was of the early
twentieth century. This, of course, is not meant to discredit the great
advances in medicine and human genomics made in the last few decades,
for example, but to show how [the [**rate** of
**society-changing**]{.mark} [**innovations** has **not**
**maintained**]{.mark} the **[pace]{.mark}** that existed from the
**mid-nineteenth century**]{.underline} [until roughly

[In the developed world, [this slowdown]{.mark} has unfortunately
[contributed to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[wage

[**[shrinking]{.mark}** of]{.underline} [[the **middle

the **waning** days of the **Soviet Union's power** in the 1980s, the
U.S. **innovation decline** was **masked** at home.]{.underline}
Further, the Soviets of that period no longer posed a technological
threat to the United States. Japan on the other hand, posed a great
technological threat in the 1980s but was and is a staunch U.S. ally,
and not a security threat. Unchallenged abroad and riding the dual-edged
optimism of the internet boom of the 1990s and the victory over
communism, the United States missed the ways in which it was giving up
the advantages that made it such a powerhouse in the mid-twentieth
century.

#### US manufacturing and high-tech innovation are both in deep decline.

THE CASE FOR ACTION

[Before describing the **chain of logic** that points directly to the
**need** for an **advanced-industry strategy**, it's important to lay
out the **case** for]{.underline} [some sort of action. In short: [Over
the **last two decades**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [the
**U.S.**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**economy** has **[lost its
competitiveness edge]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Perhaps [[the **most obvious sign**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of U.S.
economic decline [has been]{.mark} the [**erosion** of]{.mark} the
country's **[manufacturing]{.mark} base**]{.underline}. From 2001 to
2010, [the United States lost **42,400 factories**]{.underline}
(three-quarters of which employed at least 500 workers while in
operation), 32 percent of its manufacturing jobs, and much of its
technical edge.1

[Since then there has been **further erosion**]{.underline}. From 2007
to 2019, [while **GDP grew** by **22 percent**]{.underline}, **[real
manufacturing value-added]{.underline}** [grew by just **5.6
percent**]{.underline}. As [a result, [manufacturing's **share**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} gross domestic product ([**[GDP]{.underline}**)
**[fell]{.underline}**]{.mark} from 13.2 percent to 11.4 percent. [This
also **obscures** **significant differences**]{.underline} **[within
industry sectors]{.underline}**. [All of the eight nondurable goods
sectors]{.underline} (such as paper, chemicals, and plastics) [produced
**less** in **absolute terms**]{.underline} [in 2019 than they did in
2007]{.underline}. Moreover, as a number of analysts---including the
Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF)---have shown,
the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) significantly overstated the
output growth of the computer sector (NIACS 334) because it assumes that
when a computer doubles in speed due to Moore's Law, actual output also
doubles. Leaving out the production of computers---most of which has
moved overseas---U.S. manufacturing output actually declined by 3
percent.

[Just as troubling is that U.S. manufacturing is in a **productivity
slump**]{.underline}. [In 15 out of 18 years from 1990 to]{.underline}
[2007, **manufacturing productivity** grew]{.underline}
**[faster]{.underline}** [than overall non-farm business
productivity]{.underline}, often by more than twice as much. [But
between 2008 and 2019, manufacturing productivity grew faster in just
**3** of the]{.underline} [12 years]{.underline}. [In 2019]{.underline},
while business productivity grew 1.9 percent, [manufacturing
productivity grew just **0.1 percent.**]{.underline} One reason for this
might be U.S. manufacturers increased capital expenditures by just 17
percent between 2008 and 2017 (the latest year for which data is
available), or one-third the rate of the information sector (e.g.,
Internet, communications, etc.). [Without robust productivity growth,
manufacturing gets **less competitive globally**, which is why it grows
**more slowly than GDP.**]{.underline}

One would think, with manufacturing productivity growing more slowly
than the rest of the economy, job growth would be robust (and as other
sectors become relatively more efficient). But at the end of 2019,
manufacturing employment was still 6.5 percent below its pre-recession
levels.

But [even if [America is]{.mark} losing manufacturing, surely it is
still [leading in **innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[right?]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[So goes the thinking]{.underline}**
([as if manufacturing is not innovative]{.underline}). [[But on **many
measures**]{.mark}, [when **controlling**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for the
**size** of the **economy**]{.mark}---such as government and business
research and development (R&D) expenditures and patenting---[the United
States is **no longer the leader**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [It
ranks]{.underline}]{.mark} [**12th** in **patent cooperation treaty
patents**]{.underline} [filed as **share of GDP,** **23rd** in
**researchers per capita**]{.underline}, [**[27th]{.underline}** [in
**high-tech exports**]{.underline}]{.mark} [as share of trade,
and]{.underline} **[44th]{.underline}** [in **scientific and technical
articles**]{.underline} [as a share of GDP]{.underline}.2 Moreover, [in
2019, the United States [ran an **all-time-high trade deficit**]{.mark}
of \$132 billion [in **advanced tech**]{.mark}**nology
products**]{.underline}, down from a \$4.5 billion trade surplus in
2001.3 With China, the trade deficit in electronic products was \$184
billion in 2017, as U.S. exports totaled just \$21 billion.4

[Also, [many **once-iconic**]{.mark} U.S. [**advanced-industry
firms**]{.mark} have [**lost** **significant global market
share**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[or]{.mark} even **[gone out of
business]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Forbes issues a list of the **top
2,000 firms each year**]{.underline}. To be sure, [from 2006 to
2019,]{.underline} [a number of U.S. technology firms **increased**
their **global ranks** significantly, particularly in software
(e.g.,]{.underline} Microsoft); [semiconductors]{.underline} (e.g.,

THE CHINESE JUGGERNAUT

The [**[changes]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} American
[**[innovation]{.underline}** [would matter less if the
**world**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[had [remained
unipolar]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead, [they occurred **alongside the
rise of a geopolitical**]{.underline} [rival]{.underline}. Over the past
two decades, [[China]{.mark} has [evolved]{.mark} from a country that
largely]{.underline} **[steals and imitates]{.underline}** [technology
[to one that]{.mark} now also **improves and even [pioneers
it]{.mark}**[. This is **no accident**]{.mark}]{.underline}; it is the
result of the state's deliberate, long-term focus. China has invested
massively in R & D, with its share of global technology spending growing
from under five percent in 2000 to over 23 [percent]{.underline} in
2020. If current trends continue, China is expected to overtake the
United States in such spending by 2025.

Central to China's drive has been a strategy of "military-civil fusion,"
a coordinated effort to ensure cooperation between the private sector
and the defense industry. At the national, provincial, and local levels,
the state backs the efforts of military organizations, state-owned
enterprises, and private companies and entrepreneurs. Support might come
in the form of research grants, shared data, government-backed loans, or
training programs. It might even be as simple as the provision of land
or office space; the government is creating whole new cities dedicated
solely to innovation.

[[China's investment in **5G**]{.underline}]{.mark} technology
[[shows]{.mark} how [the **process**]{.mark} **works in
practice**]{.underline}. [Equipment for 5G makes up the **backbone of a
country's cellular network**]{.underline} [infrastructure]{.underline},
and the Chinese company [Huawei has emerged as a **world leader in
engineering**]{.underline} [and **selling it**]{.underline}---offering
high-quality products at a lower price than its Finnish and South Korean
competitors. The company has been buoyed by massive state support---by
The Wall Street Journal's count, some \$75 billion in tax breaks,
grants, loans, and discounts on land. Huawei has also benefited from
China's Belt and Road Initiative, which provides generous loans to
countries and Chinese companies to finance infrastructure construction.

Massive **[state [investments]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in **artificial
intelligence**]{.underline} [have]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[paid
off]{.mark}. Chinese researchers now publish more **scientific
papers**]{.underline} [in that field than **American** ones do. Part of
this success is the]{.underline} [**result of funding**, but something
else plays a big role: access to **enormous amounts of
data**]{.underline}. [[Beijing has fueled]{.mark} the rise of
**[powerhouse companies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that sweep up endless
information **about their users**. These include
**[Alibaba]{.mark}**]{.underline}, an e-commerce giant;
**[[Tencent]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which developed the all-purpose
WeChat app; **[[Baidu]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which began as a search
engine but now offers a range of online products;
**[[DJI]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which dominates the consumer drone
market; [[and **SenseTime**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which provides facial
recognition technology for China's video surveillance network and is
said to be the world's most valuable artificial intelligence company. As
a matter of law, these companies are required to cooperate with the
state for intelligence purposes, a broad mandate that is almost
certainly used to force companies to share data for many other reasons.

That information increasingly involves people living outside China.
Chinese companies have woven a global web of data-gathering apps that
collect foreigners' private information about their finances, their
search history, their location, and more. Those who make a mobile
payment through a Chinese app, for example, could have their personal
data routed through Shanghai and added to China's growing trove of
knowledge about foreign nationals. Such information no doubt makes it
easier for the Chinese government to track, say, an indebted Western
bureaucrat who could be convinced to spy for Beijing or a Tibetan
activist who has taken refuge abroad.

China's hunger for data extends to some of the most personal information
imaginable: our own DNA. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began,
**[BGI]{.underline}**---a Chinese genome-sequencing company that began
as a government-funded research group---[has broken ground
on]{.underline} some 50 **[new laboratories]{.underline}** [abroad
designed to help governments **test for the virus**]{.underline}. China
has legitimate reasons to build these labs, but it also has an ugly
record of forcibly collecting DNA data from Tibetans and Uighurs as part
of its efforts to monitor these minorities. Given that BGI runs China's
national library of genomics data, it is conceivable that through BGI
testing, foreigners' biological data might end up in that repository.

Indeed, China has shown great interest in biotechnology, even if it has
yet to catch up to the United States. Combined with massive computing
power and artificial intelligence, innovations in biotechnology could
help solve some of humanity's most vexing challenges, from disease and
famine to energy production and climate change. Researchers have
mastered the gene-editing tool CRISPR, allowing them to grow wheat that
resists disease, and have managed to encode video in the DNA of
bacteria, raising the possibility of a new, cost-effective method of
data storage. Specialists in synthetic biology have invented a new way
of producing nylon---with genetically engineered microorganisms instead
of petrochemicals. The economic implications of the coming biotechnology
revolution are staggering: the McKinsey Global Institute has estimated
the value of biotechnology's many potential applications at up to \$4
trillion over the next ten to 20 years.

Like all powerful technologies, however, biotechnology has a dark side.
It is not inconceivable, for example, that some malicious actor could
create a biological weapon that targeted a specific ethnic group. On
controversial questions---such as how much manipulation of the human
genome is acceptable---countries will accept different degrees of risk
in the name of progress and take different ethical positions. The
country that leads biotechnology's development will be the one that most
profoundly shapes the norms and standards around its use. And there is
reason to worry if that country is China. In 2018, the Chinese scientist
He Jiankui genetically engineered the DNA of twin babies, prompting an
international uproar. Beijing portrayed him as a rogue researcher and
punished him. Yet the Chinese government's disdain for human rights,
coupled with its quest for technological supremacy, suggests that it
could embrace a lax, even dangerous approach to bioethics.

THINKING BIGGER

[**[Washington]{.underline}** [has monitored
China's]{.underline}]{.mark} [technological [progress through **a
military lens**]{.mark}, worrying about how it contributes to Chinese
**defense capabilities**]{.underline}. But [[the **challenge is much
broader**. China's push for]{.mark} [**technological supremacy** is
not]{.mark} simply [aimed at]{.mark} **gaining [a battlefield]{.mark}
advantage**; [Beijing is changing the **battlefield
itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although commercial technologies such as
5G, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and biotechnology will
undoubtedly have military applications, [[China envisions]{.mark} a
world of **great-power** competition in which **[no shots]{.mark}** need
to be fired. [Technological supremacy **promises**]{.mark} **the
[ability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to **dominate** the **civilian
infrastructure**]{.mark} on which **others depend**, [providing]{.mark}
enormous [**influence**. That is a **major motivation** behind Beijing's
support]{.mark} for **high-tech civilian infrastructure**]{.underline}
[exports. The countries buying Chinese systems may **think they are
merely receiving** electric grids]{.underline}, health-care technology,
or online payment systems, but in reality, they may also be placing
critical national infrastructure and citizens' data in Beijing's hands.
[Such exports are China's **Trojan horse.**]{.underline}

### Innovation DA\-\--Link Turn

#### Article 5 clarification key to [enable]{.underline} operational planning

Piret **Pernik 14**, Researcher of Strategy Branch of the NATO CCDCOE,
"Improving Cyber Security: NATO and the EU," International Centre for
Defence Studies, September 2014,

[Operational planning]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[capabilities
development]{.underline}**

A report by the defence committee of the UK parliament finds that [NATO
is **poorly prepared**]{.underline} [to respond to the Russia's use of
asymmetric warfare]{.underline}, [including cyber attacks,]{.underline}
[information and psychological operations.]{.underline} The
[committee]{.underline} [urges the Alliance to develop its own
asymmetrical]{.underline} [warfare capabilities]{.underline}, discuss
how to deal with these attacks and operations, and mount its own
offensive operations.58 . It [also calls NATO to **re-examine** the
**legal** and]{.underline} **[military]{.underline}**
**[doctrines]{.underline}**, **[criteria]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[responses]{.underline}** [for the declaration and
use of]{.underline} both Article 4 and **[Article 5.]{.underline}**59
Likewise, James Stavridis, retired NATO\'s Supreme Allied Commander
(SACEUR) believes NATO should stand up a cyber defence operations force
under the SACEUR, as well as explore the utility of offensive cyber
weapons.60 The need to integrate cyber into NATO's military operations
and operational planning has been acknowledged also by Jamie Shea.61
**[[Operational planning]{.underline}]{.mark}** [both [for **Article
5**]{.mark} [and **non-Article 5 events**]{.mark} **[along
with]{.mark}** **[capability development]{.mark}** [must be]{.mark}
[adjusted]{.mark} to the reality of asymmetrical or hybrid
warfare]{.underline} that employs a range of tools, including
information operations and cyber attacks.

In addition to the need to integrate cyber into both military and civil
emergency operational planning, NATO must improve the interoperability
of cyber capabilities of the Allies and this process can be facilitated
by the means that will be provided by the newly established NATO's cyber
range.

Furthermore, [[realistic]{.mark} **[cyber]{.mark} threat
[scenarios]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [[as well as]{.mark}
**[clear]{.mark}** and tested **[response
procedures]{.mark}**]{.underline} and **[mechanisms]{.underline}**
[[should be in place]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Operational [**contingency
plans** must **clarify**]{.mark} **[which
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [NATO [nations are **prepared** to
**make available**]{.mark} **to the Alliance**]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} the [**mechanisms** for **collective**]{.mark}
**[assistance]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by the individual
Allies]{.underline}. A full range of response options (including kinetic
means) accompanied by appropriate plans and capabilities need to be
worked out. Since a simultaneous strike against NATO's own and the
member state's infrastructure is likely, it would be prudent to ensure
enough common capabilities to respond to both tasks. The existing two
small RRTS consisting of a permanent core of six experts may be
inadequate for simultaneous tasks.

[[In order to **enable**]{.mark} **military [operational
planning]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[NATO should consider]{.mark} the
development of **[cyber warfare doctrine]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It
should establish a joint cyber command or headquarters (not unlike the
Special Operations Headquarters), aligning joint strategy with political
ends, at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). Concerns
about the legality of an offensive action in cyberspace aside, while
NATO does not have an offensive cyber capability, member states'
capabilities could be used under Article 5 circumstances. [NATO needs to
ponder]{.underline} also [what could be done to **help an
Ally**]{.underline} [experiencing a cyber attack]{.underline} causing
serious damage to its private critical infrastructure.

#### Setting a framework for cyber defense is also key to [tech innovation]{.underline}

Setting the stage

[[Cyber-security is yet to be]{.mark} **globally**]{.underline},
[**[legally]{.underline}**, **[operationally]{.underline}**]{.mark},
[and]{.underline} **[strategically]{.underline}**
**[[defined]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The scale of a security perspective
is more attractive at this time considering the geostrategic challenges
and threats. [The [possibility of **innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[entrepreneurship]{.underline}** [in the field
[is]{.mark} also a **[tangible]{.mark} reality**,]{.underline} [due to
the necessary research and development methods]{.underline}. More so,
the possibility of an open market economy sharing of knowledge and
technological skills makes security and cyber-security or defense for
that matter more attractive. [What **[lacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in
the world wide [**legal** and **political**]{.mark} **[framework of
operations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[exchange of
info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}** and protectiveness from new sources
or methods that can be deemed as elements of infiltration.

The article's aim is to examine and recommend a global strategic
framework for operational capacity and management resilience between
allied and cooperative partners in the field of cyber-security. The
current article is a follow up of prior scientific publications made in
2014 first and later in 2018, on NATO's cyber-security strategy,
presented through a framework of Cyber-Development, Cyber-Democracy, and
Cyber-Defense (Carayannis, Campbell & Efthymiopoulos, 2014; Carayannis,
Campbell & Efthymiopoulos, 2018). The aim is to converge diversified
information on cyber-security, in a single strategic framework; reflect
to the actual practical needs in understanding operations and tactical
ability to deliver in multi-complex and dimensional world through
management and operational efficiency capabilities. The article requests
interoperability of aims and objectives under a global framework of
cyber-security; through a strategic framework on cyber-security, global
law can be proposed, defined, and adopted by the international
community. The [**[strategic framework]{.underline}** [will define
**structures**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that are [needed]{.mark} to be put
in place]{.underline} on a global scale, [when reflecting issues of
cyber-security]{.underline} and inclusive [[for
**NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It will define threats and challenges, as
cyber-attacks are real. [Cyber-security is not an
asymmetrical]{.underline} or hybrid [threat, but an **existential
one.**]{.underline} Its destructive capacity can be multi-leveled and
can also lead to human casualties. The future of e-safety lays at both a
global estimation framework of what constitutes cyber-security and how
we react to it; it lays in between cooperation of allies and members of
wider alliances, against specified or approximate threats. [Yet, its
**framework** of aims and objectives, **management**, command and
control, and operations will be defined and decided by **allied
parties**]{.underline} only [such as]{.underline} is the case of
[**NATO**.]{.underline}

**[[Operationally]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[national]{.underline}]{.mark} and cooperative [[forces]{.mark} [need
to be]{.mark} **continuously [agile]{.mark}** [and **technologically
advanced**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In an asymmetrical world, which is
complete with unforeseen challenges and threats, we need forces with
**flexibility**]{.underline}, **[adaptability]{.underline}**,
[operational and strategic command structure,]{.underline} based on high
technologically sophisticated information "coming in," but also being
used while in training or through active operations.

On a theoretical scale, the current [article requests a cyber-security
**strategic framework**]{.underline} [adoption of
**resilient**]{.underline} **[adaptability]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[interoperability policy]{.underline}** in the
framework of safety and defense. The article considers that
[understanding the realities of threats is]{.underline} by definition [a
natural innovation and as we move ahead,]{.underline} we structure and
operate a single strategy on cyber-security against a virtual threat
from wherever it comes from. [Its long-term [resilience may be]{.mark}
more **[complex]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[as **operational
capacity**]{.mark} [needs to]{.mark} constantly **develop** and
**[adapt]{.mark}**]{.underline} into the convergence of societal
structures, and methods; where socio-economic, technological, defense
even health, and education issues are affected.

[When theory on cyber-security, resilience, and operational capacity
will be applied at NATOs level, it will **enable allies** and members,
jointly, to create a **true policy** and]{.underline}
**[strategy]{.underline}** [for cyber-security resilience]{.underline}
[against **hybrid virtual threats**]{.underline}. The methodology on how
to is presented through this current article.

The article's design is based on cross-disciplinary and
interdisciplinary approaches. It combines elements of global security
and strategy, national and international law, economic development, and
technological research and advancement and most importantly is
innovative and entrepreneurial; its understanding will enable us to
comprehend global and regional market establishment and convergence, as
also economic changes. The setting of the study required lapse of time
to showcase the need and the necessity of the subject. Current output
reflects a set of written analyses, rules, and primary experiences. It
methodologically acquired sources of information of related necessity
and relevance, shaped the understanding, and need to point out for a
framework of rules, regulations, management, and operations on
cyber-security.

The article and its author frames a specific policy recommendation with
regards to the creation of not only a regional alliance (NATO-based
scale), Cyber-Security Strategy for the twenty-first century but a
global one. The article defines the "dynamism" of cyber-security both as
a topic and subject. Cyber-security is a twenty-first century element of
policy orientation; a necessity for both collective and individual
defense and security resilience.

In specific, [a [**cyber-security strategy** for NATO will **enhance its
innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[creativity]{.underline}** core of operations and methodologies
[against any kind of virtual threats. It [will set
**standards**]{.mark}, **policy procedures**]{.underline}, and
recommendations. [NATO's strategy of cyber-security]{.underline} through
its new Cyberspace Operations Centre, in Mons (Belgium) as decided in
the Brussels Summit of July 2018 (Cyber-Space Operations Center Mons

Through a methodological period, such as in the NATO Summit in Brussels
of July 2018, NATO will now have to show an enhanced progress report
within the second quarter of 2019, assuring current and future abilities
also in cyber-security, to counter current and emerging challenges in
cyber-space. **[Defense planning,]{.underline}**
**[operations]{.underline}**, and lessons learned [are]{.underline}

to target individual members of al Qaeda in the Federally Administered
Tribal Areas may reflect such a secret tacit arrangement.37 Some of
these secret arrangements explicitly state that the parties do not

Compared to secret agreements (at least those to which the United States

#### AFF popular OR no one cares

"NATO's Dirty Little Secret Is Out," CATO, 12/4/19,
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/natos-dirty-little-secret-out

[**Few** (**if any**) surveys of **U.S. public opinion** about **NATO**
**even hint**]{.underline} [about the extent of the **risks** Americans
incur because of Washington's **obligations under Article
5**]{.underline} of the North Atlantic Treaty, [which commits the
signatories to consider an attack on any member as an attack on all. A
typical poll question will ask respondents whether the United States
should defend country X, if Russia attacks that country]{.underline}. [A
**more honest question** would be whether the United States should
defend country X from a Russian attack, **even if doing so might result
in a nuclear war** with Russia that could **kill millions of
Americans.**]{.underline}

Granted, such an outcome is a worst‐​case scenario, but Washington's
Article 5 obligations bring it into play. [The escalation risk is
especially relevant with respect to defending Estonia and the other
Baltic republics]{.underline}. A 2016 RAND Corporation study concluded
that it would be nearly impossible for NATO to defend its Baltic members
against a full‐​scale Russian invasion for more than a few days without
an extensive upgrade of the Alliance's existing force deployment. Even
after such an upgrade, the outcome of a struggle waged solely with
conventional weapons would be uncertain. Escalation to the nuclear level
would remain an ever‐​present danger.

[Even without a robust "truth in advertising" requirement, U.S[.
**public support** for NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}
**[slipping]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Mark Hannah, a senior fellow at the
Eurasia Group Foundation, concedes that point following a survey his
organization recently conducted. He notes: ["For a second year in a row,
[when faced with a hypothetical scenario]{.mark} [in which Russia
invaded Estonia]{.mark}, a NATO ally, [Americans were]{.mark} roughly
**[split]{.mark}** on whether they wanted the United]{.underline}
[States to **respond militarily**]{.underline}. [And that was
**after**]{.underline} [respondents were reminded of Article
5]{.underline}, the part of the NATO treaty that obligates the United
States to respond to such aggression, [and after they were told that
U.S. action could be the only way to expel Russia."]{.underline}

[In other words, [even with wording **designed to elicit positive
responses**]{.mark}---[and **no disclosure** of]{.mark} [a]{.mark}
potentially **dire [nuclear risk]{.mark}** arising from America's
military obligation to a NATO ally---[the survey showed **no**
]{.mark}**clear [public mandate]{.mark}** [for defending]{.mark} that
ally.]{.underline} Hannah concludes[: "**[It's not just]{.mark}**
President Donald [**Trump** who is **skeptical**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[of the North Atlantic allianc]{.underline}e, in other words**[. [It's
the American peopl]{.mark}e]{.underline}**. [[To the extent that U.S.
citizens **think about NATO at all**]{.underline},
[they]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[disagree]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[about
whether honoring]{.mark} its [commitments would be **worth the
sacrifice**]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark} He's correct, [[and if they
were **explicitly told**]{.mark} [about the nuclear risk]{.mark}, it is
highly probable that [**anti‐​NATO sentiment** would
**surge**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### No Link\-\--Not Perceived

#### Foreign policy doesn't matter on the political stage

Roundup: Foreign Policy Is AWOL", Council on Foreign Relations,
9/11/2020,
https://www.cfr.org/blog/campaign-foreign-policy-roundup-foreign-policy-awol

Today on the nineteenth anniversary of September 11 [[it is **notable**
how **little** of]{.mark} the [2020]{.mark} presidential campaign [has
been]{.mark} about **[fo]{.mark}**reign **[po]{.mark}**licy. It's not
just terrorism that has **receded from the headlines**. The same could
be said about China, Russia, Iran, and a **whole host of other
issues**]{.underline}.

To an extent, the fact that **[[fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy [has
been AWOL on the campaign trail]{.mark}]{.underline}** isn't surprising.
[**[Domestic issues]{.mark}** typically **[dominate]{.mark}**
presidential campaigns, [and **COVID**]{.mark}**-19** [is]{.mark}
perhaps **[the mother of all domestic issues]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It
has upended the economy, disrupted daily life, and exacerbated existing
racial and social inequalities. Even so, it was only a few months ago
that some experts were speculating that COVID-19 would catapult U.S.
policy toward China to the forefront of the campaign and give Donald
Trump a cudgel with which to beat Joe Biden. So far that hasn't
happened.

[[This]{.mark} state of affairs seems to [fit the **public
mood**]{.mark}. A Pew survey]{.underline} of registered voters conducted
this summer [found]{.underline} that [57 percent]{.underline} of
registered voters [said that foreign policy was "very
important"]{.underline} to them when voting. [That sounds like an
impressive figure, but 79 percent of respondents flagged the economy as
"very important" and 68 percent flagged health care. [Voters accord
**even less importance** to **specific**]{.mark} foreign policy [issues.
Pew]{.mark}]{.underline} reported that just 42 percent of respondents
said climate change was important to their vote, and it [[**didn't even
bother** to ask about terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}.

But [among Democratic primary]{.underline} [voters]{.underline},
[[there\'s]{.underline} **[little interest]{.underline}**]{.mark}. A
recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found [[just]{.underline} **[11
percent]{.underline}**]{.mark} of respondents [[said]{.underline}
**[national security]{.underline}**]{.mark} and terrorism [[should
be]{.mark} the [top priority]{.mark}]{.underline} of the federal
government, [[down from]{.underline}]{.mark} **[21]{.underline}**
percent [at a similar point in [the last]{.mark} presidential
[election]{.mark} cycle.]{.underline} And [those questions rarely get
put to candidates by voters as they visit the early voting states around
the country.]{.underline} [\"[It\'s]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[hard to get
people to care about fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy]{.underline}**,
generally,\" said Tommy Vietor, a former Obama national security
spokesperson who now hosts Pod Save the World, a foreign policy spinoff
of the popular Pod Save America podcast. But he predicted candidates
won\'t be able to avoid the issues forever and noted that foreign policy
is the one place where presidents can implement their vision without
worrying too much about Congress or the courts. \"It\'s surprising to me
how much time candidates spend debating policy that they may never end
up getting through Congress when, on foreign policy, as president, you
have full latitude to act on your own,\" he said. One reason is that
**[few]{.underline}** [of the Democratic]{.underline} presidential
[[candidates]{.mark} have much experience in international relations and
may feel more **comfortable**]{.underline} [**[stick]{.mark}**ing
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**familiar [domestic turf]{.mark}**,
especially [when **voters aren\'t demanding
it**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [It]{.underline} **[used]{.underline}**
[to be accepted as **fact**]{.underline} [that no one could win the
White House without passing the \"commander-in-chief
test,\"]{.underline} which meant projecting strength, a steady hand and
expertise on national security, but recent elections have scrambled the
rules of American politics. [Clinton **twice tried and failed to exploit
the test**]{.underline}. First, in 2008 against Obama, her campaign
produced an ad asking voters if they wanted Obama, an inexperienced
freshman senator from Illinois, answering a 3 a.m. phone call about a
global crisis. Then, Clinton and her allies tried in 2016 when they
borrowed the mushroom cloud page from Lyndon Johnson\'s playbook to
question Trump\'s temperament. In both cases, her successful opponents
countered that they had better judgment on world affairs, even if she
had more experience. Stephen Miles, the director of Win Without War, a
progressive national security coalition, said Trump was effective in
2016 by painting Democrats as defenders of a creaky foreign policy
establishment that had led to endless wars, controversial trade deals
and pointless foreign aggression. In 2020, he said, candidates should
offer an alternative not only to Trump, but also to the old way of doing
things. \"Trying to defend the failed status quo is not going to fly, so
what is your take?" he said. But he pointed to some candidates who have
started to take steps to do that, even if it\'s far from being the
centerpieces of their campaigns. Sanders has given some speeches on
foreign policy, hired a well-known adviser and pushed congressional
resolutions against the Trump administration's policy toward the Yemeni
civil war. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who joined the Senate Armed
Services Committee a few years ago in part to bolster her limited
foreign policy experience, recently has become more active on that panel
and laid out her vision in a speech and article in Foreign Affairs. And
while many Democrats may not agree with her worldview, longshot
contender Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, a military veteran, has made
foreign policy central to her presidential bid. But the candidate with
by far the most experience in that realm is former Vice President Joe
Biden. When speaking, he weaves in stories about world leaders and
mockery of Trump\'s warmth to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \"I know
all the world leaders,\" Biden said in an interview with a South
Carolina NBC affiliate. \"I\'m the guy that told the Chinese that when
they set up these air defense zones, we\'re going to fly right through
them.\" Jesse Lehrich, a foreign policy spokesperson on Clinton\'s 2016
campaign, summed it up: \"I get it --- Democratic [primary
[voters]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[aren\'t clamoring for]{.mark} detailed
[plans on]{.mark} countering terrorism in [the
Sahel]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But there\'s a real opportunity to put
forward an affirmative vision of American leadership.\"

### US Lead Key

#### US lead-initiatives in NATO key to norm building for cyber

Angelo **Sanakli 20**, writer at IAR, 4/30/20, \"America Should Engage
Like-Minded Partners for a Safer Cyberspace\", International Affairs
Review,
https://iar-gwu.org/2020/04/30/america-should-engage-like-minded-partners-for-a-safer-cyberspace/

The United States and twenty-six other nations came together during last
year's United Nations General Assembly to issue a call-to-action on
making cyberspace safer. This came after the United Nations rolled out
two independent norm-building processes on advancing responsible
behavior in cyberspace. Yet [conflicting interests suggest that
[nations]{.mark} [will]{.mark} [not]{.mark} be able to [reach
**consensus**]{.mark}]{.underline} [on new **rules**]{.underline} in
either process anytime soon. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[should instead **engage** like-minded partners]{.mark} to work towards
making cyberspace **safer**]{.underline} for all nations.

Resolutions passed in 2018 established the Open-Ended Working Group
(OEWG) and the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE). The OEWG, supported
by nations including China, Russia, and Iran, is a new norm-building
process with membership open to all nations. The GGE, backed by the
United States and like-minded partners including Australia, France,
Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom is part of a
long-standing existing process with membership limited to twenty-five
nations. Neither [group has yet to reach **consensus** on **new
norms.**]{.underline}

[The last set of norms came in 2015 during a previous GGE. It set out
that nations should not carry out cyber acts that seek to
**intentionally damage** other nations' critical
infrastructure,]{.underline} such as power grids, water supplies, and
financial services. The GGE [process came to an abrupt end in 2017 owing
to **considerable push back**]{.underline} [from China,
Russia]{.underline}, and Cuba. They opposed majority positions on the
right to self-defense and the application of international humanitarian
law, which regulates the humanitarian aspects of armed conflict.
Conflicting interests on rules on, or related to, "free internet" and
"cyber sovereignty" will continue to play out in both GGE and OEWG
talks. Future push-back will only continue to stifle progress on
norm-building. [So what does this mean for the United
States?]{.underline}

[The United States needs to **engage like-minded
partners**]{.underline}. [They not only **share like interests** but
play a **vital role**]{.underline} [in **projecting American
interest**]{.underline} [abroad]{.underline}. Take for example how the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([**[NATO]{.underline}**)
**[broadened its]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[collective defense
[commitment]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to include]{.mark} provisions for
"[cyber]{.mark}]{.underline} attacks" in 2014, or how the United States
and Japan similarly broadened their mutual defense commitment in 2019.
Here's what the United States and like-minded partners should do next:

Reinforce existing norms: Like-minded partners should introduce
enforcement procedures for nations that don't abide by existing norms.
They should affirm that there are consequences for bad behavior in
cyberspace. Some possible examples of enforcement include facilitating
robust information-sharing to thwart other nations' wrongful cyber acts
and developing defensive and offensive joint cyber operations. Nations
that don't follow the rules must know that they will be held
accountable.

**[Develop new norms]{.underline}**: [Like-minded [partners
should]{.mark} also **[develop new norms]{.mark},**]{.underline}
[especially [where]{.mark}]{.underline} [OEWG or GGE **[consensus is
unlikely]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Some possible [[examples]{.mark} of
norm-building [include]{.mark} the [right to]{.mark} respond to wrongful
cyber acts in **[self-defense]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the application
of international humanitarian law in armed conflicts involving
cyberspace. The progress on norms must be wrapped into both OEWG and GGE
talks [to **push consensus**]{.underline} [in the **right
direction**]{.underline}.

[Norm-building on cyberspace **remains controversial**]{.underline}.
[[Some]{.mark} will [say]{.mark} that [working with]{.mark} like-minded
[partners]{.mark} **[undermines U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations
[processes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[existing norms are a **clear indication**]{.underline} [that
[these]{.mark} processes **protect the United States' interests** and
[make cyber]{.mark}space **[safer]{.mark} for all
nations**]{.underline}. [The OEWG or GGE [talks **will not
reach**]{.mark} **[consensus]{.mark} anytime [soon]{.mark}**, therefore
the United States should **press ahead** with like-minded partners all
the **sooner**]{.underline}.

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [needs to]{.mark} **step up and
[lead]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [It needs to engage like-minded
partners. It needs to reinforce existing norms and develop new ones to
affirm that there are consequences for bad behavior in cyberspace. The
United States [can't **risk**]{.mark} the possibility of
[**adversaries** at the **forefront of
norm-building**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is an opportunity for
American leadership to make cyberspace safer for all nations.

**form**]{.underline}]{.mark} (defense spending
[[levels]{.underline}]{.mark}), [[of burden-sharing debates]{.mark}.
This highlights the problem that [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[cannot]{.mark} just **[buy interoperability]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[as [it requires]{.mark} **[enhanced]{.mark} cooperation and
[coordination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although interoperability is
considered the alliance's core business, it has not been systematically
treated in the burden-sharing debate. In addition, burden-sharing that
includes the mutual-aid dimension would further refine the cash,
capabilities, contributions --- or "three C's" --- framework regularly
mentioned by the current NATO secretary-general.

[The [current]{.mark} [defense spending narrative]{.mark} is thus a
symptom of **empty formalism** in NATO that [reflects a **lack of
clarity about the alliance's purpose**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and favors
statistical deceptions over effectively implementing the **mutual
commitment** to defend each other.]{.underline} A February 2020 poll by
the Pew Research Center revealed a worrying trend: While NATO is
generally seen in a positive light across publics within the alliance (a
median of 53 percent view NATO positively, though with double-digit
percentage point declines in Germany and France over the past 10 years),
many in 16 surveyed NATO countries seem reluctant to fulfill Article V
collective defense obligations. A median of 50 percent across 16 NATO
member countries is against their country defending an ally, while only
38 percent express willingness to come to help a fellow ally.

Future Defense Spending in Peril right, especially in the context of the
short- and long-term consequences of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
While the scope of the economic impact is still unclear, it is likely to
reshuffle financial priorities in NATO countries. Defense ministries
will find it more difficult to reach the 2 percent spending level by
2024 or even to maintain the current defense expenditures programs.
Moreover, with economies put to halt and eventual drops in national GDP,
even if countries fulfill the 2 percent pledge, they could end up
spending less in real terms. If NATO members continue to frame fairness
in terms of the 2 percent defense spending target, it will further
aggravate the burden-sharing problem, seriously test NATO solidarity,
and ultimately endanger the alliance's ability to adapt to the
increasingly unpredictable security environment and the changing nature
of security threats.

[That assumption led to a [treaty]{.mark} **hopelessly
[lopsided]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in **Russia's
favor**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Consider this: It did not require Russia
to eliminate a single warhead. Instead, it allowed Russia to increase
its countable nuclear warheads, even as it made the United States
continue to draw down.

[Proponents of New START argue that the treaty's [verification
provisions]{.mark} provide]{.underline} an important element of
[transparency]{.underline} between two countries. There is a grain of
truth to that --- [the provisions increase transparency, but they have
little to do with **verification**. In f]{.underline}act, [they [make it
hard to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[detect]{.underline}**]{.mark} [Russia's
**potential [noncompliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

For example, [New START [does not provide a basis to **learn**]{.mark}
**[how many warheads]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[Russia deploys on]{.mark}
each of]{.underline} its intercontinental ballistic missiles
(**[[ICBMs]{.underline}]{.mark}**). The Obama administration negotiated
away telemetry provisions that would allow us to get an insight into
this important characteristic.

Moreover, [[warheads]{.mark} in **maintenance facilities**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [systems **[away from a base]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[are]{.underline} **[off-limits]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[inspectors]{.underline}]{.mark}**, further diminishing our
understanding of the composition of Russia's nuclear forces.
[Inexplicably, the treaty also allows **concealment activities** on
**ICBM bases**.]{.underline}

[These]{.underline} **[lackluster verification provisions]{.underline}**
[mean that **[even if Russia cheated]{.mark}** on New START,
[it]{.mark}]{.underline} [[would be]{.mark} almost [**impossible** for
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to **find out**]{.mark} about
it]{.underline} and then charge Russia with violating the treaty. [And
Moscow has a **long record** of **disregarding treaty
obligations**.]{.underline}

Indeed, [[Russia]{.mark} has [cheated on]{.mark}]{.underline} almost
[**[every arms control agreement it has ever
signed]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Its blatant deployments of
intermediate-range ballistic missiles led to the demise of the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Russia killed a British
citizen and poisoned three others by using a chemical weapon, despite
having ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention.

[The notion that Moscow was no longer a national security headache was
**naive** in 2010]{.underline}. After all, Russiahad invaded Georgia in
2008 and had never ceased making nuclear threats against U.S. allies.

[Today, that notion is **even more far-fetched**]{.underline}, what
[with Russia's **[occupation of Crimea]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [its
ongoing **military [aggression]{.mark}** [in Ukraine and]{.mark}
its]{.underline} destabilizing [**[adventurism in
Syria]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

**[[Forget about a Russian "reset]{.mark}."]{.underline}** The era of a
great power competition is back, and [Russia is serious about
winning]{.underline}. [Its nuclear forces are about 80 % modernized now
and will be pretty close to 100 % modernized by next year]{.underline},
according to Gen. John Hyten, commander of U.S. Strategic Command.

Moreover, [Russia is building new nuclear weapons outside of the New
START]{.underline}: a new ICBM capable of carrying multiple nuclear
warheads, a nuclear cruise missile, and an autonomous nuclear-armed
underwater torpedo. **[The relevance of New START decreases every
day]{.underline}**.

Perhaps [[New START]{.mark}'s greatest flaw, however, is that it
[left]{.mark} Russia's **[tactical nuclear weapons]{.mark}**
**[unscathed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It's a huge problem, because Russia
has at least a 10:1 advantage in this class of weapons. To make matters
worse, Russia seems keen on adopting and exercising strategies that
envision using tactical nuclear weapons first in conventional conflict
--- as a way to communicate resolve and make the United States back
down.

### AT: Hotlines\-\--2AC

#### Hotlines don't solve conflict\-\--Russia will suspend their use in conflict

Hananh **Levintova 17**, reporter at Mother Jones, 4/7/17, \"Russia
Threatened to Shut Down the "Deconfliction" Hotline. Here's Why That's
Terrifying.\", Mother Jones,
https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/04/deconfliction-hotline-syria-trump-russia/

[**[Following the US attack on a Syrian airbase]{.mark}**]{.underline}
overnight, [[**Russian officials** expressed
**outrage**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russia, which is allied with Syrian
dictator Bashar al-Assad, denounced the missile strikes as a "violation
of the norms of international law." [Russia also [took an]{.mark} even
more [**ominous step**,]{.mark} announcing that [it would be **shutting
down the "deconfliction" hotline**]{.mark} it shares [with the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates.]{.underline}

The deconfliction hotline may sound obscure, but it's actually [a key
channel through which the two countries communicate about their military
activities]{.underline} in Syria. The US and Russia are backing
different sides in Syria's civil war; the US and its allies are
attacking ISIS (and now Assad), while Russia is attacking Syrian rebels.
[[This creates the potential for an **unintended incident**]{.mark}
between US and Russian forces [to **escalate**]{.mark} into a larger
conflict between the two powers.]{.underline} The hotline helps prevent
that from happening by allowing both sides to coordinate their planes in
Syria's crowded airspace, avoiding collisions.

**[Defining Security Cooperation]{.underline}**28

[[Security Cooperation is a]{.underline}]{.mark} Department of Defense
(**[[DOD]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[term]{.mark} that refers to \"\...all
DOD interactions with foreign defense establishments to]{.underline}:

• [Build defense relationships]{.underline} that promote specific U.S.
security interests;

• [Develop allied and friendly military capabilities]{.underline} for
self-defense and coalition operations, including allied transformation;

• [Improve information exchange and intelligence sharing]{.underline} to
harmonize views on security challenges; [and]{.underline}

• [Provide]{.underline} U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency
access and [en route infrastructure]{.underline}.\"29

[[**Security Cooperation** is **not**]{.mark} **the same** as
[**Security Assistance**. The latter]{.mark}]{.underline} term [[refers
**only** to]{.mark} programs such as]{.underline} Foreign Military
Financing (**[[FMF]{.underline}]{.mark}**), Foreign Military Sales
(**[[FMS]{.underline}]{.mark}**), the International Military Education
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Training Program
(**[[IMET]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [and other programs governed by the
**F**]{.underline}oreign **[A]{.underline}**ssistance
**[A]{.underline}**ct [and [managed by]{.mark} the
**[D]{.mark}**]{.underline}efense **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ecurity
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ooperation
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**gency. [[The
**D**]{.underline}]{.mark}epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate [plays a key role in [providing]{.mark}
**policy [direction]{.mark}** [for **Security Assistance**]{.mark}
**programs**. [Security Cooperation is]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[much
[broader]{.mark}]{.underline}** term that, [[**in addition to Security
Assistance**, includes]{.underline}]{.mark} such categories of
activities as [**combined [exercises]{.mark}**, **combined
[training]{.mark}**, **combined [education]{.mark}**,
**military-to-military [contacts]{.mark}**, **humanitarian
[assistance]{.mark}**[, and **info**]{.mark}**rmation
operations**]{.underline}.30 [It also refers to the **planning process**
DOD organizations use to implement these activities]{.underline}.

In essence, the Security Cooperation planning process is a systematic
method for translating strategic guidance into programmatic objectives.
The Office of the Secretary of Defense issues annual Security
Cooperation Guidance (OSD SCG) to guide the planning and activities of
Unified and Specified Commands, the military services, and other DOD
agencies and actors.31 The SCG promulgates strategic objectives based on
security themes derived from the National Security and Defense
strategies. It also provides regional and country priorities,
objectives, and measures of effectiveness for assessment.32 The Unified
and Specified Commands, the services, and other DOD players develop
subordinate plans to execute Security Cooperation activities in support
of OSD\'s objectives. The Unified Commands, for example, develop
regional strategies and country plans to guide the implementation of
security cooperation activities in their Areas of Operation.33

It is an oft-repeated mantra that in order to defeat transnational
terrorism, and by extension other related non-state threats, the United
States must apply all the elements of national power, including
diplomatic, informational, military, and economic.34 [The [OSD SCG
directs]{.mark}]{.underline} that [**DOD [Security Cooperation]{.mark}**
[\"will be **integrated** with **other elements of**]{.mark} **national
[power]{.mark}**]{.underline}.. .in order [[to
achieve]{.underline}]{.mark} national security, defense, and foreign
policy [[objectives]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"35 This formulation, while
helpful, obscures two key facts. First, [Security Cooperation includes
activities that]{.underline} by their very nature [involve]{.underline}
the simultaneous application of [more than one element of national
power]{.underline}. Security Cooperation at a minimum requires the
combination of diplomatic relations, military assistance,
military-to-military contacts, and public diplomacy. In other words,
Security Cooperation is itself an application of at least three of the
classic elements of national power.36 Second, [[DOD is **not** the
**only entity**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the USG [that interacts with
foreign governments to achieve the stated objectives]{.underline}:
relationships, capabilities, information and intelligence, and access.
The **[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate, the [**[Intelligence]{.mark}
Community**, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} to a lesser extent,
[**[other]{.mark} departments and [agencies]{.mark}**, conduct
activities aimed at the [accomplish]{.mark}ment of **these
[objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}, broadly understood. [[There
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, **[[no common]{.underline}]{.mark}**
USG, or **[[interagency, definition]{.underline}]{.mark}** or concept
[[of Security Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}.37 We will return to this
issue in the final section of this paper. For the purposes of the
present discussion, [[this paper offers the following]{.mark} **working
[definition]{.mark}** of Security Cooperation:]{.underline}

> [[Security Cooperation refers to **all**]{.mark} **USG
> [assistance]{.mark}** [provided to **foreign**]{.mark} **law
> enforcement, security, and defense [establishments]{.mark}** [in
> **support of**]{.mark} **national defense, security, and foreign
> policy [objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}.38

#### [PREDICTABILITY]{.underline}\-\--DOD definition is [arbitrary]{.underline}.

Albert **Zaccor 5**, Colonel in the US Army and Atlantic Council Senior
Fellow, August 2005, "Security Cooperation and Non-State Threats: A Call
for an Integrated Strategy,"
https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/46290/2005_08_Security_Cooperation_and_Non-State_Threats.pdf

Part III of [[this paper offered a **definition** of Security
Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} that could be [[**common** to the
**entire US**]{.underline}]{.mark}G, [**[not just]{.mark}** the
**[D]{.mark}**]{.underline}epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense. [[The **US**]{.mark}**G
interagency** [has **no**]{.mark} **such [common definition]{.mark}**
because it lacks a **common conceptual understanding**]{.underline} of
how to translate higher level strategic guidance into specific programs
designed to accomplish strategic objectives.

The Department of Defense, despite its size, its diversity, and the
scope of its Security Cooperation activities, has such a common
understanding. DOD\'s process is not without its flaws.113 During the
late 1990s and the early 21st century, however, the department has
successfully established a rational set of procedures for translating
the strategic guidance in the National Security, Military, and, now,
Defense Strategies, into specific programs executed by the military
commands, services, and defense agencies.114 This process promotes
discipline by forcing subordinate organizations to demonstrate that
their Security Cooperation activities directly support specific
objectives in the higher-level strategies. Efforts are under way to
discipline the process further by establishing an assessment mechanism
to provide feedback on the effectiveness of programs and activities.115
One reason for the success of the DoD program is oSD\'s publication of
periodic Security Cooperation Guidance. This document, in addition to
providing authority for subordinate organizations\' Security Cooperation
activities (see more below), serves the purpose of an informal doctrine,
stipulating not only the \"what,\" but the \"how\" and the \"why\" of
Security Cooperation.116

In order for the USG interagency to plan and execute Security
Cooperation programs and activities in an integrated and synergistic
manner, a doctrine, or common conceptual framework, for Security
Cooperation is necessary. Such a doctrine would have to define what
Security Cooperation is, and, what it is not.117 It would have to define
precisely which departmental and agency programs qualify as Security
Cooperation and outline a procedure for combined interagency planning,
programming, and execution. Armed with such a common conceptual
framework, executive branch officials and program managers will be
better equipped to engage in integrated planning and program execution.
True success in this effort, however, will depend on the resolution of
the other problems of authority, funding, and process and organization.

\[Footnote 117\]

As has been suggested here, [[activities to improve **foreign**]{.mark}
**partners\' security [capabilities]{.mark}** [conducted by
**any**]{.mark} **department or [agency]{.mark}** [would qualify as
Security Cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}. In contrast, [general foreign
development assistance]{.underline}, although related to security and
part of broader U.S. foreign policy, [would probably not]{.underline}.
Even within DOD, this is not totally clear. Officials in OSD\'s
Counter-proliferation Policy office refused to admit that activities
intended to improve the maritime security capabilities of Azerbaijan and
Kazakhstan in support of counter-proliferation would be included under
the definition of Security Cooperation and declined to integrate their
program formally with other DOD Security Cooperation efforts.

#### [AFF GROUND]{.underline}\-\--limiting the AFF to the DOD eliminates [core affs]{.underline} like arms sales, training, and information sharing which require the guidance and resources of [other agencies]{.underline}. 

#### [NEG GROUND]{.underline}\-\--affs [still include]{.underline} the DOD, granting the neg the DOD PIC [and]{.underline} trade-off DA, and including [other actors]{.underline} gives the neg more PIC and DA ground. 

#### [GRAMMAR]{.underline}\-\--the resolution says, "The [USFG]{.underline} should..." the USFG [isn't only]{.underline} the DOD.

#### [REASONABILITY]{.underline}\-\--good is good enough.

Over the past decade, [Allies have identified a steep increase in cyber
activities targeting the critical infrastructure sectors that NATO
military operations rely upon.]{.underline} Directly or indirectly,
[these malicious cyber activities [can]{.mark} also [disrupt]{.mark} the

geographic domains [[came]{.underline}]{.mark}, thus, [[as a **direct
recognition** of]{.mark} cyber as [a]{.mark} hybrid [threat to]{.mark}
both the Allies and [the Alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Compared to the air, land and sea domains, the cyber domain is not
constrained by national borders (although certain physical aspects of it
might be located within them). This distinction between the cyber and
the geographic domains is important to note, because NATO was founded in
response to external military threats without the right to intervene in
internal security matters, where member states maintain the monopoly
over the use of force. In the cyber domain, the distinction between
internal and external security threats is harder to ascertain. When
integrating offensive cyber capabilities into its defence and deterrence
mandate, NATO would inevitably tackle certain aspects inherent to
internal security; and yet, not legally infringe on the sovereignty of
the Allies as long as effects amounting to force or intervention are not
employed against the physical systems residing in these nations.6
[[Operating]{.mark} in the cyber domain [requires]{.mark}]{.underline},
thus, [that [member states **better integrate**]{.mark} their
**[offensive cyber]{.mark}** capabilities into NATO operations not just
to win future wars, but also [to **avoid**]{.mark} elements of
[**friction** between Allies]{.mark}, which may arise [from
**unilateral**]{.mark} cyber **[effects]{.mark}** to defend critical

NATO's adversaries in the cyber domain

[Warfare in the cyber domain is already conducted against NATO member
states by both state and nonstate actors. It is also conducted by NATO
member states against these external threats. [Within the
Alliance]{.mark}, however, [offensive cyber]{.mark} effects are [**not

**[integration]{.mark}** of national offensive cyber capabilities [into

and [the Alliance [**recognizes** that **cyber-attacks**]{.mark} (as

ones]{.underline}. This is [[because]{.mark} malicious cyber activities
against [computers that control physical processes]{.mark} can be as
dangerous as threats that are purely physical]{.underline} in nature and
[[could lead to **explosions**, **nuclear meltdowns**,

capabilities specifically [for the **purpose** of **using them against
NATO**]{.mark} member states]{.underline}.7 In [Russia's]{.underline}
case, [cyber attacks were conducted]{.underline} against the critical
infrastructure of NATO member states and partner nations, as for example
[against US energy infrastructure in 2017 (including against a nuclear
powerplant]{.underline} near Burlington, Kansas)8 or against the Ukraine
power grid in December 2015. [China has also been conducting persistent
cyber espionage using offensive cyber capabilities against core military
and critical infrastructure of NATO member states for
years.]{.underline} For this reason, the US Secretary of Defense, Mark
T. Esper, remarked at the 2020 Munich Security Conference that [the 5G
Huawei infrastructure is a serious threat to NATO]{.underline}.9 Lastly,
[Iran's offensive cyber capabilities have also been observed during
multiple attacks against the critical infrastructure of NATO partner
nations in the Middle East]{.underline}.

### Overview\-\--2NC

#### Allied OCOs are inevitable

http://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1441

[At]{.underline} [the 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, [**cyberspace** was
**recognized** as an operational domain]{.mark} in which NATO military
forces must be able to maneuver]{.underline} as
[effectively]{.underline} as they do on land, at sea and in the air.
[Since then, [**Allies** have conducted **several successful**
**o**]{.mark}ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
**[o]{.mark}**peration**[s]{.mark}**1 against non-state adversaries,
such as Daesh]{.underline}. Due to technological transformations in
recent years, [cyber]{.underline} [is]{.underline} no longer [viewed by
NATO]{.underline} and its member states only as a hybrid threat, but
also [as a weapon]{.underline} in its own right [and]{.underline} as a
[force multiplier]{.underline}2 [in current military operations. [Over
the next two decades, NATO will **look for new ways** to
integrate]{.mark} cyber weapons (or **[offensive cyber]{.mark}**
capabilities) [into]{.mark} its operations and
**[missions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.3

#### The only question is if they're unilateral or collectively integrated\-\--unilateral OCOs cause cyber fratricide

[The **[lack of integrated offensive cyber A2/AD]{.mark}** capabilities
[undermines]{.mark} both the [**unity of the Alliance** and]{.mark} its
mandate of defence and **[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On the
former, [the lack of coordination between Allies during **[unilateral
cyber op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** could [lead to
**friction**]{.mark} when resulting effects [infringe on Allied]{.mark}
cyber-physical [infrastructures]{.mark}. It could also lead to [**cyber
fratricide**, when failure to properly attribute Allied]{.mark} digital
[personas occurs]{.mark} during these military operations.]{.underline}
On the latter, [while most [Allies]{.mark} are developing offensive
cyber capabilities, some [remain **unable** to face]{.mark} the growing
number of [cyber threats **unilaterally**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[In the latest signal [**NATO** is adopting a **tougher posture**
against cyber]{.mark} and electronic [attacks]{.mark},]{.underline}
Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg]{.underline} this week
[said]{.underline} that [the defensive alliance will not remain purely
defensive]{.underline}.

Stoltenberg told attendees at the Cyber Defence Pledge conference in
London, ["**[We are not limited]{.mark}** to respond in cyberspace when
we are attacked in cyberspace."]{.underline}

[NATO [members]{.mark} have [**already "agreed** to integrate]{.mark}
national cyber capabilities or **[o]{.mark}**ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
into Alliance **[o]{.mark}**peration**[s]{.mark}** and

cyber [attack against one]{.mark} member nation [could trigger]{.mark}
an Article 5 collective [response by all]{.mark} members]{.underline}.
Yet only once has a collective response ever been invoked, at the
request of the United States following the attacks of September 11,
2001. [NATO is a defensive organization, so what an offensive cyber
posture looks like remains something of a mystery. An Article 5 response
can take many different forms.]{.underline}

[That's the strength of the article]{.underline}, according to NATO
Deputy General Secretary Rose Gottemoeller. [However]{.underline}, while
[an Article 5 response]{.underline} can be unpredictable, it [must be
coordinated, which can be tricky with many different partners in
possession of many different capabilities]{.underline}.

At an event in May, Gottemoeller said [[NATO]{.mark} was in the
processes of establishing a new innovation board [to "**bring together
all**]{.mark} of the **[parts]{.mark}** of and pieces of NATO that have
to wrestle with these new technologies to really try to get a flow of
information]{.underline}. Many of you having served in any international
institution or government, you know how things can get stove-piped. So
[we are [resolved to **break down**]{.mark}]{.underline} those
**[[stove-pipes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly where innovation is
concerned," she said.

#### US limitation shapes strategy

Getting More Aggressive on Offensive Cyber\", Defense One,
https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/05/nato-getting-more-aggressive-offensive-cyber/157270/

[[NATO]{.mark} is building a **[cyber command]{.mark}** that is
scheduled to be fully [operational in **2023**]{.mark} and [will
coordinate]{.mark} and conduct [all **o**]{.mark}ffensive
**[c]{.mark}**yber **[o]{.mark}**peration[**s**.]{.mark} **[Until then,
whatever NATO does offensively]{.mark}**, it [will **rely**]{.mark}
heavily [on]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates and the
**[discretion]{.mark}** of U.S. commanders]{.underline}, according to
Sophie Arts, program coordinator for security and defense at the German
Marshall Fund, who explains in this December report.

"Yesterday's remarks indicate that [NATO's [leadership is
**thinking**]{.mark} more [**seriously** about]{.mark} buttressing the
alliance's deterrence posture in **[cyber]{.mark}**space and address
**[threats]{.mark}** that fall [under]{.mark} the threshold of an
**[Article 5]{.mark}** violation]{.underline}," she told Defense One.

["This tracks recent shifts in strategy adopted by several NATO allies,
including the United States, which integrate offensive cyber operations
as an important tool [to proactively address]{.mark} growing instances
of cyber [interference]{.mark} from hostile actors."]{.underline}

**[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** Arts points out [[there is **no**]{.mark}
field [**manual** for coordinating]{.mark} cyber offensive
**[op]{.mark}**eration[**s** among]{.mark} individual
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, including big players in cyber like
Estonia, the U.K. and the United States, who keep command and control
over their assets.

In 2017, Gregory Edwards, then director of infrastructure services at
NATO's communication and information agency laid out what that might
look like. "You could make a case-by-case decision" about responding to
attacks, he said. ["[You **need**]{.mark} to have [**a policy** that
says, '**if our operation is disturbed, we will take**]{.mark} a
specific **[action]{.mark}**.' The action will be listed. It will be
listed what things the commander is allowed to do in that regard. It
will be a specific action."]{.underline}

[NATO Cyber Rapid Reaction teams are already equipped to conduct

Washington University School of Business, "NATO's needed offensive cyber
capabilities", NDC Policy Brief, No. 10, May 2020,
http://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1441

Speaking at the Cyber Defence Pledge Conference in London in May 2019,
NATO Secretary General highlighted that [[for **deterrence** to have
**full effect**]{.mark} against state and non-state adversaries,
[NATO]{.mark} and its member states [must be ready to use the **full
range of capabilities**]{.mark} at their disposal, [to include]{.mark}
national **[offensive cyber]{.mark}** capabilities]{.underline}.
Deterrence is the act of diminishing an adversary's intent by
highlighting the excessive costs for the said adversary if it proceeds
with an undesired action. [In NATO's case, deterrence is achieved by
highlighting to an adversary the excessive costs delivered through
military means in the event of an attack against Allies. For deterrence
to be successful, [the adversary **must believe**]{.mark} that [NATO is
**ready and willing** to impose]{.mark} these [**excessive costs across
all operational domains**, to include]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} domain.
[This may call for Allies to **develop offensive cyber**]{.mark}
capabilities and integrate them with NATO operations in order [to
**collectively impose** a **high**]{.mark} enough [**cost** to **deter
adversaries** from **aggressive behaviour**]{.mark}. To avoid escalation
to total war and cyber fratricide during the fog of war, Allies must
also agree on a list of Flexible Deterrent Options]{.underline} meant to
allow for a gradual increase of pressure in the cyber domain, and then
hopefully limiting the scope and intensity of conflict in this domain.
[NATO Flexible Deterrent Options in the cyber domain could
include]{.underline} (as presented in Figure 1):

#### It\'s [effectively deterring]{.underline} major cyberattacks now, but the plan [derails]{.underline} it

Peter **Ramjug 22**, Journalist at Northeastern University, \"Russia
Hasn't Launched a Massive Cyberattack on Ukraine Yet. Why Not?,"
Northeastern University, 3/7/22,
<https://news.northeastern.edu/2022/03/07/ukraine-russia-cyberattack/>

More than a week into war and [Russia]{.underline} **[has
yet]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [**unleash a paralyzing, large-scale
computer network attack on Ukraine**. U.S. banks are
**bracing**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} retaliatory
**[cyberstrikes]{.underline}** [that have]{.underline} **[yet to
materialize]{.underline}**. Even Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine's
president, continues to post videos.

[What]{.underline} has **[happened]{.underline}** [to
Moscow's]{.underline} much-heralded [cyber-warfare]{.underline}
capabilities**[?]{.underline}**

For starters, "[they're]{.underline} **[not as
sophisticated]{.underline}** [as]{.underline} many [people make them out
to be]{.underline}," says Northeastern's David Wesley, who teaches
graduate-level courses in global strategy and culture in the
D'Amore-McKim School of Business. "[It's actually the
**West**]{.underline} that is [crippling the **Russian**]{.underline}
computer [systems]{.underline}."

[Microsoft, in]{.underline} the span of [just]{.underline} a few
**[hours]{.underline}**, detected and **[thwarted]{.underline}**
[a]{.underline} **[data-wiping attack]{.underline}** on Ukraine's
network days after the war started. [American enterprise rushing to the
rescue in times of war was reminiscent of how]{.underline}
**[Ford]{.underline}** quickly [pivoted]{.underline} its assembly lines
[during]{.underline} **[World War II]{.underline}** to build tanks,
jeeps, and airplanes.

[Russia may also be]{.underline} **[reluctant]{.underline}** [to start a
cyberwar for fear of]{.underline} **[getting attacked
back]{.underline}**, adds Luis Dau, associate professor of international
business and strategy.

"They don't want a war on two fronts if they don't have to," he says.
"[They're finding the war on Ukraine]{.underline} **[harder than they
were expecting]{.underline}**."

**[Western]{.underline}** [governments and companies---and the Ukrainian
government itself---have]{.underline} **[beefed up their]{.underline}**
computer **[defenses]{.underline}** since 2017, when a sinister
ransomware program known as NotPetya infiltrated the servers of Maersk,
the Danish cargo-shipping giant. The program destroyed servers and
computers around the globe.

Had it not been for a lone company server in the African nation of Ghana
that lost power and thus wasn't connected to the rest of the network,
the situation could have been much worse. "That's what saved Maersk but
it was by accident," says Wesley.

"Instead of \$300 million, it would have been billions of dollars in
damage," he adds.

Two years later, in August 2019, Ukrainian officials launched the new
Ministry of Digital Transformation, which is working on
cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and offensive hacking capabilities.

"We are creating an IT army," the ministry's 31-year-old leader tweeted
over the weekend. It directed cyber devotees to a Telegram
channel---"itarmyofurraine"---that instructed followers on how to
disable Russian websites. Russia's largest stock exchange as well as a
government-owned bank and the Russian Foreign Ministry were taken
offline after being targeted by Ukrainian hackers.

Ukrainian ministry officials have also been working with the Anonymous
hacking collective to take down Russian sites.

"If you go to almost any Russian website, they're offline," says
Northeastern's Wesley. "So [the threat against]{.underline}
**[Russia]{.underline}** [of cyberattacks is]{.underline} **[much
higher]{.underline}** now [than]{.underline} it is [against
us]{.underline}." But, he warns, "that doesn't mean the threat isn't
there. It's still really serious."

Periodic web outages have been reported in Ukraine since hostilities
began, but nothing approaching the size and devastation of the Maersk
attack, one of the worst cyber breaches ever. Maersk employees
reportedly noticed "Ooops your files are encrypted" messages appearing
on their laptops before screens systematically went black one-by-one
company-wide.

Wesley, Dau, and Alexandra Roth, an executive professor of international
business and strategy at Northeastern, authored a case study to be used
in international strategy courses to teach students about responding to
global threats such as cyber warfare and regional disputes.

The June 2017 Maersk incident was likely collateral damage from an
attack on Ukraine, which "has long been a testing ground for Russia's
cyber capabilities, and it was no coincidence it all started on the
Ukrainian Independence Day," Roth says.

**[Most]{.underline}** computer [network attacks]{.underline}, they say,
[have the]{.underline} **[greatest]{.underline}** [impact
on]{.underline} **[antiquated operating systems]{.underline}** such as
the one Maersk was using. At a minimum, companies should have a broad
approach that includes regular upgrades and patches.

Ignoring those steps could be costly.

[**Maersk** executives]{.underline} were focused on issues such as
inflation, trade, and fluctuating energy prices, but
"**[failed]{.underline}** [to recognize that a cyberattack
posed]{.underline} a far greater **[threat]{.underline}** on its
critical infrastructure," the professors wrote in the case study.

[The]{.underline} U.S. **[banking system]{.underline}** **[wouldn't make
the same mistake]{.underline}**.

[It has been guarding its networks for **years**]{.underline}, investing
massive sums on technology and people to build a wall around its most
important data.

Even with those precautions, big institutions such as JP Morgan,
Citigroup, and Bank of America have seen a wave of recent cyberattacks
that they describe as a subtle but intensified assault, the New York
Post reported. The attacks have ramped up since the U.S. imposed
sanctions against Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.

But it's not the big banks that have to worry about a Russian-fueled
security breach, say Northeastern professors. It's the smaller regional
banks, credit unions, and hospitals.

"It's an existential crisis for these smaller organizations," Wesley
says. "The larger ones are much better protected."

Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire founder of Tesla and
SpaceX, has been outspoken about the invasion of Ukraine. He has come to
Ukraine's defense by shipping Starlink satellite internet stations to
keep communications lines open.

Musk warned that Russian forces could still target the terminals.

"Starlink is the only non-Russian communications system still working in
some parts of Ukraine," Musk tweeted, "so probability of being targeted
is high. Please use with caution."

That goes back to the Northeastern professors' beliefs that the combined
efforts of Western technology makes Russia no match for the West.

"[Our capabilities are **much stronger than many**]{.underline} people
**[believe]{.underline}**," says Wesley.

[The **big question**]{.underline} [now surrounding a digital
attack]{.underline} on Ukraine [revolves around **NATO's Article
5**]{.underline}, which is [based on a collective defense mindset if one
country is targeted]{.underline}, says Roth.

"So [if a critical infrastructure gets hurt and if it causes physical
damage similar to a conventional kinetic attack, then **this is pretty
clear that NATO will step in,**]{.underline}" she says, something that
may make Moscow think twice. [Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but
several of its **neighbors** are.]{.underline}

[For all their power and results, however, **[cyber]{.mark}**space
**[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** are not silver bullets, and [to be
**most effective**]{.mark}, they [require]{.mark} much
**[planning]{.mark}** and preparation. [Cyber
Command]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[works closely with other]{.mark}
combatant [commands to **integrate**]{.mark} the planning of kinetic and
nonkinetic effects. Cyber Command's capabilities are meant to
**[complement]{.mark}**, not replace, [other]{.mark} military
**[capabilities]{.mark}**, as well as the **[tools]{.mark}** of
diplomacy, sanctions, and law enforcement.]{.underline} And they are
often used [[in **coop**]{.mark}eration [with **foreign military
partners**, who bring different skills]{.mark} and techniques to the
table. [The West's **united front**]{.mark} against the Soviet Union
kept the Cold War cold; likewise, today, the United States and its

[promote respect for]{.mark} widely held international
**[norms]{.mark}** in cyberspace.]{.underline}

### Link Wall\-\--AT: Resiliency Turn

#### OCOs are better than declaratory policies at incentivizing build-up of resiliency 

John **Carlin 18**, former assistant attorney general for the National
Security Division at the Justice Department where he did lead the
investigation on the Sony attack, currently chairs Morrison And
Foerster's global risk and crisis management team, interviewed by James
A. Lewis, Director and Senior Fellow, Strategic Technologies Program,
Center for Strategic and International Studies, 3/19/18, \"Responding to
Russia: Deterring Russian Cyber and Grey Zone Activities\", CSIS,
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/responding-russia-deterring-russian-cyber-and-grey-zone-activities>

MR. CARLIN: And I don't want to underestimate that it's important to
have [[a **declaratory** policy]{.underline}.]{.mark} But I would firmly
agree with Jim. [[**We had one**. We declared it]{.mark}. We've declared
it now [**multiple times** in the context of **specific actions**, and
then **not acted**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [that has]{.underline} a --
[[the **inverse**]{.mark} effect [of **encouraging future
action**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So I think [[**less time right now** on
**figuring out the exact words** of a]{.mark} go-forward [declaratory
policy, and **more focus**]{.mark} on **[putting points on the
board]{.mark}** and **[executing]{.mark}** a [**response** to]{.mark}
the [actions that have **already taken place** in violation of]{.mark}
numerous [statements]{.mark} from two administrations]{.underline} that
really agreed on very little -- very little else.

#### The best defense is a good offense

Approach\", Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-08-25/cybersecurity

This doctrine of [persistent engagement reflects the fact that
**[one-off]{.mark}** cyber **[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** [are
**unlikely to defeat adversaries**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Instead,
[[U.S.]{.mark} forces [must **compete**]{.mark} with adversaries [on a
**recurring** basis]{.mark}, making it far more difficult for them to
advance their goals over time.]{.underline} For example, [publicly
releasing adversary malware obtained during **[hunt forward
missions]{.mark}** to the cybersecurity community [makes]{.mark} that
malware less effective because **[defenses]{.mark}** can be [tuned to
**detect** and **defeat**]{.mark} it.]{.underline} Additionally, [cyber
effects operations allow Cyber Command to disrupt and
**[degrade]{.mark}** the **[capabilities]{.mark}** our [adversaries
use]{.mark} to conduct attacks.]{.underline}

#### Resiliency takes too long

Jim **Miller et al 18**, president of Adaptive Strategies, member of the
Defense Science Board at the Atlantic Council, previously co-chaired the
Task Force of Cyber Deterrence, being interviewed by James A. Lewis,
Director and Senior Fellow, Strategic Technologies Program, Center for
Strategic and International Studies, 3/19/18, \"Responding to Russia:
Deterring Russian Cyber and Grey Zone Activities\", CSIS,
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/responding-russia-deterring-russian-cyber-and-grey-zone-activities>

MR. LEWIS: No, I think you need to split it into two parts. And so
[[on]{.mark} the **[resilience]{.mark}** side]{.underline}, I'm a little
gloomier, in that I don't -- [[**ten years** is]{.mark} probably an
**[optimistic]{.mark}** estimate]{.underline}. So I do think -- so I
used to make fun of **[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and I still
do at some levels, but I think you [[have to convince]{.mark} potential
[attackers]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and we have four -- [that the
[risk]{.mark} of doing something to U.S. critical infrastructure [is
outweighed by]{.mark} the [cost]{.mark}]{.underline}. And that's part of
what we're talking about today, is how do we identify costs that could
apply to people?

On the social media side, I think there's this question of what does
intermediation look like? What does the ability to impose new standards
on the new media look like? And, you know, some people have said, well,
Facebook needs to go out and hire 3,000 editors. They probably don't
need to do that, but how do we encourage people to begin to identify the
false information. That's probably something you can do with technology.
But how do we do it in a way that's respectful of freedom of speech? And
so it's a very intentionally complicated issue, because no U.S.
government agency has the authority to go and say: This is -- this is
fake news. This is false. So it's something that we'll have to either
change the laws or find incentives for the companies.

MR. LEDGETT: I do think that there's a role for the government in terms
of helping identify the provenance of a story and helping to identify --
you know, the first time this story appeared was in this place, to our
knowledge. And so that's input to a process that I agree the government
can't run. But I think that -- and, John, you would be the expert on
this. But I think that, you know, they could add a paragraph to the
39-paragraph end user license agreement that nobody reads that says:
Hey, we are going to exercise our judgement and we're going to flag, you
know, things that we believe are suspicious or don't look factual. And
you agree to let us do that.

MR. LEWIS: How would you break -- how would you avoid a tit for tat
cycle? What would you do to -- this is not going to be a one-move game,
right? So we've experienced things. I think we all agree we should do
something back. And I'm fairly confident that other side will not say,
OK, we give up. So we are going to get into an iterative process here.
How do we control that? And I don't know if escalation dominance is the
right way to think about it. That's a nice nod to Herman Kahn. But what
is it we do to get out of the cycle of just tit for tat? And you've seen
this in -- certainly in some of the terrorist cases, certainly in the
Israeli experience. It doesn't do you any good to get into response -- a
counter-response cycle.

MR. MILLER: I agree with that. And [it's true within
cyberspace]{.underline}. It's because, as was noted earlier, we are more
vulnerable than Russia in cyberspace. That does not necessarily need to
be the case forever. I do think [[10 years is]{.mark} probably on the
[optimistic]{.mark} side [for **hardening**, **but**]{.mark} it's
**[not]{.mark}** the optimistic side for **[increasing]{.mark}** our
**[offensive capability]{.mark}**, which is]{.underline} -- which is,
I'll say, [non-trivial]{.underline}, even today. One of the challenges
we need to just have in the foremost of our mind as we think about
U.S.-Russia tit for tat is that the high end of the escalation ladder is
thermonuclear war, right? And so taking steps to show that we have
limited aims, even though we're responding strongly, keeping open
channels of communication, taking note of fire breaks.

### Impact\-\--Terror

#### Terror scenario

Ion A. **Iftimie 20**, Eisenhower PhD Candidate Fellow, NATO Defense
College, and Senior Advisor, European Union Research Center, George
Washington University School of Business, "NATO's needed offensive cyber
capabilities", NDC Policy Brief, No. 10, May 2020,
http://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1441

[NATO adversaries in the cyber domain also include non-state actors,
such as terrorist organizations. The US]{.underline} and the UK have
[conducted several successful **[o]{.mark}**ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
**[o]{.mark}**peration**[s]{.mark}** against those entities. These
offensive cyber operations had [a]{.mark} significant **[force
multiplier]{.mark}** effect, in conjunction with conventional
actions]{.underline} on the ground, at sea, in the air and from space,
[[that contributed to]{.mark} the **[defeat of Daesh]{.mark}** in both
Iraq and Syria]{.underline}.10 Today, [most Allies are building
[offensive cyber]{.mark} capabilities [needed to **deny**]{.mark}
adversaries the **[freedom of maneuver]{.mark}** in the cyber
domain.]{.underline}

The use of area denial weapon systems in the cyber domain

Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) weapon systems have traditionally been
used by NATO and its member states to prevent an adversary's freedom of
maneuver on land, sea or air. In the geographic domains, these
capabilities include land mines, missiles (cruise, ballistic, surface to
air, anti-ship, etc.), submarines, electronic warfare, and even
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE)
weapons. [In the **[cyber]{.mark}** domain [**A2/AD** is achieved
through]{.mark} **[o]{.mark}**ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
**[o]{.mark}**peration**[s]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Those operations have already been used]{.underline} for the purpose of
achieving A2/AD by NATO member states in the cyber domain. This is the
case of [the US-led Operation Glowing Symphony (OGS), where "the United
States Cyber Command reportedly acquired administrator passwords to
\[Daesh\] websites. The passwords enabled **[deletion of digital
content]{.mark}**, including videos used for recruitment]{.underline},
from cyber infrastructure located in at least five countries outside
actively hostile areas of Iraq and Syria. Similar digital content
reportedly resided on cyber infrastructure in as many as 30 other
States. [**[Changing]{.mark}** the **[passwords]{.mark}** reportedly
locked IS administrators out of the websites".]{.underline}11 [OGS
restricted Daesh's freedom of maneuver on networks physically residing
in Iraq and Syria (which were controlled by the terrorist group), but
also worldwide, where a NATO member state (the US) achieved
**[d]{.mark}**enial **[o]{.mark}**f **[s]{.mark}**ervice effects against
Daesh.]{.underline}

[OGS [disrupted]{.mark} Daesh **[propaganda]{.mark}** through content
removal from servers residing in multiple countries and through
restricting access to physical [**infrastructure** needed to store
digital data]{.mark}. Combined with operational successes against ISIL
on the ground, OGS actions resulted in propaganda efforts being
significantly reduced]{.underline} on several global social media
platforms, including Twitter. [One particular offensive cyber operation
acted, ipso facto, as [an A2/AD platform]{.mark} where a NATO member
state [restricted access to]{.mark} physical [networks **critical** for
Daesh **recruitment**, **training**, **radicalization**,
**fundraising**, and **c**]{.mark}ommand **[and]{.mark}**
**[c]{.mark}**ontrol.]{.underline}

[[NATO's]{.mark} publicly declared [policy on cyber]{.mark} threats [is

#### Ambiguity [deters]{.underline} aggression by introducing [uncertainty]{.underline} into adversary's calculus\-\--clarity causes [provocations]{.underline} that go [nuclear]{.underline}

Cyber Threat", The National Interest, 7/2/2010,

That seems reasonable enough and is certainly a matter that deserves
discussion within [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, I have it on good
authority, it's in fact being discussed frequently. But, while it makes
sense for the allies to draw up contingency plans and reinforce their
cooperation and capabilities in this burgeoning arena, we [[should
**stop short** of **formally declaring** what]{.mark} **precise set of
[circumstances]{.mark}** would [allow Article 5]{.mark} to be
invoked]{.underline}.

[First, doing so would **put the members in a bind**. A cyber attack
might technically meet the theoretical definition put forth in advance
without the actual circumstances generating consensus for any number of
reasons]{.underline}. Perhaps the aggrieved party will be perceived to
have provoked the attack by belligerence---belligerence that would
actually be encouraged by an a priori declaration of support.

Or perhaps the risks of retaliation simply outweigh the damage done by
the attack because of complicating circumstances. This is hardly
unthinkable given that the most probable nation-state aggressors are
Russia and China.

Regardless, [the allies would then be forced to choose between the
credibility of NATO and their own short-term interests]{.underline}.
It's an untenable position far more likely to harm the alliance and its
members than to ward off the cyber threat.

Second, [[there's **tremendous value** in **strategic
ambiguity**]{.mark}. This was commonly understood during the Cold
War]{.underline}, when the United States refused to declare that it
would not engage in first use of nuclear weapons. [While our leaders
almost certainly had no intention of launching a first strike, they knew
that **[declaring]{.mark} this [formally]{.mark}** would [make]{.mark} a
[**conventional attack**---which]{.mark} could be expected to
[**escalate** to]{.mark} a **[nuclear war]{.mark}**---**more
[likely]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In the cyber case, [drawing [a **bright line**]{.mark} for potential
adversaries virtually **[invites actions just short]{.mark}** of casus
belli. [By instead]{.mark} simply declaring that there may be
circumstances in which NATO will consider a cyber attack on one of its
members an attack on all---but **[not spelling out]{.mark}** what those
[circumstances]{.mark} may be---those contemplating such an
[attack]{.mark} will [have]{.mark} an **[additional risk]{.mark}
factor** [to **deter**]{.mark} them]{.underline}.

[The **N**]{.underline}orth **[A]{.underline}**tlantic
**[C]{.underline}**ouncil [should simply come to an understanding that
the charter's]{.underline} 1947 [language]{.underline} requiring an
"armed attack" to invoke collective defense [is dated and that
[**flexibility** is needed]{.mark} for emerging threats. Plus, they
should agree to **increase cooperation** in this arena and
**streamline** the process by which **consultation** under Article 4 can
take place]{.underline}.

#### It [also]{.underline} causes future [overreaction]{.underline}\-\--NATO will be [forced]{.underline} into [conflict]{.underline} when adversaries go beyond

"Cyber War: The Next Frontier for NATO", Calhoun: The NPS Institutional

Finally, [[NATO needs to **maintain ambiguity** on]{.mark} what
justifies an [Article 5 response]{.mark}]{.underline}. As mentioned
previously, [[ambiguity]{.mark} has **[served]{.mark} NATO
[well]{.mark}**[. A **set threshold** for when]{.mark} NATO [will
invoke]{.mark} an Article 5 response [to]{.mark} a [cyber]{.mark}-attack
on a member country [is **not necessary**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
ambiguity has historically served the alliance well, as demonstrated by
the 9/11 attacks. If the alliance had said weapons were only include
guns, bullets, tanks, and bombs, it would have set a threshold
precluding a NATO response to attacks that turned four planes into
improvised missiles. The larger issue of ambiguity is that there is no
set definition of what constitutes an armed attack and what
circumstances dictate a collective response, as per Article 5.
[[Remaining ambiguous]{.mark} on the severity threshold of a
cyber-attack [allows]{.mark} the [alliance to act]{.mark} in cases of
future cyber-attacks that cause severe damage, [but also]{.mark} allow
NATO [to **refrain from over-reacting**, **even if**]{.mark} an [event
is]{.mark} a **[cyber]{.mark}**, or kinetic, attack [**as per a
definition**. It would be a **mistake** to set a threshold for attacks
that **cannot**]{.mark} **currently [be
anticipated]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### The plan accelerates Russian [cyber probing]{.underline}\-\--adversaries will [test redlines]{.underline} and [circumvent]{.underline} escalation thresholds

[**[NATO]{.underline}** [needs to be careful about
**defining**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and **signaling its
[redlines]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Making]{.underline}]{.mark} [these
boundaries **[too specific]{.mark}**]{.underline} [could]{.underline}
[**[embolden adversaries]{.underline}** [to
intensify]{.underline}]{.mark} [their [actions below]{.mark} NATO's
declared **[threshold]{.mark} of response**]{.underline}.
[[Being]{.underline} **[deliberately ambiguous]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[and [raising]{.mark} the **[fear of retribution]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[may be]{.underline} **[more useful]{.underline}** [for
[encouraging adversaries']{.mark}]{.underline}
self-**[[restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

At the same time, [NATO should aim to deter specific types of
particularly threatening unconventional activities]{.underline}. These
include major and sophisticated cyber attacks against allies' military
forces and critical military and civilian infrastructure, proxy military
and special forces operations, and state-sponsored terrorism. NATO could
declare that such activities may lead it to invoke Article 5 and respond
in various ways, including asymmetrically (for example, the response to
a cyber attack may not involve only cyber capabilities).

The alliance must be able to identify early whether and when
unconventional and hybrid gray-zone actions have become a more
substantial and coordinated campaign. In such a case, NATO should aim to
deter the adversary from escalating further. This requires increasing
the alliance's capacity to share early-warning intelligence and pool
national intelligence-gathering, investigation, and attribution
capabilities. NATO should not shy away from attributing ongoing
operations to state adversaries, relying on national data as needed. The
alliance and its members should be prepared to use direct channels of
communication and other means to deliver immediate deterrence signaling
in specific cases.

[On the Southern flank, [**NATO** faces]{.mark} state]{.underline}
[actors that use [unconventional **tactics**]{.mark} and]{.underline}
**[proxy forces]{.underline}** (for example, Iran and Syria); [state
collapse and the emergence of ungoverned spaces in
**Libya**]{.underline}, **[Yemen]{.underline}**, [and parts of the
Sahel]{.underline}; and the activities of a range of nonstate actors,
[from loose groups to **terrorist** and criminal networks]{.underline}
to highly organized quasi-state structures like Hezbollah.
**[[Coop]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration [with regional partners in
addressing these threats [will be **vital**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark} [primary]{.underline}
[[task]{.underline}]{.mark}, as elsewhere, [[should be to
**deter**]{.mark} **states** in the region from]{.underline} [using
**[unconventional tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against **NATO** and
its allies]{.underline}, [[using **signaling**]{.mark} and
**attribution** tools]{.underline}. When possible, the alliance should
aim to affect the calculus of nonstate actors to prevent them from
harming alliance interests. This may not work with jihadist groups but
may be possible with actors motivated by political or economic
interests.

### Redlines Bad\-\--Russian SOI Impact

#### Russian cyber probes produce a European SOI

David **Takacs 17**, Associate Fellow at Slovak Security Policy
Institute. \"Ukraine's deterrence failure: Lessons for the Baltic
States.\" DOI 10.1515/jobs-2017-0001

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and its **[[revisionist]{.mark}
behaviour]{.underline}** [[present]{.mark} the **[Baltic
S]{.mark}**tates [with]{.mark} a multitude of
**[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [making deterrence a]{.underline}
]{.mark}**[top [priority]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Baltic Region.
[Not only does [Moscow wish to extend its]{.mark} **[s]{.mark}phere
[o]{.mark}f [i]{.mark}nfluence**]{.underline} to include what it
describes as 'near abroad', [it must carefully protect its own model of
'**sovereign democracy'**]{.underline} at home. Prior to Russian
involvement, Ukraine was getting close to signing an association
agreement with the European Union (EU) and it was feared that
'democratic change in brotherly Ukraine could spread to Russia'.
[Transforming Ukraine to a western democracy was seen as a
**threat**]{.underline} [to the Russian regime and was thus stymied at
its source]{.underline} (Snegovaya, 2014). However, the Baltic States
have already been fully integrated into NATO and the (EU) and have been
stable democracies for over two decades now. So what is the nature of
the threat that Russia presents to the Baltic States?

[Putin is using **[hybrid tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as a means of
achieving his objectives of a **politically [restructure]{.mark}d
[Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These include]{.underline} massive
[pro-Russian **[propaganda]{.mark}**]{.underline} and misinformation
campaigns, using **[economic levers]{.underline}**,
[**[intimidation]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
employment of **[cyber]{.mark} war**]{.underline}f[are]{.underline}
elements. [In Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014, [Russia]{.underline} has
once again [demonstrated its resolve to use both military and
non-military means]{.underline} to create and fuel conflicts in pursuit
of its wider geopolitical interests. The Kremlin is busily trying to
regain its sphere of influence over nations that were formerly part of
the Soviet Union, and the Baltic States' governments are continuously
being reminded to stay alert. In addition, **[NATO frontier
allies]{.underline}** [face much more **significant
threats**]{.underline} [due to their proximity to the potential
**aggressor**]{.underline} (Grygiel and Mitchell, 2016, p. 166). [Thus,
what **[NATO needs]{.mark} most** to deter Russia is ['to
demonstrate]{.mark} **robust political [solidarity]{.mark}**[']{.mark}
within the alliance]{.underline} (NATO Parliamentary Assembly Report,
2015, pp. 4-6). [There has been a significant]{.underline}
**[increase]{.underline}** [in Russian **[probing]{.mark}** activities
to [gauge]{.mark} NATO's **[commitment]{.mark}** to the Baltic States
over the past two years]{.underline}. Grygiel and Mitchell (2016, p. 43)
define Russian probing as a 'lowmintensity and low-risk test aimed at
gauging the opposing state´s power and will to maintain security and
influence over a region'. In case of the Baltic States, [probing is
aimed at the]{.underline} **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and the
strongest European countries, their power and their [will to back
up]{.mark} their most **exposed [allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As
mentioned by Grygiel and Mitchell (2016, p. 122), '[there is a strong
correlation between the **existence** of **alliances** in a given region
and the **effectiveness of deterrence**]{.underline} against a
threatening power'. [Building on the **allies' fear of abandonment** and
**US fear of entrapment** in local **conflicts**, [Russia is aiming to
**hinder**]{.mark} **their [relations]{.mark}hips** [which]{.mark} could
ultimately [provide Moscow]{.mark} with more [room for
**probing**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[manoeuvring]{.underline}** [in the Baltic Region]{.underline}.

Hybrid or conventional?

#### Global war

Dr. Hal **Brands 18**, Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished Professor of
Global Affairs at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies, Charles Edel, Senior Fellow and Visiting Scholar at the U.S.
Studies Centre at the University of Sydney and is the author of Nation
Builder: John Quincy Adams and the Grand Strategy of the Republic, The
Disharmony of the Spheres,
https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/hal-brands/the-disharmony-of-the-spheres/

To see this, just work backward from the present. During the Cold War, a
bipolar balance did help avert actual war between Moscow and Washington.
But even in Europe---where the spheres of influence were best
defined---there were continual tensions and crises as Moscow tested the
Western bloc. And outside Europe, violence and proxy wars were common as
the superpowers competed to extend their reach into the Third World. In
the 1930s, the [emergence of **[German]{.mark}** and [**Japanese**
**spheres**]{.mark}]{.underline} of influence [[led to]{.mark} the
**most [catastrophic war]{.mark} in** global **history**]{.underline}.
The [empires of the **19th
century**]{.underline}---[spheres]{.underline} of influence [in their
own right]{.underline}---[continually **jostled**]{.underline} one
another, [leading to **wars**]{.underline} and near-wars over the course
of decades; the Peace of Amiens between England and Napoleonic France
lasted a mere 14 months. And looking back to the ancient world, there
were not one, but [**three** **Punic Wars** fought between Rome and
Carthage as two expanding empires came into conflict. A world defined by
**[s]{.mark}**pheres **[o]{.mark}**f **[i]{.mark}**nfluence [is]{.mark}
often a world [**characterized** by **tensions**, **wars**, and
competition]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The reasons for this are simple. As the political scientist William
Wohlforth observed, unipolar systems---such as the U.S.-dominated
post--Cold War order---are anchored by a hegemonic power that can act
decisively to maintain the peace. In a unipolar system, Wohlforth
writes, there are few incentives for revisionist powers to incur the
"focused enmity" of the leading state. Truly multipolar systems, by
contrast, have often been volatile. When the major powers are more
evenly matched, there is a greater temptation to aggression by those who
seek to change the existing order of things. And seek to change things
they undoubtedly will.

The idea that spheres of influence are stabilizing holds only if one
assumes that the major powers are motivated only by insecurity and that
concessions to the revisionists will therefore lead to peace. Churchill
described this as the idea that if one "feeds the crocodile enough, the
crocodile will eat him last."

Unfortunately, today's rising or resurgent powers are also
motivated---as is America---by honor, ambition, and the timeless desire
to make their international habitats reflect their own interests and
ideals. It is a risky gamble indeed, then, to think that **[[ceding
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** or **[China]{.underline}** an uncontested
sphere of influence [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} turn a revisionist
authoritarian regime into a satisfied power. The result, as Robert Kagan
has noted, might be to **[[embolden]{.underline}]{.mark}** those actors
all the more, by [giving them **freer rein** to bring]{.underline} their
[**near-abroads under control**, **greater latitude** and **resources**
to **[pursue]{.mark}**]{.underline} their [**[ambitions]{.mark}**, and
**[enhanced confidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[the
**U.S**]{.mark}**.-led [order is fracturing]{.mark}** at its
**foundations**. For **China**, dominance over the **first island
chain** might simply **intensify** desires to achieve **primacy** in the
**second**]{.underline} island chain and beyond; [for **Russia**,
**renewed mastery** in the **former Soviet space** could lead to desires
to [bring]{.mark} parts of the former [Warsaw Pact to heel]{.mark}, as
well.]{.underline} To observe how China is developing ever longer-range
anti-access/area denial capabilities, or how Russia has been projecting
military power ever farther afield, is to see this process in action.

The **[[reemergence]{.underline}]{.mark}** of a spheres-of-influence
world [would]{.underline} thus **[[undercut]{.underline}]{.mark}** one
of the great historical achievements of U.S. foreign policy: the
creation of a system in which America is the dominant power in each
major geopolitical region and can act decisively to shape events and
protect its interests. [It would foster an environment in which
**[democratic values]{.mark}** are **less prominent**, **authoritarian**
models are **ascendant**, and mercantilism advances as **economic
[openness recedes]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And rather than leading to
multipolar stability, this change could simply [[encourage]{.mark}
**greater [revisionism]{.mark}** on the part of powers whose **appetite
grows** with]{.underline} the **[eating]{.underline}**. This would lead
the world away from the relative stability of the post--Cold War era and
back into the darker environment it seemed to have relegated to history
a quarter-century ago. The phrase "spheres of influence" may sound
vaguely theoretical and benign, but its real-world effects are likely to
be tangible and pernicious.

Fortunately, the [return of a **s**pheres-**o**f-**i**nfluence **world**
is not yet inevitable]{.underline}. Even as some nations will accept
incorporation into a Chinese or Russian sphere of influence as the price
of avoiding conflict, or maintaining access to critical markets and
resources, others will resist because they see their own well-being as
dependent on the preservation of the world order that Washington has
long worked to create. The Philippines and Cambodia seem increasingly to
fall into the former group; Poland and Japan, among many others, make up
the latter. The [**[willingness]{.mark}** of even this **latter group**
[to]{.mark} take actions that [risk]{.mark} **incurring
[Beijing]{.mark}** [and **Moscow's wrath**]{.mark}]{.underline},
however, [[will be]{.mark} **constantly [calibrated]{.mark}**
[against]{.mark} an [**assessment** of **America's**]{.mark} own
[**ability** to]{.mark} **continue [lead]{.mark}**]{.underline}ing [the
**resistance** to a **s**pheres-**o**f-**i**nfluence
**world**.]{.underline} Averting that outcome is becoming steadily
harder, as the relative power and ambition of America's authoritarian
rivals rise and U.S. leadership seems to falter.

### Redlines Bad\-\--AT: Deterrence Fails

#### Deterrence works and stops attacks before they happen

\*\* IRA == l'Internet Research Agency de Saint Petersburg

Questioned in march 2018 during his confirmation hearing at the senate
about the reprisals that adversaries of the United States can fear after
attacks, cyber or informational, [general [Nakasone]{.mark} clearly put
forward that adversaries do not fear eventual reprisal]{.underline} (the
deterrent effort would be insufficient or ineffective). [To overcome
this]{.underline}, [he [officially applies a concept inherited from the
American special forces "**forward defense**]{.mark}]{.underline}," put
in the open in the war on terror, and [[that consists in carrying
out]{.mark} preventative [actions]{.mark} in being [**permanently
present** in foreign computer systems]{.mark}.]{.underline} It should be
clear that **[one must be prepared for offense]{.underline}** [to make
defense]{.underline} of national territory [effective]{.underline}.

Today, [the Cyber Command endowed with new prerogatives by the
Executive]{.underline} (in National Memorandum 13, still confidential)
and by Congress [would carry out **preventative cyber operations**
targeted on strategic foreign sites]{.underline} (Russian, in priority).
These would not be the subject to the prior approval of the white house,
which allows an augmented speed of response. [[The objective of
these]{.underline}]{.mark} (disconnecting the IRA, carrying out an
intrusion into the Russian GRU), made responsible for DNCleaks, carry
out threatening targeted messaging campaigns against officials or
foreign military) [[would be to **dissuade all states** considered
threatening to]{.mark} democracy and [America]{.mark}n national
security]{.underline}. For some people observers, [it would be a
question of [practicing a \"cyber cold war\" by **using
everything**]{.mark} the [available]{.mark} cyber and informational
\"deterrence\" arsenal.]{.underline}

And this, all the more so as with the proliferation of hybrid conflicts
in Europe such as in Asia, many middle powers allied with the United
States are under attack cyber, Russian or Chinese, which target their
defense infrastructures. These attacks often support other forms of
threats, operating in the \"gray zone\". This is the case since 2012,
for the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam or Taiwan, which with conflicts
over maritime borders facing China, suffer provocations Chinese in their
territorial waters, doubled by cyber attacks on their civil and military
infrastructures facing which they found themselves destitute. These
vulnerabilities led them to seek help from the American partner to be
able to train their own cyber units10 . For the United States[, the
affirmation of [an offensive cyber posture may be seen by]{.mark} its
[allies as an]{.mark} attempt to **[maintain a comparative
advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the cyber space as its status as
hegemon is put in question.

Thus, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} American [[intrusion carried out
against Russian electricity]{.mark} infrastructure]{.underline}s in June
2019 [[was]{.mark} publicly presented as a way [to **prevent a
blackout**]{.mark}]{.underline} (massive power cuts) **[[in]{.mark} some
[pivotal American states]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [during
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [campaign [presidential election]{.mark} of
2020]{.underline}.11 For those responsible for US cyber offensive
operations, [[the challenge now is to digitally infiltrate]{.mark}
[hostile systems even **before they can attack**]{.mark} national
territory[. The objective is also to make believe in a **balance of
power**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to **increase
deterrence**]{.underline}]{.mark} [as in the days of the
nuclear]{.underline} age. For as much, the [idea is to avoid for all
actors any damage reaching targets civilians]{.underline} (such as
hospitals) to avoid escalation.

Resilience as methodology: NATO's strategic aim

[**Resilience** is a method]{.underline}. A dedication to the goal. It
is therefore an aim. Terminologically is announced in security-led
strategies yet also business-led strategies. It holds a completely sound
operational aim. To deliver and stick to the requested. [It is brand
name that defines strategy through which it results to operational
capacity that sustains and grows; [at]{.mark} the level of
[NATO]{.mark}, with the capacity to apply in diverse fields of
operations adding value, to [an **already robust** **policy
decision**]{.mark} and operational **[capacity]{.mark}** building and
actions; at the level [of **cyber-security policy resilience**]{.mark}
to the framework [is a "strong-hold" policy to deliver]{.mark} a
**[protection]{.mark}** mechanism and method.]{.underline}

[Resilience's framework acknowledges the will for **preparedness** so as
to counter]{.underline} a possible integrative part of possible
[emerging crises]{.underline}. It is seen as [an innovative strategic
management policy procedure and tool.]{.underline} Strategically, it
applies to operational capacity building, both civil and military. It is
an element of acknowledged standardization of procedures. [In the
defense sector, when forces are deployed, they need **flexible** and
effective means of countering threats; while in the field of
cyber-security, they need **agility** in operational network centric
**op**eration**s**, and constant accurate flow of
**info**rmation.]{.underline}

[Strategic resilience in cyber-security requires flexible adaptability
to new challenges]{.underline}. [Its **strategic resilience** works as a
tool for closeness, mitigation, and/or **negotiation**; it
[allows]{.mark} for **[coop]{.mark}**eration [among]{.mark} allies or
[members]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[NATO's vigilance and resilience in security-led affairs including
cyber-security [defines]{.mark} strategic **[plans]{.mark}** and
re-assesses **risks** that will [allow us to think **entrepreneurial**
and **innovative**]{.mark}. For NATO members]{.underline}, Heads of
State, and Governments, [cyber-security creates a modern administrative
and operational format and framework of the alliance at a virtual level
that is flexible and e-oriented, [reflective to]{.mark} the **[market
needs]{.mark}** for security and stability, while [augmenting]{.mark}
market **[e-innovation]{.mark}** and while [adapting]{.mark} to [**new
affordable methods**]{.mark} of **economic** and socio-economic
**growth**. NATO acquires protection mechanisms [while]{.mark} its
**[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** and memberships
**[enlarge]{.mark}** while operational [challenges are]{.mark} upgraded
and **[updated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. NATO needs to provide militarily
and technologically agile and interoperable forces with added value,
through civilian capabilities (NATO's Cyber-Defense Policy, 2011).

[Resilience in security-led affairs through innovation and
entrepreneurship therefore should be [a **leveled adaptation
process**]{.mark} for NATO; a phase to consequently strategize and draw
new scenarios for cyber-security]{.underline} among others. [This comes
through operational result processes of **training** and
**experiences**, when countered in an effective manner [with
**lessons**]{.mark} to be [**learned**]{.mark} constantly [in
**adaptable** new circumstances]{.mark} against any forms of
cyber-attacks.]{.underline}

[Resilience becomes thus a policy orientation for NATO's **["Smart
Defense"]{.mark}** clause.]{.underline} [NATO
[boosts]{.mark}]{.underline} on **[[military
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [methods of operational
support]{.underline} and deliverables [and protection mechanisms, while
remaining relevant as a political military organization]{.underline}, a
regional and global asset value to security and strategy application at
a time of vast changes and challenges.

#### The plan undermines our tech edge 

Camille **Grand 20**, NATO's Assistant Secretary General for Defence
Investment, Matthew Gillis, Defence Investment Staff Officer at NATO HQ,
\"Alliance capabilities at 70: achieving agility for an uncertain
future\", NDC Policy Brief No. 01, Jan 2020,
<http://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1408>

Secondly, [the pace of change has accelerated at a tempo that risks
outpacing our ability to exploit and, as necessary, counter the
technological advancements on the horizon. Many of these technologies
are driving towards **[faster]{.mark}** and [more **distributed**
decision-making]{.mark}, which in turn [bumps up against]{.mark} the
sometimes [**bureaucratic** and **conservative**]{.mark} nature of
[NATO]{.mark}'s machinery and [**decision making**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**Posturing the Alliance to fully embrace these tech**]{.mark}nologies
**[will require]{.mark}** an adapted mindset and culture of delegating
authority and **[accepting ambiguity.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

One case for improvement is in the area of NATO processes, particularly
those that manage procurements, standardization, and capability life
cycles. [We often strive for perfection in our future requirements, and
engineer our processes around [**numerous decision gates** and
**complicated management structures**]{.mark}. The [result is]{.mark} a
[capability]{.mark} that can be [**over budget**, **late**, and
**obsolete** when delivered. NATO has taken]{.mark} some [healthy
steps]{.mark} in this direction [with]{.mark} the adoption of [a **new
model**]{.mark} for governing common funded capabilities [with fewer
decisions]{.mark} and streamlined oversight. [But **continued efforts
are needed.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Industry also has a substantial role to play in this area. [Our]{.mark}
traditional **[d]{.mark}**efence **[i]{.mark}**ndustrial
**[b]{.mark}**ase [should not be]{.mark} complacent with a business
model that can be slow, cumbersome, and **[risk
averse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In what Klaus Schwab has defined as the
"fourth Industrial Revolution", [the changes on the horizon "herald the
transformation of entire systems of production, management, and
governance"]{.underline}1 [while entirely upending existing industrial
value chains. **The [success of Allies' industries will depend on more
acceptance of risk]{.mark}**, greater investment in research and
development, and an adapted mindset towards partnering with players
outside the traditional defence sphere.]{.underline}

#### The impact is great power war

Jim **Talent et al 19**, Senior Fellow, Bipartisan Policy Center, Former
U.S. Senator (R-MO), Robert O. Work, Distinguished Senior Fellow, Center
for a New American Security, Former Deputy Secretary of Defense,
12/3/19, \"The Contest for Innovation: Strengthening America's National
Security Innovation Base in an Era of Strategic Competition\", Report of
the Task Force on 21st-Century National Security Technology and
Workforce, The Ronald Reagan Institute,
https://www.reaganfoundation.org/media/355297/the_contest_for_innovation_report.pdf

[The **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates has entered an era of
long-term [**competition**]{.mark} with **revisionist powers**. A key
aspect of this competition [will revolve around]{.mark} a contest for
**[tech]{.mark}**nological **[superiority]{.mark}** waged
[between]{.mark} the national **innovation bases** of the respective
competitors. [The outcome]{.mark} of this competition [will
determine]{.mark} not just American national security but also how the
nations of the world interact---and [whether a **free and open**]{.mark}
political and economic [**system** will remain]{.mark} the foundation of
those interactions.]{.underline}

After a long post-Cold War focus on rogue regional powers and nearly two
decades of continuous warfare in the Middle East and a focus on rogue
regional powers, [the United States now faces a new defining national
security challenge: a long-term strategic competition with a resurgent
[**Russia** and]{.mark} a rising **[China]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Russia [seeks to reestablish]{.mark} itself as a **[global
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While Russia is able to compete with the
United States militarily in certain domains, its economic outlook and
long-term demographic prospects are grim. Accordingly, it is unlikely to
develop and nurture a true national innovation ecosystem. Given these
disadvantages, [Russia is limited to acting as a **geostrategic
spoiler** seeking [to]{.mark} undermine and [weaken the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates, its **[alliances]{.mark}**, and
its global interests.]{.underline}

China, on the other hand, is already challenging the United States
economically, militarily, and politically. China's economy has surpassed
that of the United States in terms of purchasing power parity and could,
under some scenarios, pass the U.S. GDP in absolute terms in the mid- to
late 2020s. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, China
defines its vital national interests in ways that are irreconcilable
with both the interests of the United States and the values of
self-determination and individual freedom to which we and our allies are
committed. [[China's]{.mark} global expansion, from both a trade and
military perspective, is [challenging the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [in]{.mark} virtually **[every region of the
world.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[In pursuit of its goal of reshaping the world order, China aims to
supplant the **U**nited **S**tates as the world's **leading
tech**nological **power** by 2030. China has articulated a distinct
strategy of statedriven innovation, defined by its concept of
"military--civil fusion," to lead the world in cutting-edge technologies
that might allow it to leapfrog the United States both economically and
militarily.]{.underline}

That strategy presents a two-fold challenge for the United States.
Economically, the challenge is to sustain American prosperity and access
to markets on equal terms with other nations against China's ambition to
control the economic sectors that will determine national primacy in the
decades ahead.

[Militarily, [the]{.mark} fundamental [mission]{.mark} of the U.S.
government (USG) [is to **deter a great-power war** and, if deterrence
fails, to **prevent escalation**]{.mark} of the conflict and end the war
on terms favorable to the United States and its allies. [An important
**key**]{.mark} to this mission [is]{.mark} achieving and maintaining
**[military--tech]{.mark}**nical [**superiority**.]{.mark}
However,]{.underline} over the last several decades,
[China---and]{.underline}, to a lesser extent, [Russia---has invested
heavily in advanced military capabilities specifically aimed at
overcoming the technological lead of America's armed
forces.]{.underline}

[As a result, [the **conventional overmatch**]{.mark} that [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has relied upon]{.mark} to **undergird**
its **deterrence** posture since the end of the Cold War [is
**eroding**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The balance of power in East Asia has
already shifted substantially in China's direction. [[If this]{.mark}
trend [continues]{.mark}, effective [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} in
that region [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[fail, leaving the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [to face]{.mark} the unattractive
alternatives of accepting aggression against its interests or its allies
or triggering **[armed conflict]{.mark}** with the]{.underline} People's
Liberation Army [(PLA), with all the attendant risks of
escalation.]{.underline}

The point of departure for any contemporary analysis of the means and
ends of innovation for national security should be the 2018 National
Defense Strategy (NDS).1 The strategy describes [a complex and dynamic
security environment marked primarily by a renewal of rivalry
[among]{.mark} the **[major powers]{.mark}**]{.underline} and with it
new forms of strategic competition and new forms of strategic conflict.
Among the dynamic elements it highlights is [the technological
dimension: **[strategic competition]{.mark}** with Russia and China [is
characterized by a]{.mark} seemingly [**relentless drive** to
develop]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**new tech**]{.mark}nologies---
[**advanced computing**, **big data**]{.mark} analytics,
**[a]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence, [**autonomy**,
**directed energy**, **hypersonics**,]{.mark} and
**[biotech]{.mark}**nology. **[Multiple simultaneous
tech]{.mark}**nological [**revolutions**]{.mark} are likely to
significantly [impact the **character of war**. The competitor that
**best harnesses**]{.mark} these **[tech]{.mark}**nologies [will have
the **advantage** in]{.mark} fighting and **[winning the wars of the
future]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The NDS exhorts the nation to [foster a
competitive mindset]{.underline} and emphasizes the need [to "out-think,
out-maneuver, out-partner, and out-innovate" our competitors and
potential adversaries.]{.underline}

It is not surprising that the NDS focuses on
**[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** as [a [**key** to **out-competing
adversaries**]{.mark} during a period of rapid technological
change.]{.underline} At the same time, the NDS hints that technological
innovation is a necessary, but not sufficient condition, for
outinnovating the competition. [[As tech]{.mark}nology
[advances]{.mark}, the nation's [military must]{.mark} also seek to
[innovate its **operational concepts**]{.mark} and
**[doctrine]{.mark}**, as well as its
**[organizations]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Each is explored below.

#### Coordinating tech innovation solves all global challenges\-\--saves humanity

Daniel **Araya 20**, PhD, Public Policy, University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, Senior Partner with the World Legal Summit and Senior
Fellow with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, 9/1/20,
\"Is The Venus Project The Next Stage In Human Evolution?\", Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielaraya/2020/09/01/is-the-venus-project-the-next-stage-in-human-evolution/#1d09e43c5c35

[A seismic shift is under way. Against the backdrop of rising
temperatures, collapsing ecosystems, and the threat of species
extinction, technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics
are now moving to transform the global order]{.underline}. Indeed, for
the first time in our history, [we have the tools and technologies to
guide and shape our evolution. But what will this future look
like?]{.underline}

I recently spoke with Roxanne Meadows and Nathanael Dinwiddie of The
Venus Project to better understand their thoughts on the future. As they
explain, the status quo is no longer working. [Climate change, social
inequality, and technological innovation are now disrupting a
market-driven society. [The key to resolving]{.mark} these [global
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}, they suggest, [is rooted in a
[R]{.mark}esource [B]{.mark}ased [E]{.mark}conomy.]{.underline}

The term "Resource Based Economy" was first coined by Jacque Fresco, the
founder of The Venus Project. Fresco believed that [a Resource Based
Economy could support the scientific [integration of]{.mark} automating
technologies ([AI and robotics]{.mark}) and engineering systems in
providing the highest possible living standards]{.underline}. Meadows
and Dinwiddie suggest that [this kind of economy is the next stage in
human evolution.]{.underline} But what do they mean?

1\. What is The Venus Project?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: The Venus Project is a non-profit organization
that presents a new socio-economic model utilizing science and
technology. For the past 40 years, we have maintained a 21-acre research
center in Venus, Florida. We propose [a new scientific
foundation]{.underline} in [[transcending humanity's]{.mark} current
[problems]{.mark} by]{.underline} testing a new social design for
[organizing our society as a global "operating system".]{.underline}

Taken as a whole, the Venus Project fills the egregious gap between the
sciences and the humanities by combining a social philosophy of the
future [with technical knowledge applied at a global scale to solve the
problems of the human condition]{.underline}. Our methodologies are
designed [to realize the full potential of science and technology to
achieve social betterment for all living systems]{.underline}--- without
exception. Our approach to social organization calls for changes in
governance, economics, urban planning, education, human relationships,
language, and values.

2\. We appear to be in the early stages of a massive economic
depression. What is your sense of what is happening politically and
economically right now?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: We are witnessing an unprecedented political
polarization and economic disruption around the world today. The status
quo is no longer working. [Many people are now beginning to understand
how dysfunctional the management of nations, peoples, and resources has
been. Human needs and the needs of our environment are far too complex
to be managed by political means, arbitrary economic direction, or an
elite without the relevant understanding of science and
technology.]{.underline}

Compounding this problem, [nature operates as a closed-loop system, but
we do not. We extract [resources]{.mark} without replenishing them,
accumulate [waste]{.mark} materials without recycling them, and we
pollute our [air, water]{.mark}, and [food]{.mark} crops for the need to
maintain competitive profit margins. There are [many]{.mark} other
[factors converging]{.mark} at once besides the pandemic, all of which
[contribute to]{.mark} the system's [unrest]{.mark}.]{.underline}

3\. Younger generations seem disaffected with Capitalism. Could you
describe your vision of a post-scarcity society?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: The Venus Project recognizes that if we utilize
[a global systems approach as a basis for organizing and managing
resources]{.underline}, we can design a much more humane environment for
all. Our goal is to advance the health and the protection of the
ecosystem, as opposed to the accumulation of wealth, property, and
power. We do not have enough money to fulfill the needs of the world's
people, but we do have enough resources, if wisely managed. Ultimately,
it is not money that people need, but unencumbered access to the
necessities of life and self actualization.

[Accomplishing this is a technical and engineering challenge [requiring
massive coordination]{.mark} by transdisciplinary teams of engineers and
scientists in [managing]{.mark} the Earth's [resources within]{.mark}
its [carrying capacity]{.mark}. This kind of scientific endeavor [would
eliminate]{.mark} the vicious [rivalries over]{.mark} scarce
[resources]{.mark} and, in turn, generate very different behavior
amongst people.]{.underline}

Briefly, this is what Jacque Fresco, founder of The Venus Project,
termed a "Resource Based Economy". [This is a necessary step for
humanity's evolution. It could be thought of as a new science, a science
of Earth Management where, by necessity, all of Earth's resources become
the common heritage of all the world's people.]{.underline}

4\. How does the Venus Project differ from Socialism or Communism?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: Rather than worker revolts and the forcible
overthrow of the system (Communism), or the redistribution of capital
(Socialism), The Venus Project approaches social change as a process of
guided evolution. In our view, [the challenges before us are a matter of
engineering and design]{.underline}. The Venus Project calls for an
experimental analysis of a new social system. This system is unlike any
communist revolution, utopian commune, or coup d'état tried in the past.

In our view, [[the fundamental issue]{.mark} limiting social management
in the past [has been]{.mark} the [lack of]{.mark} an effective
[data-driven methodology for]{.mark} evaluating and [improving the
system]{.mark}'s functioning.]{.underline} Full-scale blanket
application of social policies to vast geographic areas--- be it through
revolution or legislation--- without a means for evaluating their
effectiveness, follows from an approach heavy in ideology but short in
scientific method. The Venus Project calls for iterative prototyping of
cities that we take as the unit of analysis in validating or falsifying
hypotheses. All of this begins with testing a prototype, not a
revolution.

Although Karl Marx did envision a society wherein money, private
property, and social hierarchy were abolished, he could not begin to
imagine how to implement this system at a technical level. In contrast
to Communism, The Venus Project calls for [the total redesign of cities
(transportation, distribution, manufacturing, recycling, infrastructure)
to produce abundance of goods and services.]{.underline} This is
[achieved through automation and optimized infrastructural
efficiency.]{.underline}

5\. What role does technology and automation play in The Venus Project?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: [For the first time in history, we have the tools
and technology to guide and shape our evolution]{.underline}. To
accomplish this, The Venus Project advocates the humane and intelligent
use of technology and the methods of science directed toward the
well-being of all people and the environment which sustains all life.

In our view, technology and automation should be strictly used for
social betterment and to eliminate repetitive, dangerous and monotonous
work. If automation displaces a job, for example, that means all people
would gain more access to the products those machines produce. The
necessities of life are distributed without a fee with the aim of
expanding to all goods and services. Consequently, there is no threat
resulting from technological labor displacement. On the contrary,
[technology and automation have the potential for enhancing the world's
standard of living]{.underline}, enabling people to learn, spend time
with their families, travel, [and confront the new frontier of
challenges in improving the resilience of the system as a
whole.]{.underline}

6\. How do you envision utilizing AI in decision-making?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: [Applying the methods of science and technology
(including AI) to the operation of the world's societies will lead to a
substantially more reliable functioning of support systems than we have
today. Homelessness, [starvation, war, and environment]{.mark}al
degradation [are consequences of]{.mark} today's political and economic
approaches to [decision-making]{.mark}. A [R]{.mark}esource
[B]{.mark}ased [E]{.mark}conomy operates within a unified systems
approach that utilizes the methods of science and AI to arrive at the
most appropriate decisions at any given time]{.underline}. Unlike
today's implementation of technology, this new approach would be
carefully carried out with the utmost human and environmental concern.
[The real-time influx of quantitative and qualitative data [would
provide real-time feedback, enabling humanity to]{.mark} constantly
observe and [continually improve]{.mark} the operation of the system
over time.]{.underline}

7\. What are the future goals of The Venus Project?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: At present, we are focused on formalizing and
systematizing the body of work of The Venus Project's founder, Jacque
Fresco. In an age that is sorely lacking an approach updated to current
knowledge and capability, we enter uncharted territory with the methods
of science to help us through. This is the crucial job that no one has
attempted, until now.

In the short term, we are focused on a systems approach to organize a
holistic understanding of the natural world and human culture. This
involves understanding economics and human social systems in the broader
contexts of Earth processes and ecosystems, and communicating this
understanding through books, videos, the internet, podcasts, transmedia
storytelling, and course curricula.

In the mid-term, we aim to fulfill the [desperate need for]{.underline}
the [strategic coordination of consilience by synthesizing the knowledge
of academia and the know-how of industry. [This network of intelligence
will produce a]{.mark} transdisciplinary research agenda, research
program, and [global theory of change]{.mark}]{.underline}. Constructing
a new planning center will function as a living lab and think tank
devoted to designing the first prototype city.

In the long term, The Venus Project hopes to see the construction of new
prototype cities for the purpose of testing the hypothesis of [a
holistic, technical design-solution for a social system.]{.underline}
Iterations of these prototypes [will form a worldwide network of
cities]{.underline}. The study of these cities will function as [the
basis for a science of Earth management, the models of which guide the
intelligent allocation of resources for the purpose of optimizing
civilization to adapt and evolve in relationship with an Earth
ecology.]{.underline}

There is a lot to consider and we welcome participation in the
development of such a system.

### Overview\-\--Turns Case\-\--NATO/Russia

#### Innovation provides the adaptability NATO needs to meet future strategic challenges

Statecraft in London, ""NATO@70": still adapting after all these years",

No. 08, Jan 2020, http://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1414

[Future adaption: what are the most likely evolutions of the Alliance
looking forward?]{.underline}

[The **complexity** of NATO's future **adaptation** challenge must not
be under-estimated. The [**modernisation** of Russia]{.mark}'s armed
forces [is part of]{.mark} a new form of complex [**strategic coercion**
that employs **systematic pressure** across **5Ds**]{.mark} of
disinformation, destabilisation, disruption, deception and implied
destruction. Moscow's enduring aim is to use the implicit threat of
force [to keep]{.mark} the Western [allies **permanently**]{.mark}
strategically, politically and militarily **[off-balance]{.mark}** and
the threat of overwhelming force [as a form of]{.mark} strategic
**[extortion]{.mark}** racket focused on those at the margins of the
Alliance.]{.underline} As a consequence, future adaptation and the
Alliance concept of deterrence and defence will require an entirely new
and innovative concept of protection and projection.

[The nature of future war must also be seen within the context of the
emerging complex strategic coercion that Russia is pioneering.
**[Tech]{.mark}**nology-**[led]{.mark}** [**cross-domain**
**war**]{.mark}fare [will]{.mark} see the battlespace [become an]{.mark}
integrated [**air**, **sea**, **land**, **space**, **cyber**,]{.mark}
information (including electronic warfare) and knowledge
**[super-domain]{.mark}** for the conduct of operations. Faced with such
threats transatlantic political [**cohesion** and]{.mark} Alliance
military [**interoperability** will be **vital**. The Alliance]{.mark}
and its member states [must be in the **vanguard** of the **Revolution**
in **Military Tech**]{.mark}nology that is [now underway.
**A**]{.mark}rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence, **[quantum]{.mark}**
computing and [**machine-learning**, **nano-tech**]{.mark}nologies,
**[drone]{.mark}** and other semi or fully **[autonomous]{.mark}**
delivery systems [are now appearing in a **battlespace** that stretches
from]{.mark} the depths of [the **oceans to outer-space**, **across all
landmasses**]{.mark}, and within and between changing societies and
communities.]{.underline}

[Adapting NATO to meet the strategic challenges of the twenty-first
century must thus be the priority]{.underline} for "NATO@70". [If not,
[there is a]{.mark} very [**real danger** the Alliance will lack the
**nimbleness**]{.mark} to meet strategic change and technological
developments, [and ultimately **fail**]{.mark} as a
consequence]{.underline}. There is also a danger that [Alliance cohesion
will]{.underline} progressively [fade]{.underline} if such ambitions are
not properly enunciated through a new Strategic Concept that enshrines
at its heart a new form of flexible response. Above all, European words
must be matched by European deeds through further organisational and
internal reform to enable a properly agile and modernised Alliance that
would give meaning to the 360-degree approach and enable the Allies to
strike a balance between technology, capability and affordability

[[**NATO cyber-security policy should never stop transforming**, while
**tech**]{.mark}nology [progresses and threats **expand**]{.mark} to a

Operationally, national and [[**cooperative forces** need to be
**continuously agile**]{.mark} and technologically advanced. In an
asymmetrical world]{.underline}, which is complete [[with
**unforeseen**]{.underline}]{.mark} challenges and [[**threats**, we
need]{.mark} forces with [**flexibility**, **adaptability**]{.mark},
operational and strategic [command structure, based on]{.mark} high
technologically sophisticated **[info]{.mark}**rmation [**"coming
in,"**]{.mark} but also being used [while in training or]{.mark} through
[active op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}.]{.underline}

On a theoretical scale, the current article requests a cyber-security
strategic framework adoption of resilient adaptability and
interoperability policy in the framework of safety and defense. The
article considers that [[understanding]{.mark} the realities of [threats
is **by definition a natural innovation**]{.mark} and [as we move ahead,
we structure and operate]{.mark} a single [strategy]{.mark} on
cyber-security [against a]{.mark} virtual [threat **from wherever it
comes from**]{.mark}. Its [long-term resilience may be **more complex**
as]{.mark} operational [capacity needs to constantly]{.mark} develop and
[adapt]{.mark} into the convergence of societal structures, and methods;
where socio-economic, technological, defense even health, and education
issues are affected.]{.underline}

When theory on cyber-security, resilience, and operational capacity will
be applied [at NATOs level, [it will **enable**]{.mark} allies and
**[members]{.mark}**, jointly, [to create]{.mark} a [true]{.mark} policy
and strategy for **[cyber-security resilience]{.mark}** against hybrid
virtual threats.]{.underline} The methodology on how to is presented
through this current article.

### UQ\-\--Smart Defense\-\--2NC Solves Case

#### The DA is a status quo gradualism counterplan with an external impact of tech dominance

#### Smart Defense solves the case now\-\--it's a defense posture to hybrid threats that uses bottom-up, business-led input to determine how we should respond\-\--but broad Article 5 interpretation is key\-\--it incentivizes tech innovation in order to stay prepared against all hybrid threats

#### Smart Defense solves clarifies NATO's response to hybrid threats\-\--avoids over and under reactions

Associating smart defense with cyber-resilience: "engagement through
policy adaptation"

As fiscal austerity measures are applied and cutbacks are in effect,
according to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, [NATO allies have to
decide on methods to approach NATOs political agenda
decisions]{.underline}. Allies must enhance capacities and capabilities
to implement new and innovative methods of tactical management for the
benefit of security toward the Alliance space (Chicago Council on Global
Affairs, 2012). According to the Atlantic Council, "...The Alliance,
given its new strategic landscape, currently finds itself in, requires a
new strategy. [[NATO's]{.mark} current three core tasks---[collective
defense]{.mark}, crisis management, and cooperative security---are
['tasks']{.mark} but not strategies---they [do not identity]{.mark} the
full spectrum of [ends, ways, and means]{.mark}, and therefore [do not
tell]{.mark} the Alliance and its [members]{.mark} either [what to
do]{.mark} or the risks involved. NATO has been working diligently but
without great clarity or common agreement as to its end
goals]{.underline} (NATO's Cyber-Defense Policy, 2011)".

Heads of States and Governments do listen and observe, but are not keen
in stepping in the extra mile; to therefore consult and call on NATO to
hold Summit meetings, to negotiate or mitigate current issues, and to
elaborate and concentrate more on economic, political, military and
management innovation and efficiency of administrative cooperation in
all policy regulated fields of NATO.

[A strategic framework policy on "[Smart Defense]{.mark}," which is yet
to be achieved by 2020, may render a cheaper cost for the total sharing
of burden by member states, while [attract]{.mark}ing [more]{.mark}
elements or [variables where tech]{.mark}nology [can be used]{.mark} to
minimize costs]{.underline}. Surely, not all members share the same
burden to this day by are reflective to all countries security defenses
when it comes to cyberspace.

While a policy on smart defense lowers overall long-term cost, and if
burden sharing is actually increased but equaled to lower levels of
fiscal sharing, long-term results will show, that in fact, [less cost
will be achieved and [cyber-innovative methods can]{.mark} help
[mitigate]{.mark} possible [costs]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[While cyber-security becomes a core, NATO policy for smart defense and
resilience attracts attention to stake holders. [Through
evolving]{.mark} and [constant communication]{.mark} and marketing
perspectives, social media and workshops, and conferences, cyber-defense
should continue to be promoted and have a clear aim]{.underline}.
Reflecting on the needs for a global element of cyber-security against
current and emerging challenges, exchange of scientific information and
operational processes promote such ideology, where experts from around
the world exchange information and discuss the risk assessments and how
to manage.

Cyber-security then works as a "decree of specialization, which now
requires adaptation if not done so already for each member state",
politically, strategically, tactically, and operationally but also
legally. Cyber-security must and should always be provided as a
methodological tool for operational success of NATO against current and
emerging threats. It is and will always be a tool for a joint framework
of cooperation, globally.

As smart defense is being upgraded and developed, cyber-defense "...not
a conception but a real-politic issue... (Efthymiopoulos, 2008b)",
should remain an element of specialization policy, a key for concrete
strategic engagement of all resilient member states. It will emerge to
become a policy of innovative unity among states (political) yet also
business continuity (strategic orientation) about the future of NATO
(The entrepreneurial and managerial side of things).

[[NATO's]{.mark} strategic [approach post]{.mark} Warsaw and Brussels of
2017 and [2018]{.mark} Summits is estimated to [reflect a]{.mark} much
need [realistic plan of]{.mark} operations and engagement in the field
of [cyber-security]{.mark} and defense. [NATO]{.mark} should continue to
be collective to be a force projector and force protector. It
[should]{.mark} [not limit its role and actions but should allow and
seek out enlarged coop]{.mark}erations tailored to the global and
regional needs [to counter]{.mark} the existing [challenges]{.mark} or
emerging challenges, considering]{.underline} that as aforementioned
[challenges are now borderless.]{.underline}

[Cyber-security and technological progress within NATO are synonymous.
They can therefore be seen as [the core of]{.mark} collaboration on
[smart defense, to be finalized and achieved by 2020]{.mark} standards.
Cyber-security being technologically advanced is]{.underline} [resilient
to changes]{.underline} [and is innovative as a method as it was never
been done before at NATO until the date that it was presented to. It
[does]{.mark} [provide adaptable]{.mark} technological architecture and
[posture]{.mark}]{.underline}, which will be discussed below considering
the opportunities but also challenges. It will provide robust
deliverables with minimum human capital, fiscal but requests technical
deliverables.

### UQ\-\--Smart Defense\-\--AT: UQ Overwhelms

**It\'s going to be finalized this year\-\--but the aff undermines
efficiencies by creating gaps in coverage**

Marios **Efthymiopoulos 19**, PhD from the University of Crete in
Security and Strategic Affairs on NATO issues and NATO-Russia relations,

By 2008, seven Alliance countries according to the Memorandum of
Understanding on the cyber-defense center, supported Estonia to get full
operational capability (Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and
Spain), which lead to an evolution period. By 2016, [NATO [Allies are
expected to]{.mark} discuss further and [finalize the framework]{.mark},
logistics, and operations, elements of cyber-resilience and procedures
on the policies, when considering threats and challenges in a changing
environment. NATO is yet to decide on the resilience policy, as hybrid
warfare is developing, at a time when smart defense of NATO nations are
expected to achieve the goals and aims which are to be seen [by]{.mark}
the year [2020]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The cyber-attacks in Estonia of 2007 are still today the biggest and
most organized electronic attack, with a duration period of several
weeks, provided NATO with a motive and multipurpose task for years to
come. [[NATO's leadership was]{.mark} in fact correct in its judgment
that (1) such an operational center and policy was needed, (2) its
operational center would [constantly]{.mark} be [evaluating]{.mark} and
evaluated, and would research on prospective [evolutions in
tech]{.mark}nology, malware, and cyber-security (3) that NATO requires
resilience when considering the current or future threats and
challenges.]{.underline}

[The inauguration of its Cooperative Cyber-Defense Centre of Excellence
(CCDCOE) in Tallinn Estonia in May 2008, led to a mission, which holds a
clear vision and statement. It is yet to be "politically ratified" and
adopted as a key core policy by Allies. Its raison d'être as stated is
"to enhance the cooperative Cyber-Defence capability of NATO and NATO
nations, thus improving the Alliance's interoperability in the field of
cooperative Cyber-Defence,"]{.underline} therefore [reflecting on the
key core elements to counter hybrid threats and be constantly resilience
to strategic requests and needs]{.underline}. The vision is for the
CCDCOE to become "a specialized and expertise center for NATO in
cooperative cyber-defense" (CCDCOE, Training Catalogue, n.d.).

The domain of the cooperative cyber defense center in the framework of
cooperative security within NATO focuses in the fields of research which
include:

"Legal and policy elements"

Concepts and strategy

Tactical environment

Critical information infrastructure protection (NATO, 2016c)

The Centre's core policy created an outcome of research and
policy-orientation, as already analyzed. It was presented primarily as a
first outcome, then accepted by the Supreme Commander Allied Command
Transformation (SACT), deriving from a request of NATO HQ (Headquarters)
and by the North Atlantic Council (NAC) level. This included Doctrine
and Concept Development, Awareness and Training, Research and
Development Analysis, and Lessons learned and finally Consultation.

[In July 2018 during the Brussels NATO meeting, the Heads of States and
Governments agreed to the opening of [the cyberspace center]{.mark} as
part of the new NATO command structure reform that [provides]{.mark}
more agility and [assurances of]{.mark} operational
[preparedness]{.mark}, while ensuring force command operations and
agility]{.underline} (Efthymiopoulos, 2013). [The agreement includes a
creation of policy and action reflecting key core issues including a
framework policy for the cyberspace operations center of NATO to learn
and coordinate in operations how [to counter emerging
challenges.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Results: NATO innovates with reflection to cyber-security

In terms of cyber-security, the [Centre for Excellence in Tallinn
continues to portray and project NATOs need for a methodological
cyber-resilience policy. [At]{.mark} NATO [Brussels]{.mark} summit,
[cyber-security became operational]{.mark}. Therefore, NATOs
cyber-defense policy and [smart]{.mark} efficient [methods]{.mark} while
also requested for more interoperability agility and security resilience
in the field of cyber-security [becomes a core
policy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The attempt as an idea and method to reach out on cyber-security agility
of forces for operations is not a new one. On February 6th and 7th 2009,
NATO's Science for Peace and Security (SPS) sponsored a workshop. It
foresighted the possibility of cyber-security framework. Something we
commend through this article: a framework strategy for operational and
efficient cyber-security to become a core policy of resilience at NATO.
The 2009 workshop titled "Operational Network Intelligence: Today and
tomorrow" aimed at adaptation knowledge procedures considering the
evolving and fast growing technology. It spoke about innovation and
entrepreneurship. It talked about methodological approaches that may
bring allies together, while bring cooperative sides together in
investment through R&D opportunities.

Its overall purpose therefore was to introduce the possibility of
innovation: "rethink present strategies and identify urgent measures to
be taken in order to minimize the strategic and economic impacts of
cyber-attacks" (NATO, 2009b). This was the level of anticipation at the
time; considering future correlation of smart-defense with the policy of
cyber-defense at its core. In 2019, innovation seems to be a sound but
lone option; a process where through cooperative security and military
and technological entrepreneurship NATO can move forward.

[In 2019, considering the risk assessments on hybrid
threats]{.underline} and challenges (Davis Jr., 2015), [the need for
better civil awareness and readiness, at a time of much needed
cooperative defense, [Allies have to decide for a]{.mark} robust
[long-term]{.mark} planning innovative and [entrepreneurial
strategy]{.mark} for current and future operations of NATO. [Keeping in
mind the need for]{.mark} strong [success]{.mark} in field operations,
including success in and at a multi-dimensional level of operations
[against all threats while making op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} to be
[cost efficient]{.mark} with minimum human casualty
numbers.]{.underline}

[NATO increasingly recognizes that organized [cyber-attacks]{.mark} seek
to [take advantage of "gaps"]{.mark} in the "system social and market
matrix."]{.underline} Therefore, it should be a request from member
states to examine the increasing need for coordination of human factors
related to the issues of electronic warfare, operational network,
intelligence, and cyber-defense, whether for training, scientific
exchange, and or operations (NATO Review, 2015).

NATO is currently using people involved in e-systems, security, IT
engineers, researches, officers dealing with network operations and
operational centres, as well as professional and academics, among others
including military specialists. [[Specialists]{.mark} in the field on
both a strategic and tactical levels [should continue to be
systematically involved]{.mark} at organized levels of research,
sharing, discussion, and exhibition of outcomes, [which will]{.mark} in
turn [enrich]{.mark} the abilities, capabilities, and capacities of
rendering current [smart-defense]{.mark} and cyber-security [as
a]{.mark} key and [successful]{.mark} resilient and collaborative
[defense policy to NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### UQ\-\--Smart Defense\-\--AT: No Smart Defense Now

As previously noted, cyber-security capabilities in a smart and
resilient way is the "operational goal." NATO members prepare well and
also at joint levels. **[[NATO's Smart
Defense]{.underline}]{.mark}**,Footnote1 [a policy framework for
defensive tactical advice and operations, [**used** to be the method
that]{.mark} among others [branded the **need for a cyber-security

[adopted]{.mark}]{.underline} during the Warsaw Summit
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} July [[2016 and
reflective]{.underline}]{.mark} to the July NATO summit [[in 2018,
expects allies to take **continued actions** through **standardized

NATOs]{.mark} respective institutions, centers of excellence, agencies,
and its [new **cyberspace**]{.mark} operations

[What is **[well known]{.mark}** through policy analysis is [that

operational and tactical levels, so as to [operate in]{.mark} and around
**["article and non-article 5

### UQ\-\--Tech Innovation

#### NATO's proving its capable of innovative tech development now

Camille **Grand 20**, NATO's Assistant Secretary General for Defence
Investmen, Matthew Gillis, Defence Investment Staff Officer at NATO HQ,
\"Alliance capabilities at 70: achieving agility for an uncertain
future\", NDC Policy Brief No. 01, Jan 2020,
<http://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1408>

Blueprints for the future?

[The [**future outlook** for **disruptive tech**]{.mark}nology [is
**not**]{.mark} entirely **[negative]{.mark}**. Two [**new initiatives**
show]{.mark} exceptional [promise to invert traditional]{.mark}
capability development [models]{.mark}, while seizing upon the
opportunities offered by new technology. [They demonstrate]{.mark}
vividly [how **NATO adapts.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The first is [the Maritime Unmanned Systems
Initiative]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here, 14 Allies have committed to a
cooperative framework for developing and integrating unmanned systems
into NATO's defence architecture.2 The project is aimed at bringing
autonomy and unmanned capability to bear in support of tedious and
dangerous jobs at sea, including anti-submarine and counter-mine
warfare. Beyond leveraging new technology, the project is also
leveraging a "start up" mindset for agility and lean approaches. The
project has benefi ted from experience drawn from industry, academia,
and government, including Coca Cola and the Pentagon's Defense
Innovation Unit. This model has already paid dividends: less than a year
after the fi rst commitment was taken, the largest-ever exercise of NATO
unmanned underwater, surface and air vehicles took place off Portugal.3

[The second initiative is [the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control
capability]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a novel example of obsolescence
management, NATO leaders have committed to cooperate towards defi ning a
replacement for NATO's AWACS fl eet in anticipation of its retirement
around 2035. The project launched in 2016 with a fundamental
re-evaluation of NATO's future needs, eschewing any assumptions that
AWACS would simply undergo a "likefor-like" replacement. The project has
since arrived at capability requirements that drive for an integration
of surveillance and C2 across multiple domains. Allied industries have
now been challenged to offer ideas on how NATO's requirements could be
fulfi lled by 2035. Up to six concepts are being sought in order to
encourage a wide variety of innovative solutions, including those that
leverage emerging and disruptive technologies.

[Both of these projects [are in their early steps. Nevertheless]{.mark},
their models [are contesting]{.mark} the [traditional approaches to
defence acquisition]{.mark} by **[embracing disruptive
tech]{.mark}**nology, tapping into industry expertise, and [**leaving
space** for **future capability growth**]{.mark}**.** These projects
[**offer promise** for]{.mark} the [**future adaptability** and
**agility** of **NATO capability development**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
as such deserve close attention and support.

### Link Wall\-\--2NC

#### Commitment\-\--fully embracing emerging tech requires a defense posture that accounts for the uncertainty of future developments\-\--broad acceptance of risk increases the demand for new tech innovations

[In twenty-first century security affairs, NATO forces are required to
be well prepared for possible rules of engagement at all levels and
dimensions. They should be able [to counter]{.mark} symmetrical and
asymmetrical battles, threats or challenges, **[hybrid]{.mark}** or
non-hybrid. At the level of cyber-security and cyber-resilience and
preparedness, scenarios, of possible attacks and battles, can be
anticipated. Along the lines of the new cyber-space operations center,
NATO should prepare operational methods for action, whether this is for
defense or cooperation for cyber-space.]{.underline}

The use and necessity today of technology is limitless. So is the
virtual world of defense and security, where technology and
cyber-defense merge. These are the tools for action.
[**[Tech]{.mark}**nology [plays a **key role**]{.mark} in a global
reach. Yet [**so does NATO**, through the **framework** of]{.mark} a
**[limitless tech]{.mark}**nology applied [in **military
op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}**. NATO uses technology to train,
prepare, ready, deploy, and operate its forces.]{.underline} Technology
for NATO works as tools with which the Alliance protects and defend, yet
also is capable to counter-assault, with counter-measures where and when
is needed, required, or decided.

[Since the adoption of the NATO Cyber-Defense policy]{.underline}
(NATO's Cyber-Defense Policy, 2011), [[NATO trains]{.mark} its military
and civilian assets [for **possible action** against **possible
threats**.]{.mark} NATO is **[constantly]{.mark}** training its forces
in cyber defense]{.underline} training can be achieved through national,
bilateral even multilateral levels of NATO, [through the association of
member states, at the level of Centres of Excellence, such as the NATO
Cyber-Defense Centre for Excellence (CCDCOE)]{.underline} (NATO, n.d.)
[and now through the Cyberspace Operations center]{.underline} in Mons
Belgium. [[**Training and exercises** are]{.mark} now [anticipated to
**expand and enlarge**. So are **multinational
op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} held through remote areas
and locations. [[NATO is now to get **more engaged**]{.mark} in the
field of **cyber-defense**, in both operations and tactics. It is
anticipated within the Alliance that NATO is **well prepared**, both
[for **current** and **future**]{.mark} challenges, countering multiple
and multileveled dimensions of **[cyber-attacks]{.mark}**. Yet, it also
holds an open option, if necessary, to conduct counter-offensives to
prevent further escalation of cyber or military actions]{.underline}
(Hughes, 2009).

[NATO Missions, "will continue to require agile and interoperable,
well-trained and well-led military forces"]{.underline} (Carayannis,
Campbell & Efthymiopoulos, 2014). [This new technological and
operational environment through cyber-defense provides NATO with a new
level of technological possibilities, new tools for use against possible
threats but also protective "cyber-objectives." Allies have an added
policy, mission, and value. [**Ongoing** and **constant**
transformation]{.mark} through its operational and capacity building
resilience, [aims to reach]{.mark} in [**updated capabilities** and
**political excellence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in 2016. NATO aims for
well-coordinated missions in cooperation with and/or participation with
other international organizations, when prompted to react on
international threats or challenges. As such, [NATO has the ability to
continue to be a force and security provided in future potential
of]{.underline}, what we may call it, [the "online" security protection
initiative against all possibly known threats.]{.underline}

[NATO seeks excellence, in [achieving the **best**]{.mark} smartest
**[way to protect]{.mark}** but also counter-attack. By "nature," NATO
exists to prevent and defend member states from attacks. Through **smart
ways** and **agile training**, NATO can counter most known ways of
interface (whether virus or virtual) attacks or even e-spying
attempts.]{.underline}

#### Decision-making framework\-\--centralizing decision gates through complicated management structures ensures capabilities will be over budget, late, and obsolete when delivered\-\--government limitations get in the way of 'business-led' innovations

[During]{.underline} the year [2018, there was a new]{.underline}
security cultural security [comprehension]{.underline}; it is
[considered]{.underline} as [multi-leveled and
multi-dimensional]{.underline}. In 2018's NATO summit of July, [allies
evaluated current developments in cyber-security]{.underline}
considering challenges, threats, but also opportunities. Evaluated
current strategic and geopolitical challenges. [They upheld
methodological preparedness for network defense and operations and
declared under the new NATO command structural reform the setting up of
a cyberspace operations center]{.underline}, as part of the adapted
command structure. [Allies now request for more awareness and openness,
innovation methods, and capacity building in cyber-security, considering
changes in the market economy, more tangible and operational capacity
building through R&D companies. [**Any decision**, considering the
**changing nature of security**]{.mark} and strategic market, [should be
**"business-led"**]{.mark} innovative-led, [promoting]{.mark}
sustainability and growth, [market methods to **uphold NATO's
relevance**]{.mark}, while keeping the public informed]{.underline}. The
public is keen on understanding the operational usefulness of the
alliance, at a time of inside and outside NATO members' landscape
threats and challenges.

**[[Defense capacity building]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the twentieth
century [[requires a **modern way of thinking**]{.mark}. It is about
**[encouraging cooperative defense]{.mark}** at the level of expected
outcomes considering global but also regional risk
assessments.]{.underline} NATO is still to enhance but also maintaining
military capacities and military capabilities.

[The new strategic concept of NATO requests the alliance to move
forward. Twenty-first century needs and challenges require agility and
compatibility of forces and force command at all levels, including
network-centric operations and defense.]{.underline}

[NATO forces, force command, technology, and **[methodological
approach]{.mark}** in military elements and standards [**cannot**
be]{.mark} or remain [**static**. They need to]{.mark} technologically

[In an emerging globalized world, where complexity may become a key
characteristic in strategy and security, **resilience** will become an
**integrated** part of NATOs policy orientation and
application.]{.underline} [[**New**]{.mark} vulnerabilities and
[**threats** continue to emerge. Political pressure will require
NATO]{.mark} leaders [to **take decisions**]{.mark} about the
organization's future]{.underline}. Yet all agree that NATO is a
necessity. As such, [[NATO should become **more open**]{.mark}, more
adaptable, [and]{.mark} more [**flexible**. With]{.mark}]{.underline}
more burden sharing, [[**better smart**]{.mark} budgeting,]{.underline}
long-term **[[planning]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and operational
[application and continued success, [NATO should **continue**
]{.mark}**be re-branded** [as an **adaptive**]{.mark} security
[**organization** that **does more** to offer security]{.mark} and
strategic alignment to truly current but also **future** challenges and
**threats**, that we **may not yet anticipate** or think
of.]{.underline}

In the not so long past, such similar actions reaffirmed by the Heads of
States, included among others, the Treaty of London in 1990 Summit, to
the 1994 Summit in Brussels, and in 1999 over its 50th year anniversary
Summit in Washington, to the immediate decisions taken in 2001 after the
terrorist acts in the USA (NATO, 2001b) to its 60th anniversary, which
was held in Strasbourg and Kiehl accordingly in April 2009 to the
Chicago Summit of 2012 and the Wales Summit of 2014, which added value
to the Alliance and Allies reaffirming NATOs long-term necessity but now
also strategic resilience to multi-dimensional challenges and threats.

[Vulnerabilities and threats considering multidimensional challenges
such as [cyber-security require NATO to be]{.mark} truly, strategically
and operationally **[agile]{.mark}**. It requires NATO to be
**adaptable** to **conditions unforeseen**.]{.underline}

[Considering technological advancements, we are yet to acquaint
ourselves, our institutions, governments, and international
organizations with true phenomena of a new, yet networked global
society. In this borderless society, where electric grids, information,
or installations failures may have in the past solely affect a country,
now affect a region and possibly a larger area. [**Our abilities are
limitless to point out challenges and face them.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[We]{.mark} also [have the ability to **innovate** through
**methodological approaches**]{.mark} and security cooperation

[**[NATO's]{.mark} concept of [cyber-defense]{.mark}** in
2019]{.underline}

It was NATO's Military Committee decision to adopt a "Cyber-Defense
Concept" (Efthymiopoulos, 2008e). The Committee's aim was and still is
to deliver business continuity and military resilience. [[As]{.mark}
NATO is a [provider of **collective defense**]{.mark} and as a
collective organization in a globalized and currently unsafe e-world, it
[needs to be **agile**]{.mark}. In an environment of insecurity, the
Alliance' delivers new policy results. Taking into perspective **new**
forms of asymmetrical **threats**, such as cyber-attacks.]{.underline}

Historically, [the 2002 Prague Summit first marked NATO's tasking
authority committee with regards to **all activities** that should be
held in relations to **cyber-defense**. **As tech**nical **achievements
were delivered**, so **policy-makers delivered policy** results on
cyber-defense. That is why, [Allied leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} during
the Riga Summit of 2006 [[acknowledged the need to]{.underline}]{.mark}
include these as is stated on its decisions at the Press Communiqué: (1)
to [protect NATO's operational information systems, and]{.underline} (2)
to [**[protect]{.mark}** its allied [countries from
**any**]{.mark}]{.underline} e-, or in other words
[**[cyber-attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} by new forms and means
developed by NATO's Allied Command Transformation (ACT) In Norfolk
Virginia.

[The output of the informal Meeting of the Ministers of Defense in
October 2007]{.underline} of NATO (NATO Defence Ministers Meeting, 2007)
[gave way to the inauguration of NATO's Center for Excellence (COE),
which at a later stage got accredited to]{.underline} have
[become]{.underline} the Allied Command Transformation on cyber-defense,
named as [Cooperative Cyber-Defense Centre of Excellence,
CCDCOE]{.underline} (NATO, 2008a). It [was [based on]{.mark} the concept
and early understanding of **[cyber-resilience]{.mark}** for NATO's
future policies in countering challenges and threats]{.underline}, as
was agreed by NATO's Military Committee.

[The central and final decision-making role over the policy of
cyber-defense however is the North Atlantic Council (NAC),]{.underline}
which accordingly is [led by Heads of State and Governments. This is the
highest deciding political authority which decides, creates, and
overviews policy.]{.underline} It also evaluates, considers, and adopts
NATO's policies and activities with regards to political and military
affairs or standing issues on challenges and threats, among others.
Below the NAC, is NATO's Consultation Control and Command Agency (NC3A)
(NATO NC3A, 2002) now transformed to the NCIA agency (NATO, 2008a) and
the NATO Military Authorities (NMA). The latter authority has
implementation as its major task (NATO's Cyber-Defence policy, 2008).

[The implementation of NATO's cyber-defense policy is considered as the
second most important decision by now, once the decisions are taken by
the NAC. The "Concept of Cyber-Defence" "adds practical action
**[programmes]{.mark}**, to [fit within]{.mark} the **[overarching
policy]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (NATO, 2009a). The "Cyber-Defence
Management Authority" that is tasked upon its policy concept "brings
together the key actors in NATO's Cyber-Defence activities." [Its aim is
[to]{.mark} manage and [support **all NATO**]{.mark} communication and
information networked **[systems]{.mark}** and individually allies upon
request]{.underline} (NATO, 2008c).

[NATO's policy creation and activity is "encouraged" by Allies. [The aim
is to **adapt the alliance to**]{.mark} the new strategic and security
environment that is "**[hybrid]{.mark}**" and [thus]{.mark} the creation
of [the **cyber**]{.mark}space operations **[center]{.mark}** in Mons in
Belgium. [To engage **as many**]{.mark} as **possible**
**[governments]{.mark}**, industry-related market [**companies**, and
**individuals**]{.mark}. In accordance to its best practice policy, NATO
considers that its "operational forum" can and should be considered as
the **best joint** operational **[coop]{.mark}**eration [between states
and market]{.mark}, as to also [avoid **duplication of efforts** and use
the **necessary**]{.mark} global [**knowledge** to achieve
**interoperability**]{.mark} of force action and **command** also in
cyber-space.]{.underline}

[Practically, in military policy, implementation, or operational areas,
NATO has adopted "three phases of practical activity and
cooperation":]{.underline} the initial phase includes a NATO Computer
Incident Response Capability (NCIRC). It was established as "interim
operating capability" for NATO to build up on both security risk and
manage the element of cyber-threats. Its second phase involved an ever
more realistic and pragmatic perspective that required the coordination
of all initial "offering" states to the attempt to establish a
cyber-center (under the NATO agreement between states of a voluntary
national contribution---VNC), in bringing the NCIRC to a full
operational capability (NATO, 2008c).

New and innovative policies were adopted. They were proposed and came to
effect (well-known procedure of internal NATO working process) until the
adoption of "MoU"; a memorandum of understanding was drafted and
proposed to NATO, by a sponsoring state which would establish a center
for cyber-training, in this case in Estonia.

From that point on, it became an administrative decision of the Allies,
that once the aforementioned stages would be put into effect, then a
third phase would come into existence. Needless to say, [this third
phase was a complete implementation and **[rule-based]{.mark}**
operational **[procedure]{.mark}** that would soon enough bring about
into existence NATO's request for technological agility and
resilience]{.underline}, which is finalized at the Warsaw Summit of July
2016. [It [consists of]{.mark} incorporating---**lessons
learned**---from the prior two phases as [using]{.mark} new and
**[latest]{.mark}** cyber-defense measures (use of new
**[tech]{.mark}**nology and getting more knowledge on the security
environment), in order [to enhance]{.mark} **cyber-defense
[posture]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Once the third phase was evaluated, the
Allied Command Transformation (ACT) decided, to accredit the operational
center---in this case the Cooperative Cyber Defense (CCD) COE (Estonia),
what is called as a "Centre of Excellence". In turn, this resulted to
the inauguration of the CCDCOE by May 2008.

#### Limiting Article 5 commitment to hybrid threats undermines cyberdefense integration

CDR Wiesław **Goździewicz 16**, Legal Advisor NATO Joint Force Training
Centre, "From Riga to Wales. NATO's Road to Collective Cyberdefence",
NATO Road to Cybersecurity, The Kosciuszko Institute,
https://ik.org.pl/wp-content/uploads/nato_road_to_cybersecurity_the_kosciuszko_institute_2016.pdf

[The Wales Summit Declaration]{.underline}8 was a major step forward in
acknowledging the challenges posed by complex cyberattacks. It was the
first official document in which the Member Nations of the Alliance
confirmed the possibility of a cyberattack to cross the threshold of an
armed attack and thus become the basis for invoking Article 5 of the
North Atlantic Treaty. It was reiterated that cyberthreats and attacks
would continue to become more common, sophisticated, and potentially
damaging. In Paragraph 72, the Alliance Nations declared that:

"Cyberattacks can reach a threshold that threatens national and
EuroAtlantic prosperity, security, and stability. Their impact could be
as harmful to modern societies as a conventional attack. We affirm
therefore that cyber defence is part of NATO's core task of collective
defence. A decision as to when a cyberattack would lead to the
invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on
a case-by-case basis."

[This clearly demonstrates [the Alliance's view]{.mark} whereby
cyberattacks can cross the threshold of an armed attack, allowing
individual or collective self-defence to be invocated under both Article
51 of the UN Charterand Article 5 of the North Atlantic
Treaty]{.underline}. Moreover, for the first time since NATO took on the
topic of cyberdefence in 2006, it was explicitly stated that
cyberdefence became part of the Alliance's collective defence tasks and
efforts.

[The Member Nations adopted the Enhanced Cyber Defence Policy (ECDP)
which [reaffirms]{.mark} the principles of the [**indivisibility** of
Allied security]{.mark} and of prevention, detection, resilience,
recovery, and defence and clearly states that]{.underline} "(...)[the
fundamental cyber defence responsibility of NATO is to defend its own
networks, and that assistance to Allies should be addressed in
accordance with the spirit of solidarity, [emphasizing]{.mark} the
**[responsibility]{.mark}** of Allies [to develop]{.mark} the
[**relevant capabilities** for]{.mark} the [protection]{.mark} of
national networks."]{.underline} The ECDP recognises the applicability
of international law to cyber operations, including the International
Humanitarian Law (IHL) or the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC).

[The Nations committed themselves to further develop their national
cyberdefence capabilities and enhance the cybersecurity of their
networks, upon which the Alliance depends]{.underline}. NATO's top
priority for cyberdefence is the protection of NATO-owned communications
and information systems (CIS); however, [[the Alliance will **assist**
the Nations in defending their national networks **considered critical**
for NATO's missions]{.mark}.]{.underline} For this purpose, [the
Alliance cooperates with national authorities to ensure an appropriate
level of cyberdefence of national CIS.]{.underline} Such cooperation is
being formalised in Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) signed between the
Cyber Defence Management Board and the respective nations. Cyberdefence
MOUs are based upon a template developed in the Cyber Defence Action
Plan in line with the principles of the ECDP. [They set the foundations
for mutual support in the area of cyberdefence, including
**[info]{.mark}**rmation **[sharing]{.mark}**, participation in
**[training]{.mark}** and **[exercises]{.mark}** as well as the
provision of reciprocal assistance in the form of
**[intel]{.mark}**ligence and **["manpower"]{.mark}**]{.underline} [(CIS
specialists and cyberdefence experts).]{.underline} The Czech Republic
was the first NATO Nation to sign such a MOU on 12 October 2015.9
Assistance to Allies may be provided by one of the Rapid Reaction Teams
formed by the NCIA as part of the Alliance's collective cyberdefence
capability.10

[The Wales Summit Declaration further [provided]{.mark} for a continued
[**integration** of cyberdefence into **NATO
op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}** and operational and contingency
planning, as well as the enhancement of information sharing and
situational awareness among Allies. The key role of partnerships in
addressing cyberthreats was stressed.]{.underline}

Also [the ECDP requires NATO to include cyberdefence aspects in the
**[defence planning]{.mark}** process.]{.underline} This has been
achieved by implementing respective cyberdefence annexes in Operations
Plans (OPLANs) developed for real-life operations, training and
exercises as well as contingency plans. The training and exercise
programme has grown to include cyber-specific exercises such as Cyber
Coalition and Locked Shields. In addition, an extensive cyberdefence
play has been incorporated into more "classic" training and exercises,
including the biggest NATO exercise over the last decade -- Trident
Juncture 15 and Coalition Warrior Interoperability eXploration,
eXperimentation, eXamination, eXercise (CWIX), to which the Joint Force
Training Centre has been the proud host for the last five years.11

[One of the most important aspects of the NATO ECDP is cooperation in
broad terms: with NATO Nations]{.underline} (as described above),
[Partner Nations, international actors such as the UN and the EU,
industry and academia.]{.underline} [**[Coop]{.mark}**eration [with
**industry** has been formalised]{.mark} in the NATO Industry Cyber
Partnership (NICP), which was founded and endorsed by the Alliance
**[based]{.mark}** up[**on** the conclusion]{.mark} that [NATO and
industry faced **shared risks**]{.mark} in cyberspace, and that
addressing these challenges required new frameworks for action. Within
the NICP framework, the NCIA has launched the cybersecurity incubator
concept tasked to develop a new model for NATO-industry cooperation with
the aim to decrease the time required for NATO to develop its cyber
response capabilities, based upon the results of research and
development programmes already run by industry and
academia.]{.underline}

There are many other cooperation frameworks such as the Cyber
Information and Incident Coordination System (CIIS), a web-based
application developed for sharing cyberdefence information within a
trusted community and available to all NATO Nations and Partner Nations
as well as commercial organizations.

NATO does not develop offensive cyber capabilities. Although the
Alliance focuses on defence against cyberattacks, it does not preclude
particular Member Nations from developing their own national offensive
cyber capabilities. In fact, there are nations who openly admit they
pursue such capabilities involving "(...)countering (disorganising,
jamming and destroying) the sources of threats (active defence and
offensive actions) (...)".12 As a matter of fact, NATO Rules of
Engagement13 in Series 36 (Information Operations) envisage the
possibility of conducting offensive computer network operations (namely
Computer Network Attacks -- CNAs); however, none of these offensive ROEs
have been authorised so far by the North Atlantic Council in operations
or exercises.

This short text hopefully illustrates how [NATO's approach to
cyberdefence has evolved over the last decade to culminate in a
[**clear** and **unambiguous** declaration that **cyberattacks can
trigger**]{.mark} the invocation of **[Article 5]{.mark}.** While the
Alliance is committed to assist Allies in their defence efforts, it
encourages the Member Nations to develop their own cyberdefence
capabilities in the spirit of Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty.
This evolutionary approach [should be **continued** to ensure the
**adaptation**]{.mark} of the Alliance's cyberdefence policy [to **new
trends**]{.mark} in cyber operations, [including]{.mark} the development
of response options to]{.underline} e.g.:

[1) cyber actions amounting to armed attacks;]{.underline}

[2) [the possibility of a **broader application** of cyber means]{.mark}
and methods [of war]{.mark}fare [in **future
conflicts**]{.mark};]{.underline}

[3) terrorist acts with the use of cyber means.]{.underline}

[**[Adaptability]{.mark}** and **[flexibility]{.mark}** as well as [a
**broad range of response**]{.mark} options [are a **must**]{.mark} in
the world where the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure are no
secret and neither is the reliance of countries on critical
infrastructure]{.underline} which in many cases is shared between two or
more countries.

### Link Wall\-\--Baltics

#### Baltic participation in tech innovation to counter hybrid threats drives multilateral adoption throughout Europe 

Justinas **Mickus 19**, Associate Analyst of Vilnius Institute for
Political Analysis, and Piret Kuusik, International Centre of Defence
and Security Junior Researcher, October 2019, "The Baltic Risk
Landscape,"
https://efpi.icds.ee/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2019/11/Mickus-Kuusik_The-Baltic-Risk-Landscape_October-2019.pdf

To an extent, then, the [developed [expertise]{.mark} in [combatting
cyber threats can]{.mark}]{.underline} and already has
**[[enable]{.underline}]{.mark}**d [the [Baltic]{.mark} state[**s** to
**set multilateral standards and**]{.mark} **craft [collective]{.mark}
policy [solutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the field. And yet, [with
the increasingly widespread appreciation of hybrid and next-generation
threats, the comparative advantage the Baltics have today will likely
decrease in the future. Should Baltic politicians]{.underline} wish to
[further pursue [leadership in cyber and hybrid security]{.mark}, they
[will **require further policy innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline} (a
similar note could be made about the self-declared Baltic expertise on
Russian/Eastern Neighborhood questions more broadly).

The Baltics, certainly, may also focus on other areas in which they play
a unique role and boast unique expertise. Today, individual Baltic
states have made significant inroads in developing notable expertise in
e-governance (Estonia) or fintech (Lithuania). Survey respondents from
Latvia and Estonia also demonstrate high appreciation for and diverse
understanding of the impact the rising pace of technological change is
likely have on Baltic politics. For both sets of respondents, this trend
ranks among the top three and is connected with various economic,
societal, and security risks (by contrast, increasing cyber-dependence
is primarily through the security lens).

Whether they choose [[to further develop]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[hybrid and cyber capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} or expand their
focus to different fields, the [[Baltic states stand to benefit
from]{.mark} international **[coop]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}. As
[**[continuous]{.mark} policy [innovation requires new inputs]{.mark}**,
seeking diverse [international partnerships]{.mark} can greatly
[augment]{.mark} the [policy instruments]{.mark} currently employed by
the Baltic states]{.underline}. For example, should the Baltic
governments focus on the trend of ageing population (among the experts
surveyed, it ranked as the most important trend in the Baltic region),
the could consult the expertise and experience of Japan, which has
recently developed an ambitious strategy of tackling the transformation
into a digital society for an ageing population.11

ACTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE MEMBERSHIP

Unique expertise alone is not sufficient for small states to shape the
international order with the use of postwar institutions -- there is a
difference between being a one-issue state and the leader on the issue.
[[Small states must]{.mark} **simultaneously [be]{.mark} active and
[constructive partners]{.mark}** [to other members of the core group
of]{.mark} the [postwar order]{.mark}]{.underline}. As their
institutional innovations need the assent and backing of greater powers
to have any tangible effect, [fostering stable and [productive
partnerships with key allied powers]{.mark} to secure their buy-in
[is]{.mark} a [necessary]{.mark} tactic for small states]{.underline}.

#### NATO's hybrid warfare planning is [concentrated]{.underline} in the Baltics.

[Russia's]{.underline} illegal [annexation of]{.underline}
**[[Crimea]{.underline}]{.mark}** in March 2014 [and its military
actions in]{.underline} [Ukraine have [led]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[transatlantic policy-makers]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[reassess]{.mark} collective [defence
arrangements]{.mark}]{.underline}** [across what is frequently referred
to as NATO's "eastern flank".]{.underline} [Extending north]{.underline}
partially beyond the "eastern flank" [is a region that comprises
eight]{.underline} Nordic and **[[Baltic states]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[which have become]{.underline} [increasingly
interdependent]{.underline} in security terms. [The region [is
of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[rising importance]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[in]{.mark} the context of Europe's changing security
order]{.underline} -- [and]{.underline} **[[defence and
deterrence]{.mark} is set to be high on the agenda]{.underline}** [at
NATO's summit meeting in Warsaw]{.underline}, Poland, in July.

[NATO has a]{.underline} **[strong role]{.underline}** [in coordinating
closer security ties]{.underline} between the region's states. Finland
and Sweden are not members of the Alliance and are therefore not covered
by NATO's collective defence clause. However, [the [Allies are]{.mark}
[working]{.mark} closely]{.underline} with both countries -- two of
NATO's most active partners -- [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[assess
security]{.mark} [in the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Baltic Sea
region]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[expand
exchanges of information]{.underline}]{.mark}, including **[[on hybrid
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**, coordinating training and exercises,
[and to]{.underline} **[[develop better]{.mark} [joint situational
awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[The prospects are positive for]{.underline} [improved]{.underline}
NATO-Nordic-[Baltic defence cooperation]{.underline}, yet a number of
important challenges need to be overcome. [The [region will
test]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[NATO's flexibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[in strengthening defence ties]{.underline} among its members and
crucial partner states.

#### Bolstering hybrid response in the Baltics is the [first step]{.underline} towards broader NATO/EU adoption

Andrew **Radin 17**, political scientist at the RAND Corporation, 2017,
"Hybrid Warfare in the Baltics: Threats and Potential Responses,"
https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1500/RR1577/RAND_RR1577.pdf

[[Improving]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[response to]{.underline}]{.mark}
potential [[Russian covert action can be]{.mark} thought of in [three
phases]{.mark}: detecting and [attributing Russian
action]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[strengthening]{.underline}**]{.mark}
the [[**capacity of the Baltics to respond**, and **formulating an
effective**]{.mark} **and appropriate [EU and NATO
response]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Better intelligence gathering and coordination and a clearer
understanding of the signs of Russian covert aggression can help bolster
defenses against active subversion. U.S. Air Force assets, such as
unmanned aerial vehicles and ground-based radars, could be beneficial at
filling gaps in these countries' existing intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance capabilities, both for covert action and conventional
warfare.7 [[NATO is]{.underline}]{.mark} also currently
[[undertaking]{.mark} several [initiatives to improve
**intel**]{.mark}ligence [and coordination]{.mark} related [to Russian
covert action]{.mark}]{.underline}, including developing shared
indicators and warnings, NATO Force Integration Units (NFIUs), and
combined exercises. Although NATO has made progress in developing
institutions for intelligence sharing, NATO's structures and processes
for intelligence sharing remain cumbersome and dependent on
often-reluctant nations to share.8 Given NATO's slow progress in this
area, [further [developing bilateral]{.mark} intelligence [sharing
between]{.mark} the [Baltic countries and]{.mark}]{.underline} the
United States or [[other NATO countries could be
valuable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Additional research could also contribute
by identifying the signs and mechanisms of past instances of large-scale
Russian covert activities in Georgia, Crimea, and eastern Ukraine. So
far, there is little open source information about how to differentiate
between "everyday" Russian exercises and influence operations and the
start of a large-scale campaign mirroring the operation in Crimea. More
clearly identifying the modus operandi of Russian agents would help to
separate out the cases that justify a NATO deployment and those that
might not.

The capacity of the Baltic countries to counter covert action can
certainly be improved. U.S. special operations forces have conducted
extensive engagement with their Baltic counterparts, to the point that
there is a sense of saturation, especially given the small size of the
Baltic special operations forces. Additional research may be beneficial
to help identify gaps in the Baltic countries' capacity, including
within civilian agencies, and to conduct targeted missions that could
offer more focused benefits. Support for the Baltic states to counter
covert action may also strengthen their ability to resist Russia in the
event of an invasion.9 The U.S. Air Force may be able to directly assist
with the development of technical capabilities for border control, air
and maritime domain awareness, and intelligence gathering, including
assistance with acquiring unmanned aerial vehicles, radars, and other
sensors. Another specific area where the United States may be able to
offer assistance is in planning exercises and war games to improve
contingency planning and coordination, especially in Latvia.

Finally, the United States, [[NATO, and the Baltic countries can do
more]{.mark} to think practically through how a response to Russian
covert action would proceed]{.underline}. The 2014 Wales Summit focused
on the development of greater "responsiveness" through the Readiness
Action Plan and the creation of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force
(VJTF). However, it remains uncertain how these new, more responsive
forces would be employed if there was warning of a significant Russian
covert (or conventional) military action in the Baltics.10 While the
development of the VJTF and implementation of the Readiness Action Plan
is complex and will take time, [[it is highly beneficial for]{.mark} the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and other [NATO allies
to think through]{.mark} on a practical level [how]{.mark} a
[high-readiness forces would deploy]{.mark} and be employed [in the
Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}, and how they would coordinate its actions
with the Baltic security forces.

Sceptics will say this would present big tech with too many
opportunities for mergers and acquisitions and thus create monopolistic
risk. They might be right and clearly incentives for all parties would
need to be found. But, [[if we are to win the **tech**]{.mark}nological
[**adoption race** built]{.mark} up[on]{.mark} [**liberal democratic
values**, we need to use **every advantage we
have**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[To **utilise**, **adopt** and **scale**]{.mark} these technologies
[effectively, we must have]{.mark} at the forefront of our minds the
need to [work at the **speed of relevance** rather than the **speed of
approval**. This means **new**]{.mark} ways of **[financing]{.mark}**
technologies, interacting with tech firms both big and small, and much
more [**agile acquisition**]{.mark} models, [which carry]{.mark} the
empowerment and [**incentives** to]{.mark} those responsible for
**[equip]{.mark}**ping **[the Alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Such a
cultural shift will not be easy -- but innovation rarely is.

[As we look towards NATO 2030]{.underline} and heed Eisenhower's words
of achieving both security and solvency, while noting that the
foundation of military strength is economic strength, [[a **resilient
innovation pipeline** that leverages our **comparative advantage**,
**creativity** and **capital** will be **critical** to]{.mark} the
Alliance [maintaining]{.mark} its **[tech]{.mark}**nological [**edge**

### Innovation IL\-\--NATO-Led Key

#### NATO is key to innovation\-\--fragmenting efforts won't means we lose the tech edge to competitors

#### NATO focus has a stronger effect on innovation priorities

[But before we get to commercialisation, we need to create the direction
of what it is we wish to see commercialised. Technological disruptive
[innovation]{.mark} does not just happen. It [starts with a
**mission-oriented vision**, where **measuring risk** is impossible
and]{.mark} only [**uncertainty** reigns. It requires **bold moves**
that will **signpost the future**; the **confidence** to place **big
bets** on tech]{.mark}nology [not yet invented; and an ability to **pick
winners**]{.mark} -- all of [which must be underpinned by **persistent
engagement**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} encouragement and
enlightenment. Since the end of the Second World War, only one entity
has taken-on such uncertainty: Allied governments (see image below).

Step 1: agree innovation priorities among Allies

[[The **first step** towards **fixing**]{.mark} the
**[fragmentation]{.mark}** of Allied disruptive innovation [is for
Allies, through the **NATO framework**, to focus on **agreed innovation
priorities**.]{.mark} This will allow them to pick winners and invest
public patient capital]{.underline} -- the private sector is unlikely to
invest venture capital as the risk is simply too high (nations tend not
to go out of business and can take on such uncertainty). [This
[**direction** and **investment** will]{.mark} help to [maintain
NATO's]{.mark} overarching **[tech]{.mark}**nological
**[edge]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Indeed, as Keynes and Weber argued, [the
ability to make things happen that otherwise would not needs a
combination of technological, policy and bureaucratic skills matched by
investment]{.underline}

#### Networking is key to maximize innovation

https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2020/09/01/building-a-resilient-innovation-pipeline-for-the-alliance/

Step 2: leverage the comparative advantage of the Alliance

[If Allies are [to achieve most defence at less cost with least
delay]{.mark} built with wisdom and efficiency, then it is logical to
[leverage]{.mark} those natural [advantages that **geography** and
**skill sets** afford]{.mark} NATO **[member]{.mark}**
state**[s]{.mark}**. [A **network** of the finest universities]{.mark}
across the Alliance [should be established and resourced to allow
**cutting-edge multinational research** to take place across **multiple
disruptive tech**]{.mark}nologies **[simultaneously]{.mark}**. Perhaps
Stanford could lead on relevant AI research, while Delft and the
University of Chicago partner on quantum; maybe Imperial College London
looks at biotechnologies with Johns Hopkins University, while Tallinn
University centres its efforts on next generation cyber defences; and
the École Polytechnique and Massachusetts Institute of Technology
examine future telecommunication needs.]{.underline}

The point is [[**Allies** will need to leverage such networks]{.mark} of
universities [in **conjunction** with]{.mark} national
**[government]{.mark}** research [labs to provide **maximum innovation
coherence**.]{.mark} The [**diversity** of]{.mark} multinational,
multi-disciplined defence and security innovation [research
teams]{.mark}, which NATO can engender, [is a **huge asset** and]{.mark}
is [the Alliance's **competitive advantage**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

#### Solves foreign ownership concerns

Utilise, adopt and scale

[Where the first stage of NATO's innovation pipeline should centre on
the creation of disruptive innovative technologies, stage two is all
about their [**utilisation** and **adoption at
scale.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Utilisation

[This [is where]{.mark} initial **[public]{.mark}** venture capital
(**[VC]{.mark}**) entities]{.underline}, such as in-q-tel, NSSIF,
DefInvest and SmartCap, [[can]{.mark} help **['crowd in']{.mark}**
trusted **[private v]{.mark}**enture **[c]{.mark}**apital [to provide
**safe financing**]{.mark} to NATO's fledgling start-ups, thereby
[minimising]{.mark} their [susceptibility to **nefarious
f**]{.mark}oreign **[d]{.mark}**irect **[i]{.mark}**nvestment. This
issue is [impacting]{.mark} many [start-ups]{.mark} as they raise funds
and carries implications [when they wish to **export**]{.mark} their
products [but may not]{.mark} be able to, [due to **unfriendly foreign
ownership** and **tech**]{.mark}nology [**transfer** concerns]{.mark}
raised by Allied governments.]{.underline}

In addition to Venture Capital entities supporting the trusted financing
of Allied start-ups, **[[innovation accelerators]{.underline}]{.mark}**
-- in combination with elite universities, and [[supported by **Allied
defence professionals**]{.underline}]{.mark} (operators, investors and
procurement experts) -- [[can]{.mark} help [provide the **necessary
'polish'**]{.mark} to start-ups and their value propositions. This will
create the necessary ecosystem [to **maximise**]{.mark} the
[**likelihood** of **commercial success**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
United States' Air Force Ventures is an interesting model of this
approach, which helps to acquire new start-up products at speed without
being bogged down by acquisition bureaucracy.

#### Startups need NATO to get off the ground

Rob **Murray 20**, head of the Innovation Unit in NATO's Emerging
Security Challenges Division, MSc, ISR Management, University of
Lincoln, MBA, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, MA,
International Policy and Diplomacy, Staffordshire University, 9/1/20,
\"Building a resilient innovation pipeline for the Alliance\", NATO
Review,
https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2020/09/01/building-a-resilient-innovation-pipeline-for-the-alliance/

Adoption

But even when dual-use disruptive innovation is commercialised, turned
into prototypes and the product/market fit is achieved, [the challenge
of getting initial contracts from customers]{.underline} (both
government and commercial) remains. [Cash is king for **[young
companies]{.mark}**, as they [do not have]{.mark} the [**financial
reserves** to work through **long acquisition processes**]{.mark} often
[associated with **Allied governments**]{.mark}. If start-ups cannot
close deals in a matter of weeks and months rather than quarters and
years, then they would not attempt to (opportunity cost).]{.underline}

Now, some commentators may argue: Why spend so much time discussing
start-ups? Traditional large armaments companies can be innovative. Why
go through all this effort for tiny companies that may or may not make
it?

The reason is simple: [the competition and creativity generated by
**[start-ups]{.mark}** is good for the **Allied defence ecosystem**.
Allied open democracies and open educational models bring about levels
of creativity which other forms of government are unable to do. This
[**maximises**]{.mark} disruptive [innovation]{.mark} efforts and, as
such, [forces incumbents]{.mark} (large companies) [to
**compete**]{.mark} with new, fresh thinking -- it [builds
**resilience**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Such [**creativity** and **disruption** is **NATO's competitive
advantage**]{.mark}. Therefore, [NATO needs to]{.mark} adapt its
acquisition models to [accommodate start-ups,]{.mark} their timelines
and their potential. This fundamentally means our acquisition
professionals should be empowered to take measurable risk]{.underline}.
As one Ally's legislative body recently remarked: "[[Defence
stakeholders must **integrate the risk culture**]{.mark}, which is [the
**only way** to both **enable innovation**]{.mark} in defence and to
very quickly capture dual or civilian innovation. Acculturation to
innovation is a priority]{.underline}."

Scaling

[If we have managed to commercialise new technology, adopt it quickly as
a prototype and now wish to scale, how might this be done? Big tech
could have a role to play here]{.underline}. In May, it was reported
that, in the first quarter of 2020, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet
and Microsoft spent over 29 billion US dollars on research and
development (R&D). That is more than the entire 2020 NASA budget and
represents a 17 per cent increase on the same time period last year.

In November 2018, the US Congressional Research Service noted: "In 1960,
the United States accounted for 69% of global R&D, with U.S.
defense-related R&D alone accounting for more than one-third of global
R&D (36%). Additionally, the federal government funded approximately
twice as much R&D as U.S. business. However, from 1960 to 2016, the U.S.
share of global R&D fell to 28%, and the federal government's share of
total U.S. R&D fell from 65% to 24%, while business's share more than
doubled from 33% to 67%. As a result of these global, national, and
federal trends, federal defense R&D's share of total global R&D fell to
3.7% in 2016."

[[**Big tech** has the **resources** and **wherewithal**]{.mark} to be
able [to **scale new tech**]{.mark}nologies [at **speed**. They
could]{.mark} partner with successful start-ups, perhaps
[through]{.mark} a joint venture or [an **Alliance-wide
p**]{.mark}ublic-**[p]{.mark}**rivate **[p]{.mark}**artnership, to
[provide]{.mark} those [scale-up skills that start-ups lack]{.mark} (for
example, [compliance, legal support, production on mass,
i]{.mark}ntellectual [p]{.mark}roperty [protection]{.mark})]{.underline}
without necessarily acquiring these young companies.

### Innovation IL\-\--AT: Gov Innovation Fails

#### Gov innovation works

As the image above shows, [[governments have **done this

(**[internet]{.mark}**, **[GPS]{.mark}**, **[touchscreen]{.mark}** et
al, which fed into the building of the iPod and [**iPhone**) have had a

all those successes, there]{.mark} will [have been many
**failures**]{.mark} and **[this is where Allies will need to get
comfortable]{.mark}**.]{.underline} To quote one anonymous Allied
defence innovator: ["[if]{.mark} our [success rate]{.mark} begins to [go

stopped taking big enough risks**]{.mark}."]{.underline} Indeed,
[obvious research areas Allies might collaborate on include the

[[In aggregate, the Alliance has an abundance of world-class academic
institutions]{.mark}, the finest scientific [researchers]{.mark},
amazingly creative [start-ups]{.mark} and a mature [well-resourced
financial eco-system]{.mark}.]{.underline} These constitute [[the core
ingredients]{.mark}, which, [when combined and focused, can
solve]{.mark} dual-use, ['tough-tech' problems]{.mark}]{.underline} --
that is, challenges facing both defence and non-defence sectors, such as
augmented reality and quantum computing.

#### Yes incentive

https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2020/09/01/building-a-resilient-innovation-pipeline-for-the-alliance/

[[A dual-use model is important]{.mark} for disruptive defence
innovation because when we eventually get to commercialising such
tough-tech breakthroughs, Allies will need start-ups and tech firms [to
maximise]{.mark} the [reach of]{.mark} their [products]{.mark} by
looking at 'total addressable problems' rather than 'total addressable
markets'.]{.underline} In other words, we should not want start-ups
building the next wave of technology to have governments as their only
customer. We want such technologies to benefit society too and therefore
have civil, commercial use. Such [[commercial use]{.underline}]{.mark}
then [[drives]{.underline}]{.mark} the [subsequent [development]{.mark}
of said technology, pulling the government-side along with it, [which
means better products]{.mark} and technology all round -- building
defence with wisdom and efficiency.]{.underline}

Indeed, [[dual-use potential will]{.mark} help [align]{.mark} the
[incentives]{.mark} of our researchers, entrepreneurs and finance
communities [as]{.mark} the [prospective commercial upside]{.mark}
(problem) [will be big enough for them to undertake]{.mark} the
[investment]{.mark} of commercialisation. [The geopolitical
advantage]{.mark} such disruptive innovation fosters (picking winners
via big bets on the next breakthrough) [will]{.mark} also [be large
enough]{.mark} to allow [for]{.mark} its [creation via early
stage]{.mark} patient [public]{.mark} sector capital
[investment]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Innovation IL\-\--Commitment Key

#### Commitment generates urgency\-\--motivation gaps risk military failure 

Paul **Bernstein 19**, a distinguished research fellow at the Center for
the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD Center) of the National
Defense University in Washington, DC, ""Innovating" Versus

Second, [**[we need a sense of urgency]{.mark}** and the means to
accurately assess what others are doing. [Russia and China are committed
to developing **leading-edge military tech**]{.mark}nologies and
fielding "high-tech forces"]{.underline} in part [because they see U.S.
dominance as an existential threat. [They are **highly motivated**. It
is **not clear** the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [is]{.mark}
as sharply motivated, [which creates]{.mark} the potential for
[a]{.mark} focus or [**commitment gap**. Closing]{.mark} any [such gap
is something leadership should pay attention to; otherwise it may take a
**crisis** or a **military failure** to generate the necessary sense of
urgency]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Innovation IL\-\--Integration Key

#### Integration is key\-\--we need to incorporate all elements of innovation to outcompete great powers 

Paul **Bernstein 19**, a distinguished research fellow at the Center for
the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD Center) of the National
Defense University in Washington, DC, ""Innovating" Versus
"Out-Innovating": Innovation as a Form of Strategic Competition",
Getting Innovation Right, Center for Global Security Research, Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, Sept 2019,
https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1635772

Third, [[we need an **integrated**]{.mark} approach. A [**dynamic**
approach to **innovating**]{.mark} for operational [advantage requires
taking account of **all forms** of innovation, determining the
**appropriate mix** for the **types of conflicts**]{.mark} the armed
[forces are likely to engage in]{.mark} and the specific operational
challenges they will need to overcome. [Innovation encompasses]{.mark}
not only **[tech]{.mark}**nology but also operational [**concepts**
and]{.mark} organization/ **[process]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Military
innovation and transformation leaders have long argued against an
overemphasis on technology at the expense of other factors. Typically it
is some combination of technology, concepts, and organization that
provides a basis for breakthroughs. Often we are reminded of this when
an adversary demonstrates it.

High-end regional war is generally the default lens through which we
view requirements for innovation and it may be true that the bulk of
defense innovation will be directed at this problem. But [[the
**spectrum of conflict**]{.mark} also [includes **hybrid
warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline} (a mix of regular and irregular armed
conflict) [and coercive activities short of armed conflict ("political
warfare")]{.underline}---modes of conflict that are not entirely new,
but whose contemporary manifestations are indeed novel and for which the
United States generally seems poorly prepared. [[We **cannot
dismiss**]{.mark} the requirements for [innovation in these aspects of
**great power competition**]{.mark}, not least because [they may lead us
down pathways]{.mark} much [different from]{.mark} those shaped by the
demands of [highend]{.mark} regional [war]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The following matrix may be useful as a very simple way to visualize the
"battlespace" for innovation.

It is worth noting here that political warfare may be somewhat anomalous
when considered as an arena of great power competition. In this domain,
[[the goal of the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark}
its **[partners]{.mark}** is]{.underline} not to out-innovate
adversaries so as to build the more advanced toolkit for political
subversion, social division, economic warfare, and coercion. Rather, the
West's goal is [to greatly [improve the ability of liberal states to
**reduce**]{.mark} their **[vulnerability]{.mark}** to such strategies
[and]{.mark} actively **[resist]{.mark}** them.]{.underline} This is a
somewhat different context for innovation, but an important one given
the strategic stakes.

### Innovation Impact\-\--China AI

#### China AI competition escalates

Calum **Chace 20**, co-founder of the Economic Singularity Foundation,
global keynote speaker about AI, MBA, Cranfield University, 6/30/20,
\"Thucydides And The Dragon: Artificial Intelligence And Sino-US
Rivalry\", Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/calumchace/2020/06/30/thucydides-and-the-dragon-artificial-intelligence-and-sino-us-rivalry/#1c7a93d94fc1

From Cold War to Code War?

[[The **most dangerous**]{.mark} source of [**conflict** could
be]{.mark} **China**'s determination to catch up with and then surpass
America as the leading developer of **AI**, our most powerful
technology]{.underline}. Some fear that [the Cold War between the two
nuclear superpowers could be followed by [a **Code War** between]{.mark}
its [**two AI superpowers**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Taiwanese venture capitalist Kai-Fu Lee, a former Google and Apple
executive, argues that China will overhaul the US in AI because it has
more hard-working and aggressive entrepreneurs and researchers, and also
because it has a disregard for privacy which allows its researchers to
amass more data. ["If data is the new oil, China is the new Saudi
Arabia",]{.underline} as one critic put it.

It is true that the 9-9-6 work ethic (72 hours a week) makes Chinese
startup scene a highly competitive one. Many Chinese students no longer
want to stay in the US when they finish their degrees in computer
science. They are keen to return home and get rich there.

Do Chinese people care about privacy?

It is also true that China's attitude to privacy distinguishes it from
the US, and even more from Europe. The Social Credit system being
pioneered today has the potential to become a level of government
surveillance that would make Big Brother jealous. This is happening
partly because the communist party wills it so, and resistance is pretty
much impossible for most citizens. It is also partly because corruption
is endemic and severe in China, and levels of trust outside family
networks are low. A system which punishes anti-social behaviour swiftly
and effectively is less resisted in China than it would be elsewhere.

But we should not over-state the extent to which being oblivious to
privacy issues is a killer app. China watcher JJ Ding argues that
Chinese people do care about privacy, and that the government knows it
cannot take their acceptance for granted. [The US tech giants still have
a significant lead in technology and expertise, and they still have
momentum. AI is increasingly a duopoly between China and the US, not an
emerging Chinese hegemony.]{.underline}

The US managed to avoid the utter disaster of full-scale military
confrontation with the Soviet Union, and in many ways its relations with
China are much closer, which should make confrontation less dangerous.
The US economy is less open than those of most developed countries --
trade accounts for 27% of US GDP, compared to 61% for the UK, and 33%
for China. But the US and Chinese economies are far more entwined than
America's ever was with the Soviet Union. GM sells more cars in China
than in the USA and Canada combined, and Apple, Qualcomm and most other
large US companies are similarly exposed.

[Avoiding the splinternet: a role for Europe]{.underline}

Trump's populist attacks on Huawei won't kill it, although they could
certainly curb its growth, and perhaps shrink it for a while. In the
longer run they could easily have the perverse effect of damaging the US
tech sector: [[China may decide]{.mark} that [America is]{.mark} an
inherently **[untrustworthy]{.mark}** partner, and make the very heavy
investments of time and treasure required to wean itself off US
suppliers, and build its own chip industry]{.underline}, for instance.
[They could [lead to **"the splinternet"**]{.mark}**,** a
[fracturing]{.mark} of [the]{.mark} world's [tech]{.mark}nology
[ecosystem]{.mark} into two distinct communities, [which]{.mark} would
[make **global co-op**]{.mark}eration [harder]{.mark}, and
[provoke]{.mark} mutual [**fear**]{.mark} and suspicion.]{.underline}

[[**War**]{.mark} between China and the US (or NATO) [is the
worst]{.mark} possible [outcome]{.mark}, but at this stage it still
looks unlikely. [Both]{.mark} the US and Chinese [governments must walk
a tightrope between]{.mark} pursuing their legitimate grievances on the
one hand, and **[provoking]{.mark}** outright [**hostility** and
**communications breakdown**]{.mark} on the other.]{.underline} This
requires wisdom and diplomatic skills which are not prominently on
display in both Beijing and Washington at the moment.

[[It would help if there were **three AI superpowers**]{.mark}, not just
two]{.underline}. AI is not a race, as there is no finish line, and
unless the internet splinters completely, the advances made by any party
help everyone. [[But at the moment, **Europe** is barely involved.
**That ought to change**]{.mark}, and soon.]{.underline}

### Innovation Impact\-\--China Quantum

#### China quantum competition escalates

Arthur **Herman 19**, director of the Hudson Institute\'s Quantum
Alliance Initiative, 11/10/19, \"The Quantum Computing Threat to
American Security\", Wall Street Journal,
https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-quantum-computing-threat-to-american-security-11573411715

Google announced last month that it had achieved **[[\"quantum
supremacy,\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** demonstrating the potential of [a
new kind of computer that can perform certain tasks many orders of
magnitude faster than the most advanced supercomputers.]{.underline}
It\'s [a [**crucial**]{.mark} moment [for **America\'s national
security**, which depends on **winning the race** to]{.mark} do what
quantum computers will do best: [decrypt]{.mark} the vast majority of
existing [public]{.mark}-key encryption [systems]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Google reports that its quantum computer, dubbed Sycamore, solved a
mathematical calculation in 200 seconds that would take a supercomputer
10,000 years. IBM, a quantum competitor, asserted that Google\'s claim
of supremacy is overblown, and that the world\'s most powerful classical
computer, the Summit OLCF-4 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, could have
done the same calculation in 2.5 days---roughly a thousandfold
difference rather than 1.5 trillionfold. Still, [[quantum
computers]{.mark} are no longer science fiction.]{.underline}

To process information, digital computers use bits, essentially switches
that can be either off or on, corresponding with the binary digits, 0
and 1. Quantum computers employ \"qubits,\" which use the probabilistic
nature of quantum physics to represent any combination of 0 and 1
simultaneously, enabling them to encode more complicated data.

Their computing power grows exponentially as the number of qubits
expands. Sycamore\'s 54-qubit chip allowed it to outcompute the best
supercomputer. [A 2,000- to 4,000-qubit quantum computer [would render
most]{.mark} public-key **[encryption]{.mark}** architectures---used for
applications [from **banking**]{.mark} and credit cards [to the]{.mark}
power [**grid**---**obsolete**]{.mark}.]{.underline} They rely on
numbers too big for conventional computers to factorize, but which a
quantum computer could.

[Building quantum computers is a very heavy lift.]{.underline} They
require hugely expensive infrastructure to stabilize the qubits at
temperatures near absolute zero. They also generate high error rates, or
\"quantum noise,\" for which researchers have to compensate. [Developers
are probably years away from the large-scale code-breaking quantum
computer everyone worries about---although once scientists and engineers
start using quantum computers to build the next generation of quantum
computers]{.underline} (since modeling complex systems like themselves
is one of their strengths) [the timeline could quickly
shorten.]{.underline}

[[Beijing]{.mark} is America\'s chief quantum-computing
rival]{.underline}. It spends at least \$2.5 billion a year on
research---more than 10 times what Washington spends---and has a massive
quantum center in Hefei province. [China [aspires to develop the]{.mark}
code-breaking [**\"killer app,\"**]{.mark} which means
[**protecting**]{.mark} U.S. data and networks [from **quantum
intrusion** is]{.mark} a **[vital]{.mark}** security
interest.]{.underline}

Congress enacted the National Quantum Initiative Act late last year,
which commits an additional \$1.25 billion over five years---still a
fraction of China\'s effort. In addition to more money, [the U.S.
needs]{.underline} a three-phase national-security strategy [to protect
and defend American data, networks and infrastructure from future
quantum attack.]{.underline}

First, dramatically increase efforts to develop encryption methods based
on algorithms large and complex enough to foil quantum intrusion. The
National Institute of Standards and Technology is working to set a
comprehensive standard for these quantum-resistant algorithms so they
can be deployed by 2024, but companies in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere
are already building algorithms and other protective tools.

Second, use quantum technology itself to create the \"unhackable\"
networks of the future. The same particles that make quantum computing
possible can provide randomized and unhackable keys for encrypted
transmissions, in the form of quantum random number generators and
quantum key distribution, a method of securing information shared
between two parties. Dismissed as a fantasy a few years ago, quantum
cryptography has spawned companies in the U.S., Switzerland, South Korea
and Australia, which are deploying the first components of a new
quantum-based information-technology infrastructure. Eventually this
will include satellites using quantum keys to transmit encrypted data.

Here again China has moved quickly. It launched the world\'s first
quantum satellite in 2016 and shocked the world by creating a
quantum-encrypted intercontinental video link from space to a
China-Austria study group in Vienna. China has also created a 1,263-mile
ground link between Beijing and Shanghai using quantum-encrypted keys
between relay stations, which offers an ultrasecure network for
transmitting sensitive data, including for China\'s military and
intelligence services.

Third, require that all U.S. data and networks, including future 5G
technology, be made secure from quantum attack while devoting resources
to build [the [**hack-proof** quantum]{.mark} communication

2\. Communication

[[Communication between the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
Russia]{.mark} is [at an all-time low]{.mark} since the end of the Cold
War, [yet]{.mark} it is a [critical]{.mark} element in the framework of
[deterrence]{.mark}, especially [at the sub-conventional level]{.mark},
where the cost of action is low and attribution is difficult. An
effective deterrence strategy [relies on]{.mark} Washington's
re-establishing [consistent communication]{.mark} avenues [with
Moscow]{.mark}. These [avenues]{.mark} must include both strategic and
sustained communication]{.underline}, each of which has formal and
informal components. [Effective communication [allows the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [to employ]{.mark}]{.underline} a dual-pronged deterrent
strategy utilizing [deterrence by [denial and]{.mark} deterrence by
[punishment]{.mark}]{.underline} through focusing its punitive efforts
on key gray zone actions [while [reserving resources for]{.mark} denial
efforts, such as [resiliency and info]{.mark}rmation
[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}.]{.underline} Douglas Lute explains,
["[It's not enough for the U.S. to have]{.mark} these [threats and
believe them]{.mark}; in fact, [that has no deterrent effect. The
critical thing]{.mark} is to [communicate them in a clear, unambiguous,
and consistent way with Russia]{.mark}."]{.underline}261 [U.S. threats
will not be credible if they promise an escalation that Russia is not
likely to believe.]{.underline}262 [[Identifying gray zone activities
that the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will not tolerate and

[cred]{.mark}ibility of the punitive threat assigned to those

a\. Formal Diplomacy

[[Formal diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark} between the United States and
the Soviet Union, and now Russia, [has been [a stabilizing force]{.mark}
in the bilateral relationship]{.underline} since the Cold War
[and]{.underline}, furthermore, [has contributed to the safety and
security of the international security environment. [Treaties and
c]{.mark}onfidence-[b]{.mark}uilding [m]{.mark}easure[s]{.mark} that
modify behavior [set the standard for how states]{.mark} conduct
business, and [develop trust]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Open Skies
Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and arms control have been
staples of the U.S.--Russian relationship. [While some diplomatic
measures are still in place]{.underline}, or followed even if they have
not been ratified, [the [erosion of formal diplomacy]{.mark} in recent
years has [reduced]{.mark} the [trust]{.mark} and communication between
the United States and Russia, [causing a destabilizing effect on
deterrence]{.mark}, specifically [in the sub-conventional
level.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[To deter Russian gray zone aggression]{.mark}, many subject matter
experts suggest [reinvigorat]{.mark}ing [efforts to extend New
START]{.mark}]{.underline}. The treaty between the United States and
Russia, which entered into force in February 2011, sets "measures for
the further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms."283
[[The treaty also provides c]{.mark}onfidence[b]{.mark}uilding
[m]{.mark}easure[s]{.mark} [that encourage transparency]{.mark} such as
[on-site inspections, data exchanges, notifications]{.mark}, and the
exchange of predicted yearly numbers of ballistic missiles]{.underline}
(both sea and land based).284 Panetta suggests, "[[The U.S.
should]{.mark} not only [reignite interest]{.mark} in extending the New
START treaty, but also [in developing an improved agreement]{.mark} for
the future, one [that]{.mark} possibly [includes]{.mark} the
[cyber]{.mark} domain [and future weapons.]{.mark}"]{.underline}285
Since the dissolution of the INF in 2019, [the bilateral New START is
the last remaining formal arms control measure between the United States
and Russia and is key in keeping formal diplomatic relations
afloat.]{.underline}

A. NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR A DETERRENT STRATEGY

[[A necessary condition for deterrent success]{.mark} that is specific
to the sub-conventional level and the current security environment is a
shift in the deterrence mindset away from zero tolerance of deterrence
failure toward a cumulative deterrence posture that focuses on
maintaining overarching credibility via tailored responses to targeted
gray zone activities when deterrence and denial fail.]{.underline}
Additionally, [for any deterrent strategy to be applied, [the
foundational conditions]{.mark} of deterrence [must be in place]{.mark},
including [communication and diplomacy to provide assurances and
alternate options]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[to an
adversary]{.underline}. Leon Panetta asserts, ["[Communication with
adversaries is imperative]{.mark} to have. It [serves to forward human
relationships]{.mark} that are [critical]{.mark} in the ability [to
create dialogue and keep open lines]{.mark} of
communication."]{.underline}255 Since the end of the Cold War, [[these
conditions]{.mark} have [deteriorated]{.mark} between the United States
and Russia, and [restoring them is essential.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[Comm Plank\-\--Solvency\-\--Accidents]{.underline}**

**Hotlines solve accidents**

[In addition to diplomatic and military communication, [communication
during a crisis is critical]{.mark} in the maintenance of a deterrent
posture. Just after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the United States and the
Soviet Union]{.underline} signed a 1963 memorandum of understanding that
[established a direct link between the two states. The
"[hotline]{.mark},"]{.underline} as it was called, [was "[a
quick]{.mark} communication [link]{.mark} between heads of states . . .
designed [to reduce the danger of an accident, miscalc]{.mark}ulation
[or]{.mark} a [surprise]{.mark} attack]{.underline}."275 The hotline
[was used multiple times throughout history]{.underline} and has since
been transitioned to the Nuclear Risk Reduction Center, where its role
has been expanded to include providing an communication between the
United States and Russia for "the exchange of notifications under
treaties, goodwill notifications, and for emergency communication during
a major fire in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow."276 [Although the hotline
was established to prevent crisis and escalation to nuclear war, it has
proven an effective means of communication during both crisis and
stability between Washington and Moscow.]{.underline} Robert Gates,
former CIA director and defense secretary, stated that [the hotline is a
critical tool "as long as these two sides have submarines roaming the
oceans and missiles pointed at each other]{.underline}."277

[In [today]{.mark}'s context, [where most]{.mark} of the
[conflict]{.mark} between great powers [is]{.mark} conducted [below the
level]{.mark} of conflict [for which the hotline was created]{.mark},
the hotline's [utility can be expanded]{.mark} as a tool [to
re-establish]{.mark} communication [and broaden communication to
include]{.mark} immediate [gray zone issues. Considering the increased
risk of miscalc]{.mark}ulation based on the current lack of
communication [and]{.mark} the [ability for gray zone
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} [to escalate]{.mark}, a crisis [hotline
is]{.mark} a rational and [effective]{.mark} communication avenue that
is [already established and can be immediately utilized to kick-start
communication]{.mark}]{.underline}. The communication can even start
within the parameters of the existing framework of the NRC to encourage
discourse and submit proposals or grievances over the extension of New
START.

[[Despite]{.mark} the [plummeting]{.mark} political [relations]{.mark}
between the United States and Russia, [military communication]{.mark}
has [remained]{.mark}, even if in a limited fashion. Military contact
has served as [a mainstay]{.mark} of communication]{.underline} between
the states since 2014 and the expulsion of many Russian diplomats. [[At
the top levels of]{.mark} military [leadership]{.mark}, the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army General Mark Milley, and the
Russian chief of the General Staff, General Valery Gerasimov, continue a
limited but regular dialogue]{.underline}. Ulrich Kühn argues, ["[NATO
should]{.mark}]{.underline} aim to [[re-establish]{.mark} . . .
[comm]{.mark}unication[s]{.mark} channels with the Russian General Staff
[at the working level]{.mark}]{.underline}."273 [The top-level
interaction is]{.underline} a [positive]{.underline} foothold in
U.S.--Russian communication; [however, [more frequent communication is
needed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Recently, the interaction between the top
levels has increased, including a physical meeting in Switzerland "aimed
at increasing communication between their nations to reduce risks in
conflict areas."274 [[Efforts are in place]{.mark} to improve military
communication [and could be enhanced]{.mark} through the replacement of
the Russian liaison at SHAPE and by]{.underline} acting on Kühn's
suggestion of [re-establishing working-level military communication.
These [improvements]{.mark} to military communication [could set the
framework of positive relations]{.mark} between the states [to usher in
future consistent diplomatic communication]{.mark}, which is crucial for
deterrence.]{.underline}

3\. Diplomacy

Through diplomacy, it is possible for the United States and Russia to
build lasting cooperation through formal agreements, mutual interests,
and established codes of conduct. This section explores both formal and
informal diplomacy followed by a discussion of U.S. and Russian common
interests detailing specific categories in which diplomacy could be
renewed. However, diplomacy must be a first-line option supported by
credible threats of denial and punishment. Anthony Cordesman explains,
"The one thing that you cannot do is use diplomacy as a substitute for
countermeasures."278 It is critical to recognize that [[every effort
spent toward diplomacy]{.mark} can help stabilize U.S.--Russian
relations [at the nuclear and conventional leve]{.mark}l. Improved
stability at these levels [can alleviate tension]{.mark} and reveal
where instability is still present [at the sub-conventional
level.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Washington must operate from a place of strength to affect Putin's
cost--benefit analysis]{.mark} through deterrence by denial, supported
by punishment, [while also giving him a diplomatic
alternative]{.mark}.]{.underline} Brad Roberts explains that during his
time with the Obama administration, [it was clear that "President [Putin
concluded]{.mark} that there was a fundamental [conflict]{.mark} of
interest with the United States, that it [was a zero-sum
game.]{.mark}]{.underline} The U.S. was pursuing interests against
Russia that were simply unacceptable to President Putin, and as such, he
reconceived a relationship of enduring conflict."279 As described in
earlier chapters, [the United States attempted to demonstrate that Putin
had taken too dark a view of American interests and through diplomatic
opportunities sought to pursue mutual interests and pragmatic
cooperation in various areas; however, the efforts failed.]{.underline}
Roberts explains that [[this]{.mark} conflictual relationship [does not
have to be inevitable:]{.mark} "It is a matter of political calculus
emanating from a particular person at a particular
time."]{.underline}280 This would suggest that [to restore diplomatic
cooperation with Russia, [Putin's decision calculus must be]{.mark}
[influenced]{.mark} to convince him that it is in his best
interest.]{.underline}

Cordesman illustrates that ["the U.S. tends to deal with Russia in terms
of the sticks and often does not have a well-defined set of
carrots."]{.underline}281 Cordesman goes on to explain that [a necessary
addition is "offering a well-defined alternative in terms of cooperation
where the U.S. and Russia both benefit."]{.underline}282 [Operating a
deterrent strategy solely on punishment threats is dangerous because,
although it is imperative to signal to Russia that there are penalties
for misbehavior, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must]{.mark} also
[signal assurance for compliance]{.mark}. With established
communication, [diplomacy will]{.mark} facilitate not only that
acceptable alternative but also aspire to [build]{.mark} formal and
informal [agreements that bound]{.mark} sub-conventional conflict[,
decrease]{.mark} the [risk or escalation, and provide insight
toward]{.mark} an adversary's [intent]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[New START Plank\-\--AT: Fails/Won't Happen]{.underline}**

**Even if New START isn't extended, the CP still solves gray zone
deterrence by spurring future agreements, correcting misperceptions, and
avoiding accidents\-\--the unilateral commitment is sufficient**

Whitney L. **Cissell 20**, MA thesis in Security Studies, Naval
Postgraduate School, Army Major, Nuclear Nonproliferation Officer, March
2020, \"DETERRENCE IN THE DANGER ZONE: HOW THE UNITED STATES CAN DETER
RUSSIAN GRAY ZONE CONFLICT\", https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/64844

[[Even if New START is not extended, discussions]{.mark} over the
treaty's contents [could]{.mark} be used to [spur]{.mark} discussion on
[a]{.mark} new arms control treaty or]{.underline}, at the very least,
[a [broader]{.mark} discussion and [effort toward]{.mark} multilateral
[arms control]{.mark}]{.underline}. Kühn explains that [discussions
about arms control are "particularly important since the strategic
nuclear dialogue between Washington and Moscow effectively petered out
after the New START entered into force]{.underline} in 2011."286 Kühn
suggests, "[Reconvening NATO--Russian talks about military strategy and
nuclear doctrine]{.underline}, which had been ongoing prior to Russia's
annexation of Crimea, [could help [dispel misperceptions and]{.mark}
thus [avoid]{.mark} inadvertent [escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline}"287
[As the timetested formula for risk reduction is deterrence plus
diplomacy]{.underline}, Kühn's suggestion to reconvene [NATO--Russian
communication, combined with U.S.--Russian efforts toward New
START]{.underline} or a similar treaty, [would likely bolster deterrence
of the gray zone.]{.underline}

[These efforts]{.underline} to reinstate formal diplomacy [would
emphasize the U.S. resolve toward diplomacy and simultaneously [signal
to Russia]{.mark} that [the use]{.mark} or threat [of]{.mark} tactical
[nuclear weapons]{.mark} [is not in its interest]{.mark}]{.underline} as
a state.288 By addressing the unacceptable use of tactical nuclear
weapons in the context of arms control, [Washington has a forum to
address the issue while it [reaffirm]{.mark}s [the]{.mark} nuclear
[taboo]{.mark} and communicates to Moscow that any use of a nuclear
weapon will be met with grave U.S. and international consequences. This
reaffirmation of non-use [drives]{.mark} the U.S.--Russian
[conflict]{.mark} back [to the sub-conventional level]{.mark}, [allowing
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to focus]{.mark} resources and
diplomacy efforts [on the gray zone.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In a situation where the United States and Russia do not extend New
START, formal [diplomacy could be achieved through]{.mark} a
[unilateral]{.mark} approach. To show [commitment]{.mark} and a
willingness for diplomacy, the United States could make a public
commitment to data exchanges and inspections in line with what would
have occurred if New START had been extended. The United States could
also make a public commitment to maintaining the [limited]{.mark} number
of [weapons designated by New START.]{.mark} These commitments [would
foster an environment ripe for]{.mark} continued formal negotiations of
[a future]{.mark} arms [agreement]{.mark} between the United States and
Russia as well as open the path to informal diplomacy between the
states.]{.underline}

The Limited Escalation Risks of Cyber Operations

But all of this [[focus on cyber op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} causing
nuclear escalation may be]{.underline}
**[[misplaced]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, more
importantly, **[[distract policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the
dangers of a more plausible scenario: the use of ambiguous cyber signals
during nuclear crises. Specifically[, [the nature of
cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} [operations **[reduces the]{.mark}ir
[inherent escalatory potential]{.mark}**, particularly when compared to
other ways a state could attack an adversary's nuclear forces or
command, control, and communications systems, like a **direct
counterforce strike**]{.underline} [or employing]{.underline}
**[a]{.underline}**nti-**[sat]{.underline}**ellite
weapon**[s]{.underline}**. But their misuse as a signaling tool could do
more harm than good.

First, [[successfully]{.mark} [conducting]{.mark} [cyber]{.mark}
operations against strategic targets]{.underline}, like nuclear systems,
[[is]{.underline} **[hard]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[er]{.underline}**
[than]{.underline} the [**conventional wisdom might suggest**. It
requires a means of gaining]{.underline} **[access]{.underline}** [to
a]{.underline} **[particular system]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[developing an exploit]{.underline}** to cause a desired effect ---
[and then maintaining **persistent**]{.underline} (and
**[stealthy]{.underline}**) **[access]{.underline}** [to be able to
conduct an offensive operation at the desired **time**]{.underline}.
Moreover, [[the overall]{.underline} **[outcome]{.underline}** [may be
**unpredictable**]{.underline}]{.mark} and net less-than-desirable
results.

Second, [even if a state is]{.underline} **[able]{.underline}** [to
conduct these kinds of operations, they typically
**prefer**]{.underline} [to do so in]{.underline}
**[secret]{.underline}** --- and [this]{.underline}
**[mitigates]{.underline}** some **[escalation concerns]{.underline}**.
That's because, [to cause an escalatory response, a state like Russia
would have to]{.underline} **[uncover]{.underline}** [a cyber operation
during a]{.underline} **[particular time period]{.underline}** --- such
as while the Ukraine conflict is unfolding. For example, [Russia would
have to detect a cyber operation against a nuclear command and control
system to cause Putin to **perceive a "window of
vulnerability,"**]{.underline} perhaps assessing that it is part of a
U.S. or NATO counterforce strategy to disable Russia's ability to
retaliate with nuclear weapons. But [the]{.underline}
**[likelihood]{.underline}** [of these circumstances arising
is]{.underline} **[low]{.underline}** [because --- unless a state is
trying to]{.underline} **[signal]{.underline}** with a cyber capability
--- [it will]{.underline} try to **[keep these kinds of]{.underline}**
sensitive [**operations secret**. Therefore, the chances of such an
operation being]{.underline} **[discovered]{.underline}** [at a
particular time period are]{.underline} relatively
**[small]{.underline}**.

Finally, [even if, hypothetically, Russia]{.underline}
**[was]{.underline}** [to discover a cyber operation taking place, the
likelihood of it]{.underline} **[leading to escalation]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} **[low]{.underline}**. This is [due to the]{.underline}
**[virtual nature]{.underline}** [of [cyber]{.mark} "weapons" --- they
**[rarely cause destruction in the physical world]{.mark}**, let alone
permanent damage]{.underline}. For example, even Russia's 2015 cyber
attack against Ukraine's power grid, an important example of a strategic
cyber attack against civilian critical infrastructure, only resulted in
service disruptions for a few hours. During the current conflict,
Russia-linked actors have so far been stymied in using cyber operations
for strategic impact, such as the failed cyber attack by the group
Sandworm against Ukraine's power grid.

Taken together, this reasoning suggests that, [in]{.underline}
[**practice**, cyber operations may not rise to a level that would cause
a state like Russia to actually fear the **integrity** of its nuclear
command, control, and communications systems, creating **few reasons**
to escalate to the level of nuclear **employment**]{.underline}.

The Flipside of Deterrence by Punishment -- the Fear of Escalation

[[One]{.mark} of the]{.underline} greatest [**[reservation]{.mark}**s
against communicating a willingness to take punitive actions
[concerns]{.mark} the [risk of **escalation**]{.mark} and increased
tension due to a more assertive]{.underline} or offensive [posture.
[Yet]{.mark} when looking into possible responses -- retaliation [in
**cyber**]{.mark}space, for example -- a number of [**"self-dampening"
mechanisms** appear]{.mark} to be **[in place]{.mark}** that may be
**applicable** to many types of responses]{.underline}.30 [[One]{.mark}
example [is]{.mark} the requirement to establish]{.underline} some level
of **[[attribution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of aggression on which to base
a response. As discussed above, while attribution is rarely impossible,
[it can be a time-consuming and technically-challenging endeavor. In a
high-stakes scenario the **time** taken]{.underline} to get attribution
as right as possible [means [there will be **plenty of time** to **think
twice**]{.mark} about actions and consequences, [and]{.mark} to **[lean
on diplomatic measures]{.mark}** in **parallel**. [An example]{.mark} of
a self-dampening mechanism [related to]{.mark} the **[cyber]{.mark}**
domain [is]{.mark} the **[large investment]{.mark}** required to develop
credible offensive capabilities. Moreover, an offensive cyber capability
is a **transitory tool**]{.underline}31. [The ability to access a
computer system or network to cause harm or damage is **only temporary**
and **dependent** on a **very rapid and ongoing patching** of
vulnerabilities]{.underline}. At the same time, wielding the cyber
instrument despite the downside of "burning" the capacity might have a
de-escalatory effect by communicating capability and credibility to the
opponent with a view to discouraging future hostile attacks.
[[Targeting]{.mark} in any domain]{.underline} -- including cyberspace
-- [[must]{.mark} also [follow]{.mark} **relevant
[rules]{.mark}**]{.underline}, law and due-process [[which]{.mark} will
**[self-limit]{.mark}** the **range** of **[targets]{.mark}** and
**actions** available.]{.underline}

[[A]{.mark} final [**"escalatory showstopper"** is]{.mark} related to
the challenge of **identifying** and **developing targets** of adequate
strategic significance -- **not too much, not too little** -- to achieve
the desired effect. Responding to hybrid aggression by applying "middle
range" punitive [actions]{.mark} that are **[proportionate]{.mark}** to
the aggression threatened or suffered [will]{.mark} also
**[self-limit]{.mark}** the escalatory potential. [It is
**unlikely**]{.mark} to be [in the **interest** of **any**]{.mark}
hybrid aggressor [to pursue **a**]{.mark}n **escalatory
[spiral]{.mark}** above and beyond where they were looking to compete in
the first place: on the hybrid level]{.underline}. Nevertheless, one way
to mitigate the risk of escalation -- while enhancing civilian oversight
and interagency coordination -- would be to establish rules of
engagement for punitive actions on the hybrid level32 . This would
provide decision-makers with common guidelines to pursue punitive
actions that fall below the "use of force threshold". Moreover, this
could actually bolster the credibility of punitive actions by signaling
to hybrid aggressors the intent to take pre-prepared punitive actions
when deemed necessary: in other words, a "playbook" for countering
hybrid threats.

[In a world of rapid socio-technical transformation and increasing
fragmentation of political power and authority, cyber security has
firmly established itself as one of the]{.underline} **[top national
security issues]{.underline}** of the 21st century. [Managing cyber
insecurities will]{.underline} most [likely]{.underline} **[further
increase]{.underline}** in **[complexity]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[political significance]{.underline}** [in the next
decade]{.underline}, co-produced by an acceleration of the ongoing
socio-technical transformations, on the one hand, and the changing
dynamics of the related political responses, on the other. The first
part of the book recorded the ongoing geographic expansion of cyberspace
into outer space, anticipated how emerging technologies will increase
the interconnectedness of infrastructures and services, and projected
how in a context of ever tighter coupled and integrated socio-technical
systems cyber threat narratives will inevitably expand to more policy
fields at both the national and international levels. The second part of
the book discussed how in cyberspace state actors need to find the right
balance between restraint and exploitation, why they need to uphold
their efforts to control the risk of escalation, and why governments
increasingly share responsibility with actors from economy and society.

The current state of cyber security politics is very much a reflection
of the interplay between the underlying forces of great power
competition and the dynamics of socio-technical and socio-economic
globalization processes. From the interplay of these two processes
emerge the two key factors -- multidimensional uncertainty and
socio-political ambiguity -- that characterize the current context of
cyber security politics at both the national and international levels,
as highlighted in Figure 16.1. Multidimensional uncertainty plays a key
role in the emergence of cyber insecurity as a wicked problem and shapes
-- and is shaped by -- the ambiguity of cyber security politics.

The ambiguity of cyber security politics encompasses the two dimensions
of cyber security outlined in the introductory chapter (Dunn Cavelty and
Wenger 2022): First, the international dimension of cyber security
politics concentrates on how state actors shape and use cyberspace in
accordance with their strategic goals, while at the same time struggling
to uphold the stability of their strategic relationships. In Figure
16.1, the interactive search for an acceptable balance between

\[FIGURE 16.1 OMITTED\]

the strategic utility of and the strategic stability in cyberspace is
represented in the upper left (possibilities of (geo)political (mis)use)
and lower right (conflictive / cooperative government responses)
corners. Second, the broader dimension of cyber security politics
focuses on how state, industry, and societies negotiate their respective
roles in governing cyberspace, while at the same time competing in the
tech innovation process that affects the continued transformation of
cyberspace. In Figure 16.1, the interactive search for norms of
responsible behavior in an uncertain and ambiguous socio-technical and
sociopolitical context is represented in the lower left (fragmented
trans-sectoral/transnational governance responses) and upper right
(emerging digital technologies) corners.

This concluding chapter, building on the individual contributions to
this book, highlights four key debates that together encapsulate the
complexities and paradoxes of the current thinking about the future of
cyber security politics from a Western perspective. The first section
asks how much political influence states can achieve via cyber
operations and what context factors condition the (limited) strategic
utility of such operations. A second section discusses the role of
emerging digital technologies in cyber security politics and notes how
the dynamics of the tech innovation process reinforce the fragmentation
of the governance space around them. A third section asks how states
attempt to uphold stability in cyberspace, and in their strategic
relations more general, highlighting three interconnected challenges --
escalation, deterrence, and intelligence -- of this interactive quest. A
fourth and final section focuses on the shared responsibility of state,
economy, and society for cyber security and calls attention to the
continuing renegotiation processes about their respective roles in an
increasingly trans-sectoral and transnational governance space.

The strategic utility of cyber operations

The debate about the strategic utility of cyber operations arises in a
context characterized by the interplay between the rapid emergence of
new digital technologies and the politics of their use and misuse. Over
time, [the debate **evolved considerably**, as cyber]{.underline}
[security issues transformed from]{.underline} a **[technical risk
management issue]{.underline}** [discussed by]{.underline} a
**[limited]{.underline}** circle of **[experts]{.underline}** [into a
**key challenge of national security**]{.underline} [debated at
the]{.underline} **[highest level]{.underline}** of governments (Dunn
Cavelty 2008; Dewar 2018). [In its early stages, the debate focused on
**"doomsday"**]{.underline} [cyberattack scenarios that centered on the
**strategic exploitation**]{.underline} [of increasingly interconnected
and vulnerable infrastructures]{.underline} (Clarke and Knake 2010). [As
**out-of-the-blue cyber war**]{.underline} [failed to make
its]{.underline} [**expected appearance**, experts began to
shift]{.underline} their [attention to]{.underline} the political and
strategic implications of **[low-level]{.underline}** cyber
[conflict]{.underline} (Baezner 2018; see also Rid 2012; Lindsay
2014/15), on the one hand, and to the increase of computer network
attack campaigns linked to covert state involvement (Dunn Cavelty 2015),
on the other.

[At the current point]{.underline} in time in the history of cyber
security politics [the]{.underline} **[empirical]{.underline}** [picture
is characterized]{.underline} [by]{.underline} **["dogs that did not
bark"]{.underline}** [at the]{.underline} **[high end]{.underline}** [of
conflict and]{.underline} **[persistent cyber operations]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[instability]{.underline}** [at the]{.underline}
**[low end]{.underline}** of conflict (Schulze 2020; Harknett and Smeets
2020; Lupovici 2021). Within this context, the chapters in this volume
point to three interconnected aspects of the enduring debate about the
strategic utility of cyber operations: A first subsection concentrates
on the difficulty of achieving a controlled strategic effect under
multidimensional uncertainty. The focus here is on explaining why most
cyber operations so far seem not very escalatory and appear unlikely to
result in visible changes in the existing balance of power between great
powers. A second subsection focuses on the utility of cyber operations
as a tool of subversion and mild sabotage. Here the focus is on
understanding how the ambiguity of involved actors and the opaqueness of
cyber operations can be manipulated in specific strategic contexts by
some powers for asymmetric influence. A third subsection deals with the
assumed asymmetrical vulnerability of democracies to disinformation as
the latest cyber threat focus in Western (security) politics. Here the
debate centers on the question if a strategic effect can be achieved via
cyber influence operations that aim at undermining social cohesion and
trust in democratic political institutions.

#### Gray zone cyber conflict won't escalate

The power to subvert: manipulating "gray zones" while minimizing the
risk of escalation

[Most cyber operations take place **below the threshold of
war**]{.underline}, Marie Baezner and Sean Cordey (2022) note in their
chapter. Mapping the practical use of such operations in a series of
cyber conflict case studies, they confirm that especially influence
operations fall into a zone which goes beyond conventional diplomacy and
stops short of conventional war, which Lucas Kello describes as
"unpeace" (Kello 2017). Taking this empirical puzzle as a starting point
for their analysis, the chapter asks why some actors see such operations
as attractive and efficient tools of power projection and influence.
[The]{.underline} ([limited]{.underline}) [strategic utility of
cyber]{.underline} (influence) [operations]{.underline}, the two authors
conclude, [**depends** on the characteristics of the **strategic
context** and the **operational environment**]{.underline} in which they
are employed and on the nature of the strategic actor employing such
operations.

[At a **strategic** level, the increasingly pervasive use of
cyber]{.underline} (influence) [operations in international affairs
reflects the current dynamics of great power competition]{.underline}.
Together, the [increasing costs of **conventional** war and the
realities of economic interdependence create incentives, especially for
**great powers**, to gain **asymmetric influence** through cyber
operations, in particular in their spheres of interest,
without]{.underline} however [unduly undermining the **strategic
stability** of great power relations. At an **operational** level, the
use of **cyber influence op**]{.underline}eration[**s** reflects an
operational environment that is characterized by **legal ambiguity** and
**political contestation**, **opacity** of the **parties** involved and
blurred boundaries between the private and public domains. Referring to
the concept of and literature on "gray zones",]{.underline} Baezner and
Cordey argue that [revisionist powers use cyber operations as tools to
operate **below the threshold of armed combat** to gain an asymmetric
advantage in their relationship with other political actors, especially
in view of the global]{.underline} (military) [dominance of the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.

Based on a series of case studies, Baezner and Cordey note that the
following operational assumptions about cyber (influence) operations
seem to make them attractive tools for many to intervene in gray zone
conflicts. First, the majority of the cyber technologies used in such
contexts are widely available at relatively low cost. Patriotic hackers
or opaque criminal groups with ties to domestic or foreign elites use
them opportunistically for disruption and mild sabotage rather than for
destruction. Second, cyber espionage and influence operations are
increasingly used to influence the information environment of a conflict
and gain an asymmetric advantage. They work in tandem with a wider set
of economic, political, and military coercive tools. Third,
[the]{.underline} **[legal uncertainty]{.underline}** [surrounding
intelligence operations allows state actors to **avoid formal
condemnation**]{.underline} [and uphold a posture of]{.underline}
[**plausible deniability**. The opaqueness of actors and operations
makes it unlikely that a **verdict of attribution**]{.underline} [would
be]{.underline} as **[transparent]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[credible]{.underline}** as to justify a military response.

#### It [doesn't]{.underline} spill [out]{.underline} to cross-domain [kinetic]{.underline} force AND is [limited]{.underline} to [just]{.underline} stop intrusions

Institute at the United States Military Academy at West Point, and Shawn

Tools of Escalation", Strategic Studies Quarterly, Fall 2019, p. 123-124

However, [there are **important empirical reasons** to suspect that the
[risks of cyber escalation may be **exaggerated**]{.mark}. Specifically,
if cyberspace is in fact an environment that]{.underline} (perhaps even
more so than others) [generates severe escalation risks, [why
has]{.mark} cyber [escalation **not yet occurred**? Most]{.mark}
interactions between cyber rivals [have been]{.mark} characterized by
**[limited volleys]{.mark}** that have **[not]{.mark} escalated**
[beyond **nuisance levels**]{.mark} and have been largely [**contained**
below]{.mark} the [use-of-force]{.mark} threshold]{.underline}.5 For
example, in [a survey]{.underline} of cyber incidents and responses
between 2000 and 2014, Brandon Valeriano et al. [find that
"[rivals]{.mark}]{.underline} tend to [[respond only to
**lower-level**]{.mark} \[cyber\] [incidents an]{.mark}d the response
tends to **[check]{.mark} the [intrusion]{.mark}** as [opposed to seek
**escalation dominance**]{.mark}. The majority of cyber escalation
episodes are at a **low severity threshold** and are **non-escalatory**.
These incidents are usually **['tit-for- tat']{.mark}** type responses
[**within one step** of the]{.mark} original
[incident]{.mark}."]{.underline}6 [[Even in]{.mark} the **two [rare
examples]{.mark}** in which states [employed kinetic
force]{.mark}]{.underline} in response to adversary cyber
operations---the US counter-ISIL drone campaign in 2015 and Israel's
airstrike against Hamas cyber operatives in 2019---[the use of [force
was **circumscribed**]{.mark} and did **not escalate** the overall
conflict]{.underline} (not to mention that force was used against
nonstate adversaries with limited potential to meaningfully escalate in
response to US or Israeli force).7

We posit that [cyber escalation has not occurred because cyber
operations are **poor tools** of escalation]{.underline}. In particular,
we argue that [this stems from **key characteristics** of **offensive**
cyber capabilities that **limit escalation** through four mechanisms.
First, **[retal]{.mark}**iatory offensive cyber
**[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** may not exist at the **desired
time** of employment. Second, even under conditions where they may
exist, their [effects are **uncertain** and]{.mark} often relatively
**[limited]{.mark}**. Third, several attributes of offensive cyber
operations generate **important tradeoffs** for decision-makers that may
make them hesitant to employ capabilities in some
circumstances.]{.underline} [Finally, the alternative of
[**cross-domain** escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}---responding to a
cyber incident with noncyber, kinetic instruments---[[is
**unlikely**]{.mark} to be chosen except under **rare** circumstances,
[given]{.mark} the **[limited]{.mark} cost-generation
[potential]{.mark}** of offensive cyber operations]{.underline}. In this
article, we define cyber escalation and then explore the implications of
the technical features and requirements for offensive cyber operations.
We also consider potential alternative or critical responses to each of
these logics. Finally, we evaluate the implications for US policy
making.

[[To date, **no**]{.mark} **direct use**]{.underline} [of [OCO]{.mark}
capabilities has [resulted in]{.mark} the **outbreak** of
traditional]{.underline} **[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**, perhaps
[[owing to **uncertainties**]{.mark} in the **[novelty]{.mark} of the

**[rule of law]{.underline}**, which translates into multiple
authorities to ensure responsible and acceptable use, and safeguard
against escalation. The [fine-grained [control]{.mark} of

more **[controllable]{.mark} costs**]{.underline} on the adversary, with
the benefit of plausible deniability (Hare, 2018). [Depending on the
type of OCO employed, if there is a reduction in tension, the effects of

Stabilising or Not

Dissimulation is an essential part of hybrid warfare, and Europe and the
US face a **[[propaganda]{.underline}]{.mark}** barrage that is much
more sophisticated than the clumsy Soviet efforts of the Cold War.
Despite this clumsiness, [a good portion of the Western public has found
it persuasive]{.underline}. Similarly, [those critical of NATO will find
new complaints about aggression]{.underline} and militarisation
[credible. Russia has already complained that [NATO's]{.mark} defensive
[cyber doctrine is destabilising]{.mark} warmongering]{.underline} and
part of a larger conspiracy to advance western hegemony.11 The Snowden
revelations have lent a powerful impetus to Russian propaganda.

[[Behind the **rhetoric** lies]{.mark} both [a desire to **conceal their
own**]{.mark} use of **[cyber op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} a real **[fear]{.mark}** that [Russia's]{.mark} decline
leaves it [**vulnerable**]{.mark} to new military technologies. [The
intent]{.mark} is to **[hamper]{.mark}** and complicate any **[Western
response]{.mark}** to Russian efforts]{.underline} to regain control in
Crimea and the "near abroad". The Russian position is that NATO's new
cyber doctrine is destabilising as it threatens to use conventional or
even nuclear responses (in the Russian description of the new policy
towards low-level cyber attacks).

[[**Any announcement**]{.mark} by NATO [relating to **offensive
cyber**]{.mark} capabilities [would be greeted with **alarm**]{.mark}
and vitriol in Moscow. [However, the effect on **stability**
would]{.mark} likely [be **less pronounced**]{.mark}. NATO-Russia
relations are already in steep decline. It is possible that any NATO
announcement would accelerate this, but it is also possible that [Russia
could **recalculate**]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark} of further adventures
[if]{.mark} it were [faced with a **stronger
defence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In terms of opponent attitudes, there is
probably little effect. Russia, along with NATO's other potential
military opponents, is likely to overestimate both capabilities and
coordination among NATO member states and underestimate NATO's will to
defend. This is an unhappy combination as it makes aggression against
NATO seem less risky.

[[NATO's decision]{.mark} on how [**cyber attacks could trigger Article
5**,]{.mark} while greeted with complaints, [had a **stabilising
effect**.]{.mark} It made clear to potential opponents that [cyber
attacks are **not risk-free**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Similarly, [a clear
enunciation of how [NATO]{.mark} would use [offensive cyber]{.mark}
capabilities]{.underline} as part of any defensive operation
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[change opponents' risk
calc]{.mark}**ulations in ways that would force them to consider how
offensive actions]{.underline}, even if intended to be covert, [are not
free of risk or cost.]{.underline}

### No Russian Cyber\-\--1NC

#### Russia won't launch catastrophic cyber attacks

James Andrew **Lewis 20**, Senior Vice President and Director of the
Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, "Dismissing Cyber Catastrophe", Center for Strategic and
International Studies, 8/17/2020,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/dismissing-cyber-catastrophe

A catastrophic cyberattack was first predicted in the mid-1990s. Since
then, predictions of a catastrophe have appeared regularly and have
entered the popular consciousness. As a trope, [a [cyber
catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline} captures our imagination, but as
analysis, it [[remains **entirely imaginary**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
is of dubious value as a basis for policymaking. There has never been a
catastrophic cyberattack.

To qualify as a catastrophe, an event must produce damaging mass effect,
including casualties and destruction. The fires that swept across
California last summer were a catastrophe. Covid-19 has been a
catastrophe, especially in countries with inadequate responses. With
man-made actions, however, a catastrophe is harder to produce than it
may seem, and for cyberattacks a catastrophe requires organizational and
technical skills most actors still do not possess. It requires planning,
reconnaissance to find vulnerabilities, and then acquiring or building
attack tools---things that require resources and experience. [To achieve
mass effect]{.underline}, either [a few]{.underline} central [targets
(like an electrical grid) need to be hit]{.underline} or multiple
targets would have to be hit simultaneously (as is the case with urban
water systems), something that is itself an operational challenge.

[It is easier to imagine a catastrophe than to produce it. The
20**[03]{.mark}**]{.underline} East Coast [[blackout is the
archetype]{.mark} for an attack on the]{.underline} U.S. electrical
[grid. **[No one died]{.mark}**]{.underline} in this blackout, [and
[services]{.mark} were [**restored** in]{.mark} a **few [days]{.mark}**.
As electric production is digitized, vulnerability increases, but many
electrical [companies]{.mark} have [made]{.mark}
**cybers[ecurity]{.mark}** [a **priority**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Similarly, at water treatment plants, the chemicals used to purify water
are controlled in ways that make mass releases difficult. In any case,
it would take a massive amount of chemicals to poison large rivers or
lakes, more than most companies keep on hand, and any release would
quickly be diluted.

More importantly, [[there are **powerful strategic constraints**]{.mark}
on those who have the ability to launch catastrophe
attacks]{.underline}. We have more than two decades of experience with
the use of cyber techniques and operations for coercive and criminal
purposes and have a clear understanding of motives, capabilities, and
intentions. We can be guided by the methods of the Strategic Bombing
Survey, which used interviews and observation (rather than hypotheses)
to determine effect. These methods apply equally to cyberattacks. The
conclusions we can draw from this are:

- Nonstate actors and most states lack the capability to launch attacks
  that cause physical damage at any level, much less a catastrophe.
  There have been regular predictions every year for over a decade that
  nonstate actors will acquire these high-end cyber capabilities in two
  or three years in what has become a cycle of repetition. The monetary
  return is negligible, which dissuades the skilled cybercriminals
  (mostly Russian speaking) who might have the necessary skills. One
  mystery is why these groups have not been used as mercenaries, and
  this may reflect either a degree of control by [the
  **[Russia]{.mark}**n state]{.underline} (if it [[has
  **forbidden**]{.mark} mercenary [acts]{.mark}]{.underline}) or a
  degree of caution by criminals.

- [[There is **enough uncertainty**]{.mark} among potential attackers
  [about]{.mark} the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates'
  [[ability to **attribute**]{.mark} that [they are **unwilling** to
  risk **massive retal**]{.mark}iation in response to a catastrophic
  attack]{.underline}. (They are perfectly willing to take the risk of
  attribution for espionage and coercive cyber actions.)

- [**No one has ever died** from a cyberattack, and **only a handful**
  of these attacks have produced **physical** damage]{.underline}. A
  cyberattack is not a nuclear weapon, and it is intellectually lazy to
  equate them to nuclear weapons. Using a tactical nuclear weapon
  against an urban center would produce several hundred thousand
  casualties, while a strategic nuclear exchange would cause tens of
  millions of casualties and immense physical destruction. These are
  catastrophes that some hack cannot duplicate. The shadow of nuclear
  war distorts discussion of cyber warfare.

- [[State use]{.mark} of cyber operations is consistent with their
  **broad** national strategies and interests. Their primary emphasis
  [is]{.mark} on [**espionage** and]{.mark} **political
  [coercion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The United States has
  [opponents]{.underline} and is in conflict with them, but they [have
  **[no]{.mark} interest** in launching a **[catastrophic]{.mark}**
  cyber**[attack]{.mark}** since it would certainly produce an equally
  **catastrophic retaliation**. Their [**goal** is]{.mark} to stay
  **[below]{.mark} the ["use-of-force"]{.mark} threshold** and undertake
  damaging cyber actions against the **U**]{.underline}nited
  **[S]{.underline}**tates, [[**not** start]{.mark} a
  **[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This has implications for the discussion of [[**inadvertent**
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}, something that [has]{.underline} also
[[**never** occurred]{.underline}]{.mark}. The concern over escalation
deserves a longer discussion, as there are both technological and
strategic constraints that shape and limit risk in cyber operations, and
[the [absence]{.mark} of inadvertent escalation [suggests]{.mark} a
**[high]{.mark} degree of [control]{.mark}** for cyber capabilities by
advanced states. Attackers]{.underline}, particularly among the United
States' major opponents for whom cyber is just one of the tools for
confrontation, seek to [**avoid** actions that could trigger
escalation]{.underline}.

The United States has two opponents (China and [Russia]{.underline}) who
[are capable of damaging cyberattacks. Russia has demonstrated its
attack skills on the Ukrainian power grid, but [**neither Russia nor
China would be well served** by a]{.mark} similar [attack]{.mark} on the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. Iran is improving and
may reach the point where it could use cyberattacks to cause major
damage, but it would only do so when it has decided to engage in a major
armed conflict with the United States. Iran might attack targets outside
the United States and its allies with less risk and continues to
experiment with cyberattacks against Israeli critical infrastructure.
North Korea has not yet developed this kind of capability.

One major failing of [catastrophe [scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline} is
that they [[discount]{.mark} the **robustness** and
**[resilience]{.mark}** of modern economies. These economies present
[**multiple** targets]{.mark} and configurations; they [are **harder to
damage**]{.mark} through cyberattack than they look, given the
growing]{.underline} (albeit incomplete) [attention to cybersecurity;
and experience shows that [people **compensate**]{.mark} for damage [and
**quickly repair**]{.mark} or rebuild]{.underline}. This was one of the
counterintuitive lessons of the Strategic Bombing Survey. Pre-war
planning assumed that civilian morale and production would crumple under
aerial bombardment. In fact, the opposite occurred. Resistance hardened
and production was restored.1

This is a short overview of why [catastrophe is
**unlikely**]{.underline}. Several longer CSIS reports go into the
reasons in some detail. Past performance may not necessarily predict the
future, but after 25 years without a single catastrophic cyberattack, we
should invoke the concept cautiously, if at all. Why then, it is raised
so often?

On the other hand, [[both]{.mark} states [might not desire]{.mark}
further [escalation]{.mark}, preferring to restrain the conflict to
cyberspace]{.underline}. [Each would follow the "tit-for-tat" logic and
accuse each other]{.underline} **[while [never reaching]{.mark} a
tipping point where the conflict spills over to a [conventional
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Such a tipping point would be linked to the
intensity of the attack or the nature of the targets. [Both [nations
would keep]{.mark} the [cyberattacks **small**]{.mark} enough not to
trigger a bigger reaction. The same would be observed on the choice of
targets, with both avoiding certain critical or sensitive targets, for
instance critical infrastructures.]{.underline} In order to contain the
conflict in cyberspace, both states would have **[[to
demonstrate]{.mark} their [restraint by selecting options with
low]{.mark} risk of [miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}** (Lin, 2012,
pp. 64--66). In the future, [[it might]{.mark} also be possible to
[see]{.mark} a [deescalation in]{.mark} the form of the emergence of an
international treaty or at least further [**bilateral treaties**
between]{.mark} the [USA and Russia]{.mark} on
cyberattacks]{.underline}. For example, during the last few years,
businesses in the USA were often hacked and spied on by the Chinese
military. These intrusions were mostly cyber-economic-espionage and were
said to have supported the theft of billions of dollars' worth of
intellectual property (Bamford, 2016). [In]{.underline} September [2015,
the USA and China signed an agreement engaging both countries not to
support or conduct cyber-theft of intellectual property]{.underline}.
Moreover, the parties have made the commitment not to use cyberattacks
against each other's critical infrastructures in peace-time and to
support the establishment of international behavioral norms in
cyberspace (Rosenfeld, 2015). [Both states also highlighted the fact
that they could not control each individual in their country and
therefore could not be held responsible for individual
acts.]{.underline} Since then it seems that the number of attacks on
commercial targets has diminished (Timm, 2016). Former President Obama
suggested the creation of a position of cybersecurity ambassador to deal
with bilateral or multilateral treaties concerning cyber-norms (Lee,
2016). For this kind of de-escalation to take effect, the termination of
the conflict at hand must be the stated aim of both parties. A clear
common understanding of the terms of agreement is required and must be
based on trust-building efforts, as well as the assurance of mutual
adherence. The difficulty of tracking the implementation of such
agreements in cyberspace has been an obstacle preventing more states
consenting to such solutions (Lin, 2012, pp. 62--64). Nevertheless, **[a
[dialogue on cyberspace already exists]{.mark} between the USA and
Russia]{.underline}** since July 2013. This **[[cooperation
includes]{.underline}]{.mark}** Confidence Building Measures
(**[[CBM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [such as the creation of working groups
on the issue of ICT security, exchange of information between the two
national]{.underline} Computer Emergency Response Teams
([[CERT]{.underline}), **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the creation of
a [direct communication]{.mark} line [to]{.mark} directly
[manage]{.mark} ICT [incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Segal, 2016; The
White House, Office of the Press Secretary, 2013). In October 2016,
former President Obama used the latter to inform Russian President Putin
that the USA was accusing Russia of interference in the election process
(Ignatius, 2016). Furthermore, Russia and the USA take part in the UN
GGE supporting the future establishment of international norms on
actions in cyberspace. [They stated that international law can be
applied in cyberspace and therefore, the rules of proportionality and
limited collateral damage should also be respected in
cyberattacks]{.underline} (Ignatius, 2016; United Nations General
Assembly, 2015). These examples demonstrate that **[[even though]{.mark}
the two [states are involved]{.mark} in a ["tit-for-tat"]{.mark} logic
in their relations on a tactical level, [there was still]{.mark} a
[dialogue on the strategic level]{.mark}]{.underline}**, at least until
2015. The recent cyberattacks in USA and the election of Donald Trump as
US President, bring new uncertainties.

#### They have [zero interest]{.underline} in producing [widespread]{.underline} damage

Dr. James Andrew **Lewis 18**, Senior Vice President at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, Ph.D. from the University of
Chicago, January 2018, "Rethinking Cybersecurity: Strategy, Mass Effect,
and States," <https://tinyurl.com/y27xcqbb>, p. 7-11

Similarly, [the popular idea that opponents use cyber techniques to
inflict cumulative economic harm is not supported by evidence. Economic
warfare has always been part of conflict, but [there are no examples
of]{.mark} a country seeking to imperceptibly [harm]{.mark} the economy
of an opponent]{.underline}. The United States engaged in economic
warfare during the Cold War, and still uses sanctions as a tool of
foreign power, but few if any other nations do the same. The intent of
cyber espionage is to gain market or technological advantage. Coercive
actions against government agencies or companies are intended to
intimidate. **[Terrorists do not seek to inflict economic
damage]{.underline}**. [The difficulty of wreaking real harm on large,
interconnected economies is usually ignored]{.underline}.

[Economic warfare in cyberspace is ascribed to China, but]{.underline}
China\'s cyber doctrine has three elements: control of cyberspace to
preserve party rule and political stability, espionage (both commercial
and military), and preparation for disruptive acts to damage an
opponent\'s weapons, military information systems, and command and
control. [\"Strategic\" uses, such as striking civilian infrastructure
in the opponent\'s homeland, appear to be a lower priority and are an
adjunct to nuclear strikes as part of China\'s strategic
deterrence.]{.underline} [Chinese officials seem more concerned about
accelerating China\'s growth rather than some long-term effort to
undermine the American economy]{.underline}.6 The 2015 agreement with
the United States served Chinese interests by centralizing tasking
authority in Beijing and ending People\'s Liberation Army (PLA)
\"freelancing\" against commercial targets.

[The Russians specialize in coercion, financial crime, and creating
harmful cognitive effect]{.underline}---the ability to manipulate
emotions and decisionmaking. Under their 2010 military doctrine on
disruptive information operations (part of what they call \"New
Generation Warfare\"). [**[Russians want confusion, not]{.mark} physical
[damage]{.mark}**. Iran and **No**rth **Ko**rea use cyber actions
against American banks or entertainment companies like Sony or the Sands
Casino, but their goal is political coercion, not
destruction.]{.underline}

[None of these countries talk about death by 1000 cuts or attacking
critical infrastructure]{.underline} to produce a cyber Pearl Harbor or
any of the other scenarios that dominate the media. The few disruptive
attacks on critical infrastructure have focused almost exclusively on
the energy sector. [Major financial institutions face a high degree of
risk but in most cases, the attackers\' intent is to extract
money]{.underline}. [There have been cases of service disruption and
data erasure, but these have been **limited** in scope.
Denial-of-service attacks against banks impede services and may be
costly to the targeted bank, but **do not have a major effect on the
national economy**]{.underline}. In all of these actions, **[there is a
line that countries have been unwilling to cross.]{.underline}**

[When our [opponents]{.mark} decided to challenge American \"hegemony,\"
they developed [strategies]{.mark} to [circumvent]{.mark} the risks of
**[retal]{.mark}**iation or escalation [by ensuring]{.mark} that their
[actions stayed below]{.mark} the [use-of-force
threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}---an imprecise threshold, roughly defined
by international law, but usually considered to involve actions that
produce destruction or casualties. [**Almost [all cyber attacks fall
below this]{.mark} threshold, including, crime, espionage, and
politically coercive acts**. This explains why the decades-long quest to
rebuild Cold War deterrence in cyberspace has been
fruitless.]{.underline}

[It also explains why we have not seen the dreaded cyber Pearl Harbor or
other predicted catastrophes.]{.underline} [Opponents are keenly aware
that launching catastrophe brings with it immense risk of receiving
catastrophe in return]{.underline}. [States are the only actors who can
carry out catastrophic cyber attacks and they are **very unlikely** to
do so in a strategic environment that seeks to gain advantage without
engaging in armed conflict]{.underline}. Decisions on targets and attack
make sense only when embedded in their larger strategic calculations
regarding how best to fight with the United States.

[There have been thousands of incidents of cybercrime and cyber
espionage, but only a **handful** of true attacks, where the intent was
not to extract information or money, but to disrupt and, in a few cases,
destroy.]{.underline} From these incidents, we can extract a more
accurate picture of risk. The salient incidents are the cyber operations
against Iran\'s nuclear weapons facility (Stuxnet), Iran\'s actions
against Aramco and leading American banks, North Korean interference
with Sony and with South Korean banks and television stations, and
Russian actions against Estonia, Ukrainian power facilities, Canal 5
(television network in France), and the 2016 U S. presidential
elections. **[Cyber attacks are not random]{.underline}**. [All of these
incidents have been part of larger geopolitical conflicts]{.underline}
involving Iran, Korea, and the Ukraine, or Russia\'s contest with the
United States and NATO.

[There are commonalities in each attack. All were undertaken by state
actors or proxy forces to achieve the attacking state\'s policy
objectives]{.underline}. **[Only two caused tangible
damage]{.underline}**; the rest created coercive effect, intended to
create confusion and psychological pressure through fear, uncertainty,
and embarrassment. **[In no instance were there deaths or
casualties]{.underline}**. [**[In two decades of cyber attacks, there
has never been a]{.mark} single [casualty]{.mark}**. This alone should
give pause to the doomsayers]{.underline}. **[[Nor]{.mark} has there
been widespread [collateral damage]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### No Russian Cyber\-\--AT: Ukraine

#### They're not using cyberattacks in Ukraine

Jason **Blessing 22**, Ph.D., is a Jeane Kirkpatrick Visiting Research
Fellow with the foreign and defense policy department at the American
Enterprise Institute, "Where is Russia's cyber blitzkrieg?," The Hill,
3/9/22,
<https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/597272-where-is-russias-cyber-blitzkrieg/>

[Fighting in Ukraine continues **but the much-anticipated Russian cyber
blitzkrieg hasn't occurred**. Russian forces have]{.underline}
**[failed]{.underline}** [to deploy devastating cyber attacks in
the]{.underline} [**opening salvo**, despite]{.underline} **[ample
opportunity]{.underline}** [to cripple Ukrainian networks. Where is the
**dramatic, game-changing cyber war we were promised?** Pundits are
scrambling for explanations. Spoiler alert: Cyber isn't a magic wand to
wave and gain battlefield superiority. Cyber attacks are rarely decisive
on their own, and they don't exist in a vacuum. Strategic context is
critical]{.underline} for unpacking the use of cyber operations, and
[Russia's invasion strategy]{.underline} [undeniably]{.underline} has
shaped and **[restricted]{.underline}** [its menu of cyber
options]{.underline}.

First, [the Kremlin's goal of **regime change in Kyiv**]{.underline}
[means]{.underline} that Russian [cyber operations are **subject to the
"you break it, you buy it" rule**. If your plan is to install a
**puppet**]{.underline} government, [the]{.underline} **[last thing you
want]{.underline}** to do [is]{.underline} **[obliterate]{.underline}**
Ukraine's communications networks and other critical
[**infrastructure**. Life would]{.underline} [be]{.underline}
**[miserable]{.underline}** for any regime trying to manage a population
with no electricity or water. [Now add]{.underline} an extra layer of
**[Ukrainian outrage]{.underline}** against a Russian lackey whom they
likely would violently oppose. As a result, the Russians have launched
limited attacks to temporarily disrupt public services. This has
included website vandalism, overloading government servers with traffic,
and using malware to wipe data from banking networks.

[Putin's]{.underline} **[overconfidence]{.underline}** in a swift and
overwhelming victory [is another reason]{.underline} for the lack of
cyber-induced damage. In thinking that this would be a quick
smash-and-grab, the Kremlin de facto shelved what could have been its
most powerful cyber capabilities. High-impact cyber attacks require
immense resources, planning time, and operational control so that they
hit their mark and aren't discovered before pulling the trigger. Meeting
these conditions is extremely hard, and it's not worth the effort if you
expect a quick win. Disruption therefore takes a backseat to
intelligence collection. While tracking targets on Ukrainian networks is
valuable, taking them offline is counterproductive. Putin's months-long
military buildup gave time to plan for high-end cyber warfare. That we
haven't seen it is a testament to false assumptions of quick victory and
an underestimation of Ukrainian cyber defense.

[Finally]{.underline}, the Russian military's **[poor
planning]{.underline}** and execution [in]{.underline} the early stages
of **[invasion]{.underline}** [cast]{.underline} **[doubt]{.underline}**
[on]{.underline} its [ability]{.underline} [to]{.underline} truly
**[integrate]{.underline}** [cyber with conventional operations in
combat]{.underline}. As I've written, this is a challenge for many
militaries. It is particularly true for Russia, where the military and
intelligence cyber-ecosystem is crowded with units that constantly
compete and lack coordination. But incorporating cyber effects into
kinetic operations is even harder for a military whose soldiers don't
know where they are or why they're deployed. Their reliance on civilian
radios and mobile phones for communication doesn't inspire much
confidence either.

[The Russians clearly excel in cyber **espionage**]{.underline}: By
hacking one company (SolarWinds) and corrupting a single software
product, Russian cyber operators gained access to several Fortune 500
companies and U.S. government agencies. [However, given the]{.underline}
**[lack of impact]{.underline}** in the past and current logistical
struggles, [we should]{.underline} **[temper our expectations about
Russian cyber prowess in wartime]{.underline}**.

[The Kremlin]{.underline} [**hasn't gotten the military knockout blow it
wanted, and missed its window of opportunity**. Cyber operations
would]{.underline} **[not have been decisive]{.underline}**. But they
could have enabled a first-mover advantage by taking out Ukraine's
digital eyes and ears, including the ability to receive and integrate
intelligence shared by NATO. This is not to say that cyber has no role
to play moving forward; quite the opposite. The longer the war lasts,
the greater likelihood that Russian forces will test out new tools on
Ukrainian networks. Such activity can manifest as increased intelligence
collection or the use of cyber capabilities at the tactical level to
produce limited, localized effects. Both could contribute to the
lethality of Russia's conventional strikes. For example, tactical cyber
attacks could facilitate a ground unit's ability to secure or destroy a
target by briefly disrupting specific networks within the given area of
operation.

### No Russian Cyber\-\--Nuclear Deterrence\-\--1NC

#### 'Deterrence' is about NC3 hacking\-\--that's nonsense

Dr. Andrew **Futter 16**, Associate Professor of International Politics
and Director of Research for Politics and International Relations at the
University of Leicester, "War Games Redux? Cyberthreats, US--Russian
Strategic Stability, and New Challenges for Nuclear Security and Arms
Control", European Security, Volume 25, Issue 2, p. 171-172

[[It is]{.underline}]{.mark} of course [**[highly unlikely]{.mark}**
that [either]{.mark} the **[US]{.mark}**A [or Russia has plans --
or]{.mark} perhaps more importantly, the [desire --
to]{.mark}]{.underline} fully [[undermine]{.mark} the [other's]{.mark}
nuclear **[c]{.mark}**]{.underline}ommand [[and
**c**]{.underline}]{.mark}ontrol [systems]{.underline} as a precursor to
some type of disarming first strike, but the perception that nuclear
forces and associated systems could be vulnerable or compromised is
persuasive. Or as Hayes (2015) puts it, "The risks of cyber disablement
entering into our nuclear forces are real". While [the [growing
possibility]{.mark} of "[cyber]{.mark} disablement" [should **not** be
**overstated** (notions of a]{.mark} "cyber-**[Pearl
Harbor]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Panetta 2012) [or "cyber
9--11"]{.underline} (Charles 2013) [[have **done little** to help
understand]{.mark} the nature of the challenge]{.underline}),
cyberthreats are nevertheless an increasingly important component of the
contemporary US--Russia strategic context. This is particularly the case
when they are combined with other emerging military-technical
developments and programmes. The net result, especially given the
current downturn in US--Russian strategic relations, and the way cyber
is exacerbating the impact of other problematic strategic dynamics, is
that is seems highly unlikely that either the USA or Russia will make
the requisite moves to de-alert nuclear forces that the new cyber
challenges appear to necessitate, or for that matter to (re)embrace the
"deep nuclear cuts" agenda any time soon.

Assessing the options for arms control and enhancing mutual security

Given the new challenges presented by cyber to both US and Russian
nuclear forces and to US--Russia strategic stability, it is important to
consider what might be done to help mitigate and guard against these
threats, and thereby help minimise the risks of unintentional launches,
miscalculation, and accidents, and perhaps create the conditions for
greater stability, de-alerting, and further nuclear cuts. While there is
unlikely to be a panacea or "magic bullet" that will reduce the risk of
cyberattacks on US and Russian nuclear forces to zero -- be they
designed to launch nuclear weapons or compromise the systems that
support them -- there are a number of options that might be considered
and pursued in order to address these different types of threats and
vulnerabilities. None, of these however, will be easy.

The most obvious and immediate priority for both the USA and Russia is
working (potentially together) to harden and better protect nuclear
systems against possible cyberattack, intrusion, or cyber-induced
accidents. In fact, in October 2013 it was announced that Russian
nuclear command and control networks would be protected against cyber
incursion and attacks by "special units" of the Strategic Missile Forces
(Russia Today 2014). Other measures will include better network defences
and firewalls, more sophisticated cryptographic codes, upgraded and
better protected communications systems (including cables), extra
redundancy, and better training and screening for the practitioners that
operate these systems (see Ullman 2015). However, and while
comprehensive reviews are underway to assess the vulnerabilities of
current US and Russian nuclear systems to cyberattacks, it may well be
that US and Russian C2 infrastructure becomes more vulnerable to cyber
as it is modernised and old analogue systems are replaced with
increasingly hi-tech digital platforms. As a result, and while
[**[nuclear]{.mark}** weapons [and **c**]{.mark}ommand [and
**c**]{.mark}ontrol [infrastructure are]{.mark} likely to be [the **best
protected** of **all**]{.mark} computer systems, [and **"air
gapped"**]{.mark}]{.underline}14 [[from the]{.mark} wider
[Internet]{.mark}]{.underline} -- this does not mean they are
invulnerable or will continue to be secure in the future, particularly
as systems are modernised or become more complex (Fritz 2009). Or as
Peggy Morse, ICBM systems director at Boeing, put it, "while its old
it's very secure" (quoted in Reed 2012).

#### [Alt causes]{.underline}\-\--Klare says [China]{.underline}, [Iran]{.underline}, and [North Korea]{.underline} will do it AND target the [U.S.]{.underline}, not NATO

#### Deterrence is [strong]{.underline} and [resilient]{.underline}\-\--the [only]{.underline} threats are [alt causes]{.underline}

C. Todd **Lopez 20**, Reporter at DOD News, "U.S. Seeks to Maintain
Credible Nuclear Deterrent", DOD News, 3/3/2020,
https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2101067/us-seeks-to-maintain-credible-nuclear-deterrent/

[The **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[maintains a **robust**]{.mark} nuclear [arsenal]{.mark} that [consists
of **ground**]{.mark}-based, **[air]{.mark}**-launched [and
**sea**]{.mark}-launched weapons. Together, it\'s commonly called [the
**\"nuclear triad,\"**]{.mark} and it [**remains** the **centerpiece**
of the]{.mark} U.S. nuclear [deterrent]{.mark}]{.underline}. The triad
is fast approaching the end of its service life and must quickly be
replaced before it\'s lost.

Victorino G. Mercado, currently performing the duties of the assistant
secretary of defense for strategy, plans and capabilities testified
today before the House Armed Services Committee, subcommittee on
strategic forces. He told lawmakers that efforts to replace the triad
are not part of an arms race.

\"The U.S. seeks only what it needs to maintain a credible nuclear
deterrent,\" he said. \"In contrast to Russia, who maintains about 2,000
non-strategic nuclear weapons and are pursuing and fielding other novel
nuclear capabilities, we have no desire or intent to engage in an arms
race nor match weapon-for-weapon the capabilities being fielded by
Russia.\"

The DOD\'s fiscal year 2021 budget request for nuclear forces, Mercado
said, is \$28.9 billion, or 4.1% of the total DOD request. The funding
request to modernize the existing triad is about 1.7% of the budget
request, he added. \"The nation's nuclear modernization program is
affordable,\" he said.

Mercado said that [[after **decades** of **deferred**
recapitalization]{.underline}]{.mark} of the nuclear triad, [the [U.S.
must move ahead with]{.mark} [**modernizing** its]{.mark} nuclear
[forces]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, as defined in the Nuclear
Posture Review, the U.S. must also pursue additional flexibility with
systems like the sea-launched cruise missile, he said, \"to ensure that
there are no gains to be made through the use of any nuclear weapon,
strategic or otherwise.\"

### No Grid Impact\-\--1NC

#### Cyber attacks won't take down the grid

Victoria **Craig 16**, Analyst at Fox Business, Citing the Senior
Manager of Industrial Control Systems at Mandiant, "The U.S. Power Grid
is \'Vulnerable,\' But Don\'t Panic Just Yet",
http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/02/02/u-s-power-grid-is-vulnerable-but-dont-panic-just-yet.html

The idea of the nation\'s power grids becoming the next battleground for
cyber warriors could make hacking into consumers' credit card accounts
and personal information seem like child's play. [While U.S. power
companies are likely targeted by foreign governments]{.underline} and
others in increasingly sophisticated breaches, **[actually [shutting
off]{.mark} the lights]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline} **[causing
chaos]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[far more
[complicated]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[than many pundits make it
seem.]{.underline} Dan [Scali]{.underline}, [senior manager of
industrial control systems at Mandiant, a cybersecurity consulting arm
of FireEye
([FEYE](http://www.foxbusiness.com/quote.html?stockTicker=FEYE)),]{.underline}
[explained]{.underline} that [while cyber criminals]{.underline} [may
gain [access]{.mark} to power and utility data systems]{.underline},
[it]{.underline} **[[doesn't]{.underline}]{.mark}** necessarily
**[[mean]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the result will be [a]{.mark} **power
[outage]{.mark}** []{.mark}and a **total takedown** of power grid
control systems.]{.underline} In other words, [the power [grid
is]{.mark} controlled by **[more than just]{.mark} a panel** of digital
[buttons. ]{.mark}]{.underline}["[Losing]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[control]{.mark} system is bad]{.underline} from the perspective that it
takes you out of your normal mode of operations of being able to control
everything from one command center, [but]{.underline} [it [**doesn't**
mean]{.mark} you've lost control or all the **[lights go
out]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[in the city\]," Scali explained. While many
of the systems have been modernized to include digitized control panels,
[if a hacker were to infiltrate the system, [a utility worker could
still]{.mark} have the ability to]{.underline} **[[manually
control]{.mark} the [machines]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}[by]{.underline} **[flipping a switch]{.underline}**, pushing a
button, or tripping a breaker. As the world saw with the recent attack
in Ukraine, which caused a blackout for 80,000 customers of the nation's
western utility, the biggest problem may be ensuring the power grid's
control systems are not vulnerable to cyber break ins. The January
attack in Ukraine was likely caused by a corrupted Microsoft Word
attachment that allowed remote control over the computer, according to
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Scali said [[there was **no
ev**]{.mark}**idence** from the incident in Ukraine that the hacker's
[**malware**]{.mark} was able to **physically [shut down]{.mark}** the
[power]{.mark}.]{.underline} "It wiped out machines, deleted all the
files. Kill disk malware made it impossible to remotely control things.
It caused chaos on the business network, and the area where control
system operations sat. But the attacker, we believe, would have had to
actually used the control system to cause load shedding, which caused
the power to go out, or trip breakers to cause the actual problem.
Malware itself didn't turn the power out," Scali said. He said what most
likely happened in that incident was the hacker stole user credentials
and logged into the system remotely. The bottom line: Yes, a similar
event could happen in the U.S. And corporate America is concerned. A
recent survey released in January on the state of information security,
conducted by consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers, showed
cybersecurity as one of the biggest concerns among the top brass at U.S.
power and utilities firms. Part of the problem, Brad Bauch, security and
cyber sector leader at PwC said, is the interconnectedness of the
industry's tools. "Utilities want to be able to get information out of
\[their\] systems to more efficiently operate them, and also share that
information with customers so they have more real-time information into
their usage," he explained. While allowing access to their own
consumption data allows the companies to give their customers more of
what they want, it also opens up a host of access points for hackers,
making the systems more vulnerable than they otherwise would be. But
[[to say]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} power [grid is susceptible to
cyber]{.mark} hackers [is]{.mark} a bit of an
**[oversimplification]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### No Grid Impact\-\--No Cyber Threat\-\--2NC

#### Russia [won't target]{.underline} the grid AND attacks would [fail]{.underline}

Paul **Wagenseil 19**, Senior Editor of Security and Privacy at Tom's
Guide, Citing Selena Larson, Intelligence Analyst at Dragos
Cybersecurity Firm, "Hackers Can\'t Cause Crippling Blackouts, Expert
Says", Tom's Guide, 3/11/2019,
https://www.tomsguide.com/us/blackout-hack-threat-rsa2019,news-29594.html

[Don\'t believe the hype. [Hackers cannot]{.mark} easily [take down
the]{.mark} North American electrical [grid]{.mark} to cause massive
blackouts, despite numerous news stories, magazine articles and books
claiming that they can, a cybersecurity expert told the last week\'s RSA
Conference.]{.underline}

\"[There are lots of misunderstandings about threats to the electric
grid,\" said Selena Larson, an **intelligence analyst at** Maryland
**cybersecurity firm** Dragos and a former CNN reporter.]{.underline}
\"[The reality is that [a]{.mark} destructive [incident at one site
would]{.mark} require highly tailored \[malware\] tools and operations,
and would **[not]{.mark} effectively [scale]{.mark}.\"**]{.underline}

[That\'s [because]{.mark} U.S. power [plants use different]{.mark} makes
and [models]{.mark} of hardware and software, are often at least partly
[**isolated from the** internet and]{.mark} from [**each other**, and
have]{.mark} already undergone a **fair degree of [hardening]{.mark}**
against cyberattacks. There\'s **very little chance** that a single
hacker or group of hackers could knock out the power across a large
swath of North America at once.]{.underline}

[Scary headlines]{.underline}

[Those inconvenient facts haven\'t prevented journalists and writers
from penning what Larson deemed needlessly alarming stories. One July
2018 opinion piece in The New York Times]{.underline} entitled \"To
Hackers, We\'re Bambi in the Woods\" [began with a nightmare scenario
of]{.underline} an America thrown back to the [Stone Age by a
cyberattack that kills the power, stops the trains, empties bank
accounts and opens literal floodgates.]{.underline}

[Later that same month, The **[W]{.mark}**all **[S]{.mark}**treet
**[J]{.mark}**ournal [ran a story called \"Russian Hackers Reach]{.mark}
U.S. [Utility Control Rooms,]{.mark} Homeland Security Officials Say,\"
lending credence to the nightmare scenario. But it was
**[incorrect]{.mark}**ly reported --- it was **[based on old
info]{.mark}**rmation that had been **revisited in a DHS
presentation.**]{.underline}

Larson didn\'t mention \"[Lights Out]{.underline}: A Cyberattack, A
Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath,\" [a best-selling 2015
book]{.underline} by former ABC News anchor Ted Koppel.

\"A well-designed attack on just one of the nation\'s three electric
power grids could cripple much of our infrastructure --- and in the age
of cyberwarfare, a laptop has become the only necessary weapon,\" reads
the jacket blurb following [another apocalyptic scenario of a
months-long blackout leading to societal collapse.]{.underline}

State-sponsored attacks

[The truth is that **[Russia]{.mark}**n hackers do try to get into
American power plants, but so far they\'ve [only]{.mark} seemed to be
**[perform]{.mark}**ing **[recon]{.mark}**naissance]{.underline}, Larson
said. [Destructive malware has infected the office networks of some
power companies, but the **[companies weren\'t specifically
targeted]{.mark}**, and the [malware **didn\'t cross over** into]{.mark}
plant **[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

\"A [**[ransomware]{.mark}** infection at the financial-services
division of an electric utility [doesn\'t]{.mark} automatically
[translate to a **blackout**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Larson said.

While most state-sponsored hacker groups targeting power plants and
other industrial-control systems only gather information, two other have
gone further, Larson said. Those were the Electrum group, which used
malware dubbed CrashOverride to take down a Ukrainian power plant in
2016, and the Trisis group, which infected the safety systems at a Saudi
petrochemical plant in 2017.

Both attacks have been attributed to Russian state-sponsored hackers,
and the Saudi-plant attack led another presenter at RSA 2019 to conclude
that cyberattacks would soon kill people, either deliberately or
accidentally.

But [as Dragos founder and CEO Robert M. Lee stated]{.underline} in a
2017 blog posting describing the CrashOverride malware[, \"the public
must understand that the outages could be in hours or days, **not weeks
or months**.\"]{.underline}

Lee said that [Dragos had \"high confidence\" that the CrashOverride
hackers were the same who had in fact targeted U.S. and European
infrastructure companies in 2014]{.underline}. And CrashOverride
contained modules to \"delete files and processes off of the running
systems\" to sabotage computer systems.

Larson said, however, that [the CrashOverride creators had spent months
or years planning the attack, and that the malware was specifically
designed for that power plant. The attacks couldn\'t easily scale across
the world, or even across Ukraine.]{.underline}

Outlook

There are true cyberattack threats out there, Larson added. For example,
the Russian NotPetya ransomware worm in June 2017 cost the Maersk
shipping line an estimated \$200 million, and FedEx an estimated \$300
million. The North Korean WannaCry attack the previous month crippled
hospital computer systems in Europe and North America.

But [in terms of the North American power grid, small animals such as
**squirrels, cats and raccoons are a much larger threat than hackers**,
and have caused hundreds of localized blackouts, Larson said. That
mundane detail doesn\'t sell books.]{.underline}

The [public should be reassured, she added, that the North American
power grid (there are in fact three grids) has always been engineered to
limit both the duration and the geographic reach of blackouts, and that
there\'s no single power switch that can turn it all off.]{.underline}

\"[The truth is that [the]{.mark} North American electric [grid is
**resilient** and **segmented**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Larson said.

#### No blackouts

Selena **Larson 18**, Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst at Dragos, Inc.,
"Threats to Electric Grid are Real; Widespread Blackouts are Not",
8/6/2018,
https://dragos.com/blog/industry-news/threats-to-electric-grid-are-real-widespread-blackouts-are-not/

[**The US electric [grid]{.mark}** [is not about to go
down]{.mark}]{.underline}. Though it's understandable if someone
believed that. Over the last few weeks, numerous media reports suggest
state-backed hackers have infiltrated the US electric grid and are
capable of manipulating the flow of electricity on a grand scale and
cause chaos. [Threats]{.underline} against industrial sectors including
electric utilities, oil and gas, and manufacturing [are
growing,]{.underline} and it's reasonable for people to be concerned.
[But to say hackers]{.underline} have [invaded the US electric grid and
are prepared to cause blackouts is false]{.underline}. The initial
reporting stemmed from a public Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
presentation in July on Russian hacking activity targeting US electric
utilities. This presentation contained previously-reported information
on a group known as Dragonfly by Symantec and which Dragos associates to
activity labeled DYMALLOY and ALLANITE. These
[[groups]{.underline}]{.mark} focus on information gathering from
industrial control system (ICS) networks and [[have not
demonstrated]{.mark} **disruptive or damaging
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While some news reports cite 2015
and 2016 blackouts in Ukraine as evidence of hackers' disruptive
capabilities, DYMALLOY nor ALLANITE were involved in those incidents and
it is inaccurate to suggest the DHS's public presentation and those
destructive behaviors are linked. [Adversaries]{.underline} have not
placed "cyber implants" into the electric grid to cause blackouts; but
they are [infiltrating business networks]{.underline} -- and in some
cases, ICS networks -- in an effort to steal information and
intelligence to potentially gain access to operational systems. Overall,
the activity is concerning and represents the prerequisites towards a
potential future disruptive event -- [but evidence]{.underline} to date
[does not support the claim that such an attack is imminent.
**[The]{.mark} US electric [grid]{.mark}** [is **resilient** and
**segmented**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [although it makes an
interesting plot to an action movie]{.underline}, one or two strains of
malware [**[targeting]{.mark} operational [networks]{.mark}** [would not
cause]{.mark} **widespread [blackouts]{.mark}**. A destructive [incident
at one site would require]{.mark} **highly-[tailored
tools]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and **operations** and would not]{.mark}
**effectively [scale]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Essentially,
[**[localized]{.mark} impacts** [are possible]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
asset owners and operators should work to defend their networks from
intrusions such as those described by DHS. [[But scaling
up]{.underline}]{.mark} from isolated events to widespread impacts
[[is]{.mark} **highly [unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### All the important stuff is [offline]{.underline}

Lila **Kee 16**, General Manager for GlobalSign\'s North and South
American Operations, "Why Haven\'t We Seen a Disastrous Electric Power
Grid Attack Yet?",
https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/large-scale-electric-power-grid-attack/

[If you based **everything** off what major news outlets are
saying]{.underline}, [[you'd think]{.mark} our **[C]{.mark}ritical
[N]{.mark}ational [I]{.mark}nfrastructure**]{.underline},
[particularly]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[energy

**weaknesses**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
[**[ripe]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [a **catastrophic**
[cyber]{.mark}-attack]{.underline}. But [the reality is]{.underline},
[we haven't experienced one yet]{.underline} (thankfully). [[Putting
aside]{.mark} larger [political reasons]{.mark}]{.underline} [(**[fear
of retal]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[iation]{.underline}**, **[widespread
[economic effects]{.mark}]{.underline}**, etc.), [is it possible that we
haven't seen one because these [vulnerabilities have been
**overstated**]{.mark} or the [likelihood has been
**exaggerated**]{.mark}? Below are some of my personal thoughts on the
matter.]{.underline} Note: To be clear, I do not mean to imply we are
"in the clear" and don't need to worry about cybersecurity for the
energy grid. On the contrary, continual efforts on best practices
development, standards creation, regulation and vertical-specific
technologies is of the utmost importance, especially as energy systems
are brought online. I'm merely trying to see through the FUD and
showcase the efforts that have helped keep the grid safe so far. [[Major
Systems Have Been]{.underline} **[Offline]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and
New [Smart Systems Will Be **Secured from the
Start**]{.mark}]{.underline} [Grid [providers are]{.mark} being [hacked
**every day**]{.mark}]{.underline} (303 incidents were reported to the
Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \[ICS-CERT\] in
2015), [[but most]{.mark} of those hacks [were
**unsuccessful**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[due to]{.mark} major
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline} that could cause devastation
[[being]{.underline}]{.mark} either [**[off-line]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline}]{.mark} [accessible [only]{.mark} by **[private
networks]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e. not run over the internet).
[[Vulnerabilities]{.mark} to older systems [are]{.mark} being
[**addressed** through **retrofits**]{.mark}, but again most of these
systems are offline.]{.underline} The good news is [the next generation
of smart grid systems are being designed with security in mind **from
day one.**]{.underline} One good example is the Open Field Message Bus
(OpenFMB) framework that provides a specification for intelligent power
systems field devices to leverage a nonproprietary and standards-based
reference architecture, which consists of internet protocol (IP)
networking and Internet of Things (IoT) messaging. OpenFMB is one of
Smart Grid Interoperability Panel's (SGIP) Energy IoT initiative
projects, developed to accelerate IoT innovation within the energy
industry. As seen in other industries such as automotive, manufacturing
and smart cities, the value added services around energy grid IoT
innovation are virtually limitless. However, just like other industries,
security concerns are top of mind. That's where the North American
Energy Standards Board's (NAESB) role really proves vital. OpenFMB has
smartly teamed with NAESB to develop a complementary set of standards
for utility providers to follow. Given NAESB's track record of standards
development and tight relationship with NERC and FERC, a set of
standards to accompany OpenFMB's specification is more likely to gather
industry participation and accelerate adoption.

by The Hill. In the event of a cyberattack that disabled large areas of
the power grid, the person from NERC would be the liaison between the
Department of Homeland Security and the electric industry. Working
together will be key, according to Cauley. "This is not anyone's problem

### No Grid Impact\-\--Resiliency\-\--2NC

[[We've]{.mark} all [seen]{.mark} the [news reports on]{.mark} **power
[grid vulnerabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and the possibility of an
**impending terror attack**]{.underline}. Recently, Ted Koppel's book,
"[Lights
Out](http://www.amazon.com/Lights-Out-Cyberattack-Unprepared-Surviving/dp/055341996X),"
caused a wave of press around the issue. Similar spikes in press
occurred in the year after the PG&E [Metcalf substation
sabotage](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/PGE-Makes-Security-Upgrades-at-Metcalf-Substation-297045201.html)
and around the National Geographic special in October 2013, "[American
Blackout.](http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/american-blackout/)"
There are both good points and some amount of exaggeration in the
reporting on grid vulnerabilities, so I'll be debunking a couple of
[power grid
security](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/industries/energy/external-utilities-smart-grid/security.html)
myths. The [Associated
Press](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c8d531ec05e0403a90e9d3ec0b8f83c2/ap-investigation-us-power-grid-vulnerable-foreign-hacks)
credits anonymous top experts for revealing about a dozen times in the
last decade, "...sophisticated foreign hackers have gained enough remote
access to control the operations networks that keep the lights on..."
Rather than anonymous "top experts" you can find the results of an
authoritative investigation, with attribution, in the 2007 report, "[Top
10 vulnerabilities of control systems and their associated
mitigations](http://www.nerc.com/comm/CIPC/Related%20Files%20DL/2007_Top_10_Final_Approved_by_CIPC.pdf),"
from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Control
Systems Security Working Group. Headlines about the cyberattack on the
Ukraine power grid greeted us at the start of 2016. [Ars
Technica](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/01/first-known-hacker-caused-power-outage-signals-troubling-escalation/)
reported, "Highly destructive malware creates 'destructive events' at 3
Ukrainian substations." Utilities Telecom Council Security offered a
slightly different perspective in the Risk and Compliance Digest from
January 6, 2016: "Some news media have speculated that the attacks were
launched by or for Russia, in retaliation for Ukrainian activists'
attacks on the power supply to Crimea. That linkage will likely be
impossible to prove or disprove. At present there is not enough evidence
to positively conclude that this was a cyberattack or who is
responsible. Regardless, the outage is fact. The discovered malware
includes updated versions of known tools such as KillDisk, which is not
in itself malware, and BlackEnergy. However there is no smoking gun --
no piece of malicious code that definitively caused the outage.
Researchers have yet to rule out the possibility of insider
collaboration in the attack, possibly working in tandem with the
malware." [**Instead of panicking, [let's fact check]{.mark} some
claims. [Myth #1]{.mark}**[: Our]{.mark} power [system is aging and
outdated]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [Associated
Press](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c8d531ec05e0403a90e9d3ec0b8f83c2/ap-investigation-us-power-grid-vulnerable-foreign-hacks)
warns that "Many of the substations and equipment that move power across
the U.S. are decrepit and were never built with network security in
mind..." [It certainly is the case that many of the capital assets that
comprise the United States grid infrastructure are used beyond their
intended useful life of 25 years or longer.]{.underline} The initial
operations certificates for nuclear power plants were 40 years. Of
course they were never built with network security in mind because 40
years ago networks, if they existed at all, were local and limited
(DECNet, Token Ring, etc.) For reference: [The Hoover Dam was
constructed in 1935. The San Onofre Nuclear Generating
Station]{.underline} (SONGS) Unit 1 [started operation in
1968.]{.underline} Cisco was founded in December of 1984.
[**[Despite]{.mark} their [age]{.mark}**[, utilities every year spend

maintenance on an energized 765K Volt Line. [[**Myth #2:** We are
unprepared]{.mark} if the grid goes down.]{.underline} Ted [Koppel's
book primarily focuses on the potential **consequences** of an
**extended power outage**]{.underline}, echoing the National Geographic
special from 2 years earlier. [Ted states that, "The Department of
Homeland Security has no plans beyond those designed to deal with the
aftermath of natural disasters]{.underline}." And that "We are
unprepared..." Both Ted Koppel and National Geographic start with the
assumption that the grid has been disabled for months to establish the
assumed starting conditions against which the story of preparedness for
months of no power is told. [The North American utility
[industry]{.mark} would]{.underline} **[[disagree]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[with the impression created by these writings that nothing has been
done]{.underline}. **[[They]{.mark} have [spent
billions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[implementing]{.underline}]{.mark} ever
[more stringent versions of NERC-CIP and other **grid [reliability

Critical Infrastructure Security provisions in the 2016 budget bill just

famous quote goes, "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty" and in
this case, Eternal Vigilance is the price of security of our critical
infrastructure. Despite what has been done to secure the grid, the
industry remains too smug about the disconnected nature of many critical
systems. In doing so, they overlook the fact that some of the most
successful and devastating cyberattacks have been carried out against
systems that were not connected to the internet, the most prominent
example being Stuxnet and the damage to the Iranian centrifuge
capability. [[Despite having **rifle bullets** shot into]{.mark} the

### No Grid Impact\-\--No Extinction\-\--2NC

#### Their evidence cites the EMP commission. They're professional crackpots!

Patrick **Disney 11**, Graduate Student Focusing on Iran and Nuclear
Nonproliferation at Yale University, Former Assistant Policy Director
for the National Iranian American Council, "The Campaign to Terrify You
About EMP", The Atlantic, 7/15/2011,
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/07/the-campaign-to-terrify-you-about-emp/241971/

As with many things in Washington, [[a **cottage industry** of
lobbyists]{.mark}, specialists, and ex-government officials [has come
together]{.mark} to attest to the danger of an EMP attack]{.underline}.
Ballistic missile defense seems to be the panacea for this group\'s
concern, though a generous dose of preemption and war on terror are
often prescribed as well. [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[created
a]{.mark} special **[EMP commission]{.mark}** in 2001 to study the
issue]{.underline} and make recommendations to government and industry.
It seems **[[the only ones who]{.underline}]{.mark}** take the time to
talk about EMP publicly, however, are those who **[[believe it]{.mark}
to be the [paramount]{.mark} threat]{.underline}** facing America.
According to their warnings over the last decade, our vulnerability
worsens every day, and that vulnerability invites an attack.

For example, **[EMPact America]{.underline}**, the group that hosted the
conference at Niagara Falls, [has been [on a **lobbying
blitz**]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent weeks to pass the SHIELD Act. The
bill, which is [[backed by the]{.mark} Congressional [**\"EMP Caucus\"**
(yes, such a thing exists)]{.mark}]{.underline} is intended to protect
the electrical grid of the continental United States from the effects of
an EMP attack. [EMPact America even produces a weekly, hour-long radio
show devoted entirely to the issue]{.underline}, with recent guests
including former CIA Director James Woolsey and Congressman Trent
Franks. What sort of response have these warnings gotten so far? [[In
Washington\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [arms control
[circles]{.mark}]{.underline}, where I\'ve spent the past few months
working as part of my research on the Iranian nuclear program,
**[[they\'re not]{.mark} really [taken seriously]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

But how can one side of a debate claim something threatens the very
fiber of U.S. civilization, without getting so much as a nod in return?
Serious public figures have taken up the cause: Congressmen, generals,
scientists and strategists, all without much policy movement to show for
their efforts.

It may be that a terrorist, after going through the trouble of acquiring
a nuclear warhead and a missile capable of delivering it to America\'s
shores, would be a fool to employ the ultimate weapon in such a
cockamamie fashion. The effects of an EMP are far from universal;
according to one commissioned study, a best-case scenario would impact
70 percent of electronics, while a worst-case estimate could be as low
as 5 percent. Far better from the terrorist\'s perspective to deliver
the bomb as it was intended, rather than hang his hopes on a series of
unpredictable events and second- or third-order consequences. After all,
a nuclear bomb need not be made any more devastating to serve a
terrorist\'s purposes.

A slightly more plausible scenario could involve a state actor who,
facing a vastly superior U.S. military massed on its border, might
consider launching an EMP attack against U.S. troops as a way of evening
the playing field. Because the U.S. military is much more highly
dependent on technology than others, a rogue state facing the threat of
invasion could conceivably attempt such a tactic against invading forces
in the hopes that it could damage their capabilities without incurring
the totally devastating retaliation that a \"regular\" nuclear strike
would surely provoke. Of course, a wide-ranging EMP would knock out his
own electronics as much as it would anyone else\'s, so even this
scenario is a bit far-fetched.

But not as far-fetched as it may seem. One country\'s military has
already come close to employing this tactic on the battlefield: our own.
In 1991, Newsweek reported that General Norman Schwarzkopf sought
authorization to use a nuclear EMP to cripple Saddam Hussein\'s forces
at the start of the Gulf War. President George H.W. Bush nixed the plan,
probably because the U.S. isn\'t in the habit of launching nuclear
strikes of even the non-lethal kind, but the idea was tempting enough
that this warfighter took it to his bosses for approval.

[The bulk of the]{.underline} political [[debate]{.underline}]{.mark}
today over EMP [[focuses on how **disastrous** it would be if the
entire]{.mark} country\'s [power went off]{.mark} all at once,
[which]{.mark}]{.underline} arms control experts argue [[is, **to put it
mildly, unlikely**]{.mark}. Even \"ideas man\" Gingrich boils things
down to a biblical catastrophe waiting to happen, but the **[reality is
much more complicated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nuclear weapons, after
all, are more than enough of a threat in their own right. Putting too
much emphasis on something as unlikely as an EMP attack against the
American heartland risks distracting much-needed attention and resources
away from threats that are simply more plausible.

As the Republican presidential primary heats up, Gingrich or another
conservative voice may try to use the EMP \"threat\" as a campaign
issue. So far, it has not been much of a political winner. Of course,
when it comes to the politics of national security, it\'s often the
loudest voice, not the most informed, that prevails.

### No Grid Impact\-\--No Extinction\-\--AT: Meltdowns

#### Blackouts don't cause meltdowns [and]{.underline} no extinction

Nick **Stockton 16**, Science Reporter for WIRED magazine, \"Nuclear
Power Is Too Safe to Save the World From Climate Change,\" WIRED,
4/3/2016,
https://www.wired.com/2016/04/nuclear-power-safe-save-world-climate-change/

That's a good deal, but still. [Show a crowd a pair of cooling towers,
and at least some of them will see an atomic apocalypse featuring
three-eyed fish]{.underline}, leafless forests, and hospital-gowned
Soviet defectors with skin like glistening mayonnaise. Nuclear power may
be clean, but people still question whether it is, or ever will be, safe
enough.

Those fears may be moot. Safety concerns didn't delay construction on
Watts Bar Unit 2 for so many years. Economics did. For all that fear,
nuclear power still has the safest track record of any power source.

The Danger

Nuclear energy sources are dangerous because they emit
radiation---particles and energy shed from unstable molecules trying to
calm down. "Those radioactive missiles can hit the human body and damage
cells or DNA," says David Lochbaum, director of the Union of Concerned
Scientist's nuclear safety project. Enough radiation will give you
cancer, or possibly even pass genetic mutations on to your kids. Too
much can kill you outright.

But plants like Watts Bar don't release much radiation into the
environment. Inside, radioactive material heats water, which turns into
steam, which spins the enormous turbines that generate electricity.
Plants regularly release some of that water and steam at rates
prescribed by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and if you live
downriver or downwind of one, the radiation within will raise your
chances of developing a tumor by just one tenth of one percent. You're
far more likely to grow a tumor because you sneak a cigarette now and
again.

But you aren't afraid of routine releases. [You're terrified of another
Three Mile Island, Fukushima, or Chernobyl]{.underline}.

[These disasters were the result of a meltdown, which occurs when
something impedes a reactor's ability to cool the fuel]{.underline}. The
US, where nearly 20 percent of electricity comes from 99 nuclear plants,
uses uranium. Older reactors---which is every reactor in the US,
including Watts Bar Unit 2---use electric pumps to move water through
the system. The [[Fukushima]{.underline}]{.mark} disaster [[showed what
happens if you have]{.mark} pumps but [no power]{.mark} to use
them]{.underline}. [**[New]{.mark}**er **[gen]{.mark}**eration[**s**
rely on **gravity** instead]{.mark}]{.underline}, draining cooling water
from elevated storage tanks to send it through the reactor core.

[Those [**updates** mean]{.mark} serious nuclear [accidents are]{.mark}
becoming **[ever more rare]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Since Three Mile
Island in 1979, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that the rate of
shut-down-the-reactor-level problems has dropped from 2.5 per plant per
year to around 0.1]{.underline} (One such happened on March 29 in
Washington). [[Even Three Mile Island wasn't]{.mark} the
[disaster]{.mark} it could have been, [because of]{.mark} that plant's
layers of **[redundant protection]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[In terms of full blown nuclear disaster, there is really only one data
point: [Chernobyl]{.mark}. Which [was horrifying. But]{.mark} in terms
of [real risk]{.mark}? The **W**orld **H**ealth **O**rganization
estimates the disaster will claim **[4,000 lives]{.mark}**]{.underline},
a figure that includes everything from direct victims to people born
with genetic mutations well after the meltdown in 1986. By comparison,
[particulate matter from coal power plants kills about 7,500 people in
the US **every year**]{.underline}. [[Radiation is the **shark attack**
of]{.mark} environmental [danger]{.mark}: An awful way to go, but [far
less likely than]{.mark}, say, [a **car wreck**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Emergency systems Nuclear plants obviously require electricity to
operate their cooling pumps, not to mention their control systems. That
power is normally tapped off of the electricity that the reactor
generates. [[If]{.mark} the plant is [offline]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
[[power is provided by]{.underline}]{.mark} the electrical
[[grid]{.underline}]{.mark}. But what happens when the grid itself goes
down? The short answer is that large **[[on-site diesel
generators]{.underline}]{.mark}** automatically activate to provide
electricity. And if those should fail, **[[portable]{.mark} diesel
[generators]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which are also on-site, can be
connected. Recent [[standardization]{.mark} has also [ensured]{.mark}
that [generators can be swapped between plants]{.mark}]{.underline}
without the need to retrofit connectors. [There are also a couple of
[additional emergency systems]{.mark} that [can]{.mark} be used
specifically to [cool]{.mark} the reactor]{.underline}. These include
the [[turbine-driven-auxiliary-feedwater pump]{.underline}]{.mark},
which uses steam generated by the reactor to power a cooling turbine.
The pump requires an operator, but **[it [runs completely without
electricity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This system, however, is meant only
for emergency cooling of the reactor during those critical first few
days when the fuel rod assemblies are being brought down in temperature,
not for long-term cooling. And finally, in the [[worst
case]{.underline}]{.mark}, most [[plants]{.mark} have]{.underline} a
[method of [bringing in]{.mark} river]{.underline} or ocean [[water to
flood the reactor]{.underline}]{.mark}. This typically damages the
cooling system, but again, [it helps to cool and cover the reactor core
should all else fail]{.underline}. Unlike in other countries, permission
from the federal government is not required to flood the reactor.
Worst-case power-loss scenario With backup systems to the backup
systems, it would seem that there's nothing to worry about, right? Under
all but the direst of circumstances, I think that assessment is correct.
However, one could imagine a scenario in which the grid was lost and the
diesel generators ran out of fuel. Speaking of fuel, how much is
actually stored onsite? It depends on the plant, but at the Watts Bar
Nuclear Plant, for example, there is enough fuel to run the emergency
diesel generators for at least 42 days. I say at least because it would
depend on exactly what was being powered. Once the reactor was cooled
down, a much smaller system, known as the Residual Heat Removal System,
would be all that was required to keep the fuel assemblies cool, both in
the reactor and the spent fuel rods pool. The generators and onsite fuel
supply could power that smaller cooling system for significantly longer
than if they were powering the larger reactor cooling system. Even if we
assumed a worst case of 42 days, it's hard to imagine a scenario in
which that would not be enough time to bring in additional fuel either
by land, water, or air. Nonetheless, let's push the question a little
further. What would happen in the unlikely event that the diesel fuel
was exhausted? Even with the reactor having been successfully cooled,
the biggest risk would continue to be overheating of the fuel rod
assemblies, both in the reactor and the spent fuel rods pool. Without
circulation, the heat from the fuel rod assemblies could boil the
surrounding water, resulting in steam. In turn, the water levels would
drop, ultimately exposing the fuel rods to air. Once exposed to air,
their temperatures would rise but not to the levels that would melt the
zirconium cladding. Thankfully, that means that **[[meltdown would not
occur]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The steam might well carry radioactive
contaminants into the air, but [[there would be no]{.mark} release of
hydrogen and, thus, no subsequent [explosions]{.mark}. The situation
would certainly be dangerous to surrounding communities, but [it
wouldn't be]{.mark} the nuclear [Armageddon]{.mark} that many people
worry about.]{.underline}

#### No meltdowns impact, and evacuation solves

Tiffany **Kaiser 11**, writer for Daily Tech, citing Nuclear Regulatory
Commission Report, 8/2/2011, DailyTech, \"NRC: Far Fewer People Would
Die in a U.S. Nuclear Meltdown Than Previously Thought,\"
https://tinyurl.com/y4aujwkz

The [nuclear crisis at Fukushima]{.underline} Daiichi in Japan has
[caused a nuclear frenzy where leaders around the world are questioning
the safety of their plants.]{.underline} For instance, French President
Nicolas Sarkozy called for global nuclear review after visiting Japan,
and U.S. senators demanded that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
repeat an expensive inspection of the country\'s nuclear power.

But now, [the [NRC]{.mark} is close to completing **a [large nuclear
study]{.mark} that may ease a few worried minds**]{.underline}.

The NRC has been [[working with Sandia]{.underline}]{.mark} National
[[Lab]{.underline}]{.mark}oratories (a Department of Energy lab) [on a
study that **[revises]{.mark}**]{.underline} previous [[**projections**
of how quickly]{.mark} and how much [cesium]{.mark} 137,]{.underline}
which is a radioactive material made when uranium is split, [[could
release from]{.mark} a plant after [a]{.mark} nuclear core
[meltdown]{.mark}]{.underline}. The NRC has been working on the study
for six years, and it will not be completely finished until next spring.
But the nuclear watchdog group, Union of Concerned Scientists, has
obtained an early copy of the report through a Freedom of Information
Act request.

The new study is based on how much and how quickly cesium 137 could
escape an American nuclear plant **[[if a total blackout were to
occur]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A total blackout means complete loss of
power from the grid, and backup diesel generators and batteries have
failed as well. This leads to a nuclear meltdown. NRC scientists said
that a total blackout would be rare at an American plant, but it is
better to be safe than sorry. In addition, the NRC wanted to update
previous projections related to cesium 137.

The NRC focused on two different types of reactors in the U.S.: the
Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, which has
boiling-water reactors like Fukushima Daiichi, and the Surry Power
Station in Virginia, which has pressurized-water reactors. **[[Over
100]{.underline}]{.mark}** different [[plants were studied]{.underline}.
[Through **computer models** and engineering
analyses]{.underline}]{.mark}[, the [NRC]{.mark} has [concluded]{.mark}
that the [meltdown]{.mark}]{.underline} of a typical American reactor
**[[would lead to \"far fewer deaths\"]{.mark} than previously
thought.]{.underline}**

According to the new study, **[[only 1 to 2 percent]{.mark} of a reactor
core\'s cesium 137 [could escape]{.mark}]{.underline}** during a total
blackout. Previous NRC estimates concluded that 60 percent of the cesium
inventory could escape.

In addition, the new study found that **[[one person in every 4,348
within a 10-mile radius]{.underline}]{.mark}** of a nuclear meltdown
[[would develop]{.mark} a \"latent [cancer]{.mark}\"]{.underline} from
radiation exposure. In previous estimates, it was one person in every
167.

The NRC said that [large releases of radioactive material would not be
\"immediate,\" meaning]{.underline} that [[people]{.underline}]{.mark}
within a 10-mile radius **[would [have plenty of time to
evacuate]{.mark}]{.underline}** the premises. It concluded that the
chance of death from acute radiation exposure within a 10-mile radius
would be near zero, but some would be exposed to high enough doses to
experience fatal cancers decades later.

\"[[Accidents progress]{.mark} more [slowly]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
some cases much more slowly, [than previously assumed,\"]{.underline}
said Charles G. Tinkler, a senior adviser for research on severe
accidents and an author of the study. \"[Releases are
smaller]{.underline}, and in some cases much smaller, of certain key
radioactive materials.\"

[Today it [serves to **legitimize**]{.mark} and **legalize** the turn to
**["endless war"]{.mark}** that has characterized American foreign

With self-defense now anchored on national security interests, it has
released its former connections to time and to armed attack. From this
new foundation, it became useful to ambitious governments who are eager
to attack their enemies abroad. [[In
**self-defense**]{.underline}]{.mark} [defined as national

[The history of self-defense helps to show the gap between the

Conclusion

Amid deep conflict over basic norms, Egypt and the GCC states have
maneuvered between two poles while enjoying the tacit, if not explicit,
support of both sides. This has three key implications. First, global
cyber norms are much more complex --- and much more entangled with
traditional governance practices, diplomatic relationships, and
strategic concerns --- than Western officials may like to admit. However
uncomfortable it may be, [international policymaking on cyber norms must
take into account]{.underline} not only the "likemindedness" of some
states, but also [the fact of]{.underline} their [strategic
interests]{.underline} and relationships [with]{.underline} other
[[states]{.mark} that [are]{.mark}]{.underline} less or [**[not]{.mark}
at all [likeminded]{.mark}**. Without this recognition, [**any attempt**
to create]{.mark} global [cyber norms is **hampered**]{.mark} **from the
start**]{.underline}. More broadly, [to understand the **complexity** of
cyber norms we must **look outside** the framework of **great power**
competition]{.underline}.

Second, the United States and European allies of Egypt and the Gulf
states need to decide where their priorities lie: [[Does
consistency]{.mark} on global cyber norms **[outweigh]{.mark}** broader
[**security** considerations?]{.mark}]{.underline} If a stable, coherent
set of cyber norms is the primary aim, greater attention should be given
to persuading friendly states to stay within the boundaries of these
norms. However, if [[security]{.mark} alliances [**trump** cyber
norms]{.mark}]{.underline}, Western democracies should recognize that
[the [**rhetorical effect** of denouncing **Russia**]{.mark}n or Chinese
action [will be **limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the United States,
effective foreign policy regarding cyber security in the Middle East
requires both the identification of a clear national interest, connected
to broader strategic goals concerning the kind of cyber space the United
States seeks to promote, and a good understanding of the evolving
landscape in which the U.S. government and U.S. companies are operating.
Right now, both are lacking.

Third, although the contradictions outlined here suggest that human
rights and national security are important starting points for research,
we should not confine cyber security research on these states to these
well-trodden paths. In the Middle East, cyber security is changing
regional alliances, altering the economic calculations of businesses,
and reforging fundamental relationships between individuals and their
governments. [[There are **significant differences** in]{.mark} cyber
security [approaches between]{.mark}]{.underline} these
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially in Kuwait and Qatar. And there
are many new initiatives and organizations, like Saudi Arabia's National
Cyber Security Authority (al-hai'a al-watniyya lil-'amn al-sibrani),
Egypt's High Council for Cybersecurity, the UAE's National Electronic
Security Agency, and Oman's Arab Region Cybersecurity Centre. As our
understanding of cyber security evolves and its connection to other
areas of foreign policy deepens, a broader approach to cyber security
research in this region is urgently needed to adequately understand
these new dynamics and inform future policy choices.

The Necessity of an International Cyberwar Convention

This section presents the case for negotiating an international
convention to govern cyber conflict between states. [Despite growing
threats from actors using ICT for aggressive and illicit purposes, few
treaties address international cyber security issues]{.underline}.
Presently, the main international agreements governing cyber conduct are
the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime (and its Additional Protocol, 2006)
and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's International Information
Security Agreement (2009) (Vihul & Schmitt 2016, 39--40). Both
agreements are severely limited, however, in terms of both their scope
and membership.Footnote17 [Calls for negotiating a comprehensive
international treaty to govern cyber conflict---a so-called E-neva
Convention---have so far met with **disapproval**]{.underline},
especially from Western states (ibid.)Footnote18 To date, the most
elaborate discussions of cyber governance have thus focused on bringing
existing international law to bear on cyber conflict. [The ***[Tallinn
Manual]{.mark}***]{.underline} *on the International Law Applicable to
Cyber Warfare* (2013) [is the most widely cited outcome of such
discussions. This manual [formulates]{.mark} a set of rules [for]{.mark}
how existing **international law**---chiefly *jus ad
bellum*]{.underline}, international humanitarian law [**[(IHL)]{.mark}**
and laws of **state responsibility**---apply in a cyber
context]{.underline} (Talinn Manual 2013; Schmitt and Vihul 2014a, b,
2016; Lucas 2016). [[But]{.mark} while the Tallinn Manual]{.underline}
(hereafter "the Manual") [provides a useful starting point for focusing
attention on the need for stronger international cyber-governance, [its
**practical value**]{.mark} as an instrument [to restrain]{.mark} cyber
conflict [is **modest**]{.mark} for (at least) three reasons.
[First]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Lucas points out (2017, 40), [the Manual
has **generally [failed to gain support outside]{.mark} the narrow group
of [NATO]{.mark} member-states** that sponsored it. [Second, the]{.mark}
Manual does not propose or promulgate new international rules for the
cyber domain but merely offers an **[interp]{.mark}**retation of how
existing laws may apply. So far, this interpretation has **largely
[failed to persuade states to restrain]{.mark} their activities** in the
cyber domain]{.underline} (Lucas 2017, 17). [What is more, the
**[interp]{.mark}**retation [of **many**]{.mark} *jus ad bellum* and
*jus in bello* treaty [provisions]{.mark} as applied to cyber conflict
[remain **unsettled**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 43).
[[Anticipating]{.underline}]{.mark}, as some of the leading legal
scholars behind the Manual do, [that "interpretative [dilemmas]{.mark}
concerning treaty law [will]{.mark} be **[resolve]{.mark}**d
[through]{.mark} the recurrent [practice]{.mark} of states in their
application"]{.underline} (Ibid., 43--44) [[seems
**optimistic**]{.mark}, especially when considering that the
interpretation offered in the Manual has **so far failed to influence
state practice** or opinio juris]{.underline}. Third, even if states
were to agree on the general applicability of jus ad bellum and IHL in
the cyber domain (which presently they do not), such agreement would
hardly suffice. Each one of the international treaties and conventions
currently governing the production, stockpiling, sale, transfer, and use
of specific classes of armaments is testament to the states' recognition
that the general international prohibition on the use of force and IHL
are by themselves insufficient to prevent or restrain international
armed conflict.

#### U.S. restraint [doesn't]{.underline} cause global follow-on

[Nor do cyberattacks against Iran increase the risk of damaging
cyberattacks against the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. It is
true that we are defenseless; efforts to make us safer are hamstrung by
self-interest, ideology and the gridlock of American politics. But [**we
are no more vulnerable today** than we were the day before the news. If
someone decides to attack us, [they may cite]{.mark} Iran as [precedent,
but]{.mark} **it will [only]{.mark} be [to justify a decision
they]{.mark} had [already made]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

We could ask whether the United States creates more problems for itself
when it makes public a new weapon while potential opponents keep it
secret. [Four [other countries can launch]{.mark} sophisticated and
damaging [cyber attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- [including China and
Russia]{.underline} \-- [and **plan to use them** in
warfare]{.underline}. Another **[[30 nations are acquiring]{.mark} cyber
weapons]{.underline}**, including Iran and North Korea.

[[There is a]{.mark} very [old a**rg**]{.mark}ument]{.underline} for
disarmament [[that]{.mark} holds that [if]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[were to renounce]{.mark} some weapons]{.underline} \-- usually nuclear
weapons \-- [[the world would be]{.mark} a [better]{.mark} place.
[This]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[utopianism]{.underline}** [has a revered
place]{.underline}]{.mark} [in American political thinking, [but when
humans invent]{.mark} weapons [they **rarely give**]{.mark} **them
[up]{.mark}**[, especially]{.mark} useful weapons **[who]{.mark}**se
components [are easy to acquire.]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[Cyber]{.mark}attack [is now part]{.mark} of warfare]{.underline}**,
no different from any other weapon. The publicity around Stuxnet may
complicate U.S. efforts to get international rules for the use of
cyberattack, but the White House decided that tampering with Iran's
nuclear program was more important than possible risk to slow-moving
negotiations.

#### Adversaries [only]{.underline} care about balance of power

Journal, July-August 2015,
https://www.airuniversity.af.mil/Portals/10/ASPJ/journals/Volume-29_Issue-4/V-Payne.pdf

Realists in this regard are from Missouri, the "show me" state, and ask
utopians to explain how, why, and when a powerful new cooperative
international norm with corresponding international institutions will
become a reality. [[Realists point to]{.mark} the unhappy history of the
unmet claims and [dashed hopes of]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[1928
[Kellogg-Briand]{.mark} Pact]{.underline}** (intended to prevent
offensive war by global legal agreement), [the]{.underline} [**[League
of Nations]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[the
U]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[nited [N]{.mark}ations]{.underline}**. To be
sure, the future does not have to be bound by the past, but before
moving further toward nuclear disarmament, [realists want to see some
clear evidence of the emerging transformation of the global
order---**not just the claim** that it can occur if all key leaders are
so willing, faithful, and visionary and can "embrace a politics of
impossibility."]{.underline}12 As the old English proverb says, "If
wishes were horses, then beggars would ride." But [has not everything
changed in the twenty-first century?]{.underline} [[Has not the end of
the Cold War ushered in]{.mark} a new [global commitment to
**coop**]{.mark}eration]{.underline}, [the [rule of
law]{.mark}]{.underline} globally, [and benign conflict resolution?
**The [unarguable]{.mark} answer is [no.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
**[[Russian]{.mark} military [actions]{.mark}]{.underline}** against
Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine since 2014 (the latter in direct violation
of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum signed by Russia, Great Britain, and the
United States) are sufficient empirical evidence to demonstrate that
Thucydides' stark description of reality is alive and well.
**[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark}** [expansionist
[claims]{.mark}]{.underline} and military pressure against its neighbors
in the East and South China Seas teach the same lesson. Why is this
reality significant in the consideration of nuclear weapons? Because in
the absence of reliably overturning the powerful norm of raison d'État
and Thucydides' explanation of international relations, states with the
capability and felt need will continue to demand nuclear capabilities
for their own protection and, in some cases, to provide cover for their
expansionist plans. To wit, if Ukraine had retained nuclear weapons,
would it now fear for its survival at the hands of Russian aggression?
Former Ukrainian defense minister Valeriy Heletey and members of the
Ukrainian parliament have made this point explicitly, lamenting
Ukraine's transfer of its nuclear forces to Russia in return for
now-broken security promises of the Budapest Memorandum.13 This lesson
cannot have been lost on other leaders considering the value of nuclear
weapons. Nor is it a coincidence that US allies in Central Europe and
Asia are becoming ever more explicit about their need for US nuclear
assurances under the US extended nuclear deterrent (i.e., the nuclear
umbrella). They see no new emerging, powerful global collective security
regime or cooperative norms that will preserve their security; thus,
they understandably seek the assurance of power, including nuclear
power. The Polish Foreign Ministry observed in a recent press release
that "the current situation reaffirms the importance of NATO's nuclear
deterrence policy."14 [This [reality stands in **stark
contrast**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to **utopian claims**]{.underline}
[that]{.underline}]{.mark} [powerful **new global [norms]{.mark}** and
international institutions [will **reorder the**]{.mark} **international
[system]{.mark}**, overturn Thucydides, and allow individual states to
**dispense with nuclear weapons** or the nuclear protection of a
powerful]{.underline} ally. As the Socialist French president Francois
Hollande has said, "The international context does not allow for any
weakness. . . . The era of nuclear deterrence is therefore not over. . .
. In a dangerous world---and it is dangerous---France does not want to
let down its guard. . . . The possibility of future state conflicts
concerning us directly or indirectly cannot be excluded."15 There could
be no clearer expression of Thucydides' description of international
relations and its contemporary implications for nuclear weapons.
Opponents of the administration's plan to modernize the US triad now
double down on the utopian narrative by insisting that the United States
instead lead the way in establishing the new global norm by showing that
Washington no longer relies on nuclear weapons and does not seek new
ones. Washington cannot expect others to forgo nuclear weapons if it
retains them, they say, and thus it must lead in creation of the new
norm against nuclear weapons by providing an example to the world. For
instance, "by unilaterally reducing its arsenal to a total of 1,000
warheads, the United States would encourage Russia to similarly reduce
its nuclear forces without waiting for arms control negotiations."16 A
good US example supposedly can help "induce parallel" behavior in
others.17 If, however, the United States attributes continuing value to
nuclear weapons by maintaining its arsenal, "other countries will be
more inclined to seek" them.18 Nuclear realists respond, however, that
the United States already has reduced its nuclear forces deeply over the
last 25 years. America cut its tactical nuclear weapons from a few
thousand in 1991 to a "few hundred" today.19 Moreover, US-deployed
strategic nuclear weapons have been cut from an estimated 9,000 in 1992
to roughly 1,600 accountable warheads today, with still more reductions
planned under the New START Treaty.20 The United States has even decided
to be highly revealing of its nuclear capabilities to encourage others
to do so, with no apparent effect on Russia, China, or North Korea.21
America has adhered fully to the reductions and restrictions of the 1987
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty---the "centerpiece of arms
control"---but the Russians now are in open violation. As former
undersec- retary of state Robert Joseph stated recently, decades of deep
US reductions "appear to have had no moderating effect on Russian,
Chinese or North Korean nuclear programs. Neither have U.S. reductions
led to any effective strengthening of international nonproliferation
efforts."22 [**[Utopians]{.underline}** [want]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [to **lead**]{.mark} the world
toward nuclear disarmament [by]{.mark} its [**good example**, but **no
one is following**. The]{.mark} basic [reason]{.mark}, realists point
out, [is]{.mark} that [foreign leaders make decisions]{.mark} about
nuclear weaponry [based]{.mark} largely **[on]{.mark} their countries'
[strategic needs]{.mark}**]{.underline}, raison d'État, [**[not]{.mark}
in deference to [America's penchant]{.mark}** for nuclear disarmament or
some sense of global fairness]{.underline}. A close review of India by
S. Paul Kapur, for example, concluded that "Indian leaders do not seek
to emulate US nuclear behavior; they formulate policy based primarily on
their assessment of the security threats facing India."23 The same
self-interested calculation is true for other nuclear and aspiring
nuclear states. Nations that are a security concern to the United States
seek nuclear weapons to intimidate their neighbors (including US
allies), to counter US conventional forces, and to gain a free hand to
press their regional military ambitions. They see nuclear weapons as
their trump cards and do not follow the US lead in nuclear disarmament.
A bipartisan expert working group at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies concluded accordingly that "U.S. nuclear
reductions have no impact on the calculus of Iran and North Korea."24

[[Despite]{.mark} high levels of]{.underline} Chinese political
harassment and [[**espionage**, there is **little**]{.mark} **evidence**
of **[skill]{.mark}**]{.underline} or subtlety [[in China's]{.mark}
military cyber **[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Although Chinese strategists describe cyberspace as a highly asymmetric
and decisive domain of warfare, [China's military [cyber **capacity**
does **not** live up to]{.mark} its **doctrinal [aspirations]{.mark}**[.
A]{.mark} disruptive [attack]{.mark} on physical infrastructure
[requires **careful testing**]{.mark}, **painstaking
[planning]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} **sophisticated
[intel]{.mark}ligence**. [Even **experienced**]{.mark} U.S. cyber
[operators struggle]{.mark} with these challenges. [By contrast]{.mark},
the [Chinese]{.mark} military [is]{.mark} **rigidly
[hierarchical]{.mark}** [and has **no**]{.mark} **wartime
[experience]{.mark}** with complex information systems. Further, China's
pursuit of military "informatization"]{.underline} (i.e., emulation of
the U.S. network-centric style of operations) [increases its
**dependence** on vulnerable networks and exposure to foreign
cyberattack]{.underline}.

[To be sure, [China]{.mark} engages in aggressive [cyber
campaigns]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially against nongovernmental
organizations and firms less equipped to defend themselves than
government entities. [These activities, however, [**do not** constitute
**major**]{.mark} **military [threats]{.mark}** against the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, and they do nothing to
defend China from the considerable intelligence and military advantages
of the United States.

#### China's [closed]{.underline} system prevents necessary improvements

Jack **Detsch 15**, Editorial Assistant at The Diplomat, Al-Monitor\'s
Pentagon Correspondent, "Are We Exaggerating China's Cyber Threat?", The
Diplomat, 5/20/2015,
https://thediplomat.com/2015/05/are-we-exaggerating-chinas-cyber-threat/

So [[how much should we worry]{.mark} about China's cyber
capabilities?]{.underline}

**[[Not much]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to Professor Jon R.
Lindsay's new policy brief, published by Harvard University's Belfer
Center. Public record on U.S. and Chinese cyber capabilities remains
scant, but Lindsay suggests that the U.S. is gaining an "increasing
advantage," evidenced by a new DARPA program launched in 2012, and the
use of the Stuxnet worm to damage computer systems at an Iranian nuclear
enrichment facility in 2010. In America's private cyber industry, the
name of the game has shifted from defense to offense.

But [[China's interest]{.mark} in]{.underline} developing
[cyber]{.underline} capabilities [[is **political, not
military**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Lindsay argues, prompting incursions
into foreign digitized space to suppress dissent, in the case of GitHub,
or to steal secrets from adversaries. Even so, "lax law enforcement, and
poor cyber defenses leave the country vulnerable to both cybercriminals
and foreign spies," Lindsay notes, suggesting that [China **struggles**
to use the information it comes away with for political
gain]{.underline}. China's successful campaigns target NGOs and private
sector companies, and "do nothing to defend China from the considerable
intelligence and military advantages of the United States."

That doesn't mean that the PLA isn't busy playing catch-up. In a recent
issue of The Science of Military Strategy, put out by the military's
chief research institution, analysts concede that the PLA indeed
possesses network attack forces inside of intelligence and civilian
wings of government, including the Ministry of State Security and the
Ministry of Public Security. It suggests that [the [military will deal
with]{.mark} critical **[infrastructure]{.mark}** targets]{.underline},
like electrical grids and gas pipelines, while smaller, nimbler hacking
units like Axiom, which has been suspected in intrusions against Fortune
500 companies and pro-democracy groups, will focus on industrial
targets.

[[But]{.mark} making [that leap will be **challenging**]{.mark}, and
would force China to walk back its global positions on cybersecurity.
Beijing hopes to become a leader on that front]{.underline} and has been
heavily promoting its concept of "internet sovereignty" as the basis for
international standards of behavior in cyber space. China wants to
defend "internet sovereignty" at all costs. Any future cyber attack
would probably be justified on those grounds.

[That's]{.underline} [[also]{.mark} a **[self-limiting]{.mark}** belief.
While [it]{.mark} has [allowed **home-grown** giants]{.mark} like Weibo,
Alibaba, and Baidu [to flourish]{.mark}, China's [**exclusion** of
American companies]{.mark} and know-how [put it at a **serious
disadvantage**]{.mark} in **[building robust]{.mark} cyber
[capabilities]{.mark}**[. China's]{.mark} own [approach]{.mark} to these
issues could [**prevent** Beijing from **reaching**]{.mark} **its cyber
[potential]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### No US-China cyberwar and no escalation \-\-- the US is too dominant. And, China will [cheat]{.underline}.

\"US-China Relations in Cyberspace: The Benefits and Limits of a Realist
Analysis,\" E-International Relations,
http://www.e-ir.info/2016/08/28/us-china-relations-in-cyberspace-the-benefits-and-limits-of-a-realist-analysis/

[Cyber]{.underline}security [issues]{.underline} [have]{.underline}
increasingly [been singled out as an irritant in the]{.underline} United
States([US)-China bilateral relationship]{.underline}. [US-China
relations in cyberspace **exemplify** tensions in the
**broader**]{.underline} bilateral **[relationship]{.underline}**,
[canvassing **military** competition, **trade** barriers, **intelligence
activity**, and pathways to long-term **economic and political
strength**]{.underline}.\[1\] [However, cybersecurity is still a
**nascent foreign policy issue**]{.underline}. Much of the existing
literature on cybersecurity in international relations addresses the
issue through the lens of policy rather than theory. This paper is a
contribution to bridging the gap between policy and theory. It examines
the extent to which offensive realist theory helps us understand how the
US and China are managing their relations on cybersecurity. I argue that
the US is a hegemon in cyberspace, and China a revisionist power. Based
on that assessment, I consider the likelihood of cyberwar, the issue of
economic espionage, their respective approaches to Internet governance,
and conclude that offensive realism provides a useful framework for
considering security-related issues. However, it cannot explain the full
range of bilateral cyber-related activity, including examples of
cooperation and norm-building in cyberspace. I briefly touch on liberal
theories' ability to explain other elements of the relationship and
conclude that given the breadth of cyber-related issues, an
issue-specific or analytically eclectic approach may be the most
fruitful. The framework for analysis: offensive neorealism Offensive
realism refers to a sub-school of neorealist international relations
theory, which developed from Kenneth Waltz's work on structural
realism.\[2\] The classical realism of thinkers like Hans Morgenthau had
focused on human nature.\[3\] Waltz shifted realism's focus to the
international system, positing that the anarchic structure of the
international system forces states to pursue power to ensure their
survival. Power -- measured by the relative distribution of economic and
military capabilities across the system -- is a state's only guarantee
of security. Subsequently, sub-schools of defensive and offensive
realism have developed based on Waltz's work.\[4\] This paper focuses on
the applicability of John J. Mearsheimer's offensive realism to US-China
cybersecurity relations.\[5\] I have chosen offensive realism as the
basis for my analysis because the relationship is popularly
characterized as conflictual. Offensive neorealism posits that great
powers seek to ensure their security by maximising their share of world
power. Being the dominant power -- a hegemon -- is the best means to
ensure survival. States therefore are "primed for offense".\[6\]
Mearsheimer makes five key assumptions about the international system,
which together cause states to formulate aggressive policies.\[7\] These
are: (1) anarchy is the ordering principle of the international system;
(2) great powers possess some military capability; (3) states can never
be certain about other states' intentions; (4) survival is the primary
goal of great powers; and (5) that great powers are rational
actors.\[8\] I will treat these assumptions as given for the purposes of
my analysis. Combined, these factors result in three patterns of
behaviour: fear, self-help, and power maximisation.\[9\] Unable to trust
other states, and aware that they operate in a self-help system, states
view becoming the most powerful states in the system as the best way to
ensure survival.\[10\] States look to maximise their power and alter the
balance of power using a variety of tools -- even if doing so makes
other states suspicious or hostile.\[11\] Capability is what matters,
given the intentions of other states are uncertain. States will lie,
cheat and use force if it can help them gain an advantage.\[12\] All
great powers will have revisionist tendencies until they achieve
hegemony, resulting in constant security competition.\[13\] Finally, in
Mearsheimer's view, multipolar systems are more likely to result in
conflict than bipolar systems, and multipolar systems with an emerging
hegemon are the most dangerous ("unbalanced multipolarity").\[14\] What
is the current balance of power in cyberspace? In order [to understand
whether there is a security competition in cyberspace, it is necessary
to **assess the current balance of power**.]{.underline} Because I am
considering cybersecurity in isolation from the wider bilateral
relationship this analysis necessarily will be artificial, focusing only
on relative cyberpower (broadly defined). [Mearsheimer defines a hegemon
as a "state that is so powerful that it dominates all the other states
in the system."]{.underline}\[15\] A state that is substantially more
powerful than other powers in the system is not a hegemon -- a hegemon
is the only great power.\[16\] Mearsheimer concludes that it is
virtually impossible for a state to become a global power because of the
difficulties in projecting power across the world's oceans.\[17\]
However, **[the US]{.underline}** arguably **[has hegemonic power in
cyberspace]{.underline}**, [where geographic boundaries **do not affect
power projection**]{.underline}. [The US, thanks to its role in the
Internet's creation and development, retains a **huge amount of
influence** over its operations and governance]{.underline}. [Ten of the
Internet's 13 root servers are on US soil, and China, like many other
states, is still **reliant on technology from American
firms**]{.underline} like Microsoft.\[18\] Secondly, the US is generally
believed to have the most significant cyber offensive capabilities in
the world. [While cyber capability is shrouded in secret, the US is
likely to]{.underline} [have]{.underline} a **[good chance at dominating
other great powers in cyberspace]{.underline}**. [The question
is]{.underline} then [whether there are any other great powers in
cyberspace. China has arguably risen as a cyber power]{.underline},
though its (known) activities to date are computer-network exploitation
for intelligence rather than attacks causing disruption.\[19\] China
sees cyber power as a cost effective, long range way to counter a
superior adversary in conflict.\[20\] China has also become increasingly
influential in global policy debates on Internet governance issues, as
will be discussed below. [However, [the US has]{.mark} considerably
[more **experience**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in]{.underline}
**[managing]{.underline}**]{.mark} complex **[[network
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and the P]{.mark}eoples'
[L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy [faces]{.mark} **sizeable
[challenges]{.mark}** implementing cyber tactics]{.underline}.\[21\]
[Cyberspace also is not]{.underline} a simple [bipolar]{.underline}
world. [Russia]{.underline}, for instance, [is]{.underline} widely
[considered to be one of the most capable actors in
cyberspace]{.underline} and is believed to have deployed offensive cyber
capability in support of its wider objectives (most recently shutting
down a power grid in the Ukraine). Cyber capabilities also are
proliferating widely, in part because of low barriers to entry.\[22\]
Cyberspace therefore can loosely be characterized as a multipolar
system. [In an unbalanced multipolar system, we should expect to see an
ongoing **security competition**]{.underline}, based on calculations of
relative state power. [The US will seek to check China's
activity]{.underline} to maintain its hegemony. [China, as an aspiring
hegemon and revisionist power, will **use force to alter the status quo
if the benefits outweigh the costs.**]{.underline}\[23\] The polarity of
the system will make states fearful and security competition is likely
to be particularly acute in the cyber context. The secrecy shrouding
states' cyber capabilities makes it difficult to measure relative
capability, which will increase suspicion. A spiral of mistrust --
should we expect the outbreak of cyberwar? [Relations between the US and
China indeed have been marked by fear and mistrust]{.underline}. Growing
concerns about competitive advantage have exacerbated that mistrust,
along with ongoing intelligence activities and political rhetoric. China
is suspicious that the US is using its dominance in cyberspace to
undermine other states, which suggests a sense of vulnerability, and US
has a deep sense of unease about a rising China.\[24\] Offensive realism
suggests that how much states fear each other determines the severity of
their security competition as well as the likelihood that they will
fight a war.\[25\] As signaled above, [states cannot accurately assess
their **relative cyberpower**]{.underline} [because offensive cyber
capabilities tend to be **highly classified**]{.underline}. Fear has
therefore driven both states to invest in offensive and defensive
capabilities.\[26\] [There is]{.underline} also [an incentive for both
to **misrepresent their strength**, so the **true balance of power** is
**unclear**]{.underline}.\[27\] This may lead to a misperception of
dominance, particularly when the effectiveness of 'cyberweapons' is
poorly understood.\[28\] [However, a [cyber conflict]{.mark} between the
US and China [is **highly unlikely**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Examples of
attacks with destructive]{.mark} or physical [consequences are]{.mark}
still very [rare]{.mark}]{.underline} (although the number may be
increasing). Since the late 1980s, there have been 61 attacks conducted
by states against during peacetime, and 24 during wartime.\[29\]
Examples include Russian attacks on Georgia in 2008 and the infamous
Stuxnet attack on Iranian nuclear infrastructure (usually attributed to
the US and Israel).\[30\] [[**No state** has]{.mark} ever
[declared]{.mark} a '[cyberwar']{.mark}]{.underline}.\[31\] This is
[partly because to develop sophisticated attacks like Stuxnet is very
difficult]{.underline}, requiring high levels of technical
expertise.\[32\] [**[Attribution]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[also notoriously [difficult]{.mark}]{.underline} in cyberspace. It is
extremely tough to trace attacks and states may also use proxy or
non-state actors, further confusing the issue.\[33\] [Until recently,
the failure to develop an effective deterrence policy has been related
to the difficulty in attributing cyberattacks. Nevertheless, [the US
has]{.mark} "[reserve\[d\] the right to use all]{.mark} necessary
[means]{.mark} -- diplomatic, informational, military, and economic --
as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law" [to
respond]{.mark} to hostile acts in cyberspace.\[]{.underline}34\] China
has not used 'force' against the US in cyberspace [but it is clear that
cyberattacks would feature in any broader military clash. [Difficulties
arise in considering]{.mark} what constitutes a **[proportionate
response]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}
**[low-level]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[attacks]{.underline}** [like
**[hacking]{.mark}** or **cybercrime**]{.underline}. [[It is **very
unlikely that any incident**]{.mark} **of that nature [could justify
a]{.mark} traditional [military response]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[35\]
[To date, [countermeasures]{.mark} have [fall]{.mark}en **[well
below]{.mark} the use of [military force]{.mark}**. [The US]{.mark} has
[instead relied on **diplomatic** and **law enforcement tools**]{.mark}:
**attribution**, [**indictments**, and]{.mark} the **threat of
[sanctions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[36\] Cyber-enabled espionage -- a
constant, low level conflict? Intense security competition between the
US and China is much more evident when considering the issue of
cyber-enabled espionage. As a trading state, China has benefited from
Internet connectivity, but it is still a net importer of advanced
technology.\[37\] To maintain high growth levels in an innovation-driven
world, economic espionage is a useful shortcut, and economic power is
fungible.\[38\] The US has consistently alleged that China is conducting
economic espionage on a massive scale to support Chinese firms. Good
evidence exists to support this allegation. For instance, one study
found that "96 percent of recorded, state-affiliated attacks targeting
businesses' trade secrets and other intellectual property in 2012 could
be traced by to Chinese hackers."\[39\] While each loss might be small,
the net effect has been described as "the most significant transfer of
wealth in history."\[40\] In response, China has consistently accused
the US of hypocrisy, supported by evidence in the Snowden disclosures of
the extent to which the US had penetrated a range of Chinese companies
and networks.\[41\] Chinese officials point out that China is the
largest victim of cyber attacks in the world, many emanating from the
US.\[42\] In China's view, the US has no "moral standing" to make
accusations against China or define norms of appropriate behaviour
online.\[43\] Despite this, the US has attempted to draw a distinction
between espionage for national security purposes and economic espionage
for the benefit of a states' firms (such as China's state-owned
enterprises). While China has historically refused to acknowledge this
distinction, US policy has been calibrated both to develop this norm and
to raise the costs of Chinese activity. Until recently, actions in
cyberspace had been largely penalty-free. Over the last two years, the
US has executed the first steps in a new strategy to change the
cost-benefit-risk calculus for its cyber adversaries.\[44\] In May 2014,
the Department of Justice indicted of five members of the Chinese
Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA) for hacking and commercial espionage
against major US companies.\[45\] Following the high-profile hack of
Sony pictures in December 2014, the US attributed the attack to North
Korean actors -- the first time that the US had publicly attributed an
attack on a US company to a foreign government.\[46\] Then, in April
2015, President Obama signed an executive order allowing the US to
impose severe financial restrictions on individuals or entities who
engage in or benefit from cyber-enabled economic espionage.\[47\] In
advance of President Xi Jinping's first state visit to the US in 2015,
there were serious indications that the Obama administration might
impose sanctions against China in a second major volley on economic
espionage.\[48\] Shortly before the visit, Obama described theft of
intellectual property and trade secrets as an "act of aggression" and a
"core national security threat".\[49\] [Despite previously refusing to
accept the US distinction between 'acceptable' espionage]{.underline}
for national security [and 'unacceptable']{.underline} economic
espionage, President [Xi reached a landmark agreement with]{.underline}
President [Obama]{.underline} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} September
[[2015]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The two leaders agreed that
"neither]{.underline} country's government [will conduct or knowingly
support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property]{.underline},
including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with
the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or
commercial sectors."\[50\]\[51\] [The agreement was an unexpected
reversal of the Chinese position.]{.underline} Offensive realism
suggests that China may have signed the agreement for two reasons.
Threatened with sanctions, China made a rational choice -- the costs of
cyber activity against the US were rising and it was in China's interest
to agree. More pessimistically, [[China]{.mark} may also have [signed
with **no intention of adhering**]{.mark}]{.underline} to the agreement.
[Offensive realism suggests that]{.underline} concerns about
[**[cheating will hinder coop]{.mark}eration**, [as states
**fear**]{.mark} that [the other]{.mark} side [will cheat]{.mark},
putting them at a disadvantage]{.underline}. \[52\] [**Subsequent
[evidence]{.mark}** [suggests]{.mark} that [China is **not
complying**]{.mark} with the agreement]{.underline}. [The Director of
National Intelligence noted]{.underline} in February 2016 [that "China
continues to have success in cyber espionage against the U.S.
government, our allies, and U.S. companies.]{.underline}"\[53\]
[Continuing Chinese activity suggests that the US **has not succeeded in
raising the real costs of economic espionage**]{.underline}. The costs
of an indictment and the threat of sanctions are slight in comparison to
the benefits China is reaping from its economic espionage
practices.\[54\] Cheating on a cyber agreement may also be simpler
because deception is a core part of network intrusions.\[55\] As long as
the benefits to China outweigh the risks, there is no reason to stop.
[For the US, it appears that more significant punishments may be too
costly or escalatory to pursue.]{.underline}\[56\] Some of this
reluctance likely derives from concerns about damaging relations with a
state with a major economic market.\[57\]

### No China War\-\--1NC

#### No US-China war. 

Cui **Lei 20**, PhD and MA in International Politics, associate research
fellow with the China Institute of International Studies, \"Despite
heated talk, risk of a US-China hot war is small\", South China Morning
Post, 7-24-2020,
https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3094121/why-risk-us-china-hot-war-small-despite-heated-talk

[Many]{.underline} observers [are pessimistic about deteriorating
US-China relations and believe the two countries are **heading
towards**]{.underline} a cold **[war]{.underline}**. Even worse, [some
argue that the situation might be **more dangerous** than the US-Soviet
Union Cold War, and that a **hot war might break out** between the two.
This argument is **unconvincing**]{.underline}.

**[First]{.underline}** of all, [[**deterrents** to a flare-up
are]{.underline}]{.mark} much **[[strong]{.underline}]{.mark}**er [**[in
US-China relations]{.mark}** than in US-Soviet relations]{.underline}.
Although economic and people-to-people ties between China and the US are
declining, they are still close compared to US-Soviet ties. [[It is
**hard to decouple**]{.mark} two **[closely intertwined
economies]{.mark}** and **societies**.]{.underline}

Take two examples. [[China]{.mark} [is]{.mark} expected to become [the
world\'s **largest**]{.mark} **consumer [market]{.mark}**, a temptation
**hard to resist** for exporters, **including** those from the US. And
in **education**, more than **300,000 Chinese students** study in the
US, bringing in **huge revenues** for the US education
industry]{.underline}.

Many universities go to great lengths to woo international students.
Recently Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology even sued
the government over its new visa restrictions, now aborted, on
international students.

[Second, **even if** there is decoupling, the pain would **not be too
great** and can be **kept out** of the **national security
sphere**]{.underline} if properly handled. In fact, for national
security reasons, a modest degree of isolation will make both sides more
secure and comfortable. For instance, if China's information technology
equipment cannot capture Western markets, the US will be more relaxed.
If China cannot get advanced technologies from the US and its
technological progress slows down, the US will be less anxious.

In the same vein, China feels assured knowing that if the Trump
administration does impose a travel ban on Communist Party members, it
would be abandoning one of the tools available to the US to promote
"peaceful evolution" in China.

Economic decoupling is undeniably more painful for China than for the
US. But unlike Japan during WWII, which was hit hard by the US oil
embargo because of its lack of natural resources, China has no such
problems. Given its large domestic market, losing the US as a major
customer is not a disaster for China, and can be compensated through
more dynamic economic activities at home. China can also make up for
being freezed out of technological exchanges by turning to indigenous
innovation.

As for the US, it can import goods from other developing countries,
albeit less cheaply. The relative loss is acceptable when weighed
against the heightened perception of economic independence and security.

[Third, the ideological confrontation between China and the US is **less
intense**]{.underline} than that during the Cold War. Unlike the
obsession with ideology in those days, [the line between capitalism and
socialism is **blurred** today. The **market economy** has become
**universally recognised** as the best way to promote economic
growth]{.underline} and, politically, many countries have embraced
democracy. Even North Korea calls itself the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.

Although ideological hawks in the US still long for the day when the
beacon of freedom will light up the world, [after **many years** of
fighting **bloody wars overseas**, most American people are **not
interested** in promoting democracy abroad]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
[China just wants to **preserve its political system** and has **no
interest in exporting it** to other countries, as the Soviet Union
did.]{.underline}

[Thus, ideological **antagonism** in China-US relations can easily be
**eased** by calculations of realistic **interests**, which create
conditions for **compromise and cooperation**.]{.underline}

[**Fourth**, both [China and the US have]{.mark} **many [options other
than war]{.mark}** to achieve their policy goals]{.underline}. While
they have no allies to serve as a buffer, given the nature of the
potential conflict in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait,
[[both]{.mark} countries [are **adept at operating in grey
zones**]{.mark} and fighting psychological, public opinion or diplomatic
warfare **below the threshold of war**]{.underline}. The forced closure
of the Chinese consulate in Houston by the US government is just the
latest act of brinkmanship.

In addition, [given China's huge economic and financial interests in
[the US]{.mark}, the latter [can **wield**]{.mark} **the stick of
[sanctions]{.mark}** when use of force is **highly risky** or not worth
it.]{.underline} [[When both]{.mark} sides [have **many tools**]{.mark}
**and options,** [why would they **rush to war**]{.mark} to achieve
their goals?]{.underline}

**[Last]{.underline}** but not least, [the **imbalance of power** will
act as a deterrent]{.underline}. Some say the US and Soviet Union did
not fight a hot war because they were evenly matched. It was not the
case, actually. At the beginning of the Cold War, the Soviet Union was
at a relative military disadvantage.

Moreover, [[a country needs]{.mark} the [**will to fight** before
**going to war**]{.mark}**,** even if it is stronger militarily than its
adversary. [Having fought **years of meaningless wars**, the US is
**weary**]{.mark} **of war**]{.underline}.

[China, too, **abhors war**. Having a **clear understanding** of US
strength, **especially** [when its]{.mark} own [economy is
**slowing**]{.mark} **down** [and]{.mark} [it is facing]{.mark}
**various [domestic challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[China would
**not**]{.mark} **wish** to **[recklessly start a war]{.mark} with the
US**.]{.underline}

[In summary, the possibility of a **hot war** between China and the US
is **very small**]{.underline}. The greatest danger for China is not a
cold or hot confrontation with the US, but policymakers' interpretation
of the momentary hostility towards Beijing of a portion of the American
population and the larger world. An erroneous interpretation could end
China's march to further opening up, and see it turn instead towards
self-isolation.

### No China War\-\--2NC

#### No US-China war

True, throughout history, when a rising power has challenged a ruling
one, war has often been the result. But there are notable exceptions. [A
war between the US and China]{.underline} today [is no more inevitable
than]{.underline} was war between [the]{.underline} rising [US
and]{.underline} the declining [**U**nited **K**ingdom a century
ago]{.underline}. And in today's context, there are four compelling
reasons to believe that war between the US and China can be avoided.

First and foremost, any [military conflict]{.underline} between the two
[would quickly turn **nuc**lear]{.underline}. The US thus finds itself
in the same situation that it was in vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. Taiwan
could easily become this century's tripwire, just as the "Fulda Gap" in
Germany was during the Cold War. But the same dynamic of
"[**[m]{.mark}**utual **[a]{.mark}**ssured
**[d]{.mark}**estruction"]{.underline} that limited US-Soviet conflict
**[[applies to the US and China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And [the
[international community]{.mark} would do everything]{.underline} in its
power [to [ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that a potential
[**[nuc]{.mark}**lear [conflict did not
materialize]{.mark},]{.underline} [given]{.underline} that [the
consequences]{.underline} would be fundamentally transnational and --
unlike climate change -- immediate.

A **[US-China [conflict]{.mark} would]{.underline}** almost certainly
**[[take the form of a proxy war]{.mark}, rather than a major-power
confrontation]{.underline}**. [Each]{.underline} superpower [might take
a different side in a domestic conflict]{.underline} in a country such
as Pakistan, Venezuela, Iran, or North Korea, [and
[deploy]{.mark}]{.underline} some combination of [[economic, cyber, and
diplomatic instruments]{.underline}]{.mark}. We have seen this type of
conflict many times before: from Vietnam to Bosnia, the US faced
surrogates rather than its principal foe.

Second, it is important to remember that, historically, **[[China plays
a long game]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although Chinese military power has
grown dramatically, [it]{.underline} still [[lags behind the US
on]{.mark} almost [every measure]{.mark} that matters]{.underline}. And
while China is investing heavily in [[asymmetric
equalizers]{.underline}]{.mark} (long-range anti-ship and hypersonic
missiles, military applications of cyber, and more), it [[will not
match]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[US]{.underline}]{.mark} in
[[conventional means]{.underline}]{.mark} such as aircraft and large
ships [for decades, if ever.]{.underline}

A [[head-to-head conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} with the US
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[be **too dangerous for
China**]{.mark} to countenance at its current stage of
development]{.underline}. If such a conflict did occur, China would have
few options but to let the nuclear genie out of the bottle. In thinking
about baseline scenarios, therefore, we should give less weight to any
scenario in which the Chinese consciously precipitate a military
confrontation with America. The US military, however, tends to plan for
worst-case scenarios and is currently focused on a potential direct
conflict with China -- a fixation with overtones of the US-Soviet
dynamic.

This raises the risk of being blindsided by other threats. Time and
again since the Korean War, asymmetric threats have proven the most
problematic to national security. Building a force that can handle the
worst-case scenario does not guarantee success across the spectrum of
warfare.

The third reason to think that a Sino-American conflict can be avoided
is that [China is already [chalking up victories in]{.mark}
the]{.underline} global [[soft-power]{.mark} war]{.underline}.
Notwithstanding accusations that COVID-19 escaped from a virology lab in
Wuhan, [China]{.underline} has [[emerged from the pandemic
looking]{.underline}]{.mark} much [[better than the
US]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [with]{.underline} its [**B**elt and
**R**oad **I**nitiative]{.underline} to finance infrastructure
development around the world, [it]{.underline} has [aggressively stepped
into the void left by US retrenchment]{.underline} during Donald Trump's
four-year presidency. **[China's [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}** may
very well **[look at the]{.underline}** current [**s**tatus **quo**
**and [conclude]{.mark}**]{.underline} that **[[they are on the
right]{.mark}]{.underline}** strategic **[[path]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Finally, **[[China and the US are deeply intertwined]{.mark}
economically]{.underline}**. Despite Trump's trade war, Sino-American
bilateral trade in 2020 was around \$650 billion, and [China was
[America's largest]{.mark} [trade partner]{.mark}]{.underline}. The two
countries' [[supply-chain linkages are vast]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[China holds more]{.mark} than \$1 trillion in US
[Treasuries]{.mark}]{.underline}, most of [[which it cannot]{.mark}
easily [unload]{.mark}]{.underline}, lest it reduce their value and
incur massive losses.

To be sure, logic can be undermined by a single act and its unintended
consequences. Something as simple as a miscommunication can escalate a
proxy war into an interstate conflagration. And as the situations in
Afghanistan and Iraq show, America's track record in war-torn countries
is not encouraging. China, meanwhile, has dramatically stepped up its
foreign interventions. Between its expansionist mentality, its growing
foreign-aid program, and rising nationalism at home, China could all too
easily launch a foreign intervention that might threaten US interests.

Cyber mischief, in particular, could undercut conventional military
command-and-control systems, forcing leaders into bad decisions if more
traditional options are no longer on the table. And Sino-American
economic ties may come to matter less than they used to, especially as
China moves from an export-led growth model to one based on domestic
consumption, and as two-way investment flows decline amid escalating
bilateral tensions.

[A "[mistake]{.mark}"]{.underline} on the part of either country
[[is]{.mark} always [possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is why
**[[diplomacy is essential]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Each country needs to
determine its vital national interests vis-à-vis the other, and both
need to consider the same question from the other's perspective. For
example, it may be hard to accept (and unpopular to say), but civil
rights within China might not be a vital US national interest. By the
same token, China should understand that the US does indeed have vital
interests in Taiwan.

[The US and China are destined to clash in many ways.]{.underline} But a
direct, **[interstate war need not be one of them]{.underline}**.

#### No US/China War

Relations at Boston University. The 'new Cold War' with China is Way
Overblown. Here's Why. 2/8/2019.

[Is a **[new Cold War]{.mark}** looming]{.underline} --- or already
present --- [between the **U**nited **S**tates and
**China**?]{.underline} Many analysts argue that a combination of
geopolitics, ideology and competing visions of "global order" are
driving the two countries toward emulating the Soviet-U.S. rivalry that
dominated world politics from 1947 through 1990.

But [such [concerns are **overblown**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here are
four big reasons why.

1\. The [historical backdrops of the]{.underline} two [relationships
are]{.underline} very [different]{.underline}

[When the Cold War began, the U.S.-Soviet relationship was
fragile]{.underline} and tenuous. Bilateral diplomatic relations were
barely a decade old, U.S. intervention in the Russian Revolution was a
recent memory, and the Soviet Union had called for the overthrow of
capitalist governments into the 1940s. Despite their Grand Alliance
against Nazi Germany, the two countries shared few meaningful
diplomatic, economic or institutional links.

[[In **2019**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the situation between the
**U**nited **S**tates and **China** is **very different**]{.underline}.
Since the 1970s, [[**diplomatic** interactions, **institutional ties**
and **economic flows**]{.mark} have all
**[exploded]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Although each]{.underline}]{.mark}
[side has **[criticized]{.mark} the other**]{.underline} for domestic
interference (such as U.S. demands for journalist access to Tibet and
China's espionage against U.S. corporations), [these [issues **did not
prevent coop**]{.mark}eration on a host of **other
issues**]{.underline}. [Yes, there were [tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}
over the past decade, [but these [occurred against a]{.mark} **generally
[cooperative]{.mark}** [backdrop]{.mark}]{.underline}.

2\. Geography and powers' nuclear postures suggest East Asia is more
stable than Cold War-era Europe

The Cold War was shaped by an intense arms race, nuclear posturing and
crises, especially in continental Europe. Given Europe's political
geography, the United States feared a "bolt from the blue" attack would
allow the Soviet Union to conquer the continent. Accordingly, the United
States prepared to defend Europe with conventional forces, and to deter
Soviet aggrandizement using nuclear weapons.

Unsurprisingly, the Soviet Union also feared that the United States
might attack and wanted to deter U.S. adventurism. Concerns that the
other superpower might use force and that crises could quickly escalate
colored Cold War politics.

Today, [the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and **China**
spend]{.mark} **proportionally [far less]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} their
[**militaries** than]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[and]{.mark} the [Soviet Union]{.mark} did]{.underline}. Though an arms
race may be emerging, [U.S. and Chinese [**nuclear postures** are
**not**]{.mark} nearly [as **large or
threatening**]{.mark}]{.underline}[: **[Arsenals]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[remain **far below** the **size and scope** witnessed in the Cold
War]{.underline}, and [[are **kept** at a **lower**]{.mark} state of
**[alert]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[As for **geography**]{.underline}, [**East [Asia]{.mark}** [is **not
primed** for **tensions**]{.mark} akin to those in Cold War
Europe]{.underline}. China can threaten to coerce its neighbors, but the
[**[water barriers]{.mark}** separating China from most of Asia's
strategically important states [make]{.mark} outright
**[conquest]{.mark}** significantly **[harder]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of
course, as scholars such as Caitlin Talmadge and Avery Goldstein note,
[crises may still erupt]{.underline}, and each side may face pressures
to escalate. Unlike the Cold War, [however, **U.S.-Chinese
[confrontations]{.mark}** [occur at **sea** with]{.mark} relatively
**[limited forces]{.mark}** and **[without]{.mark}** clear
**[territorial boundaries]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
suggests [there are **[countervailing factors]{.mark}** that may
[give]{.mark} the two sides **[room to negotiate]{.mark}**]{.underline}
--- [[and **limit**]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[speed]{.underline}]{.mark}** [with which a **[crisis
unfolds]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

3\. The Cold War had just two major powers

The Cold War took place in a bipolar system, with the United States and
Soviet Union uniquely powerful, compared with other nations. This
dynamic often pushed the United States and the U.S.S.R. toward
confrontation and contributed to more or less fixed alliances; moreover,
it encouraged efforts to suppress prospective great powers, such as
Germany.

In 2019, it's not at all clear we are back to bipolarity. Analysts
remain divided over whether the U.S. unipolar era is waning (or is
already over) --- and, if so, whether we are heading for a new period of
bipolarity, modern-day multipolarity or something else. Regardless, most
analysts accept that **[[other countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** will
play a central role [in East Asia]{.underline}n security affairs.

Russia, for example, still benefits from legacy military investments,
India is developing economically and militarily, and Japan is beginning
to build highly capable military forces to complement its
still-significant economic might. Even if these nations aren't as
powerful as the United States or China, their presence [[makes]{.mark}
for [more **fluid diplomatic arrangements**]{.mark} and more **diffuse
security concerns**]{.underline} than during the U.S.-Soviet
competition. The resulting security dynamics are therefore likely to
look very different.

4\. Ideology plays less of a role in U.S.-Chinese relations

Many people see the Cold War as an ideological contest between
U.S.-backed liberalism and Soviet-backed communism. But that's not the
whole story.

The early 20th century saw liberalism, communism and fascism vie for
ideological preeminence. With fascism defeated alongside Nazi Germany,
the postwar stage was set for a struggle between communism and
liberalism to reinforce the U.S.-Soviet contest. That each ideology
claimed universal scope ensured that the ideologies served as rallying
cries for Third World conflicts, which were subsequently associated with
the U.S.-Soviet struggle.

[The respective "**[ideologies]{.mark}**" of the **U**nited **S**tates
and **China** [do not favor]{.mark}]{.underline} this type of
**[[contest]{.underline}]{.mark}** today. Indeed, analysts calling for a
hard-line stance against China have faced difficulties even identifying
a coherent Chinese ideological alternative. And while some researchers
claim that a nascent ideological contest pitting an "autocratic" China
against the "liberal" United States is emerging, this narrative ignores
the political contests that shape Chinese politics (and have parallels
in U.S. politics). Autocracies and democracies often cooperate. And on
one important ideological issue --- how they organize their economic
lives --- [China and the **U**nited **S**tates have both **embraced**
economic **growth** via trade]{.underline}, [the private sector and
semi-free markets]{.underline}.

LESS RELEVANT REGION In response to the Iraq war, the United States has
aimed to reduce its role in the Middle East. Three factors have made
that course both more alluring and more possible. First, [inter[state
conflicts that]{.mark} **directly [threatened]{.mark}** [U.S.]{.mark}
interests]{.underline} in the past [[have]{.mark} **largely [been
replaced]{.mark}** [by **substate**]{.mark} **security
[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, **[[other]{.mark} rising
[regions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially Asia, [[have taken on more
importance]{.underline}]{.mark} to U.S. global strategy. And third,
[**the [diversification of]{.mark} global [energy]{.mark} markets** [has
weakened oil]{.mark} as a driver]{.underline} of U.S. policy. [[During
the Cold War, traditional]{.mark} state]{.underline}-based [[threats
pushed]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to play
**[a]{.mark} major [role]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Middle East. That
role involved not only ensuring the stable supply of energy to Western
markets but also working to prevent the spread of communist influence
and tamping down the Arab-Israeli conflict so as to help stabilize
friendly states. These [[efforts were]{.mark} **largely
[successful]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Beginning in the 1970s, the United
States nudged Egypt out of the pro-Soviet camp, oversaw the first
Arab-Israeli peace treaty, and solidified its hegemony in the region.
[Despite challenges]{.underline} from Iran after its 1979 revolution and
from Saddam Hussein's Iraq throughout the 1990s, [U.S. dominance was
never]{.underline} seriously [in question. The

among]{.underline}]{.mark} the Gulf [[Arab states. Thanks to]{.mark}
**all [these]{.mark} efforts**, the [chances of]{.mark}]{.underline}
deliberate [interstate [war]{.mark} in the Middle East
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps [**[lower]{.mark} now** [than]{.mark}

#### No Middle East war\-\--[deterrence]{.underline}. 

Helena **Cobban 19**, MA, Senior Fellow at the Center for International
Policy, 10-13-2019, \"Mutual Deterrence: Good for the Middle East, Bad
for the Nuclear Weapons Industry?\", LobeLog,
https://lobelog.com/mutual-deterrence-good-for-the-middle-east-bad-for-the-nuclear-weapons-industry/

Over the past three-plus months it has become increasingly clear that,
[despite the bombast that]{.underline} Pres. Donald [Trump has hurled
against]{.underline} the Islamic Republic of [Iran]{.underline} (along
with a full deck of extremely harmful sanctions and some cyber attacks),
[neither **he** nor his **closest regional allies**]{.underline} [in the
anti-Iran coalition have been **willing to escalate** to any military
attack against Iran that could **escalate to all-out war**]{.underline}.

[Might [the Mid]{.mark}dle [East]{.mark} now be [see]{.mark}ing the
emergence of]{.underline} a situation of [**[mutual
deterrence]{.underline}** [that could]{.underline}
**[bring]{.underline}**]{.mark} it some much-needed
**[[stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- and that could also put the
long-vaunted "value" of nuclear weapons into deep question?

Let's do a quick recap. On June 20, [[Iranian forces shot down a]{.mark}
large [U.S.]{.mark} Reaper Hawk [drone]{.mark}]{.underline} that had
almost certainly ventured into Iranian airspace. [[The military
reaction]{.mark} from the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[Saudi]{.underline} Arabia, [Israel]{.underline}, [and the
U]{.underline}nited [A]{.underline}rab [E]{.underline}mirates? As I
noted here a few weeks later: **[[goose egg]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Then
on September 14, either Iranian allies or [Iran]{.underline} itself
[launched a **large-scale**]{.underline}, stunningly intricate
**[attack]{.underline}** [against Saudi]{.underline} Arabia['s oil
complex]{.underline} at Abqaiq. **[More goose egg]{.underline}**.

Along the way, in late August, Israel killed two fighters affiliated
with Iran's Lebanese ally, [Hizbullah]{.underline}, in Syria and [sent
explosive drones]{.underline} [against]{.underline} two
Hizbullah-related [targets inside Lebanon]{.underline}. The Hizbullah
chief warned publicly that the organization would retaliate against
Israel. [Israel's response? Its military leaders organized a very
**public withdrawal**]{.underline} of their forces from a strip along
the country's northern border with Lebanon. Then, after Hizbullah indeed
launched a quick missile strike against an Israeli military vehicle
fleeing deeper into Israel, the [Israelis' only response was to shoot a
few pieces of **ordnance**]{.underline}, [seemingly at
**random**]{.underline}, [into **uninhabited parts** of southern
Lebanon.]{.underline}

In an analysis of the incident and its background that I published
September 5, I noted that, "[the situation of
**reciprocal**]{.underline} (if highly asymmetrical)
**[deterrence]{.underline}** [that has existed between Israel and
Hizbullah]{.underline} since ... 2006 **[remains in
place]{.underline}**."

Now, in the aftermath of the Abqaiq attacks, it is clearer than ever
that a situation of **[mutual]{.underline}** (if asymmetrical)
**[[deterrence exists]{.underline}]{.mark}** [not just between Israel
and Hizbullah]{.underline} over the Lebanon-Israel border,
[but]{.underline} also **[more [broadly in the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}** between Israel and Hizbullah's backers in
Iran.

In Israel, nuclear scientist Uzi Even recently assessed the capabilities
the Iranians or their allies revealed during the Abqaiq attack:

> [The Iranian technology is **reliable**]{.underline} and
> **[advanced]{.underline}**, and the Iranians are capable of producing
> and operating simultaneously a large number of drones and cruise
> missiles.

He argued that,

> Either the Saudi defense system failed or communication between the
> Iranian missiles was hidden and hard to discover. Either way, the
> attack was successful and effective... [The
> [Iran]{.mark}ians]{.underline}, or their proxies, [[showed]{.mark}
> that [they can **hit**]{.mark} **specific [targets]{.mark}** [with
> **great precision**]{.mark} and from a distance of **hundreds of
> kilometers**]{.underline}. We have to accept the fact that we are now
> vulnerable to such a strike. Yes, we can also carry out such strikes
> and perhaps inflict great damage on them, but so what? Does rational
> deterrence always work in the Middle East?

He also argued that,

> above all... operation of \[Israel's\] Dimona nuclear reactor should
> be halted. It has now been shown to be vulnerable, and the harm it
> could cause would likely exceed its benefits.

For the staunchly pro-war and pro-Israel New York Times columnist Thomas
Friedman, the main takeaway from Even's analysis was that:

> Israel has been signaling two things to Hezbollah and Iran. One is
> that in response to any missile attacks, Israel will carpet bomb
> neighborhoods in Lebanon where Hezbollah's families live and where it
> manufactures the missiles, and turn them into rubble, as it did on a
> small scale in 2006. And it will make the Lebanese economy collateral
> damage.
>
> And the other is that Israel will attack Tehran directly, either with
> precision long-range missiles from Israel or submarine-launched
> missiles from the Persian Gulf, with this message: "Every time Tel
> Aviv is hit by your proxies, we will hit Tehran. You will not sit out
> this war. And you will not out-crazy us."

Notably, neither of these "signals" seemed to be ones that Friedman
disagreed with, or had any problem with. But his analysis of the crucial
war that Hizbullah and Israel fought in 2006 also seemed badly askew:
the bombing that Israel carried out that year of the "neighborhoods in
Lebanon where Hizbullah's families live" --- and indeed, of numerous key
elements of the country's vital national infrastructure --- was
extremely far from "small-scale." It was truly monumental. Yet Hizbullah
not only survived it, it survived it with its standing in Lebanon's
political system significantly enhanced and with the Israeli ground
units that had attempted a broad invasion of the country racing back as
fast as they could to Israel with their tails between their legs.

[Hizbullah's performance in 2006 reaffirmed to all objective observers
that a situation of reciprocal]{.underline} (if asymmetrical)
[deterrence existed between it and Israel]{.underline} --- and it
achieved that by having only relatively "dumb" weapons at its command.
Friedman was right to warn that with the much smarter surveillance and
guidance systems now presumably at its command, Hizbullah's ability to
project targeted threats against vital Israeli infrastructure is almost
certainly much, much higher.

Friedman's conclusion was that the demonstrations that Iran and its
allies (whether in Lebanon, Yemen, or elsewhere) have given in the past
few months of the high level of their targeting and command-and-control
capabilities have made the Middle East a considerably more dangerous
place:

> [\[T\]he Middle East may look calm right now, but that's an
> illusion]{.underline}. Everyone is recalculating: The Iranians are
> emboldened, the Arabs are frightened and Israel and Iran are one
> miscalculation away from a war of precision missiles that neither can
> afford.

[I **question this conclusion**]{.underline}, which seems unthinkingly
Israelocentric. After all, [[for]{.mark} **40 years** of
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} US-Soviet [[Cold War]{.mark}, the situation of
**reciprocal deterrence** and]{.underline} "Mutually Assured
Destruction" (**[[MAD]{.underline}]{.mark}**) between the world's two
largest, nuclear-armed superpowers [[gave]{.mark} a measure of
**[strategic calm]{.mark}**]{.underline} to a world still reeling from
the two globe-girdling wars of the first half of the 20th century.
(True, there were lots of nations in the Global South that suffered in
that era.)

But [why would we think that [in the Mid]{.mark}dle
[East]{.mark}]{.underline} of the second quintile of the 21st century, a
[situation of **[Mutual Intraregional Deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(MID) [[would be]{.underline}]{.mark} any more
de**[[stabilizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** than the Cold War's MAD was at
the global level?

[Indeed, [the]{.mark} actual [situation of **being deterred** that
**Israel**]{.mark}, **[Saudi]{.mark}**]{.underline} Arabia, **[[the

the **UAE**]{.underline} [have **[all evinced]{.mark}** in recent
months]{.underline} --- [at the hands of]{.underline} the
non-nuclear-weapons state [Iran]{.underline} and its allies in the
region --- [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} the most
**[[intriguing]{.underline}]{.mark}** aspect of the current situation.
Bearing in mind that two of those powers, Israel and the United States
are both well-endowed nuclear powers, what does this tell us about the
utility of nuclear weapons in today's world? A subject for another
day...

#### No Middle East war and no great power involvement

Ekaterina **Stepanova 16**, researcher at the Institute of World Economy
and International Relations, Summer 2016, "Russia in the Middle East:
Back to a "Grand Strategy" -- or Enforcing Multilateralism?,"

[[**In contrast** to]{.underline}]{.mark} the 20th century and [[the
early]{.mark} years of the [21st century, the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[regional [crisis in the 2010s]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[developed]{.underline}]{.mark} at a time [[when]{.underline}]{.mark},
overall, [[the **role and leverage of major powers** external to the
Middle East, as]{.underline}]{.mark} either [active [meddlers or
security guarantors]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region, or both,
actually [**[declined]{.mark} rather than increased**. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [serves as the most evident
case in point]{.underline}: the "post-interventionist" US administration
has clearly become "tired of the Middle East", struggling and often
failing to keep pace with the dynamically changing situation and unable
to alter or decisively affect the course of events. [The same even more
strongly applies to the European powers]{.underline}. In terms of
activity and impact, **[regional actors]{.underline}** (Iran, Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, UAE and Turkey) increasingly [appeared to outplay
external powers and influence]{.underline}.

For external powers, however, that did not remove a number of risks and
threats connected to, or emanating from, the Middle East. The increase
and diversification of global energy supply and the latest crisis in
energy prices made the region less central to the global economy than it
had been in the past. At the same time, the fundamental socio-political,
statehood and security crisis in the Middle East brought with it new
security concerns and implications. They mostly stemmed from reinforced
perceptions about the long-term nature of regional instability, the
continuing potential for further destabilization, and the related
consequences and implications beyond the region, ranging from terrorist
connections to migration flows. These challenges affect external powers
unevenly. For instance, the role of the Iraq-Syria area as the main
focal point for global terrorism activity and magnet for transnational
flows of violent extremists in the mid-2010s poses a threat to everyone
(but mostly to the countries of the region itself, as well as to those
in Europe and Eurasia). In contrast, the avalanche of refugee and
migrant flows from the Middle East primarily targets Europe (rather than
North America, Eurasia, or other regions).

Until recently, [[the main]{.underline}]{.mark} type of
[[response]{.mark} by key]{.underline} (Western) [external powers to
turbulent developments in the Middle East]{.underline}, while not
amounting to a hands-off approach, [[boils down to **limited
containment**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Examples range from limited air
strikes against "Islamic State" positions in Iraq and Syria, carried out
by the US-led coalition since 2014, to the 2013 deal on Syria's chemical
disarmament co-brokered by the United States and Russia. Not
surprisingly, this limited-containment approach has had equally limited
results for Syria, Iraq and the region -- as well as for the West itself
(as shown, e.g., by the persistent migrant flows and accelerating
terrorist attacks in Europe). [[Despite the]{.mark} growing [centrality
of the Middle East to global politics]{.mark} and security]{.underline},
and its more direct impact on and ties to the West, [[this **damage
limitation** course]{.mark} taken by key external actors [has not
been]{.mark} very [different from]{.mark}]{.underline}, e.g., [[the
approach]{.mark} taken [by the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and its Western allies (and also by
[[Russia and China]{.mark}) [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark} problem in recent years.

### No Turkey Aggression\-\--1NC

#### Interdependence and fears of backlash check Turkey aggression

At Large" column, senior fellow at the think-tank Friends of Europe,
"How rogue can Turkey go?," POLITICO, 1/1/20,
https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-rogue-state-recep-tayyip-erdogan/

[[There is no mechanism for expelling an errant]{.mark} NATO [member.
The alliance]{.mark} in the **past**]{.underline} [[turned a **blind
eye**]{.underline} [to military regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} [in Greece
and Turkey. [But diplomats say **pragmatic ways**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[would be found to work **around Ankara**]{.underline}]{.mark} if it
cannot be persuaded to mothball the Russian air defense system.

On the political front, [[the **EU** could]{.mark} in theory [pull the
plug on]{.mark} Turkey's [**accession** negotiations]{.mark}, which are
going nowhere]{.underline} given Erdoğan's assault on judicial
independence, media freedom and civil rights since he survived a failed
2016 military coup. But to do so would risk triggering another refugee
influx into Europe and do severe damage to an economic relationship
important for both sides. Germany would strongly oppose any such move.

[A]{.underline} more **[potent check]{.underline}** [on Turkish
disruption]{.underline}, at least in the short term, [could be
[Erdoğan]{.mark}'s **own ambitions**]{.underline}.

[The Turkish leader [needs]{.mark} to maintain a regular flow of
[**foreign investment** to steady the **economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and reassure the **urban middle class** that his first decade of
prosperity helped to swell]{.underline}.

[[His]{.mark} political [dream is]{.mark} to crown **[two decades of AKP
rule]{.mark}** by [refounding the]{.mark} Turkish [Republic as]{.mark}
the new [Atatürk]{.mark} on the 100th anniversary of its creation in
2023.]{.underline}

[[That gives]{.mark} Western officials [reason to hope]{.mark} that
[Erdoğan will **hold off escalating**]{.mark} **his [confrontations to
the point of crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For now, anyway.

### No Turkey Aggression\-\--No Entrapment

#### [Zero chance]{.underline} of entrapment\-\--NATO would simply [refuse]{.underline} aid

Michael **Moran 16**, Visiting Media Fellow and author of The Reckoning:
Debt, Democracy and the Future of American Power, "Turkey's Article 5
Argument Finds No Takers," Carnegie Corporation of New York, 2-24-2016,
https://www.carnegie.org/news/articles/turkeys-article-5-argument-finds-no-takers/

The ferocity of the [fighting between Syria's]{.underline} government
[forces and]{.underline} various proxies vying for control of territory
and resources has [Turkey]{.underline} on edge and [has already led
to]{.underline} several [deadly clashes involving]{.underline} the only
[NATO]{.underline} member state bordering the civil war.

[With Turkey, Russia, Iran, Iraq, and Gulf states pursuing their
own]{.underline}, often [conflicting aims in Syria]{.underline}, all
against the backdrop of a U.S.-led air and commando campaign against the
Islamic State (IS), [there is]{.underline} renewed [concern at NATO's
headquarters]{.underline} in Brussels [that Turkey could see the next
flare-up as grounds for citing Article 5]{.underline}: in effect,
demanding that its NATO allies deploy forces and come to its collective
defense.

[Turkey has already invoked]{.underline} the lesser-known [Article
4]{.underline}---a demand for an emergency consultation of the
alliance---following the downing of a Turkish warplane under disputed
circumstances last spring. Incidents like this and the threat that
Bashar Assad's forces might launch Scud missiles into Turkey led NATO
members---the United States, Germany, and Spain---to deploy Patriot
anti-aircraft missiles along the border in early 2013, though the German
and American batteries have since been withdrawn. Spain's---a less
capable version of the Patriot---is geared towards anti-aircraft, as
opposed to anti-ballistic missile defense, and therefore deemed more
appropriate

[But [could a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[new]{.underline}**
[incident]{.underline}]{.mark}---a missile strike, an IS incursion, or
Syrian artillery bombardment across the border---[[bring
the]{.underline} **[full might of NATO into the war?]{.underline}**
[Many are]{.underline} **[skeptical]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and
[for]{.underline} **[good reason]{.underline}**.

[[The **history of invocations of**]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO's
[**[Article 5]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[short]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} somewhat [[**underwhelming**.
In]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[68 years]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the
North Atlantic alliance's history, [[plenty of
**low-intensity**]{.underline} [conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}
[involving NATO]{.underline} nations [[have raged]{.mark}, from
rebellion in France's Algerian departments, to the U.S. war in Vietnam,
through the Balkan wars of the 1990s. [Yet]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[only
once]{.underline}** [has]{.underline} **[Article
5's]{.underline}**]{.mark} "all-for-one, one-for-all" **[[facility been
invoked]{.underline}]{.mark}**: that was **[September]{.underline}** 12,
**[2001]{.underline}**, the day after the al-Qaida attacks on the United
States.

[[Even **then**]{.mark}, its effect [was primarily]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[symbolic]{.underline}**]{.mark}. While the United States expressed
its deep appreciation at the time, NATO involvement in Afghanistan would
be minimal for years to come, though British, French, and a handful of
other elite forces arrived as early as November that year. In practice,
though, it was not until late 2003, when NATO assumed command of the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), that alliance troops
arrived in force, and even then often under restrictive rules of
engagement that limited their effectiveness.

Indeed, ISAF, the force NATO led from August 2003 to December 2013, was
a UN-sanctioned operation that included not only forces from NATO's 28
militaries but troops and specialists from 48 states, including such
disparate contributors as Mongolia, Tonga, and Singapore. At its height
in 2010--11, ISAF numbered more than 42,000 troops, augmenting 100,000
U.S. troops.

[[Turkey would]{.underline} **[sorely like]{.underline}** [a
commitment]{.underline}]{.mark} of that scale. [[Yet]{.mark}
the]{.underline} subtle **[[diplomatic realities]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[of the North Atlantic alliance---as well as the very unsubtle nature of
its own activity inside Syria---[make this]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[highly unlikely]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

For one thing, [[Turkey's]{.underline} **[own
military]{.underline}**]{.mark} has [[acted
aggressively]{.underline}]{.mark} in [targeting]{.underline} Syria's
[Kurdish rebels]{.underline}, the People's Protection Units, or YPG,
which Ankara views as little more than a proxy for the outlawed
separatist guerrillas of the Turkish Kurds, the Kurdistan Workers'
Party, or PKK. Last week, [the Turks [opened up on]{.mark} the
Kurdish-held air base at]{.underline} [**[Aleppo]{.mark}**, in spite of
the fact that the city]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
**[surrounded]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} forces loyal to
**[Assad]{.underline}**, the presumed enemy in Syria. [The
act]{.underline} **[[enraged]{.underline}]{.mark}** almost
**[[everyone]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Russia demanded at an emergency
Security Council meeting a censure of Turkey's violation of Syrian
sovereignty, and President Obama, who regards the Kurdish as the most
reliable ground force in the fight against the IS, urged Turkish
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in an 80-minute phone call on February 19
to avoid provocative actions.

[[While NATO has taken no]{.underline} **[official]{.underline}**
[position]{.underline}]{.mark} [on the question of Article 5---[**not
surprising**, since **no**]{.mark}]{.underline} formal
[**[request]{.underline}** [has been made---through]{.underline} **[back
channels]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the alliance [has
been]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[telegraphing]{.underline}**
[a]{.underline} **[resounding "no" to Turkey]{.underline}**]{.mark} for
weeks. Last week, [Luxembourg's Foreign Minister]{.underline} Jean
Asselborn [told]{.underline} Germany's [DerSpiegel that "NATO
**cannot**]{.underline} [allow itself to be pulled into a military
escalation with Russia as a result of the recent tensions between Russia
and Turkey]{.underline}."

Whatever the fate of the current U.S.-push to secure a cease fire,
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[large [NATO ground
force]{.mark}]{.underline}**, of the kind that deployed to Bosnia,
Kosovo, and Afghanistan, [[is **not** on the table]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### [Especially]{.underline} if war was [provoked by Turkey]{.underline}\-\--allies would prevent Turkey from [even invoking]{.underline} Article 5 by clarifying through [backchannels]{.underline} that illegal aggression does not require military support

Thomas O. **Falk 19**, studied law in London before obtaining his M.A.
in International Relations at the University of Birmingham, has been
working as part of an international team that provides the European
Commission and NATO with political news and developments, "Turkey and
NATO\'s (Non) Conundrum of Article 5," InsideOver, 10-20-2019,
https://www.insideover.com/war/turkey-and-natos-non-conundrum-of-article-5.html

[Turkey's invasion of northern Syria has been **met**]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} **[criticism]{.underline}** [amongst [European
leaders]{.mark}. Some of which have **openly
[floated]{.mark}**]{.underline} [the idea that
**[Erdogan]{.mark}**]{.underline} [could]{.underline} **[seek the
[support of NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** [if the conflict widened. It
which would make a large proportion of European states accessories of
Erdogan's move under NATO's Article 5 --]{.underline} **[only in
theory]{.underline}**, however.

**[Not unexpectedly]{.underline}**, EU foreign ministers were unable to
agree on a collective arms embargo against Turkey due to the invasion of
Syria at their meeting in Luxembourg. The necessary unanimity was not
achieved, several countries, especially Hungary, opposed the motion.

Instead, the EU states solely committed to "strong national positions
with regard to their arms exports to Turkey". Based on EU criteria that
the stability of the region should not be endangered. What it amounts to
is yet another display of a European Union divided on a message and
utterly powerless on the actual matter.

Whether or not an arms embargo could have had an actual impact or had
been political posturing in the first place, can certainly be debated.
What cannot be debated any longer is that Turkey continues to advance
its troops in Syria. Furthermore, while the ceasefire announced today
has only delayed the issue, it is hard to believe that Erdogan will
suddenly concede his grand strategy quest for a neo-Ottoman Empire.

As for the Europeans, Turkey's actions so far carry more than just
humanitarian connotation. [A potential **attack on Turkey** by the
**Syrian army** of allied actors in the conflict could lead to Turkey
**invoking NATO's Article 5**]{.underline} -- collective self-defence.
Under Article 5, an attack against a NATO member is considered an attack
against all, and so far, has only been utilised once in the Treaty's
history.

[Nevertheless, [invoking Article 5 does not]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[automatically]{.underline}** [warrant]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[unconditional [support]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the member states.
[Turkey [would have to invoke]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[Article
4]{.underline}** [first]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Under Article 4, any
member]{.underline} state [can]{.underline} **[convene]{.underline}** [a
meeting [with]{.mark} the [other members to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**["consult".]{.underline}**]{.mark} [Here, [Turkey
would]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[have to make a
case]{.underline}**]{.mark} [for why it feels that either its
independence or security is in jeopardy.]{.underline}

**[[Even in this scenario]{.mark},]{.underline}** however, [[chances
of]{.mark} Erdogan's [proceeding to]{.mark} the **next level (i.e.
[Article 5) seem inconceivable]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and
there are valid reasons for it.

First, [[the]{.underline} **[vast majority of
NATO]{.underline}**]{.mark} countries [have]{.underline}
**[already]{.underline}** [[called on Ankara to]{.underline} **[retreat
immediately]{.underline}**]{.mark} after the invasion began. [Besides,
[several]{.mark} NATO states]{.underline} timely [[pointed out
the]{.mark} possible [**dangers** of destabilisation]{.mark} of the
entire region]{.underline}. **[Germany, the Netherlands and
France]{.underline}** [have]{.underline} temporarily **[stopped selling
arms]{.underline}** to Turkey [in]{.underline}
**[protest]{.underline}**, with Merkel and French President Emmanuel
Macron condemning the Turkish invasion as an attack. Also, NATO
Secretary-General Jens **[Stoltenberg]{.underline}**
[stated]{.underline} last week [he expects Turkey to act with
restraint.]{.underline}

Second, [for Article 5 to be invoked,]{.underline}
[**[attack]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[defence]{.underline}**]{.mark} action [[need to be]{.underline}
**[distinguished cleanly]{.underline}**. **[All]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[NATO states [must]{.mark}, therefore, [regard]{.mark} the [military
actions of **Turkey**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Syria [[as]{.underline}
**[lawful]{.underline}**]{.mark} under international law -- [[which
is]{.underline}]{.mark} reasonably **[[unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark}**
also, particularly [after the remarks that have been made and the rules
laid out for self-defence under the Charta of the United Nations,
Chapter VII, Article 51.]{.underline}

[Considering these factors, [the necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[unanimity]{.underline}**]{.mark} [for collective self-defence
[appears]{.mark}]{.underline} to be **[[highly unlikely]{.mark} in
almost any scenario]{.underline}**. In fact, [due to the international
community's resentment towards Turkey, a **freeze of Turkey's NATO
membership**]{.underline} [seems more conceivable than other NATO
members taking Turkey's side on the battlefield.]{.underline}

DOD and the Department of State (DOS) have shared responsibility for
engaging with foreign partner militaries since the mid-twentieth
century, with the bulk of congressional security assistance funding
allocated to DOS. [**Any security [assistance]{.mark}** [*administered*

activity]{.underline}.21 After the terrorist attacks on September 11,
2001, the legal framework for the funding and administration of such
activities evolved in response to emerging threats. Congress
increasingly granted funding and authorities directly to DOD under Title
10 for security cooperation.22 Therefore, while DOS security assistance
programs can include DIB components, the majority of DIB-specific
programming is currently funded under and implemented by the Department
of Defense and is thus considered security cooperation.

[[Security cooperation is]{.underline}]{.mark} a compilation of
[financial, educational, and material [resources]{.mark},
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} at their foundation [[are supported by
the]{.mark} United States]{.underline}, in particular the
[[D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense]{.underline}, and are
used to support the peaceful development of democracies in foreign
countries. The [[resources provided by the Department of Defense]{.mark}
are available to foreign countries after the host nation]{.underline}
requests the peaceful assistance of the U.S. military in response to
systemic deficiencies in the bureaucratic management of a nation state
or when a nation state [recognizes that its military limitations prevent
it from properly defending its geographic borders]{.underline}. The host
nation's request for support from the U.S. is typically an effort by the
foreign country to develop its internal capacity to protect its people
and limit internal or external threats. The security cooperation
exercise Baltic Operation, held in Estonia, is an example of a foreign
country using the resources 9 provided by the United States to improve
its national defense capabilities in direct response to a perceived
threat to its sovereign borders. In this scenario Estonia is attempting
to develop its military capabilities and project an image of strength in
an effort to maintain the freedom it earned, from Russia, at the
conclusion of the Singing Revolution in 1992 and prevent a future
Russian incursion across its borders. [In contrast to this appropriate
use and definition of security cooperation]{.underline} as a strategy to
prevent conflict, the [Obama]{.underline} Administration [is using the
term security cooperation]{.underline} as a way [to]{.underline}
[define]{.underline} a national [exit]{.underline} strategy from a two
front war, a strategy that at its heart is based on the reconstruction
of a damaged infrastructure. [The false labeling of]{.underline}
reconstruction operations as [security cooperation is the foci of this

[Introduction to [Security Cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}

Introduction

[The term security cooperation [was]{.mark} first [introduced]{.mark} in
1997 [by the Defense Reform Initiative]{.mark}]{.underline} (DRI). At
that time, the then named Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA)
already had day to day management responsibilities of many security
assistance programs authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and
the Armed Export Control Act (AECA). The DRI proposed that DSAA also
manage certain Department of Defense (DoD) funded international programs
along with their personnel and associated resources. So that other U.S.
government (USG) agencies, the private sector and foreign governments
could better understand DSAA's enlarged mission and diverse functions
beyond security assistance (SA), DoD re-designated DSAA as the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) effective 1 October 1998.

In recent years, DSCA has absorbed management responsibilities for many
DoD international programs. In addition, DSCA leads the broader USG
security cooperation enterprise. However, many security cooperation
programs continue to be managed by other elements of the Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD), the combatant commands (CCMDs) or the
military departments (MILDEPs). What further complicated the management
of security cooperation was that the in-country point of contact between
the USG and the host nation generally is either the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA) sponsored defense attaché office (DAO) or the DSCA
sponsored security cooperation office (SCO). These two spigots for
security cooperation with a country required a broad knowledge and skill
baseline of the very different international programs that are
initiated, funded, and managed throughout the DoD and its agencies and
the MILDEPs. Most disconnects regarding SCO-DAO coordination of
in-country security cooperation were generally resolved with the
establishment of the Senior Defense Official-Defense Attaché (SDO/DATT)
having oversight over both the SCO and DAO organizations. It was not
until 9 June 2004 that [DoD published a [formal]{.mark}]{.underline},
yet still very broad, [[definition of security
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} in Joint Pub 1-02:

> [[All DoD interactions]{.mark} with foreign defense establishments [to
> build defense relationships]{.mark}]{.underline} that promote specific
> U.S. security interests, develop allied and friendly military
> capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and
> provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to a host
> nation.

[DODD 5132.03]{.underline}, DoD Policy and Responsibilities Relating to
Security Cooperation, 29 December 2016, [further defines security
cooperation with assigned responsibilities]{.underline}:

> [All DoD interactions with foreign defense establishments to build
> defense relationships]{.underline} that promote specific U.S. security
> interests, develop allied and partner nation military and security
> capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and
> provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to allied
> and partner nations. This includes DoD administered security
> assistance programs.

**The most [clear and specific]{.underline} definition conclusively
requires the DoD**

[Security cooperation has been a part of the U.S. Armed Forces for many
years]{.underline}. In fact, historians reveal that [the U.S. military
has always engaged in security cooperation with other countries and
their military forces]{.underline}. [However, [the term]{.mark} used to
designate such activities is now "[Security Cooperation]{.mark}," a term
that [has evolved]{.mark} conceptually]{.underline} through various
programs over the years. [During the 1990s, the terms "engagement" and
"shaping" were used without]{.underline} sufficient
[specificity]{.underline}; they were often used interchangeably,
[resulting in confusion]{.underline} that led to problems in both
planning and execution. [DOD thus adopted "Security Cooperation" in
2001. It included a broad range of military-to-military
activities]{.underline}, but it also clarified roles and
responsibilities. [The term Security [Cooperation]{.mark} thus
[describes]{.mark}]{.underline} a broad range of [[activities]{.mark}
used [by the D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f
[D]{.mark}efense]{.underline} in peacetime operations. These activities
refer to all DOD interactions that are [[carried out with foreign

Emerging technologies and the future of cyber security politics

Ever since cyber security issues have appeared on the agenda of national
and international politics, Jon R. Lindsay (2022) argues in his chapter
on the ambiguity of a cryptologic advantage, two analytically distinct
perspectives have informed the debate about their relevance for cyber
security politics. A first perspective builds on the premise that
technology determines politics. Anticipating the transformative
potential of emerging technologies, this view tends to extrapolate
dramatic consequence for security politics. We have already reviewed
early expert assumptions along the line that the nature of cyberspace is
destabilizing and favors the offense. A second perspective starts from
the opposite end of the relationship and assumes that politics
determines technology. Such an analytical perspective translates into
expectations that the sociopolitical context mitigates the supposed
advantages of cyber offense and reinforces established power
relationships (cf. Dunn Cavelty and Wenger 2019).

We argue throughout the volume that a perspective that combines the two
views and unpacks the co-constitution and co-dependency of technology
and politics provides a more productive analytical lens for studying the
ambiguous implications of rapid technological change on cyber security
politics and vice versa. Within this context, the chapters in this
volume discuss three key insights on the interrelationship between
emerging technologies and the future of cyber security politics. A first
subsection concentrates on tech race dynamics as drivers of cyber threat
perceptions. The focus here is on the interplay between global market
and geopolitical dynamics under multidimensional uncertainty and how
these dynamics feed into threat narratives. A second subsection
highlights that the sociopolitical context conditions the strategic
utility of emerging technologies. Here the focus is on how social and
institutional factors shape the influence that emerging technologies
have on the balance between the offense and the defense. A third
subsection deals with the growing role of private actors in digital
innovation in general and in securing cyberspace more specifically. The
focus here is on how the multiplication of actors increases the
socio-technical uncertainty and the sociopolitical ambiguity of the
governance space around emerging technologies.

Tech race dynamics as drives of cyber threat perceptions

The dynamic and emergent trajectory of technology development is a key
factor shaping the interplay between technology and politics.
Multidimensional uncertainty -- about the scope and tempo of the
technological development and about market dynamics and social
acceptance -- is a key driver of the innovation process (see Figure
16.1). Technology firms are exposed to market pressures and driven by
profit. They make their design and development decisions, including
complex trade-offs between the performance and the safety and
transparency of their products and services, in the shadow of a
potential first-mover advantage and the promise of huge economies of
scale. Conversely, governments influence the innovation process via the
formulation and implementation of technology strategies that specify
national levels of ambition. Such strategies aim at incentivizing the
domestic uptake of new technologies and creating a regulatory
environment that fits their societies' institutional and normative
contexts while positioning their countries in the best possible way in
the emerging global innovation space (Bonfanti 2022).

As new technological possibilities -- linked to the development of
artificial intelligence, quantum computing, or space technologies --
appear on the horizon, both governments and corporations focus on their
potentially transformative capacities, and, more specifically,
anticipate what role these technologies will play in shaping cyber
security. Most technologies discussed in the chapters of this volume are
dualuse technologies and as such might influence the global economic and
military balance. As a consequence, great powers tend to treat such
technologies as a potential strategic resource. Out of these technical,
economic, and (geo)political dynamics an ambiguous political interaction
dynamic evolves that fits the logic of the security dilemma (Jervis
1978): The means -- in this case maneuvring to attain or sustain an
advantage in critical technologies -- by which a state tries to maximize
its national interests and security threatens the interests and relative
security of other states.

From a political perspective, it is problematic if the technology
development process is dominated by only a few dominant economic (global
tech firms) and political actors (great powers). A concentration of
technical resources in the hands of a few actors might affect the global
distribution of economic and military power and create or deepen
asymmetric economic and political dependencies. A context of an
intensifying technology competition creates incentives for states to
influence the innovation process and the proliferation of new technology
in their narrow national interest (Fischer and Wenger 2019). Conversely,
technology race dynamics act as drivers of national threat perceptions
and tend to feed doom scenarios. State actors see themselves
increasingly caught in a global race for AI or quantum dominance
(Lindsay 2022; Bonfanti 2022). From the perspective of science and
technology studies, such threat narratives are co-constituted by the
micro-politics of design decisions in competitive global markets and the
macropolitics of great powers that act strategically in a competitive
international system (Fischer and Wenger 2021).

The strategic utility of emerging technologies depends on the
sociopolitical context

The insight that the balance between offense and defense in intelligence
has always depended more on institutional factors and strategic context
than on technological architecture represents the key message of Chapter
6 in this volume. Analyzing the tumultuous relationship between
cryptologic technology and political advantage, Jon R. Lindsay (2022)
highlights the fundamental political paradox between cryptography
(code-making) and cryptanalysis (code-breaking): They must cooperate to
compete and respect the constraints of a cooperatively produced
cryptosystem. As a consequence, cryptology turns into an organizational
contest and as such heavily depends on social factors. It does not come
as a surprise against this background that one of the central insights
of cryptologic history is that "gullible humans are the Achilles Heel of
classical cryptology" (Lindsay 2022: 89). This again, Lindsay argues,
makes it reasonable to expect that humans "will also be the undoing of
quantum cryptology" (Lindsay 2022: 89).

A working quantum computer should be able to crack the current
cryptographic protocols that are vital for cyber security. Anticipating
a one-sided technological breakthrough easily translates into fear that
a breakthrough in quantum computing might compromise the existing public
key infrastructure. As China began to heavily invest into quantum
technology, a threat narrative evolved in Western states that perceived
the great powers to be locked into a global race to gain a quantum
advantage. A quantum breakthrough would have major repercussion for
security and defense, so the arguments went, since one's own
intelligence would be locked out while the first-movers' communication
would become impenetrable. Should this indeed happen, policymakers and
strategists feared, global stability could be at risk.

Yet the implications of the interaction between technology and politics
will likely be more ambiguous, Lindsay argues. First, such a perspective
overlooks that the search for quantum safe protocols begins parallel to
the development of a quantum computer that would be able to break the
current cryptographic protocols. Second, quantum computing would not
change the reliance of cryptology on social factors. Intelligence
remains fundamentally a contest between human organizations. The current
golden age of cyber espionage was not enabled by a mathematically and
technically weak public key infrastructure. It can be traced back to an
overly complex organizational setup of the infrastructure and poor cyber
hygiene among computer users. Third, even if one side in a geopolitical
contest would develop a cryptographic advantage, how this advantage
would translate into a political outcome is not predetermined by
technology. Rather it would be contingent on the overarching strategic
context and the specifics of institutional decision-making. A
cryptanalytic success, Lindsay notes, can make a bargain more likely or
a surprise attack more attractive, and it may even provide a false sense
of security.

In his chapter, Matteo E. Bonfanti (2022) in a similar vein discusses
the implications of emerging AI technologies for the offense--defense
balance in cyber security. These implications are difficult to predict,
he argues, because the context is characterized by widespread
uncertainty and ambiguity. Most AI tools can be used in support of both
cyber defense as well as cyber offense. AI-based cyber capabilities will
affect both the logical (software) dimension as well as the semantic
(content) dimension of cyberspace. That AI will have major implications
for cyber security is undisputed among experts. Yet who will be the
winner -- offense or defense, states security agencies or private threat
intelligence firms, democracies or autocracies -- remains to be seen.
The eventual outcome of the integration of AI technologies into cyber
security depends on the strategic and sociopolitical context and the
risk-benefit calculations of many different public and private cyber
security stakeholder.

Strategic stability under multidimensional uncertainty

The assumed revolutionary potential of cyberspace, Miguel A. Gomez and
Christopher Whyte (2022) note in their chapter, was the product of the
twin uncertainties about the scope and tempo of the technical innovation
and the related social and political responses. As new technological
possibilities emerged, politics began to catch up in a process of
sociopolitical normalization. As a consequence, state behavior evolved
over time. In the absence of a demonstrable strategic utility of cyber
operations and a strategic context characterized by a puzzling
co-existence of restraint at the high end of conflict and persistent
low-level cyber conflict, key states started to increasingly move away
from deterrence to cyber conflict management. In 2018, the United States
issued a new cyber strategy signaling a shift to persistent engagement
and defend forward. The logic of the new approach emphasized that the
characteristics of the operational environment in cyberspace -- a space
of constant contact -- demand a continuing engagement and degradation of
adversarial cyber capabilities and operations wherever they were found
(US Cyber Command 2018; US Department of Defense 2019).

This shift away from deterrence might be premature and underestimate the
potential of (unintended) escalation, Gomez and Whyte argue. Moreover,
it is still unclear why states invest substantial technical, financial,
and organizational resources in using the domain offensively if cyber
operations are indeed of limited strategic utility only. Within this
context, the chapters in this volume focus on three interconnected
aspects of upholding strategic stability under multidimensional
uncertainty. A first subsection concentrates on the micro-dynamics of
decision-making that might drive escalation under uncertainty and
ambiguity. The focus here is on how prior beliefs and cognitive biases
might influence the response decisions of elite stakeholders in varying
national strategic cultures. A second subsection deals with the
ambiguities of attribution as a precondition for a credible deterrence
threat. The focus here is on how policymakers perceive cyberspace as a
completely human-built domain and how this translates into political
apprehension about the applicability of deterrence in cyberspace. A
third subsection analyzes the growing role of intelligence in
cyberspace. The focus here is on how the digitalization of intelligence
changed its strategic and operational role and what (un)intentional
consequences this had for cyber insecurity, on the one hand, and for
great powers' views on (un)acceptable behavior of intelligence services
in cyberspace, on the other.

Escalation: The micro-dynamics of decisionmaking in varying
sociopolitical contexts

Precisely because it is difficult to control the strategic effects of
cyber (influence) operations, more research is needed on the
micro-dynamics of decision-making that may drive unintended escalation.
Contributing to the behavioral turn in cyber security research, Miguel
A. Gomez and Christopher Whyte (2022) investigate the effects of
uncertainty on judgment in the context of (crisis) decision-making under
cyberattack. In such situations, the ambiguity of diffuse actors and
malicious actions increases the uncertainty of decision-makers about
both the intent behind and the consequences of cyber (influence)
operations. The authors use war gaming as a pseudo-experimental method
to determine if and how decision-makers use well-known heuristic
mechanisms such as prior beliefs and analogical reasoning to discern
intent and consequences behind cyber operations. The authors find
distinct evidence in support of the notion that decision-makers, when
faced with digital insecurity and the use of adversarial cyber
operations, fall back on noncyber situations to make their task simpler.

The degree to which heuristic shortcuts interfere with objectivity and
results in more or less severe responses depends on distinct national
(strategic) cultures. Gomez and Whyte discuss evidence of cross-national
cultural variations influencing the response decision among elite
stakeholders. The socio-institutional correlates of civil--military
relations in a given democracy stand out to have a unique impact on
decision-making processes. Based on their observations from
cross-national war games, they conclude that the interaction between the
microfoundations of decision-making in a given cultural and
institutional setting "might ultimately have some effect on the
strategic calculations states make around signaling and adversary
behavior" (Gomez and Whyte 2022: 125). The fact that unintended
escalation due to prior beliefs, cognitive biases of decision-makers,
and/ or bureaucratic politics cannot be excluded in strategic context
characterized by uncertainty and ambiguity highlights the advantage of
deterrence as a conflict management tool: As a theory of interdependent
decision-making, it might prevent militarization and escalation
(Schelling 1966).

Deterrence: The ambiguity of attribution in the context of cyber
conflict management

Over the years there has been considerable work invested at the
science-policy interface in adapting deterrence to the ambiguous context
of cyberspace. The scope of the practical applicability of the tenets of
deterrence to cyberspace is considerably more limited than in more
traditional conventional and nuclear deterrence settings (Soesanto and
Smeets 2020). At the same time, deterrence attempts in cybersecurity and
cyber defense span a wide spectrum of threats, including cybercrime,
cyber espionage, and operational cyberattack.

From a conceptual point of view, the attention at the lower end of
conflict shifted to criminological conceptions of deterrence and from
punishment to denial mechanisms converging on target hardening through
cyber resilience (Wenger and Wilner 2021). In such settings, though,
deterrence approaches are typically integrated with other coercive and
non-coercive tools into a broader conflict management strategy.
Conversely, at the higher end of conflict the attention of strategists
has shifted to the concept of cross domain deterrence (Lindsay and
Gartzke 2019). The focus here is on adversaries that apply ambiguous
"gray zone" strategies that integrate military and non-military coercive
instruments while evading attribution. Cross domain deterrence tends to
include both positive inducements and negative threats and brings the
concept of deterrence "back to the broader coercive diplomacy literature
from which it originally emerged" (Sweijs and Zilinick 2021: 152).

In his chapter on the limited reliance of Israel on cyber deterrence,
Amir Lupovici (2022) explores how new digital technologies enter into
doctrine and strategy. Acknowledging the methodological difficulties of
studying cyber deterrence, he deliberately shifts the focus from
studying what makes deterrence effective in a given strategic context to
analyzing how the cyber domain is embedded in Israel's strategic culture
and identity. From such a viewpoint, Lupovici argues, it is puzzling
that Israel has so far not developed a clear cyber deterrence strategy,
given the prominent role deterrence has played in Israel's strategy and
the country's "deterrer identity" (Lupovici 2016). Israeli policymakers,
he concludes, seem to recognize the uncertainty and ambiguity involved
in establishing a deterrence balance in cyberspace and consequently shy
away from formulating a declaratory cyber deterrence strategy.

From an operational point of view, Lupovici (2022) argues, Israel's
repeated use of offensive cyber operations against the Iranian and
Syrian nuclear programs have been interpreted by some experts as
attempts to establish cumulative deterrence through the actual use of
force, a concept which is deeply ingrained in Israeli strategic culture
(Adamski 2021). Yet the effectiveness of such a strategy remains in
dispute, Lupovici insists, and whatever deterrent threat might get
through to the adversary is communicated in an indirect and implicit way
only. From a conceptual perspective, the US strategy of persistent
engagement and defend forward seems to share some of the tenets of the
Israeli concept of cumulative deterrence (Tor 2015; Kello 2017). Yet the
concept of cumulative deterrence was customarily rejected by most US
strategists and policymakers, since in the context of nuclear deterrence
the use of force was seen as a symptom of deterrence failure,
signalizing a shift from a policy of influence to a policy of control
(Adamsky 2021).

It is quite telling that two of the leaders in thinking about and in
practicing deterrence in their different strategic contexts have come to
accept the limits of deterrence in cyberspace. The way US and Israeli
policymakers and strategist conceptualize the cyber domain -- as an
operating environment with a high degree of technical interconnectedness
(increasing uncertainty) and constant political contestation (increasing
ambiguity) -- seems to be part of the explanation why they,
respectively, moved away from cyber deterrence (United States) and never
declared a clear deterrence strategy (Israel). Although cyberspace is
conceptualized as the fifth domain of warfare, its structural
characteristics differ from the other four domains. Cyberspace is
completely human-built, shaped by technology companies, and operating in
it will always be hard and only partially under control of any one actor
(Seebeck 2019). Precisely because cyberspace is completely designed by
humans, states can shape it according to their interest. Yet as in
cryptology they must cooperate to compete and accept the constraint of a
cooperatively produced network of networks.

The economic and political logic of cyberspace as something completely
designed by humans might explain why states seem to perceive cyberspace
as a domain of intelligence rather than warfare. As discussed above, the
fact that setting up cyber exploitation is more expensive than
countering released exploitation translates into an incentive to keep
the target at risk. From a political point of view, transparent
attribution as a precondition of a credible deterrence threat is
difficult. Relating an intrusion set to a politically responsible party,
Kuerbis et al. (2022) argue, remains challenging because it includes a
judgment about the relation between victim and adversary. As such, it
should be interpreted as "a product more of political science or
intelligence studies than computer science" (Kuerbis et al. 2022: 222).

Paper published by the Center for Asymmetric Threat Studies, June 2016,

NATO members have declared cyber as an operational domain, just like
air, see and land. The decision reflects a notable adaptation in the
Alliance's 67-year history, and can be seen as part of a broader move to
adapt the alliance to changing warfare and security needs. In doing
this, NATO members have agreed to defend against attacks in cyberspace
just as they do against attacks launched against targets on other
warfare domains. NATO is adapting to its cumulative dependence on the
digital domain and responding to the increasing sophistication of cyber
capabilities developed by state and non-state actors. The cyber domain
is acknowledged to be an integral part of today´s modern wars, conflicts
and crises, and more specifically NATO´s current and future operative
security environment.

Cyber is becoming an inseparable part NATO's fundamental principle of
collective defense. The need for ambitious decisions in the Warsaw
Summit and beyond is driven forward by the accelerating threat and
increasing questions over resilience of networks upon which daily life
has come to depend. Incorporating cyber into other activities,
clarifying the cyber policy with regard to Article 5 and readiness to
conduct full-spectrum cyber operations with shared capabilities are not
just a wish for NATO - they are a necessity in today´s dynamic, complex
and uncertain world.

The declaration of cyber as a domain of warfare means that cyber-attacks
can more easily be used to justify invoking the collective defence
clause - article 5 - of the North Atlantic Treaty. The declaration also
reminds NATO member-states that collective cyber credibility begins with
countries´ own cyber defenses, which needs to be strengthened. Article 5
specifies "an armed attack" and NATO is officially ready to consider
cyber-attacks as an armed attack.

A preliminary step in this direction was taken at the Wales Summit two
years ago, when NATO declared that a "decision as to when a cyber-attack
would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North
Atlantic council on a case-by-case basis." The declaration clarified
that the invocation of Article 5 would be conditioned to each single
cyber-attack. However, any kind of cyber-attack against a state is a
type of aggression. The declaration opens the way for members to take
action against the aggressor, including the use of armed force, to
restore security.

One of the consequences of this new step is that the Alliance will have
to develop a comprehensive cyber doctrine as a separate entity, as well
as integrate it into overall planning and strategy documents. Though
easy on the surface, it will require NATO to address a number of
questions, while acknowledging that the most binary of domains (cyber)
is ultimately also one of the more political ones -- leading to the
concept of cyberpolitics. With the creation of cyberspace, a new arena
for the conduct of politics is taking shape, and we may well be
witnessing a new form of politics in NATO. The ubiquity, fluidity, and
anonymity of cyberspace have already challenged such concepts as
deterrence, national security and diplomacy in the traditionally
state-centric arena of international relations.

Whatever the shape of the doctrine, whether public or secret, when a
cyber-attack occurs in the future and NATO is involved, the doctrine
will have to provide reasonable guidelines when satisfactory answers are
sought to the following questions:

Who did it? Attributing cyber-attacks to their sponsor remains a
significant challenge, especially if attribution is to be public and
one-hundred percent certain. The trend is also towards governments
outsourcing cyber operations to non-state actors.

What were the consequences of the attack? The speed and covert nature of
cyber-attacks makes it difficult to readily establish their magnitude
and consequences; moreover, are secondary or tertiary effects to be
included in the estimate of consequences?

What are the instruments to respond? And, what is a proportional
response? Because cyber capabilities will continue to be primarily
national, it is possible that some member states could respond
symmetrically, while others must consider asymmetric responses. This is
a question of the levers of national power at a state's disposal and
willingness to use them. The judgement on proportionality is a political
judgement, as it will require a more flexible and historically context
aware judgement than a IF-THEN statement in code.

There's also a possibility that when a cyber-attack occurs a
member-state may overreact. Political prudence is needed, even though a
successful public cyber-attack that is attributed to specific actors
would likely create significant political pressure to respond. Restraint
should be encouraged, but based on the emerging "cyber warfare playbook"
this may be quite challenging.

What then might lead to cyber-attack causing Article 5 to be invoked? No
one knows, as it is situationally dependent. The old way of thinking is
that a 'severe cyber-attack' has to involve physical destruction --
people have to die and physical damage must be seen in the critical
infrastructure. However, as we become ever more dependent on data and
'non-kinetic assets', could for example the manipulation of health
records lead to Article 5 being invoked? Moreover, is there a difference
between banking data and health-care data being manipulated, with one
potentially leading to severe economic disruptions and the other in
extremis to death.

Formulating clear doctrines is frequently preferred by militaries, while
politicians and diplomats prefer flexibility in message and response.
The Alliance has two paths it can chose in creating the doctrine
regarding cyber. It can either chose a public approach, rather similar
to its approach when creating its most recent strategic concept. In such
a document it could generally describe what constitutes an attack that
would qualify for the invocation of Article 5, and what would be an
accepted retaliatory action. The other path is to maintain strategic
ambiguity, recognizing that formulating clear redlines would invite
potential adversaries to push up to the red line. In this case
developing the doctrine is still important, but would then be for
internal use only. This non-public approach may reduce the objective of
improving the Alliance´s cyber deterrence. The pace of development in
the field would argue against an overly specific set of guidelines or
doctrine, lest it require too frequent and politically challenging
updates.

The current 'cyber warfare playbook' is still a slim volume - but it is
growing by the day. In order to remain a credible defence alliance, NATO
must possess a credible cyber policy, including cyber deterrence.
Credibility comes from a largely similar set of actions as NATO has
engaged in regarding conventional military. Doing it in the cyber domain
is, however, harder at the moment. For example, what is the equivalent
of standing up in practice permanent battalions in member states? How do
you exercise, publicly message determination to defend and counter
aggression, in a serious but non-threatening way?

NATO has to find a clear way to deal with a 'Cyber Article 5' event. It
may be necessary to reinterpret what Article 5 and an armed attack
constitute in today´s world. The biggest challenges is to reach a shared
understanding of the limits (physical and cyber) which could lead a
member state to invoke Article 5 and delineate what proportionality in
response means. The decisions are political by their nature and requires
strong understanding on strategic cyber domain and its development by
the political actors involved. Ultimately, success will depend on how
the cyber is blended with traditional political and military power.

"Russia Prepares Destructive Cyberattacks," Foreign Policy, 3/30/22,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/30/russia-cyber-attacks-us-ukraine-biden/>

Russia is preparing disruptive cyberattacks that could target U.S.
energy and financial industries to cause further pain to the Biden
administration, in retaliation for heavy sanctions against the Kremlin
for its invasion of Ukraine, several people familiar with the matter
told Foreign Policy.

The FBI warned five U.S. energy companies in mid-March that computers
using Russian internet addresses had been scanning their networks, in a
possible prelude to bigger cyberattacks. Top U.S. cybersecurity
officials have warned that Russia is looking to conduct disruptive or
destructive digital attacks, as opposed to conducting routine espionage.

The Russian handiwork could provide a means for poking the United States
and other NATO countries for their support of Ukraine without provoking
a wider conflict. Unlike the tit-for-tat ladder of escalation that U.S.
military doctrine applies to a possible nuclear conflict with Russia or
China, American officials over the last three administrations have
struggled to draw clear rules of the road for cyberattacks. Jen
Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency, said last week that every U.S. sector is likely vulnerable to
digital strikes.

Russia, which seems to have little defense for American- and
European-delivered anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles on the Ukrainian
battlefield, doesn't have to hit the biggest American target to have an
impact, experts said, but can bloody the nose of U.S. companies in
digital attacks that fall below the threshold of demanding a response
from President Joe Biden and his team.

"The goal is to inflict pain in a way that they can walk back from,"
said Nick Biasini, the head of outreach at Cisco Talos, the
cybersecurity company's threat intelligence arm. "They're going to be
going after where they can inflict damage, where they can actually cause
pain."

Dave Lewis, a Cisco global advisory chief information security officer,
took it one step further. "Back in the early days of the internet, the
attackers would try to get their defacement up and that was their whole
modus operandi," he said. "Now it's just a matter of whose IP
\[address\] is coming up next. They're going to cast a wide net and see
what they can hit."

Most companies have been preparing for a range of scenarios for years
that Russia could roll out, including denial of service attacks to shut
down networks by flooding them with traffic, defacement of government
and corporate websites, or ransomware attacks that seize and lock down
servers until their operators cough up cash, like the 2021 attack that
knocked out the Colonial pipeline in the southeastern United States for
nearly a week.

But experts believe that Russia doesn't have to use digital attacks that
harm physical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere to cause
problems. Biasini said that Russia had learned from the Colonial
pipeline attack that it could cause chaos by simply hacking into the
enterprise software that underlies energy companies, instead of taking
more destructive and sophisticated cyberattacks that render equipment
inoperable.

There are also public signals that Russian hackers could put U.S. energy
companies in the crosshairs. The U.S. warnings come as pro-Kremlin
propaganda channels and news outlets have ridiculed the Biden
administration's assertion that Russian President Vladimir Putin is
responsible for higher global gas prices because of the wider invasion
of Ukraine.

Both the United States and the United Kingdom have barred imports of
Russian oil and natural gas, and major European states such as
Germany---which already shelved the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project over
the invasion---have promised to begin the arduous process of weaning
themselves off of Russian energy, which accounts for more than 40
percent of European gas imports.

"It's kind of paradoxical," said Gavin Wilde, a nonresident fellow at
Defense Priorities and an expert on Russia and information warfare who
previously served as a director for Russia, Baltic, and Caucasus affairs
on the U.S. National Security Council. "The more isolated Russia is on
the global stage, the fewer constraints it may feel to act in
cyberspace."

Experts said that the higher energy prices go, the more difficult it
could become for the United States to keep antsy European capitals in
line with crushing sanctions on the Russians. "Now, I think, would be a
good time from the Russian standpoint to do it, given that they're sort
of getting into a standstill on the ground in Ukraine," said Dmitri
Alperovitch, a cybersecurity expert at the Silverado Policy Accelerator.
"They can refocus their attention on the West and try to divide the
Europeans from the U.S. on these sanctions moves."

But even though American energy and financial companies have been
girding themselves for a range of possible Russian cyberscenarios, the
Kremlin's well-honed capability and determination to render U.S.
networks inoperable could make it a formidable adversary, even for the
best-defended firms. "If the Russians focus their efforts on a target
and they want to compromise that target and destroy it, they'll be able
to do so," Alperovitch said.

These aren't garden-variety smash-and-grab cybercrime attacks that U.S.
officials and experts are expecting from Russia this time. Russia tends
to blur the line between criminal gangs and government-backed hackers,
experts said, making it difficult to determine exactly what the Kremlin
will order. "You're dealing with an adversary that's in a very difficult
mindset and one that's shifting all the time," said Biasini, the Cisco
expert. "So it's something that may be on the table today \[but\] might
be off the table tomorrow and vice versa." In the past, Russia has also
drawn on privateers and activists motivated by financial gains.

Domestically, the Russian government has been systematically tightening
its grip on its own cybersphere, too---especially over the past few
years---in pursuit of a grand strategy to cement into law the Kremlin's
total control over the internet. Since 2019, when Putin introduced a set
of amendments granting the Kremlin the power to interfere with the
dissemination of information online, Russians have been engaging with an
increasingly engineered, censored internet. A flurry of laws passed
since then have only put more pressure on tech companies to comply or
face fines and other kinds of punishment.

For example, the Russian government throttled---intentionally slowed
down---Twitter when the social media company refused to remove posts
showing minors at protests during a surge in support for Alexei Navalny,
the imprisoned Russian opposition leader, when he experienced a sharp
deterioration in health in March 2021. The Kremlin had labeled sensitive
content involving minors and sensitive issues, such as drug abuse and
suicide, as prohibited, using it as leverage to cover up the scope of
dissent, explained Grant Baker, a technology and democracy researcher at
the U.S.-based nonprofit Freedom House.

During the monthlong war in Ukraine, Russian hackers have mostly tried
to grab as many footholds as they can in Ukrainian networks to steal
information, gain remote access, and use malicious so-called wiper
software to destroy valuable files, Lewis and Biasini, the Cisco
experts, told Foreign Policy. Biasini said Cisco and other U.S.
companies are working with Ukraine to kill significant numbers of remote
access Trojans that are used to gain remote control of computer systems.

But just as U.S. officials believe that Russian troops have run into
stiffer-than-expected resistance from Ukrainian troops on the physical
battlefield, Kyiv has also proved more resilient in cyberspace than the
Kremlin anticipated, U.S. officials and experts said. Speaking during a
Senate hearing on Tuesday, Gen. Tod Wolters, the head of U.S. European
Command and NATO's supreme allied commander, told lawmakers that
Ukraine's command of its military forces remained in place, while Russia
is facing difficulties getting military orders to its units due to
problems with its communications equipment, as well as disciplinary
infractions in the ranks. Wolters added that he believed the United
States and NATO had "dramatically" improved their offensive and
defensive cybertactics and ability to control the information
environment over the course of the Ukraine conflict.

"The internet's a live-fire environment," said Lewis, the Cisco
cybersecurity expert. "They're just one more adversary in an absolute
rogue's gallery that is out there."

and Journalism Student at UNC Chapel Hill, "Cyberattacks Can Invoke NATO
Defence Clause," The Organization for World Peace, 4/25/22,
<https://theowp.org/cyberattacks-can-invoke-nato-defence-clause/>

The ability to communicate in real-time with friends, family, and random
internet strangers thousands of miles away falls nothing short of
spectacular. Every rose has its thorn, and every computer system can be
a victim of a cyberattack. In a world ever-connected, "Everything is
reliant in some form on digital capabilities," said Michael Daniel, CEO
of the Cyber Threat Alliance and a former cybersecurity official during
the Obama administration. This means there are many "different avenues
to create disruptions... for the West."

Amidst the war in Ukraine, concerns over cyberattacks across the globe
threaten the security of countries and alliances. A cyberattack on any
NATO member state would trigger Article 5, the collective defense
clause, which says that an act of war against any member will trigger a
response from the full alliance. No lines have been marked as to where
cyberaggression falls in the spectrum of "acts of war," but a NATO
official said last week that the allies might consider significant
malicious cumulative cyber activities as an armed attack.

United States Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner posed a
hypothetical case in which they and other NATO allies would have to
retaliate against Russian cyber warfare. If a Russian cyberattack on
Ukraine impacts Poland, a NATO member, and the attack triggers power
outages that result in hospital patients dying or knocking out traffic
lights that cause fatal road accidents involving U.S. troops, then NATO
would have to intervene.

Most officials agree that the chances of a Russian cyberattack, either
directly or indirectly against the U.S., are very low due to the
exponentially escalating nature of doing so. The U.S. and Western Europe
have already taken severe unprecedented financial measures against
Russia by cutting the country off from roughly \$600 billion in reserves
held by the Central Bank of Russia, according to a Reuters article. NATO
members also banned Russian state banks from using a bank messaging
system to conduct international transactions. Despite all of the
sanctions and financial misery the U.S. and Europe have imposed on
Russia, Vladimir Putin has demonstrated cyber restraint.

The question is not whether Russia can "Carry out cyberattacks against
Europe or the United States," said Melissa Griffith, a senior science
and technology innovation program associate at The Wilson Center. Rather
it is what Russia would gain and risk "By carrying out cyberattacks
against the United States and Europe."

Warner thinks that is soon to change. "I think we will probably see that
in the coming days and weeks as Putin tries to lash out against the
crippling level of sanctions we've put on him," Warner said.

He is not alone in his fears. Last week, the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) updated the "Shields Up" guidance
to urge businesses and organizations to prioritize their cybersecurity.

"While there are no specific or credible cyber threats to the U.S.
homeland at this time, Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which has
involved cyber-attacks on the Ukrainian government and critical
infrastructure organizations, may impact organizations both within and
beyond the region, particularly in the wake of sanctions imposed by the
United States and our Allies," the CISA guidance states. "Every
organization --- large and small --- must be prepared to respond to
disruptive cyber activity."

Daniel, the CEO of the Cyber Threat Alliance, expects retaliation to
come in the form of cyberspace. Daniel posited that many people "In the
industry expect that some form of retaliation will come through
cyberspace because it's an area where the Russians have a lot of
capability, and it's one where the West has a lot of vulnerabilities."
What has been the greatest accomplishment of the 21st century is now the
biggest weak spot in the West, as the U.S. and Western Europe are
digitally dependent societies where life is unimaginable without the
internet.

However, our social media accounts and school emails aren't likely
targets for Russian cyberattacks. Cyber experts expect the oil and gas
industries are the most vulnerable because they are not mandated by law
to invest in cybersecurity. Meanwhile, President Biden has urged
critical infrastructure in the financial, energy, and health care
sectors to strengthen their cyber defenses.

Western European countries are the likely targets of Russian
cyberattacks. James Lewis, a senior vice president and program director
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the U.K,
France, and the Baltic states must remain vigilant in their cyber
defense. He predicts Russia will save its ammunition for France until
the presidential election is held in mid-April in order to interfere
with the process.

If France or any other NATO country falls victim to Russian
cyberattacks, there is no guarantee yet on whether article five will
really be invoked. "We will not speculate on how serious a cyberattack
would have to be in order to trigger a collective response," said the
NATO official. "Any response could include diplomatic and economic
sanctions, cyber measures, or even conventional forces, depending on the
nature of the attack." There are no clear guidelines on how NATO would
respond if called to defend a member country from a cyberattack, said
Warner.

No one knows if or when a cyberattack from Russia is on the timeline,
but Lewis said that "Cyberattack is now part of everybody's military
planning."

Katrina **Manson 22**, reporter at Bloomberg Business covering cyber and
emerging tech, "Nobody Knows Where the Red Line Is for Cyberwarfare,"
Bloomberg, 5/2/22,

A common explanation for why the Soviet Union never used nuclear weapons
during the Cold War was the expectation that any attack would likely
prompt a devastating nuclear response. The fear of mutually assured
destruction was enough to keep both the USSR and the U.S. from launching
a nuclear attack, even as they spent decades building up huge stockpiles
of weapons.

Cyberweapons are different. Cyberattacks by both governments and private
hackers have exploded in recent years. Many of these are financially
motivated, but others involve espionage or, in several high-profile
cases, the sabotage of physical infrastructure. There's broad agreement
that at some point a cyberattack would be considered an act of war. Yet
no one knows quite where the line is.

\[TABLE OMITTED\]

The situation is more dangerous than ever. Russia's bloody invasion of
Ukraine raises the specter of cyberattacks starting an escalatory spiral
that results in an all-out war with the U.S. The Biden administration
has already warned Russian President Vladimir Putin against targeting 16
sectors at the heart of U.S. economic and national security, including
energy and finance. "We will respond with cyber," Joe Biden told
reporters last summer after meeting Putin face to face in Geneva. The
president didn't lay out exactly what that would entail but added,
darkly, "he knows."

On May 4-5, cyber experts from the Biden administration, the military,
and academia are gathering at Vanderbilt University to discuss the new
contours of modern conflict at an event organized by Brett Goldstein, a
former senior Pentagon official and computer scientist who's now special
adviser to Vanderbilt's chancellor. Goldstein says that in the next 5 to
10 years the U.S. should develop a strategy of cyber mutually assured
destruction---or cyberMAD---as a form of deterrence. "It is essential
that we take lessons from the success of nuclear MAD concepts," he says,
warning that U.S. vulnerabilities are only going to grow.

The Department of Defense is preparing a new cyber strategy this year
that's likely to include a more prominent role for deterrence. U.S.
officials and policy experts have been debating whether it's better to
dissuade attacks with the promise of retaliation in cyberspace or
elsewhere, or to try to prevent them by taking offensive cyber measures
that cut off rivals' ability to carry them out. The Biden
administration's strategy will be based on integrated deterrence---the
concept that attacks can be prevented by threats of economic penalties
or other responses that rely on various levers of U.S. power.

Lawmakers from both parties and experts from outside government are
pushing for their own vision of deterrence. A two-year, congressionally
mandated bipartisan effort that concluded last year, the Cyberspace
Solarium Commission, favors a variation of the theme "layered cyber
deterrence," which combines a focus on hardening technical defenses
against attacks with the promotion of international norms against, say,
cyberattacks targeting civilian infrastructure.

Goldstein's faith that the threat of catastrophic response could prevent
state-sponsored cyberattacks makes him an outlier. Deciding when to
respond would be fraught, because determining who has carried out any
breach can be tricky. The best hackers often mask their identities.
Russian hackers, for instance, have left bread crumbs suggesting they're
North Korean or Iranian, cybersecurity experts have said. Officials say
they've become better in recent years at determining responsibility for
attacks.

Unlike nuclear weapons, which haven't been used since World War II, the
tools of cyberwarfare are widely available and used regularly for
attacks of varying seriousness. "Redlines are notoriously difficult to
define in cyberspace," Emily Goldman, a cyber strategist at U.S. Cyber
Command, wrote in a 2022 paper for the journal The Cyber Defense Review.
She argued that sanctions, criminal indictments, and other deterrent
measures have proven ineffective: "More of the same will not produce
different results."

General Paul Nakasone, the leader of the U.S.'s 6,000-person military
Cyber Command and one of the speakers at Goldstein's event, has
dismissed the nuclear parallels. "Cyber deterrence is not nuclear
deterrence," he told Congress in April. For the past several years he's
overseen an increase in the Pentagon's continuous offensive cyber
operations outside U.S. borders, under a strategy he's described as
"defending forward."

The U.S. began changing its approach when Russian interference in the
2016 presidential election led U.S. leaders to overcome their reluctance
for counteroffensive cyberattacks, according to Jonathan Reiber, who
authored the government's 2015 cyber strategy when he was the chief
strategy officer for cyber policy at the Department of Defense. In 2018,
Congress changed the legal definition of offensive cyber operations,
classifying them as traditional military activity. That same year the
Trump administration issued a classified policy memo that some U.S.
lawmakers said essentially delegated authority to the Defense Department
to conduct them without the White House signing off.

Nakasone told Congress that both the legal change and the policy memo
have been "very helpful." The Biden administration is reviewing the
memo, and proponents of the "defend forward" strategy worry it could
decide to restrict Cyber Command's ability to act effectively.

One problem with using the threat of cyberattacks as a deterrent is that
cyber superiority is inherently ephemeral, according to Nakasone. While
a nuclear arsenal's power is persistent, cyberweapons rely on exploiting
vulnerabilities in code, which can be patched and disappear as quickly
as they're found. So, unlike nuclear weapons, Nakasone's cyber arsenal
and access routes must change all the time. The U.S.'s ability to find
and exploit such vulnerabilities is significant, but its ability to
carry out attacks on specific targets may ebb and flow.

Some academics argue that "defending forward" is a euphemism for the
U.S. waging its own attacks. In a paper for the Atlantic Council in
March, cyber coercion expert Jenny Jun argued that the strategy leaves
"much room for misjudgment and misinterpretation" about how the U.S.
will respond and that instead of being a deterrent, it could encourage
adversaries to strike first rather than wait to be compromised
themselves.

Amid such uncertainty over the nature of cyberwar, Erica Lonergan, a
senior director on the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, says that debates
over deterrence have become unhelpfully "binary." The best way to
prevent major cyberattacks may not be to threaten or execute cyber
operations, she says, but to rely on other instruments of national
power. In 2018 the Trump administration listed using nuclear weapons as
a potentially appropriate response to a non-nuclear strategic attack, a
category that could include a catastrophic cyberattack. The Biden
administration reserves the right to choose how it responds, including
with military force, and insists a cyberattack against any NATO ally
could trigger a joint response from all 30 countries.

One challenge is that the lack of a clear definition of cyberwarfare has
tempted countries to test the limits, carrying out smaller attacks under
the assumption they won't be enough to provoke a major response. Some
experts warn that the U.S.'s ability to establish norms surrounding such
attacks has been undermined by its own history of cyberattacks, digital
spying programs that targeted civilians---including allied leaders---and
the Stuxnet attack that targeted Iran's nuclear facilities more than a
decade ago, a campaign widely believed to have been carried out by the
U.S. and Israel.

Michael Daniel, a former cybersecurity coordinator under the Obama
administration, says the U.S. could do a lot more to deter the
proliferation of cyberattacks that fall below the threshold of war in
cyberspace. "The question is, can you use the government's national
power to reduce the volume of malicious activity in cyberspace and
reduce its impact on the United States?" he says.

A small, and potentially temporary, comfort is that Russia's war with
Ukraine has so far resulted in less cyberwarfare than many experts
expected. One theory as to why, put forth by Lennart Maschmeyer, a
cybersecurity researcher at ETH Zurich, is that they aren't as effective
as many people believe. He's studied the impact of Russian cyberattacks
against Ukraine since 2014. "They have really achieved almost no
measurable strategic impact," he says. Another explanation could be that
Russia didn't plan any, because it anticipated swift military victory.
That could change as the war grinds on, and recent research from
Microsoft indicates Russia has been using "destructive and relentless"
cyberattacks against Ukrainian services and institutions.

It's also possible deterrence is working and Russia has been fearful of
carrying out cyberattacks outside of Ukraine because that could trigger
NATO's Article 5, the collective defense clause, and draw other nations
into the conflict. For Goldstein, this hesitance points to a strategic
opportunity. "We may be seeing the early bones of what deterrence could
look like," he says.
