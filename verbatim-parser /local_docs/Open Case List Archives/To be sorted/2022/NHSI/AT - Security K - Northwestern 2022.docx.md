#### Researching the [methods]{.underline} and [culture]{.underline} of hybrid war is [important]{.underline}\-\--rejecting "hybrid war" exacerbates the danger it poses.

With great (power) wars past long ago and today's decline of inter-state
conflicts worldwide, with Pax Americana and Pax Europaea largely
enduring since the end of the WWII (thus, democratizing nations and
relations among them)1 , a Fukuyama-styled decisive victory of a liberal
democratic order willy-nilly crosses one's mind. And yet, the
1989-declared 'end of the history' has to be postponed -- again:

'There is a feeling abroad today that Western civilization is on trial
before history. One of the clearest signs of it is the increasing
frequency with which we hear the word "challenge" in connection with the
policies and progress of Soviet \[Putin's\] Russia and the Communist
\[illiberal\] world at large' (Tucker 1959: 1) (edits to the original
mine. -- AT).

It sufficed two tiny edits (updates -- if you wish) in the afore-quoted
statement to render the strategic world-political assessment of the
1960s-peaking Cold War, made by a renowned American Sovietologist at
Harvard and Princeton Universities, its full-sound quality and resonance
in the realities of our-age and twenty-second century global politics

Indeed, just a decade ago, as Russia's military campaign in Georgia was
unfolding, the near and far neighbourhood's discourses were intensively
echoing questions such as: 'Is Ukraine next?' Some half a decade ago, as
Russia's less conventional military aggression and political subversion
campaign in Ukraine erupted, questions did resonate in the region and
far beyond: 'Are the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia
next'2 ? Couple of years ago, as Russia's covert military and political
overtures in Syria and Libya, US and the UK, Germany, France, Poland,
the Netherlands and so forth unraveled, the answers to the question
'who's next?' seem to have been tacitly found -- at least no more
geographical directions are being pointed to. The paradox discovered
here lies in the simplicity that was self-delusively denied being
accepted in many European capitals: the genuine realist answer to the
'what/where/ who next?' question has always been 'where necessary -- to
defend national interests' (however defined). [Waging a **hybrid
war**]{.underline}(fare) [has become one of the proven ways to defend
Russia's interests]{.underline} in near and far neighbourhoods. Rather
disturbingly, [it is]{.underline} incrementally becoming [a preferred
way to advance interests of other state and non-state actors. The spread
of the **hybrid warfare methods** and the **culture of hybrid
war**]{.underline} as such [is a **new reality** to which the
policymakers and scholarly communities alike need to **wake
up.**]{.underline}

[A number of]{.underline} analytical [works]{.underline} written so far
[have been dedicated to disentangling]{.underline} the [hybrid warfare's
**nature** and **manifestations**]{.underline}, i.e. the art of war. [It
is of **little use** if]{.underline} it is [not accompanied
with]{.underline} the [analysis of '**whose war**?']{.underline} problem
[in the sense of seeking response to the]{.underline} fundamental
[questions **who** is **waging the war** (**aggressor**), to **what
end** (]{.underline}broad [**strategic** and **tactical aims**), against
**whom** (**war targets** and **theatres**) and who will stand in
**defence**]{.underline} (national and/or **[collective
defence]{.underline}** and deterrence)? The vast majority of these
[questions is left **unanswered**]{.underline} in much of the scholarly
and policy writings. [Ambiguity and]{.underline} deliberate
[straight-talk avoidance abound. Ambiguity is the]{.underline} best
[**bedfellow** of **hybrid war**]{.underline}(fare). Thus, [as long as
there is]{.underline} a lack/[**avoidance** of **clarity** in
**scholarly**]{.underline} and political [**answers** to the
**aforementioned questions**, the **international constellations** will
remain **thriving** for a **spatial** and **temporal** **contagion of
hybrid war**(fare).]{.underline}

This article seeks to problematize the contagion of hybrid war and
hybrid warfare -- both with the zoom on Russia and in a much wider
world-political perspective: geographic, temporal and agential.

[With no pretense to]{.underline} pathetic or [**inflated claims**, this
article casts a **broad**]{.underline} analytical [**perspective** on
the **creeping hybridization** of war and order and posits]{.underline}
that [the phenomenon is **there** to **stay** unless]{.underline}
strategically **[contained]{.underline}** and devaluated as a
proliferating means of twenty-first century politics. Thereby, [it
invites **thinking beyond** '**the Ukraine crisis'**]{.underline} [and
**'the Russia challenge'**]{.underline} in (Eastern) Europe -- i.e. a
well-founded, though, admittedly, a way too narrow (both spatially and
temporally, as well as in terms of agency and warfare modalities)
hyper-focus in much of the political and academic debate today.
[The]{.underline} currently [observed **expansion** of Russia's theatres
of hybrid war]{.underline}(fare) [from **Ukraine** to **Middle East**,
**Europe** and the **US**, as well as]{.underline} the tactical variance
and [constant **innovation** of warfighting]{.underline} methods, as
practiced and mutually observed/emulated by agents beyond Russia (such
as Iran, China, or the ISIS), [points to the pertinence of]{.underline}
broader [emerging trends that **concern** the foundations of
**international theory**, **strategic** and **military
studies**]{.underline} -- rather than policy or area studies alone. [The
**contagion**]{.underline} [effects of **hybrid war**]{.underline}(fare)
[**discursive** and **political practices**]{.underline} across the
globe [is what shapes the]{.underline} core [analytical
puzzle]{.underline} of the current article. Focusing on [the
**ontologies** of the **hybrid war** and **warfare
contagion**]{.underline}, as evidenced in proliferating ideologies and
politics of hybrid war(fare) as well as richly documented in policy
analyses and scholarly literature, this article [problematizes the
**agency**]{.underline} (action-reaction) **[dilemmas]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} both [states and societies]{.underline} directly
[targeted by]{.underline} such [hostile campaigns]{.underline} as well
as the international (liberal democratic) community at large.

NATO

"[Hybrid warfare]{.underline}" has [emerged as]{.underline} yet [another
"**resilience test**"]{.underline} (Stoltenberg 2015a) [for the Alliance
in its]{.underline} post-Cold War [existential search for a **new
purpose**]{.underline} and mission. Moreover, the **[hybrid
insecurity]{.underline}** predicament [enables]{.underline} the [allies
to bring together]{.underline} the [renewed focus on NATO's
**traditional** mission (i.e.]{.underline} endorsing **[collective
defence]{.underline}** in order to counter the main geopolitical
contestant of the North Atlantic Alliance in Europe[) and]{.underline}
the Alliance's post-Cold War [out-of-area]{.underline} military
[expeditions]{.underline}. While "tak\[ing\] on two different forms of
strategic challenges simultaneously" -- that is, "the Russian [hybrid
warfare]{.underline} approach" and that of "other non-state actors like
ISIS to the south" -- [remains NATO's "**greatest
challenge**"]{.underline}, the common idea behind these "hybrid
strategies" endorses the relevance of "a comprehensive approach across
the DIMEFIL spectrum" (i.e. diplomatic/political, information, military,
economic, financial, intelligence, legal) for NATO (Breedlove 2015, p.
xxv; cf. Bell 2012, pp. 225--226). The "beauty of the hybrid warfare
concept" is accordingly seen to lie in its ability to "provide tools for
a comparative strategic perspective of NATO's southern and eastern
flanks, while allowing for a differentiated response" (Johnson 2015, p.
276). [NATO's motto]{.underline} in the face of these twofold challenges
[is called to be "adopt, adapt, adept": the]{.underline} new
[strategies]{.underline} adopted [to deal with]{.underline} the [hybrid
threats]{.underline} to NATO's East and South [need to be accompanied by
NATO's adaptation of "its structure]{.underline} and readiness [to
become adept at handling]{.underline} the [new challenges]{.underline}
it faces" (Calha 2015, p. 9).

[Countering hybrid threats]{.underline} posed by Russia and the Islamic
radicals [threatening]{.underline} the territories, populations,
interests, and values of [the Alliance]{.underline} thus [enables NATO
to endorse its]{.underline} continuing [relevance by constructing a
**strong narrative** and maintaining]{.underline} its [**OS** as the
core security guarantor for its **members**]{.underline} (cf. Flockhart
2012, pp. 78--79). [The softer, partnershipgeared]{.underline}, or
so-called "Jane" [narrative of]{.underline} the early-[post Cold War
NATO is]{.underline} clearly [giving way to a more familiar, **hard
security-focused** "Tarzan" self-vision and public
representation]{.underline} (see further Flockhart 2011). Calling the
kettle black is the least of NATO's worries: [Russia's use of "proxy
soldiers, unmarked Special Forces, intimidation and propaganda, all to
lay a thick fog of confusion; to obscure its]{.underline} true [purpose
in Ukraine; and to attempt deniability" is]{.underline} explicitly
[dissected in outlining NATO's emerging counter-strategy to hybrid
engagements]{.underline} of the sort (Stoltenberg 2015a). Yet, just the
traditional set of [NATO's capabilities is]{.underline} clearly
[deemed]{.underline} to be [insufficient in the face of]{.underline},
inter alia, "[sophisticated disinformation]{.underline} and
radicalization [campaigns]{.underline}" (Stoltenberg 2015b),
[this]{.underline} more forceful and traditional [antagonist-driven
agenda reflects NATO's]{.underline} long-pursued comprehensive approach
-- that is, "a [combination of military and non-military means to
stabilize countries]{.underline}" (that others use to "destabilize")
(Stoltenberg 2015a). "[Hybrid]{.underline}" [is]{.underline} accordingly
coined as "[the **dark reflection**]{.underline}" [of NATO's
comprehensive approach, and]{.underline} accordingly, early warning and
situation awareness, [good governance and]{.underline} the
[resilience]{.underline} of societies [become]{.underline} equally
[essential parts of **deterrence** and **defence** against **hybrid
threats**]{.underline} (Stoltenberg 2015a). This necessitates "renewed
attention to strategic communications" and public outreach and education
"to build up public awareness and resilience" and "strengthen the role
of an informed civil society in every member state" (Calha 2015, p.
10).13

[NATO declared]{.underline} its [readiness to address]{.underline} the
specific [challenges posed by "**hybrid warfare threats**" in the Wales
Summit]{.underline} Declaration [of 5 September 2014 as a forceful
response to the conflict in **Ukraine**]{.underline}.
[While]{.underline} NATO's traditional toolbox of [collective defence is
hardly]{.underline} perfectly [geared for "]{.underline}insidious and
[ambiguous threats"]{.underline} (Johnson 2015, p. 270, Calha 2015, p.
4), [countering hybrid warfare emerges as a continuing]{.underline}
relevance and [resilience test for the **Alliance**]{.underline}. NATO's
institutional responses to "hybrid threats" have been further detailed
in its Readiness Action Plan, a roadmap for building capability
packages, a comprehensive concept for creating an enhanced NATO response
force, in a classified strategy for hybrid warfare and a cyber security
action plan. [Altogether, the **ambiguity**]{.underline} and gradient
nature [of **hybrid tactics**]{.underline} directly [challenge the
ontological underpinnings of NATO's **core mission** and **strength** as
hybrid activities might "progress]{.underline} incrementally [towards a
**threatening situation** while remaining under NATO's **Article 5
threshold**]{.underline}" (Calha 2015, p. 4). [The]{.underline}
detection and [definition of a **threat**]{.underline} hence
[becomes]{.underline} significantly [less **straightforward**, pointing
at the need to renegotiate the **scope** and **substance** of NATO's
**collective defence clause**]{.underline} (i.e. Article 5 of the
Washington Treaty) [in light of]{.underline} the contemporary **[hybrid
engagements]{.underline}**.

### AT: Hybrid War K\-\--Offense

#### Hybrid war is [real]{.underline} and [dangerous]{.underline}. 

Andriy **Tyushka 19**, Senior Research Fellow in the European
Neighbourhood Policy Chair, 2019, "Hybrid War(fare): The Challenge of
Contagion," 2019, Torun International Studies, Issue 12, pp. 5--29,

Certainly, an unnecessary reverberation (if not simply a hype) of the
term bears nasty consequences for policy response as [the first
question]{.underline} being naturally [advanced is whethe]{.underline}r
the **[hybrid warfare]{.underline}** talk [is 'much ado about
**nothing'** or a **serious concern**]{.underline} about the emerging
security gap[?]{.underline} In a way, [the]{.underline} entire
[problematique gets ridiculed to the]{.underline} somewhat
[simplified]{.underline} and overgeneralized dilemmatic [question to be
resolved: is it **prudent** or **paranoid** to talk about]{.underline}
proliferating **[hybrid threats]{.underline}** and hybrid world
order[**?** Rich **empirical evidence**]{.underline}, which is only
selectively presented in the next section, [suggests a **positive
answer** to the]{.underline} afore-stated [question]{.underline}.

3\. EXPLORING HYBRID WARΈFAREΉ CONTAGION: TRENDS AND GEOGRAPHIES

[Ev]{.underline}idence from much of the public, political and academic
debate convincingly [demonstrates: the proliferation of hybrid
war]{.underline} and warfare [are more than a **'buzzword'
matter**]{.underline} -- legible [concerns about it]{.underline}
incrementally [grow across]{.underline} the [**nations**, **regions**
and]{.underline} even entire **[continents]{.underline}**, with some
being more and some less affected by hybrid war(fare) contagion. Both
public, political and academic issue [salience point to such a
**conclusion**]{.underline}.

For instance, [the hybrid war]{.underline}(fare) [topic trending
in]{.underline} public [discourse exhibits]{.underline} quite [a
**revealing picture** of **issue salience** since]{.underline} at least
[2004]{.underline}, with the European terrain being the epicenter of
public attention to the issue in question (cf. Figure 2).
[The]{.underline} geographical [spread of hybrid war]{.underline}(fare)
-- or a threat thereof, as perceived in public discourses,
[is]{.underline} most [concentrated around the top]{.underline}
topic-trending [countries, with Ukraine]{.underline} -- rather
expectedly -- [enjoying the place of the most **important locus** of
**attention**, followed by]{.underline} Poland, Estonia, Bulgaria and
Georgia, Croatia, Czechia, Latvia, Belarus, and Finland on [the top-10
list]{.underline}.

**\[Omit Figure 2\]**

In policy debate, [the hybrid war]{.underline}(fare) topic [salience can
be observed in]{.underline} a number of world's regions -- from the
topic-trending [Russia]{.underline} and the former Soviet Union space
[to integrated **Europe** and **North America**, but also **Middle
East**, **Asia** and **Africa**]{.underline} (cf. Table 1).

**\[Omit Table 1\]**

As seen from the table, hybrid warfare clearly presents a salient policy
issue for Russia's neighbours -- first and foremost, Ukraine, Belarus,
CEECs such as Poland or Czechia as well as the Baltic states. Within the
so-called Commonwealth of Independent states (CIS) alone, the situation
is quite telling as '\[e\]ach of Russia's reform-minded neighbours is
plagued by "separatism"4 \[ -- and\] it's no coincidence' (Orttung and
Walker 2015). Of course, the scope and extent of hybrid threats is
bigger than that: in addition to the weaponization of self-determination
(so-called astroturfed 'separatism'), both information and culture,
economics and democratic openness, etc., are seen being weaponized
within respective hybrid warfare stratagems.

Finally, [the ev]{.underline}idence [of hybrid war]{.underline}(fare)
topic [salience can]{.underline} also [be found in]{.underline} the
**[academic debate]{.underline}**, as the herewith undertaken
bibliometric analysis shows. Whereas the current article's effort is
concentrated on pinpointing the academic salience of the topic as
covered in major Web of Science indexed journals (cf. Figure 3), it
should be acknowledged that [the topic is covered]{.underline} much
[broadly in]{.underline} non-WoS indexed **[peer-reviewed
journals]{.underline}**. Still, the academic production corpus of WoS
indexed journals reveals the topical salience of hybrid war(fare) in
scholarly enquiries on security and defence affairs in Ukraine, the US,
Romania, UK, Poland, Russia, Czechia, Germany, Austria and Italy. A
clear gap in topic coverage by academic literature, as revealed by the
WoS corpus analysis, is rather surprising compared to other indexed
outlets as well as public and political debates -- much broader in their
geographic and issue-matter foci, with a centre of analytical gravity
that massively revolves around Russia's agency in that very context (at
the expense of a wider perspective?).

**\[Omit Figure 3\]**

Thence, with a varying intensity and focus laid on state and non-state
agency as well as geographic theatres of hybrid warfare operation, [the
topic is **clearly salient** in]{.underline} both [public, political and
academic debates, and]{.underline} this salience [is]{.underline} very
much [predicted to expand further]{.underline} -- together [with the
proliferation of the **hybrid war culture**]{.underline} and hybrid
warfare methods [among **countries**]{.underline} and regions
**[worldwide]{.underline}**.

An exponential rise of the '[hybrid warfare]{.underline}' phenomenon
[owes its dynamics]{.underline} particularly to the number of military
and politically subversive [operations Russia has undertaken
since]{.underline} early [2014 in]{.underline} Ukraine's [**Crimea**
and]{.underline} eastern regions of **[Donbas]{.underline}**. The
phenomenon is much broader both in terms of geographical and agential
spread worldwide, with some parts of Eurasia, Middle East and Asia
Pacific looming large as the hotbeds of this proliferating type of
warfare below (classical understanding of) war.

Internet search retrievals abound in references to academic and policy
writings as well as journalist investigations on the matter.

Official communications delivered by [government officials]{.underline}
and high-ranking international fonctionnaires worldwide, too,
[contain]{.underline} increasing [references to]{.underline} the
proliferation of [**'hybrid threats'** and]{.underline} the [necessity
of]{.underline} developing [a **suitable policy response**]{.underline}
-- both [in]{.underline} national and [**intergovernmental**
contexts]{.underline}.

All that points to a rather new development where the prerogatively
military term and the related vocabulary of 'hybrid warfare' lose their
exclusivity as concepts applied by, and relevant for 'military
strategists only', thus entering the everyday political and diplomatic
vocabulary as well as public discourses.

Whether in Estonia, Czechia or Poland (Schultz 2017), Germany, France or
the Netherlands, Russia's hybrid warfare operational theatre steadily
expands to new sovereign terrains of the Western liberal democracies.

Following Russia's resonant and highly plausible meddling in the 2016 US
presidential elections, in 2017, then-presidential candidate Emmanuel
Macron successfully dodged similar hack-and-leak cyber-attacks and fake
news reports widely attributable to the Kremlin. In late 2018, the
French authorities faced a renewed challenge of Kremlin's digital
offensive -- now from among 600 Twitter pro-Kremlin accounts that, under
the top hashtag #giletsjaunes, i.e. 'yellow vests', intensively fuel
outrage of street protesters. Possible involvement of the Kremlin in
amplifying the 'yellow vests' protests in France (cf. e.g.: Blakely
2018; Matlack 2018) is now being investigated by the French authorities
in spite of Russia's 'traditional' implausible denials

In response to [the Skripal poisoning]{.underline} earlier [in
2018]{.underline}, yet another widely [attributed to]{.underline} the
[Kremlin]{.underline} undercover operation in Europe and the UK in
particular, British PM Theresa May bluntly put it that '\[t\]he Russian
threat does not respect borders, and as such we are all at risk' (quoted
after: McTague, 2018). [The threat **looms**]{.underline} even more so
[large if one considers the **strategic rationale** of **Russia's hybrid
gambit**]{.underline} -- in fact, [an **undeclared war** against the
**Western-dominated world order** and the **hegemony** of]{.underline}
the **[liberal democracy]{.underline}** as such.

In this war, [Ukraine is]{.underline} only [one of the **many targets**
and **theatres**, which expand in]{.underline} both the [**scope** and
**depth**]{.underline} of engagement -- as far as the strategic and
operational goals will require

The case of [Russia's]{.underline} 'hybression'[,]{.underline} i.e.
[hybrid aggression]{.underline}, in Ukraine [is quite **illustrative**
when it comes to]{.underline} the [**contagion effects** of]{.underline}
(strategic) [**hybrid warfare** proliferation]{.underline}.

[**First**, the Blitzanschluss of Crimea]{.underline} (the so-called
'self-determination' staged by the Russian special operation forces)[,
then the]{.underline} ([failed]{.underline}) attempts to extend hybrid
incursion to Ukraine's wider South-East (the so-called ['Novorossia'
offensive]{.underline}), [successful detachment of Ukraine's eastern
areas]{.underline} (the so-called 'separatism' [in Donbas]{.underline}
region), [and]{.underline}, more [recently]{.underline}, renewed
[attempts to twist the '**Novorossia'** **offensive**]{.underline}, now
undertaken as a naval offensive [in the Kerch Strait]{.underline} of the
Sea of Azov. Not only did the geography of Russia's operational theatre
expand in Ukraine -- [every]{.underline} next [struggle]{.underline},
however narrow (MacFarquhar 2018), [risks **wider war**]{.underline}

Fifth year on, [the contagion of Russia's **hybrid warfare**
can]{.underline} now however [be traced far beyond **Ukraine's
borders**]{.underline}. Already back in 2015, Zbigniew Brzeziński, a
senior political scientist and former adviser to the US-American
President Jimmy Carter, was not sparkling with optimism as the Russian
war in Ukraine was concerned. In the wake of his March 2015 visit to
Poland, he put his advice for the compatriots in a very succinct and
unequivocal passage: 'Ukraine is not the endpoint. We have to be ready
to defend ourselves' (Brzeziński 2015).

Time and again, [Polish]{.underline} intelligence agency ABW and
investigative [journalists uncover Russia-linked **subversive groups**
who]{.underline} -- via disinformation campaigns or political subversion
(astroturfing, false flag outrage) -- seek to [exacerbate
tensions]{.underline} both [within the **Polish society** and with
**Ukraine**]{.underline} -- [to sow **discord** between **Poland** and
**Ukraine**]{.underline}, thus directly or indirectly promoting the
Kremlin's interests (DW, 2018). [The **tension** in]{.underline}
Polish-Ukrainian [relations]{.underline} may [resonate well
beyond]{.underline} the confines of [this bilateralism]{.underline}, not
least in the context of Poland's role as a key supporter of pro-Western
policy attitudes in Ukraine and pro-Ukrainian policy attitudes in the
European Union, both of which run contra Kremlin's illiberal script for
the post-Soviet space.

Up north in the Baltics, the spread of [Russian hybrid warfare became
a]{.underline} serious [political concern the]{.underline} very [moment
Russia annexed **Crimea** from **Ukraine** in]{.underline} early [2014.
Whether the Baltic states were]{.underline} (to be) [next, has
been]{.underline} since then [one of the **permeating questions** in
**security debate**]{.underline} both within the small region and
Europe-wide (Radin 2017).

A number of other European countries and [Western democracies have been
affected by]{.underline} the spread of [Russia's hybrid war]{.underline}
from Crimea to Salisbury, for the past five years now. [Whereas
tracing]{.underline} (and predicting) [the contagion]{.underline}
effects [of hybrid warfare]{.underline} in toto [is]{.underline} quite
[a daunting task]{.underline} -- not least because of the problematic
means identification and agency attribution, [its main **components**,
such as **information weaponization**]{.underline} (fake news spread,
public and media propaganda campaigns) [or '**weaponized
self-determination'**]{.underline} (external orchestration, partisan
sponsoring or otherwise supporting of 'self-determination' processes
regionwide), [can be feasibly analyzed]{.underline}. For instance,
[Cunningham and Sawyer's]{.underline} (2017: 598) **[spatial
analysis]{.underline}** of the spread of self-determination claims --
statistically -- [confirms]{.underline} that that [self-determination is
**contagious**]{.underline}, for the onset of self-determination claims
in a country is strongly predicted by the onset of self-determination
claims in the neighbourhood. [The observations]{.underline} of the
micro-regional dynamics in Eastern Europe and South Caucasus
well-[illustrate such a contagion -- from **Nagorno Karabakh** to
**Transnistria**]{.underline}, form [**Abkhazia** and **South Ossetia**
to **Crimea** and]{.underline} (partially) [**Donbas**, and]{.underline}
to a smaller extent, **[Gaugauzia]{.underline}**. Rather unsurprisingly,
[Russia's orchestrating]{.underline} or other-how instrumental efforts
behind these processes [have been **disentangled** and]{.underline}
moderately well **[documented]{.underline}**. With Putin's
Blitzanschluss of Crimea in 2014, [the debate about]{.underline} the
challenges of a [weaponized 'self-determination]{.underline} in the age
of Putin' (Simpson 2014) [loom large]{.underline} -- and not only in the
context of lasting fears in the Baltics about the externally-strategized
secession of Latvian Latgale or Estonian Narva provinces; [the concerns
grow in]{.underline} 'old [Europe']{.underline}, too, especially [after
Russia's]{.underline} considerable politically [subversive effort was
identified behind the]{.underline} 2017 [Catalan referendum]{.underline}
in Spain (Palmer 2017; Emmott 2017; Alandete 2017b; EFE 2018)
[and]{.underline} the '**[Brexit']{.underline}** campaign [in the
**UK**]{.underline}, which, in a way, too, can be seen as a case for (a
different but still a kind of) 'self-determination' -- i.e. British
determination to 'depart' away from Brussels and the EU's institutional
embrace. Importantly, one should, to a lesser extent, perceive such a
subversion driven by the Kremlin as a hostile act strictly against
respective nation-states, or at least nation-states alone (Cohen and
Radin 2019) -- [such a weaponization of '**self-determination**'
processes]{.underline} in Europe [targets the **European Union** and its
**transatlantic links**, which stand in the epicentre of **Russia's
fight** against the]{.underline} liberal democratic hegemony of the
**[Euro-Atlantic order]{.underline}**. Bonet (2017) put it quite
eloquently when referring to the Russian influence campaigns in Spanish
Catalonia: 'Russia's official media speak about Catalonia, but they are
really shooting at Brussels, using the referendum as ammunition'

The [Russian uses of **referenda** as part of **political
warfare**]{.underline} campaigns abroad are not limited to the cases of
self-determination. Its uses [span across a variety of]{.underline}
deliberative [democratic]{.underline} policymaking [processes --
from]{.underline} policy-consultative **[referenda]{.underline}**, such
as the 2016 Dutch referendum on the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement or
the 'Brexit' referendum (Ostanin and Rose 2016), [to **electoral
campaigns**, such as]{.underline} the [2016 US]{.underline} presidential
[elections, German]{.underline} 2017 [parliamentary
elections]{.underline} (Applebaum et al. 2017), [French 2017
presidential elections]{.underline} (Dearden 2017), etc. The evidence
abounds that the 'weaponization of referenda' has meanwhile successfully
broadened in its use as part of the hybrid warfare toolkit. NATO
Parliamentary Assembly STC's most recent report on Russian meddling in
elections and referenda in the Alliance (cf. Davis 2018) draws on the
collected evidence of the Kremlin's past elections and referenda
influence campaigns in the US, UK, France, Germany, Spain and the
Netherlands, and argues that [such]{.underline} interference [operations
pose a]{.underline} serious [**threat** to the **Alliance** and its
members, especially]{.underline} when seen [against the **broader
efforts** of Russia to **divide**, **destabilise** and]{.underline}
otherwise [undermine **Alliance** **members**]{.underline}.

[Russia's hybrid warfare proliferates]{.underline}, however, well
[beyond the **weaponization** of '**self-determination'** and
'**referenda**' campaigns. It includes]{.underline} a range of
activities in [stirring up **dissent**]{.underline} abroad [-- from
influencing **campaigns**]{.underline} [to financial **military** and
**political support** of]{.underline} local [**radical groups** or
**insurgent forces**]{.underline}. In this context,
[Afghanistan]{.underline} [is]{.underline} yet [another]{.underline}
largely [overlooked **grey zone** of Russia's]{.underline} proliferating
**[hybrid war]{.underline}** [against the **West**]{.underline} sought
to undermine the latter's global hegemony and resources in sustaining
it, inter alia by provoking -- mainly the US -- to fight on several
fronts (cf. e.g: Sazonov 2017). Casting a look at Afghanistan (again!)
and actively courting the Taliban through arms supply and diplomatic
conciliation amidst still designating it a terrorist group and
domestically outlawing as such (cf. e.g.: Ramani 2019) has little good
reason and military-strategic promise -- if not considered against the
Kremlin's prima facie irrational (but no lesser deployed for that very
reason!) strategy of inducing a 'manageable chaos'5 , i.e. an operation
in shaping a strategic environment conducive to Russia's broader
political warfare against the West. In the Kremlin's forceful drive
against the international liberal order and the 'power of rules', [the
strategic value of]{.underline} a spread of [**ambiguity**,
**uncertainty**, **chaos**]{.underline} and hesitation (be it via
proliferation of grey-zone conflicts and hybression of sorts,
weaponization of migration, populism or the rise of the so-called
illiberal democracies, etc.) [can **hardly be
overestimated**]{.underline} (cf. e.g.: Tyushka 2018).

[Reviving]{.underline} dormant [ethnic]{.underline}-political
[tensions]{.underline}, sowing distrust, exaggerating tensions up to
[staging coups (such as the attended coup in
**Montenegro**]{.underline}, cf.: Higgins 2016) [is]{.underline} yet
[another modality of **political warfare** the Kremlin wages in the
**Western Balkans**]{.underline}, in addition to the heating-up of
separatist and revisionist movements (Bechev 2018).

Ironically enough, hybrid warfare campaigns can, too, spread to include
deceptively 'integrative' agendas. As the pressure of Western sanctions
and tensions between Russia and Belarus grow, the discussions on
Russia's possible hybrid invasion of Belarus have started to unfold
among regional security scholars, especially after their joint 2017
'Zapad' ('West') military drills (Wilson 2017) and more recent Kremlin's
calls for a closer integration between Russia and Belarus (Applebaum
2019).

Even though the prominence of Russia's hybrid warfare in the region
abounds in its scope and intensity, [it would be wrongful to attribute
**all**]{.underline} the endeavor and 'brilliance' in contemporary
practices of **[hybrid warfare]{.underline}** [to Russia]{.underline}
alone: [a number of other state]{.underline} and non-state
[actors]{.underline} worldwide, unilaterally or collectively, [resort to
**hybrid tactics**]{.underline} in support of their diverse strategic
goals -- [from **China**, **India**, **Pakistan**, **Qatar** or **Iran**
to the **US**]{.underline} (cf. Figures 2 and 3, and Table 1 above). In
the Middle East, Iran and Qatar come to the fore of attention. Dalton
(2017: 312) posits that, for as long as the past three decades, [Iran
'has grown **proficient**]{.underline} at [using hybrid-war
capabilities]{.underline} and tactics to achieve its regional
objectives', typically [operating below the threshold of]{.underline}
conventional [warfare]{.underline}, thus 'using a blend of military and
paramilitary tools, including proxy forces, missiles, cyber tools,
maritime forces, and information operations to share and coerce regional
actors to its advantage'. Supporting non-state actors, like Hezbollah
and other proxy groups from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan or Pakistan, forms
part of the Iran's regional leverage toolkit. In Asia and its regional
security architecture, proliferation of hybrid warfare may, too, be
fraught with systemic consequences. Niruthan (2016) contends that,
already now, '\[m\]any of the conditions that breed hybrid threats are
ripe for harvest in the Asian continent, with its ethnic conflicts, a
vibrant tech industry, territorial disputes, and inconsistent rule of
law'. [Whereas the topic reappears]{.underline} more [frequently
in]{.underline} the discussions of [China's]{.underline} 'legal alchemy'
and [political subversion around the **South China Sea**]{.underline}
dispute, potential [cradles of hybrid]{.underline} warfare in Asia may
also [become **Burma**]{.underline} (Myanmar), [**Thailand** or
**Pakistan**, with the latter]{.underline} one [becoming]{.underline}
incrementally [framed in]{.underline} the regional [political discourses
as]{.underline} both [a **target**]{.underline} (Khan 2018) [and a
**wager** of **hybrid warfare**]{.underline} in its rivalry with India
(AFP Kargil, 2014; Kumar 2017).

Evidently, the geography and uses of hybrid war(fare) manifest contagion
effects, which remain underexplored in the subject-matter literature.

Asymmetric threats

**[Against]{.underline}** the **[challenges]{.underline}** and
geopolitical processes [in the **modern**]{.underline} period
[**world**, **research of the challenges**]{.underline} coming [**from**
**asymmetrical threats** and **hybrid warfare** is]{.underline} very
[**important**. The world faces]{.underline} a number of [challenges
that cannot be solved without a **united effort**]{.underline}.
Therefore, [it becomes necessary to create **alliances** and
enhance]{.underline} the effectiveness of **[international
organizations]{.underline}**. Coming from the current situation of
today's reality and geopolitical changes the role and the function of
[NATO is]{.underline} very [important in]{.underline} world
**[security]{.underline}** issues. Since the establishment of the North
Atlantic Alliance, [ensuring **collective defence**]{.underline} and
security is one of the main principles and purposes of functioning of
this organization that require the Alliance to prevent the land, air and
naval attacks with united forces, however, in modern times the Alliance
[faced new challenges]{.underline} that come [from **asymmetric
threats** and **hybrid warfare**]{.underline}.

The security trends play the great role in the process of forming a new
system of international relations. In the past few years, one can often
hear the reasoning that the nature of war in the twenty-first century
has changed. Non-state structures even a century ago used partisan
methods of warfare, and the beginning of the twentieth century was
marked by the use of terrorist tactics.

[Before we]{.underline} begin to [talk about **asymmetric threats**
and]{.underline} a **[hybrid war]{.underline}**, it is important to
[consider what these]{.underline} two [phenomena mean]{.underline} and
what role they play in global security. During the consideration of the
hybrid war, it is interesting to pay attention to the asymmetric warfare
factor - [asymmetric war represents]{.underline} such [a war when the
military powers of]{.underline} the [opposing sides clearly
differ]{.underline} from each other. The military tactics or the
strategy used by them are very different from each other.

The term [asymmetric warfare is]{.underline} used when
[describing]{.underline} situations such as [guerrilla warfare,
terrorism, insurrection]{.underline} and during such armed conflicts
when regular military force confronts an irregular, ill-armed opponent.

The term became popular in 1975, when Andrew J. R. Mack, wrote in
academic journal World Politics, \"Why Big Nations Lose Small Wars,\"
where he used an asymmetric war to determine the differences between
important military forces among the parties involved. In the word
\"power\" he meant the material strength, like a large army, good
weapons, a developed economy, etc.

As for the connection of the asymmetric war with terrorism, there are
different opinions on this issue. In today\'s world, asymmetric warfare
is being increasingly considered as a part of the fourth generation war.
Some believe that if the asymmetric war goes beyond the rules of war, it
turns into terrorism. In addition, some believe that the asymmetric war
is not connected with terrorism. They believe, because of the propaganda
of the strong parties, it identifies the weaker party as bandits or
terrorists. They also believe that the word terrorism is specifically
used for political purposes because of its negative significance. [One
of the **main security problems** of the **modern world** is
asymmetrical threats, such as]{.underline} international [terrorism
and]{.underline} transnational [organized crime]{.underline}; Weapons,
[including **weapons** of **mass destruction**]{.underline} and its
components[; Also]{.underline} illegal drugs and drug trafficking; Human
trafficking, [**cybercrime**, and the **fourth generation
war**]{.underline}. There are many other types of confrontations -
rebellion, civil war, revolution, etc.

The tactical [success of **asymmetric wars** depends on several
components]{.underline}. On the example of technological advantage - [if
any party has]{.underline} a [**technological advantage**, this can
outweigh the enemy\'s **numerical advantage**. Neutrality of
**technological advantage** is possible on]{.underline} important [enemy
facilities and with an attack on **infrastructure**. With
attacking]{.underline} the [electrical power]{.underline} lines or
generators, roads, pipelines or water. In heavily populated places, such
[sabotage can]{.underline} greatly [affect]{.underline} the [**morale**
and **economics**]{.underline} of people inhabiting the territories.
[The weaker side]{.underline} in such a war [uses **special
tactics**]{.underline} to cope with a strong opponent. You can break the
rules of war and use them for your own good. The rules of war prohibits
the use of a medical machine for asylum, an attack or an ambush, and the
use of urban settlement for military bases is also prohibited. The
weaker side uses such tactics with the hope that the opposing party will
defend the rules of war and not attack the city2 .

[The]{.underline} beginning of the [21st century brought]{.underline}
about [non-conventional]{.underline} security [threats]{.underline}
(they include [natural disasters]{.underline}, drug, weapon and human
[trafficking, **cyber warfare** and piracy]{.underline}, etc.) [which
represent]{.underline} new [challenges for]{.underline} those
[international organizations that consider maintenance of **security**
and **stability** as their **principal goal**]{.underline} on either
global or regional levels. [The **North-Atlantic Alliance** has taken
the responsibility for addressing]{.underline} these new
[challenges]{.underline}3 .

[Today **NATO** provides]{.underline} its [capabilities and resources to
assist]{.underline} international and regional [organizations in
tackling crises and resolving]{.underline} a wide range of
[problems]{.underline}

Asymmetric warfare used to be determined as "a conflict including two
states with different total military and economic resources". However
after 9/11 attacks the definition has been adjusted, Asymmetric warfare
is now defined as "using inferior tactical or operational strength
against the vulnerabilities of superior opponent to achieve the
disproportionate effect with the aim of undermining \[the opponent's\]
will in order to achieve the asymmetric actor's strategic objectives."4

The problem of terrorism is not only the problem of a single country but
also the first enemy of international security. The terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001 (9/11) led to a more clear perception of the threat
of terrorism. Terrorism has become the most acute issue after this
incident, and maintains the considerable attention of the international
community until now.

After 9/11 terrorist attack, NATO instantly expressed support for U.S.
For the first time NATO activated the Article 5, which envisaged the
collective protection of member states at risk. The purpose of this
action was not only America fighting against terrorism. Europe joined
the events of 9/11. The fight against terrorism became the mainstay of
EU member states.

While we start talking about the factor of hybrid war in the modern era,
let us see what the existing theories and their authors are saying about
the hybrid war. In general, [there are two]{.underline} basic mental
[approaches around]{.underline} the [**hybrid war.** Some researchers
think]{.underline} that [a \"**hybrid war**\" is a **reality** that
needs to be understood. They think]{.underline} that [this is
**separate** from the **traditional** and non-**traditional
possibilities** of creating a **war**, although it includes
**both**]{.underline}. [According to the **second part** of the
**researchers**, the \"**hybrid war\"** by its **content** consists of
the fact that it is not new for the **stories** of creating a
**war**]{.underline}, [does not need **branches** and is easily
described with the help of comprehension of the **historical
perspective**]{.underline}. In general, it can be said that the vast
majority of researchers agree that in the form of creating a modern war,
there are novices that need attention. The main question is how new this
phenomenon is in the framework of the historical perspective.

At present, the term \"hybrid war\" has a significant place in the
political dictionary. Over the past decade, a new military strategy has
become more relevant in the world political arena.

In the Euro-Atlantic space, the number of conflicts that are not part of
the Western category of war is growing. We can say that the analysis of
these conflicts show the modern idea of a hybrid war, in which we see an
intentional combination of forms of war to achieve strategic goals.

Modern American military analyst of conflicts, Frank Hoffman in various
forms of analysis of hybrid threats defines as follows: \"hybrid threats
if the enemy at the same time uses conventional weapons, irregular
tactics of terror-ism and criminal behavior, as well as a combination of
military operations to achieve political goals.\"5

Military experts of the United States during the XX century introduced
the concept of military planning together with the concept of \"hybrid
threats\" and, consequently, the new concept of \"hybrid wars\" - a form
of warfare that includes different composition, means, and level of
training and characteristic of forces - was created. However, what makes
a hybrid challenge the new phenomenon is the growing importance of
non-military means. This is a modern form of war, which focuses
primarily on achieving strategic goals without physical confrontation,
especially at the initial stage of the conflict.

Conventional (regular) warfare is, according to NATO's definition,
warfare where regular opponents, officially enlisted as states, are
engaged and regular tactics and activities are used, while respecting
international treaties, conventions and laws.

Irregular warfare, according to available NATO's definitions, represents
a warfare that denotes a form of conflict, where one or more
protagonists adopt irregular methods. Additionally, "irregular troops
are any combatants not formally enlisted in the armed forces of a
nation-state or other legally constituted entity." Other definitions
describe it as "a violent struggle among state and nonstate actors for
legitimacy and influence over the relevant populations. Irregular
warfare favours indirect and asymmetric approaches, though it may employ
the full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode an
adversary's power, influence, and will. "Moreover, irregular opponents
are unlikely to adhere to recognized treaties and international
conventions. On the other hand, they are likely to rely on local
support, fight in the place they live and they are often hard to
distinguish from local civilians. The irregular opponents' tactic will
often include undermining and eroding target's will and determination.
The tactic also includes avoiding regular decisive deployment of
national forces, and if necessary, then preferably under the terms and
circumstances chosen by the irregular opponents.

[Hybrid warfare]{.underline} in NATO's view is a violent conflict
applying combination and simultaneous use of conventional and irregular
warfare, involving both state and non-state actors, used adaptively in
pursuit of their objectives and not limited to physical battlefield or
territory. Each attack contains its own combinations and mutations of
the two and targets further aspects of state and society to undermine it
and reach its goals. Hybrid warfare can be employed in conflicts not
only by states and armed forces but also by a variety of actors beyond
the authority of states. (Such as terrorist or extremist groups.) [Even
though the **phenomenon** is **hardly new**, what is **new** and
**surprising** is the "scale of use and exploitation of **old tools** in
**new ways**."]{.underline}6

**\[Omit Fig. 1\]**

Hybrid methods of warfare, such as propaganda, deception, sabotage and
other non-military tactics have long been used to destabilize
adversaries. [What is new about attacks]{.underline} seen in recent
years [is their **speed**, **scale** and **intensity**, facilitated
by]{.underline} rapid [technological change and global
interconnectivity. **NATO** has a strategy on its role in countering
**hybrid warfare** and stands ready to defend the **Alliance** and all
Allies against **any threat**, whether **conventional** or
**hybrid**]{.underline}.

Highlights

\- [The]{.underline} primary [responsibility to respond to **hybrid
threats** or **attacks** rests with the **targeted
nation**]{.underline}.

\- [NATO is prepared to assist any **Ally** against **hybrid threats**
as part of **collective defense**. The Alliance]{.underline} has
[developed a **strategy** on]{.underline} its role [in countering
**hybrid warfare**]{.underline} to help address these threats.

\- In July 2018, NATO leaders agreed to set up counter-hybrid support
teams, which provide tailored targeted assistance to Allies upon their
request, in preparing for and responding to hybrid activities.

\- NATO is strengthening its coordination with partners, including the
European Union, in efforts to counter hybrid threats.

\- NATO's Joint Intelligence and Security Division has a hybrid analysis
branch, that helps improve situational awareness.

\- It also actively counters propaganda -- not with more propaganda, but
with facts -- online, on air and in print7 .

Hybrid threats include cyber-attacks, disinformation, economic pressure,
the destruction of non-permanent armed forces and the use of regular
forces, which is of military and non-military importance. [The most
important work of **NATO** is the **prevention** and **destruction** of
**hybrid attacks**]{.underline} (the scale and frequency of which has
greatly increased in recent years) and it does not matter whether it
comes from government or non-state bodies. Hybrid methods first blur the
boundary between peace and war and begin to be a problem for NATO. Since
2015, NATO has begun to fight with this warfare. To this end, NATO will
prepare the Alliance and Allies to the extent that they can provide it
all. For constant readiness, NATO continually gathers, exchanges and
evaluates information to ensure any necessary activity. An integrated
intelligence and security unit at NATO Headquarters assists this
process. The hybrid analysis department provides maximum information on
hybrid threats. Together with the abovementioned, [NATO]{.underline}
also [supports allied in]{.underline} civic [preparedness]{.underline}
and response [to chemical, biological, radiological and
nuclear]{.underline} (CBRN) [phenomena; protects critical
infrastructure]{.underline}, strategic communications, [and energy
security, combats terrorism, and]{.underline} also [provides cyber
defense]{.underline}, which is very important. To implement all of the
above, it is very important to conduct trainings and checks, which will
make the fight against hybrid threats much effective

NATO can hold up hybrid threats much faster and more agile, and each
time it improves preparedness for the fight and the decision-making
process and the management of defense and control. It also shows that
the Alliance is also strong in political and military efficiency and in
a quick decision-making process. In the event that the struggle becomes
impracticable, NATO, with its speed and flexibility, at any time and in
any place protects its allies from any attacks.

To strengthen and improve the fight against hybrid threats, NATO
continues to cooperate with Finland, Sweden, Ukraine and the European
Union. The European Union and NATO have especially strengthened their
cooperation against cyber-attacks and are successfully conducting this
process.

For better experience, centres of excellence (international research
centres) provide the alliance with more knowledge at the national or
multinational level.

In October 2017, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, together with
the European Union Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security
Policy / Vice President of the European Commission Federica Mogherini,
opened the European Centre of Excellence for Combating Hybrid Threats in
Finland, which supports 14 countries to improve their capabilities and
preparedness to counter hybrid threats8 .

New Security Challenges: The Emergence of 'Hybrid Threats' as Challenges
to Peace and Security

Multimodal, low intensity, [kinetic as well as non-kinetic **threats**
to international peace and security, including **cyber war**,
**asymmetric conflict** scenarios, **global terrorism**,
piracy,]{.underline} transnational [organized crime]{.underline},
demographic challenges, [resource security, retrenchment from
**globalization**, and]{.underline} the [proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction were identified and labelled by NATO as '**Hybrid
Threats**']{.underline}, as threats 'posed by adversaries, with the
ability to simultaneously employ conventional and non-conventional means
adaptively in pursuit of their objectives'

Having identified these threats, NATO undertook work on creating a
comprehensive conceptual framework, a Capstone Concept, which was to
provide a legal framework for identifying and categorizing such threats
within the wider frame of possible multi-stakeholder responses. In 2011,
NATO's Allied Command Transformation (ACT) supported by the U.S. Joint
Forces Command Joint Irregular Warfare Centre (USJFCOM JIWC) and the
U.S. National Defense University (NDU) conducted specialized workshops
related to 'Assessing Emerging Security Challenges in the Globalized
Environment (Countering Hybrid Threats \[CHT\]) Experiment'.

These workshops took place in Brussels, Belgium, and Tallinn, Estonia,
and aimed at identifying possible threats and discussing some key
implications when countering such risks and challenges. The findings of
the workshops were published in the ACT's final report and
recommendations in 2011.

Hybrid threats faced by NATO and its non-military partners require a
comprehensive approach allowing a wide spectrum of responses, be it
kinetic and non-kinetic by military and non-military actors. Such a
comprehensive response will have to be in partnership with other
stakeholders, such as international and regional organizations as well
as representatives of business and commerce. However, due to a lack of
financial resources in general, and an absence of the political will to
create necessary 'smart defence' capabilities among its member states,
NATO decided in June 2012 to cease the work on CHT at its organizational
level while encouraging its member states and associated NATO Excellence
Centres to continue working on hybrid threats9 .

At present, [information warfare is the **main component** of the
**war**]{.underline}, which means influencing the masses through access
to the media, getting support for some idea and making the client\'s
policy. Information warfare often includes informative, propagandistic,
psychological, and cyber components and the characteristic of the
\"hybrid war\" is the use of integrated financial resources, material
resources and hidden military means.

A new type of war in the North Atlantic alliance, [the \"**hybrid
war**\"]{.underline} that unites all elements of a new strategy, is
called tactics, when military facilities are not used. The war [contains
elements of **propaganda** and **disinformation**, as well
as]{.underline} forced use of [**economic pressure** and **Special
Forces**]{.underline}. This kind of war is referred to as \"soft
power\". Today, the main component of the war is \"informational war\",
which means influencing the masses through access to the media, getting
support for some idea and making a client\'s policy. \"Informative war\"
often combines information-propaganda, psychological and cybercrime.

[A vivid example]{.underline} of such a conflict [is]{.underline} the
[Russian aggression against]{.underline} [**Ukraine**. The appearance of
Russian militaries in Crimea without the **marking signs**]{.underline}
(\"hidden faces, hidden management and controls\") directly
[means]{.underline} the [secretive use of **Special
Forces**,]{.underline} which is [one of the main elements of
this]{.underline} kind of [war]{.underline}. The use of such forces,
which do not have any marks, in military opera- tions, allows Moscow to
carry out an active campaign of rejection, aiming to mask its military
intervention. Russian television is actively using militarist propaganda
to mitigate and justify aggression

[It is worth noting the **cyber-attack** on **Ukraine**. Russia\'s
actions against Ukraine are a good example of how cyber operations can
be **integrated**]{.underline} [into conventional **military
operations**]{.underline}. [Cyber-attack]{.underline} and anti-state
propaganda [campaigns]{.underline} of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict
[were carried out by DDoS attacks against **Ukrainian
media**]{.underline} [and government organizations, as well as on
NATO]{.underline} and NGO sites. In addition, Russian communications
intelligence used the data on the Internet to determine the location of
the Ukrainian military units in eastern Ukraine.

Former NATO advisor on security issues, General Frank Van Kappen, was
one of the Western analysts who described the Russian-Ukrainian conflict
as a \"hybrid war\" on 26 April 2014.

It is possible to say that the \"hybrid war\" theory of the
Russian-Ukraine conflict has been created. This type of war has already
been recognized as \"hybrid war\" - one of the major challenges,
confirming a new strategy against the threats by NATO in December 2015.
As NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at a meeting of the NATO
Foreign Ministers in Brussels, the Alliance will agree with the EU in
implementing a new strategy, as the hybrid war contains both military
and civilian elements. The emergence of a hybrid war as a new form of
conflict fundamentally alters the existing landscape and provides many
questions about the possibilities of security systems10 .

Finally, we can say that \"[Information War]{.underline}\" [is one of
the most **important threats** of the **XXI century**]{.underline},
[which threatens **international security**]{.underline} in addition to
internal state relations. This can be used that support the recent
history of the Russian Federation from the \"information war\" as the
use of technology (2008) and Ukraine (2015-2016 years) against. Briefly,
let\'s review the results of intelligence impact on the national
security system of Georgia in the summer of 2008. Analysis of events
allows us to assume that its northern neighbour used not only
traditional ways of attack - by land, sea and air, but also implied the
fourth, relatively new, but the most effective way of attack in terms of
information, including cyber-space. According to the report published by
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia in August 2009, the Russian
citizens and their sympathizers on 7-16 August 2008 carried out a
coordinated attack that destroyed dozens of important web pages,
including the web pages of the President, Defence Minister, National
Bank of Georgia and other state agencies. Turns out, that cyber- space
protection (including the threat of a timely response to the propaganda)
in terms of intelligence and counterintelligence measures completely
collapsed.

The stability of national security depends much on each individual
component of international security. One of the major and general
components in the world today are considered the danger coming from
asymmetric threats and hybrid war, which seriously threaten the national
security and strategic interests of the states. [The world
faces]{.underline} a number of [challenges that cannot be **solved**
without a **united effort**]{.underline}. Therefore, with the purpose of
prevention of similar threats and minimization of the risks, [it is
necessary for states to take]{.underline} appropriate [steps toward
**cooperation**]{.underline}, [where **collective security** is granted
with]{.underline} big significance and the necessity for forming
**[alliances]{.underline}**, increasing the effectiveness of
international organizations, defending the international security system
and protecting of global security occur. [NATO plays an **important
role** in tackling]{.underline} existing [threats]{.underline}, has a
strategic concept and takes preventive measures to combat threats. [NATO
has a variety of approaches]{.underline}, which are brought forward in
its new conceptual documents, [to ease]{.underline} the [existing
challenges]{.underline} and threats.

Security is especially important in the era of globalization, when
economization, democratization, informatization creates unprecedented
opportunities for development, but at the same time makes the
international relations system more vulnerable against challenges such
as terrorism, weapons of mass destruction to use.

Conclusion

The increasing popularity of the use of asymmetric threats and hybrid
operations in more and more parts of conflict areas rise questions how
to adopt traditional Western conventional warfare so that it is able to
face new challenges of the 21st century. The future conflicts will
however no longer be possible to categorise only as conventional or
irregular, state or non-state. NATO has mechanisms, means to combat
actively asymmetric, and hybrid threats. The world is facing global
threats, risks and challenges that make international security
vulnerable with the development of new technologies. The development of
technologies in the XXI century has brought many benefits to the
society, but in terms of intelligence and \"informational war\" for its
implementation, it has led to many threats. The security trends and new
challenges play a major role in the establishment of a new system of
international relations. After the Cold War, NATO\'s successful
transformation and regulation of non-traditional security threats is the
basic prerequisite for the globalization of the international role of
the alliance.

Asymmetric threats and hybrid warfare affect the global security
environment, which makes the global security environment vulnerable to
modern threats. Despite global changes in the world, NATO has managed to
establish peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area. After the end
of the Cold War, when the main enemy of the Warsaw military bloc was
disintegrated, there was the illusion that NATO had exhausted its
function and could have dissolved. NATO underwent a transformation in
the post-Cold War period, which significantly strengthened the Alliance
and helped stabilize the balance of the power in the world. Today, NATO
successfully cope with new challenges and threats of the 21st century
and makes a significant contribution to the international security
system.

the day in apparent unison further provides NATO and the EU a silver
lining of a tightened cooperation between the two organisations. Further
research could map the complex interactions between the OS-seeking
strategies of these distinct intergovernmental institutions and their
member states/societies with regard to countering hybrid warfare. It
would be interesting to investigate, for example, how the traditional
lines of division within the European community along the more
Russia-friendly and Russia-wary countries might tap into the
institutional dynamics of hybrid threat management of the EU and NATO.
Moreover, the newly established special sub-institutions to confront
hybrid threats within the EU along with the organisationally
unaffiliated Centre of Excellence could themselves develop their own
identities, OS drives and placating routines, potentially generating
organisational fragmentation and inter-agency tensions instead of
bolstering the OS of the Union as a whole (cf. Steele 2017).

With regard to [the [**ethical drawbacks** of]{.mark}]{.underline}
effective **[[hybrid]{.mark} threat [management]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
such an endeavour [[point]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[at the]{.underline}
[problematic prospect of compromising the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**already [fuzzy distinction]{.mark}** [between **politics** and
**war**]{.mark} --]{.underline} as [[according to]{.mark} the **[hybrid
war]{.mark}fare [paradigm]{.mark}**[, all politics]{.mark} becomes
[reduce]{.mark}d [to the]{.mark}]{.underline} potential [[**build-up
phase** for a]{.mark} full-blown
**[confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In that sense, hybrid warfare
is close to the criteria of "minimal wars, which consist in merely
threatening the enemy with negotiations held in reserve" (Clausewitz
1976, 604, emphasis in the original). [The]{.underline} alleged
"[minimality]{.underline}" [of such a]{.underline} way of
[warfare]{.underline} nonetheless [has]{.underline} considerable
[potential to induce **broad** and **deep securitisation**
of]{.underline} various [public policy]{.underline} processes in the
Western societies and their supranational organisations in question.
Hybrid warfare and the emerging institutionalisation of its countering
practices highlight the paradox of defending democratic security
communities, as the efficacy of such defence might in fact be
detrimental to some of the core organising principles of democracy.

[[An **alt**]{.mark}**ernative** approach would be to [argue]{.mark}
that **[hybrid war]{.mark}fare**[, and]{.mark} the [**countering
practices** it is generating]{.mark}, have]{.underline} simply
[[brought]{.mark} **the nature** of **the [modern power]{.mark}** out
[into the open]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Foucault maintains in his
Society Must Be Defended, [[liberal]{.mark} "**[civil peace]{.mark}**"
[must be understood as a **secret**]{.mark} **form of [war]{.mark}**[,
for "**war** is the **principle**]{.mark} and motor of the **exercise**
[of **political power**" in general]{.mark}]{.underline} (Foucault 2003,
p. 18). Viewed from such a perspective, [**[hybrid war]{.mark}fare**
[and]{.mark} its]{.underline} emerging [**[management]{.mark}
practices** [by]{.mark}]{.underline} the EU and [[**NATO** enable us to
see what **politics** is]{.underline}]{.mark} allegedly [all about
**anyway** -- "[the **continuation of war** by **other
means**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Foucault 2003, p. 15). For the EU and
NATO, [**[hybrid war]{.mark}fare** [embodies]{.mark} not just the
**unsettling** of the politics/war distinction but raises [the
**fundamental question** about the]{.mark} practical [distinguishability
of]{.mark} their [**physical** and **ontological security**]{.mark} in
the **first place**.]{.underline}

### AT: Hybrid War K\-\--AT: Terminological Ambiguity

#### Hybrid war is [not ambiguous]{.underline}, and there isn't a [universal formula]{.underline} to describe its contents.

Since the early 2000s, the rise of the 'hybrid warfare' term can hardly
go unnoticed. From a new term in U.S. military and operational code,
introduced with the 2005 National Defence Strategy Review, to a
consolidating phenomenon in strategic studies and a proliferating
buzzword in public and political debates, especially in Europe, the
notion of ['hybrid warfare' seems to be living a life of its
own]{.underline}. Coined by Hoffman (2009) as a way to describe modern
fanatical fighting styles, supported by new technologies and deployed in
the shadow of state agency (no full deployments of army, no uniforms --
and no need to obey the laws of armed conflict), [the]{.underline}
'hybrid warfare' [term is]{.underline} now [used]{.underline} and abused
[in many possible ways -- including]{.underline} the [cases in which it
is]{.underline} misleadingly [equated with]{.underline} the idea of
['hybrid war']{.underline}, understood as something less than war. [The
lack of clarity]{.underline} as to what is what [is]{.underline}
particularly [disturbing as the term(s) **virally spread**]{.underline}
in public and political debates as well as academia. Hardly any security
journal or a strategic studies event save an effort in addressing the
'complexity' of the notion. [Some find it **fancy** and **meaningless**,
some]{.underline} -- [revolutionary but **evasive** in]{.underline} its
[conceptualization]{.underline} (cf. e.g. a critique of the literature
by Johnson (2018)). [The term seems to be **broad** and
**flexible**]{.underline} enough to encompass many things at once -- and
different things in different contexts, wherefore it is often used as a
catch-all term for all non-linear threats. And [yet, the idea is
**rather simple**: modern technology]{.underline} has [enhanced
the]{.underline} known [modes of **warfare** as]{.underline} well as [it
enabled]{.underline} the [discovery of new **battlefields**, **methods**
and '**fighters'**]{.underline} -- beyond armed troops. NATO's 2014
Wales Summit declaration described 'hybrid warfare threats' as 'a wide
range of overt and covert military, paramilitary and civilian measures
\[that\] are employed in highly integrated design' (NATO 2014). As such,
[they 'blend the lethality of **state conflict** with]{.underline} the
fanatical and protracted fervor of **[irregular warfare']{.underline}**
(Hoffman 2009: 37). The notion is therefore not constrained to a
particular set of fighting methods or a particular agent of war -- it
can equally be deployed by any state and non-state actor and will hardly
be deployed in precisely the same manner twice -- and, thus, can hardly
be 'calculated'. Critiquing Fox and Rossow's (2017) attempt at 'making
sense of Russian hybrid warfare' on their sixteen-page working paper
published by the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare, Ricks (2017) laments
that '\[t\]hey offer a series of unsatisfying summaries of other
experts' unsatisfying claims, and come up with an unwieldy version of
"hybrid war = information operations + unconventional + cyber +
conventional, spread out along an axis of covert and overt operations"'.
This can be said about much of the literature on the subject trying to
find and 'patent' [the universal formula of **hybrid
warfare**]{.underline} applicable in any context and in any part of the
world -- which [does not exist, **of course**: every instance of
this]{.underline} evolving warfare [campaign has]{.underline} its
[specific **sources**, **strategic** and **operational goals**,
**battlefield(s)** and **tactics**]{.underline} -- all within a
particular hybrid war strategy.

[What can be said with]{.underline} (a greater) [**certainty**, is that
this]{.underline} twenty-first century [art of warfare is
**multi-modal**, **multi-theatric** and **multi-agential**.]{.underline}
Hybrid wars begin long before the first shots are fired, if at all.
[With the use of]{.underline} both overt and especially covert means
such as external financial and organizational support of [democratic
tools]{.underline} (referenda, elections, other public participation and
influence campaigns) [or less 'visible']{.underline} information or
**[cyber operations]{.underline}** in target countries, [the challenge
is to]{.underline} instantly and [firmly attribute an
**action**]{.underline}, or a result thereof, t[o a hostile foreign
agency]{.underline}. Both public debates, policymaking processes,
digital transactions or physical battlespace may [become]{.underline}
theatres of warfare in hybrid strategies. In hybrid warfare,
[conventional]{.underline} military [operations are not excluded --
they]{.underline} just [form the **latest operation level**. Before
that]{.underline} moment[, the place of]{.underline} uniformed [soldiers
is taken by soldiers **without insignia**]{.underline} (special forces,
private mercenaries), [astroturfed **irregulars**]{.underline}, troll
and bot 'armies', [cyber hackers,]{.underline} criminal
[racketeers,]{.underline} captured or corrupt [elites,
**propagandists**]{.underline}, psychologists [and]{.underline} by
manipulated **[media]{.underline}**. In their 2012 book, Williamson
Murray and Peter R. Mansoor define hybrid warfare as a 'conflict
involving a combination of conventional military forces and irregulars
(guerrillas, insurgents, and terrorists), which could include both state
and nonstate actors, aimed at achieving a common political purpose'
(Mansoor 2012: 2). Thereby, '\[i\]rregular forces need not be centrally
directed, although in many cases they form part of a coherent strategy
used to oppose an invader or occupation force' (Mansoor 2012: 3). The
range of ['hybrid actors']{.underline} is, too, context-dependent and
may [include]{.underline} any combination from the variety of
interpenetrated state and non-state agents -- from [**insurgent** or
**terrorist networks**, organized crime groups, **social
groups**]{.underline} (such as clans, tribes or ethnic groups), and
ideologically or religiously motivated organizations, all of which may
be backed covertly, or overtly, by states and/or legitimate businesses
(Schroefl and Kaufman 2014: 867).

Ethics of Securitization

As discussed in the literature review, [[securitization]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} most [often [discussed as a
'**negative'**]{.mark}]{.underline} [concept]{.underline} for several
reasons. First of all, securitization argues that the normal democratic
procedures for decision makers be abandoned in favor of a streamlined
decision-making process handled by a small elite that dictate policy on
security related issues. [Critics assert that securitization
is]{.underline} something largely [inconsistent with the openness and
accountability that]{.underline} [liberal democratic systems
value]{.underline}, [therefore]{.underline} securitization [is something
'negative' to be avoided]{.underline} in societies that place true
importance on these values. [But [what if **the issue**]{.mark} **being
securitized** [is a **direct threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} those very [democratic procedures themselves. Are there
issues [that **deserve to be securitized**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[for the **common good**]{.underline}, [and can government
policies have a **positive impact on society** when these issues are
**securitized?**]{.underline}

[Experts on **disinformation**]{.underline} [warn of the **dire
potential** that such **propaganda** can have on a society]{.underline},
and argue that liberal democracies are especially vulnerable to them.
New technologies have made the 21st century into a completely different
type of information space than its predecessor. [The internet has
decentralized and democratized the flow of information]{.underline} to
the point where somebody sitting on a laptop at home may be able to make
the same impact with a blog as a major newspaper with an article. [With
less institutional control and traditional media gatekeeping on the flow
of information, the internet is a **truly democratic
platform**]{.underline}.148 These democratic processes; freedom of
information, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and free
elections; are precisely what make liberal democracies so vulnerable to
disinformation and propaganda. With knowledge of these asymmetric
vulnerabilities[, the Kremlin **consciously aims** "to **take
advantage** of the **free flow of information** in a democratic society,
the **effect of that information on public opinion**, and the
**electoral mechanisms**]{.underline} [through which public opinion
determines a country's leadership]{.underline}."149

[One foundation of a democratic society is the ability to make decisions
in the public forum **based on shared truth**.]{.underline} When voters
go to the polls, they may make a judgement on which candidate or which
proposal they favor based on the information that they have consumed.
Traditionally, they may differ on what course of action may be the best
way to handle a problem, but there is an agreed upon reality that is a
matter of fact; it is shared. [Disinformation, from Russia and other
actors hostile to the West, **promotes falsehoods** to the point where
society **cannot have a shared truth**.]{.underline} Imagine four people
each with a different source of news. One reads the New York Times, one
watches Fox News, one reads Breitbart, and one watches RT. Each one of
these people will not only come to radically different conclusions about
what solutions are best for society, but also about what the basic facts
of reality are in the first place. One person may be out on the streets
protesting the disappearance and rape of a young Russian girl by Muslim
migrants, while the next person may be aware that the story is a
complete falsehood that never happened to begin with. [[Russian
efforts]{.mark} in the EU [show]{.mark} that [these situations **are
not**]{.mark} **a hysterical [fear-mongering]{.mark} reaction to new
technologies**]{.underline} and new sources of information,
[[but]{.mark} that they are **already a [reality]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[Disinfo]{.mark}rmation [creates]{.mark} a situation where people can
have **[opposing realities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [because the
information they consume is **so radically different**]{.underline}
[from that of their neighbor.]{.underline} [**[Critical theory]{.mark}**
in international relations **[warns]{.mark}** that
[securitization]{.mark} **[subverts]{.mark} democratic
[decision-making]{.mark} processes**]{.underline}, [[but
**disinfo**]{.mark}**rmation** [**destroys** these]{.mark} very
democratic [processes]{.mark}]{.underline} that are so fundamental for
liberal democratic societies to function the way they are intended. It
is impossible to imagine normal democratic processes solving these types
of problems when those processes are being eroded by propaganda to the
point where Western societies may no longer have normal democratic
processes if this trend continues. In order to maintain these democratic
norms, [securitization may be a **necessary**]{.underline} [process,
even a 'positive' concept that can yield positive results]{.underline}
and protect the democratic values that have propelled the European
project into existence.

From the perspective of states, it is difficult to see why they would
not wish to securitize the issue of Russian disinformation more. States
tend to place an emphasis on matters of physical and territorial
security over all else, which is why issues such as nuclear weapons, or
rising military power in China, or international terrorism are
prioritized in terms of security policy. States' desire for physical
security explains why these issues tend to be some of the most
securitized political issues, with decisions made regarding military
policy in Afghanistan by military panels rather than public referendums.
Walt, arguing from the realist perspective, argues that states "place
particular emphasis on the preservation of the state's territorial
integrity and the physical safety of its inhabitants." 150 Material harm
is of the utmost importance while more ethereal issues, like democratic
procedures, freedom of the information space, and societal resilience
towards propaganda are not prioritized in the same way. Disinformation
has threatened some of the building blocks of democratic societies
throughout the EU, and if these democratic systems fail, it isn't
difficult to imagine that physical security would come under threat as
well. In the case of Spain, the issue of the Spanish government's
territorial sovereignty over Catalonia was attacked by Russian
disinformation, exacerbating the political wounds of the independence
referendum. The disinformation campaign questioned Spain's fundamental
right to exist in its current form, yet Spain did not place the
integrity of their media space as an important security issue despite
this. There needs to be a shift in the importance and value that
European democracies place on the fundamental democratic principles that
allow their system to flourish. They should be prioritized with the same
importance that states place on more traditional measures of power.
Securitization of disinformation with the liberal democratic system and
democratic processes themselves as the referent object, has the
potential to have a more 'positive' outcome than emphasis on hard power,
or immigration, or other issues that contribute to the 'negative'
conception of securitization.

Successful Securitization and Societal Resilience

In the case studies it is clear that [some European countries have
securitized Russian disinformation while some have not.]{.underline}
Namely, the United Kingdom and Lithuania have successfully securitized
disinformation, while Spain, Germany, and the supranational institutions
of the EU have not securitized disinformation. Those that have not
securitized, have identified Russian disinformation as a perceived
security threat and have several securitizing actors currently at play.
The potential audiences of the securitizing speech acts, those within
the security apparatus, NGOs, think-tanks, and even the wider public of
these countries have accepted that Russian disinformation is a security
threat that warrants greater action by their governments. Thus far, they
have not taken measures that could by any means be considered
extraordinary, having allocated a relatively small number of resources
and minimal effort towards combating disinformation, and therefore
cannot be considered to have securitized the issue. These countries, and
the EU, are possibly in the early stages of the process of
securitization, though this does not necessarily mean that they will
complete the process by taking more extraordinary measures against
disinformation. In fact, there could be a reversal and disinformation
could slip back into the realm of normal politics and become
desecuritized.

Some [clear trends emerge in the countries who have **successfully
securitized disinformation**]{.underline}. First[, propaganda narratives
have a **weaker effect on society** when disinformation **has been
securitized**,]{.underline} [**failing to have their desired
impact**]{.underline} and cause major rifts in the public. They also
show that [securitization of disinformation is possible **without**
implicitly **violating** democratic norms of freedom of speech and open
access to information]{.underline}. This becomes clear in looking at the
contrast between Lithuania's countermeasures against disinformation
compared to those of Germany and Spain. In Germany, the Lisa case was
dealt with almost exclusively via the normal criminal and legal
channels, with the police investigation into Lisa's accusations of
kidnap and rape by migrants and police handling of most public
statements related to the controversy. 151 They have begun to enact
minor laws that aim at punishing hate speech and disinformation when
posted on popular social media platforms as well.152 Spanish authorities
have started task forces devoted to alerting the national government
when disinformation narratives start to dominate a story online. 153
Spanish and German officials at the higher levels of national authority
in their respective foreign and defense departments gave minimal
statements regarding the controversies, and have preferred to continue
dealing with Russia through dialogue over more overt confrontation that
could complicate communication. Both Germany and Spain have taken a more
reactive approach to countering disinformation, choosing to deal with it
on a case-by-case basis as an incident unfolds.

Lithuania has taken similar messages to alert national authorities on
dangerous narratives as they develop online, but it has also taken
extraordinary measures that encompass a broader scope. The Lithuanian
government has supported efforts at every level of society; political,
economic, educational, and cultural. 154 Their wide spread programs
focus not only on dealing with each case as it emerges, but also on
strengthening the fundamental resilience of society at the source
through teaching media literacy in secondary schools, funding Russian
language media for the susceptible minority group, and sensitizing the
public to the dangers of propaganda by making disinformation a security
issue linked to the physical security and existence of the state.155
Their bans on Russian media channels during disinformation campaigns,
while possibly construed as violations of a free press, are necessary to
prevent media from spreading out right falsehoods. The news media, both
Lithuanian and Russian language, should be held accountable and has a
responsibility to act as a gatekeeper of the truth. Many media channels
in Lithuania have voluntarily chosen to follow such a route, choosing
not to report on 'fake' news stories that can be detrimental to society
by becoming 'real' news through regurgitation by legitimate media
outlets. It is important not to confuse the right of free speech of an
individual with that of a news organization with ties to a foreign
country, and such acts should not be considered violations of democratic
norms when it comes to protecting the fundamental values of democracy.

[The **countermeasures** taken by a country]{.underline} undoubtedly
[play a role in the **impact** disinformation narratives may have in
that country. With Lithuania's '**successful' securitization** of
disinformation]{.underline}, [**fake stories** and attempts at
**propaganda** have often **fallen on deaf ears**]{.underline}, with
little real success. [Lithuania's overarching, comprehensive strategy at
countering disinformation is the **reason** the NATO rape
allegations]{.underline} **[failed to cause a large
disruption]{.underline}** [in the news cycle.]{.underline}156 [This
**strong contrast** is seen with Germany, where the story of a rape by
migrants of a young Russian girl caused an **uproar** and **led to
protests in Berlin**]{.underline} [and a **diplomatic row with
Moscow**]{.underline}. 157 Spain also fell short, with Russian
disinformation exacerbating a contentious independence referendum in
Catalonia and influencing public opinion at home and abroad on the
status of Catalan autonomy. [[Government policies that **fail to
securitize** ]{.mark}**disinformation** and **alert
society**]{.underline} [to the **dangers of propaganda**]{.underline}
[[lead to **false stories** having **explosive
consequences**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Both Spain and Germany's strategies of dealing with disinformation
narratives as they arise is simply not effective enough. The state can
spend time and resources trying to discredit every fake news story that
finds its way to the public forum, but there will always be one to take
its place. It is like fire prevention; a fire alarm can be an important
part of fire prevention, alerting the fire department to come extinguish
a blaze. But there are more important measures as well, such as building
structures with fire resistant materials, or teaching people what to do
in case of a fire. These types of continuous measures, like the policies
Lithuania pursues, make society more resilient and prevent
disinformation from causing a fire in the first place.

[Policies aimed at improving societal resilience towards disinformation
are being utilized in other countries with successful outcomes as
well]{.underline}. Latvia uses a sweeping media literacy program from an
early age to improve critical thinking in its citizens.158 Finland, a
country with a long history of hostility with Russia, uses similar
programs, emphasizing not only the need to publicly correct false
narratives, but also the importance of creating a positive
counternarrative to disinformation that is repeatedly applied to offer
an alternative vision.159 [These countermeasures **only appear** in
countries that have **securitized disinformation**]{.underline}, as
Finland and Latvia have similar histories as Lithuania and treat
disinformation in similar terms, and they are much more promising than
government authorities attempting to play catchup with internet trolls
and false stories.

Internationalization of Countermeasures

Another key conclusion comes from the other [case of successful
securitization in the United Kingdom. The UK, in its **securitization of
disinformation**]{.underline} [following the assassination attempt on
Sergei Skripal, **internationalized the threat**]{.underline} [by
creating a set of countermeasures]{.underline} [that could be
implemented **along with its allies**]{.underline}. The UK successfully
convinced 20 allies to expel Russian diplomats in a coordinated effort
at punishing Putin's regime for the incident and the subsequent
disinformation surrounding it.160 [Theresa May, as a securitizing actor,
not only convinced her public in the UK of disinformation as a security
threat,]{.underline} [but **convinced the international
community**]{.underline} [that such behavior "**threatens the security
of us all**]{.underline}." 161 Compared with the minimal Spanish
attempts at coordinating counter disinformation at the EU level, and
German attempts to keep the Lisa Case under the authority of Berlin's
police department[, British efforts at securitizing their incident by
bringing it to the **attention of the international community** and
launching a **unified response** were **highly
successful.**]{.underline}

This lesson of internationalization should be critical for the EU to
deal with disinformation. [[Securitization needs to take place]{.mark}
not only at the **national level** of member]{.underline} [states, but
also [at the **supranational level**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}of
the EU as an institution. The EU itself is under threat of Russian
disinformation just as much as individual member states, with experts
warning of further regionalization of Europe and the EU after Brexit. In
this critical time for the continued existence of the EU, [the threat of
disinformation "[requires]{.mark} new [international instruments]{.mark}
to manage it." 162 Thus far, member states have shown a preference for
taking **individual routes**]{.underline} in order to deal with
disinformation. [The importance **of joint initiatives**]{.underline}
[could be especially important during **elections**]{.underline}, a time
in which the ability of national and EU authorities to cooperate is
critical. During the European elections of 2019 for example, consisting
of four days of simultaneous elections across 28 individual member
states, "the failure of one government to properly mitigate
disinformation efforts threatens the credibility of the entire electoral
process." 163 This problem of coordination cannot be understated, as
some countries do not even have their own systems in place to monitor
disinformation, allowing "local and national actors to spread fake news
more freely" and leaving these countries defenseless against
propaganda.164

[It is essential]{.underline} for the EU [to act as a
**bloc**]{.underline} [and start **joint initiatives**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} **[counter disinformation]{.underline}**. [Russian
efforts]{.underline}, as shown in the case studies, are not exclusive to
one particular area of Europe, but **[threaten all member
states]{.underline}**. Issues Russia chooses to target; the migrant
crisis, espionage, the use of chemical weapons in a member state, the
solidarity and legitimacy of the NATO, and even the territorial
sovereignty of some countries; should alarm every single member of the
EU. These issues are not unique to one country, but they are issues that
countries even outside of the EU are currently confronting. Europe is
targeted as a bloc, and therefore it should respond as a bloc. Such a
response, as seen in with the UK's diplomatic expulsion, has a larger
impact as a bloc rather than individually. Division will only encourage
more provocations. [Acting on a **unified front** in securitizing
disinformation and reacting with countermeasures will do much more
[to]{.mark} potentially **[deter Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} from
continuing down the same path in its relations with Europe. The EU needs
to stop hesitating, and start throwing its full weight on the economic,
political, and informational fronts.

'Positive' Securitization

The two [trends discussed in the sections above also show that
[disinfo]{.mark}rmation [can be securitized **without**]{.mark} **wide
[violations of democratic norms]{.mark}** and]{.underline}
**[exclusionary tactics]{.underline}** [towards Russian minorities in
Europe]{.underline}. [By arguing for securitization, this paper is not
arguing that democratic principles should be **thrown out** in favor of
**extraordinary measures**]{.underline} [that subvert the democratic
process]{.underline}, indeed the democratic process is of the utmost
importance because these principles are the referent object of a
European push to securitize disinformation. [And according to
polls]{.underline} in all of the countries involved in the case studies
and the EU as a whole, [the general public agrees that disinformation
**constitutes a security threat**]{.underline} that could be detrimental
to liberal democratic norms. Efforts like media literacy, cooperation
with news organizations, and comprehensive strategies that deal with
disinformation at every level of society are still extraordinary without
necessarily violating democratic norms. These [[policies]{.mark} [aim to
**sensitize the public** ]{.mark}**to
disinformation**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [They **do [not]{.mark}** aim
[to]{.mark} **[monitor]{.mark} the public [in a surveillance
state]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[and]{.underline} **[punish
individual views]{.underline}** that are unfavorable to European states.
[On the other hand, these policies are not afraid to prevent large news
outlets from **spreading lies** that harm the ability to make democratic
decisions **based on shared truths.**]{.underline} [Diplomatic expulsion
and unprecedented international cooperation on information issues are
extraordinary]{.underline} [measures taken **without abuse of state
power**]{.underline} [as in the **War on Terror**]{.underline}.
[Policies that aim to provide alternative news sources to Russian
speaking minorities in Europe **are not** **exclusionary
'othering**]{.underline},' [but are **inclusive**]{.underline} [and
offer a **broader**, **diverse**, and]{.underline} **[more
positive]{.underline}** [view]{.underline} [of the Russian diaspora than
as a monolithic fifth-column prone to side with Moscow and Putin's
regime over their new homes.]{.underline} These policies need to be
inclusive to mitigate the risk of disinformation and the subsequent
disillusion with European governments. A conscious, just policy of
securitization of disinformation must take democratic principles,
inclusion of diverse viewpoints, and the treatment of Russian minorities
into account while avoiding the misuse of state power in order to
succeed.

While traditional military measures are still considered the hallmark of
inter-state conflict, [[Russian **strategic thinking**]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [increasingly
**[highlighting]{.mark}**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [**[strategic
importance]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[non-military]{.underline}**, **[[asymmetric]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[and]{.underline} **[indirect]{.underline}** [[measures]{.underline},
[including]{.underline}]{.mark} military and non-military
**[[IPb]{.mark} operations]{.underline}**, [in its **multi-domain
approach**]{.underline} [to conflict in the 21 st century]{.underline}.
[According to the Chief of the Russian General Staff]{.underline},
Valeriy [Gerasimov]{.underline}, [IPb is the **only means**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[conflict resolution]{.underline}** which spans
across all stages of modern inter-state conflict and encompasses both
military and non-military means (see Figure 2).23 The complexity of its
role further increases during the initial stages of kinetic conflict
operations. Reflecting a desire to minimize military confrontation
during these stages, the ratio of non-military and military measures is
described as 4:1.24

The novelty of Gerasimov's perception of modern conflict (often
described as the Gerasimov Doctrine) and the role of information in
conflict resolution should not be overstated.25 The literature on
Russian IPb emphasizes that contemporary [information operations
demonstrate that "the Kremlin is falling on a time-honoured strategy in
its propaganda war."26 Indeed, Russian leaders have operationalized
information for strategic purposes since at least the Revolution. The
Soviet government developed and systematically applied active measures
and deception techniques that were intensive, persistent in times of war
and peace, worldwide in scope, and centrally coordinated in a way that
was not mirrored by Western governmen]{.underline}ts.27 Informational
psychological operations were coordinated by the political leadership
and implemented by the state security apparatus, specifically the KGB
(and its predecessors) and to a lesser extent the GRU, both domestically
and internationally.28 Initially these operations were orchestrated on
an ad-hoc basis, but by the late 1970s, an institutionalized system for
coordinating and implementing them had been fully established. These
overt and covert, non-military and military information operations were
referred to by Soviet intelligence services as active measures. In 1982,
the CIA described active measures as "an unconventional adjunct to
traditional diplomacy. [They are **quintessentially** an **offensive
instrument** of Soviet policy]{.underline}."29

The 1970s saw an organizational restructuring within the KGB and CPSU
that signified an increase in the perceived strategic importance of
active measures. According to a Ladislav Bittman, a former active
measures agent for Czechoslovak intelligence (one of the most successful
and loyal satellites of the KGB) who defected to the West, this
organizational change was the result of an evolution in the perceived
strategic importance of active measures that unfolded in three stages
after World War II.30 In the first stage (1945-1948), active measures
were characterized by an ideological emphasis on communism. In the
second stage (1948-1959), the Soviet Union sought to increase the
efficacy of active measures by making them appear more objective. To
achieve this, the Soviet Union dialed back the overt ideological
emphasis of its propaganda and used communist front organizations and
Soviet satellite intelligence services to conceal its role in
coordinating active measures.

Bittman notes that the Soviet government valued active measures as
secondary to intelligence collection in the first and second stages and
that this hierarchy of values visibly reversed in the third stage, which
began in 1959 with the establishment of a department of active measures
within the First Chief Directorate of the KGB. Many Soviet satellite
intelligence services soon established similar departments which carried
out orders from the KGB in addition to their own operations. Throughout
the 1970s the Soviet government formally established an
institutionalized structure for coordinating and implementing active
measures (see Figure 3). This process began in 1970 when the active
measures department of the KGB was elevated to a special service called
Special Service A within the First Chief Directorate. Special Service A
was responsible for carrying out active measures which were coordinated
by the International Department (ID) of the Soviet Communist Party
(CPSU). The ID assisted the Politburo in coordinating policy by liaising
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, military, Academy of Sciences, the
KGB, and non-ruling foreign communist parties.31 In 1978, the CPSU
established another department for coordinating active measures: The
International Information Department (IID).32 The IID was responsible
for improving the effectiveness of Soviet propaganda abroad and
improving treatment of foreign affairs by domestic media. Service A of
the KGB managed the implementation of active measures coordinated by the
IID as it did for the ID.

When exploring the causal mechanisms behind the institutionalization of
active measures, one cannot overstate the influence the anti-war
movement in the United States during the Vietnam War had on Soviet
strategic thinkers. The movement demonstrated the potential efficacy of
exploiting peace movements and public opinion in democratic societies to
achieve political and security objectives.33 The foundation for this
strategy was embedded in Bolshevik and then Soviet strategic thought
which embraced the Marxist-Leninist notion that the struggle for peace
is constant and characterized by conflict.34

This same notion of constant conflict is reflected in Gerasimov's chart,
particularly with respect to the role of IPb, since it is the only means
of conflict resolution which is applied across all phases of conflict.
The role of IPb in the Gerasimov Doctrine should therefore be
interpreted as an evolution enabled by technological innovation,
globalization, and the changing nature of conflict rather than a
revolution in Russian strategic thinking about conflict.

Contemporary Russian strategic thinking about IPb developed within the
body of thought known as New Generation War \[voyna novogo pokoleniya\],
or NGW. Sergei Chekinov and Sergei Bogdanov published the seminal
article on this concept in 2013. Entitled "The Nature and Content of a
New Generation War," the piece describes thinking within the Russian
Ministry of Defense about the nature and content of warfare in the 21st
century as well as how to prepare for and emerge victorious from it. 35
NGW emphasizes the growing importance of non-military, asymmetric, and
indirect means of conflict resolution over traditional military
methods.36 The theory of victory reflects an effort to achieve reflexive
control \[refleksivnoe upravlenie\] without resorting to the military
subjugation of the adversary.37 Under NGW, traditional kinetic military
measures are used only after non-military measures and non-kinetic
military measures fail to achieve strategic objectives or de-escalate a
conflict. Figure 4 provides a graphical illustration of NGW and the
Gerasimov Doctrine.

Dima Adamsky provides a useful description of Russian NGW strategy using
Western nomenclature while avoiding the cognitively and conceptually
problematic terms such as hybrid warfare. Borrowing from the body of
thought on cross-domain deterrence, he develops a concept called Russian
cross-domain coercion. Cross-domain coercion "refers to the host of
Russian efforts to deter and to compel adversaries by orchestrating soft
and hard instruments of power across various domains, regionally and
globally." 38

NGW first arose as a way to think about Russian military policy in light
of U.S. advances in high-precision, non-nuclear military technology and
its impact on the nature of conflict in the 21st century. 39 U.S.
operations in the First Gulf War and NATO operations in the Balkans
during the Yugoslav wars were perceived by Russian strategic thinkers as
a watershed in the evolution of conflict. The advanced military
technology utilized by the U.S. and its allies allowed them to carry out
military operations remotely and with high precision, thereby decreasing
the need for the type and level of mobilization characteristic of
previous conflicts of the 20th century while simultaneously increasing
U.S. and NATO power projection. Russia, which was suffering through an
economic crisis after the collapse of the Soviet Union, was not in a
financial position to develop symmetric countermeasures to U.S.
advancements in non-nuclear military capabilities. In light of this
economic disadvantage, Russian strategic thinkers sought to
conceptualize a theory and develop a strategy for countering U.S.
conventional superiority using asymmetric, including non-military, and
less costly methods.40 Chekinov and Bogdanov note that the importance of
this intellectual effort was highlighted by President Putin during a
speech to the Federal Assembly in 2006 when he remarked: "We must
consider the plans and development trajectories of the armed forces in
other countries. We must be aware of perspective innovations. However,
we must not chase after quantitative indicators...Our response must be
based upon intellectual superiority. It will be asymmetric and less
costly."41

Justification for the informational component of NGW was provided by the
collapse of the Soviet Union, the Color Revolutions, particularly those
in the post-Soviet space, and Arab Spring.42 Chekinov and Bogdanov argue
that U.S. information warfare techniques were a major factor
contributing to the collapse of the Soviet Union.43 The perceived
effectiveness of these techniques increased with the development of the
Internet and social media. Russian strategic thinkers expressed alarm at
the role of the Internet as a vehicle for undermining regime stability
in the countries affected by the Color Revolutions and Arab Spring. They
were further alarmed by Western financial, informational, and special
operations support for anti-regime NGOs and political parties/movements
in those countries. Such support, they contend, is a form of hybrid
warfare that constitutes a violation of national sovereignty and is thus
illustrative of Western aggression.

Conclusion

This thesis aimed to identify similar processes occurring throughout the
EU by analyzing how four individual member states have approached the
issue of disinformation. In looking at incidents of disinformation in
the UK, Germany, Lithuania, and Spain, research was conducted to analyze
the incidents themselves and how governments responded, placing that
response into the wider context of securitization within those
countries. It is clear that [there is an **ongoing process of
securitization** taking place in Europe around the issue of
**disinformation**]{.underline}. [Not all countries]{.underline}
researched [have demonstrated that disinformation has been **fully
securitized**]{.underline}, but every country had elements of
securitization taking place, such as securitizing actors and speech acts
meant to draw attention to propaganda as an existential security threat.
While these countries did show the initial factors in securitization
occurring, they chose to deal with disinformation through the route of
normal politics rather than extraordinary politics. It can be concluded
that [the]{.underline} [**[level of securitization]{.underline}** [of
Russian disinformation]{.underline}]{.mark} **[within a
society]{.underline}**, [that is the treatment of propaganda and false
narratives as a security threat and how deep a country is within the
process of securitization, [played]{.mark} a **direct [role]{.mark}**
[in **shaping**]{.mark} **the [policies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [those
countries pursued in order to **counter disinformation**]{.underline}.

Examining the different cases, the research showed how history,
experience, and threat perceptions related to Russia influenced
securitization of disinformation. The United Kingdom securitized Russian
disinformation in the aftermath of a catalyst event, the attempted
assassination of former GRU agent Sergei Skripal and the subsequent
disinformation campaign in its aftermath. The UK government propelled
disinformation to extraordinary politics in its diplomatic expulsion of
Russian diplomats coordinated with its allies. Lithuania securitized
Russian disinformation over a long period of time because of its complex
history with Russia and the Soviet Union, and its experience of a slow
barrage of disinformation since it regained independence. Due to decades
of experience, Lithuania pursues a more comprehensive strategy at
countering disinformation, which seeks to address the threat at multiple
levels of society and multiple stages as false-narratives spread.

It was clear that other countries, and the EU as an organization, had
not fully securitized Russian disinformation, although they showed signs
they were in the process of securitization. Germany, in response to a
young girl's explosive accusations of rape in the context of the migrant
crisis, showed a clear preference for dealing with disinformation
through the normal political channels of Berlin's police department.
Spain took minimal responses through its foreign and defense ministries
and is still in the early stages of instituting policies aimed at
alerting the government to disinformation narratives. As a bloc, the EU
also failed to enact extraordinary policies to counteract disinformation
from Europe's Eastern neighbor, with a lack of coordination between the
individual member states and the supranational EU bodies.

[While some countries have securitized disinformation, other have chosen
a different route, and]{.underline} we can see how the **[different
policies]{.underline}** [enacted by these countries can either **protect
society**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[make society more
vulnerable]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[disinformation]{.underline}**. [Those [countries that]{.mark} have
**[securitized disinformation]{.mark}** have]{.underline} also
[[had]{.mark} the **most [success]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[countering]{.mark} [it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Continuous [policies
that]{.mark}]{.underline} not only track disinformation narratives and
discredit them as they emerge on a case-by-case basis, but also
[**[build resilience]{.mark}** at the source through]{.underline}
[policy efforts]{.underline} in the social, cultural, educational, and
political realm [[have **proven more effective**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Media literacy, Russian language programming, and public statements
exposing false stories can all have an impact. [[Disinformation
narratives]{.mark} have often [failed to cause]{.mark} the
same]{.underline} **[[explosive consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in
those countries that have instituted]{.underline} **[comprehensive
strategies]{.underline}** [to counter it.]{.underline}
**[[Internationalization]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of
counterdisinformation policies]{.underline}, **[[seeking
solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} [joint]{.underline}
[initiatives [with]{.mark} **like-minded [allies]{.mark},**]{.underline}
[has also [proven]{.mark} more [effective]{.mark}]{.underline}
[cultivating societies that are **less vulnerable** to **fake
news**]{.underline}. Diplomatic expulsions, online tracking, and
coordinated alert systems have the potential to ensure that the more
vulnerable countries in the EU do not let disinformation exert influence
on political processes and thereby endanger the bloc as a whole.

[This [paper]{.mark} has also [argued against '**negative'**]{.mark}
**conceptions** of [securitization]{.mark} in relation to the issue of
disinformation]{.underline}. It has warned that [[disinformation
**is**]{.mark} **indeed [a security threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
liberal democracies in the West, [[with]{.mark} its [ability to
**destroy**]{.mark} **foundations of [shared
truth]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially
~~cripple~~ \[**[destroy]{.underline}**\] [[democratic]{.mark}
decision-making [processes]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [While **critical
IR**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**theorists** believe]{.mark}
[securitization should be **avoided**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [protect openness and accountability, and frame the
process in a **negative light**]{.underline}, this paper has argued that
[[securitization is]{.mark} a **[necessary]{.mark} protective
measure**]{.underline} [[and **does not inherently lead to abuse of
state power**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Policies]{.mark} [pursued]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} the case study [countries that]{.mark} have
**[successfully]{.mark} [securitized

**extraordinary**]{.underline}, [[countermeasures]{.mark} against
disinformation **[do not]{.mark} necessarily need to [violate]{.mark}
the [democratic values]{.mark} they are meant to protect.**]{.underline}
[These policies do not need to be **exclusive** towards Russian
minorities, but [can be **inclusive**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[contribute to public life]{.underline}**. If
European countries and the EU as an institution value the democratic
principles that govern their societies, [a conscious, successful
securitization of disinformation may be beneficial and even have
'**positive' results**.]{.underline} [[**Viewing disinformation as a

### AT: Psychoanalysis

#### Can't scale up psychoanalysis -- sweeps historic and cultural forces unique to [state political units]{.underline} [under the rug]{.underline} 

R.D. **Hinshelwood 16**, Professor of Psychoanalytic Studies at the
University of Essex, 5/11/2016, Reflection or action And never the twain
shall meet,
https://freudconference.wordpress.com/2016/05/11/reflection-or-action-and-never-the-twain-shall-meet/

[There is a **major problem in using psychoanalysis in political
activity**]{.underline}. [The [unconscious individual
influences]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} the [external social ones
are essentially different]{.mark} categories, and can be
bridged]{.underline} conceptually [only with]{.underline} some
[difficulty. I have been struck for some time by the **conceptual
divergence**]{.underline}. In 1996, making an attempt to understand the
convergence between a social (contemporary Marxist) explanation and an
internalist, psychoanalytic explanation of human personality and
experience, I noted that both paradigms are avowedly materialist; so,¶
[Economic activity and bodily experiences create separate theories
\[but\] they also generate **separate superstructures**]{.underline} --
the world of social relations and the world of object relations
respectively... \[T\]he two superstructures converge. They lean together
and coincide At certain points, we have dealt with three of those points
-- oppression/repression, alienation/depersonalisation and
commodity/identity (Hinshelwood 1996, p. 100-101).¶ In this Chapter, I
return to this paradigm, and take further the
alienation/depersonalisation point of convergence. The dialectical
relations can be unpacked as several interactive cycles,¶ Group dynamics
and the Labour Party¶ Back in the 1990s, I was part of a group that
worked out some ideas which we might take to the Labour Party. You may
remember that the dying regime of the Conservatives, Mrs Thatcher and
John Major was hanging on, and with the election in 1997 coming up, the
Labour Party was desperate to convince the electorate of its better
policies. The idea was whether we could give an account of group
dynamics which might be helpful to Labour to understand the way to
create a more democratic society. At the time Labour were talking about
'the third way'; somewhat vague, but it appeared that it might promote
more measured attitudes in Society suggestive of depressive position
thinking -- ambivalence, considerateness towards everyone, and generally
a reluctance towards the unrealistic perfectionism of ideologies. It
seemed there could be a match between the political rhetoric and the
study of unconscious group processes. In the event when we met a couple
of people at Millbank, it was clear they were politely indifferent to
what we were trying to present. Their interest was whether we had the
secret of how to influence the electorate to vote for Labour. They
wanted advice on their marketing. There seemed a radical disconnection
between our earnest views about a more mature society, and their wish
for effective marketing.¶ I have thought, over the years, about our
naïvety. Obviously there is a potential for psychology to be used as a
social and public instrument for manipulation, and later, I came across
the writing of one of the founders of marketing and public relations, in
the US back in the 1920s. He wrote,¶ If we understand the mechanism and
motives of the group mind, is it not possible to control and regiment
the masses according to our will without their knowing about it?
(Bernays 1928, p, 71).¶ and¶ The conscious and intelligent manipulation
of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important
element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen
mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the
true ruling power of our country (Bernays 1928, p.37).¶ I find this
unpalatable. Shamefully, this author, a founder of this 'invisible
government' as he called it, was Edward Bernays, Freud's nephew. He,
like Freud, was interested in the 'unseen mechanisms' at work in
individuals -- but for different purposes. ¶ Political change and
psychoanalytic change¶ [The aim of psychoanalysis is to change
things.]{.underline} That is what patients want help with. [The aim of
politics is also to change things. But the changes, and how they are
brought about, are completely different. Is that difference
bridgeable?]{.underline} [Influencing a patient towards some healthy
state, and doing the same for society, shouldn't be impossibly
different. After all a society is made of people. So what really is the
difference,]{.underline} and how can one inform the other?¶ [[Practising
psychoanalysts address the internal unconscious]{.mark} factors that
determine an individual's personality --]{.underline} and how the
individual is captured and controlled by them. [On the other hand,
[political attitudes and actions are socially generated]{.mark},
arising,]{.underline} many would say, [from the economic system of
production. [The individual is located at the junction of these two sets
of influences]{.mark}, one from inside and one from
outside.]{.underline} If someone has [a phobia for spiders]{.underline},
he [is driven by internal factors]{.underline} (his unconscious
imagining, say, that the web-like embrace is a controlling mother). [If
someone drives his car on the left-hand side of the road, it is from
social forces -- the highway-code, police patrol cars,
etc]{.underline}.¶ [These are inherently different kinds of
influences.]{.underline} How do social and unconscious determinisms fit
together? [Edward Bernays decided it is simple, the external social
category is used to manipulate the individuals' interior unconscious
choices]{.underline}. Well.... for me [that is not good
enough]{.underline}, and I am interested in whether there are other ways
by which these two categories of influences can be combined in our
understanding). ¶ Interpreting society!¶ I claim we need to find models
of interaction between social relations and psychodynamics. [[It
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, otherwise, [so [easy for]{.mark}]{.underline}
us, [[psychoanalysts]{.underline}]{.mark}, [to approach society or
social institutions as if they were individuals. [To equate a]{.mark}
social [organisation with the individual]{.mark} mind [risks leaving out
the very valid social, historical, political forces that]{.mark} act on
organisations, create cultures and [induce or enable individuals to
collaborate]{.mark} unconsciously]{.underline}, [as well as consciously,
with each other]{.underline}.. ¶ I am thinking of the campaign started
by psychoanalysts [in the 1980s]{.underline}, [Psychoanalytic
Psychotherapists against Nuclear War]{.underline}
([[PPANW]{.underline}]{.mark}). Led by Hanna Segal's especial interest,
expressed in her paper 'Silence is the real crime' (Segal 1987), [the
individual defence mechanisms she suggested seemed to be simply
aggregated, and she [talked of regression during wartime]{.mark} from
depressive position to paranoid-schizoid functioning. The campaign
remained largely ineffective, so, it seemed [there were serious
limitations]{.mark}]{.underline} [to]{.underline} this kind of
individualistic political approach --[interpreting a supposed
unconscious as if it were an individual unconscious. **[The political
problem only disappeared with a political
solution]{.mark}**]{.underline} [-- the collapse of the cold war in
1990. I would suggest that **attributing individual dynamics to social
and political issues risks psychoanalysis becoming irrelevant to social
scientists and politicians.**]{.underline}

#### Psychoanalytic insights can only apply to the [single person]{.underline} being analyzed

Second, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[structural-[epistemological
problem]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[is]{.mark} that]{.underline}, if
psychoanalytic practice is not to be theoretically heavy-handed, then
[[psychoanalysts can]{.underline} **[only know what
individuals]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[within analysis [can
know]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and if]{.underline} [social relations are
reified]{.underline}, then [[there is a]{.underline} **[socially imposed
limit]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [insights]{.mark}
achieved [and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[future
prospects]{.underline}**]{.mark} [delivered [via
analysis]{.mark}.]{.underline} If social objectivity is dissimulated and
mystified, that is, [if the structures of our interdependence are
socially opaque]{.underline} and the forces organizing modern social
life are self-obscuring, [then this reification is bound to be
reproduced in the source material of analysis, that is, in the
analysand's self-experience]{.underline}. So, [when [the analyst]{.mark}
facilitates the analysand's freedom to experience]{.underline}, think,
feel, and ultimately commit [herself otherwise]{.underline}, **[[all he
really can do is help the analysand]{.underline}]{.mark}**, say,
[[commit]{.mark} herself [to forms of]{.mark} self- and world [relation
that appear]{.mark}]{.underline} less injurious or [[more
livable]{.underline} ***[to her]{.underline}***]{.mark}, [[but what
appears]{.underline}]{.mark} less injurious or [more viable
will]{.underline} in all likelihood [be limited to that
which]{.underline} ***[can appear so]{.underline}*** [from the
historically sedimented purview of a]{.underline} more or less
[bourgeois, self-interested, rights-bearing being]{.underline}. That is,
[what becomes available via [analysis is that which can become available
to the]{.mark} sociohistorically positioned
[analysand]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[not only is there]{.underline}
**[nothing psychoanalysis can do to get around this]{.underline}**,
[psychoanalysis is]{.underline} **[not even in a position to shed light
on the problem]{.underline}**]{.mark} without delving into social theory
and thereby abdicating its mandate to tarry with the problems and issues
that the analysand experiences as at the heart of her predicaments.
[[Analytic practice is]{.underline}]{.mark} caught **[[in a double
bind]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [[as it seeks the emancipation of the
analysand]{.underline}, [either it is]{.underline}]{.mark} forced to
become **[[politically didactic and]{.mark} consequently
[counterproductive]{.mark}]{.underline}** (or at least problematic qua
analysis), [[or it]{.underline} **[promotes]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[the [extremely limited forms of emancipation]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[imaginable by a]{.mark} typical [bourgeois
subject]{.mark}]{.underline}---and so it should be no surprise that,
from Freud onward, emancipation tends to be figured in terms of greater
capacities for love and work. \[Italics in original\]

intervention in potentially emancipatory terms, but the horizons and
aspirations have been substantially lowered from the universalist call
to radical academic policy advocacy, of the founders of emancipatory
approaches within security studies. [While the initial confident [calls
for emancipatory alternatives]{.mark} at least had an understanding of
the need for emancipatory agency,]{.underline} unfortunately found only
in Western powers and international institutions, [the later approaches
[lack]{.mark} this **[clarity]{.mark}** and confidence, [merely
suggesting]{.mark} that [more 'open']{.mark}, 'unscripted', 'locally
sensitive', ['desecuritised' and **less**]{.mark} **'universalist' and
['liberal' approaches]{.mark}** can avoid the 'resistances' held to come
from the local level. If [these approaches]{.mark} are 'emancipatory'
**they [lack any clear project]{.mark}** [or programme as to what these
claims]{.mark} might [mean]{.mark}]{.underline} [[or **how they might be

Towards a Security Framework for the Survival of Humanity,"

[Humanity's **capacity for self‐destruction**]{.underline} [poses a
**radically different problematique for security policy:**]{.underline}
[survival interdependence]{.underline} . [Survival interdependence means
that the survival of human societies on one side of the
world]{.underline} **[increasingly depends]{.underline}** [on the
(in)action of human societies on the other]{.underline}. For most of
history, human societies -- clans, tribes, city‐states, empires, and
nation states -- could seek security irrespective of the security of
other societies; but today **[no single nation state]{.underline}** [can
solve the biggest security problems of the times on their
own]{.underline}, **[nor]{.underline}** in many cases [can they hope to
escape their security consequences]{.underline}. [Humankind is becoming
ever more tied together as a **single 'security unit'**]{.underline}.
The forces behind this process are not political -- indeed,
international politics remains stubbornly committed to 'national
security' -- but material (Deudney, 2007, 2018), especially certain
human‐driven trends in technology and the environment that could
threaten humanity with destruction. Security policy must take into
account the significance of these changes. Thus, [a **new security
framework** is required]{.underline}.

**[['Existential security']{.underline}]{.mark}** [responds to a similar
set of questions as]{.underline} **[alternative security
frames]{.underline}** (see Table 2). **[Security for
whom?]{.underline}** [The **['referent object']{.mark}** of existential
security [is **humanity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Security]{.mark}
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [[about]{.mark} **[humanity's
survival]{.mark}**]{.underline} . **[Security for which
values?]{.underline}** [The 'values' to be secured are]{.underline}, at
the minimum, [the survival of humanity]{.underline} (i.e. [the
**biological entity** of the human species and **cultural entity** of
human civilization]{.underline}), and, at the maximum, the long‐term
prosperity of human civilization and the planet. [The security of
humankind ranges from the survival of existing human beings and
societies to past and future generations of humanity -- the **past whose
memory is recorded in history and preserved by the present**, and the
future whose possibilities of existence depend on actions taken in the
present]{.underline}. **[Existential security]{.underline}** therefore
[[adopts an **intergenerational perspective**]{.mark} of
security]{.underline}, **[[not only for utilitarian
reasons]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([e.g. quantifying the potential
gains/losses in 'future lives']{.underline}) (Baum, 2015; Bostrom, 2002,
2013; Torres, 2017), [but [also because **the significance of
humankind**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- that is, [all its **past
sufferings**, **present achievements**, and **future
potential**]{.underline} -- [[is at stake]{.underline}]{.mark}, [since
existential risks simultaneously threaten humanity's past, present, and
future]{.underline} (Morgenthau, 1961).

**[How much security?]{.underline}** [Nick Bostrom]{.underline} (2013,
p. 19) [proposes the principle of 'maxipok']{.underline}, [in which
security policy would seek to 'maximise the probability of an "OK
outcome"]{.underline}, [where an OK outcome is any outcome that avoids
existential catastrophe']{.underline}. [While reducing the probability
of existential risk to 'zero' may]{.underline} [be
impossible]{.underline}, [the amount of security should be determined by
a level of risk‐aversion equivalent to existential threats]{.underline}.
[Since thinking in terms of 'worst‐case scenarios' is a common practice
in the security domain]{.underline}, [and since some **['worst‐case
scenarios']{.mark}** could include civilizational collapse or human
extinction]{.underline}, [this]{.underline} [should imply a **strong
aversion to risk**]{.underline}. [Although there are logical limits to
the 'precautionary principle' with respect to existential
risks]{.underline},10 [it [has **practical**]{.mark}
**[implications]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for]{.underline}]{.mark}
security [[policy]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[such as
taking]{.underline}]{.mark} preventive, cost‐effective, and
**[[long‐term oriented action]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Clarke, 2005).
More generally, [[making]{.mark} (existential) [security a]{.mark}
[priority **does not**]{.mark} **imply the [sacrifice]{.mark} of all
[other values]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. political liberty, economic
wealth), **[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** it [[does
mean]{.underline}]{.mark} that [potential **[gains]{.mark} in other
values** [be weighed against]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[potential
losses]{.mark} in security]{.underline}**. [Security is always a
question of degree]{.underline} (Wolfers, 1952).

**[From what threats?]{.underline}** [Existential security is [concerned
with]{.mark} those [threats that have]{.mark} their [**origins in human
agency** and could bring about]{.mark} civilizational collapse or human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. This requires broadening the security
agenda beyond its conventional focus on 'security from violence', while
excluding 'natural' existential risks (e.g. asteroids and
supervolcanos). [There are two main reasons for emphasizing
anthropogenic threats]{.underline}. [The first is the low probability of
natural risks on **timescales relevant to humanity**]{.underline}
(Bostrom, 2013; Bostrom and Cirkovic, 2008;), [whereas anthropogenic
threats are, by definition, relevant to human timescales]{.underline},
[including the twenty‐first century]{.underline} (Rees, 2003). The
second is that many prevention/mitigation strategies for anthropogenic
existential threats act on their drivers in human agency, which makes
little sense for natural risks. [The spectrum of anthropogenic
existential threats includes threats to international peace and
security]{.underline} (**[[e.g. nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}**),
[dangers from human intervention in the natural environment]{.underline}
(**[e.g. [climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}**), [[and]{.mark} risks
from emerging technologies]{.underline} (**[e.g.
[AI]{.mark}]{.underline}**). [Existential security must take into
account the complex relationships between human, environmental, and
technological systems, as well as inherent uncertainties about
existential threat scenarios]{.underline} (e.g. 'nuclear winter',
'hothouse Earth', or 'superintelligence').

**[By what means and modes of protection?]{.underline}** [The
existential security frame requires innovation in the means and modes of
security policy]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline}
[because]{.underline} the **[conventional emphasis]{.underline}** [on
military capabilities and balancing is either inadequate]{.underline}
(e.g. nuclear war), [irrelevant]{.underline} (e.g. climate change), [or
counterproductive]{.underline} (e.g. AI). Moreover, the [pursuit of
**relative gains/losses** in security is fundamentally
misguided]{.underline} for anthropogenic existential threats, since --
as a general principle -- [either all human societies are safe, or none
of them are]{.underline}. Existential security requires a paradigm shift
from thinking about security policy as a matter of (national) 'defense'
to being a matter of (global) 'governance'. [Governance is **not an end
in itself**]{.underline} (e.g. the creation of a 'world state'),
**[but]{.underline}** [rather **a means to security**]{.underline} (i.e.
**[the survival of humankind]{.underline}**). [The pursuit of
existential security requires means of protection that involve a
comprehensive set of political, economic, and technological resources --
not merely military capabilities]{.underline}. The **[modes of
protection]{.underline}** [are primarily **'restraint'** and
**'resilience'**]{.underline}. Restraint is a prevention strategy, while
resilience is a mitigation strategy, which take on different forms for
different threats. [For the]{.underline} [nuclear threat]{.underline},
[restraint manifests itself in the policies of **disarmament**, **arms
control**, and nonproliferation]{.underline}, while resilience comes
mostly in the form of nuclear bunkers and shelters (Bull, 1961; Deudney,
2007). [For climate change]{.underline}, [restraint is]{.underline}
primarily [about limiting greenhouse gas emissions and the degradation
of carbon sinks, while resilience is about making societies less
vulnerable to heat stress, rising seas, food and water scarcities, new
diseases, and human migration]{.underline} (Wallace‐Wells, 2019; World
Bank, 2012). For AI, restraint entails the slow and careful development
of AI (Bostrom, 2014) -- or perhaps forgoing the 'AI dream' altogether
(Joy, 2000) -- while resilience is about reducing societal vulnerability
to technological disruption (e.g. cybersecurity). Importantly, the
growing survival interdependence of human societies implies that
restraint and resilience must be mutual to be effective. If only some
states choose disarmament or nonproliferation, if some societies reduce
carbon emissions while others increase them, or if one technology firm
decides to rapidly pursue 'superintelligence', then the (in)action of
some actors may affect the security of all humankind. This emphasis on
mutual restraint and resilience [**contrasts** with the **national
security frame\'s** emphasis on **'self‐help'**]{.underline}.

[With regard to ontological security, the distinction between security
and insecurity is]{.underline} the more **[critical]{.underline}** one.
[In a state of **ontological insecurity,**]{.underline} [the Self
experiences **instability**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[uncertainty of being]{.underline}**. [Ontological insecurity refers
to a]{.underline} [state of **disruption**]{.underline} [where the Self
has **lost its anchor**]{.underline} [for the definition of its
identity]{.underline} [and,]{.underline} consequently, [its ability to
sustain a narrative and answer questions about doing, acting, and being
(]{.underline}Kinnvall 2004). It may arise from deep uncertainty (Mitzen
2006a) and/or from the failure to have its sense of Self affirmed by
others (Zarakol 2010). [Conversely, in a state of ontological security,
the Self experiences a **stable**, **certain**, and **consistent**
social existence]{.underline}, [where it remains in control about its
identity and capacity for action]{.underline}. While I do not rule out
the possibility of a state of ontological asecurity, where the Self is
simply not concerned with the stability and certainty of its identity, I
do not explore this possibility and how it varies across different
states of physical security in this article.

Having identified different states of physical and ontological security,
I make the further assumption that [since **ontological** and
**physical** security]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
**[distinct]{.underline}**, [states of security do not vary
**uniformly** across the ontological and physical layers of
security.]{.underline} [One can be at a state of physical insecurity
while being at a state of ontological security, and vice
versa.]{.underline} Consequently, Table 1 charts out the four possible
states of security based on the conception of security as both
ontological and physical.

[The [state of **ontological
insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline}[/[physical
(in)security]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is]{.mark} one [where]{.mark} [the
Self experiences concern about]{.mark} **[physical
harm]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the
**[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and uncertainty [of its
**being**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Ontological insecurity **tempts
actors** to engage in practices that mark Others as not only
**different**]{.underline}, [but also as **morally
inferior**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[threatening]{.underline}**
(Campbell 1992). **[[Ontological]{.mark} insecurity [and physical
(in)security reproduce one another]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[As actors
**seek ontologica l security**]{.mark} [through **constructing Others
as**]{.mark} **[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to their
security-as-survival]{.underline}, [[they **mobilise**]{.mark} **their
[physical defences]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} the **[pursuit of
physical security]{.mark}**]{.underline} [through representing the
sources of threat as **different** and **morally
inferior.**]{.underline}

[Similarly, in a state of ontological security/physical (in)security,
actors experience stability and certainty of being in a relationship
where the Other is constructed as threat to their security-as-survival.
Consequently, they remain locked]{.underline} [into]{.underline}
**[conflict-producing routines]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[maintain their certainty of being]{.underline}** (Mitzen 2006a). In
protracted conflicts such as in Cyprus and Israel/Palestine, this state
of security sustains a stable Self/Other relationship based on enemy
roles. [When in such a state of security, minority and majority groups,
migrants and host societies perceive and represent each other's
identities as radically different and inherently incompatible, and
reproduce these perceptions and representations through acts of
securitisation]{.underline} [in order to **ensure their ontological
security**.]{.underline} The states of ontological insecurity/physical
(in)security and ontological security/physical (in)security are both
securitised states; however, whereas the former compels actors to
construct new narratives of difference and threat and engage in the
securitisation of new issues to regain their certainty and stability of
being, the latter compels actors to reproduce the existing narratives
and continue the securitisation of existing differences and conflicts to
maintain it.

[[The state of **ontological security**/**physical asecurity**
is]{.mark} certainly **the [most attractive]{.mark} state of
security**]{.underline} [from a **normative**]{.underline} [point of
view]{.underline}. [[**Security communities** in i]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations]{.underline}, and in particular, the European non-war
community (Wæver 1998) and the Nordic community (Browning and Joenniemi
2012) [[constitute the best examples]{.mark} of such a state of security
in international relations.]{.underline} [[A **collective identity
discourse**]{.underline} [makes it possible]{.underline} ]{.mark}[for
states in security communities [to maintain]{.mark} the [us/them]{.mark}
[distinctions]{.mark}, which are]{.underline}
[**[necessary]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the
**certainty** and **[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of
being]{.underline}]{.mark}, [while remaining in a state of **physical
asecurity** vis-à-vis one another]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006b; Browning
and Joenniemi 2012). [[In this state]{.mark} of security, **[conflicts
are sustainably resolved]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [issues that have
propelled conflict in the past are either **settled**]{.underline} [or
have **[shed]{.mark} their [physical
security-ness]{.mark},**]{.underline} [and are negotiated in normal
political channels]{.underline}. Yet, identity differences maintain
their ontological security-ness as groups reproduce their distinct
identities through various social and cultural practices.

[[Hybrid warfare]{.mark} [indicates]{.mark} a [**multitude** of]{.mark}
possible **[contingencies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[generating anxiety
about]{.mark} one's [ability to **remain oneself**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}and to continue to act. [It is thus [linked to "anxiety over
the **vulnerability of \[Western\] power**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Bell
2012, pp. 230--231), [threatening the West about losing its
particularistic **form of existence**]{.underline} (cf. Creppell 2011,
p. 455). Anxiety, in contrast to fear, which per Giddens (1991, p. 43)
constitutes a response to a specific threat, concerns "perceived threats
to the integrity of the security system of the individual" (Giddens
1991, pp. 44--45, cf. Browning and Joenniemi 2017, p. 38; Rumelili
2015). [[OS-seeking aims to **mitigate the effects** of such hard
uncertainty]{.mark}, **[bringing it within bearable
limits]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 346).
**[Routines]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
**[instrumental]{.underline}** [here, as they "**pacify the cognitive
environment**]{.underline} ... '**[inoculating' individuals against
paralytic, deep fear of chaos]{.underline}**" (Mitzen 2006, p. 347).

[[Being able to **survive**]{.mark} the ["hybrid threats" is]{.mark}
**directly [pertinent]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the [survival
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the EU and **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as
particular kinds of organisations, underpinned and **driven by specific
values**]{.underline} -- [which cannot be sacrificed or diluted in the
struggle for physical and institutional survival]{.underline}. [Yet,
hybrid warfare disturbs **the OS**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the EU
and [NATO]{.underline} in subtly distinct ways. Due to the
particularities of their institutional set-ups and historical
foundations, the OS drives of the two organisations are somewhat
distinctive. NATO's history is occasionally told through its surpassing
of a sequence of crises, albeit the end of the Cold War and the collapse
of its original enemy created a situation of unprecedented uncertainty
and ontological insecurity for the Alliance. Meanwhile, the EU's
ontological insecurity is a more recent phenomenon, stemming mostly from
the Eurocrisis and the looming possibility of a Grexit a few years ago;
the refugee/migration crisis in Europe of 2015 (Dingott Alkhoper 2018;
Mitzen 2018); the actual UK decision on Brexit in 2016 (Browning 2018);
and the rise of populist politics within the EU (Kinnvall, Manners,
Mitzen 2018) and the United States. [[NATO]{.mark} as a military
alliance [has been]{.mark} historically more [accustomed to]{.mark} the
othering [practices of **concrete geographical
places**]{.mark}]{.underline}, whereas the EU is generally regarded as
an organisation that has risen above geopolitical othering, juxtaposing
itself to Europe's dark past instead (Rumelili 2018, Subotic 2018, and
Della Sala 2018). Accordingly, the EU might be more at home with hybrid
threat management due to its historically broader conceptualisation of
security through the paradigm of intertwined risks rather than being
focused more strictly on "the threat, use and control of military force"
in the manner of a traditional defence alliance (Walt 1991, p. 212;
Manners 2002). Regardless of its perpetual transformer's self-image,
[[hybrid threats represent]{.mark} the uncomfortable "hard" or
"[**fundamental**" uncertainty for NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} (cf. Mitzen
2006, p. 346) [[and are]{.mark} thus [**ontologically disturbing** for
the security of **its self** as a **traditional alliance**]{.mark} [with
a **collective security pledge** bound to **"armed
attack"**]{.mark}]{.underline} [against one or more of its member
states]{.underline}.

[[In order to achieve OS, actors strive for **"routinizing**
]{.mark}**their [relations with]{.mark} significant
[others"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 342).
**[[Routines]{.underline}]{.mark}** [help to **[keep ontological fears
at bay]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [out of **everyday discursive
consciousness**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 348). From this
perspective, NATO's naming and shaming strategy vis-à-vis Russia as part
of its hybrid warfare countering strategy links the uncertainty
emanating from the hybrid nature of the new threats to the known and
routine relationship with its traditional antagonist.8 The
incapacitating [[difficulties related to **planning ahead**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [**anticipating** and]{.underline}
[**[countering]{.underline}** [hybrid engagements
are]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [somewhat
**[alleviated]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} latter's [attachment to a **known
rival**]{.underline}. [Russia's hybrid intervention in Ukraine has
concurrently provided NATO with the familiar parameters of the cognitive
"cocoon]{.underline}" (Giddens 1991, pp. 39--40) [which enables the
alliance to **reproduce its cognitively "knowable" world**]{.underline}.
A Mitzenian reading of NATO's emerging response to hybrid
threats/warfare thus points at the renewed routinisation of the
"programmed cognitive and behavioral responses" to Russia as the
alliance's original nemesis.

Restoring traditional vigilance vis-à-vis Russia, buttressing the
forward defence along the Alliance's eastern flank with the respective
military reinforcements, **[[contingency planning]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and exercises, [the emerging response of NATO to the hybrid menace could
also be read [as a]{.mark}n []{.mark}**attempted [restoration of a known
normative order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for the North Atlantic
Alliance]{.underline}. [Hybrid warfare endangers the basic features of
the said normative order]{.underline} (or that of the broadly conceived
Western security community in general, including the EU as well) as its
efficient countering would likely compromise the underlying principles
for this order's particularistic existence (cf. Creppell 2011, p. 450).
As a threat of subversion, [hybrid warfare exposes the internal
vulnerabilities in the body of the traditional security alliance
(NATO)]{.underline} and a self-proclaimed post-modern security actor
(i.e. the EU; cf. Cooper 2004). This concerns, in particular, the
ever-elusive (and contested) balance between national/organisational
security and individual liberties (cf. Waldron 2003, Neocleous 2007), as
strategic communication is inherently at odds with free speech as a core
value of Western liberalism. Countering hybrid warfare is conducive of
generating a security predicament of perpetual pre-emption which, by
definition, would indicate pre-emptive gathering of all sorts of data,
thus likely infringing on the privacy of the individuals for the sake of
the organisational/regional/national security. This precautionary logic
resonates with the risk society approach which characterises the
struggling with a sheer volume of risks with potentially fundamental
consequences as a key feature of modernity, implying that "decisions are
... made not in context of certainty, nor even of available knowledge,
but of doubt, premonition, foreboding, challenge, mistrust, fear, and
anxiety" (Ewald 2002, p. 294).

Critical Situations and Ontological Insecurity

The [issue of critical situations which produce ontological insecurity
of collective actors has been a neglected topic in the literature on OST
in IR.]{.underline} So far, only a few authors have reflected on the
role of critical situations in ontological security processes in world
politics. Drawing on Giddens, Brent Steele for example argues that
[[critical situations are]{.mark} unpredictable [events
that]{.mark}]{.underline} affect a large number of individuals,
[**[catch state]{.mark} [agents off-guard]{.mark}** [and
**disrupt**]{.mark} **their [self-identities]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Steele 2008: 12). [It is **irrelevant**]{.underline}, in his view,
[whether or not a]{.underline} **[researcher]{.underline}**
**[decides]{.underline}** [if an event constitutes a critical
situation]{.underline}; [[what matters is whether]{.mark}
**[policymakers]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[interpret them as
such]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Critical situations are
therefore]{.underline} not objective facts but [social constructions
produced in the very process of interpretation]{.underline} (ibid.).
Dimitry Chernobrov has a similar understanding of international crises
as unpredictable set of events that create great uncertainty and which
states often (mis)recognise because they rely on narcissistic
self-conceptions (Chernobrov 2016).

While I fully concur that critical situations are radical and socially
constructed disruptions that put self-identities to the test, they seem
to be more than that. In fact, such conceptualisation of a critical
situation is so wide and elastic that most crises in world politics, if
not all, can easily fit into this definition. For example, it could be
argued that every terrorist attack is usually unpredictable, affects a
large number of individuals, catches a state off-guard and disrupts
self-identity narratives. And yet, if any crisis can be treated by
analysts as a critical situation, the concept of ontological
(in)security loses analytical sharpness and an important part of its
value to IR theory. As a result of this conceptual underdevelopment, we
currently have few conceptual tools in IR to identify and analyse
critical situations and the conceptual distinction between ontological
security and ontological insecurity remains elusive.

This book fills this gap by proposing a conceptual framework to study
ontological insecurity and critical situations. By drawing on the work
of Anthony Giddens, I [[define]{.mark} [**ontological security**
in]{.mark}]{.underline} [[world politics as
**possession**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [on the level of the unconscious
and practical consciousness]{.underline}, [[of answers to]{.mark} four
[fundamental questions]{.mark}]{.underline} [that all polities in some
way need to address.]{.underline} These questions are [[related to
existence]{.mark}; finitude; relations and auto-biography]{.underline}.
[Collective [actors become ontologically]{.mark} [insecure when critical
situations rupture their routines]{.mark}, thus [bringing]{.mark}
**[fundamental questions]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the **level of discursive
[consciousness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Their inability to **'bracket
out' fundamental questions** [produces **anxiety** and a **loss of
agency.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

What does it mean to be ontologically secure? According to Giddens, 'To
be ontologically secure is to possess, on the level of the unconscious
and practical consciousness, answers to fundamental existential
questions which all human life in some way addresses'. These fundamental
existential questions relate to existence and being, finitude and human
life, the experience of others and the continuity of self-identity
(Giddens 1991: 47). As he noted, 'To live our lives we normally take for
granted issues which, as centuries of philosophical enquiry have found,
wither away under the sceptical gaze' (Giddens 1991: 37). In other
words, in order to be ontologically secure, agents have to be able to
'bracket out' these fundamental questions through routines of daily
life, thus building trust into the constancy of their social and
material environment and fending off existential anxieties. If unable to
put aside these existential trepidations related to death, transience of
life and the continuity of the self and others, individuals simply
cannot 'go on' with their daily life. [Ontological insecurity, on the
other hand, is a result of critical situations, circumstances of radical
and unpredictable [disjuncture]{.mark} 'that **[threaten]{.mark}** or
**destroy** the certitudes of **[institutionalised
routines']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Giddens 1984: 62). Critical situations
remove the protective cocoon created by routines and move fundamental
questions, previously taken for granted, into the realm of discursive
consciousness. The result is the 'flooding through' of shame and guilt
from the unconscious mind (ibid.: 57). [The sudden inability of agents
to 'go on' by relying on the unspoken know-how unleashes an upsurge of
anxiety expressed in regressive modes of behaviour followed by attempts
to **re-establish routines** and **regain cognitive
control**]{.underline} [over the changed environment]{.underline}
(ibid.: 64). In these 'faithful moments' as Bahar Rumelili calls them,
'anxieties can no longer be controlled' and 'ontological security comes
under immediate strain' (Rumelili 2015b: 11).

The distinction between discursive consciousness, practical
consciousness and unconsciousness is of paramount importance here
(Giddens 1984: 41--45). Discursive consciousness is the ability of
actors to verbally express their actions. Practical consciousness,
crucial for the maintenance of ontological security, is tacit knowledge
about how to 'go on' without a need to express it discursively. Between
practical and discursive consciousness there is a free flow of
information. When asked to give discursive expression of something that
is based on background knowledge, such as driving a car or practising
table manners for example, agents are more or less able to do it but
they do not need much knowledge to carry out a competent performance.
Finally, unconsciousness includes cognitions that are 'either wholly
repressed from consciousness or appear in consciousness only in
distorted form' (ibid.: 5). Unlike practical and discursive
consciousness, the unconscious mind is therefore separated from the
previous two with a bar of repression.

The starting point of this book is that [critical situations can also
affect **collective agents.**]{.underline} However, in contrast to
individual experience of anxiety that does not have to be expressed
discursively, I posit that when collective actors are concerned, anxiety
outbursts are performed through a public discourse on fundamental
questions. Several studies on ontological security in IR have made a
passing reference to this feature of ontological security as the ability
to 'bracket out' fundamental questions in order to 'go on' with daily
unfolding of international life (Kinnvall 2004: 759; Krolikowski 2008:
111; Steele 2008: 51). However, none of these studies have delved deeper
into what these questions were, their relationship with critical
situations and how all this could be translated into the field of world
politics. In the rest of this section, I intend to bridge this gap. The
first fundamental question is related to 'existence and being' that,
according to Giddens, is about an 'ontological framework of external
reality' (Giddens 1991: 48). This awareness 'of being against non-being'
lies at the core of human freedom that generates anxiety. Giddens writes
that answers to this fundamental question (like all others) are lodged
at the level of practical consciousness. In pre-modern contexts, it was
tradition that provided answers to this existential question and creates
a sense of firmness of the world. In the context of high modernity,
individuals can try to rely on tradition but this will not provide them
with safe ground. Consequently, they have to continuously reflexively
reorder their activities in light of new information.2

This book posits that [[collective actors]{.mark} in world
politics]{.underline} also [need to have **trust** in]{.underline} [the
**continuity** of their **external environment**]{.underline}. [The

**[traditions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[institutions]{.underline}**, [offers one such ontological framework
for states]{.underline} (Bull 1977). [[To be **ontologically

importance of home and dwelling to freedom from anxiety and ontological
insecurity has been well documented in psychology and social
theory]{.underline} (Dupuis and Thorns 1998; Padgett 2007). For
individuals, home [provides 'a site of **constancy**]{.underline} [in
the social and material environment']{.underline} (Kinnvall 2004: 747).
For polities, feeling at home in international society [provides a

[Bracketing out the fundamental questions is accomplished through
routinisation]{.underline} [of]{.underline} what the English School
calls the primary institutions of international society. Here I have in
mind '[deep and relatively durable social practices']{.underline} [[such

law]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that]{.underline} **[define legitimate

**durability** of]{.underline} [the secondary institutions of
international society, such as **[security
regimes]{.mark}**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[international
organisations]{.underline}**, [[can]{.mark} also **[inoculate states

Berenskoetter and Giegerich, '[because they enable states to gain (and
sustain) **ontological security**]{.underline} [[by negotiating a
**shared sense of international order**]{.mark} with
friends']{.underline} (Berenskoetter and Giegerich 2010: 410). Taking
part in these durable practices of international society [provides
constancy and thus helps **contain**]{.underline}---although falling
short of fully overcoming---[the **chaos** that is **lurking below the

claimed, intersubjective pressures and stigmata exerted in the past by
the 'civilised' society of states become with time an integral part of

Tragedy is largely absent from the existing normative debate on
securitization. Instead, the [[debate has]{.underline}]{.mark} become
[[organized around whether securitization]{.mark} [is]{.mark} a
[**"negative"** or **"positive"**]{.mark} concept]{.underline}. In the
classic formulation, the Copenhagen School points to how "\[n\]ational
security should not be idealized. It works to silence opposition and has
given power-holders many opportunities to exploit 'threats' for domestic
purposes" (Buzan et al. 1998, 29; Williams 2003). [Securitization has
negative effects when it functions as "a political technology that
consistently favors the interests of the powerful and enables violence
and exclusion"]{.underline} (McDonald 2015, 154). Correspondingly, Wæver
admits a "'bias' for desecuritization" or de-escalation, although he
quickly notes that this is "not always better than securitization"
(Wæver 2011, 469). **[At the same time]{.underline}**, a number of
approaches point to cases where **[securitization]{.underline}** [is
ethically desirable]{.underline}. In her compelling consequentialist
argument, for example, Floyd asks "whether the consequences of, and the
gains from, the securitization are preferable relative to the
consequences and gains from a politicization" (2007, 338). Relatedly,
Roe contends that "[[the extent to which securitization
necessitates]{.mark} a **[lack of]{.mark} openness and
[deliberation]{.mark}** [has been **overexaggerated**]{.mark}" and
suggests it may even elicit unappreciated forms of
cooperation]{.underline} (2012, 250).

[[The]{.mark} problem with the **negative/positive [debate]{.mark}** is
that it appears to [impose **moral certitude** where there]{.mark} often
[is none]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Registering securitizing moves as
clearly positive or negative can be difficult because their effects can
be mixed and temporally distant]{.underline}. The difficulty in making
this determination may also be an indicator of the uncertainty
surrounding securitizing moves. [In the end, [because]{.mark} the
[outcomes of security claims are]{.mark} **[uncertain]{.mark}**, [we
cannot know]{.mark} in advance [whether they will lead to positive or
negative consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline} Instead, [we should
entertain a distinctly tragic vision of securitization that
council]{.underline}s [an ethic of **self-limitation**]{.underline}. The
core of this tragic vision is a recognition that the powerful allure of
using security talk to "gain control" over a situation will always be
present (Wæver 1995, 54). However, we should also recognize that this
control is always illusory because it presumes all of its effects can be
predetermined. The tragedy of securitization is that the failure to
recognize how contingency imposes limits on action lures political
actors into a false sense of certainty and the conviction that they can
determine the future. This leads to a hubristic adoption of "misplaced
certainty," such as when Vice President Dick Cheney declared in August
of 2002 that "there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of
mass destruction" (quoted in Mitzen and Schweller 2011, 3). A similar
situation emerged when Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld subsequently
claimed in November that the Iraq conflict could be "\[f\]ive days or
five weeks or five months, but it certainly isn't going to last any
longer than that" (Esterbrook 2002). A similarly misplaced certainty is
evident in US General Stanley McChrystal's assurances to the Obama
administration in 2009 that a surge in troops and resources were
critical to stave off American defeat in Afghanistan (Woodward 2009).
More recently, it is visible in President Donald Trump's 2018 assertion
that he was "100 percent right" on the weaknesses of the Iran nuclear
deal (CNN 2018).

Yet, tragedy cuts both ways. **[[Blanket
opposition]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to **securitizing
moves**]{.underline}]{.mark} can also [have unanticipated
effects]{.underline}. Ironically, the [desecuritization of an issue [may
not]{.mark} just [result in]{.mark} its
**[repoliticization]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} its
**[[disappearance from public view]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Floyd 2010,
57--58). [Viewing security discourse as negative also underplays how the
[**management of threats** can serve as a **focal point** for
**democratic cooperation** among different]{.mark} political
[actors]{.mark}]{.underline} (Roe 2012, 250, 257--58). The point is not
that every security discourse and the practices it justifies has
catastrophically perverse consequences. Instead, the goal is to
highlight a sensible restraint over the limits of seeing into the
future, how this shapes choice, and the dangers of hubris that follow.
[[When]{.underline}]{.mark} properly **[[adapted]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} this **[[constructivist
context]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the tragic vision of **[[securitization
can]{.mark} be an important tool in [cultivat]{.mark}ing prudence and
[restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}** (cf. Lebow 2003, 364).

The problem with this tragic vision is that it points to
[[processes]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[are
**never**]{.underline}]{.mark} entirely [[in our
possession]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Whether [in]{.mark} the form of
**[background knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Pouliot 2008),
**[[habits]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Hopf 2010), **[[or
routines]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Mitzen 2006), much of **[[social life
occurs without conscious deliberation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
reflection. These forms of unthinking action impair reflexivity and
limit actors' ability to see how the world might be different and thus
how outcomes can be uncertain. In some cases, this can be benign, such
as the unreflexive amity between Canada and the United States that
allows these countries to "escape" from the traditional security dilemma
(Collins 2014, 572--73). But just as practices of amity can be habitual,
so too can enmity. [The hawkish US senator may designate Iran's nuclear
program as threatening because that is what hawkish US senators do, and
there is no perceived way to be hawkish otherwise]{.underline}. The
result is that the uncertainty surrounding securitizing moves becomes
concealed under an unthinking veil of common sense. The tragedy of
securitization then is not only that political figures often exceed
their limitations by ignoring how contingency can derail securitizing
moves---it is that these limitations often never even register

This means overcoming the tragedy of securitization require a certain
degree self-reflexivity. This is similar to what Booth and Wheeler
describe as the "security dilemma sensibility," or an actor's ability
and willingness to reflect upon their actions, including one's own role
in provoking insecurity in others (2008, 7). By sensitizing leaders to
how uncertainty is an endemic feature of political life, and how their
actions can be interpreted in unintended ways, security competition can
be mitigated, at least in part (Booth and Wheeler 2008, 265). Yet, these
moments of self-awareness and [**[reflection]{.underline}** [are
difficult]{.underline}]{.mark} precisely [[because]{.mark} there are
powerful forces that demand simplicity and closure: namely our desire
for a stable sense of self or what is widely referred to as
**ontological security**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006). [Reflecting on the
[uncertainty]{.mark} of international politics [can erode **one's sense
of identity and agency**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [ultimately [leading to
a]{.mark} "deep, **[incapacitating state]{.mark} of not knowing how to
get by in the world**"]{.underline} (Mitzen and Schweller 2011, 29).
Booth and Wheeler's security dilemma sensibility may have the laudable
goal of alerting leaders to the role of uncertainty in political life,
but this confronts the problem that many would prefer that it remain
hidden.

The consequence is that this tragic aspect of the securitization dilemma
takes on an intractable character. Either unwilling or unable to "know
one's limits," as Herz would say (1950, 179), the role of uncertainty
becomes hidden and security claims appear as a reliable strategy for
control and influence. Like the classic realist dilemma, the
securitization dilemma is pervasive because it is often invisible. The
compelling need for a logic of selflimitation---of a careful and
reflective use of security language and how it can be derailed by
contingency--- is obscured because of an aversion to
recognizinguncertainty. It is this specter of a need for reflection and
restraint that may not be realized, I suggest, which demands that we
rethink the role of the analyst in provoking reflexivity among
power-holders.

Conclusion: Rethinking the Role of the Analyst

Motivated by the absence of unintended and perverse consequences in
constructivist theorizing of security, this article has pursued a
reconceptualization of the security dilemma. Viewing the dilemma as a
logic of limitation shaped by choice, uncertainty, and tragedy, the
argument focuses on transposing this logic to the constructivist context
of securitization theory. By showing how the choice to engage in the
social construction of threats is complicated by uncertainty and the
tragic failure to recognize one's own limits, the dilemma analytic helps
us to understand how securitization can be both a potent instrument for
mobilization, as well as a volatile source of unpredictability.
Moreover, this conceptual lens lays the foundation for an ethical
imperative of self-limitation among securitizing actors---albeit one
made difficult given the desire for simplicity and closure. Far from a
rebuke of constructivist theorizing, the argument shows that taking the
social character of security seriously means appreciating how political
claims are always vulnerable to being derailed by different types of
contingency.

This reconstructive move has important implications for studying the
social construction of security. First, while the initial influence of
realism on securitization theory is well-documented (Floyd 2010; Gad and
Peterson 2011), few attempts have been made to show how engaging with
these realist roots can yield new insights.22 Here, the reconstruction
of the security dilemma demonstrates how [returning to realist themes
can yield a fresh insights]{.underline}. Second, the argument pushes
scholars studying securitization to expand their universe of outcomes
beyond the reductive binary of success and failure and to consider cases
of perverse and unintended consequences. Not only are these outcomes
relatively common, they undercut the prevailing image of securitization
as a reliable technology of control. Third, the securitization dilemma
shows why uncertainty is more of an enduring problem for social action
than constructivists typically acknowledge. Contra earlier arguments
where learning and socialization effectively mitigate the problem of
uncertainty (Wendt 2006, 208--9), this perspective stresses how
contingency means that social acts like securitizing moves can have
unpredictable effects.

The most important result of this reconstruction, however, may be in how
taking the tragic element of the dilemma seriously reorders the
political role of the analyst. [[Rather than
assessing]{.underline}]{.mark} the validity of **[[a particular security
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[or exposing its socially
constructed nature]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[this
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark} asks the analyst to
[[provoke]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[reflexivity]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[on behalf of power-holders over the risks associated with
securitization]{.underline}. While this entails a bias toward
deescalation and desecuritization, unlike other approaches this is [[not
achieved through]{.underline}]{.mark} overt references to
[[an]{.underline}]{.mark}y liberal, democratic, or **[[emancipatory
ideal]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Instead]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[it
is packaged for power-holders as a strategy of
self-preservation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here, the analyst presents the
move to securitize as a risk-laden and potentially self-defeating
strategy. The analyst points to a series of precedents showing how such
a strategy can produce perverse consequences: how today\'s tough talk
can become tomorrow\'s liability; how audiences can interpret
threatening messages in unexpected ways; and how today\'s framing of
security can lead to perverse consequences tomorrow. By foregrounding
the problem of uncertainty, the analyst works to accentuate and impress
upon actors the dilemmatic quality of securitizing moves.

Yet, the problem with presenting the move to securitize as a risk is
that it may become accepted. Ironically, framing an escalation in enmity
as possible but dangerous is precisely what may legitimize such a move
in the eyes of risk-insensitive actors. This is Huysmans' (2002) now
familiar normative dilemma of writing security. The indeterminacy of
language means that political actors may interpret advice in
unpredictable ways. Frustratingly, this may include the precise opposite
of the analyst\'s intention. This situation is likely inescapable, but
it may be mitigated. What I suggest is that analysts should strive to
cultivate a deeper subjectivity of risk sensitivity, comparable to Booth
and Wheeler\'s security-dilemma sensibility, among political actors.

Key to this argument is how visions of the future satisfy the human
desire for certainty. As Berenskoetter argues, "visions depicting the
self in an imagined future order serve as anxiety controlling
mechanisms" (2011, 654). Visions of the future inoculate actors against
the anxiety of uncertainty by providing a narrative of where they are
going and how to get there. Indeed, normative debates on securitization
are already loaded with such visions. The impulse to securitize is
underpinned by a utopian future where the security frame can finally
mobilize a response to an otherwise intractable problem. Conversely, the
impulse to desecuritize is sustained by a dystopian future defined by
unrestrained authoritarian politics. A tragic vision of the future does
something different: it presents a future where the only thing we can
know decisively is that it is indeterminate and attempts to conclusively
control it are vulnerable to failure. The very recognition of
fundamental limits on human freedom (Steele 2007, 281--82) becomes
transformed into a source of ontological security. This tempers the
human need for cognitive closure by reconfiguring it into what Herz
understood as a "fundamentally humble posture toward the value and
precariousness of life" (Sylvest 2008, 442). **[[An actor with a]{.mark}
greater [sensitivity to indeterminacy may still pursue securitizing
moves, but with a cautious awareness that they are]{.mark} volatile acts
[best pursued sparingly]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[The analyst]{.mark}
does not simply educate political leaders by pointing to the
indeterminacy of the world; she seeks to [make]{.mark} political
[subjects]{.mark} more [sensitive]{.mark} toward it **[by crafting
visions of a precarious future]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Finally, this tragic vision cannot, and should not, escape its own need
for reflexivity. Its scholarly proponents need to engage in their own
process of self-reflection, focusing on how their knowledge and
interests are themselves historically situated. The ethic of restraint
is a value, and not necessarily the value for all historical
circumstances. A recognition of the social construction of security
"facts" must be sobered by a recognition of the social construction of
security "values" (Hamati-Ataya 2012, 685).
