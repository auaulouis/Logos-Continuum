#### Russian hybrid tactics threatens the unity and credibility of the alliance

In 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain made it possible for
Adolf Hitler to march into Czechoslovakia despite the overwhelming
military superiority of Prague's Western allies because Chamberlain had
decided the issue was "a quarrel in a faraway country, between people of
whom we know nothing." Today, **[[it is]{.mark}]{.underline}** similarly
[[**difficult to believe that NATO would go to war** over]{.mark} its
far-flung commitments in [Eastern Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Nevertheless]{.underline}, on March 27, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
Western [[alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} [admitted North Macedonia as
its]{.underline} newest---and
[weakest]{.underline}---[member]{.underline}. In so doing, [it [has
given]{.mark}]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [[Putin a]{.mark}
terrific [opportunity to]{.mark} expand his influence]{.underline},
further [**[erode NATO's unity]{.underline}**, **[and test the bloc's
commitment]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to defend a member of the
alliance.]{.underline}

[[North Macedonia]{.mark} is the definition of a weak link and easy
pickings]{.underline} for an adversary. A landlocked country of 2
million inhabitants, it has weak political institutions and only a short
history of independence. As of 2018, it spent only 1 percent of its
GDP on defense---short of the 2 percent NATO guideline---and had
just 8,000 active-duty soldiers. [There is simmering communal tension
between a Slavic Orthodox majority and a sizable ethnic
Albanian]{.underline}, [mainly]{.underline} [Muslim]{.underline}
[minority]{.underline}, **[making it vulnerable to
interference]{.underline}**. Within NATO, [only]{.underline} neighboring
[Albania has a]{.underline} lower per capita GDP and a [higher level
of corruption]{.underline}. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy
Index ranks North Macedonia as having Europe's least developed political
culture.Russia has held massive war games that were only thinly
disguised simulations of attacks on NATO members such as Poland and the
Baltic States.

Moscow has viewed NATO's expansion in Eastern Europe with suspicion
since the 1990s. Yet it wasn't until the 2000s, after Russia's military
and economy rebounded from the chaos of the post-Soviet era, that Putin
declared NATO's eastward expansion a "direct threat" and openly
confronted the alliance. [Russia's invasion of
[Georgia]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2008---not coincidentally, the year
that NATO declared an interest in Georgia's eventual accession to the
alliance---[stopped the bloc's expansion]{.underline} into former
Soviet-controlled areas in its tracks. [Putin's]{.underline} 2014
invasion of Ukraine and subsequent [annexation of
[Crimea]{.mark}]{.underline}, while not a direct assault on a NATO
member, further **[[demonstrated Western
impotence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the face of Russian aggression.
Further north, Russia has held massive war games that military experts
say were thinly disguised simulations of attacks on NATO members such as
Poland and the Baltic States.

Now that North Macedonia has joined NATO, [[Putin appears to]{.mark} be
relishing his]{.underline} first [chance to [prove that **the alliance
is** ]{.mark}**little more than [a paper tiger]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In 2018, Russia's ambassador to North Macedonia declared the country a
"legitimate target" if tensions between NATO and Russia were to
increase. But there was no "if" about it: Even before North Macedonia
became a member, [Russia had]{.underline} already [been working
assiduously to ratchet up tensions in the region]{.underline}. [Moscow
has]{.underline} shipped S-400 anti-aircraft missiles to neighboring
Serbia for joint Russian-Serbian military drills[, facilitated an
attempted coup]{.underline} in Montenegro, and tried to destabilize
Bosnia and Herzegovina by [stoking sectarian tensions]{.underline}. And
in North Macedonia itself, [Russia has funded **troll
factories**]{.underline} [that]{.underline}, among other things, [were
used to]{.underline} target the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign with
**[disinformation]{.underline}**. Moscow also tried to influence North
Macedonia's September 2018 referendum on NATO membership, is using its
embassy and consulates there as bases
for [intelligence-gathering ope]{.underline}rations, [and has spread
propaganda]{.underline} detailing alleged Western plots to break up the
country.

That Russia would threaten NATO's members in Eastern Europe is nothing
new, of course. Russia has long attempted to undermine the Baltic
countries---Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia---which joined NATO and the
European Union after gaining their independence from the Soviet Union.
But today, the Baltic States are well integrated into alliance
structures and the European economy and are home to thousands of NATO
troops. Whereas the Baltics have become part of NATO's well-armored
front, the Balkans are its soft underbelly.

Whereas the Baltics have become part of NATO's well-armored front, the
Balkans are its soft underbelly.

 [NATO's posture]{.underline} in North Macedonia and its neighborhood
[is very limited.]{.underline} The Balkan countries are also poorer,
more ethnically divided, and less economically integrated with Europe.
[Their potential instability]{.underline} and the much lower likelihood
of a robust response by the West [make]{.underline} North Macedonia and
its neighbors ripe and **[easy targets for Russian
meddling.]{.underline}**

Taking a page from history's playbook, Putin rightly assumes that most
decision-makers in NATO capitals would consider North Macedonia a
"faraway country" of "people of whom we know nothing." U.S. President
Donald Trump, whose relationship with Putin continues to attract
attention, confirmed a similar suspicion with regard to neighboring
Montenegro when he appeared to question NATO's commitment to defend the
Balkan nation during an interview aired on Fox News. And while some may
have taken offense at Trump's statement, the truth is he speaks for
many.

According to a February poll by the Pew Research Center, [less than
half]{.underline} the populations of [France, Spain, Turkey, and Greece
hold a favorable view of NATO.]{.underline} Pandering to the alliance's
critics, French President Emmanuel [Macron]{.underline} last
year [declared that NATO had "brain death."]{.underline} The citizens of
[only three European countries]{.underline}---Britain, the Netherlands,
and Lithuania---[say their country should respond with military force if
Russia were to attack a NATO member in Eastern Europe.]{.underline}

No surprise then that **[[NATO's posture]{.underline}]{.mark}** toward
its newest member **[[remains unclear]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Though
[NATO broadened]{.mark}]{.underline} the definition of its joint defense
commitment---**[[Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the alliance's
charter---**[[to include cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** in 2014,
**[[it has failed to clarify]{.mark} just [what that
means]{.mark}.]{.underline}** When asked what level of cyberattack on
one of its members would trigger a response, NATO Secretary-General Jens
[Stoltenberg said]{.underline} only, "[We will see]{.underline}."
[The]{.underline} 2018 [Brussels Declaration reaffirmed NATO's
intent]{.underline} to defend member states from nonconventional
attacks---**[but only meekly asserted that in "cases of hybrid
warfare]{.underline}**, [the Council could decide to invoke Article
5.]{.underline}" **[These Western weasel words]{.underline}** will
**[have been duly noted in the Kremlin]{.underline}**.

These Western weasel words will have been duly noted in the Kremlin.

[The type of meddling Russia]{.underline} has specialized in
[includes]{.underline} **[[election interference]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[**[inflaming ethnic tensions]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[provoking violent
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [These]{.underline} three [real
possibilities [could trigger a NATO response]{.mark} under Article
5.]{.underline} [The most pressing issue is]{.underline} securing [North
Macedonia's upcoming elections]{.underline}, now postponed until further
notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Polls last showed VMRO-DPMNE,
a pro-Russian nationalist party, in a dead heat with
the pro-Western Social Democrats. Russian interference in the election
process or outcome not only threatens Macedonian sovereignty but, if
successful, could result in a government that tilts North Macedonia
toward Moscow.

[Russia may also seek to pressure and destabilize]{.underline} North
Macedonia in other ways, including through Moscow's regional client,
Serbia. [Russian propaganda]{.underline} aimed at North Macedonia
[includes conspiracy theories about the]{.underline} country's sizable
Albanian [minority supposedly colluding with NATO]{.underline} and
Albania to fold North Macedonia into a "greater Albania" amid great
bloodshed. As any student of Balkan history knows, [such rhetoric has
led to ethnic violence in the region before]{.underline}. Alternatively,
[Russia may stoke simmering conflicts]{.underline} in Serbia, whose
unstable Presevo region directly borders North Macedonia, or the
unresolved Kosovo dispute. Either conflict could easily spill into North
Macedonia.

NATO's next steps to secure its new member could include adapting the
successful tactics used when Montenegro joined the alliance in 2017. A
NATO-sponsored cyberteam provided the Montenegrin government with
technical support to learn to identify and counter hybrid warfare. NATO
raised awareness of the benefits of NATO membership by working with
officials, civil society, local governments, and media organizations. It
also worked to improve governance in Montenegro's defense sector.
Similarly, the European Union, which has just opened accession talks
with North Macedonia, could move quickly to signal to the world that the
Balkan nations are an integral part of Europe.

More broadly, however, NATO needs a mechanism to respond to Russian
aggression in the event that the alliance's members can't unanimously
agree to do so. **[[Article 5 requires unanimity]{.underline}]{.mark}**
before invoking collective defense, **[[but NATO's members
differ]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in their attitudes to
Russia.]{.underline}

Article 5 requires unanimity before invoking collective defense, but
NATO's members differ in their attitudes to Russia.

 One solution would be to form, as a backstop in case it is needed, a
coalition of the willing comprising NATO members with credible defense
capabilities that are willing to confront Russia and prepare a
collective response to any attack.

Despite NATO's overall military superiority, it has a weak hand in the
Balkans, and Russia continues to outmaneuver it there. NATO must quickly
signal that it remains steadfast and, having decided to admit it, that
North Macedonia is an integral member of the alliance. **[[If NATO fails
in its support of new members]{.underline}]{.mark}** like North
Macedonia, [the chances have just risen that [it will be met with
Russian]{.mark} [aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}---[hybrid]{.underline}
or conventional---**[[that may]{.mark} just mean the [end]{.mark} of
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[as a **credible
alliance**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### The Chinese hybrid crisis makes the link inevitable

Lindsey W. **Ford and** James **Goldgeier 21**, David M. Rubenstein
Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center for East Asia Policy Studies, Robert
Bosch Senior Visiting Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center on the United
States and Europe, 1/25/21, Retooling America's alliances to manage the
China challenge,
https://www.brookings.edu/research/retooling-americas-alliances-to-manage-the-china-challenge/#cancel

Edited ableist language

[China has]{.underline} now [been added to the alliance's]{.underline}
**[ever-expanding agenda]{.underline}**, providing a surprising point of
agreement in an otherwise contentious December 2019 NATO summit, at
which NATO members committed the alliance for the first time to deal
with China's "growing influence and international policies." In April
2020, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg charged an independent
"Reflection Group" with preparing a report eyeing the future; released
in November, the "NATO 2030" document put the challenge in stark terms:
"China is... best understood as a full-spectrum systemic rival, rather
than a purely economic player or an only Asia-focused security actor."

**[Obvious [questions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[remain]{.underline}
[about the]{.underline}]{.mark} [precise [role NATO should play]{.mark}
vis-à-vis China]{.underline}. There are certainly a host of global
security concerns --- ranging from China's presence in Africa and South
Asia to its influence in space and cyberspace --- where NATO
coordination would be valuable. It is unclear, however, what role NATO
could, or would, play in an Asian military crisis with Beijing. [NATO
allies have limited]{.underline} military [capabilities]{.underline}
they could bring to bear in the Pacific, and [**[few European
partners]{.underline}** [would be eager to be pulled into a
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} in places like Taiwan or the South China
Sea. [[Given]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[Article
V]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the 1949 Washington Treaty refers to "an
armed attack against one or more \[NATO members\] in Europe or North
America," a Pacific conflict, even involving U.S. forces, would
technically fall outside NATO's scope. But in [a spiralling
crisis]{.underline} that [would implicate Europe's strategic and
economic interests]{.underline}, could NATO afford to remain on the
sidelines? At a minimum, Europe could play a valuable role in the
political, economic, or even cyberspace arenas. As European allies seek
a bigger role in the Indo-Pacific, **[[the U.S. needs]{.mark} to engage
them in [more frank discussions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [about these
types of scenarios]{.underline}, [**[creating clearer
expectations]{.underline}** [about how]{.underline}]{.mark} different
[[parties might **respond** **before**]{.mark}]{.underline} any such
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} appears on the horizon, **[[rather than
after]{.mark} one has erupted]{.underline}**.

Beyond the question of NATO's role in Asia, there are also tradeoffs
associated with European partners seeking a more prominent role in the
Indo-Pacific. Encouraging more regular European military deployments to
the Indo-Pacific, while they would be welcomed in Asia, could detract
from NATO's focus on Eastern Europe to deter Russian aggression or in
the Middle East to engage in counterterrorism missions. These are areas
where Europeans will need to shoulder more of the burden in the coming
years as the U.S. continues to rebalance its foreign policy to Asia.

Do the United States and its allies have the right operational
capabilities to address a new type of threat?

Whereas NATO has always aspired to multilateral operational
effectiveness, America's Asian alliances lack NATO-like structures to
generate closer interoperability, particularly in a multilateral
context. Despite the closeness of the U.S.-Japan alliance --- a
relationship that officials refer to as the "cornerstone" of Asian
security, the relationship lacks the integrated command and control
structures that NATO enjoys. In fact, the U.S.-South Korea alliance is
the only one of America's Asian treaty alliances that has such
a mechanism. Beyond command and control, America's Indo-Pacific
alliances in some cases lack the types of integrated planning mechanisms
that NATO has in place, constraining the ability of allies to better
align doctrine and force structure with the United States.

These challenges stretch across the operational realm. NATO's
intelligence directorate and fusion center facilitates real-time
information sharing among the 30 member states. Indo-Pacific countries
have struggled to build similar multilateral information-sharing
capabilities even at the unclassified level. Meanwhile, key Indo-Pacific
allies such as Japan and South Korea remain outside of arrangements such
as the Five Eyes, through which the U.S. shares its most sensitive
intelligence with close allies. And while the U.S. and its Indo-Pacific
allies engage in frequent bilateral exercises with each other, they are
only just beginning to experiment with the types of realistic,
multinational training exercises that will be needed to deal with
Chinese military aggression.

In addition to enhancing their operational effectiveness, the U.S. and
its allies are contending with the question of how to tackle **[[Chinese
security threats]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[are]{.mark}
often]{.underline}** [unconventional and
**[non-kinetic]{.mark}**]{.underline} in nature. As Tom Wright has
eloquently argued, [[China is more focused on]{.mark} competing with
"**[all measures short of war]{.mark}**]{.underline}["
[than]{.underline}]{.mark} [it is on initiating [a]{.mark} major
[conventional conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This reality will **force
U.S. alliances to adapt**]{.underline} [to a new set of requirements
that stretch far beyond]{.underline} the task of [conventional military
deterrence for which these relationships were designed]{.underline}. In
Asia, **[[the U.S. and its allies are wrestling]{.underline}]{.mark}**
with how best to address maritime aggression that involves not only the
People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), but also a vast armed fishing
fleet that operates under military control. In the economic realm, they
are struggling to devise coordinated responses that will deter, or at
least blunt the impact of, China's use of boycotts and embargos to
achieve its security aims. And [in]{.underline} outer space and
**[cyberspace]{.underline}**, U.S. [[alliances will have to
devise]{.mark} **coordinated [responses]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to
contend with]{.mark} Chinese]{.underline} offensive [[capabilities that
could]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~blind~~
\[**[[block]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] **[U.S.
[satellites]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~cripple~~
\[**[[damage]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] banking systems and **[power
[grids]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Addressing these problems will require
new]{.underline} types of combined **[planning]{.underline}**, new
bureaucratic structures, and a more expansive operational toolkit.

**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, too, [[will need **to
adapt**]{.underline} [to address]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the]{.underline}
**[[non-kinetic]{.underline}]{.mark}** [nature of]{.underline}
**[China's]{.underline}** [security]{.underline}
**[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To serve effectively as a forum for
a trans-Atlantic response, NATO needs to more fully consider the impact
of China's investments in Europe on alliance interoperability.
Technological lags among European allies over the past three decades
have decreased their abilities to work seamlessly with the U.S. in a
military operation, and Chinese investments in Europe
could exacerbate the problem by putting the security of
telecommunications infrastructure at risk.

#### Eliminating unsustainable and unenforceable alliance commitments doesn't signal unreliability

Brad L. **LeVeck and** Neil **Narang 16**, associate professor of
political science at the University of California Merced, associate
professor in the Department of Political Science and director of the
Security Hub at the University of California Santa Barbara 2016, How
International Reputation Matters: Revisiting Alliance Violations in
Context,
https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/bleveck/assets/pdfs/how_international_reputation_matters.pdf

In this context, a particularly good indicator of future alliance
behavior may be past behavior. If a state violated its agreements in the
past, it seems intuitive that it may be more likely to do so in the
future. [However]{.underline}, Spence (1973) famously showed that [[past
behavior is not always]{.mark} equally [informative]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that whether [past behavior]{.underline}
distinguishes one type from another **[[depends]{.underline}]{.mark}**
crucially [**[on the behavior's cost]{.underline}**.
**[If]{.underline}**]{.mark}, for instance, **[[honoring an alliance
becomes]{.mark} so [difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}
all **[states are forced to violate their commitments]{.underline}**
together, **[[then a violation conveys little information about how
reliable one state is]{.underline}]{.mark}** relative to another. Beyond
this extreme example, [the general insight is that [alliance
violations]{.mark}]{.underline} do more to [[signal that a state
is]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively [[unreliable
when]{.underline}]{.mark} many **[other [states appear to
be]{.mark}]{.underline}** willing and **[[able to honor the same
agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Of course, whether other states would
honor a particular agreement under similar conditions is often difficult
to observe (Narang 2014; Narang and Mehta 2015), as each alliance has
elements that are somewhat unique. However, there may be times and
regions where system-level shocks cause a large number of countries to
simultaneously violate alliance commitments together. This may provide
relatively clear evidence to a potential partner that the costs of
honoring a previous alliance were so great that even reliable states
that would normally honor their commitment were unable to do so.
[This]{.underline} discussion [has important implications
for]{.underline} empirically [studying how violating an alliance affects
a state's reputation]{.underline}. It is likely that the cost of
maintaining an alliance varies significantly by region and time and that
one can identify shocks across these dimensions. Figure 1, which plots
the percentage of states violating their bilateral security alliance in
each region and year based on Leeds et al. (2009), supports this
supposition.

[[Sharing **offensive cyber capabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark} [raises

have all sorts of problems]{.underline} for deterrence: signaling is
difficult, they can be perceived as a cheap threat, and their effects
are largely uncertain. By contrast, moving new military forces in
Eastern Europe or conducting ground exercises are credible signals of
extended deterrence, but are costly and time consuming. [[Cyber
capabilities]{.mark} aren't free, nor are they necessarily cheap, but

#### No spillover

Brad **Stapleton 16**, Former visiting fellow in defense and foreign
policy at the Cato Institute and former adjunct researcher at the RAND
Corporation, \"Trump and NATO---Redefining the US Role," CATO, 11/11/16
https://www.cato.org/blog/trump-nato-redefining-us-role

[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[argue]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} although Article V does not legally obligate
the United States to deploy military forces in defense of its NATO
allies, such a response would be essential to preserve American
credibility. In other words, [[if the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[failed to defend]{.underline}]{.mark}
its [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} allies against Russian aggression,
[[all]{.mark} of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tate[s' [other
allies]{.mark}]{.underline} around the globe
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} begin to **[[doubt whether they
could]{.underline}]{.mark}** really **[[depend upon the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.
[[Yet]{.mark} U.S. **[credibility would only suffer if Washington were
to maintain an expectation of]{.mark}**]{.underline} U.S.
[[**intervention** and]{.mark} **subsequently [failed to fulfill
that]{.mark} expectation**]{.underline}.

[If the]{.underline} incoming [[Trump]{.mark} administration is serious
about **reducing its commitment to NATO**, its first priority
[should]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [[be to **eliminate** the
**expectation** that the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[would **automatically intervene**
]{.mark}**militarily** [in defense of]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} allies. For **[that expectation is the root
of the inequitable distribution of the defense burden]{.underline}**
within NATO. [Why should]{.underline} the [Europe]{.underline}an allies
[invest significantly]{.underline} in defense [if they can count on the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates to guarantee their security?
[Rather than maintaining an **implicit commitment** to spearhead any
defense of NATO]{.underline} territory (particularly in Eastern Europe),
the [Trump]{.underline} administration [could make it clear]{.underline}
to the allies [that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will
serve as a **balancer of last resort**]{.underline} in Europe. In other
words, the [Europe]{.underline}an allies [will bear primary
responsibility for]{.underline} the [defense]{.underline} of Europe;
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will only intervene in
**dire circumstances** if they are **unable to defend
themselves**]{.underline} (much like during the two world wars).

### Assurance DA\-\--AT: Baltics

#### Deterrence fails in the inevitable hybrid crisis in the Baltics

Illimar **Ploom 18**, Estonian National Defence College, and Viljar
Veebel Baltic Defence College, Nov. 2018, The Deterrence Credibility of
NATO and the Readiness of the Baltic States to Employ the Deterrence
Instruments, Lithuanian Annual Strategic Review, Vol. 16, Is. 1 p.
195-198

The preceding analysis demonstrates **[the weaknesses of the Alliance's
deterrence]{.underline}** strategy. The overall idea of nuclear
capabilities as a supreme guarantee of NATO's credible deterrence does
not help to scale down Russia's regional ambitions. This is due to both
morality arguments as well as practical reasons, such as territorial
proximity of Russia and the Baltic counties, difference in opinions and
priorities within the Alliance, potential for the escalation of conflict
aspects, etc. Russia is justifiably considered to have conventional
supremacy in the Baltic region. The conventional balance in the Baltic
area is not achievable either for the Baltic countries in total nor with
the FPF battalions, and [the [defense models of the Baltic]{.mark}
countries are]{.underline}, by their nature, fully
[nonaggressive]{.underline}, **[[without]{.underline}]{.mark}** any
**[[room for]{.underline}]{.mark}** pre-emptive initiatives, extra
territoriality, or **[[hybrid tools]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What is
more, a[s far as the Baltic countries are concerned,]{.underline} some
[signs of "self-deterrence" are]{.underline} also [visible]{.underline},
referring to unsubstantiated, if not somewhat naïve, views of the
political and military elite of the Baltic countries, as well as relying
on so-called deterrence by imagination. [[The credibility of deterrence
is at risk]{.underline}]{.mark}, depending on different visions of the
Alliance's member states about what should be the values, the focus and
the threat perceptions of the organisation, whether Russia should be
treated as a potential adversary, or a somewhat vague response of the
Alliance to Russia's political rhetoric. Similarly, the ethnic component
-- a relatively big Russian-speaking community, particularly in Estonia
and Latvia -- speaks mostly in favour of Russia in a potential regional
conflict. It must be acknowledged that this could, to some extent, also
have a deterring effect. Last but not least, as [Russia is not suffering
from a feeling of stigmatisation and reciprocity]{.underline}, the
Alliance lacks tools that would have an entangling or disciplining
effect. To answer the question of what should be done in the future to
actually deter Russia and to avoid aggression from the Russian side, the
essence of the potential conflict should first be discussed. It is
argued by this paper that **[[the more precise the aim
against]{.underline}]{.mark}** whom, **[[what, and
when]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[deterrence is needed, the more
cost-efficient]{.mark} the [deterrence is]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Russia's past strategy against the Baltic countries can be judged as
having been definitely well-thought]{.underline}, [covering
most]{.underline} of the [escape routes]{.underline} for potential
"victims". First, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has used the approach
based on the Gerasimov doctrine which [[attempts to find a
**hybrid**]{.mark} **conflict [model]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with a
**very low-intensity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Among other things,
**[[that would devalue the Alliance's credibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and allow an increase in Russia's negative "bargaining
power"]{.underline} in the international arena [by occupying part of the
opponent's territory]{.underline}. Since [[the costs]{.mark} of this
type of confrontation [are low]{.mark}]{.underline},
[**[Russia's]{.mark}** destabilising **[attempts will]{.mark}** most
probably **[continue]{.mark}**]{.underline}, i.e., at least as long as
NATO will decide not to "punish" Russia. Second, [Russia is]{.underline}
simultaneously [determined to respond to any regional initiatives of the
Alliance]{.underline} with its own respective activities and
interventions [which have]{.underline} already [led to a regional arms
race]{.underline}. The reason why something like this has happened is
the fact that [[Russia is]{.mark} strongly [prioritizing national and
emotional categories]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[whereas]{.underline} **[the
current]{.underline}**]{.mark} [overall **[costs for the Alliance are
low]{.mark} enough,**]{.underline} giving no reason to worry yet. Also,
[even if the West contradicts the logic of the sphere of
interests]{.underline}, **[the Baltic states]{.underline}**, being
situated in such proximity to Russia, **[are]{.underline}** de facto
**[considered as a zone where Russia]{.underline}** [needs to be allowed
to]{.underline} **[retain high conventional advantage]{.underline}**.
Thus, [any]{.underline} additional [conventional defence]{.underline}
measure applied on the Eastern flank of NATO [could trigger an
out-of-proportion arms-race or escalation from Russia]{.underline}.
[[This dynamic **is bound to work in Russia's
favour**]{.underline}]{.mark}, also in terms of providing ever more
justification for its worries and possibly a pre-emptive attack. Based
on the past experience of Georgia and Ukraine, as well as Russia's past
strategy against the Baltic countries, one hypothetical scenario why,
when, and how would Russia attack the Baltic countries could be
constructed. The most likely political aim of the potential aggression
against the Baltic countries would be to restore control over the
territory of the former Soviet Union, or at least to break off their
relations with the Western countries. According to this logic,
**[most]{.underline}** of the [**[energy will be invested into]{.mark}**
delegitimizing]{.underline} of local national [political authorities by
using]{.underline} the tools of **[[hybrid
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Ultimately, **[[this would lead to a
situation where]{.underline}]{.mark}**, disappointedly,
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** forces of the **[[Alliance will]{.mark}
decide [to leave the Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [[Russia's
aim]{.mark}]{.underline} during such a takeover in the Baltic region
[would most likely be to maintain as many physical assets and
legitimization as possible. This means it [will]{.mark} need to [avoid
aggressive military activities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Also, since the
[Russian-speaking communities]{.underline} in Estonia and Latvia [are
relatively large]{.underline}, [the takeover will]{.underline} have to
[take place without destroying much]{.underline} of the [local
infrastructure]{.underline}. However, the initiation of protests of
"local women and children" against the "imperialists", including NATO,
is highly likely. This draws on Russia's previous strategies used in
Ukraine in 2014 and in Estonia in 2007. With a "little help" from
Russia, this should not be too difficult, considering the public opinion
of the local Russian-speaking community, at least in Estonia and Latvia.
And, by the same token, the falling out of the Russian-speaking
population will be exacerbated by the suspicious attitude towards the
latter still prevalent among the Estonian and Latvian speaking
communities. Here, the most effective deterrence key would be building a
coherent and mutually respectful society. This presumes dealing
rationally and systematically with the demographic outcomes of the
occupation. Alas, the difficulty is the animosity from the different
ethnic sides in these two countries. Returning to the hypothetical
scenario, in recent years the Kremlin has tried its best to keep up the
ill-feelings among the Baltic people and minorities. Due to the
relatively messy political and social situations, the key element of
Russia's strategy is focussed on the Baltic countries not even being
able to recognise the beginning of the attack. This means that the
latter will omit the opportunity to mobilize, both as far as the Baltic
countries or the Alliance is concerned. [Should the]{.underline} Baltic
countries/[Alliance]{.underline} still decide to [mobilise]{.underline}
themselves, [Russia would describe it as an example of the opponent's
aggressive behaviour]{.underline}, [as well as a justification to
interfere with the aim to]{.underline} [protect the "peaceful local
people".]{.underline}

#### Hybrid threats are the most pressing issue to allies\-\--clarifying Article 5 alleviates abandonment fears

[**[Hybrid threats]{.mark}** and warfare represent one of **[the most
pressing]{.mark} security [issues]{.mark}**]{.underline} in contemporary
world politics. Seldom noticed and appreciated, [the
**[unravelling]{.mark} of [the international order]{.mark}**
[may]{.mark} slowly [come]{.mark} about [through]{.mark} repeated
[**hybrid blows** to **US**]{.mark} military **[cred]{.mark}**ibility
a[nd its **alliance system**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [the
unconventional nature of coercion, and the **[confusion]{.mark}** and
ambiguity central to hybrid warfare have [kindled **fears of
abandonment**]{.mark} by security partners. Because such operations fall
short of a direct and conventional "armed attack" by one state against
another, the stipulated condition for self-defence and retaliation,
**[allies]{.mark}** may **[fear]{.mark}** that in such circumstances
security **[commitments will not be upheld.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Japan, for instance, was uncomfortable with the Obama administration's
weak-kneed response to China's steady encroachment in the South and East
China Seas, which began with China's seizure of the Scarborough Shoal in
2012. In 2015, Abe eventually secured a redefinition of the guidelines
governing the US-Japan security alliance to deter China in so-called
"grey zone" scenarios also through intelligence sharing, deeper
coordination and bilateral planning.\[7\] Somewhat [similar dynamics and
reassurances have been at play among NATO partners following Russia's
encroachment in Ukraine, but fears of abandonment persist.]{.underline}

[[Concerns of]{.mark} potential [entrapments]{.mark}, or slippery slopes
towards a full-blown military entanglement due to US security
commitments, combined with the very nature of hybrid/grey-zone
scenarios, is likely to **[cloud US decision-making]{.mark}** in such
instances. This will potentially **[slow retaliatory measures]{.mark}**
and circumstantial political factors will have more weight than ever on
such decisions. For these reasons, [Russian]{.mark}]{.underline} and
Chinese [[activities are]{.mark} currently [at the **centre of NATO

#### 'Cred' theory is nonsense.

Hopkins University, BA from William & Mary, International Reporter and
Columnist for The New York Times, Former Reporter for Vox, "The
Credibility Trap", Vox, 4/29/2016,
https://www.vox.com/2016/4/29/11431808/credibility-foreign-policy-war

If you have experienced even a few minutes of cable news coverage or
handful of newspaper op-eds on American foreign policy, [there is a
word]{.underline} [you will have encountered over and over again:
**credibility**]{.underline}.

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, according to this
theory, [has to]{.underline} follow through on every threat and
[confront every adversary]{.underline} in order [to maintain America\'s
global credibility. [If it fails]{.mark} to stand up to challengers [in
**one place**]{.mark}, then they will rise up **everywhere**, and
America will see its **[global standing]{.mark}**, and thus its power in
the world, [crumble]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This argument has dominated Washington especially in the three years
since President Barack Obama declined to bomb Syrian leader Bashar
al-Assad as punishment for using chemical weapons. Proponents of
\"credibility\" say this matters for more than just Syria.

American [[allies]{.mark} came to **distrust** and **[drift]{.mark}
away**]{.underline} from US leadership, they argued. And American
adversaries grew emboldened --- including Russia\'s Vladimir Putin,
whose subsequent invasion of Ukraine was said to be a direct result of
weakened American credibility.

\"Putin believes Obama does not have the intestinal fortitude to stand
up to him in Ukraine. He thinks Obama will talk tough and then look for
a way out --- just like he did with Assad,\" wrote Washington Post
columnist Marc Thiessen.

\"Syria has become the graveyard of U.S. credibility,\" columnist
Michael Gerson wrote in the same paper.

This theory is not exclusive to overheated op-eds. It is pervasive,
almost to the point of consensus, in much of Washington\'s foreign
policy community, including among many policy-makers --- and has been
that way longer than perhaps even proponents realize.

In 1950, as the United States considered whether or not to intervene in
the Korean War, a CIA report urged the US to intervene so as to uphold
its credibility far away in Europe:

A failure to draw the line would have seriously discredited the whole US
policy of containment, gravely handicapping US efforts to maintain
alliances and build political influence with the Western European powers
and with other nations closely aligned with the US.

Secretary of State Dean Acheson agreed, fearing that European leaders
would be in a \"near-panic, as they watched to see whether the United
States would act.\" If the US did not invade Korea, Acheson worried,
Europe\'s frail post-war order could be at risk.

And this is not just an American belief. As former National Security
Council official Philip Gordon recounted recently, France kept fighting
in Algeria, long after the costly war appeared lost, partly out of fear
of losing credibility.

\"The credibility issue---if you pull out of Algeria, boy, you lose
face, right? And so the argument was, stay in and keep a lid on it,\"
Gordon told the Atlantic\'s Jeffrey Goldberg.

But [[there is a **problem** with this theory]{.mark} of credibility:
**It does [not]{.mark} appear to be [real]{.mark}**[. **Political
scientists**]{.mark} have **[investigated]{.mark}** this theory [**over
and over**, and]{.mark} have **[repeatedly disprove]{.mark}**n
[it]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Yet the belief in credibility persists, dominating America\'s foreign
policy debate, steering the United States toward military action abroad
in pursuit of a strategic asset --- the credibility of America\'s
reputation --- that turns out not to exist.

How did this idea become so entrenched in Washington, and [why does it
persist despite being **repeatedly debunked**?]{.underline} What does it
mean to have so many of America\'s foreign policy discussions turn
around an idea that is demonstrably false --- and what can this tell us
about how and why America intervenes abroad?

The credibility myth

When Americans talk about \"credibility\" in foreign policy, what they
are usually describing is something that political scientists instead
call reputational or reputation-based credibility.

In political science, \"credibility\" usually refers to specific
promises or threats, and in this case the research does say that
credibility is real. For example, if the US pledges to defend South
Korea from a North Korean invasion, then it matters that the US convince
both Koreas that this pledge is credible, for example by stationing US
troops in South Korea.

\"REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS CAN DRIVE STATES INTO WARS OVER TRIVIAL
INTERESTS IN PERIPHERAL PLACES\"

That is the formal definition of credibility in foreign policy, it\'s
real, and it matters. But when \"credibility\" is used colloquially, it
typically refers to a very different kind of credibility, one based
entirely in a country\'s or leader\'s reputation from its actions in
other disputes or conflicts. (This article uses the colloquial
definition of credibility, except where noted otherwise.)

Under this line of thinking, if the US fails to follow through on a
threat or stand up to a challenger in one part of the world, then its
allies and enemies globally will be more likely to conclude that all
American threats are empty, and that America can be pushed around. If
the US backed down once, it will back down again.

It\'s easy to see how people could be attracted to [this
idea]{.underline}, which [puts complicated geo-politics in
**simple**]{.underline} and familiar **[human terms]{.underline}**. It
encourages us to think of states as just like people.

But [[states are **not people**]{.mark}, and this theory, for all its
appealing **simplicity**, is **not correct**. [There is **no
ev**]{.mark}idence that America\'s [allies]{.mark}]{.underline} or
enemies [[change]{.mark} their [behavior based on]{.mark} conclusions
about America\'s **[reputation]{.mark}** for credibility, or that such a
form of reputation **even exists** in foreign policy]{.underline}.

[\"Do leaders assume that other leaders who have been irresolute in the
past will be irresolute in the future and that, therefore, their threats
are not credible?\"]{.underline} the University of Washington\'s
Jonathan Mercer wrote, in introducing his research on this question.

[\"**No**; **[broad]{.mark} and [deep ev]{.mark}idence
[dispels]{.mark}** that notion,\"]{.underline} Mercer concluded. [\"As
[the **record shows**, **rep**]{.mark}**utation[s do not
matter]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline}

[A]{.underline} 1984 Yale University [study]{.underline}, for example,
[examined **dozens of cases**]{.underline} from 1900 to 1980 to look for
signs that, if a country stood down in one confrontation, it would face
more challengers elsewhere. [The answer was **no**:
\"deterrence]{.underline} success [is not systematically associated ...
with]{.underline} the defender\'s firmness or lack of it in [previous
crises]{.underline}.\"

**[Historians]{.underline}** have also [looked at specific
incidents]{.underline} where the US thought its credibility was on the
line [and determined that we were simply **mistaken**]{.underline}.

Acheson\'s warning that the US had to invade Korea to reassure its
European allies, for example, turned out to be wrong: British and French
officials in fact worried the Americans were going to pull them into a
far-away war.

During the Vietnam War, American officials could see that they were
losing, but for years worried that withdrawing would communicate
weakness to the Soviet Union, emboldening Moscow to test American
commitments elsewhere. Even if Vietnam was lost, American credibility
had to be defended.

As historian Ted Hopf has shown, the Americans could not have had it
more wrong: Soviet leaders never reached any such conclusion, and in
fact were puzzled as to why the US sacrificed so many lives for a war
that was clearly lost.

If that\'s not enough evidence for you, try considering reputational
credibility from the opposite point of view, and it starts to look more
obviously ridiculous. Dartmouth\'s Daryl Press once pointed out to my
colleague Dylan Matthews that Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev
repeatedly threatened to eject the American-led forces occupying West
Berlin, but he backed down. The US didn\'t consider him one iota less
\"credible\" for this, and during the following year\'s Cuban Missile
Crisis took his threats very seriously.

The idea of reputational credibility has also been debunked in the most
well-known recent case: the notion that America\'s failure to bomb Syria
in 2013 emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Proponents of reputational credibility took Putin\'s 2014 Ukraine
invasions as vindication. Surely Putin only invaded because America had
damaged its credibility in Syria, they argued. In their view, it showed
why it is so crucial for the US to maintain its reputational credibility
by never backing down from military interventions.

Julia Ioffe recently investigated this theory for the Atlantic, asking
foreign policy officials and experts in Moscow whether there was merit
to it. She seemed to reach the same conclusion as have many Russia
analysts: that Putin invaded Ukraine for reasons specific to Ukraine.
America\'s supposed reputation loss in Syria appeared to play no role.
Some of Ioffe\'s sources seemed to not even understand the argument of
how Syria and Ukraine would connect.

The credibility trap

You will notice something these incidents have in common. In every case,
a belief in \"credibility\" pulls the United States toward fighting a
war for the wrong reasons, or toward staying in a war longer than is
worthwhile.

This mistaken belief has repeatedly helped to drive American military
action abroad, Dartmouth\'s Jennifer Lind demonstrates in a new article
in International Security Studies Forum.

\"Indeed, from Korea, to Vietnam, to Bosnia, to Libya, to President
Barack Obama's \'red line' in Syria, debates about U.S. intervention are
thick with admonitions that 'Our Credibility Is On The Line,\'\" Lind
writes.

\"CREDIBILITY HAS MIGRATED FROM FOREIGN POLICY INTO THE CONSTITUTIONAL
LAW OF WAR POWERS\"

The logic of reputational credibility can only ever lead to the same
conclusion: toward the use of American military force abroad, even in
cases where there is no clear reason to intervene and where the
downsides of intervention would seem to outweigh the upsides. It is a
compass that only points in one direction.

In this theory, the use of force is inherently good, regardless of how
or where the bombs fall, because it strengthens American leadership
globally. And an absence of American military action is almost always
bad, because it is said to invite new problems and greater threats.

\"Every time analysts and leaders call for war, they warn that inaction
will jeopardize America's credibility,\" Lind and Press, her husband,
have previously written in Foreign Policy.

Alarmingly, despite the mounting evidence against reputation theory, it
continues to drive US foreign policy discourse --- and has recently even
been integrated into the formal legal basis of American foreign policy.

\"Credibility has migrated from foreign policy into the constitutional
law of war powers,\" Vanderbilt\'s Ganesh Sitaraman found in a 2014
Harvard Law Review article:

In a series of opinions, including on Somalia (1992), Haiti (2004), and
Libya (2011), the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has
argued that the credibility of the United Nations Security Council is a
\"national interest\" that can justify presidential authority to use
military force without prior congressional authorization.

The 2011 case is particularly striking, given that it occurred under
President Obama, who has personally denounced reputational credibility
as \"so easily disposed of that I'm always puzzled by how people make
the argument.\"

Yet reputation theory is so prevalent in American thinking that even a
president who specifically opposes that theory --- and is himself a
constitutional lawyer --- has allowed it to be formally integrating into
his government\'s legal case for war.

Are America\'s allies to blame? Or are we?

If reputational credibility has been so repeatedly debunked, both in
specific instances and as a theory, why does it continue to loom so
large in America\'s foreign policy discourse?

Tufts University\'s Michael Beckley hinted at one possible explanation
in a much-discussed article last year in International Security: Could
it have something to do with America\'s uniquely broad network of
alliances?

Beckley\'s article was actually asking a different question --- whether
those alliances lead the US to war, by allowing allies to \"entangle\"
it in foreign conflict. (Beckley concludes the answer is no; other
scholars have disputed his findings.)

But, in reviewing so-called \"entanglement theory,\" Beckley points out
that reputational credibility, even if it doesn\'t exist in the world,
is something that definitely exists in the minds of foreign leaders and
foreign policy decision-makers.

\"The alliance comes to be perceived as an end in itself, transcending
the more concrete national security interests for which it was initially
conceived,\" political scientist Jack Levy wrote in a well-known 1981
paper (which Beckley cites). Here\'s the key quote:

Political decision makers come to believe that support for one\'s
allies, regardless of its consequences, is essential for their national
prestige, and that the failure to provide support would ultimately
result in their diplomatic isolation in a hostile and threatening world.

So it\'s not that reputation is a real thing that compels states to act
in a certain way, but rather that individual decision-makers are driven
by their own mistaken belief in reputation. As a result, Beckley writes,
\"reputational concerns can drive states into wars over trivial
interests in peripheral places.\"

Some scholars, including Levy, argue that America\'s allies promote the
idea of reputation, as a means to convince the United States to commit
more resources to serve their own interests.

Foreign leaders do seem to become awfully preoccupied with American
credibility when they want the US to take military action on their
behalf. When the US failed to bomb Syria in 2013, for example, Syria\'s
enemies in the region --- Arab leaders who are also allied with the US
--- declared that American credibility was at stake.

\"I think I believe in American power more than Obama does,\" Jordan\'s
King Abdullah II said of Obama\'s decision to not bomb Syria.

This comes at a time when the US has grown unusually indulgent of its
allies, as Jeremy Shapiro and Richard Sokolsky argue in a recent
article. This has made American policymakers more likely to heed
allies\' demands and take their claims at face value.

\"THE CREDIBILITY ARGUMENT IS SIMPLY AN EASY (AND HARD TO DISPROVE) WAY
FOR ELITES TO SELL THE FOREIGN POLICY THEY\'RE MOST INTERESTED IN TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE\"

But Dartmouth\'s Jennifer Lind finds evidence that allies make this
argument only opportunistically, and almost always about conflicts in
which they are directly involved. They might speak in the language of
reputation theory, but their behavior suggests that they do not really
believe in it.

Reputation theory, after all, says that America\'s allies would want the
US to intervene as much as possible in other conflicts, when in fact the
opposite is usually true.

In fact, so-called [**[rep]{.mark}**utation [is actually]{.mark} driven
**almost [entirely]{.mark}** by **[internal]{.mark}** American dynamics.
Consider **[America\'s belief]{.mark}** that [it had to intervene in
**Korea** to reassure]{.mark} European [allies, who]{.mark} in fact
[wanted **no**]{.mark} **such [thing]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Lind makes this point well by citing America\'s pledge to defend Taiwan
from a possible Chinese invasion. According to reputation theory, Asian
leaders who also fear Chinese aggression would want the US to make and
uphold this pledge. American policymakers indeed believe this, and it is
one reason (albeit far from the only reason) why the US has pledged to
fight in such a war.

\"[Many]{.underline} U.S. leaders and foreign policy elites [today argue
that, in the event of a war in]{.underline} the [Taiwan]{.underline}
strait, the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [must
defend Taiwan or see its credibility collapse]{.underline},\" Lind
writes.

[[In reality]{.mark}, the **[opposite]{.mark} is true**. American
[allies]{.mark} in Asia]{.underline}, Lind writes, \"[[make it
**clear**]{.mark} that [they under **no circumstances** want]{.mark}
[war]{.mark} in the Taiwan strait, and fear that the Americans will
someday fight one with China.\"]{.underline}

The Taiwan example is instructive, if alarming: America\'s foreign
policy community believes something that is flatly untrue. And while a
Sino-American war over Taiwan is extremely unlikely, it looked
substantially less unlikely in the 1990s. It is concerning that American
policymakers were committing the US to fight such a war in part because
they believed something that was 180-degrees the opposite of reality.

The point is not just that America\'s mistaken belief in credibility is
dangerous, but also that [it [does **not** come from **allies**. It
comes from **us**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### No link\-\--alliance cred doesn't spill over broadly because states view reliability through [their stakes and interests]{.underline} in each issue 

Iain D. **Henry 20**, Lecturer at the Strategic and Defence Studies
Centre, Australian National University, Spring 2020, "What Allies Want:
Reconsidering Loyalty, Reliability, and Alliance Interdependence,"
International Security, Vol. 44, No. 4, p. 45-83

Third, the reliability idea allows for alliance commitments to be
interdependent, but in a broader sense than usually expected. Mercer
defines interdependence as "using past behavior to predict or explain
future behavior," and interdependence is often examined in terms of
iterative crises: the state backed down in the first crisis, so it is
expected to back down in a second crisis.40 Interdependence could also
operate on a much quicker schedule, however, in nonconflict situations,
and with reference to revelations of interests rather than character.
[If a state observes something indicating allied unreliability, then it
should try to mitigate this risk. A state fearing abandonment could
increase its defense budget]{.underline}, seek new allies, peacefully
settle old scores, [or **discuss these fears with the
ally**]{.underline}. A state fearing entrapment could employ distancing
strategies, threaten to withhold support, launch peace initiatives, or
even abrogate the alliance. [Alternatively, [because the state is not
judging character]{.mark}, interdependence could be weak: [if a state
has **no real stake in an issue**, and its ally's actions will not
affect reliability]{.mark}, then [the state may not care how its ally
behaves]{.mark}]{.underline}.41

Importantly, this concept of interdependence allows for the ally's
actions to be important now, not just in future crises. Considering how
interdependence operates simultaneously across discrete alliance
commitments allows for the idea of reliability to be tested within a
single crisis. Further, it is more representative of the real world: a
state might not need to worry significantly about an adversary's resolve
until the next crisis, but Brett Ashley Leeds finds that when
"conditions change, \[alliance\] violation becomes more likely."42 Thus,
I expect states to be sensitive to variations in their ally's
reliability.

However, [[because reliability is contingent upon interests---not
character judgments]{.mark}---the [**effects of alliance interdependence
might not be as severe** as those predicted]{.mark} by other theories.
[If states do not assess character]{.mark}, then
[an]{.mark}]{.underline} \[End Page 55\] [**[ally's unreliability on one
particular issue will not result in the ally being unreliable on all
matters]{.mark}**. A [U.S.]{.mark} backdown and [withdrawal in one
region **may not damage**]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [[**reliability in
another**: it may]{.mark}, instead, [improve it]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Alternatively, the United States' [unwillingness to support a **reckless
ally** may **mean nothing** for its determination to **defend that same
ally** against an unprovoked attack]{.underline}.
