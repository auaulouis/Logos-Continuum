WASHINGTON (AP) --- President Joe [Biden hailed a nascent Democratic
package of climate, health care and tax initiatives as "a giant step
forward" for the country Thursday as congressional leaders began nailing
down votes for a campaign-season bill they've cast as a boon for voters
struggling with inflation.]{.underline}

A day after Senate Majority Leader Chuck [[Schumer
and]{.underline}]{.mark} conservative Sen. Joe [[Manchin]{.mark} stunned
Washington by [resurrect]{.mark}ing]{.underline} components of a
[[compromise]{.underline}]{.mark} many thought dead, [early signs were
encouraging for the party.]{.underline}

After Schumer briefed Democratic senators on the 725-page measure, Sen.
Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said [lawmakers' reaction has been "uniformly
positive."]{.underline} And [[Reps]{.mark}.]{.underline} Tom
[Suozzi]{.underline}, D-N.Y., [and]{.underline} Tom
[Malinowski]{.underline}, D-N.J., [suggested they [**could** back the
measure even though it lacks higher]{.mark} federal [tax
deductions]{.mark} for state and local taxes that they've championed in
the past.]{.underline}

"We're taking a giant step forward as a nation,"
[**[Biden]{.mark}**]{.underline} said at the White House. In a
**[[message to lawmakers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he [[called it]{.mark}
a **compromise** that was "the strongest bill you can pass" to address
health care, climate, energy and families' living costs.]{.underline}
"Pass it, pass it for the American people."

The measure's phoenix-like rebirth came Wednesday, when Manchin
unexpectedly agreed to add tax, energy and environment provisions to a
plan he'd earlier said he wanted limited, for now, to prescription drug
price curbs and health care assistance. He told reporters Thursday that
his talks with Schumer had continued and disputed that he'd reversed
himself.

"I've never been in reverse in my lifetime and I never walked away,"
Manchin, who has COVID-19 and has stayed away from the Capitol, said in
a conference call. He also described what he said he's endured during
the past year, when he repeatedly forced Biden and top Democrats to
whittle down what was initially a \$3.5 trillion proposal.

"No one in their right mind would go through all the protest,
harassments" that he faced, [[Manchin said]{.underline}]{.mark}, after
he scuttled a roughly \$2 trillion version that the House had passed
after he insisted on cuts. He said Democrats "turned the dogs loose" on
him two weeks ago after he told Schumer that he wanted a measure limited
to health care this month because of inflation fears.

He said [[he was]{.mark} now [backing]{.mark} the expanded [bill
"because I know I'm not adding to inflation]{.mark}"]{.underline} with
the agreement. And he acknowledged that he wants the Mountain Valley
Pipeline, which will deliver natural gas from West Virginia to Virginia,
to be at "the top of the heap" under permitting procedures that Biden
and congressional leaders have pledged to move through Congress this
fall.

[Loose ends remain in a 50-50 Senate where [support from every
Dem]{.mark}ocrat --- plus Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking
vote --- [are needed to overcome unanimous Republican opposition]{.mark}
that seems preordained.]{.underline} Sen. Kyrsten
[[Sinema]{.underline}]{.mark}, D-Ariz., [who [last year joined Manchin
in forcing cuts]{.mark} and changes [in]{.mark} larger versions of [the
plan,]{.mark} [declined to tell]{.mark} reporters [her
stance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In the narrowly divided House, [Democrats can lose no more than four
votes and prevail.]{.underline} Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., a leader
of the centrist House Blue Dog Coalition, said she wouldn't yet comment
on her views. ["I don't think there's anybody wildly
pleased,"]{.underline} [said]{.underline} No. 2 House Democratic leader
Steny [Hoyer]{.underline} of Maryland. "But I think [the overwhelming
majority think the things that are in it are good things."]{.underline}

Overall, the emerging package would raise \$739 billion over a decade
from higher taxes on huge corporations and hedge fund owners, beefed up
IRS tax collections and lower federal costs from trimming pharmaceutical
prices. It would spend \$369 billion on energy and climate change
initiatives, what analysts and environmentalists called the largest
federal investment ever on clean energy. Another \$64 billion would be
to extend health insurance subsidies for three years, leaving \$306
billion for a modest swipe at massive federal deficits.

The measure is markedly less ambitious than the \$3.5 trillion version
that stumbled, shrank and ultimately died in Congress last year, largely
due to Manchin's opposition. The new bill lacks many of the party's
initial goals including funds for a more generous child tax credit, paid
family leave, expanded Medicare benefits and health care aid for poor
families in the dozen states --- mostly Republican and in the South ---
that refused to expand Medicaid under President Barack Obama's health
care law.

Even so, the surprise agreement moves Biden and Democrats to the edge of
claiming victory on top priorities like addressing global warming and
easing consumers' health care costs, and boosting levies on the affluent
to pay for it.

"It's bigger than nothing," said Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., who with other
progressives fought vainly last year against Manchin's efforts to trim
the proposal. After Manchin prevailed, "A lot of us thought this was
done unless we had more Senate seats, and the fact that we're able to
still get something quite substantial done is impressive."

Rep. Kurt [Schrader]{.underline}, D-Ore., another of his party's more
conservative lawmakers, [called the bill's prescription drug provisions
"the most important piece of legislation we'll vote on in this
Congress"]{.underline} besides last fall's infrastructure measure.

As leaders sold the plan to their members, the government reported that
the economy had constricted for a second straight quarter. Worries that
a recession was coming only intensified concerns over the nation's worst
bout with inflation since the 1980s.

Both parties know inflation and economic anxiety is on top of voters'
minds. With Republicans expected to win control of the House and perhaps
the Senate too, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., turned
his fire on Democrats' measure.

"Our colleagues across the aisle have already completely lost Americans'
trust on the economy, before this reckless taxing and spending spree.
Apparently they want to see how much farther they can fall," he said.

The bill would create tax credits for low- and middle-income buyers of
electric vehicles, plus grants and tax breaks to spur clean energy
technology and reduce carbon emissions.

Medicare would begin negotiating for the pharmaceuticals it buys,
prescription price increases would be limited and Medicare
beneficiaries' out-of-pocket drug costs would be capped at \$2,000
annually.

#### But PC and Speed are key

Negotiates Fresh Economic Plan as Inflation Antidote" June 17, 2022

**[[The White House and]{.mark} [congressional Democrats are in advanced
talks on legislation]{.mark}]{.underline}** that aims **[[to fight
inflation,]{.mark} rein in the deficit and revive parts
of]{.underline}** President Joe **[Biden's]{.underline}** stalled
**[economic agenda]{.underline}**. The contours of a potential deal
remain under negotiation, but **[the package would likely include
capping the price of insulin \-- a key medicine for diabetics \-- and
federal investments in both clean energy and fossil
fuels]{.underline}**, according to people briefed on the talks. It would
also further reduce the budget deficit and boost taxes on the wealthy,
corporations or both, they said. An agreement could come together as
soon as next week, two people said, though others were more cautious,
noting many details remain to be resolved. Climate provisions are a
particularly tricky area, and differences could still scotch a deal, one
person said. The people familiar with the talks asked not to be
identified because of the sensitivity of the negotiations, in which
Senator Joe [Manchin of West Virginia plays a central role. The
president has hinted at a coming agreement**, framing the legislation
primarily as a move to cool consumer-price increases**]{.underline},
which unexpectedly accelerated to an annual 8.6% in May. Not Everything
"I believe [I have the votes to do a number of things," Biden
said]{.underline} Thursday in an interview with the Associated Press,
citing capping insulin costs as an example. "We can reduce it to 35
bucks a month and get it done. We have the votes to do it. We're going
to get that done. I can't get it all done." **[Democrats are desperate
for a policy response to inflation]{.underline}**, which is at a
four-decade high and, unless curbed, is all but certain to cost them
control of the House, Senate or both in November's midterm elections.
Gasoline, a critical component of the American household budget, costs
\$5 a gallon on average nationwide, according to the AAA motor club, and
hit a record earlier this month. Seeking to quell the surge in living
costs, the Federal Reserve accelerated its monetary-tightening campaign
this week, executing the biggest interest-rate hike since 1994. The
moves have driven fresh losses on Wall Street and increased the odds of
a recession that would only compound Biden's political troubles. Biden
ordered a record release from the nation's oil reserves earlier this
year to try to curb gasoline prices, but to little effect. Now, he's
looking to help households save money on everyday needs like drugs,
utilities and internet access, and by cutting the government's budget
deficit, which reached a record \$3.13 trillion in fiscal 2020, during
the pandemic. **[The president sought to cut drug prices and raise taxes
on the wealthy in last year's]{.underline}** economic plan, called
**[Build Back Better, which Manchin killed]{.underline}** in December by
saying he'd vote against it. Democrats need all 50 of their Senate
caucus members to pass legislation in the 100-seat chamber under the
so-called budget-reconciliation process, which can bypass a Republican
filibuster. The White House for months has refused to publicly comment
on any talks with Manchin. The West Virginia senator bristled at White
House statements late last year as he, other Democrats and the
president's aides negotiated. The relationship between the White House
and Manchin was so damaged in the aftermath of that chapter that some
White House officials still avoid saying his name aloud. Other Elements
"[**[The president remains engaged with Congress]{.mark}**. This is an
important part of his economic agenda]{.underline}," Cecilia Rouse,
chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said Friday at
the White House. Along with the new legislation, Biden has recently
touted a provision of the infrastructure law enacted last year that
offers full rebates for some home-internet plans for low-income
households. He's also urged Congress to pass separate legislation that
would encourage domestic manufacturing of semiconductors to help ease
global shortages that have contributed to rising prices for cars and
consumer electronics. Together, he argues the measures would provide
Americans a counterbalance for higher food and gasoline prices. The
administration is also clamoring for new Covid funding from Congress,
but as of now there are no plans to roll that into any reconciliation
deal, two of the people said. Senate Duo **[[Biden
met]{.underline}]{.mark}** Wednesday [with]{.mark} Senate Majority
Leader Chuck **[[Schumer and]{.underline}]{.mark}** House Speaker Nancy
**[[Pelosi]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with the trio **[[discussing next
steps]{.mark} on a fresh bill to pass through the reconciliation
process. [The White House called the measure their "shared agenda of
tackling inflation]{.mark} and lowering prices and transitioning from a
historic economic recovery to stable, steady growth"]{.underline}** in a
statement on the meeting. The talks have largely narrowed to two men:
Schumer and Manchin. The basis for their discussions is legislation the
House passed last year that would raise federal revenue by \$1.5
trillion over a decade, one person said. White House spokespeople didn't
immediately respond to a request for comment on the talks. A person
familiar with **[[Manchin's]{.underline}]{.mark}** thinking said he is
**[[continuing to negotiate]{.mark} with Schumer]{.underline}**, and
hasn't set a July 4 deadline for reaching a deal. The person said energy
and climate is just one of the issues still being worked on. The House
bill included a surtax on wealthy Americans, expanded levies on
investments, had a 15% minimum rate for corporations and a tax on stock
buybacks. Savings in drug costs could push so-called pay-fors in the
bill to \$1.8 trillion over a decade. Manchin has insisted that at least
half of the new tax revenue in the bill go to reducing the deficit.
Energy Components Senator Kyrsten Sinema, however, has signaled
objections to many tax increases, leaving unclear which revenue measures
might make a final agreement. The Arizona Democrat this week said she's
focused on talks on new gun-safety legislation. Energy provisions remain
among the sticking points in the negotiations on the reconciliation
bill, with Manchin \-- whose state still produces much of the nation's
coal supply \-- advocating for fossil-fuel suppliers.
**[[Proponents]{.mark} of the legislation [are aiming for a deal]{.mark}
soon that can pass [before members]{.mark} of Congress [leave for
their]{.mark} annual [August recess.]{.mark} ]{.underline}**

**[After that, lawmakers will have little time to legislate as they
focus on their re-election campaigns.]{.underline}**

#### NATO support costs [PC]{.underline} and [focus]{.underline}

**The Economist 22**, 7/18/22, The Economist is a 178-year newspaper
specializing on the political economy, international politics and more,
this article is from their extensive cover of the Russo-Ukranian
conflict and it's geopolitical effects., "Is America growing weary of
The Long War in Ukraine?"

Khamari

[President joe biden pledges to support Ukraine for "as long as it
takes". His administration has spent about \$8bn on military aid alone.
In May, [Congress passed a]{.mark} \$40bn [supplemental
budget]{.mark}---more than Mr Biden had asked for, and more than the
annual defence budgets of most European allies---to assist Ukraine and
deal with the war's global consequences.]{.underline}

[**[But]{.mark}** nearly [six months into the fight]{.mark}, with the
prospect of a [long
war](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/06/30/does-a-protracted-conflict-favour-russia-or-ukraine)
to come, **[even]{.mark}** Mr [Biden's closest allies are asking whether
America might]{.mark} soon [**tire of the burden**. The president
is]{.mark} more **[unpopular]{.mark}** even than Donald Trump was at
this point in his presidency. [Inflation has hit a]{.mark} four-decade
[high]{.mark}. And Republicans are set to make important gains in
[mid-term elections in
November](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/07/14/democrats-in-america-are-realising-they-must-moderate-or-die),
where they are likely to take control of the House of Representatives
and possibly also the Senate]{.underline}.

In an article in Delaware Online, [Chris Coons, a Democratic senator and
close ally of Mr Biden's, praised [NATO]{.mark}'s show of [unity]{.mark}
at a summit in Madrid last month. He also said he was "concerned about
the commitment of the American people and its elected leaders to stay
the course as the invasion grinds on."]{.underline} Vladimir Putin,
Russia's leader, he separately told The Economist, "is counting on the
West losing focus".

[The aid for Ukraine is meant to last only until the end of September.
Few in Congress think another big package can be passed before the
mid-terms; many say it will probably be hard to get lawmakers to agree
to one thereafter. "It [will be an **uphill battle**]{.mark}," says a
Republican Senate staffer. "The sales pitch from the last time is not
good enough now, because the war has fundamentally changed and [the
**domestic situation at home is different**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Americans broadly support helping Ukraine, and many want the government
to do more despite the economic price they must pay for that. According
to a YouGov poll conducted this month for The Economist, 39% of
respondents---a plurality---think that the Biden administration's policy
should be "tougher". Half or more support various forms of assistance.
But given America's polarisation, Republicans are warier than Democrats.
About one in five Republicans say Mr Biden should be less tough. A
plurality, 43%, do not want to give more money to Ukraine. They are also
less likely than Democrats to favour giving it advanced weapons.

Congressional aides point to three factors likely to affect support for
Ukraine. The first is the complexion of Congress after the mid-terms. If
Republicans retake one or both chambers, it will matter which faction in
the party has the upper hand. Will it be the old establishment
represented by Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader who in May
took senior colleagues to Kyiv to meet Ukraine's president, Volodymyr
Zelensky? Or will it be the devotees of Mr Trump and his maga ("Make
America Great Again") nativism?

[Mr [Trump]{.mark} still **[holds much of the party]{.mark} in
[thrall](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/01/01/the-republicans-are-still-donald-trumps-party-and-they-can-still-win)**.
[He denounced]{.mark} the recent **[aid]{.mark} for Ukraine**, saying:
"The Democrats are sending another \$40bn to Ukraine, yet America's
parents are struggling to even feed their children." **[His base might
be energised]{.mark}** if, in coming weeks, he announces he will run for
president again in 2024. "Fact is **[if]{.mark}** the **[Republicans
take over]{.mark} the House** in 2022 us **[support to Ukraine
will]{.mark} come to a [halt]{.mark}**," tweeted Ruben Gallego, a House
Democrat. Republican leaders, he predicted, would not be able to stop
Trumpists like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz "from dictating our
Ukraine policy". Mr Gaetz shot back: "Ruben is correct."]{.underline}

Such boasting amounts to "wish-casting", says Eric Edelman, a former
Pentagon official under George W. Bush. maga disciples are still a
minority among congressional Republicans. Still, he frets, they could
grow larger after the elections. If they make up a bigger share of
Republicans in the House---where spending bills originate---and
particularly if they hold the balance of power, it will become harder to
provide more aid to Ukraine. Few expect the fickle Kevin McCarthy, the
Republican House leader, to resist the Trumpian right, even though he
has praised Mr Zelensky as "a modern-day Winston Churchill". Pressure
will increase on the Senate (whether controlled by Democrats or Mr
McConnell's Republicans) to tame the excesses of maga-world. The matter
of Ukraine, says Mr Edelman, is part of "the larger battle for the soul
of the Republican Party".

[A second factor is the extent to which allies are willing to keep
helping Ukraine confront Russia. "How much are our European partners
doing? That's literally the first question I get," says Mr Coons. For
most Americans, he notes, Ukraine is "half a world away". European
countries are closer to Russia's military threat, and also more
[vulnerable to the danger of
escalation](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/14/europes-winter-of-discontent),
the loss of Russian energy supplies and the outflow of
refugees.]{.underline}

[Perhaps the biggest consideration is the third factor: Ukraine's
progress on the battlefield. If the [Biden]{.mark} administration
[can]{.mark} show that it is helping Ukrainians to gain ground, rather
than [get]{.mark}ting [**bogged down**]{.mark} in another "forever war",
support will be easier to rally. But a protracted conflict looks all too
likely.]{.underline}

#### IRA solves climate\-\--extinction

Inflation Reduction Act Means for Climate,\" Earthjustice,
https://earthjustice.org/brief/2022/what-the-inflation-reduction-act-means-for-climate

[Democrats in the Senate have reached a deal to pass the Inflation
Reduction Act, a bill that will invest \$369 billion in climate
solutions and environmental justice]{.underline}. [[The bill
would]{.underline}]{.mark} put us on a path to [40 percent emissions
reduction by 2030 while **[restor]{.mark}ing [U.S. credibility]{.mark}**
[to lead climate action on the global stage]{.mark}.]{.underline}

We knew there would be painful provisions in any bill that could get
Sen. Jon Manchin's support, and [the bill]{.mark} contains some
troubling giveaways to fossil fuel interests that will cause undue harm
to communities in the Gulf and Alaska. As a whole, however, [[it would
be a huge step forward in the fight to **preserve a livable planet** and
is one we need to take while we have the chance]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Earthjustice is advocating for the bill's swift passage because
**[[climate cannot wait]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

What just happened:

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Manchin (D-W.Va.)
released initial details of the bill on July 27.

Their agreement is significant because Democrats need Manchin's vote in
a narrowly divided Senate to pass climate legislation in the Senate.

A previous ambitious climate bill, the House-passed Build Back Better
Act, sank after Manchin opposed it.

**[[The bill includes notable wins on climate]{.mark} and environmental
justice:]{.underline}**

[[It would put the U.S. on a path to a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions by 2030.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[It would lower household energy costs by helping people afford to
electrify their homes and vehicles, including \$9 billion in consumer
home energy rebate programs]{.underline}.

[It would [invest \$60 billion in manufacturing solar panels, batteries,
electric vehicles, and other clean energy technologies]{.mark} in the
U.S., which will create jobs and increase energy security.]{.underline}

[It would put \$60 billion towards addressing the disproportionate harms
some communities face from pollution and the climate

themselves.

It would pump [[\$20 billion into climate-friendly

## UQ

### 2NC\-\--UQ\-\--Sinema

#### Sinema will cave to party pressure.

Hugh **Hewitt 22**, 8-2-2022, \"Four ways to improve the Manchin
package,\" Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/02/manchin-bill-navy-education/
/ mml

[[Assume]{.mark} that Sen. Kyrsten [Sinema]{.mark} (D-Ariz.)
[signals]{.mark} her [support for the]{.mark} massive tax-and-spending
[bill]{.mark} agreed to last week by Senate Majority Leader Charles E.
Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.). That's not a sure
thing, of course, but [party pressure]{.mark} on Sinema [is likely to
have an impact.]{.mark}]{.underline} Then an open floor amendment
process begins in which Republicans can put forth their own amendments.
If Republican senators stick together, hold all 50 of their votes and
find just one Democrat to support one or more of their successful
amendments all the way through the Senate finish line and the
"wraparound" amendment typically used to strip out the "symbolic vote"
amendments, the real changes will get included in any final measure sent
to the House. Most "poison pill" amendments --- designed to kill a much
bigger measure before final passage --- are normally a waste of time.
But one can easily see four amendments that Republicans should try to
add to the Schumer-Manchin bill that could survive the last hurdle if
attention fixes on them. First, look to the Pacific. "Reconciliation"
--- the name for the legislative process under which this huge bill
proceeds --- should redirect some of the unprecedented largesse flowing
out of the treasury to the two classes of new submarines we must have
--- and the shipyards that build and maintain them. While boosting the
number of sailors vital to the long conflict ahead with China, lawmakers
should reduce military force structure not geared to conflict in the
Pacific. A NATO reenergized by Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in
Ukraine means the United States can move to fully fund its commitments
to the Pacific Rim. Our subsurface fleet is the future of great-power
competition. Reconciliation should --- finally --- put Congress's money
where its mouth has been for years: into the Navy, especially the
Columbia-class subs that will be the backbone of our future nuclear
deterrence. Second, condition federal funding for elementary and high
schools on the elimination of teaching in elementary grades divisive
subjects such as human intimacy, gender and race. Those subjects are
best taught in upper grades, and only when parents are fully informed.
Public school teachers are public employees. Federal money comes with
federal strings, and those strings should serve to limit the radical
ideologues at work in public schools. Third, provide start-up funds for
construction and expansion of new charter schools --- both public and
private, and yes, religious and secular --- on an equal basis with funds
for public schools. Republicans will be hard-pressed to persuade the
Senate parliamentarian to rule that such an amendment is germane to a
tax-and-spend bill, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't try. Capital
outlays for buildings count as infrastructure, and small deductions from
the other billions should meet the test. So should reallocation of
existing federal funding from some Education Department boondoggles to
make a start. Along the way, it would be smart to take some steps to
force the feds to stop the "woke" movement increasingly seeping into
K-12 curriculums. Finally, the Schumer-Manchin compromise is allegedly a
huge push to combat global climate change. It appears on close
inspection to be a huge push to bail out early investors in green
technologies for which no self-sustaining markets have materialized.
Slice off some of the billions about to be wasted and mandate the
technology that will actually cut harmful emissions: a new nuclear plant
in every state. [[Manchin caved]{.mark} in to his party. [Sinema
will]{.mark} likely [follow]{.mark}.]{.underline} But the latest move in
Democratic spending is a huge opportunity for the GOP to define the fall
campaign beyond President Biden's many and manifest failures. If the GOP
uses the weeks ahead to demand more spending on our Navy and on
alternatives to government schools and to make a strong stand in favor
of the nuclear power that will keep our homes lit and warm for
generations to come, Manchin's collapse can provide even more GOP
definition for the fall campaign.

#### IRA passes -- Sinema's on the line but Dems cooperate with her on fiscal issues.

Tony **Romm 22**, 8-2-2022, \"Democrats race to ready Inflation
Reduction Act for vote this week,\" Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/08/02/democrats-inflation-reduction-act-bill/
/ mml

[Senate [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s are racing]{.mark} to ready their
health-care, climate and tax package [for a]{.mark} grueling [floor
fight]{.mark} as soon as [this week]{.mark}, even as some in the party
remain fearful about the potential for last-minute political
disruptions. Six days after striking a legislative deal to the shock of
Washington, [Dem]{.mark}ocratic leader[s]{.mark} still [have much to
do]{.mark} ahead of a final vote: [They need]{.mark} to shore up
[support among their own ranks]{.mark},]{.underline} steel themselves
for new Republican attacks and prepare for the possibility that a
coronavirus outbreak could rattle even the best laid plans around the
Inflation Reduction Act. No less than President Biden's agenda hangs in
the balance, just three months before voters are set to head to the
polls to decide if Democrats should keep their majorities in the House
and Senate. But party lawmakers still have expressed a measure of
confidence in recent days, hoping they might avoid the same stunning
defeat that scuttled their economic ambitions last year. [To start,
Senate Majority Leader Charles E. [Schumer]{.mark} (D-N.Y.) [has yet to
secure]{.mark} the support of one of his caucus members: Sen. Kyrsten
[Sinema]{.mark} (D-Ariz.), [a fiscal hawk and political
moderate]{.mark}, has said she is still reviewing the proposal --- a
position her aides repeated on Monday.]{.underline} In the meantime,
party lawmakers have faced an intensifying onslaught of criticism from
Republicans, who long have opposed their plans to combat climate change,
reduce health-care costs and revise the U.S. tax code. On Monday, many
top GOP lawmakers painted the Democratic package as a tax increase on
Americans. Republicans cited an analysis that only looked at some of the
elements in the broader spending bill, omitting key sections that aim to
lower Americans' health-care costs, in an approach Democrats described
as misleading. [Even amid the uncertainty, [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark}
nonetheless have remained jubilant, [feel]{.mark}ing [they may be on the
cusp]{.mark} of delivering on a long-stalled package of economic
revisions [after Schumer and]{.mark} Sen. Joe [Manchin]{.mark} III
(D-W.Va.) [clinched an agreement]{.mark} last week.]{.underline} The
resolution marked a stunning turnaround from the collapse that befell
the party seven months ago, when Manchin scuttled the broader roughly
\$2 trillion bill known as the Build Back Better Act. "Our timeline has
not changed, and I expect to bring this legislation to the Senate floor
to begin voting this week," Schumer said Monday. The newer, smaller
measure includes \$433 billion in new spending to combat climate change
and reduce health insurance and drug costs for millions of Americans.
The investments targeting global warming constitute the largest single
burst in federal spending on clean energy and emissions-fighting
programs in U.S. history. To pay for the package, Democrats have put
forward a wide array of revisions to federal tax law, including a new
minimum tax on billion-dollar businesses that currently pay nothing to
the U.S. government. Along with their prescription drug pricing
revisions, which save Medicare money, the provisions together are
expected to raise about \$739 billion over the next decade. That is
enough offset Democrats' newly proposed spending while paying down the
deficit by \$300 billion. [Already, Democrats and Republicans have
squared off fiercely over the bill and its fiscal implications. Taking
to the Senate floor, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday
said the costs of the spending bill could fall heaviest on manufacturers
in particular. Alluding to recent data from the nonpartisan Joint
Committee on Taxation (JCT), he described the consequences as a "body
blow on a party-line vote."]{.underline} But Democrats pointed to a
follow-up analysis from JCT, released Tuesday morning, that found the
manufacturing category includes tech, pharmaceutical and apparel
companies. Lawmakers noted that some of the companies in those
industries previously have been targeted in congressional investigations
for dodging U.S. taxes, though no specific firm was mentioned in the new
report. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the chairman of the tax-focused Senate
Finance Committee, said in a statement that it reflected companies
"playing the most games, and avoiding tax by manufacturing their drugs,
phones, and shoes abroad." GOP lawmakers also have argued the tax
proposals violate Biden's pledge not to raise rates on Americans who
make less than \$400,000 annually, pointing to another set of JCT data
that suggest companies could pass a new minimum tax onto Americans.
Democrats, however, have sharply rejected that reasoning: They say their
tax doesn't target families and aims instead to make companies pay taxes
that they should have been paying in the first place. And Democrats add
that JCT did not factor into their math other benefits afforded by their
bill, including provisions that help Americans pay for prescription
drugs and health insurance. "The more this bill is analyzed by impartial
experts, the more we can see Democrats are trying to sell the American
people a bill of goods," said Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), the top
Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, in a statement Monday. In
response, Manchin on Monday stressed that there is "not one penny of
change in taxes," telling reporters that a minimum rate on companies is
"only fair." Schumer, separately, said it would "close loopholes long
exploited by the largest corporations." [For now, Senate Democrats have
focused much of their efforts on preparing the bill for the floor. The
task has spanned countless meetings with the chamber's parliamentarian,
as party lawmakers look to ensure their spending proposal adheres to the
strict [rules of reconciliation]{.mark}. The tactic [allows
Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s to adopt their bill using]{.mark} their
[51-vote]{.mark}, tiebreaking [majority]{.mark}, rather than the usual
60 votes required in the chamber. A final vote could still be days away,
since [reconciliation opens the door for lawmakers to offer]{.mark} an
[unlimited]{.mark} number of [amendments]{.mark}. Republican aides have
signaled they plan to put forward as many politically challenging
proposals as they can, [making it hard for Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s to stay
together]{.mark}, keep their bill intact and hold a vote
swiftly.]{.underline} More unpredictably, however, the coronavirus could
further dent Democrats' plans, since the party cannot afford absences
that deny them must-have votes. Manchin has recovered from his
coronavirus diagnosis, but another Democrat, Sen. Richard J. Durbin,
(Ill.), tested positive at the end of last week. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy
(D-Vt.), meanwhile, has been out for weeks recovering from hip surgery,
though he is expected to return for the consideration of a
reconciliation bill. And Republicans on Monday lost Sen. John Cornyn
(R-Tex.) to a covid-19 infection, tipping the scales at least for now
toward Democrats' favor. Cornyn, however, pledged to be back as soon as
federal health guidelines allow --- "if it happens," he tweeted,
referring to the prospect of a final vote. [Yet
[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} could [face]{.mark} additional
[roadblocks]{.mark} as a result of their own members, particularly
[Sinema]{.mark}, who has not yet offered her final views on the bill.
Her earlier objections to the Build Back Better Act forced party leaders
to whittle down their plans considerably. The Arizona moderate last year
[did not support]{.mark} Democrats' initial [efforts to raise tax
rates]{.mark} on corporations and wealthy Americans, leaving them no
choice but to abandon a central element of Biden's agenda. Instead,
[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s settled on]{.mark} the [corporate minimum tax, which
appeared]{.mark} at the time [to have Sinema's blessing.]{.mark} But it
remains unclear if she still supports that policy, given the broader
changes in the economy, since her party last tried to move a spending
package. [Sinema previously expressed concern with]{.mark} other
elements of [the plan]{.mark}, including Democrats' renewed effort to
close what is known as the carried interest loophole. The policy allows
private equity, real estate and hedge fund managers, among others, to
pay less in taxes.]{.underline}

#### Sinema supports the vast majority of this bill.

**Wa**shington **Po**st **22**, 8-1-2022, \"Don't sink this bill, Sen.
Sinema,\" Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/01/kyrsten-sinema-should-support-inflation-reduction-act/
/ mml

[Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) reportedly wasn't included in talks
between Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader
Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) as they hammered out the details of
[the]{.mark} surprise [I]{.mark}nflation [R]{.mark}eduction [A]{.mark}ct
announced last week. The deal, nonetheless, [is]{.mark} largely [in line
with]{.mark} the [preferences she laid out]{.mark} in past negotiations:
[from]{.mark} its relatively modest reforms to prescription [drug
pricing to]{.mark} action on [climate to]{.mark} the 15 percent
[corporate minimum tax]{.mark} rate estimated to raise \$313 billion.
Indeed, that the legislation neglects broader hikes on the
highest-income Americans is itself a form of concession.]{.underline}
There is, however, a big exception. The closure of the carried interest
loophole has been a boogeyman for Ms. Sinema from the beginning. But it
is in the bill before her today --- and for good reason. The carried
interest loophole is essentially a way for fund managers to make a lot
of money and pay the government very little back because the share of
the fund's profits they receive for their work is taxed at a top rate of
just under 24 percent --- dramatically less than the 37 percent top rate
for ordinary income. This giveaway is so valuable that many have it to
thank for the bulk of their fortunes. The Wall Street Journal reported
last week that Blackstone Inc. Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman
received somewhere around \$150 million in carried interest compensation
last year; two other executives at the company received close to \$92
million and \$77 million. There's simply no excuse for any lawmaker who
purports to care about economic justice or equality to oppose
eliminating the carried interest loophole. Yet all the same, Congress
--- many of whose members benefit from the donations of the
deep-pocketed --- could allow this scandal to persist, especially if Ms.
Sinema demands it. She shouldn't. Republicans have been making hay in
recent days of an analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on
Taxation, claiming that the reconciliation would raise rates on those
earning less than \$400,000 per year, contrary to President Biden's
pledges. This is mostly meaningless. The theory that some of the new 15
percent minimum tax on corporations would be passed on to employees and
to shareholders doesn't change the reality that the bulk of the burden
would fall on the richest and the bulk of the benefit would redound to
those worse off: whether it comes as help affording medicine or health
care or as an investment in slowing global warming. [Ms. [Sinema
shouldn't sink this bill]{.mark}, most of [whose contents she has
indicated]{.mark} in the past that [she supports]{.mark}.]{.underline}
And she shouldn't sink it because she opposes closing the carried
interest loophole. That provision unambiguously aids those who need help
most, at the expense only of those who need it not at all.

newly revived domestic spending package again faces uncertainty as the
revamped legislation seeks [to [close tax loopholes supported by key
party moderates.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Democ[ratic]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Senator [Joe

Leader]{.mark} [Chuck
Schumer](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/chuck-schumer) of New York [on
]{.mark}]{.underline}a bill that includes money for health care and
climate change. The West Virginia moderate has been a key holdout as the
bill was slimmed during months of negotiations. But Democrats\' tight
margins in [Congress](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/congress) mean
Arizona Senator [Kyrsten
Sinema](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/kyrsten-sinema) and a group of
House moderates could sink the bill to preserve tax provisions that
critics say favor wealthy households.

[Dubbed the [I]{.mark}nflation [R]{.mark}eduction
[A]{.mark}]{.underline}ct [of 2022, the legislation]{.underline}
dedicates \$369 billion for climate and energy spending[, while seeking
to reduce the federal deficit by \$300 billion and cutting federal
spending on prescription drugs by \$288 billion, according to
a [summary](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary.pdf).
The bill also contains provisions to expedite domestic energy production
and allow Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over
prescription drugs.]{.underline}

Manchin and Schumer said in the statement that \"the investments will be
fully paid for by closing tax loopholes on wealthy individuals and
corporations.\"

While details on the bill are forthcoming[,]{.underline} Manchin issued
a separate statement calling for the end of tax loopholes like carried
interest as well as the state and local tax deduction (often referred to
as \"SALT.\")

Carried interest is the portion of an investment company\'s profits paid
to a manager or partner. Because the money is treated as capital gains,
it\'s taxed at a lower rate than income[.]{.underline} Critics, who
include Massachusetts Senator [Elizabeth
Warren](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/elizabeth-warren) and
former [President Donald
Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump), say carried
interest means wealthy investment managers end up paying a lower tax
rate than other lower-paying professionals.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce [says eliminating
it](https://www.uschamber.com/taxes/new-us-chamber-study-shows-proposed-carried-interest-tax-increase-would-reduce) would
cost 4.9 million jobs within five years.

As negotiations were underway last year on a different version of the
legislative package, [*The New York
Times*](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/new-york-times)**[ ]{.underline}**reported
that [[Sinema privately said she would oppose any corporate or income
tax rate increases.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Although [[Sinema signaled last year that she was supportive of the
spending bill, she has not issued a statement concerning the Inflation
Reduction Act]{.underline}]{.mark} as of Wednesday
evening. **[Newsweek ]{.underline}**has reached out to Sinema\'s office
for comment. In the House, a group of [moderate
Democrats](https://gottheimer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2816) have
been pressing to reinstate SALT, which allows taxpayers to deduct state
and local taxes from their federal tax bill, after previously being
capped by the Republican tax bill in 2018. New Jersey Representative
Josh Gottheimer, who has led efforts to reinstate SALT, told Politico
that he didn\'t immediately oppose the legislation. I\'ve got to
understand the impact it has on families in my district,\" he said.

#### UQ\-\-- Health-care bill will pass\--reconciliation and support from Manchin emerge

Emma **Newburger 7/22**, Reporter for Consumer News and Business Channel
(CNBC), 7/28/2022, "Schumer-Manchin reconciliation bill has \$369
billion to fight climate change --- here are the details,"
[[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/schumer-manchin-reconciliation-bill-climate-change-provisions.html]{.underline}](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/schumer-manchin-reconciliation-bill-climate-change-provisions.html)
-Jinrong

Senate Majority Leader Chuck [[Schumer]{.underline}]{.mark}, D-N.Y.,
[and]{.mark} Sen. Joe [[Manchin]{.underline}]{.mark}, D-W.V., on
Wednesday [[unveiled]{.mark} a [long-anticipated
**reconciliation**]{.mark} package [that]{.mark} would [invest]{.mark}
hundreds of [billions of dollars to **combat climate change**]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [advance clean energy programs]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The 725-page piece of legislation, called the "Inflation Reduction Act
of 2022," provides [\$369 billion for climate and clean energy
provisions]{.underline}, the most aggressive climate investment ever
taken by Congress. The bill's climate provisions (summarized here) would
[slash the country's carbon emissions by roughly 40%]{.underline} by
2030, according to a summary of the deal.

[The **[abrupt announcement]{.mark}** of the deal [**came less than two
weeks** after **Manchin**]{.mark}]{.underline}, a key centrist who holds
the swing vote in the 50-50 Senate, [[said he wouldn't support]{.mark}
any climate provisions until he had a better understanding of the
inflation figures for July.]{.underline}

If passed and signed into law, the act would include funding for the
following:

Manufacturing clean energy products, including a \$10 billion investment
tax credit to manufacturing facilities for things like electric
vehicles, wind turbines, and solar panels, and \$30 billion for
additional production tax credits to accelerate domestic manufacturing
of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and critical minerals
processing. It would also include up to \$20 billion in loans to build
new clean vehicle manufacturing facilities across the U.S., and \$2
billion to revamp existing auto plants to make clean vehicles.

Cutting emissions, including \$20 billion for the agriculture sector and
\$3 billion to reduce air pollution at ports. It also includes
unspecified funding for a program to reduce methane emissions, which are
often produced as a byproduct of oil and gas production, and are more
than 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide in warming the atmosphere. In
addition, the act allocates \$9 billion for the federal government to
buy American-made clean technologies, including \$3 billion for the U.S.
Postal Service to buy zero-emission vehicles.

Research and development, including a \$27 billion clean energy
technology accelerator to support deployment of technologies that curb
emissions and \$2 billion for breakthrough energy research in government
labs.

Preserving and supporting natural resources, including \$5 billion in
grants to support healthy forests, forest conservation, and urban tree
planting, and \$2.6 billion in grants to conserve and restore coastal
habitats.

Support for states, including about \$30 billion in grant and loan
programs for states and electric utilities to advance the clean energy
transition.

Environmental justice initiatives, amounting to more than \$60 billion
to address the unequal effects of pollution on low-income communities
and communities of color.

For individuals, a \$7,500 tax credit to buy new electric vehicles and a
\$4,000 credit for buying a used one. Both credits would only be
available to lower and middle income consumers.

["[I **support** a plan that]{.mark} will [advance]{.mark} a [realistic
energy and climate policy]{.mark} that lowers prices today and
strategically invests in the long game," [**Manchin**
said]{.mark}]{.underline} in a statement on Wednesday. "This legislation
ensures that the market will take the lead, rather than aspirational
political agendas or unrealistic goals, in the energy transition that
has been ongoing in our country."

The Senate is set to vote on the proposed legislation next week, after
which it will go to the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.

President Joe Biden on Wednesday said the tax credits and [[investments
for energy projects]{.underline}]{.mark} in the agreement would
[[create]{.mark} thousands of [new jobs and]{.mark} help [lower energy
costs]{.mark}, and urged the Senate to move on the legislation as soon
as possible.]{.underline}

The president has vowed to curb U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to
52% from 2005 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by
mid-century. With no reconciliation bill, the country is on track to
miss that goal, according to a recent analysis by the independent
research firm Rhodium Group.

"This is the action the American people have been waiting for," the
president said in a statement on Wednesday. "This addresses the problems
of today -- high health care costs and overall inflation -- as well as
investments in our energy security for the future."

[Manchin]{.underline}, a Democrat from West Virginia whose resistance
had long derailed sweeping legislation on those issues, [abruptly
revealed the agreement]{.underline} in a press release, [followed by a
joint release with Schumer. ]{.underline}

The announcement from Manchin came hours after the Senate [passed the
Chips and Science
Act](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-chips-act-subsidize-semiconductor-chip-production/),
a bill to subsidize investments in domestic semiconductor chip
production. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had threatened to
stymie the semiconductor bill if Democrats continued to pursue
party-line reconciliation legislation.

\"From here forward, the debate over a future reconciliation bill or any
targeted legislation must focus on supporting the everyday hardworking
Americans we have been elected to serve,\" Manchin said in a statement.
\"I support the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 because it provides a
responsible path forward that is laser focused on solving our nation\'s
major economic, energy and climate problems. The question for my
colleagues is whether they are willing to put their election politics
aside and embrace the commonsense approach that the overwhelming
majority of the American people support and will best serve the future
of this nation.\"

According to a one-page description of the legislation from Schumer and
Manchin, [the [bill]{.mark} would [invest \$369 billion in
energy]{.mark} security []{.mark}and [climate change and extend the
Affordable Care Act program]{.mark} for three years]{.underline}. In
addition, the legislation would grant Medicare the ability to negotiate
prescription drug prices. 

Senator Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday noted the finality of the deal.

\"The good news here is that [[it is Senator Manchin]{.mark}, who is
[announcing a deal]{.mark}]{.underline}, not that they\'re close to a
deal or not that there are some parts to a deal,\" she said. 

House progressives also seemed
optimistic, [tweeting](https://twitter.com/USProgressives/status/1552425773109329920?s=20&t=E3lxhYHFOyiFLlvcXavcfA),
\"We\'ll need to evaluate the details, [but [it\'s
promising]{.mark}]{.underline} a [deal]{.underline} to deliver on those
issues might finally be in reach.\"

Republicans immediately criticized Manchin\'s agreement. Senator John
Cornyn of Texas called it \"Manchin\'s New Build Back Broke Bill.\"

\"Senate Democrats can change the name of Build Back Broke as many times
as they want, it won\'t be any less devastating to American families and
small businesses,\" Cornyn said. \"Raising taxes on job creators,
crushing energy producers with new regulations, and stifling innovators
looking for new cures will only make this recession worse, not better.\"

Inti

[Manchin announced the agreement in a joint statement with Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y]{.underline}., after months of
negotiations between the two appeared to break down recently. The deal
represents a major breakthrough for elements of President Joe Biden\'s
agenda that appeared to be all but dead.

"[[The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022]{.mark} [will]{.mark} make a
historic down payment on de**ficit reduction** to **[fight
inflation]{.mark}**, [invest in domestic energy production and
manufacturing]{.mark}, [and **reduce carbon emissions**]{.mark} by
roughly 40 percent by 2030]{.underline}," Schumer and Manchin said in a
statement. \"The bill will finally allow Medicare to negotiate for
prescription drugs and lower health care costs for millions of
Americans. Additionally, we have reached agreement with President Biden
and Speaker Pelosi to pass comprehensive permitting reform legislation
before the end of this fiscal year. We urge every member of the U.S.
Senate to support this important legislation." The two Democrats said
the text of the deal will be submitted to the Senate parliamentarian on
Wednesday evening \"and the [full Senate will consider it next
week]{.underline}.\"

The legislation, released by Schumer, still needs the support of all 50
Democratic-voting senators to become law, without hope of winning GOP
support. But Manchin, who represents a deeply conservative state, has
been the biggest holdout to a major bill for months, [giv]{.mark}ing a
version of [the proposal **[strong odds of passing the
Senate]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

It would also have to pass the House before it reaches Biden's desk.

Biden praised the deal in a statement.

\"This afternoon, I spoke with Senators Schumer and Manchin and offered
my support for the agreement they have reached on a bill to fight
inflation and lower costs for American families,\" Biden said, urging
speedy passage of the bill. \"This is the action the American people
have been waiting for. This addresses the problems of today --- high
health care costs and overall inflation --- as well as investments in
our energy security for the future.\"

According to a one-page summary, [the bill will include \$739 billion in
new revenue through a 15% corporate minimum tax, prescription drug
savings and added IRS enforcement, and [it will **limit the so-called
carried interest tax break**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### UQ\-\-- Manchin has agreed to a top agenda bill, will pass and a big win for dems

<https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/27/manchin-schumer-senate-deal-energy-taxes-00048325>

**Joe Manchin and Chuck Schumer looked at loggerheads after their talks
on a sweeping climate, tax and health care bill ran aground nearly two
weeks ago. In fact, they were working on Washington's best-kept
secret.\**

**On July 18, four [[days after Manchin and Schumer's talks seemed to
fizzle out]{.underline}]{.mark} with only a limited health care deal,
[[Manchin reached out to Schumer to]{.underline}]{.mark} see if he was
amenable to [[pick]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[things back up]{.mark}. [By
Wednesday afternoon, they had a deal on a bill that includes energy and
tax policy, a turnaround after]{.mark}]{.underline} the two
[[deadlock]{.underline}]{.mark}ed on Democrats' marquee party-line
agenda.**

**"It's like two brothers from different mothers, I guess. He gets
pissed off, I get pissed off, and we'll go back and forth. He basically
put out statements, and the dogs came after me again," [[Manchin
said]{.underline}]{.mark} in an interview on Wednesday. ["[We just
worked through it]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

**All throughout last week, Manchin stayed quiet about the talks even as
most senators, staffers and journalists had moved on: "I didn't know if
it could come to fruition. I really didn't know, OK, so why talk about
something, again, build people's hopes up? I got the ire of
everybody."**

**That ire turned into jubilation within the Democratic Party by
Wednesday night after [[Manchin and Schumer announced what they dubbed
"the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022," which is slated for the Senate
floor]{.underline}]{.mark} next week. There's still significant concerns
to be dealt with over whether it can meet chamber rules for avoiding a
filibuster, and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) hasn't signed off yet ---
but Manchin's deal with Schumer amounts to [[the best news for Democrats
in weeks]{.underline}]{.mark}.**

**Moreover, Manchin's announcement came hours after final passage of
semiconductor legislation, a bill Republicans threatened to block mere
weeks ago in an effort to stop Democrats from pursuing a party-line tax,
climate and health care package.**

**[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} Manchin-Schumer [[deal includes roughly
\$370 billion in energy and climate spending, \$300 billion in deficit
reduction, three years of subsidies for A]{.underline}]{.mark}ffordable
[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}are [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ct premiums,
prescription [[drug reform and significant tax
changes.]{.underline}]{.mark} Manchin said the bill was at one point
"bigger than that" but that's where the two Democrats settled.**

**As part of the agreement announced Wednesday, Schumer and Speaker
Nancy Pelosi agreed to pass legislation governing energy permits.
Manchin said he spoke to Schumer, Pelosi and President Joe Biden on
Wednesday.**

**After Manchin's talks with Biden stalled last December on the more
sweeping Democratic bill known as Build Back Better, Manchin recalled
Biden telling him: "Joe, it's not going to help for me to be involved in
this ... if you can do anything, good. If not, I understand."**

**"You know, as an old senator, he understands things are a little rough
at times," Manchin said. In a statement[[, Biden thanked Manchin and
Schumer for their work and described the deal as "the action the
American people have been waiting for."]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**Following Manchin's stated interest in limiting a party-line domestic
policy bill to health care and lowering prescription drug prices without
more information about inflation, Democrats were expecting to pursue a
bill that did not include climate or energy provisions. But Manchin and
Schumer quietly continued negotiating behind the scenes, mostly through
staff, leading to the surprise breakthrough while Manchin was sidelined
with Covid.**

**"[[There was no pressure]{.underline}]{.mark}. The easiest thing for
me to do is walk away and do nothing \... just stay away," [[Manchin
said]{.underline}]{.mark}. "That was not the case, because it was not
the right thing."**

**The agreement mirrors roughly what Manchin first laid out earlier this
year as his goals for the party-line bill, albeit with a more limited
tax title. Democrats plan to raise revenues for the legislation by
imposing a 15 percent corporate minimum tax, increasing IRS enforcement,
reducing drug prices and closing the so-called carried interest
loophole.**

**Notably, [[the legislation also extends
A]{.underline}]{.mark}ffordable [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}are
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ct [subsidies through the 2024
election]{.underline} and the first term of Biden's presidency, taking
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} big political [[headache off the table for
Democrats]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Manchin]{.underline}]{.mark} said that
"helps people because you just can't throw \[increases\] on them during
inflammatory times like this."**

**It does not include surtaxes on people making more than \$10 million a
year, ending a push by most Democrats to impose higher rates on the
wealthy; nor does it include a global tax deal. Manchin said the bill in
theory should be bipartisan but he believed Republicans would never
touch the tax code for corporations.**

**He [[also saw this moment as the]{.underline}]{.mark} last, [[best
opportunity for Democrats given]{.underline}]{.mark} the uncertainty
ahead of the [[midterms.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**"In any other environment \[than\] what we have right now, this would
be a bipartisan bill. I really believe that. This is the only vehicle I
have to work with right now," Manchin said. "We don't know what the
future will bring. But all indications, might be a little bit of a
shake-up. And that changes the dynamics of getting something done," he
added.**

**Another twist: Manchin said the final deal does not leave out new
incentives for electric vehicles, which he'd resisted in what became a
major sticking point in the negotiations. Manchin said the bill gives
incentives to make new car batteries in America "and not only be able to
assemble them, but be able to extract the minerals that we need,
critical minerals, in North America."**

**Schumer held a call Wednesday evening with committee chairs who have
jurisdiction over climate as well as senators focused on the issue. The
deal with Manchin includes a methane fee as well as a \$4,000 tax credit
for the purchase of used electric vehicles, according to two Democrats
familiar with the matter.**

**The bill also includes efforts to make fossil fuels cleaner, Manchin
said, as well as to increase production to help American allies amid
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has limited European fuel
supplies.**

**Sinema learned of the deal on Wednesday afternoon and had no immediate
comment. When asked about the agreement, Majority Whip Dick Durbin
(D-Ill.) replied: "That's news to me." Others declined to comment,
saying they had yet to see the details. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.)
said his "first clue" was Manchin's press release.**

**"There were hints, but nobody wanted to say anything until it was
landed," said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). "But it's good that it's
landed."**

**After months of rocky negotiations --- and the expectation from many
that any hope of reaching a climate deal with Manchin was gone ---
Democrats were buoyant Wednesday afternoon, even as the details of the
deal had yet to be released. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) put it this
way: "At least we're using the word 'climate.' It's a good start."**

**How the bill plays in the House will also be important. [[Progressives
were elated]{.underline}]{.mark}, with Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.)
[[calling it a "really important victory."]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**And moderate Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), who made state and local
tax relief his red line, was noncommittal about whether he'd dig in even
as his priority was left out of the bill: "Until I see specifics it's
hard to know."**

**Senate Republicans attacked Manchin for agreeing to a deal with
Schumer after lauding him for stopping several iterations of the
party-line legislation. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in a statement
he couldn't believe Manchin was "agreeing to a massive tax increase in
the name of climate change when our economy is in a recession."**

**[[Manchin said he understands that the legislation will divide
Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} and potentially reshape his reputation.
[[Instead of the man who obstructed Biden's agenda]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[Manchin is now the Democrat]{.mark}]{.underline} from deep-red West
Virginia [[who cut a major climate change deal three months before an
election]{.underline}]{.mark}.**

**"I'm sure all the pundits will come out \[from\] different directions
now, but I'm not worried about me," Manchin said. "I don't think you
could be attacked any more than I've been attacked for a year. So, I
don't know what else they could do to me."**

Primary Shakeup",
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/24/drug-prices/> -
Haoyou

[Oregon Rep. Kurt Schrader has long served as a reliable ally of the
pharmaceutical industry inside an increasingly hostile Democratic
Party.]{.underline}

[As scores of House colleagues called for legislation that would allow
Medicare to negotiate the prices it pays those companies --- which
promised to drive down costs at the pharmacy counter but decimate the
U.S. drug industry's roughly \$550 billion in yearly revenue ---
Schrader was among a small handful of Democrats who pushed back, and he
played a key role last year in narrowing his party's
efforts.]{.underline}

[Now [Schrader's]{.mark} political [career is hanging by a]{.mark}
gossamer [thread]{.mark} [after]{.mark} a primary opponent, Jamie
[McLeod-Skinner, made]{.mark} the congressman's [opposition to]{.mark}
the [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s']{.mark} marquee [drug]{.mark}-pricing [bill a
central issue]{.mark} in her campaign. [His potential loss has rekindled
interest]{.mark} on Capitol Hill [in pushing through]{.mark}
prescription [drug legislation before]{.mark} the [midterm]{.mark}
election[s]{.mark}, when [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s are at risk of
losing]{.mark} [their]{.mark} congressional [majorities]{.mark} and any
chance at the sort of aggressive policy they have promised in their
campaigns since at least 2006.]{.underline}

["It is a wake-up call across the country on the importance of taking
steps to hold down the cost of medicine," said Sen. Ron
Wyden]{.underline} (D), a fellow Oregonian, a longtime advocate for
Medicare drug negotiation and the chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee.

[[The talk has been]{.mark} further [fueled by
Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s']{.mark} [urgency to pass
legislation]{.mark}]{.underline} --- any legislation --- [[that can
address rising]{.mark} consumer [prices]{.mark}, as well as recent
comments from Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), who played the leading
role last year in derailing Build Back Better, the Democratic megabill
that was set to include drug-pricing legislation alongside climate, tax,
child care and numerous other provisions.]{.underline}

Mostly dead or slightly alive? Democrats don't yet know if Build Back
Better can be revived.

While [[Manchin]{.underline}]{.mark} has repeatedly declared Build Back
Better dead since pulling the plug back in December, he [has [insisted
he is]{.mark} still [open to legislation dealing with]{.mark}
prescription [drug prices]{.mark}. In a brief interview last week, he
said [drug pricing would be "the easy lift" in any package]{.mark} that
comes together [in the coming months.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Appearing on Monday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,
[Manchin said he saw drug-pricing legislation as a centerpiece of any
potential Democratic bill, alongside provisions on inflation and
energy.]{.underline}

[But it is Schrader's likely loss that has lit a fire under some
Democrats who are anxious that it won't just be Democratic voters who
punish them at that ballot box this year for not fulfilling one of their
central promises.]{.underline}

[[Interviews]{.mark} with key Democrats [revealed a]{.mark} growing
sense [of desperation that action is necessary]{.mark} on drug prices,
[especially as inflation continues]{.mark} to weigh on the U.S. economy
and Democrats' hopes of salvaging their majorities in
November.]{.underline} A group of 20 endangered swing-district House
Democrats all but begged Wyden and Senate Majority Leader Charles E.
Schumer (D-N.Y.) to pass legislation in a letter this week.

"Just like you, we were sent to Washington on the promise that we'd
tackle big issues and work to improve the lives of those we represent,"
they wrote. "And what issue do we hear about at every town hall? At
every event? The price of prescription drugs."

While many Democrats, including Wyden, hesitated to single out
Schrader's actions, they said his election shows voters are frustrated
with the inaction --- and willing to punish those who appear to stand in
the way.

"We've pledged again and again to lift this absurd restriction that
keeps Medicare from negotiating to hold down the cost of medicine,"
Wyden said last week. "I've had a thousand town meetings, and the
opposition to negotiating lower prices of medicine must be in the
witness protection program, because I can't find them."

[Even the pharmaceutical industry's critics acknowledge it isn't
Schrader's fault that drug-pricing legislation was not enacted. In fact,
he was part of a group of moderate Democrats who struck a deal with more
liberal colleagues last November to advance a compromise --- one that
would allow the federal government to negotiate with drug companies, but
only on a limited set of drugs.]{.underline}

Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), who worked closely with Schrader as a
leader of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition, declined to comment on a
circumstances surrounding Schrader's race. But she said that those on
the left flank of the party had "mischaracterized" his views.

[[Last year]{.mark}, Schrader was among [a small group of
Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} who [refused to advance the]{.mark}
drug-pricing [bill]{.mark} endorsed by House leadership, the Lower Drug
Costs Now Act]{.underline} --- at one point refusing to advance it in a
key Energy and Commerce Committee vote. [That opposition, as well
as]{.underline} [Senate [opposition from]{.mark} Sen. Kyrsten

WASHINGTON (AP) --- President Joe [Biden hailed a nascent Democratic
package of climate, health care and tax initiatives as "a giant step
forward" for the country Thursday as congressional leaders began nailing
down votes for a campaign-season bill they've cast as a boon for voters
struggling with inflation.]{.underline}

A day after Senate Majority Leader Chuck [[Schumer
and]{.underline}]{.mark} conservative Sen. Joe [[Manchin]{.mark} stunned
Washington by [resurrect]{.mark}ing]{.underline} components of a
[[compromise]{.underline}]{.mark} many thought dead, [early signs were
encouraging for the party.]{.underline}

After Schumer briefed Democratic senators on the 725-page measure, Sen.
Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said [lawmakers' reaction has been "uniformly
positive."]{.underline} And [[Reps]{.mark}.]{.underline} Tom
[Suozzi]{.underline}, D-N.Y., [and]{.underline} Tom
[Malinowski]{.underline}, D-N.J., [[suggested they could back the
measure even though it lacks higher]{.mark} federal [tax
deductions]{.mark} for state and local taxes that they've championed in
the past.]{.underline}

"We're taking a giant step forward as a nation,"
[[Biden]{.mark}]{.underline} said at the White House. In a message to
lawmakers, he [[called it a compromise that was "the strongest bill you
can pass" to address health care, climate, energy and]{.mark} families'
[living costs.]{.mark}]{.underline} "Pass it, pass it for the American
people."

The measure's phoenix-like rebirth came Wednesday, when Manchin
unexpectedly agreed to add tax, energy and environment provisions to a
plan he'd earlier said he wanted limited, for now, to prescription drug
price curbs and health care assistance. He told reporters Thursday that
his talks with Schumer had continued and disputed that he'd reversed
himself.

"I've never been in reverse in my lifetime and I never walked away,"
Manchin, who has COVID-19 and has stayed away from the Capitol, said in
a conference call. He also described what he said he's endured during
the past year, when he repeatedly forced Biden and top Democrats to
whittle down what was initially a \$3.5 trillion proposal.

"No one in their right mind would go through all the protest,
harassments" that he faced, [[Manchin said]{.underline}]{.mark}, after
he scuttled a roughly \$2 trillion version that the House had passed
after he insisted on cuts. He said Democrats "turned the dogs loose" on
him two weeks ago after he told Schumer that he wanted a measure limited
to health care this month because of inflation fears.

He said [[he was]{.mark} now [backing]{.mark} the expanded [bill
"because I know I'm not adding to inflation]{.mark}"]{.underline} with
the agreement. And he acknowledged that he wants the Mountain Valley
Pipeline, which will deliver natural gas from West Virginia to Virginia,
to be at "the top of the heap" under permitting procedures that Biden
and congressional leaders have pledged to move through Congress this
fall.

[Loose ends remain in a 50-50 Senate where [support from every
Dem]{.mark}ocrat --- plus Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking
vote --- [are needed to overcome unanimous Republican opposition]{.mark}
that seems preordained.]{.underline} Sen. Kyrsten
[[Sinema]{.underline}]{.mark}, D-Ariz., [who [last year joined Manchin
in forcing cuts]{.mark} and changes [in]{.mark} larger versions of [the
plan,]{.mark} [declined to tell]{.mark} reporters [her
stance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In the narrowly divided House, [Democrats can lose no more than four
votes and prevail.]{.underline} Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., a leader
of the centrist House Blue Dog Coalition, said she wouldn't yet comment
on her views. ["I don't think there's anybody wildly
pleased,"]{.underline} [said]{.underline} No. 2 House Democratic leader
Steny [Hoyer]{.underline} of Maryland. "But I think [the overwhelming
majority think the things that are in it are good things."]{.underline}

Overall, the emerging package would raise \$739 billion over a decade
from higher taxes on huge corporations and hedge fund owners, beefed up
IRS tax collections and lower federal costs from trimming pharmaceutical
prices. It would spend \$369 billion on energy and climate change
initiatives, what analysts and environmentalists called the largest
federal investment ever on clean energy. Another \$64 billion would be
to extend health insurance subsidies for three years, leaving \$306
billion for a modest swipe at massive federal deficits.

The measure is markedly less ambitious than the \$3.5 trillion version
that stumbled, shrank and ultimately died in Congress last year, largely
due to Manchin's opposition. The new bill lacks many of the party's
initial goals including funds for a more generous child tax credit, paid
family leave, expanded Medicare benefits and health care aid for poor
families in the dozen states --- mostly Republican and in the South ---
that refused to expand Medicaid under President Barack Obama's health
care law.

Even so, the surprise agreement moves Biden and Democrats to the edge of
claiming victory on top priorities like addressing global warming and
easing consumers' health care costs, and boosting levies on the affluent
to pay for it.

"It's bigger than nothing," said Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., who with other
progressives fought vainly last year against Manchin's efforts to trim
the proposal. After Manchin prevailed, "A lot of us thought this was
done unless we had more Senate seats, and the fact that we're able to
still get something quite substantial done is impressive."

Rep. Kurt [Schrader]{.underline}, D-Ore., another of his party's more
conservative lawmakers, [called the bill's prescription drug provisions
"the most important piece of legislation we'll vote on in this
Congress"]{.underline} besides last fall's infrastructure measure.

As leaders sold the plan to their members, the government reported that
the economy had constricted for a second straight quarter. Worries that
a recession was coming only intensified concerns over the nation's worst
bout with inflation since the 1980s.

Both parties know inflation and economic anxiety is on top of voters'
minds. With Republicans expected to win control of the House and perhaps
the Senate too, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., turned
his fire on Democrats' measure.

"Our colleagues across the aisle have already completely lost Americans'
trust on the economy, before this reckless taxing and spending spree.
Apparently they want to see how much farther they can fall," he said.

The bill would create tax credits for low- and middle-income buyers of
electric vehicles, plus grants and tax breaks to spur clean energy
technology and reduce carbon emissions.

Medicare would begin negotiating for the pharmaceuticals it buys,
prescription price increases would be limited and Medicare
beneficiaries' out-of-pocket drug costs would be capped at \$2,000
annually.

[Sen. Joe [Manchin]{.mark}, D-W.Va., [delivered a serious blow to
ongoing]{.mark} Senate [negotiations]{.mark} for a Democratic budget
package, telling Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Thursday that
[**he will not support** a bill that includes **climate or tax
provisions**]{.mark} --- leaving **slimmed-down legislation** focused

[If Schumer wanted to move forward immediately, Manchin told West
Virginia radio host Hoppy Kercheval, a much slimmer bill on health care
was his best option.]{.underline}

[\"He took that as \'no,\' I guess,\" Manchin said.]{.underline}

[Manchin also said he saw progress on the climate side of the talks,
despite disagreements about the magnitude of fossil fuel cuts, and he
wanted to look at passing a bill in September. He added he did not want
to stop future negotiations.]{.underline}

[\"I would not put my staff through this --- I would not put myself
through this --- if I wasn\'t sincere about trying to find a pathway
forward to do something that\'s good for our country,\" he
said.]{.underline}

[Earlier this week, the conservative Democrat had expressed worries
about increasing government spending, and putting more dollars into the
economy, as the United States faces its worst inflation in
decades.]{.underline}

[\"While Washington seems to now understand this reality, it is time for
us to work together to get unnecessary spending under control, produce
more energy at home and take more active and serious steps to address
this record inflation that now poses a clear and present danger to our

inflation in 40 years.]{.underline}

[\"No matter what spending aspirations some in Congress may have, [it is

[The announcement suggested that [Democrats could move]{.mark} in the
coming days [to salvage a major piece of their]{.mark} domestic
[agenda]{.mark}, which only weeks ago appeared doomed given Mr.
Manchin's refusal to quickly sign on.]{.underline} Top
Democrats released legislation on Wednesday evening, aiming for votes as
early as next week.

[["This is the action the American people have been waiting
for,"]{.mark} Mr. [Biden said]{.mark} in a statement, calling on both
chambers to quickly pass the measure.]{.underline} "This addresses the
problems of today --- high health care costs and overall inflation ---
as well as investments in our energy security for the future."

It was not clear what had changed Mr. Manchin's mind since he said not
even two weeks ago that he could not support such a package until he saw
inflation numbers for July, which are not scheduled to be issued for two
more weeks. But quiet negotiations had resumed between Mr. Manchin, Mr.
Schumer and their staffs in recent days, according to a person familiar
with the talks.

The abrupt announcement came only hours after passage of a huge
industrial policy bill aimed at bolstering American competitiveness with
China that Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the
minority leader, had said he would never support as long as Democrats
continued their efforts to push through their marquee domestic policy
bill over G.O.P. opposition[. But that legislation still needs to clear
the House, and Republican leaders in that chamber said they would
instruct their ranks to oppose it after news of the deal.]{.underline}

[[With the Senate divided]{.mark} 50 to 50 and Republicans uniformly
opposed, [Democrats need unanimous support]{.mark} within their party
and the tiebreaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris to pass the
plan under special rules that shield certain budget bills from a
filibuster.]{.underline} Mr. Manchin's resistance has been the primary
obstacle to doing so all along, handing him effective veto power over
its contents --- and the final say over whether any measure could pass
the Senate.

[products]{.mark}]{.underline}. Lawrence [Summers]{.mark}, the former

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Delay

#### The bill is time-sensitive and has to pass urgently. The plan delays the bill from passing.

[[The deal]{.underline}]{.mark} crafted by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.)
and Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) [would [result in
historic investments in combating climate change]{.mark}]{.underline} if
the package is signed into law by President Biden.

[[Climate activists]{.underline}]{.mark}, who earlier this month were in
despair after Manchin seemingly torpedoed an earlier deal, [generally
have [praise]{.mark}d [the]{.mark} new [agreement]{.mark} [as a
meaningful step]{.mark} in protecting the planet --- [even if it would
still leave plenty of more work to do]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"It's going to be the largest climate investment in American history by
far," Leah Stokes, an environmental politics professor at the University
of California, Santa Barbara, told The Hill.

[The bill also comes as [Democrats have little time to spare]{.mark}.
[With Republicans]{.mark} favored to [win back the House majority in the
fall]{.mark}, [losing an opportunity to pass meaningful climate
legislation with Democrats]{.mark} in the White House and holding power
in the House and Senate [would be devastating]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, [[scientists]{.mark} have [warned]{.mark} that [time is
limited]{.mark} for the world [to get global climate change under
control]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"[[It's a **make-or-break moment** for a livable
planet]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[we have to get this bill over the
finish line]{.underline}]{.mark}," Stokes added.

Start Date in the Air as Senators Await Ruling,"

The Senate's planned departure date next week is in question, as
[[Democrats push to pass]{.mark} a tax, climate, and health care
[bill]{.mark} through the budget reconciliation process before leaving
town until September.]{.underline}

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) told fellow
[[Democrats]{.underline}]{.mark} at a caucus meeting Thursday to
[[prepare to work through next weekend]{.underline}]{.mark}, according
to Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). [[That would cancel]{.mark} at least [the
first]{.mark} couple of [days of August recess]{.mark} --- not that
[Democrats]{.mark}, who [are enthusiastic about]{.mark}
[achieving]{.mark} more of President Joe [Biden's agenda]{.mark}, were
complaining.]{.underline}

["[Congress should stay in session]{.mark} as long as it takes [to get
this bill to]{.mark} **President** [Biden]{.mark}'s desk,"]{.underline}
Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) said.

The exact timing for passing the bill (H.R. 5376) is being driven by the
factors necessary to use the extensive process, which requires only a
simple majority, and by potential Covid-19 infections, which hit the
Democratic caucus again Thursday when Majority Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.)
announced he'd tested positive.

[[Senators]{.mark} are [aim]{.mark}ing [for a shorter ruling
timeline]{.mark} [on the]{.mark} package's expansive new
[provisions]{.mark}. Manchin said [negotiators aimed to get text
finalized by Wednesday night]{.mark} to give the parliamentarian enough
time to comb through the bill and [for senators to approve it]{.mark}
[before]{.mark} **the** [Saturday]{.mark} of the first weekend [of
recess]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Schumer]{.underline}]{.mark} sounded optimistic about that timeline as
of Thursday afternoon.

"[I [expect the remaining work]{.mark} with the parliamentarian will [be
completed in the coming days]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [**[Senate]{.mark} will [vote
on]{.mark} this transformative [legislation ]{.mark}**[next
week]{.mark}]{.underline}," Schumer said at a news conference.

The clock started Wednesday night when Schumer submitted to **[[Senate
Parliamentarian]{.underline}]{.mark}** Elizabeth
**[[MacDonough]{.underline}]{.mark}** the text of the 725-page spending
and deficit-reduction package, which Schumer agreed to hours earlier
with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).

MacDonough [**[and her staff must pore over the details]{.mark}** to
make sure it comports with statutory rules]{.underline} that would allow
Democrats to approve the legislation without the support of Republicans
in the evenly divided chamber.

[**[Democrats are]{.mark}** still **[awaiting a
response]{.mark}**]{.underline} from MacDonough related [**[to
the]{.mark}** previously submitted **[drug]{.mark}** pricing
**[provisions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} That process has taken weeks as
Democratic staff went back-and-forth with MacDonough and Republican
staff over how the legislation complies with the rules.

Assuming Democrats can get all 50 members of the caucus to support the
bill, senators will have to endure a marathon session known as a
vote-a-rama, when any member can force a vote on amendments, before
sending the bill to the House.

When Democrats last passed a budget reconciliation bill (Public Law
117-2), senators voted for 12 straight hours, overnight, to dispense
with dozens of Republican amendments.

["I expect [**it's going to be** hectic next week]{.mark},"
**[Senate]{.mark}** Finance Chair Ron **[Wyden]{.mark}** (D-Ore.)
**[said]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Whatever the **[Senate]{.mark}** passes would **[need to be approved by
the House]{.mark}**, [**which is scheduled to leave for its** August
recess Friday**.**]{.mark}]{.underline} House members are expecting to
return for a short session in August for votes, but it's unclear when.

[**[A key date]{.mark}** to watch [**is** Aug. 9]{.mark}, **[when
Minnesota]{.mark}** **[holds]{.mark}** a special **[election]{.mark}**
to replace the late Jim Hagedorn (R). A **[Republican is favored to
win]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} **[once sworn in would]{.mark} shrink the
Democrats' margin. That would mean any more than three no votes from
their caucus could [sink the bill]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The difference might be more consequential for other legislation that
could also receive votes next month. House Democrats are continuing to
negotiate a package of public safety bills, including some that would
provide funding to police departments, and an assault weapons ban (H.R.
1808).

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Security Coop

#### NATO security cooperation [crashes]{.underline} into partisan infighting\-\--costs Biden PC, even without a vote in Congress. 

Matthew **Kendrick 21**, reporter at Morning Consult covering
geopolitics and foreign affairs, "Biden Says America Is Back. 2022 Will
Put That Premise to the Test," Morning Consult, 12-21-2021,
[**https://morningconsult.com/2021/12/21/global-look-ahead-2022/**](https://morningconsult.com/2021/12/21/global-look-ahead-2022/)

"The big question has been whether or not the Trump years were an
interregnum or a dangerous foreshadowing of things to come," said
Stewart M. Patrick, director of the International Institutions and
Global Governance program at the Council on Foreign Relations. "And
**[because of the complete breakdown of any bipartisanship in the
U.S.]{.underline}**, **[allies and partners are hedging]{.underline}**
their bets."

Europe: Trying to win without fighting

**[The [past several weeks]{.mark} of [high-stakes diplomacy]{.mark}
over the [Russian military buildup]{.mark} on its border with Ukraine
have been perhaps the premier example of how Washington
would]{.underline}** [like]{.underline} **[to conduct
diplomacy]{.underline}** with American allies. Biden orchestrated a
complex web of summits with the major NATO powers, the coalition's
easternmost members known as the Bucharest Nine and his Ukrainian and
Russian counterparts to impose a credible threat of sanctions that seem
to have taken the temperature down for the moment. **[However,
the]{.underline}** American **[[president]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[also]{.underline} **[[signaled]{.mark} there was a]{.underline}**
[[limit]{.underline} **[to the]{.underline}** [degree of
military]{.underline}]{.mark} [[commitment]{.underline} **[Washington
was prepared to shoulder]{.underline}**]{.mark} to deter Moscow, and
that he would be open to accommodation.

Paul B. Stares, director of CFR's Center for Preventive Action, said
"that sent alarm bells ringing that the U.S. really wasn't fully
committed to the security of states on NATO's front line, or might
compromise certain things in order to avoid war."

In addition to the Ukraine crisis, experts pointed to two more key areas
to watch that will have a "profound bearing" on European allies'
confidence in American security commitments: China's increasingly
assertive foreign policy and talks to resume the Iran nuclear accord.
With regard to China, where European powers see fewer direct threats and
more economic opportunities, Washington faces more challenges in lining
up a united front.

"Certain European countries share the administration's more hawkish
view, but others are really leery of getting involved in a confrontation
with China," said Patrick.

The recent kerfuffle over the canceled sale of French submarines to
Australia was a missed opportunity to move European and American
interests in Asia into greater alignment, according to experts
interviewed for this article. Multiple sources also noted that worries
about **[ongoing]{.underline}** [political gridlock]{.underline}
**[in]{.underline}** [Washington]{.underline} **[make]{.underline}**
[[Europe]{.underline}a]{.mark}n politicians [[wary]{.underline} **[of
putting]{.underline}** [all their eggs]{.underline} **[in]{.underline}**
[America's basket]{.underline}.]{.mark} After all, they might need to
trade with China if another U.S. president should echo Trump's
protectionist policies in the future.

[Political gridlock]{.underline} also [hampers progress]{.underline} on
the issue that is perhaps the greatest cause for concern: the seemingly
moribund talks to resume the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran.

"It's very difficult for the U.S. to make credible commitments that Iran
will believe, because the Republicans have said, flatly, they're going
to blow up everything that they can to block any restoration of the
nuclear agreement," said Justin Logan, a senior fellow at the Cato
Institute.

And because sanctions on Tehran are already among the tightest in the
world, it's not clear what credible options Washington might have to
prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons short of military action in
the eventuality that diplomacy fails, which experts agreed would not be
supported by the European powers. Stares said he worries that a nuclear
Iran could spur neighboring states to develop their own nuclear
deterrents, as it would be the fourth country to openly violate the
principles of nonproliferation.

Latin America: Will Biden put money where his mouth is?

Former Mexican Foreign Secretary Jorge Castañeda said the Biden
administration, like that of his predecessor, has focused on migration
at the expense of several pressing issues in Latin America, and he
doesn't think much of its premier program aiming to mitigate migration
in the region by raising private investment in Guatemala, Honduras and
El Salvador.

"If the private sector wanted to invest there, they would have already
done it," Castañeda said. "They wouldn't be waiting for Vice President
Harris to call and ask them for pledges."

The United States is scheduled to host the Summit of the Americas this
summer, and Castañeda thinks this would be the perfect forum to put
forth plans to address a series of issues alongside partners in Latin
America, including climate change, human rights, institutional
corruption, diplomatic normalization with Cuba and pathways to address
Venezuela's multiple crises.

Even if the administration remains focused almost exclusively on
migration, Castañeda said stale policy refrains need to be reassessed:
"Can you imagine somebody saying they were in favor of disorderly,
irregular and unsafe migration? Obviously not. It's silly, frankly, and
there's a lot of things that Biden could do, but he's so scared of the
electoral consequences that he won't."

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

India: A promising start to a long journey

In India, Biden found relations in a much better place than where he
left them as vice president, as New Delhi's fears of an increasingly
aggressive China led it to make major strides in deepening ties to the
other members of the so-called Quad --- Japan, Australia and the United
States --- after the defunct group, originally proposed in 2007, was
revived a decade later. However, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin
Rudd, who currently serves as president and CEO of Asia Society, a
global nonprofit, said the White House should keep in mind that it is
very far from achieving the level of cooperation and capability it would
like with New Delhi.

Observers looking to gauge the depth of the U.S.-India strategic
relationship as the next year unfolds should keep an eye on efforts from
the White House to enhance bilateral trust and Indian military might, as
well as New Delhi's receptiveness toward such overtures. However, such
receptiveness could only provide a limited sense of progress, Rudd
noted, with the real degree of improvement only measured in the context
of an actual conflict.

"If there was a crisis in the South China Sea tomorrow, what would Japan
do, what would Australia do and what would India do, militarily?" he
asked, adding that, for New Delhi, deployment to active-conflict zones
is "something currently at the outer reaches of the parameters of the
possible."

Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said India is
also "hedging against uncertainty about the U.S." and pursuing defense
arrangements with a number of states to better prepare against threats
like China. That's why observers shouldn't fail to note where India
deepens other bilateral relations, even with U.S. rivals, as exemplified
by the recent summit between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and
Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the Indian military's acquisition
of more Russian hardware.

In response to American complaints about this deal, Indian officials
have pointed out that increasing the country's defense capacity does not
harm shared interests. Madan added that not only does Moscow offer New
Delhi weapons that Washington can't or won't, but completely undoing
ties with Russia would also severely hamper the Indian military's
ability to maintain its existing stock of equipment and present a
credible deterrent to Beijing.

"It's not about poking the U.S. in the eye," she said, adding that New
Delhi has an interest in putting political "daylight between Russia and
China" as India seeks to avoid isolating Moscow and forcing the
formation of a Sino-Russian bloc.

Asia-Pacific: It's the (Chinese) economy, stupid

Experts agreed that the key factor in the course of the American
alliance system in Asia is the Chinese economy, which could give the
United States a unique opening given China's current market struggles.

"If ever there was a strategic opportunity for the United States to
re-enter the geoeconomic field, it's now, as the Chinese economy begins
to soften," said Rudd.

Neighboring powers need trade with China to support their economies, and
Beijing hopes to use this imperative to anchor regional influence over
the long term regardless of whatever steps Washington might take to draw
countries out of China's orbit. The experts we spoke to agreed that
Biden could seriously stymie China's gambit for economic dominance by
deepening commercial ties in the region, perhaps by creating or joining
a massive free trade pact among regional powers such as the new
iteration of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, created after the United
States walked away from a similar accord in early 2017. It's worth
mentioning that the purpose of the original TPP was, in part, to curb
China's economic advantages.

And it's about more than just money, said Weifeng Zhong, a senior
research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.
Signing trade agreements with states that feel caught between Beijing
and Washington gives the United States skin in the game, so to speak,
and signals commitment to the defense of allies more effectively than
rhetoric alone. Zhong even suggested an American trade agreement with
the Taiwanese government could help deter an attack from the mainland.

**[The]{.underline}** [[question]{.underline}]{.mark}, in Asia as

[[A]{.mark} more [drawn-out process]{.mark} to bring the troops home

[costs of withdrawal]{.mark}. Already]{.underline} on Tuesday, nearly
[two dozen Republican lawmakers sent a letter]{.underline} to the White

### AT: public love NATO or NATO has bipartisan support

#### NATO support is [overwhelmingly partisan]{.underline}

Jonathan **Bernstein 22**, Former professor of political science at the
University of Texas at San Antonio and DePauw University, "Are
Republicans Turning Against NATO?" Washington Post, 4/7/22,
[**https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/are-republicans-turning-against-nato/2022/04/07/46c1e36e-b66f-11ec-8358-20aa16355fb4_story.html**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/are-republicans-turning-against-nato/2022/04/07/46c1e36e-b66f-11ec-8358-20aa16355fb4_story.html)

When it came to public policy, Donald Trump's presidency was marked by
repeated defeats whenever he attempted to take on Republican orthodoxy.
When he championed tax cuts, the party was right there with him. When he
urged massive spending for infrastructure, they ignored him. On several
foreign-policy questions, including Trump's antagonism toward NATO,
congressional Republicans actively opposed him.Those foreign-policy
issues reflected the enduring triumph of Dwight Eisenhower. Republicans
were always anti-communists. But **[before Ike, [conservatives
had]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[been isolationists, preferring that
the U.S. stay out of]{.mark} the world, and especially out of [long-term
alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Harry Truman had worked with
internationalist Republicans in Congress to commit the U.S. to the
United Nations, NATO, the Marshall Plan, and more, but the rank and file
was less than comfortable with all of that, and it wasn't at all clear
where a Republican president would take the party. In fact, Eisenhower
only narrowly won the Republican nomination in 1952, defeating the
conservative wing of a party that was desperate after losing five
consecutive presidential elections and happy to have a war hero leading
the ticket. Eisenhower's popular and effective two-term presidency moved
isolationism to the fringe. His vice president, Richard Nixon, followed
his lead during his own presidency. Even when conservatives fully took
control of the party with the election of Ronald Reagan, the old
isolationist impulse was reduced to occasional UN-bashing. There were
plenty of real differences on foreign policy between the parties during
the Cold War, but Ike's presidency put Republicans firmly on the side of
an active continuing role for the U.S. in world affairs, including
participation in a series of alliances and agreements. Indeed, that
commitment outlasted the Cold War. **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**
didn't care much about public policy when he was president. But he
**[[did undermine]{.underline}]{.mark}** this **[[internationalist
consensus]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even using the old "America First"
slogan from an isolationist (and anti-Semitic) movement from the 1930s.
And while he had little success actually implementing his foreign-policy
preferences --- as he was repeatedly rolled by Congress, the bureaucracy
and allied nations --- it's quite possible he could have the last laugh.
Earlier this week, an astonishing 63 **[[House Republicans opposed a
resolution supporting NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That's still not a
full third of the Republican conference, but it's not exactly a tiny
fringe, either. To be fair, some of those objecting claimed to oppose
the non-binding, symbolic resolution because of some of its specific
wording rather than because they opposed the alliance --- but **[quite a
few seem to be wary of the whole concept of an alliance of democracies
against authoritarianism]{.underline}**. **[These lawmakers
are]{.underline}** only **[reflecting where their party appears to be
heading]{.underline}**. In two recent polls, **[[strong minorities of
Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- 40% of respondents in one survey
--- **[[supported leaving the alliance
altogether]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If a Republican committed to the old
consensus wins the 2024 nomination and is elected president, I'd expect
all of that to dissipate pretty rapidly. Both parties will once again be
strong supporters of NATO in particular and of the general overarching
direction of U.S. foreign policy since the 1940s. But if Trump is
nominated, and especially if he wins the presidency, it's hard to see
the party working as hard to constrain his foreign-policy choices as it
once did. And if Democrats remain in the White House for another four
years (or more)? **[It's easy to imagine [partisan polarization
extend]{.mark}ing [in]{.mark}to [this area]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as it
has so many others, **[[with Republicans automatically opposing]{.mark}
whatever it is that Democratic presidents are doing --- including
[participation in the alliance]{.mark}s]{.underline}** that Eisenhower,
Nixon, Gerald Ford, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush all
strongly supported. Preventing that result would require strong,
responsible leadership from Republican politicians. I'm not optimistic
that will happen.

**[[Many steps remain]{.mark} before]{.underline}** Mr. **[Biden can
sign both bills into law]{.underline}** --- but his party has given
itself only a few weeks to complete them. **[The [infrastructure]{.mark}
bill [is written. But the House and Senate must agree
on]{.mark}]{.underline}** the spending [**[programs]{.underline}**,
**[revenue]{.underline}**]{.mark} increases
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** overall **[[cost]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of the larger bill, **[[balancing]{.mark} the desires of
[progressives]{.mark}]{.underline}** who see a generational chance to
expand government to address inequality and curb climate change **[[and
moderates]{.underline}]{.mark}** who have pushed for a smaller package
and resisted some of the tax proposals to pay for it. It is a timeline
reminiscent of what Republicans set for themselves in the fall of 2017,
when they rushed a nearly \$2 trillion package of tax cuts to President
Donald J. Trump's desk without a single Democratic vote. **[[Sticking to
it will require sustained support from]{.mark} administration
officials]{.underline}** both in and out of Washington. In the first
three weeks of August, Mr. **[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}** dispatched
cabinet members to 31 states to barnstorm for the infrastructure bill
and his broader economic agenda, with events in the districts of
moderate and progressive members of Congress, according to internal
documents obtained by The New York Times. His secretaries of
transportation, labor, interior, energy, commerce and agriculture sat
for dozens of local television and radio interviews to promote the
bills. Even with those efforts, **[[the initial clash
over]{.underline}]{.mark}** advancing **[[the
budget]{.underline}]{.mark}** this week **[[was resolved with a flurry
of calls from]{.underline}]{.mark}** Mr.
**[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}**, top White House officials and senior
Democrats to the competing factions in the House. Congressional leaders
say they have spent months laying the groundwork so that their party can
move quickly toward consensus. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California told
colleagues in a letter on Wednesday that "we have long had an eye to
having the infrastructure bill on the president's desk by the Oct. 1,"
the date when many provisions in the bipartisan package are slated to go
into effect. Committee leaders have been instructed to finish their work
by Sept. 15, and rank-and-file lawmakers have been told to make their
concerns and priorities known quickly as they maneuver through
substantive policy disagreements, including whether it should be as much
as \$3.5 trillion and the scope of Mr. Biden's proposed tax increases.
"I'm sure everybody's going to try their best," said Representative John
Yarmuth of Kentucky, the House Budget Committee chairman. "Some
committees will have it rougher than others." Senator Ron Wyden of
Oregon, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has been releasing
discussion drafts of proposals to fund the \$3.5 trillion budget
reconciliation spending --- the larger bill that Democrats plan to move
without any Republican support --- including raising taxes on high
earners and businesses. On Wednesday, he provided granular details of a
plan to increase taxes on the profits that multinational companies earn
and book overseas. "I'm encouraged by where we are," Mr. Wyden said in
an interview. Democratic leaders and the White House have pushed
analyses of their proposals that speak to core liberal priorities; on
Wednesday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader,
released a report suggesting the two bills combined would "put our
country on the path to meet President Biden's climate change goals of 80
percent clean electricity and 50 percent economywide carbon emission
reduction by 2030." White House economists released a detailed report
this week claiming the spending Mr. Biden supports, like universal
prekindergarten and subsidized child care, would expand the productive
capacity of the economy and help reduce price pressures in the future.
While Republicans are not expected to get on board with the larger
spending bill, they are still making their concerns known, labeling the
bill socialist and a spending spree and claiming it will stoke inflation
and drive jobs overseas. Mr. **[[Biden can pass the entire agenda now
with only Dem]{.mark}ocratic [votes, but the party's thin
majorities]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- **[including no room for even a
single defection]{.underline}** in the Senate --- **[[complicates the
task]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Ms. Pelosi said on Wednesday that the House
would "write a bill with the Senate, because there's no use our doing a
bill that is not going to pass the Senate, in the interest of getting
things done." As part of an agreement to secure the votes needed to
approve the \$3.5 trillion budget blueprint on Tuesday, Ms. Pelosi gave
centrist and conservative Democrats a commitment that she would only
take up a reconciliation package that had the support of all 50 Senate
Democrats and cleared the strict Senate rules that govern the fast-track
process. "I'm not here to pass messaging bills --- I'm here to pass
bills that will actually become law and help the American people," said
Representative Stephanie Murphy of Florida, one of the Democrats who
initially announced that she would not support advancing the budget, but
ultimately joined every Democrat in advancing it. For moderates, Ms.
Pelosi's commitment served to shield them from potentially tough votes
on provisions that the Senate may reject. It also signaled the

**[[The White House and]{.mark} [congressional Democrats are in advanced
talks on legislation]{.mark}]{.underline}** that aims **[[to fight
inflation,]{.mark} rein in the deficit and revive parts
of]{.underline}** President Joe **[Biden's]{.underline}** stalled
**[economic agenda]{.underline}**. The contours of a potential deal
remain under negotiation, but **[the package would likely include
capping the price of insulin \-- a key medicine for diabetics \-- and
federal investments in both clean energy and fossil
fuels]{.underline}**, according to people briefed on the talks. It would
also further reduce the budget deficit and boost taxes on the wealthy,
corporations or both, they said. **[[An agreement could come together as
soon as next week]{.underline}]{.mark}**, two people said, though others
were more cautious, noting many details remain to be resolved. Climate
provisions are a particularly tricky area, and differences could still
scotch a deal, one person said. The people familiar with the talks asked
not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the negotiations, in
which Senator Joe **[[Manchin]{.underline}]{.mark}** of West Virginia
[**[plays a central role]{.underline}**. **[The president has hinted at
a coming agreement]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, framing the legislation
primarily as a move to cool consumer-price increases]{.underline}**,
which unexpectedly accelerated to an annual 8.6% in May. Not Everything
"I believe **[[I have the votes to do a number of things," Biden
said]{.underline}]{.mark}** Thursday in an interview with the Associated
Press, citing capping insulin costs as an example. "We can reduce it to
35 bucks a month and get it done. We have the votes to do it. We're
going to get that done. I can't get it all done." **[Democrats are
desperate for a policy response to inflation]{.underline}**, which is at
a four-decade high and, unless curbed, is all but certain to cost them
control of the House, Senate or both in November's midterm elections.
Gasoline, a critical component of the American household budget, costs
\$5 a gallon on average nationwide, according to the AAA motor club, and
hit a record earlier this month. Seeking to quell the surge in living
costs, the Federal Reserve accelerated its monetary-tightening campaign
this week, executing the biggest interest-rate hike since 1994. The
moves have driven fresh losses on Wall Street and increased the odds of
a recession that would only compound Biden's political troubles. Biden
ordered a record release from the nation's oil reserves earlier this
year to try to curb gasoline prices, but to little effect. Now, he's
looking to help households save money on everyday needs like drugs,
utilities and internet access, and by cutting the government's budget
deficit, which reached a record \$3.13 trillion in fiscal 2020, during
the pandemic. **[The president sought to cut drug prices and raise taxes
on the wealthy in last year's]{.underline}** economic plan, called
**[Build Back Better, which Manchin killed]{.underline}** in December by
saying he'd vote against it. Democrats need all 50 of their Senate
caucus members to pass legislation in the 100-seat chamber under the
so-called budget-reconciliation process, which can bypass a Republican
filibuster. The White House for months has refused to publicly comment
on any talks with Manchin. The West Virginia senator bristled at White
House statements late last year as he, other Democrats and the
president's aides negotiated. The relationship between the White House
and Manchin was so damaged in the aftermath of that chapter that some
White House officials still avoid saying his name aloud. Other Elements
"**[[The president remains engaged with Congress. This is an important
part of his economic agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Cecilia Rouse,
chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said Friday at
the White House. Along with the new legislation, Biden has recently
touted a provision of the infrastructure law enacted last year that
offers full rebates for some home-internet plans for low-income
households. He's also urged Congress to pass separate legislation that
would encourage domestic manufacturing of semiconductors to help ease
global shortages that have contributed to rising prices for cars and
consumer electronics. Together, he argues the measures would provide
Americans a counterbalance for higher food and gasoline prices. The
administration is also clamoring for new Covid funding from Congress,
but as of now there are no plans to roll that into any reconciliation
deal, two of the people said. Senate Duo **[[Biden
met]{.underline}]{.mark}** Wednesday [with]{.mark} Senate Majority
Leader Chuck **[[Schumer and]{.underline}]{.mark}** House Speaker Nancy
**[[Pelosi]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with the trio **[[discussing next
steps]{.mark} on a fresh bill to pass through the reconciliation
process. [The White House called the measure their "shared agenda of
tackling inflation]{.mark} and lowering prices and transitioning from a
historic economic recovery to stable, steady growth"]{.underline}** in a
statement on the meeting. The talks have largely narrowed to two men:
Schumer and Manchin. The basis for their discussions is legislation the
House passed last year that would raise federal revenue by \$1.5
trillion over a decade, one person said. White House spokespeople didn't
immediately respond to a request for comment on the talks. A person
familiar with **[[Manchin's]{.underline}]{.mark}** thinking said he is
**[[continuing to negotiate]{.mark} with Schumer]{.underline}**, and
hasn't set a July 4 deadline for reaching a deal. The person said energy
and climate is just one of the issues still being worked on. The House
bill included a surtax on wealthy Americans, expanded levies on
investments, had a 15% minimum rate for corporations and a tax on stock
buybacks. Savings in drug costs could push so-called pay-fors in the
bill to \$1.8 trillion over a decade. Manchin has insisted that at least
half of the new tax revenue in the bill go to reducing the deficit.
Energy Components Senator Kyrsten Sinema, however, has signaled
objections to many tax increases, leaving unclear which revenue measures
might make a final agreement. The Arizona Democrat this week said she's
focused on talks on new gun-safety legislation. Energy provisions remain
among the sticking points in the negotiations on the reconciliation
bill, with Manchin \-- whose state still produces much of the nation's
coal supply \-- advocating for fossil-fuel suppliers.
**[[Proponents]{.mark} of the legislation [are aiming for a deal]{.mark}
soon that can pass [before members]{.mark} of Congress [leave for
their]{.mark} annual [August recess.]{.mark} ]{.underline}**

WASHINGTON (AP) --- **[[Democrats are going to hold onto the House after
November's midterm elections]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They will pick up
as many as four seats in the Senate, expanding their majority and
Overcoming internal dissent that has helped stifle their agenda. **[[As
the challenges confronting President Joe Biden intensify, his
predictions of a rosy political future for the Democratic Party are
growing bolder]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The assessments, delivered in
speeches, fundraisers and conversations with friends and allies, seem at
odds with a country that he acknowledged this week was "really, really
down," burdened by a pandemic, surging gas prices and spiking
inflation[. **[Biden's hopeful outlook tracks with a sense of optimism
that has coursed through his nearly five-decade career and was at the
center of his 2020 presidential campaign]{.underline}**]{.mark}, which
he said was built around restoring the "soul of America." In a lengthy
Oval Office interview with The Associated Press on Thursday[, **[Biden
said part of his job as president is to "be
confident."]{.underline}**]{.mark} "Because I am confident," he said.
"[**[We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the
second quarter of the 21st century]{.underline}**.]{.mark} That's not
hyperbole. That's a fact." While presidents often try to emphasize the
positive, there is a risk in this moment that Biden contributes to a
dissonance between Washington and people across the country who are
confronting genuine and growing economic pain. Few of Biden's closest
political advisers are as bullish about the party's prospects as the
president. In interviews with a half-dozen people in and close to the
White House, there is a broad sense that Democrats will lose control of
Congress and that many of the party's leading candidates in down-ballot
races and contests for governor will be defeated, with Biden unable to
offer much help. The seeming disconnect between Biden's view and the
political reality has some in the party worried the White House has not
fully grasped just how bad this election year may be for Democrats. "I
don't expect any president to go out and say, 'You know what, 'We're
going to lose the next election,'" said Will Marshall, president and
founder of the Progressive Policy Institute, which is in regular contact
with the White House's policy team. What might serve Biden well instead,
Marshall said, would be "a sober sense of, 'Look, we're probably in for
a rough night in November and our strategy should be to remind the
country what's at stake.'" The White House is hardly ignoring the
problem. After years in which Democrats have operated in political
silos, there is a greater focus on marshaling resources. Jen O'Malley
Dillon, Biden's 2020 campaign manager who now serves as one of his
deputy chiefs of staff, runs the political team from the West Wing along
with Emmy Ruiz, a longtime Texas-based Democratic political consultant.
O'Malley Dillon coordinates strategy among the White House, the
Democratic National Committee and an array of outside party groups.
Cedric Richmond, a former Louisiana congressman who co-chaired Biden's
2020 campaign and was one of his closest White House advisers, left for
a job with the DNC in April. He characterized the move as underscoring
the administration's full grasp of the importance of the midterms. "We
understand that you cannot govern if you can't win," Richmond said in an
interview. "We are treating it with that sense of urgency." The
president's political message is being honed by Mike Donilon, a longtime
Biden aide who is a protector of Biden's public image, and veteran party
strategist Anita Dunn, who is returning to the White House for a second
stint. Richmond praised Dunn's political instincts and said he believes
she will team with O'Malley Dillion, White House chief of staff Ron
Klain and others to promote messaging that many in their own party may
underestimate[. **["If I had a penny for every time Democrats counted
Joe Biden or Kamala Harris out, I'd be independently
wealthy,"]{.underline}**]{.mark} Richmond said. Biden turned to Dunn
during an especially low political moment in February 2020, giving her
broad control of his then-cash strapped presidential campaign as it
appeared on the brink of collapse after a disastrous fourth-place
showing in the Iowa caucus. Barely a week later, Biden left New
Hampshire before its primary polls had even closed, ultimately finishing
fifth. But he took second in Nevada, won South Carolina handily and saw
the Democratic establishment rally around him at breakneck speed in mere
days after that. O'Malley Dillon then joined the campaign and oversaw
Biden's general election victory. A similar reversal of political
fortune may be necessary now. But where White House officials last year
harbored hopes that voters could be convinced of Biden's accomplishments
and reverse their dismal outlook on the national direction, aides now
acknowledge that such an uphill battle is no longer worth fighting.
Instead, **[[they have pushed the president to be more open about his
own frustrations --- particularly on inflation --- to show voters that
he shares their concerns and to cast Republicans and their policies as
obstacles to addressing these issues.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Though he
has increasingly expressed anger about inflation[, **[Biden has publicly
betrayed few concerns about his party's fortunes this fall. opting
instead for relentlessly positivity]{.underline}**.]{.mark} "I think
there are at least four seats that are up for grabs that we could pick
up in the Senate," the president told a recent gathering of donors in
Maryland. "And we're going to keep the House." Biden meant Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, with potential longer shots in North
Carolina or Florida possibly representing No. 4. Some aides admit that
assessment is too optimistic. They say the president is simply seeking
to fire up his base with such predictions. One openly laughed when asked
if it was possible that Democrats could pick up four Senate seats. The
party's chances of maintaining House control may be bleaker. Still, Tim
Persico, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, which is charged with defending the party's narrow majority,
said Biden remains an asset. **[["We love when the president is speaking
to the country,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** Persico said. **["[There'll
always be frustrations. I totally get that. But I think he's his own
best messenger."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

## Climate Impact

### Climate O/V (short)

#### The bill passes but Biden needs PC and time that the plan saps, preventing the bill from solving climate change and extinction. 

#### Weigh magnitude first -- no other impact matters if we stop existing. Climate change causes societal collapse that kills the entire planet, plus structural impacts that happen now. 

#### Disad turns the case\-\--{xxx}

### Climate O/V (long)

#### The bill will pass with the Manchin compromise but Biden still needs to convince Sinema before the August recess. The plan delays and saps Biden's already drained PC. That's Fram and Jacobs. The IRA invests billions into clean energy and climate-friendly ag, boosting US credibility and preventing catastrophic climate change. That's Stephanie. 

#### We outweigh on all fronts and you should weigh magnitude first. No other impact matters if it threatens existence and our ability to solve. Climate change is a threat multiplier that causes a laundry list of impacts including biodiversity loss, food and water shortages, and damage to infrastructure, all leading to societal collapse and extinction. Even without extinction, current impacts like oil fields on public lands and disparate health impacts outweigh on probability and timeframe.

threat' But Stops Short of Declaring an Emergency", Fortune,
<https://fortune.com/2022/07/20/joe-biden-climate-change-existential-threat-emergency/>,
AP.)

Provisions Biden unveiled Wednesday include moving to expand wind power
generation and the availability of efficient home cooling systems, as
well as allocating emergency funding for infrastructure and projects
like cooling stations in places facing extreme heat. 

But with an eye toward retaining Manchin's support for some measures,
Biden held back on declaring a formal climate emergency---a move that
would unlock broad new powers to develop clean power while restricting
the extraction and export of fossil fuels. He simply called warming an
emergency. 

[**["Climate change is an existential threat," Biden said]{.mark}** at a
former coal-fired power plant in Massachusetts that's being re-purposed
to support wind power generation. ]{.underline}

["Since Congress is not acting as it should---and these guys here are
but we're not getting many Republican votes---[**this is an emergency,
an emergency, and I will look at it that way**,]{.mark}" he
said.]{.underline}

The president is under pressure to meet his campaign promises of
aggressive action against climate change without also alienating
Manchin, a moderate Democrat whose vote is critical in the evenly
divided Senate. The West Virginia lawmaker represents a state rich in
coal and natural gas and has drawn much of his own wealth from the coal
industry.

The administration hopes to retain Manchin's support for an important
health-care bill that would lower costs for both prescription drugs and
Obamacare insurance plans before midterm elections in November. White
House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy downplayed Manchin's impact
on the rollout. 

"I do not know what Congress is anticipating now, or any one senator,
but the idea that the president is initiating here is to acknowledge the
challenge," McCarthy told reporters on Air Force One.

White House officials ruled out declaring a formal emergency this week.
But it remains under consideration, and Biden hinted that he would soon
make the move official.

[["**Climate change is an emergency**]{.mark}," he said. "And in the
coming weeks **[I'm going to use the power I have as president to turn
these words into formal, official government actions through the
appropriate proclamations, executive orders and regulatory powers that a

**[[1. Wildfires burn longer and wider]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Larger fires in hot, dry years

Wildfires have always been a natural part of life in the western United
States. However, as this region grows hotter and drier, wildfires are
growing in size, ferocity, and speed.

In recent years, [[California has become ground zero for meteorological
turmoil]{.mark}. With record dry, hot conditions across the state,
seasonal high winds (known as Diablo in Northern California and Santa
Ana in the southern part of the state) caused [destructive wildfires to
grow and spread at an unprecedented rate.]{.mark}]{.underline}

California wildfires burned [more than 4 million
acres](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/) in 2020 --- an area
larger than Connecticut --- making 2020 the biggest fire season in state
history. The [five largest fires on record in
California](https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/LNU-SCU-wildfires-skyrocket-into-top-3-largest-15508881.phphttps:/www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/LNU-SCU-wildfires-skyrocket-into-top-3-largest-15508881.php) have
occurred in the last three years. The Camp Fire in 2018 --- California's
most destructive, and deadliest, wildfire in history --- [destroyed an
average of one football field worth of land every three seconds and
killed 68
people](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/09/us/california-wildfires-superlatives-wcx/),
according to Cal Fire.

[And it's [not just California. Oregon, Washington, and Colorad]{.mark}o
have also [seen explosive fires]{.mark} that [have forced thousands to
evacuate, claimed lives, and destroyed homes and
businesses]{.mark}.]{.underline} Experts are warning that widespread
drought across the West will fuel another dangerous fire season in 2021.

[2**[. Extreme heat gets hotter]{.underline}**]{.mark}

[Heat waves [pose **health risks**]{.mark} and strain our energy
system]{.underline}

As global temperatures rise, the hottest temperatures --- and the number
of areas impacted by extreme heat --- are also rising. That means more
scorching hot days in more places.

Take the Texas cities of Austin and Houston, for example[. [Over the
past 50 years, Austin has seen the number of days with temperatures
above 100°F increase by one month]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline}
while Houston has recorded an additional month with temperatures above
95°F. In California, temperatures are estimated to have
increased [3°F](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/11/climate-change-california-wildfire/) in
the past century.

**[Through 2100, [scientists predict [hotter temperatures and more
frequent and intense heat
waves](https://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/global-warming/global-warming-impacts/heat-waves-and-climate-change-what-science-tells-us) in
every region of the U.S., according to the Union of Concerned
Scientists.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Extreme heat increases demand for air conditioning, fueling carbon
pollution and putting a strain our energy system that can lead to
blackouts. It also poses a serious health threat, especially for the
most vulnerable.

**[[3. Drought conditions persist]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Moisture evaporates from waterbodies and soil

Higher temperatures also lead to drier conditions. When global
temperatures rise, moisture evaporates from waterbodies and soil.

Droughts in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world have become more severe
and long-lasting thanks to climate change.

In fact, the American West is currently in the midst of a [mega
drought](https://www.kqed.org/science/1962273/megadrought-conditions-not-seen-for-400-years-have-returned-to-the-west-scientists-say) that
ranks among the worst in the past 1,200 years. Much of the region is
currently facing [\"extreme\" or \"exceptional\" drought
conditions](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/).

** **

**[[4. Warmer temperatures drive increases in
precipitation]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Areas that have historically trended toward heavy precipitation will get
wetter

Warmer air increases evaporation, which means that our atmosphere
contains an increasing amount of water vapor for storms to sweep up and
turn into rain or snow.

Just as drier areas are likely to get drier with rising global
temperatures, those areas of the world that have historically trended
toward heavy precipitation will only get wetter.

In the contiguous United States, rainfall in 2018 broke records, with an
average of 36.2 inches falling over a 12-month period --- more than 6
inches above average.

** **

**[[5. Hurricanes are becoming more intense]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Storm systems draw their energy from warm ocean water

Hurricanes are growing more powerful as global temperatures rise because
these storm systems draw their energy from warm ocean water.

[One of the most powerful
storms](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/us/hurricane-laura-update.html) to
ever hit the United States struck the Gulf Coast in August 2020.
[Hurricane Laura rapidly gained strength over the nearly 90°F waters of
the Gulf of Mexico. The Category 4 storm caused catastrophic damage to
structures and [suspected chemical
fires](https://twitter.com/TheInsiderPaper/status/1298996551256219648?s=20) among
the region\'s petrochemical plants.]{.underline}

In the future, we can expect to see more hurricanes along the lines of
Hurricane Laura and 2017's Hurricane Maria, which devastated the islands
of Dominica, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Officials
estimated that 3,000 people died in the aftermath of the catastrophic
storm that dropped nearly a quarter of the Puerto Rico's annual rainfall
in one day and unleashed maximum sustained winds of 175 mph.

Hurricane Katrina ripped into the Gulf Coast in August 2005, devastating
entire cities and [hitting Black communities like those in low-lying New
Orleans
parishes](https://ldh.la.gov/assets/docs/katrina/deceasedreports/KatrinaDeaths_082008.pdf) especially
hard. The storm claimed more than 1,800 lives, displaced hundreds of
thousands of residents, and left behind \$161 billion in property
damage.

Fifteen years after this costly disaster, our nation remains just as
susceptible, if not more so, to the threat of increasingly violent
hurricanes[. **[The 2020 hurricane season shattered records,
and [experts
warn](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/20/998584767/here-are-noaas-predictions-for-the-2021-atlantic-hurricane-season) that
we're in for another "above average" hurricane season in
2021]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}**

** **

**[[6. Sea level rise causes flooding]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Oceans are warming; land ice is melting

As the planet warms, ocean waters are also warming --- and expanding. At
the same time, warmer temperatures are causing land ice --- think
glaciers and ice caps --- to melt, which is adding water to the world's
oceans.

[[As a result, average global sea level has increased eight inches in
the last 150 years.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Right now, the Atlantic coast of the United States and the Gulf of
Mexico are experiencing some of the highest sea level rise in the world,
which, combined with record rainfall, has led to catastrophic flooding.

** **

**[[7. Winter storms hit harder]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Trapped water vapor leads to heavier snowfall

Even as climate change raises average global temperatures, that doesn't
spell the end of winters. Overall, winters are getting milder and
shorter; but recent winters have brought intense snowstorms and
record-breaking frost.

While it may seem contradictory, climate change may be contributing to
more extreme winter weather. As the warming atmosphere traps water vapor
later and later into the year, that precipitation leads to heavier
snowfall when the temperatures do drop.

Another factor is the rapidly warming Arctic, which some scientists
believe is weakening the jet stream and causing disruptions of [the
polar
vortex](https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-snowstorms-warming-winter-temperatures-climate-crisis).
The polar vortex refers to bands of wind and low air pressure near the
North Pole, which normally lock cold air over Arctic. When those bands
break down, icy air can escape south in the form of freezing winters.

In 2021, record-breaking snowstorms knocked out power for nearly 4.5
million homes in Texas as icy conditions and heating
demands [overwhelmed much of the region's power
supply](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-15/how-extreme-cold-turned-into-a-u-s-energy-crisis-quicktake).
More than a hundred people died, and the storms caused an estimated
\$295 billion in damage.

### 2NC\-\--Climate\-\--Structural !

#### Climate disproportionately harms and kills people of color

Jeremy **Williams 21**, writer for Foreign Policy, 7/21/2021, "The
Racial Violence of Climate Change",
https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/07/21/the-racial-violence-of-climate-change/

In September 2016, activists in Britain managed to breach the security
of London City Airport and get onto the runway. There, they erected a
tripod and locked themselves onto and around it. Flights were disrupted
for around six hours, and 131 planes were rerouted before police could
dismantle the protest. Nine arrests were made.

The action was carried out by Black Lives Matter U.K. (BLM U.K.), and
the banners they laid out on the ground read, "the climate crisis is a
racist crisis." The action was carried out to "highlight the U.K.'s
environmental impact on the lives of Black people locally and globally,"
BLM U.K. said in a statement. ["[Black people are the first to
die]{.mark}, not the first to fly, [in this racist climate
crisis.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

[Beyond making the connection between climate change and the global
inequality of its effects, the protesters' choice of London City Airport
is also significant]{.underline} because it is in the London borough of
Newham. London is already the most ethnically diverse city in Britain,
and [[Newham]{.mark} has the smallest percentage of white residents of
any local authority in the country,]{.underline} at 29 percent. [[It is
an archetypal "sacrifice zone"---a poorer district with a
disproportionate number of Black and Asian residents who put up with
more than their fair share of]{.mark} noise and [pollution.]{.mark}
London City Airport, meanwhile, serves the elite business travelers of
London's financial center. It's [a totemic example of
inequality,]{.mark}]{.underline} and its plans to expand further into
Newham would later make the airport a target of the climate activist
group Extinction Rebellion.

It was perhaps the first time climate and race were connected in the
British press, although it was widely misunderstood. "Have you been
hijacked?" the BBC asked a BLM U.K. spokesperson. The Daily Mail
complained that "all of those involved were white and all from
privileged backgrounds," even though this was a deliberate decision.
Even some antiracism campaigners were divided on the protest, wondering
if it was a distraction from the real issues. What did flying have to do
with Black Lives Matter?

Alexandra Wanjiku Kelbert, one of the protest organizers, explained BLM
U.K.'s actions: ["When we say [B]{.mark}lack [L]{.mark}ives
[M]{.mark}atter, we mean all Black lives, and that [includes]{.mark} the
lives of [those who live in proximity to airports]{.mark}, to [power
plants]{.mark}, to the busiest of roads, and [whose children grow up
with asthma and skin conditions exacerbated by]{.mark} air
[pollution]{.mark}."]{.underline} One particular child comes to mind:
[Ella Kissi-Debrah. After suffering from respiratory problems for
several years,]{.underline} she [died in 2013 after a particularly
severe asthma attack. She was 9 years old.]{.underline}

Her mother, Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, knew [air pollution in]{.underline}
their area of London [was a factor in her]{.underline} condition and
therefore in her [death]{.underline}. But as is usually the case, the
official cause of death was recorded as asthma. It was only after a long
legal case that an inquest ruled in 2020: ["Ella died of asthma
contributed to by exposure to excessive air pollution."]{.underline} It
was the first time a coroner in the United Kingdom had named air
pollution as a cause of death. London's Black residents face greater
exposure to air pollution, and some of the city's most polluted
districts have large Black populations. [There is a racial dimension to
air pollution in London, another example of environmental injustice and
an echo of the Black Lives Matter rallying cry "I can't
breathe."]{.underline}

Black Lives Matter has mainly been associated with police brutality and
mass incarceration along with violence against Black people generally.
But in counting the cost of climate change or air pollution, it's
important to recognize that [[environmental harm is]{.mark} also [a form
of violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Climate Change killing people by the minute

**Hersher 22** (Rebecca Hersher (she/her) is a reporter on NPR\'s
Science Desk, where she reports on outbreaks, natural disasters, and
environmental and health research, "Climate change is killing people,
but there's still time to reverse the damage", NPR,
/02/28/1082564304/billions-of-people-are-in-danger-from-climate-change-u-n-report-warns)

There have been big advances in climate science since the last report of
this kind was published nearly a decade ago. Scientists are now able to
see the fingerprints of climate change on individual storms, wildfires
and heat waves. Those connections allow epidemiologists, economists and
social scientists to study the effects of global warming on human health
and well-being.

[The results are sobering. \"**Climate change has already affected the
physical and mental health of many Americans,\"** says Sherilee Harper,
one of the report authors and a researcher at the University of Alberta
in Canada.]{.underline}

[For example, climate change is **dangerous for pregnant women**, the
report notes for the first time. Wildfire smoke **exacerbates
respiratory and cardiovascular disease**. And the trauma of living
through a weather disaster can cause **long-term mental health
problems.**]{.underline}

The authors return again and again to the deadly effects of heat waves.
Around the world, high temperatures are killing people and making them
sick.

That is also true in the U.S. \"Heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer
in the United States,\" says Juan Declet-Barreto of the Union of
Concerned Scientists. \"The effects of extreme heat aren\'t always
visible, which is something that makes people forget about them. But
they are dangerous precisely because of that relative invisibility.\"

[**Worldwide, poor people, Indigenous people and others who are
marginalized are at the highest risk from heat and from the effects of
climate change more broadly,** the report notes repeatedly.]{.underline}

\"I think we have not done a good enough job focusing on the poor and
vulnerable,\" says Ko Barrett, one of the co-chairs of the U.N.
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a top climate official at
the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

**[In the U.S., poor people and people of color are more likely to live
and work in dense urban areas with limited green space where

Heat waves are particularly dangerous when they hit areas that are
historically temperate, such as the Pacific Northwest, where [hundreds
of people
died](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/02/1012467409/hundreds-are-believed-to-have-died-during-the-pacific-northwest-heat-wave) in

reduce the risks. People and ecosystems least able to cope are being
hardest hit, said scientists in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) report, released today.]{.underline}

"This report is a dire warning about the consequences of inaction," said
Hoesung Lee, Chair of the IPCC. "It shows that climate change is a grave
and mounting threat to our wellbeing and a healthy planet. **[[Our
actions today will shape how people adapt and nature responds to
increasing climate risks."]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The world faces unavoidable multiple climate hazards over the next two
decades with global warming of 1.5°C (2.7°F). Even temporarily exceeding
this warming level will result in additional severe impacts, some of
which will be irreversible. [[Risks for society will increase,
**including to infrastructure** and low-lying coastal
settlements.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The Summary for Policymakers of the IPCC Working Group II
report, *Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability* was
approved on Sunday, February *27 2022, *by 195 member governments of the
IPCC, through a virtual approval session that was held over two weeks
starting on February 14.

**Urgent action required to deal with increasing risks**

[Increased [heatwaves]{.mark}, [droughts]{.mark} and [floods]{.mark} are
already [exceeding]{.mark} plants' and animals' [tolerance thresholds,
driving mass mortalities]{.mark} in species such as trees and corals.

impacts that are increasingly difficult to manage. **[They have exposed

climate change]{.mark}, at the same time as making rapid, deep cuts in
greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}. So far, progress on adaptation is
uneven and there are increasing gaps between action taken and what is
needed to deal with the increasing risks, the new report finds. These
gaps are largest among lower-income populations. 

The Working Group II report is the second instalment of the IPCC's Sixth
Assessment Report (AR6), which will be completed this year.

"This report recognizes the interdependence of climate, biodiversity and
people and integrates [natural]{.underline}, social and economic

U.S.",
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/climate/climate-change-deal-manchin.html> -
Haoyou

WASHINGTON --- [The \$369 billion climate and tax package forged in a
surprise deal by Senate Democrats on Wednesday would be the most
ambitious action ever taken by the United States to try to stop the
planet from catastrophically overheating.]{.underline}

The agreement, which Senate Democrats hope to pass as early as next
week, shocked even some who had been involved in the sputtering
negotiations over climate legislation during the past year.
[[The]{.mark} announcement of a [deal]{.mark}, after many activists had
given up hope, almost instantly [reset the role of the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [in]{.mark} the global effort to
fight [climate]{.mark} change.]{.underline}

And [it was delivered by Senator Joe Manchin]{.underline} III of West
Virginia, the holdout Democrat who had been reviled by environmentalists
and some of his own colleagues after he said this month that he could
not support a climate bill because of inflation concerns.

["By a wide margin, [this]{.mark} legislation [will be the greatest
pro-climate legislation that has ever been passed]{.mark} by Congress,"
Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader, said]{.underline}
in announcing the deal with Mr. Manchin.

[[The bill]{.mark}]{.underline} aims to [[tackle]{.mark} global [warming
by using]{.mark} billions of dollars in [tax incentives to ramp
up]{.mark} wind, solar, geothermal, battery and other [clean
energy]{.mark} industries over the next decade. [Companies]{.mark} would
[receive]{.mark} financial [incentives to]{.mark} keep open nuclear
plants that might have closed, or to [capture emissions]{.mark} from
industrial facilities and bury them underground before they can warm the
planet. Car [buyers with incomes below a certain level would receive
a]{.mark} \$7,500 [tax credit to purchase a n]{.mark}ew [electric
vehicle]{.mark} and \$4,000 for a used one. Americans would receive
rebates to install heat pumps and make their homes more
energy-efficient.]{.underline}

["This is the action the American people have been waiting
for,"]{.underline} President Biden said, hailing the bill's
["investments in our energy security for the future."]{.underline}

Senate [Democrats estimated that [the legislation
would]{.mark}]{.underline} enable the United States to
[[cut]{.underline}]{.mark} greenhouse gas [[emissions to 40 percent
below 2005 levels]{.mark} by 2030, [putting the nation within striking
distance of the]{.mark} aggressive climate [goal]{.mark}s laid out
by]{.underline} Mr. [Biden last year]{.underline}.

Mr. [[Biden wants to slash]{.mark} U.S. [emissions to at least 50
percent below 2005 levels]{.mark} by the end of this decade,
which]{.underline} [is]{.underline} roughly [[the pace]{.mark}
scientists say [the]{.mark} whole [world must follow to limit]{.mark}
global [warming to]{.mark}]{.underline} 1.5 degrees Celsius
([[2]{.mark}.7 degrees Fahrenheit]{.underline}) [above preindustrial
levels]{.underline}. [[That's the threshold beyond which]{.mark}
scientists say the [likelihood of catastrophic floods, fires, storms and
drought increases]{.mark} significantly. The planet has already warmed
by about 1.1 degrees over the past century]{.underline}.

[The bill "keeps us in the climate fight and makes it possible that
executive action, state and local government policies, and private
sector leadership can get us across the finish line,"]{.underline} said
Jesse Jenkins of Princeton University, who modeled the effects of
earlier versions of the legislation. ["[Without this bill]{.mark}, [we'd
be hopelessly far from our]{.mark} climate [goals]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Diplomats and [climate experts said they hoped [the deal would
revitalize international efforts]{.mark} to tackle global warming,
[which have flagged]{.mark} in recent months [as]{.mark} the war in
Ukraine and surging [oil prices have led]{.mark} many [countries]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} focus on [shor]{.mark}ing [up fossil fuel]{.mark}
[s]{.mark}upplies.]{.underline} The world's governments are far from
doing what they must to meet the target of 1.5 degrees, and leaders are
scheduled to meet in Egypt in November to discuss stepping up their
efforts.

"We all needed good news," said Tina Stege, the climate envoy for the
Marshall Islands, which is at risk of disappearing beneath rising seas.
The announcement of a climate deal "puts much-needed wind in our sails,"
she said, though she cautioned that "we remain far from where we need to
be."

Jonathan [Pershing]{.underline}, who served as Mr. Biden's deputy
climate change envoy until January, [said]{.underline} that [in recent
weeks he]{.underline} had [fielded concerns from former counterparts
from Africa and China who were acutely aware of the]{.underline} seeming
[collapse of U.S. climate legislation]{.underline}.

["They were like, ']{.underline}OK, [you guys aren't going to do this,
so why should we do it,'"]{.underline} Mr. Pershing recalled. ["I think
you now have a fundamentally different narrative."]{.underline}

Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said [[the
legislation would restore American credibility in international
negotiations]{.mark}. "You can't preach temperance from a bar stool, and
[you can't ask China, India, Brazil or other]{.mark} countrie[s to cut
emissions if we're not doing it ourselves]{.mark} in a significant
way,"]{.underline} he said.

-Haoyou

Senate [[Rep]{.mark}ublican[s are unanimously
opposed]{.mark}]{.underline} to the legislation.

"It is nothing short of an attack on the American family," Senator John
Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, said in a statement. "If we want to
reduce inflation, lower energy costs, and cut the deficit, the recipe is
clear. Congress should cut spending and unleash American oil and natural
gas production."

[[The bill would affect]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly [[every aspect
of]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [[energy production]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[It includes \$30 billion in incentives for companies to build solar
panels, wind turbines and batteries and to process critical minerals in
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[, aiming to reverse the
longstanding migration of clean energy manufacturing to
China]{.underline} and elsewhere.

[[Companies]{.mark} have said they [are ready to respond
quickly]{.mark}. QCells, a]{.underline} South Korean-based [solar
company that is already building a \$171 million assembly
factory]{.underline} in Dalton, Ga., [is planning a multibillion-dollar
expansion of supply chains in the United States if the bill]{.underline}
[passes]{.underline}, said Scott Moskowitz, QCells' head of market
strategy and public affairs.

[[Also included is \$60 billion to address the disproportionate burden
of pollution on low-income communities]{.mark} and communities of
color;]{.underline} [[\$27]{.mark} [billion for a "green bank"]{.mark}
aimed at delivering financial support to clean energy projects; [and
\$20 billion]{.mark} for programs [to cut emissions in]{.mark} the
[ag]{.mark}riculture sector.]{.underline}

The most immediate effect of the bill, energy experts said, will be to
supercharge the growth of wind turbine, solar panel and electric vehicle
production in the United States. Renewable energy production has slowed
significantly this year, due to pandemic-related disruptions, trade
disputes and uncertainty about federal policy, according to a recent
report by the American Clean Power Association, which represents wind
and solar energy companies and battery manufacturers.

["The entire clean energy industry just breathed an enormous sigh of
relief,"]{.underline} said Heather Zichal, chief executive of the
association. "This is an 11th-hour reprieve for climate action and clean
energy jobs."

[[For decades, the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} has [[provided tax
credits]{.mark} for wind and solar]{.underline} power [[that expire
after one to two years]{.mark}, subjecting the industry to a boom-bust
cycle until the credits are renewed. [Under the new legislation,
the]{.mark} tax [credits would last up to 10 years, to give companies
the confidence to make long-term investment
decisions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"This is the action the American people have been waiting for. This

His previous opposition had essentially killed Biden\'s ambitious plans,
because in the 50-50 Senate, where Republicans rarely back Biden on

and climate initiatives** and \$64 billion into **state-funded
healthcare**]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} a popular [measure]{.mark}
meant [to]{.mark} **[lower ]{.mark}**]{.underline}ruinously high
**[[prescription medicine prices]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

It would be paid for by raising \$739 billion, with a major chunk coming
from a 15 percent corporate tax rate. [An [extra \$300
billion]{.underline}]{.mark} [raised under the plan [would]{.mark} go to
[pay]{.mark}ing [off the **federal deficit**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Biden, who has had to abandon even broader scale social and
environmental spending ideas, got the good news of a reprieve for this
bill on the same day he finished his five days isolating after a
Covid-19 infection.

It also comes as Congress moves closer to passing another of his
priorities \-- a \$52 billion fund to encourage domestic production of
semiconductors, the electronic brains in modern equipment ranging from
washing machines to military weapons.

[In his statement, Biden said [prescription drug prices would
drop]{.mark} and healthcare for Americans using the subsidized
**Affordable Care Act policy** [would]{.mark} also [become]{.mark} \$800
a year [cheaper.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Funding]{.mark} [for **clean energy**]{.mark} will \"[create thousands

\"We will [pay]{.underline} for all of this by requiring big
corporations to pay their fair share of taxes, [[with **no tax
increases**]{.mark} at all [for families making under \$400,000 a

Biden thanked Manchin, an often unpredictable partner in the Senate, for
his \"extraordinary effort.\" \"

[If enacted, [this legislation will be
**historic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and I urge the Senate to move on this
bill as soon as possible, and for the House to follow as well.\"

#### Inflation Reduction Act Pivotal to Fixing Core Crises 

Taiyler Simone **Mitchell &** Joseph **Zeballos-Roig 22**, Politics
Reporter for Business Insider, 7/28/22, "Read the full text of the deal
that Manchin and Schumer just struck to curb inflation, tax
corporations, and fight climate change,"
<https://www.businessinsider.com/read-heres-whats-in-the-manchin-deal-for-bidens-agenda-2022-7> -
Inti

[Sen. Joe Manchin reached a deal with Senate Majority Lead Chuck Schumer
on The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022]{.underline}.

A summary of the deal says it \"will make a historic down payment\" to
help the economy and fight climate change. Full text of the bill was
dropped on Wednesday night.

Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, helped thwart President Joe Biden\'s
efforts to establish an expansive Build Back Better plan aimed at
climate, economic, and health care progress. The deal that Manchin and
Schumer struck is a skinnier version of Biden\'s original plan.

\"For too long, the reconciliation debate in Washington has been defined
by how it can help advance Democrats\' political agenda called Build
Back Better. Build Back Better is dead, and instead, we have the
opportunity to make our country stronger by bringing Americans
together,\" the West Virginia Democrat said in a statement.

[Senior Democrats intend to pay for a deal through a 15% corporate
minimum tax, IRS tax enforcement, and closing a loophole that benefits
wealthy investors.]{.underline}

\"I will do everything I can to usher in a new era of compromise and
commonsense that will make America more energy secure, financially
sound, and a more united country for this generation and the next,\" he
added.

**Energy and climate**

The new deal goes against Manchin\'s previous comments suggesting he
would not support spending on climate change.

The [bill will]{.mark} [allocate \$369 billion to energy security and
climate change working to **[lower carbon emissions by 40% by the year
2030]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Part of that is achieved with new tax
credits for electric vehicles meant to encourage more Americans to buy
them.

Under the bill, Americans qualify for a \$4,500 tax credit to buy used
electric vehicles, depending on their annual income. The amount
increases to \$7,500 if it\'s a new EV.

It [[sets aside \$60 billion for]{.mark} the manufacturing of
**[domestic clean energy]{.mark}**. There are also tax credits to slash
the cost of heat pumps, water heaters, and rooftop solar
energy.]{.underline}

The bill aims to [bring down energy costs]{.mark} as well.

**Affordable Care Act extension**

A[n estimated \$[64 billion]{.mark} will be [focused on]{.mark} the
extension of the **[Affordable Care Act]{.mark}**]{.underline}, also
known as Obamacare, for an additional three years through 2025, one year
longer than Democrats had suggested. Americans purchasing insurance
under the program would pay no more than 8.5% of their income for
coverage.

[Many middle-income families would qualify for financial assistance for
the first time, and lower-income households would pay little or nothing
for insurance.]{.underline} The extension [doesn\'t impose additional
restrictions on who is eligible]{.underline}, otherwise known as a
means-test.

The program was first established under the Biden stimulus law last year
and it\'s set to expire at the end of 2022. Democrats are racing to
prevent the program from ending since voters would receive notices of
their spiking premiums only weeks before the November midterms.

**Prescription drug reform**

[The [deal also allows Medicare to **negotiate**]{.mark} **the [price of
10 prescription drugs]{.mark}** starting in 2026, a top Democratic
goal.]{.underline} That amount increases over the years.

It also caps out-of-pocket costs for seniors relying on Medicare Part D
at \$2,000 annually. The bill [also penalizes drugmakers if they
increase prices faster than inflation rates.]{.underline} Then, Medicare
beneficiaries would qualify for free vaccines.

However, it omits another major priority for Democrats: Capping the cost
of insulin to \$35 per month. That forms part of a bill by Democratic
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and GOP Sen. Susan Collins of
Maine.

#### The bill still solves -- compromise just keeps Manchin on board and reduces inflation

-Haoyou

But [[even with]{.mark} the [concessions to]{.mark} the
[fossil-fuel]{.mark} industry, ["the bill is still absolutely worth it
for climate change,"]{.mark} said Leah Stokes, a professor of
environmental policy]{.underline} at the University of Santa Barbara,
California, [who had been advising Senate Democrats]{.underline}.

Two weeks ago, when even Mr. Biden seemed to be writing an obituary for
climate legislation, a small group of lawmakers continued to work with
Mr. Manchin. Several Democrats and climate activists credited Senator
John Hickenlooper of Colorado with keeping the lines of communication to
Mr. Manchin open.

"When a lot of people said 'That's the end' and everyone's writing it
off, I went to everybody I knew and said, 'Wait a minute, we can't
quit," said Mr. Hickenlooper, a onetime geologist for an oil and gas
company. "We don't have a satisfactory alternative."

[[Many were wary about]{.mark} continuing
[negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline} because "they didn't want to have
their heart broken again," Mr. Hickenlooper said.
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}, he said, Mr. [[Manchin]{.mark} insisted that
he [was]{.mark} still [open to a deal]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Mr. Hickenlooper said the group worked closely with experts at the
Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and that Mr. [Manchin
put much stock in their data indicating that [legislation could be
designed that did not worsen inflation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

He called Mr. Manchin "an honest broker" in the talks, one who wanted to
find a way to address climate change without creating a burden for the
fossil fuel workers in his state.

"He never told me he was done, and I said as long as Joe Manchin is at
the table, I'm at the table," Mr. Hickenlooper said.

#### Package key to climate and energy- billions reserved for both areas.

[The [package]{.mark} would [set]{.mark} aside [\$**369 billion for
climate and energy proposals**]{.mark}, the [most ambitious climate
action]{.mark} ever taken by Congress, and **raise an estimated \$451
billion in new tax revenue over a decad**e, **while [cutting federal

a summary circulated Wednesday
evening](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary.pdf)]{.underline}.

The product of a deal announced by Mr. Manchin and Senator Chuck
Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, it would reduce
the federal deficit by about \$300 billion, while seeking to push down
the cost of health care, prescription medicines and electricity.

The plan falls far short of the ambitious domestic policy and tax
package President Biden proposed last year, but Democrats, looking
toward midterm elections that are likely to be shaped by voters'
concerns about soaring costs, pitched it as a targeted attack on the
rapid price increases that have socked American consumers in the wallet
this year, with inflation running at a 40-year high.

The announcement suggested that Democrats could move in the coming days
to salvage a major piece of their domestic agenda, which only weeks ago
appeared doomed given Mr. Manchin's refusal to quickly sign on. Top
Democrats [released
legislation](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_of_2022.pdf) on
Wednesday evening, aiming for votes as early as next week.

"This is the action the American people have been waiting for," Mr.
Biden said in a statement, calling on both chambers to quickly pass the
measure. "[[This addresses the problems of today --- **high health care
costs and overall inflation --- as well as investments in our energy

On Wednesday, July 27, 2022, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY)
and Sen. Joe [Manchin]{.underline} (D-WV) [issued a joint
statement](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-majority-leader-chuck-schumer-d-ny-and-sen-joe-manchin-d-wv-on-wednesday-announced-that-they-have-struck-a-long-awaited-deal-on-legislation-that-aims-to-reform-the-tax-code-fight-climate-change-and-cut-health-care-costs) announcing
their agreement to move forward with legislation---called the
[I]{.mark}nflation [R]{.mark}eduction [A]{.mark}ct---that [[would
address climate change, tax reform, prescription drug reform, and health
care costs]{.mark} through the fiscal year 2022 budget reconciliation
process. This would be a [historic accomplishment]{.mark} in
[tackling]{.mark} the long-standing [crises of climate change and health
care costs]{.mark}, and the legislation would also address
inflation---an urgent challenge.]{.underline}

Inflation occurs when there is a mismatch between supply and demand:
Prices rise because there is too little supply to keep up with demand.
Inflation is happening around the world in 2022, amid two years of
supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's war
in Ukraine. To combat this phenomenon, [the Inflation Reduction Act
[would close loopholes exploited by corporations and the wealthy and
crack down on tax cheats]{.mark}]{.underline}. These actions decrease
demand, because fairer taxes help reduce excess demand. Meanwhile, the
legislation increases supply through smart investments in domestic
manufacturing and clean energy. **[[The Inflation Reduction Act would
also lower the cost of energy, prescription drugs, and health care
premiums---some of the biggest expenses squeezing
families.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

This fact sheet details just a few of the ways the Inflation Reduction
Act would lower inflation.

**The Inflation Reduction Act lessens demand**

UCLA economist Kim Clausing [has
noted](https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/no-joe-manchin-taxes-dont-cause-inflation-kimberly-clausing) that
ensuring the wealthiest corporations and individuals pay their fair
share in taxes is anti-inflationary. Indeed, fairer taxes help reduce
inflation by decreasing excess demand, including through less disposable
income and consumption. The core tax measures in the Inflation Reduction
Act include:

- [[\$313
  billion](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary.pdf) in
  revenue raised from a 15 percent corporate minimum tax]{.underline}

- [[\$124
  billion](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary.pdf) in
  revenue raised from better IRS tax enforcement]{.underline}

- [[\$14
  billion ](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary.pdf)in
  revenue raised from closing the carried interest loophole]{.underline}

**The Inflation Reduction Act increases supply**

The Inflation Reduction Act relieves the threat of supply chain
bottlenecks by investing in domestic manufacturing and deployment of
reliable clean energy that will bring down long-term costs. Expanding
domestic clean energy capacity means that energy prices will be less
vulnerable to global supply shocks in the future.

**The Inflation Reduction Act pushes down the cost of key consumer
expenses**

Most people experience inflation through the prices they pay for their
regular expenses. Keeping prices down for categories of major purchases,
such as health care and energy costs, has a significant impact on
household budgets. While lower prices can increase demand, the net
effect is likely still lower inflation.

The Inflation Reduction Act pushes down costs in the following ways:

- The legislation empowers Medicare to negotiate prescription drug
  prices directly, ensuring that seniors get better deals on their
  medications, and caps Medicare beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs for
  drugs at \$2,000 per year. Millions of people would also have lower
  net health insurance costs because the Inflation Reduction Act extends
  enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits for the next three
  years.

- The legislation provides money for home energy rebates, consumer tax
  credits for energy-efficient homes and vehicles, and grants to make
  affordable housing more energy efficient. These measures would help
  reduce energy costs for families by [more than 10
  percent](https://rhg.com/research/us-climate-policy-2030/) on average.

**[[Anyone who truly cares about the cost-of-living pressures facing
Americans today must work to pass the Inflation Reduction Act as soon as
possible.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**The Inflation Reduction Act decreases the deficit**

[Taken together, the Inflation Reduction Act's measures would reduce the
budget deficit by more than \$300 billion over the next 10
years, [reducing inflationary
pressures](https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1552442174775902208?s=20&t=0fbwnkmYTLQAi2aqTdSBrQ) in
the process.]{.underline} Yet this estimate is highly
conservative; [many
experts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/17/cbo-build-back-better-irs-revenue-too-low/) agree
that the IRS funding would produce much more revenue than estimated,
especially by deterring tax cheats. And the deficit is [already
projected](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58147#_idTextAnchor007) to
come down by \$1.7 trillion this year.

**The Inflation Reduction Act puts less pressure on the Federal Reserve
to raise interest rates**

[As the [Inflation Reduction Act r]{.mark}educes inflation, the Biden
administration is helping to decrease pressure on the Federal Reserve to
aggressively increase interest rates, which [should **help
avoid**]{.mark} a potential **[recession]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Rapidly
increasing interest rates [risk higher
unemployment](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-federal-reserve-must-be-careful-not-to-jeopardize-the-strong-economic-recovery/) and
reduce people's ability to buy a home. Fortunately, the Inflation
Reduction Act offers additional tools, such as no new taxes on
small-business owners or families making less than \$400,000 a year.
Only wealthy corporations currently paying less than a 15 percent
corporate tax, Wall Street fund managers exploiting the carried interest
tax loophole, and cheaters who aren't paying the taxes they already owe
would now have to pay their fair share.

**Conclusion**

From day one, President Joe Biden has made lowering prices for everyday
Americans a central focus of his presidency. [**[The Inflation Reduction
Act would supplement measures to strengthen the labor market and lower
the cost of gas and groceries, creating a stronger economy for all.
Anyone who truly cares about the cost-of-living pressures facing
Americans today must work to pass the Inflation Reduction Act as soon as
possible]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

#### Bill would mean a Breakthrough for Lower Energy Costs and Climate Progress

Guest **Author 22**, 8/1/22, \"The Inflation Reduction Act: A
breakthrough for lower energy costs and climate progress,\" Climate 411,
https://blogs.edf.org/climate411/2022/08/01/the-inflation-reduction-act-a-breakthrough-for-lower-energy-costs-and-climate-progress/

If passed by both the Senate and the House, [[this bill will]{.mark} be
the largest investment in combating climate change ever passed by
Congress --- [driv]{.mark}ing [down carbon pollution 40% below 2005
levels by 2030.]{.mark}]{.underline} [This will]{.mark} bring the U.S.
substantially closer to President Biden's goal of cutting climate
pollution in half by 2030 and [r[eturn the U.S. to a **leadership role**
in the global fight against climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}

These fiscally responsible investments will create good-paying clean
energy and manufacturing jobs and boost U.S. energy security --- all
while saving families and businesses money. The bill also makes a
historic down payment on environmental justice.

While the bill does contain some trade-offs, taken together, the
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will greatly benefit our economy and our
climate fight -- now and for generations to come. Here are the key
investments you should know and why they matter.

**[Clean energy]{.underline}**

[[The bill]{.mark} includes more than \$135 billion in clean energy tax
credits --- a game-changing package of incentives that [will ramp up
solar, wind and energy storage on the grid]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Building a clean power sector is essential for driving down climate
pollution, while helping consumers reduce their energy use and hedging
against volatile natural gas prices. Previous estimates on energy
investments, including clean energy tax credits, have shown they could
[save households roughly \$500 a year in energy costs]{.underline} when
fully implemented.

Furthermore, the 10-year [extension]{.mark} [on]{.mark} these [[tax
credits gives renewable energy providers across the U.S.]{.mark} the
[certainty]{.mark} they need [to build and **expand clean energy
projects**]{.mark} in the long term]{.underline}. As utilities and
renewable energy companies said in a letter to Congress earlier in July,
"Our companies are proactively shifting to clean energy and investing in
energy efficiency... But corporate action alone is insufficient to meet
the scope and scale of the climate crisis and deliver benefits to all."

In addition to clean electricity tax credits, there are significant
investments in emerging and expanding climate solutions, such as green
hydrogen, low-emissions sustainable aviation fuels, direct air capture
and carbon storage --- though it will be critical to monitor these
investments as they move forward and put protections in place to
maximize climate benefits and protect local communities and ecosystems.

**[Other notable clean energy investments include:]{.underline}**

\$27 billion for a "**[green bank]{.underline}**" that will [leverage
more private dollars to finance deployment of clean
technology]{.underline}, like solar farms and electric vehicles.

\$9 billion for consumer home rebate programs that will [reduce energy
costs]{.underline}, particularly for lower income households.

\$2 billion in funding to [expand transmission lines needed to
accelerate clean energy deployment.]{.underline}

\$18 billion in additional DOE loan authority to [support economic
opportunities to tribes through energy projects.]{.underline}

\$40 billion in [loan]{.mark} authority [to help [innovative energy
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}, like energy storage, battery and
building efficiency technologies reach commercial deployment.

\$250 billion for new refinancing and investment tools to reduce
consumer electricity costs through reinvestment at existing and retired
energy infrastructure sites.

Bonus tax incentives to develop clean energy resources in low-income
communities and areas experiencing a transition away from fossil fuels.

More than \$10 billion to support renewable buildout in rural areas
through loans and assistance for electric cooperatives.

**[Clean transportation]{.underline}**

The Inflation Reduction Act takes aim at the largest source of climate
pollution in the U.S.: transportation. Taken together with the
infrastructure package passed by Congress last year, [[this bill]{.mark}
has the potential to [jumpstart the adoption of electric light-duty
vehicles]{.mark} and provide a significant down payment on medium- and
heavy-duty trucks and bus electrification.]{.underline}

The proposed legislation features a consumer tax credit of up to \$4,000
for used clean light-duty vehicles and \$7,500 for new purchases --
though uptake levels may depend on our success in building out domestic
supply chains. In addition, [[there is]{.mark} substantial]{.underline}
[[funding for **zero-emission** trucks and buses]{.underline}]{.mark}
--- some of the biggest polluters on our roads. While they account for
just 5% of vehicles, they are [[responsible for more than a quarter of
all climate pollution]{.mark} from the transportation sector an[d nearly
half the deaths]{.mark} [from air pollution]{.mark} linked to
transportation.]{.underline}

Passing the Inflation Reduction Act will be an important step forward in
addressing this major -- and growing -- source of transportation
pollution, while injecting new life into the economy by supercharging
America's manufacturing capacity.

Other notable clean transportation investments include:

Up to \$40,000 tax credit for commercial ZEVs.

\$1 billion in grants for class 6 and 7 heavy-duty vehicles, like school
and transit buses and garbage trucks --- \$400 million of which is
focused in areas of high air pollution.

Heavy-duty charging infrastructure tax credit, which increases incentive
eligibility from \$30,000 per property to \$100,000 per item.

\$3 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to purchase zero-emission
vehicles and related infrastructure.

\$3 billion in grants to reduce air pollution at ports, to support the
purchase and installation of zero-emission equipment and technology at
ports.

\$60 million to reduce diesel emissions resulting from goods movement
facilities, and vehicles servicing goods movement facilities, in
low-income and disadvantaged communities to address the health impacts
of such emissions on such communities.

**[Domestic manufacturing and decarbonizing industry]{.underline}**

Through a range of investments and incentives, [the [bill will create
good-paying clean energy and manufacturing jobs throughout the
U.S]{.mark}. ---]{.underline} positioning our country to take hold of
the \$23 trillion global clean energy market expected by the end of the
decade. This includes \$60 billion in [[investments for clean energy
technology manufacturing that will help maximize American jobs building
electric vehicles, solar, wind]{.underline}]{.mark} and more, while
minimizing supply chain disruptions.

The industrial and manufacturing sector itself is also responsible for a
quarter of U.S. emissions --- and is expected to grow --- but industry
faces numerous challenges in deploying clean energy solutions. The bill
helps fill this gap with nearly \$6 billion in grants to help
energy-intensive industrial facilities reduce their emissions and
significant funding to spur the market for low-emissions construction
materials.

Other notable manufacturing and industrial investments include:

\$500 million for the use of the Defense Production Act to accelerate
domestic clean energy manufacturing for energy technologies like solar
and critical electric grid components.

\$2 billion for domestic manufacturing conversion grants to retool
existing auto manufacturing facilities to manufacture clean vehicles.

Up to \$20 billion in loans to build new clean vehicle manufacturing
facilities across the country -- including \$3 billion for the Advanced
Technology Vehicle Manufacturing program.

\$4 billion for the General Services Administration and Federal Highway
Administration to acquire and install low-carbon construction materials.

\$250 million to enable carbon-intensity reporting for construction
materials and products through the development of environmental product
declarations.

**[Environmental justice]{.underline}**

[The bill will invest \$60 billion in environmental justice, an
important [step toward addressing legacies of disinvestment and
pollution burden in mostly Black, Latino, **Indigenous and low-income
communitie**]{.mark}**s**]{.underline} --- and ensuring these
communities benefit from a clean energy future. This includes \$3
billion in block grants and additional funding to address air pollution
with better health data, [[using innovative technology to identify
**pollution hotspots and blind spots**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Continued
leadership from environmental justice communities on how and where these
investments will be deployed is imperative.

[Nearly 150 million Americans, or roughly half of the population, live
in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution]{.underline}. The health
harms fall most heavily on Black, Latino, Indigenous and low-income
communities because coal-fired power plants, oil refineries,
petrochemical plants, ports, highways and other sources of air pollution
are more likely to be located near them. Many of the clean
transportation investments mentioned above, like the grants for ports
and clean heavy-duty trucks and buses, will reduce health-harming air
pollution.

While the bill ushers unprecedented resources toward environmental
justice, much more will be needed. In addition to an ongoing need for
direct investment in overburdened areas, we must prioritize addressing
environmental justice concerns as emerging technologies are developed
and deployed; ensure strong community consultation processes are built
into any new siting and permitting discussions; and define health
thresholds that ensure no additional harms will be experienced by
communities.

Other notable environmental justice investments include:

\$3 billion for environmental justice block grants to reduce air
pollution, mitigate climate and health risks, increase climate
adaptation, and facilitate community engagement in public processes.

\$3 billion in grants to reconnect communities disconnected by
transportation developments through community-led projects that address
neighborhood equity, safety and affordable transportation.

\$1 billion grant program to make affordable housing more energy
efficient.

Nearly \$700 million for federal agencies and departments to conduct
environmental reviews and community engagement on energy and
infrastructure projects and other activities.

\$280 million for air quality monitoring, including in disadvantaged
communities burdened by high air pollution levels, including \$117
million for communities near industrial sources of pollution.

\$1.5 billion in competitive grants for tree planting and other
activities to reduce urban heat challenges in underserved areas.

**[Curbing methane pollution]{.underline}**

[The Inflation Reduction [Act will create a program to tackle methane
pollution]{.mark}]{.underline} --- a short-lived, but highly potent
greenhouse gas which is more than 80 times as potent than carbon dioxide
for the first 20 years after it is emitted. Administered by EPA, [the
Methane Emission Reduction Program (MERP) [will complement critical EPA
regulations to drive down harmful methane emissions from oil and gas
operations]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the largest industrial emitter of
methane pollution --- which waste energy resources, harm our health and
drive dangerous climate change.

More details on the Methane Emission Reduction Program:

MERP will assess a charge on wasteful methane emissions above threshold
levels that are based on the oil and gas industry's own targets,
starting in 2024 at \$900/ton of methane. (The fee would only be
assessed on the largest oil and gas polluters that already report their
emissions).

The program also allocates funding for EPA to provide support to
operators as well as disadvantaged communities impacted by pollution
from oil and gas operations and funding for EPA to monitor methane
emissions and improve methane emission estimates.

Climate-smart agriculture and climate resilience

The bill contains vital investments that will build climate resilience
and put rural communities at the forefront of climate solutions,
including nearly \$21 billion funding for climate-friendly agriculture.
This funding will help U.S. farmers and rural communities cut emissions
and prepare for climate impacts that cannot be avoided. Farmers and
rural communities are on the frontlines of climate change, with higher
temperatures and changing rainfall making it harder to grow food; and at
the same time, crop and livestock production account for more than 10%
of U.S. emissions. These programs also create jobs and help revitalize
rural economies.

In addition, the bill will fund coastal resilience solutions --
including \$2.6 billion to NOAA -- that can make coastal communities,
ecosystems and infrastructure better protected in the face of growing
climate threats

Other notable resilience investments include:

\$5 billion in funding for forests, including significant funding for
natural climate solutions like reforestation and building resilience to
catastrophic wildfires.

\$50 million to NOAA for climate research to better understand how
climate change is disrupting weather, ocean, coastal and atmospheric
processes, and how climate change is impacting marine species and
coastal habitats.

\$150 million to NOAA to accelerate advances in weather, ocean, coastal
and climate research, observation systems, modeling and forecasting.

It's important to note that this deal is not perfect. It does have
trade-offs, including reinstating offshore oil and gas lease sales that

with]{.underline}]{.mark} President Joe [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark},
including the time she reportedly fought with White House aides about
the need to mask up in the presence of the then-septuagenarian president
last spring. According to This Will Not Pass, a forthcoming book about
the Biden-Harris administration written by New York Times reporters
Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns, the Democratic senator from Arizona
repeatedly asked why, if [[she'd]{.underline}]{.mark} already been

#### 3\] Biden has FAILED to keep democrats in line and to get agendas through \-\-- No PC for him

Adam **Tooze 22**, Award winning journalist, historian, Director of the
European Institute, Current Professor @ Columbia University, Graduate
from the London School of Economics and Political Science, 7/20/22, "Why
Joe Biden failed"
<https://www.newstatesman.com/world/americas/north-america/2022/07/adam-tooze-why-joe-biden-failed>\
**In the summer of 2022 a trip to Washington DC can seem like a visit to
the scene of a disaster foretold. Having removed [Donald
Trump](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/donald-trump) from office, and
with majorities in both chambers of Congress, the [[Democrats
began]{.mark}]{.underline} 2021 [[with high
ambition]{.underline}]{.mark} and the eyes of the world upon them. [[A
year and a half later, they are facing political
ruin]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[A combination]{.underline}]{.mark} of bad
luck, [[ineptitude, internal divisions]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
structures of US politics and the ruthlessness of their enemies [[has
put]{.underline}]{.mark} not only the future of
the [[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/joe-biden) administration
but the republic itself [[in danger]{.underline}]{.mark}.**

**The fraying of the existing order is visible at all levels.
Internationally, Joe Biden has rallied Nato and its allies against
Vladimir Putin's[ war on
Ukraine](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/ukraine). But the
damage done by decades of misguided US geopolitics cannot be undone and,
despite Russia's flagrant aggression, the kind of global coalition
Washington mobilised against Saddam Hussein has proved elusive.
Meanwhile, the economic fallout from the war in Ukraine will push
weakened institutions of governance to the point of collapse. And as
Washington seeks to cajole "democracies against autocracies" abroad, the
pillars of the US's own liberal regime are under attack. The overturning
of [Roe vs Wade](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/roe-vs-wade) enables
the reactionary denial of reproductive rights across red-state America.
The Supreme Court is also set on demolishing the legal bases for key
environmental regulations.**

**In 2020 the US was on the brink of constitutional crisis. Though
Biden's election victory, and the [Republican
Party's](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/republicans-2) belated
decision to recognise it, upheld American democracy, basic questions
about the country's future remain open. How can the US function when one
party is not only devoted to overturning key compromises and
institutions that have sustained society and government for more than
half a century, but is willing to do so by any means necessary, whether
or not it has majority support? That so many conservatives, and members
of the GOP leadership, believe Biden stole the election is a sign of the
wretched state of affairs. Trump, the chief author of that corrosive
fantasy, lurks in the shadows and, if he can avoid legal
disqualification, whether for his involvement in the Capitol riots on 6
January or other malfeasance, he will likely run again in 2024.**

**Given this alarming constellation of threats, [[one might expect
liberal opinion to rally around]{.underline}]{.mark} Biden. The stakes
could not be higher. His administration can claim some achievements. It
has overseen a remarkable recovery from the [Covid
pandemic](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/covid-19). It passed a \$1trn
infrastructure package, which will improve the country's degraded
transport and communications networks. Unemployment is at record lows in
a number of states.**

**[[But rather than showing a centrist advance, Biden's polling numbers
are plummeting. Even Democrats are unenthusiastic about the prospect of
Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} (seen as old and weak) or Kamala Harris
(floundering as vice-president) running in 2024. Those [[impressions
will only harden when the Democrats lose their majorities in Congress,
as they are expected to in November]{.underline}]{.mark}. That will
allow Republicans to block legislation and to use debt-ceiling
negotiations to shut down the government, as they did in [Barack
Obama's](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/barack-obama) second term.**

**If Biden's plan was to stabilise US democracy with progressive
politics -- an updated New Deal for the 21st century -- [[the conclusion
now is that his presidency has failed.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**comparisons with FDR. The \$1.9trn American Rescue Plan that passed in
March last year was larger than any stimulus measure attempted in the
world. Combined with the Federal Reserve's expansive monetary policy and
a dramatic rebound in the private sector, the US experienced a historic
recovery.**

**[[But Biden's agenda was]{.underline}]{.mark} even
[[bold]{.underline}]{.mark}er. In the spring of 2021 he introduced a
succession of plans -- on infrastructure, climate and welfare -- aimed
at ensuring a greener future. It was the Democrats' version of Trump's
promise to "Make America Great Again" and it embodied a theory of
political change. As with the New Deal in the 1930s, Biden's triple push
on jobs, climate and welfare would build constituencies that entrenched
long-term support for the Democratic Party.**

**[[But only fragments of that agenda have been
realised]{.underline}]{.mark}. What should have been a bold programme of
social and political transformation became an embarrassing case study in
legislative failure.**

**[[The perils of indiscipline]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**Despite Trump's shambolic administration, voters did not decisively
repudiate either him or his party in the elections of November 2020.
Biden won the popular vote, but his victory in the electoral college
depended on the results in three key states: Arizona, Georgia and
Wisconsin. In the congressional elections, the Democrats did poorly.
Their majority in the House fell from 35 to nine seats. It was only the
mobilisation of voters in Georgia that delivered a wafer-thin majority
in the Senate.**

**[[The delicate balance in Congress made it imperative for the
Democrats to maintain party discipline]{.underline}]{.mark}, but this
represents a major challenge. Both the GOP and the Democrats consist of
coalitions of several distinct caucuses. [[These]{.underline}]{.mark}
caucuses [[reflect an electorate as fragmented]{.underline}]{.mark} as
that of any other modern society -- no different from Germany, with its
six-party system, or the shifting coalitions of French or Italian
politics.**

**As in the UK, the US's first-past-the-post majoritarian system fails
to represent this complexity. It forces the two big parties to contain
divergent sectional, ideological and regional interests. Without formal
coalition agreements between these groups, legislation becomes a daily
fight for votes.**

**The left wing of the [Democratic
Party](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/the-democratic-party) carried
energy and ideas into the administration. Embracing Biden's
high-spending agenda, the president's new progressive allies celebrated
a decisive break with the neoliberal corset of the Obama and Clinton
presidencies. But to enact legislation required that Biden secure the
votes not just of the left and the centrists but also the Democratic
right wing, personified by the West Virginian senator Joe Manchin and
Arizona's ideologically idiosyncratic Kyrsten Sinema. Given the
precarious Democratic majority in Congress, every vote counted.**

**This problem of forging majorities was evident from the start.
[[Yet]{.mark} [no deal was made to unify the Democratic Party around a
viable compromise agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The impasse between the
White House and Democratic holdouts in the Senate is surprising since
Biden was touted as a congressional deal-maker.]{.underline}]{.mark}
But, apart from a downsized infrastructure package, [[no major spending
policies have passed]{.underline}]{.mark} since the Rescue Plan.
Manchin's position is unassailable, and he knows it. His West Virginia
seat belongs by right to the Republicans. He has nothing to gain by
supporting Biden's programme. On 14 July Manchin made it clear that no
climate legislation will pass with his vote.**

The bill was released Wednesday after Sen. Joe Manchin and Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced they had agreed to the \$370
billion package.**

**"[[This is a climate suicide pact]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Brett
Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological
Diversity. [["It's self-defeating to handcuff renewable energy
development to massive new oil and gas extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} new leasing required in this [[bill will fan
the flames of the climate disasters torching our
country]{.underline}]{.mark}, and it's a slap in the face to the
communities fighting to protect themselves from filthy fossil fuels."**

**The bill would require the Interior Department to offer at least 2
million acres of public lands and 60 million acres of offshore waters
for oil and gas leasing each year for a decade as a prerequisite to
installing any new solar or wind energy[[. If the department failed to
offer these minimum amounts for leasing, no right of ways could be
granted for any utility-scale renewable energy
project]{.underline}]{.mark} on public lands or waters.**

**In January a federal
judge [overturned](https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/court-massive-offshore-oil-lease-sale-in-gulf-based-on-faulty-legal-analysis-2022-01-27/) the
80 million-acre Gulf of Mexico lease sale because Interior failed to
address the climate harms from developing the leases. The additional
Gulf of Mexico and Alaska lease sales mandated by the bill for 2022 and
2023 were part of a prior five-year leasing plan, but they did not
occur.**

**The Inflation Reduction Act would require offering these minimum lease
amounts for 10 years. [[That translates to more than 600 million acres
of offshore leasing --- four times the size of the entire Gulf of
Mexico]{.underline}]{.mark} outer continental shelf.**

**[[On average the fossil fuel industry has purchased for lease 1
million acres of land every year since 2009. By]{.underline}]{.mark}
requiring 2 million acres per year to be offered for lease --- an area
the size of Yellowstone National Park --- t[[he
legislation]{.underline}]{.mark} all [[but ensures that the fossil fuel
industry will maintain current oil and gas production levels without any
change for the next decade]{.underline}]{.mark}. U[[.S. emissions must
be cut in half over the next nine years to have even a chance of
avoiding catastrophic warming]{.underline}]{.mark}.**

**"[[More oil and gas leasing is completely incompatible with
maintaining a livable planet]{.underline}]{.mark}, so we're forced to
fight this," said Hartl. "This deal is unacceptable. If it passes, we'll
fight every single lease the Interior Department tries to approve. Our
climate and the health of our communities depend on it."**

**Passing new laws to mandate oil and gas leasing would fundamentally
conflict with the Biden administration's climate goals.

#### Sinema is a pharma hack, she won't vote for it

[Sen. Kyrsten [Sinema]{.mark} of Arizona [is]{.mark} said to be [opposed
to]{.mark} the current prescription [drug]{.mark} pricing
[proposals]{.mark} in bills put forth by both the House and Senate, as
well as an alternative from House centrists [that would]{.mark} limit
the drugs subject to Medicare negotiation]{.underline}, according to
unnamed sources cited by Politico. Sinema\'s stance has stalled the
passage of the \$3.5 trillion spending bill crafted by the Biden
administration and fellow Democrats, even though it could jeopardize her
own bipartisan infrastructure bill. Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of
Washington has previously said the majority of the Congressional
Progressive Caucus, which she chairs, would not vote for Sinema\'s
infrastructure bill without first passing the spending package. If
passed, [the \$3.5 trillion spending bill would lower the cost of
certain prescription drugs by instituting reforms and [allow]{.mark}ing
[Medicare to negotiate prices]{.mark},]{.underline} which would save the
federal government \"hundreds of billions\" on health care spending,
according to a memo for Democratic senators. [Since launching her
political career, [Sinema\'s]{.mark} campaign committee [has received
more than \$500,000 in donations from]{.mark} the
[pharma]{.mark}ceutical and health product industries]{.underline},
according to OpenSecrets. [[K]{.mark}aiser [H]{.mark}ealth [N]{.mark}ews
[dubbed Sinema a \"pharma favorite]{.mark} in Congress\" after her
campaign received \$98,500 from PACs run by employees of drug companies
and their trade groups during the 2019-20 election cycle.]{.underline}
One of her largest financial backers has been Amgen, a biotechnology
company that manufactures prescription drugs for individuals with
illnesses that have limited treatment options, such as cancer patients
and chronically ill individuals. Insider reached out to Sinema and her
team but has not received a response. [Many prescription drugs made by
Amgen have hefty price tags. Overall, the company made \$24.24 billion
in global product sales in 2020.]{.underline} Amgen did not respond to
inquiries about whether it lobbied Sinema on prescription drug pricing
reforms or how the bill\'s passage would impact the company\'s bottom
line. In 2021, Amgen has spent \$4.72 million on lobbying Congressional
representatives over 17 bills, the majority of which address issues
related to prescription drug pricing, according to OpenSecrets.
According to Google\'s Transparency Report, a September 9 political ad
for Sinema was paid for by Center Forward, a super PAC dedicated to
supporting the election of centrist Democrats, according to The
Washington Post. In its registration with the Washington, DC, Department
of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, Center Forward lists Libby Greer and
Cindy Brown from the lobbying firm Forbes Tate Partners as governors on
its board. Greer and Brown are lobbyists for several pharmaceutical
companies, including Bayer, Gilead Sciences, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Amgen,
and Merck & Co, according to documents obtained by the Daily Poster and
reviewed by Insider. Greer and Brown did not respond to inquiries about
the scope of their involvement in the Sinema political ads. Center
Forward Executive Director Cori Kramer Smith said that day-to-day
activities, programming, and messaging do not fall under the board\'s
responsibilities. Merck was the second-highest pharmaceutical industry
contributor to Sinema\'s campaign, donating \$20,500 to her campaign
committee and leadership PAC between 2015 and 2020, according to Kaiser
Health News\' \"Pharma Cash to Congress\" tracker. Eli Joseph, the
husband of Sinema\'s chief of staff, Meg Joseph, worked as the executive
director of federal policy and government relations for Merck & Co. from
2012-2015, according to his LinkedIn. Meg Joseph\'s LinkedIn also shows
that she worked as a lobbyist from 2007-2008 at Clark & Weinstock, which
lobbied on behalf of several pharmaceutical companies and major industry
trade groups during her tenure, Salon reported. Neither of the Josephs
responded to inquiries about their previous work as lobbyists or
connections to the pharmaceutical industry. Merck spokesperson John
Cummins said Eli Joseph handled Senate affairs and was not involved in
decisions surrounding House contributions. In addition to Sinema, four
House Democrats are also opposed to direct government negotiation of
drug prices. Reps. Scott Peters, Kurt Schrader, Stephanie Murphy, and
Kathleen Rice voted against advancing a drug-pricing provision on
September 15, although it would be approved later in the day by the Ways
and Means Committee, the Los Angeles Times reported.

**[[Still, one person who spoke to Sinema described her as "frustrated"
at not being looped in]{.underline}]{.mark}, while another person who
talked to her said she was "totally shocked." And [[Republicans think
she's their only chance at stopping the deal.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**["[She was not consulted," said Sen. John Cornyn]{.mark}]{.underline}
([[R-Texas), who worked with Sinema]{.mark}]{.underline} last month to
pass a bipartisan gun safety bill [[and lambasted
Manchin]{.underline}]{.mark} repeatedly over the past 24 hours. By
contrast, he added, [["I know I can trust her]{.mark} when]{.underline}
she tells me something. I'm beginning to think I can't trust other
people around here when they tell me something, because they so
routinely lie about it."**

**[[Democrats convened for a private caucus meeting Thursday morning to
discuss]{.underline}]{.mark} the stunning Wednesday deal. During the
meeting, [[Schumer touted the agreement and urged his caucus to pull out
all the stops in order to get the bill passed]{.underline}]{.mark}
before leaving D.C. for Congress' usual summer recess.**

**[[Sinema did not attend the meeting]{.underline}.]{.mark} And Schumer
repeatedly declined to comment on her potential vote. "You saw what she
said. So I say, no comment. I'm not going to talk about Sinema,
period."**

**Manchin, meanwhile, told reporters he had not spoken to her but said
he hoped "she would be receptive." He added that he's "adamant" on
closing the carried interest loophole.**

**During talks last year on Democrats' party-line vision, Sinema reached
a deal with the White House on a menu of revenue options to finance it.
In March, [she said that a potential
deal](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/02/joe-manchin-democrat-bill-taxes-00013246)
with Manchin "already has enough tax reform options to pay for it."**

**"There's a few rocks in the river in front of us because every
senator, myself included, has something that I wanted in this package
that's not in it," observed Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.). "Getting through
the process from here to completion is going to be an interesting run.
But I'm optimistic we will get there."**

**And some don't think Sinema has any other option but to support the
deal in the end. Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said "her state is going
to need her on this" and she "politically doesn't have a choice."**

**In addition to the whip count, passing the package by next week
without a single GOP vote won't be easy. Democrats are already diving
into a behind-the-scenes scrub to ensure the bill complies with the
special budget rules that allow them to evade a filibuster. But that
slog could eat up pivotal time over the next week --- and result in the
nonpartisan Senate rules referee knocking out portions of the
proposal.**

**And all that could play out in real time, with Democrats forced to
litigate parts of their marquee party-line bill against Republican
challenges as it's being considered on the floor. There's also the
unlimited so-called vote-a-rama spree, where any senator, including
Sinema, can seek to change the bill by offering amendments.**

**In a sign that [[Republicans will put up a tough fight against the
package, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Democrats have
produced "an absolute monstrosity, and we're going to be really
aggressively in opposition]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Furthermore, [**[bipart]{.mark}isan congressional [support]{.mark}**
[for alliances]{.mark} combined [with **strong backing**
**in**]{.mark}side [the]{.mark} U.S. [**military** and]{.mark} from
[**career officials** of]{.mark} the U.S. **foreign policy
[agencies]{.mark}** may [create]{.mark} **unusual
[opportunities]{.mark}** [for **pressure**]{.mark} to sustain
alliances]{.underline}. Whereas throughout most of the postwar period,
the executive branch had the advantage of relative unity compared to
Congress, on alliances the inverse is now true: President Trump and some
of his political appointees find themselves at odds with executive
branch bureaucracies over alliances, while [[Congress has been]{.mark}
relatively **[unified]{.mark}** on]{.underline} some [measures [to **hem
in**]{.mark} the administration]{.underline}. These congressional
initiatives may not only impede presidential moves directly, but they
may strengthen the hand of proponents for alliance commitments within
the administration.

A reasonable observer might nevertheless question whether a deeply
divided Congress in a highly polarized environment has incentives to
take executive-thwarting action. Fortunately, [[Americans **strongly
support**]{.mark} the country's [alliances]{.mark}, suggesting that
efforts by Congress to take affirmative, stabilizing action are likely
to be met with political support]{.underline}, even if voters do not
prioritize this issue and members of Congress see it as ranking lower
than other legislative efforts. [The country has **generally** been
**supportive** of alliances]{.underline}, and remarkably that enthusiasm
has only strengthened since the current president took office,
suggesting that it may be a countervailing reaction to his alliance
detractions. While [domestic support for alliances has generally been
**bipartisan**]{.underline}, however, a partisan divide has emerged
since 2016, with self-identified liberals supporting NATO much more
enthusiastically than their rightleaning counterparts. Support among
Republicans nonetheless remains respectable, though, with the hard core
of the president's base being most opposed to alliances. This suggests
that many members of Congress from both political parties could find
constituency support for alliance-protective measures.47

Additionally, multiple surveys find that Americans would prefer to see
alliances take on a more prominent role in U.S. foreign policy.
Americans generally feel that NATO is underperforming its potential, and
yet the public would like to see Washington maintain or even increase
its commitment to the Atlantic Alliance.48 [[**Public support**
for]{.mark} using U.S. troops to defend key [allies
in]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[**Europe** and **Asia**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [actually **[on the
rise]{.mark}**]{.underline}, while support for unilateral U.S. military
action has been on the wane for some time.49 This evidence suggests that
alliances may serve a useful political role for a war-weary country that
nonetheless hopes to hold on to global leadership. [[For Congress,
opposing]{.mark} presidential **[unilat]{.mark}**eralism [in favor of
**maintaining**]{.mark}]{.underline} or increasing American [**alliance
[commitments]{.mark}** is likely to **reflect public sentiment**, and
therefore [make]{.mark} good **[political sense]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### The plan has [bipartisan]{.underline} support\-\--especially from [key senators]{.underline} like [Manchin]{.underline}

Tom **Donilon 21**, Former National Security Advisor in the Obama
Administration, Interviewed by Jonathan Tepperman, "What Georgia's
Senate Results Mean for Biden's Foreign Policy", Foreign Policy,
1/6/2021,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/01/06/donilon-democrats-georgia-senate-control-biden-foreign-policy/

On Jan. 5, voting concluded in a runoff election for the U.S. state of
Georgia's two Senate seats. These ballots will decide not just who
represents Georgia in Congress's upper house but which party controls
the Senate as a whole: If both [Democratic candidates]{.underline} win,
as seems increasingly likely, their party will [hold 50
seats]{.underline}---enough, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris's
tie-breaking vote, to run things there. But only barely; [[given]{.mark}
the **[razor-thin margin]{.mark}**, **both progressives** and **a few
[center-right senators]{.mark}** (Joe [Manchin]{.mark}, Suzanne
[Collins, and]{.mark} Mitt [Romney) could hold]{.mark} the institution
[**hostage** and complicate]{.mark}]{.underline} President-elect Joe
[[Biden's plans]{.underline}]{.mark}. On Tuesday evening, with the
Georgia results still uncertain, Foreign Policy's editor-at-large
Jonathan Tepperman spoke to Tom Donilon, who served as former President
Barack Obama's national security advisor from 2010 to 2013---another
period when Democrats lacked congressional control---about how the
incoming president can navigate the challenge and find ways to push
through his agenda without legislative support. The following
conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

Jonathan Tepperman: If Democrats don't win both Georgia Senate seats and
Republicans maintain control of the Senate---or even if Democrats do
win, but we end up with a 50-50 split---what kind of obstacles will it
create for President-elect Joe Biden when it comes to foreign policy?

Tom Donilon: Senate control can make a big difference in foreign policy
when it comes to the ability to get key personnel confirmed in a timely
way. In general, though, congressional control matters somewhat less on
foreign and national security issues than it does on domestic issues.
Under the Constitution, the president has broader powers and the ability
to act with dispatch in the areas of foreign policy and national
security. Just look at the Trump administration. President Donald Trump
acted unilaterally---without congressional support---in a long list of
areas: on North Korea, and the JCPOA, and suspending participation in
the World Health Organization, and pulling out of Trans-Pacific
Partnership.

JT: But you also need the Senate's agreement if you want to pass any new
treaties.

TD: I think that the intense polarization of the country and Congress
has already led to fewer and fewer international agreements being sought
as treaties by the executive branch, and they're making agreements by
executive order instead.

JT: Are there any disadvantages to that approach?

TD: It can work pretty well in terms of achieving goals. The downside,
however, is that if you have a dramatic change in outlook from one
administration to the next---if you're succeeded by an administration
like Trump's, which placed very little value on continuity---then the
executive agreement can be unilaterally withdrawn by the next president.

JT: And that does damage to how reliable and dependable other countries
think the United States is.

TD: It does, it does. It can lead the world to have less confidence in
the United States and its state actions. That has been the case during
the Trump administration.

JT: Do you think there are areas where Biden could win bipartisan
support in the next Senate? Or do you think McConnell's policy of "no"
is so absolute that no cooperation will be possible?

TD: I think [[there are areas]{.mark} where [you can **reach agreement**
across the aisle]{.mark}]{.underline}. Number one, I think there is a
real possibility of cooperation on an investment agenda for the United
States to increase American competitiveness in the context of China.

JT: Are you talking about investment in domestic R&D and things like
that?

TD: Yes, domestic investment. On China, I think you could get a
bipartisan agreement on the need for substantial investment in an
American competitiveness to meet the China challenge. Biden talked about
that in his campaign. But people like Republican Senator Marco Rubio
have also talked very seriously about the need for additional investment
in research and development and in education and in infrastructure---the
things that the United States needs to invest at home in order to
compete with China.

I think another [[**example** would be]{.mark} Europe and [NATO, where
Trump]{.mark} had **a profoundly [different relations]{.mark}**hip [with
allies]{.mark} than his predecessors. [Biden]{.mark}]{.underline} has
[[said it's **a priority**]{.mark} **of his** [to
**reestablish**]{.mark} **and strengthen** **[relations]{.mark}**hips
with allies]{.underline}, and I think **[[you]{.underline}]{.mark}**'ll
[[have **congressional support** for that]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### 1AR---AT: PC

**Biden washed away his agenda a long time ago and that's not changing
now, he failed to keep democrats disciplined into a unified front and
failed to pass key agendas because of Sinema and Manchin.**

**Democrats WILL lose midterm and Biden's popularity is CRUMBLING that's
Tooze, there's no reason why this bill won't add to his failures.**

#### No Biden PC -- He's unpopular and top sources say he's weak

Natasha **Korecki 22**; Carol. E Lee, Mike Memoli, Peter Nichoas and
Johnathan Allen 7/29/22, CNBC, all qualified political reporters and
researchers, "Biden's soft power has not been enough to stop would-be
rivals from grabbing the 2024 spotlight",
<https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/29/bidens-soft-power-not-enough-to-stop-rivals-from-grabbing-2024-spotlight.html>\
**White House officials are closely tracking the political activity of
at least half a dozen Democrats seen as potential alternatives to
President Joe Biden in the 2024 election.**

**The administration appears to be parsing the words and deeds of the
rising Democrats across the nation, deploying a charm offensive in
response to those who seem to be getting a bit too ambitious on their
own. **

**[[The strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[which some Democrats close
to the White House say leans too heavily on soft power, and lacks
a]{.underline}]{.mark} traditional [[enforcer]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
[[hasn't been]{.underline}]{.mark} especially [[effective. Biden hasn't
been able to stop Democrats from raising]{.underline}]{.mark} their
national profiles or silence [[doubts within the
party]{.underline}]{.mark} about his inevitability. **

**[[This article is based on interviews with more than two dozen
current]{.underline}]{.mark} and former [[White House officials,
lawmakers, Democratic donors and other sources close
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Biden]{.mark}]{.underline} operation.**

**When Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Gov. Gavin Newsom of
California gained traction by dabbling in national politics, the White
House was quick to host them at separate events. **

**In Washington this month, Newsom assured White House chief of staff
Ron Klain in a private conversation that he is "not interested" in
running for president in 2024, according to a person familiar with the
conversation. **

**Days later, Newsom began running [political ads in Texas attacking
Gov. Greg
Abbott ](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/california-gov-gavin-newsom-running-full-page-ads-texas-rcna39475)on
abortion rights and guns.**

**On Capitol Hill, Biden and top White House officials have had to spend
time co-opting progressive critics who have also spurred talk of 2024
ambitions, including Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., with private praise.**

**And inside the West Wing, the Biden press team has compiled a list of
quotes from would-be rivals insisting they back the president.
(Pritzker, Khanna and Newsom's remarks are all from the same article
in [early
July](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/11/politics/biden-democratic-primary-challenge-2024/index.html).)**

**"Nobody likes seeing somebody taking out coffins for you. It's just
like --- 'Not so fast. I'll make this decision,'" Democratic donor John
Morgan said. "It's like they're going to the swim meet and Biden is the
defending gold medalist. But they all got their swimsuits on underneath
the pants. They're ready to get up there and jump as soon as he says
'go.' They can't be walking around the arena just in a swimsuit because
that would really piss Biden off." **

**[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} keep-frenemies-close [[approach is a sign
that the White House is more worried]{.underline}]{.mark} about his
potential rivals drawing [[contrasts]{.underline}]{.mark} with him [[on
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}, which they've done, according to Biden
allies. Several White House officials insisted in interviews that the
administration is not concerned with or preoccupied by the possibility
of a rare intraparty challenge for an incumbent president. **

**But [[the tactic also reflects the limits of the White House's power
at a time when Biden's approval ratings are in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[tank]{.underline}]{.mark} and as many as three-quarters of Democrats
tell pollsters they would prefer a different nominee in 2024.**

**And with the president making a quick recovery from Covid and striking
a deal with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., to enact more of the White House
agenda, the White House is revisiting plans for what it says will be a
robust travel schedule this fall on behalf of Democratic candidates up
and down the ballot.**

**That belies a recognition, sources close to the White House political
operation say, that [[the president is at a weak political
moment]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[including Biden
himself]{.underline}]{.mark}. When a reporter asked the president
recently what his message was to Democrats who don't want him to seek a
second term, the president snapped back: "Read the polls, Jack. You guys
are all the same. That poll showed that 92% of Democrats, if I ran,
would vote for me."**

**But in [the poll Biden
cited](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/11/us/politics/biden-approval-polling-2024.html),
conducted by The New York Times and Siena College, [[64% of Democrats
reported that they would rather the party nominate someone other than
him. That figure was at 75% in [a CNN
poll](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/cnn-poll-biden-2024/index.html)]{.underline}]{.mark} published
Wednesday. **

**Such polls provide an obvious incentive for other Democrats to start
warming the engines of their campaign machines. But White House allies
say there's no opening.**

**"This is bordering on stupidity," said Democratic strategist Philippe
Reines, a longtime adviser to Hillary Clinton. "If for any reason
Biden's not at the top of the ticket, good luck to anyone denying Kamala
the nomination. Especially a white guy," he said, referring to Vice
President Kamala Harris.**

**Still, some [[Biden allies worry that he isn't equipped
temperamentally to crush potential threats himself, and say that he
hasn't outfitted his political operation]{.mark}]{.underline} with an
invaluable tool: a hatchet man. **

[-- I mean]{.underline}, **[[really]{.underline}]{.mark}**, really

[[This]{.mark} belief that]{.underline} a president\'s [**legislative**
shortcomings are the product of a lack of]{.underline}
**[will]{.underline}** is what some media critics call [the]{.underline}
**[Green Lantern theory]{.underline}** [of the presidency]{.underline}.
The Green Lantern Corps., for those unfamiliar with the DC Comics canon,
are a class of superheroes who can conjure supernatural weapons using
sheer willpower. As in that Ryan Reynolds movie from 2011.

\[CLIP\]

GREEN LANTERN Anything I see in my mind, I can create, I just have to
focus.

CAROL Anything? \[END CLIP\]

BROOKE GLADSTONE But according to Brendan Nyhan, a professor of
government at Dartmouth College and the man who coined the term \"the
Green Lantern theory of the presidency,\" [the idea]{.underline}
**[[overstates]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the [power of the
**executive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. He says that [**even when there\'s a
will**, there may not be a way]{.underline}.

BRENDAN NYHAN My understanding is the Green Lantern Corps have a ring
whose powers are limited only by the wearer\'s willpower. Matt Iglesias
is a blogger, he originally applied that idea to geopolitics. He was
criticizing conservatives who said the failures of U.S. foreign policy
in the post 9/11 era were attributable to a lack of will. And I saw that
same idea as being applicable to domestic politics too, where the
president\'s powers are actually quite limited.

BROOKE GLADSTONE And so all this brings us to the criticism currently
directed at Joe Biden. Many [progressives are upset by the failure to
include the 15 dollar minimum wage, and argued]{.underline} that [Biden
could have done more to **convince**]{.underline} Democratic senators
like Joe **[Manchin]{.underline}** of West Virginia [and]{.underline}
Kyrsten **[Sinema]{.underline}** of Arizona who voted against it. David
**[Sirota]{.underline}** [wrote]{.underline} in The Guardian, he\'s a
former speechwriter for Bernie Sanders, [the famous example
from]{.underline} **[L]{.underline}**yndon **[B]{.underline}**.
**[J]{.underline}**ohnson\'s fight for Medicare [as]{.underline}
**[proof]{.underline}** [that a]{.underline} **[tough
president]{.underline}** [can]{.underline} **[strong arm members of
Congress]{.underline}** [into adopting his goals]{.underline}.

BRENDAN NYHAN Yeah, I think [[that]{.mark} LBJ **[arm twisting
myth]{.mark}**]{.underline} [has been a major **[contribut]{.mark}**or
to Green Lantern style **[discourse]{.mark}** around the president.
[That the president can, through]{.mark} the kind of]{.underline}
**[[cajoling]{.underline}]{.mark}** described in these famous accounts,
[[bring]{.underline}]{.mark} numerous **[[votes]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to his side [in]{.underline} [**Congress**. [It\'s]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[very [difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the president to move
votes in Congress. Ask Barack Obama for most of his time in office. Ask
Donald Trump, ask any occupant of the White House. LBJ came into office
with huge Democratic majorities. Joe [**[Biden]{.underline}** [has a
margin of]{.underline} **[zero]{.underline}**]{.mark} votes in the
Senate. Joe [**[Manchin]{.underline}** [represents a state
where]{.underline}]{.mark} almost **[[70 percent]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of people **[[voted]{.mark} for]{.underline}** Donald [[**Trump**. I\'m
not sure]{.underline} **[what arm twisting could cause him to vote
against his]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**political [interests]{.mark}**.
The **[Dem]{.mark}**ocrat**[s]{.mark}** are an]{.underline} **[anchor
around his neck]{.underline}** politically. [[Withdrawing]{.mark} their
[support]{.mark} from him is]{.underline} [**not some kind of a
threat**. It [probably]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[helps
him]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

BROOKE GLADSTONE Getting back to LBJ, you say that he is one of two main
illustrations that would seem to support the Green Lantern theory. The
other president is Ronald Reagan.

BRENDAN NYHAN Rather than LBJ style arm twisting. [Activists
say]{.underline} that [the president could marshal **public
opinion**]{.underline}, if they only made the case publicly, they could
win over the public to their side and therefore rally Congress to
support their priorities. This was a recurring theme in the Obama years
because he was a quite skilled orator. The [**evidence**, however,
suggests]{.underline} that [presidential speechmaking is
often]{.underline} **[ineffective]{.underline}**. Ronald Reagan wrote in
his own diaries when he was president that his case for aid to the
Contras in Latin America failed to rally support, and reportedly he was
even told by his own pollster that the public comments he was offering
on behalf of the cause were actually making it harder for him by
rallying opposition. And [that\'s the dilemma that presidents
face]{.underline}. David Frum, the conservative commentator, has argued
that [one of the]{.underline} **[most effective communication
strategies]{.underline}** [of the early]{.underline}
**[Biden]{.underline}** [administration has been]{.underline} [**how
little he has talked**. Precisely **because**]{.underline} [it avoids
making him the]{.underline} **[focal point]{.underline}** of a
conversation, [given that [presidents are]{.mark}]{.underline} so
**[[polarizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** in our current era. So, again, the
idea here is [it\'s]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [a case of the
president]{.underline} **[failing to deploy]{.underline}** their public
[**communication powers**, it\'s that those]{.underline} public
communication [[powers are]{.underline}]{.mark} **[highly
[overrated]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Once the president gets the issues
where they don\'t have the votes, sometimes they will try. Barack
[[**Obama** campaigned]{.underline}]{.mark} quite
**[extensively]{.underline}** [on behalf of]{.underline} **[gun
control]{.underline}** and renewed those efforts after high profile mass
shootings. [But [it was]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**fruitless**]{.mark}. He
would campaign]{.underline} on behalf of it [because]{.underline}
**[maybe]{.underline}** [it]{.underline} **[could]{.underline}** help
[move the]{.underline} [**needle**, but]{.underline} [it]{.underline}
**[[never]{.mark} was [enough]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[successfully [enact]{.mark}]{.underline}**
the **[[legislation]{.underline}]{.mark}** the administration was
proposing.

BROOKE GLADSTONE You suggested that it\'s worth paying attention to what
Biden doesn\'t say as much as he does say. Like he didn\'t talk publicly
about the impeachment vote.

BRENDAN NYHAN That\'s right. He\'s stayed away from so many
controversies like vaccines, where it\'s very important for everyone in
this country to get vaccinated, and for that not to be seen as a
partisan or polarizing issue. And so the administration\'s communication
strategy very much emphasizes local and community leaders and trusted
sources rather than national political figures who could be more
polarizing. That may be a smart kind of communication strategy in 21st
century America. [Liberals]{.underline} in particular [want to
believe]{.underline} in [a]{.underline} **[West Wing version of the
world]{.underline}** [where]{.underline} **[oratory wins]{.underline}**
people over, [and [that\'s]{.mark}]{.underline} just **[[not a way
politics works]{.underline}]{.mark}** and presidents learn that over and
over again.

BROOKE GLADSTONE Of course, the Biden style is the exact opposite of
Trump, who you called in 2015, the purest Green Lantern candidate we\'ve
seen in recent years. What do you mean?

BRENDAN NYHAN Donald Trump again and again claimed that he would make
things happen through sheer force of will. He would cut the best deals.
This was most often expressed when it came to trade. Change the balance
of trade with China, reverse the decline of American manufacturing.

\[CLIP\]

TRUMP Politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing\'s gonna to get done.
They will not bring us, believe me, to the promised land. \[END CLIP\]

BRENDAN NYHAN He promised everything to everyone. And we saw how limited
his powers of persuasion were, even in a party that was enthralled to
him. Republicans are terrified of being on the wrong side of Donald
Trump politically. They\'re extremely unwilling to support his
impeachment, to call out his attacks on the integrity of the election or
to denounce the scandals. But when it came to legislation, the
Republican Party did what the Republican Party wanted to do for the most
part. Donald Trump\'s signature legislative achievement was a
conventional Republican tax cut. His health care policy was a
conventional health care policy proposal from the Republican side, which
ultimately failed. The only areas where he was able to really change the
direction of the party on policy were those that didn\'t require votes
in Congress. He faced all the same legislative constraints that have
frustrated past presidents and was not able to bluster past them.
However, we discovered during the Trump presidency that we depended on
the president respecting the democratic norms of our system, such as not
calling for the imprisonment of your political opponents or attacking
the integrity of an election in which you were defeated. Those norms can
be overridden through sheer force of will. Donald Trump was willing to
cross those lines in a way that past presidents weren\'t. We should not
only recognize how frequently presidents overstate their ability to get
what they want but be wary of what happens when they actually succeed.

[[The bill does not]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[address]{.mark} one
of [the biggest hurdle]{.mark}s [facing renewable energy]{.mark}: [a
lack of long-distance power lines to]{.mark} help [bring]{.mark} wind
and solar [power to]{.mark} cities from far-flung [rural
regions]{.mark}. An earlier version of the bill had included tax credits
for new transmission, but that was removed.]{.underline} Without that
provision, [[many wind and solar projects could struggle to get
built]{.underline}]{.mark}, said Rob Gramlich, founder of Grid
Strategies.

[In the longer term[, the]{.mark} tax [incentives]{.mark} in the bill
[are expected to nurture emerging tech]{.mark}nologies [like carbon
capture]{.mark} for industrial facilities such as steel and cement,
next-generation nuclear reactors and the use of hydrogen as a low-carbon
fuel.]{.underline} Many of [[these tech]{.mark}nologies [are too
costly]{.mark} for widespread use today]{.underline}, but the hope is
that by creating a market for an initial round of projects, costs could
be driven down --- much as federal tax credits in the 2000s and 2010s
helped transform wind and solar power from a pricey niche technology
into an affordable mainstream option.

[[The bill]{.mark} does [provide some support for fossil fuels]{.mark},
a concession]{.underline} widely seen as necessary to win support from
Mr. Manchin, whose home state of West Virginia is rich in coal and
natural gas. For instance, [[the bill would mandate new]{.mark} lease
[sales for oil drilling]{.mark} in the Gulf of Mexico, something
environmental groups had opposed and Mr. Biden had promised to
halt]{.underline} as a candidate for the White House.

"It is truly all of the above, which means this bill does not
arbitrarily shut off our abundant fossil fuels," Mr. Manchin said in a
statement. He called the package "a "realistic energy and climate
policy."

As part of the agreement, Mr. [[Manchin]{.mark} said he had also
[secured]{.mark} a [commitment]{.mark} from]{.underline}
[both]{.underline} Mr. [Biden and]{.underline} Speaker Nancy
[Pelosi]{.underline} of California [that Congress would approve a
separate measure [to address the permitting of]{.mark} energy
infrastructure, potentially including natural [gas
pipelines]{.mark}]{.underline}, before the end of the fiscal year on
Sept. 30.
