NATOs cyber-resilience experienced in crisis management and
communication

[Societal [security]{.mark}]{.underline}, an emerging phenomenon in the
field of strategy and security, [[requires **good**]{.mark} crisis
management skills but also [**communication**]{.mark} effectiveness in
both the real and virtual worlds. **Business continuity** at NATO
requires]{.underline} as foresaid the Alliance, to be resilient and
surely for the purposes of this research paper, the Alliance and [allies
to be]{.underline} or become [cyber-resilient.]{.underline}

[By methodological approach, societal vulnerability continues and will
always continue to exist, so far and as long as threats are
there]{.underline}. Considering the current civil need to be always
preparing for a new "cold era," among others, considering the unlawful
annexation by Russia of Crimea in 2014 (BBC, 2014) and following the
disintegrating relations of NATO due to the unlawful act of Russia to
Ukraine, the establishment of the USA and then taken over by NATO, of
the Missile installation in Romania (Reuters, 2016) and the immediate
reaction and accusation of Russia in regard to these developments (New
York Times, 2016), the refugee challenges as an outcome on the constant
fight against ISIS (US Homeland Security Committee, 2015), but also the
phenomenal changes in the financial world (i.e., The Panama Papers (The
International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICJ), 2016)),
[NATO is required to become truly resilient NATO, as should also nations
and leaders.]{.underline}

[All aforementioned elements are crisis management factors. NATO
provides the **tools** and **method**ologie**s**, in which the Alliance
is requested to reply strategically and operationally. To mitigating
plans for pre-crisis, during crisis and after crises situations. For and
during operations, logistics of deployment or information gathering and
or training purposes, among others.]{.underline}

In such similar cases, [the [**legal** and **political
perspectives**]{.mark} also [on **cyber**]{.mark} operations [should be
**clear**]{.mark}. The **[success]{.mark}** of an operation [lays to
**effective logistical** and **operational support**]{.mark}. Therefore,
[the legal aspects that come with **sharing**]{.mark} of
**[info]{.mark}**rmation, on [how to **deploy forces**, identify **key
threats**]{.mark} and elements in cyber-space, [are
**important**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Internet has no borders. And
threats can easily infiltrate the national e-space and boundaries.
[Leaders are welcomed upon to take strong strategic-led
decisions.]{.underline}

[NATO is to ensure protection of all infrastructure. The Allies should
be able to **anticipate**, **identify**, **mitigate**, and **recover**
from "hybrid attacks]{.underline} (NATO Review, 2016)"---[the
dimension(s) of simultaneous attacks, while reducing the threat of
destabilization and or spreading fear.]{.underline}

[In a civic society, it is our **responsibility** to ensure adequate
**awareness** on cyber-defense and security. [To **learn** about the
**necessity**]{.mark} [to protect]{.mark} all [infrastructures]{.mark},
**[NATO's collective defense should be characterized by]{.mark}**
**[burden sharing]{.mark}**, **[openness]{.mark}**, flexibility, [and
**transparency** in coop]{.mark}eration and **[info]{.mark}**rmation
[**flow** among **member**]{.mark} state**[s]{.mark}**. [Through
**preparedness**]{.mark}, strategic and operational awareness,
**[strategic resilience can be achieved]{.mark}**. Response time and
framework will then allow NATO to counter threats as they
emerge.]{.underline}

**[BUT,]{.underline} tech investment [without clarifying article 5
first]{.underline} causes [offensive ops]{.underline}\-\--those escalate
and turn the DA**

[Against the backdrop of a fast-developing **cyber threat
landscape**]{.underline}, [[NATO]{.mark} has [**struggled**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[enact a]{.mark} **[comprehensive
strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that]{.mark} **sufficiently [prepares
allies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to **deter** or **defend**]{.underline}
[themselves [against]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While important steps have been
taken, the alliance is still nowhere near ready to face cyber threats at
the 'speed of relevance'. **[[Individual]{.mark}
[members']{.mark}]{.underline}** guarantees to use their **[[cyber
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** on behalf of the alliance -- as the
United States announced this year -- can help [[fill]{.mark} that
[gap]{.mark} in strategy.]{.underline}

[**[Yet]{.underline}**, [without a **well-defined**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[policy agreement]{.underline}** [between]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[member s]{.mark}tates]{.underline} and a clear command structure in
overseeing NATO operations, [[this]{.mark} approach **[risks unintended

**[cascad]{.mark}ing** [into **conventional conflict**]{.mark}**.** [To
**prevent**]{.mark} [such a scenario]{.mark}, allies should]{.underline}
further **[formalize]{.underline}** [their **cyber
strategy**]{.underline} [through]{.underline} top-down
**[guidance]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[increase]{.underline}**
their **[cooperation]{.underline}** with partners [to broaden their
spectrum of potential responses]{.underline}. **[Most

**streamline**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[its]{.underline}
**[decision-making]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[process]{.underline}**
[[in]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} domain]{.underline}

**Grand is about ambiguity in respect to [adversaries

[What to do? Develop norms as to the "red lines"]{.underline}

[I]{.underline}t [is vitally important]{.underline}, however, [to
appreciate that simply [because]{.mark} [a]{.mark} particular [cyber act
may]{.mark} **[legally constitute]{.mark}** [an "armed
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} [that might]{.underline}
**[qualify]{.underline}** [for the political characterization of an "act
of war," [that doesn't mean]{.mark} [that a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[country is **obliged to respond**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to it [with
force]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [there are many political reasons
that would counsel against doing so]{.underline}. This is where Mr.
Painter goes wrong with his discussion about "strategic ambiguity."

[[In deterrence, **ambiguity** may be **useful** with respect to a
**response**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but]{.mark} it is **markedly [less
so]{.mark}** []{.mark}when you are talking [about the
**threshold**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[Misunderstandings]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[as to]{.mark} where the
proverbial "**[red lines]{.mark}**]{.underline}["]{.mark} [are set [can
lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[dangerous
[miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}**, **[unintended
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[unwanted [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Given the **enormous
potential** of cyber acts to do harm, potential [actors ought not to get
**mixed messages** as to how the U.S. considers **harmful cyber
activities.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Frustrations with the **opaqueness**]{.underline} [as what cyber
activity would constitute a casus belli appears to have motivated
Congressman Mike Rounds to propose a bill earlier this year that would
require the President to develop a policy for determining "when an
action carried out in cyberspace constitutes an act of war against the
U.S."]{.underline}

Rounds points to testimony of Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, director
of the Defense Intelligence Agency, as part of his rational for the
legislation. Stewart admitted that a "much fuller definition of the
range of things that occur in cyber space \[is needed\], and then \[we
should\] start thinking about the threshold where an attack is
catastrophic enough or destructive enough that we define it as an act of
war, I think that would be extremely helpful."

Stewart isn't alone in not "fully" understanding where the threshold
lies. [Other **Pentagon leaders** apparently are equally
**uncertain**]{.underline}, [something that raises the obvious question:
**if our leaders don't know**]{.underline}, [how can we expect
**potential adversaries** to understand which acts might **spark a
full-blown war?**]{.underline} At the same time, except in the most
aggravated cases, [enumerating **in advance** precisely]{.underline}
[which cyber acts exceed the use of force threshold might be nearly
impossible.]{.underline}

[[This is where **norm development**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in
international law [comes into play]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In
doing so, the U.S. needs to use the language of international law.
Political terms like "digital acts of war" are unhelpful not only
because they do not track with the language of the law, they also can
imply to the general public a level of response that is unnecessarily
provocative and even inconsistent with the proportionality and necessity
factors intrinsic to a lawful exercise of self-defense, especially in
the complex cyber arena.

**Innovation is [stalling]{.underline}.**

Christopher **Cole 21**, partner at Crowell Moring, "Lawmakers Worry
Rampant Mergers Crushing US Innovation," Law360, lexis.

[**[Innovation]{.underline}** [across the]{.underline}]{.mark} [U.S.
[economy]{.mark} has [suffered as **antitrust laws fall short**]{.mark}
in **stopping** predatory]{.underline} **[merger deals]{.underline}**
[and enforcers allow **massive industry consolidation**]{.underline} to
continue **[unabated]{.underline}**, **[[experts
said]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[Wednesday]{.underline}** on Capitol Hill.

[[In the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[latest congressional
hearing]{.underline}]{.mark}** [focused on **possible overhauls** of
**American competition laws**]{.underline} [to deal with **industry
concentration** in sectors ranging from **technology** to
**pharmaceuticals**, **real estate** and **agriculture**,]{.underline} a
Senate panel zeroed in on the impact of monopolies on the development of
cutting-edge products and services.

[Antitrust]{.underline} **[advocates]{.underline}** [and **business
[figures]{.mark}** [**testified**]{.mark}]{.underline} [that
[the]{.mark} U.S. [economy faces a **growing threat**
from]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[large companies\']{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[m]{.underline}**erger [and]{.underline} **[a]{.underline}**cquisition
[[strategies]{.mark} [that]{.mark} aim to **[knock out
startups]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} growing
**[rivals]{.underline}**, [then [**take advantage** of **market
power**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} continue **profiting off old
technologies**. The trend **[stifle]{.mark}s U.S. [innovation]{.mark}**
and **harms consumers**,]{.underline} they said.

Senators looked to the experts to inform the lawmakers\' biggest push in
years to revamp antitrust laws, including a major bipartisan bill
introduced in October, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act.
The bill would make it harder for online sales platforms to
self-preference their own products. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and
Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, are lead sponsors of the bill, one of numerous
antitrust proposals circulating on Capitol Hill.

\"It\'s always been innovation that has fueled the American economy,\"
said Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate Judiciary antitrust panel, but
that \"cannot thrive without open and competitive markets.\"

[[Monopoly power]{.underline}]{.mark} is on the increase in industries
\"from cat food to caskets,\" Klobuchar said, and that
**[[stifles]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the [ability of **new
companies**]{.mark} that may develop **better products**]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} **[services]{.underline}** [[to **gain
funding**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[enter the
market]{.mark} competitively]{.underline}**. \"We also have to remember
that **[[innovation is all about competition]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\"
she said.

Utah Sen. Mike Lee, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, also
voiced concern about consolidation suffocating the economy. Lee said
that \"I\'m a huge advocate of the consumer welfare standard\" that
federal courts use to assess whether market behavior is unlawfully
anticompetitive but \"when competition suffers, so does innovation.\"

\"One might say that competition is itself the mother of innovation,\"
said Lee, who has been working closely with Klobuchar and Grassley, the
full committee\'s ranking Republican, on antitrust legislation this
year.

Still, Lee said lawmakers and enforcers must take care not to carry out
\"regulatory overreach\" that ends up protecting no one except market
incumbents when they make it harder for startups to succeed. Lee touted
Utah\'s \"pro-free market\" approach that he said has been a magnet for
new businesses and driven the quality of life higher in the Beehive
State. \"I do worry, however, that D.C. bureaucrats may spoil the party
for everyone,\" he said.

Conservatives also voiced concern that consolidation of power in Big
Tech has allowed the top companies to rein in free speech, and Lee
pointed to the controversy over the startup social media platform
Parler, which almost sunk amid the turmoil over the 2020 election.

The vast technology sector was only one aspect of Wednesday\'s hearing,
however, as several witnesses talked about growing monopolies in pharma,
real estate and other parts of the economy where they said behemoths\'
market power was holding back innovation.

Diana Moss, president of American Antitrust Institute, told senators
there are many reasons that innovation is currently struggling in the
U.S. economy. She said the financial markets\' \"laser focus on
shareholder returns\" based on the bottom line and short-term profits
was making it more difficult for companies to invest in much-needed
research and development.

\"Another reason is weaker antitrust enforcement over the last 40
years,\" Moss said.

Alex Harman, competition policy advocate at Public Citizen, the
liberal-leaning advocacy group, called unfettered merger and acquisition
activity and the massive buildup of a small number of companies \"one of
the most critical issues of our time.\" Harman said [[there had been an
\"**alarming increase** in]{.mark} **[consolidation]{.mark}** throughout
the economy.\"]{.underline}

Another witness, Roger [Alford, a professor at Notre Dame Law School,
identified]{.underline} **[multiple competitive problems]{.underline}**
[rippling through the economy]{.underline}. One of the sectors
**[hard-hit]{.underline}** [by a]{.underline} resulting **[lack of
innovation]{.underline}** is real estate sales, said Alford, a former
deputy assistant attorney general with the U.S. Department of Justice
Antitrust Division.

**[Innovation DA\-\--AT: China Impact]{.underline}**

**AFF solves Chinese hybrid threat by [contingency
planning]{.underline}\-\--that's key to security**

Lauren **Speranza 20**, director for trans-Atlantic defense and security
at the Center for European Policy Analysis, 7/8/20, "China Is NATO's New
Problem,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/08/china-nato-hybrid-threats-europe-cyber/

[Over the past decade]{.underline}, [Chinese companies]{.underline} have
[invested billions]{.underline} of dollars [throughout
Europe]{.underline}---[buying up **critical
infrastructure**]{.underline} [and increasing Beijing's **political
clout**]{.underline} [across the continent]{.underline}. As Chinese
firms, often with strong ties to the state and Chinese Communist Party
(CCP), acquire parts of sensitive ports, pipelines, and
telecommunication networks, [China's incursions into Europe's security
umbrella are drawing serious concern.]{.underline}

[But **NATO**]{.underline}, long worried about Russia, [has largely been
silent on China]{.underline}. **[Now]{.underline}**, [that is
changing]{.underline}. [NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg recently
called on the alliance to stand up to Beijing's "bullying and coercion,"
underscoring how China's rise is fundamentally shifting the global
balance of power]{.underline}. **[It's apparent]{.underline}** that
[[NATO]{.mark} can **no longer ignore the threat**]{.underline}. [If the
alliance hopes to **remain competitive**]{.underline}, [it [will
need]{.mark}]{.underline} to develop [a **new strategy** for dealing
with Beijing]{.underline}.

First, [NATO needs a **common [assessment of China's hybrid
threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[a mix of diplomatic, economic,
security, information, and technological actions designed to quietly
**undermine democratic states and institutions**]{.underline} [to
Beijing's benefit while avoiding a traditional conflict]{.underline}.
While [China's]{.underline} conventional military threat in the
Indo-Pacific is far from NATO's borders, its [hybrid activities are
happening in the alliance's own backyard]{.underline}.

**[[Cyber-espionage]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntellectual
**[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**roperty **[[theft]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[infiltration of critical infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[debt manipulation]{.underline}**, [[and
**disinfor**]{.mark}**mation**]{.underline} [are prime
examples]{.underline}. [While these threats may **seem** to fall outside
of NATO's purview]{.underline}, [they [pose]{.mark} serious security
[risks]{.mark} for the alliance]{.underline}. For instance,
[China's]{.underline} desire to invest in Lithuania's Klaipeda Port may
not look like a problem for NATO on its surface. But its investments
have worrying strings attached that give China [operating control
over]{.underline} the [infrastructure]{.underline}. That control [could
decrease **allies' willingness to move military
forces**]{.underline}---**[including sensitive
technologies]{.underline}**---through the port and its surrounding
networks. [This could]{.underline} lead to [disrupt]{.underline}ed
[planning and]{.underline} fewer [military exercises]{.underline},
[decreasing NATO's ability to defend the Baltic States during a crisis
with Russia]{.underline}. [This could also open the door for **pragmatic
collaboration between China and Russia** to undermine trans-Atlantic
security.]{.underline}

[Allies need to forge a **shared understanding** of these risks through
**information-sharing and dialogue**]{.underline}---[no small feat for
countries that do not see eye to eye on China. Some are even willing to
ignore such vulnerabilities, due to economic benefits or disenchantment
with trans-Atlantic institutions]{.underline}. [[The
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has]{.mark} a **critical role** [to]{.mark} play in [get]{.mark}ting
[allies **on the same page**]{.mark} and **setting common goals** for
countering China's hybrid activities]{.underline}.

Second, NATO needs to focus on public diplomacy. **[NATO]{.underline}**
[has an important role to play in the battle against the CCP's global
narratives, which Beijing promulgates through **hybrid
activities**]{.underline}. [[To defend]{.underline}]{.mark} the
trans-Atlantic values on which the alliance is built---freedom,
**[[democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[rule of
law]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and **human
rights**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[NATO should clearly communicate China's
violations]{.underline} of these principles and its propaganda efforts
to cover them up. (These include, among others, human rights abuses
against ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang and violations of the U.N. Convention
on the Law of the Sea in the South China Sea.) NATO should also enhance
its outreach to key partners in the Indo-Pacific, such as Australia,
Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea, which can serve as important
counterweights to Chinese influence in the region. Effective public
messaging also means getting serious about attributing the blame for
attacks, as the European Commission recently did over Chinese
disinformation around COVID-19, to raise the pressure on Chinese
officials. [Trans-Atlantic countries have **struggled to shape China's
behavior** because they cannot prove malign intent or agree to call out
Beijing for its subversive efforts. [Allies should develop **clearer
guidelines**]{.mark}---**what needs to be proved**, **by whom**, **and
to what degree**---[to enable **collective attribution**]{.mark}. NATO
is strongest when it speaks with one voice. It should use that voice to
demand transparency and change from China.]{.underline}

Third, the alliance should step up its counteroffensive. [China's
[hybrid actions]{.mark} intentionally [**blur the lines**]{.mark}
between what is **legally permissible**]{.underline}, **[politically
inappropriate]{.underline}**, [and **downright
escalatory**]{.underline}.

[This [makes it difficult]{.mark} for leaders [to determine
**appropriate responses**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [producing a
reactionary approach]{.underline} **[thus far]{.underline}**. [But an
intensifying geostrategic competition has already begun. To compete in
this environment, the trans-Atlantic community needs [a **more proactive
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather than waiting for China to invest
in the next major European port, allies should coordinate legislation to
prevent the riskiest Chinese acquisitions. And rather than waiting for
more Chinese cyberintrusions, allies should collaborate on responsible,
targeted offensive cyberactions. Over time, this
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} help [**[dissuade China]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline}]{.mark} [manipulating investments in critical
infrastructure, [conducting]{.mark} cyber-espionage, and other [hybrid
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}. While adopting [a more offensive
posture]{.underline} remains controversial among certain allies, it [is
**gaining traction across Europe**]{.underline} and is **[strongly
supported in Washington]{.underline}**. [Although NATO]{.underline},
**[as a defensive alliance]{.underline}**, [should not
implement]{.underline} such [a counteroffensive]{.underline},
[policymakers should **leverage it** as the **primary forum** to
**coordinate actions among willing nations**]{.underline}.

Fourth, NATO needs to deepen its cooperation with other key players,
such as the European Union and the private sector. Where NATO lacks the
mandate and means, the EU and multinational businesses play critical
roles in developing, implementing, and enforcing the legislation and
financial incentives necessary to counter Chinese hybrid threats.
Complementary to that, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and its allies [[can
focus on]{.mark} providing intelligence, defending cyberspace,
developing capability targets for new technologies, conducting exercises
and **[contingency planning]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [informing
resilience requirements for secure infrastructure, and bolstering
deterrence]{.underline}. Despite the political obstacles that impede
more formal NATO-EU cooperation, allies should look to the European
Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki to bring
together NATO and EU staff, national officials, and industry voices in
one place to align their counter-hybrid policies for China.

[The Chinese government's manipulative efforts around the coronavirus
have thrust China's hybrid activities to the center of trans-Atlantic
debates. Policymakers need to **seize the moment** and respond by
**"using NATO more politically,"**]{.underline} in Stoltenberg's words.
NATO is first and foremost about its nations. [In the fight against
China's hybrid threats, these nations bring much more to the table than
military power alone. They have access to a broad range of
tools---military, political, economic, technological, and
information---which the alliance can use to its collective geopolitical
advantage in the competition with China. What NATO needs now is a
strategy to leverage those tools in a **coordinated manner**. That will
go a long way in solving NATO's China problem.]{.underline}

[[China's]{.mark} territorial ambitions as a 'hybrid
threat'?]{.underline}

[China has participated in **more territorial disputes**]{.underline}
[than]{.underline} **[any other state]{.underline}** since the end of
the Second World War.40 [Many of these disputes could be considered
**expansionism**]{.underline}, with the exception of Taiwan, which has
remained a reunification objective of the People's Republic of China
(PRC) since 1949. [The [disputes include]{.mark} **land border claims**
and counter-claims, such as with]{.underline} **[India]{.underline}**,
[and arguments with **Hong Kong**]{.underline} [over its **separate
legal system**]{.underline} [are also increasingly a **source of
tension**.]{.underline} However, the [primary focus]{.underline} of
Chinese expansionism [tends to be in the **maritime environment** with
disputes over]{.underline} the [Paracel and Spratly [Islands in the
**South China Sea**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the
**[Senkaku Islands]{.underline}** [in the **East China
Sea.**]{.underline}

[The Chinese maritime disputes]{.underline} especially in the South
China Sea [are **complex**]{.underline}, [involving multiple overlapping
claims with other regional states but also with other stakeholders who
seek peaceful resolution]{.underline} of claims [and]{.underline}
assurance of [freedom of navigation]{.underline}. The [establishment of
military facilities on the islands, in breach of a ruling of its claim
by The Hague]{.underline}, **[exacerbated the situation]{.underline}**,
leading US and other navies to conduct regular freedom of navigation
exercises through the South China Sea.

In addition to China's ambitions associated with territory in its direct
proximity, China has developed a strategy for its future economy with
the Belt and Road Initiative. Critics of this strategy assert that the
associated infrastructure elements of the initiative are essentially an
alternative means of securing key overseas territory, or a new form of
colonialism.41 An obvious example of this strategy is China's effective
acquisition of the port of Hambantota in Sri Lanka.42

[China's approach to its territorial claims is one in which changes are
implemented **incrementally** and thereafter **become the new normal**.
Occupation of South China Sea islands is an example, in]{.underline}
[which China's 2019 Defence White Paper **characterises**]{.underline}
[international **freedom of navigation** as 'countries from outside the
region]{.underline}... **[illegally]{.underline}** [entering **China's
territorial waters**]{.underline}... **[undermining China's national
security']{.underline}**.43

In a 2010 article, [Fravel asserted that China was unlikely to resort to
armed conflict or even aggressive expansionism in pursuing their
territorial claims]{.underline}. 44 **[However]{.underline}**, since
that publication, [we have seen examples]{.underline} in the East and
South China Seas [in which **aggression**]{.underline} [has been
**clear**]{.underline}, [with challenges between **military
platforms**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [with conflict often
**narrowly averted.**]{.underline}

[Despite these tensions and occasional incidents]{.underline}, [China's
conduct of expansionism in the South China Sea primarily has been in the
**grey-zone**]{.underline}, in that [each]{.underline} [step has been
**calculated** to **achieve objectives**]{.underline} [**without
crossing a threshold of** **warfare**.]{.underline} However, [can we
consider it to be hybrid warfare?]{.underline} That is, has the
posturing of forces been complemented by other activities to achieve
their goals? Hoffman regards China as being 'well organized to conduct
operations short of military conflict'45 utilising three forms of
nonwarfare, namely noncontact (fei jierong), nonlinear (fei xianshi) and
nonsymmetric (fei duicheng)'.46

Such influence activities are widely suspected to be behind the
Philippines government's softening of their stance against China in
relation to the South China Seas dispute.47 Such influence may be
overtly undertaken through incentives such as Belt and Road Initiative
agreements, although there is evidence that such initiatives can have a
covert element and take advantage of corrupt regimes.48 Influence can
extend to attempted corruption of Western politicians to advocate for
Chinese policies over the dispute.49 China more broadly exerts influence
through a combination of political warfare activities, including
mobilisation of diasporas, tasking of students, financial assistance to
individuals and institutions, economic manipulation and large-scale
cyber and other information operations.50

Hybrid Lawfare -- exploiting the legal grey-zone of modern conflict

[Hybrid warfare is an open concept with different elements. Lawfare, for
example, is a new aspect of non-kinetic conflict aiming at 'using law as
a weapon to manipulate legal paradigms'.]{.underline}51

[Lawfare is being used by **Russia** and]{.underline}
**[China]{.underline}** ([in the context of the South China Sea as
discussed in this article]{.underline}) both within and outside the
scope of traditional armed conflict. For Russia the use of lawfare is 'a
continuation of its policy of using every tool at its disposal to
achieve its political and geo-strategic goals'52 and a 'force
multiplier' to meet its political, military and legal objectives, as
highlighted in its Military Doctrine of 2014 and its National Security
Strategy of 2015.

[Both China and Russia have been active in the **use** and **abuse** of
the **rule of law** in]{.underline} [order to either **prepare military
action** or]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[justify it]{.underline}**
[**after completion** of the mission]{.underline}. [Russian
justification of the occupation and]{.underline} then subsequent
[annexation of Crimea is an example of the latter]{.underline}; while
the [Chinese justification for its claims over the South China Sea is an
example of the preparation of a legal basis for the potential use of
force in self-defence]{.underline} when protecting own sovereign rights
and (island-) territory.

[Lawfare in conjunction with hybrid warfare 'provides a **layer of
"fake" legitimacy**]{.underline}, or at least [reduces]{.underline} the
[erosion of **apparent legitimacy**]{.underline}, [due to]{.underline}
the **[nonattributable aspects]{.underline}** [inherent in hybrid
warfare]{.underline} while using "easy" hybrid warfare methods'.53
[Lawfare can be used as a method of hybrid warfare or influence
operations]{.underline}.54 US writer, Kittrie came up with the following
test: (1) the actor uses law to create the same or similar effects as
those traditionally sought from conventional kinetic military
actions---including impacting the key armed forces decision-making and
capabilities of the target; and (2) one of the actor's motivations is to
weaken or destroy an adversary against which the lawfare is being
deployed.55

Russia's use of lawfare in Ukraine thus exploits both (1) the undefined
definition of the conflict as aggression and (2) the unwillingness of
the international community to label it as such. And, it maintains
uncertainty through a strategic (dis)information campaign which keeps
the nature of the conflict open, so it is unclear whether it is
international armed conflict, non-international armed conflict or civil
unrest.56 Here clear parallels regarding China's actions in the South
China Sea can be drawn.

China and Russia's use of the 'weaponisation' of the maritime
environment as grey-zone tactics or consolidation of a hybrid warfare
based approach

We are now turning to the example for such a lawfare approach: the
so-called weaponising of the maritime environment through terraforming
as part of a multifaceted security strategy. [China's Defence Minister,
Wei Fenghe, argued]{.underline} in 2018 that, '[The islands in the South
China Sea have long been China's territory]{.underline}. They're the
legacy of our ancestors and we can't afford to lose a single inch of
them'.57

[Officially]{.underline}, [China claims]{.underline} that [its overall
intention was to use the extension of its territorial waters peacefully
and to serve solely its commercial needs]{.underline}. [This is
**doubtful**, given that China has **actively weaponised** the **claimed
territories**.]{.underline} Sumihiko Kawamura, a former rear admiral and
commander of Japan's Maritime Self-Defence Force's antisubmarine air
wing, suspects that [China wants to use the South China Sea as leverage
against the US Pacific security projection.]{.underline} Kawamura
believes [Beijing is trying to turn the South China Sea into 'a **safe
haven'**]{.underline} [for its **nuclear-powered
submarines**]{.underline}, [which are **armed with ballistic missiles**
that can reach the United States]{.underline}. 58

In this context, it [is worthwhile to note that China did **lose its
case** for claiming the SCS waters in a 2015 case brought before the UN
Permanent Court of Arbitration by]{.underline} one of the affected
states, [the Philippines. China therefore failed]{.underline}
spectacularly [with its attempt to successfully use lawfare]{.underline}
by manipulating the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea to argue own sovereign rights (like exclusive economic
and fishing rights) over the majority of the SCS waterways.59 [China
later decided to **ignore the ruling**]{.underline} [and to
**consolidate its illegal position**]{.underline} [further by
**illegally maintaining**, and even **expanding**]{.underline},
[so-called **E**xclusive **E**conomic **Z**one**s**]{.underline} [in the
disputed SCS waters]{.underline}.60 [This consolidation manifests
itself]{.underline} in Chinese **[below the threshold]{.underline}**
**[grey-zone tactics]{.underline}** [like]{.underline}
**[policing]{.underline}** [its falsely claimed territorial waters
around]{.underline} **[artificially built islands]{.underline}**,
**[interference]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}
**[air-traffic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[challenging US and
allied navies]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} [their rightful freedom of
seas navigation patrols]{.underline}, to name just a few examples.61
[China has created, like Russia in respect to the illegally annexed
Crimea, **a fait accompli.**]{.underline}

In Russia's case, immediately following the annexation of Crimea in
2014, Russia began the planning and construction of the Crimean Bridge
over the Kerch Strait in Ukraine to support its territorial claims. The
project was successfully completed in May 2018 as the so-called
Unification Bridge and was followed subsequently by Russian military
action to ensure regional observance of the new status quo.62 Russian
naval units attacked and boarded three Ukrainian vessels in autumn 2018
for having allegedly violated Russian territorial waters when passing
through the Kerch Strait.63 What became known as the 'Kerch Strait'
incident was followed by the effective closure of a part of the Sea of
Azov waterway whenever Russia decided to conduct live fire naval
exercise,64 thus violating Ukrainian territorial waters, as the
annexation of Crimea was and continues to be regarded as illegal.65

Russia's actions can be seen as consolidation action of its gains from
its successful hybrid warfare campaign against the Ukrainian state when
seizing Crimea. With the annexation complete and little to fear in terms
of military action or meaningful sanctions, Russia can now resort to the
use of traditional hard power in consolidating and protecting its
position.

Both China and Russia have provided examples of how territorial gains
made through hybrid warfare and grey-zone tactics can be weaponised
further to serve wider national security aims and ambitions by
warranting the question of how to respond in an effective manner.

[Russian warfighting stratagems as **dangerous precedent**]{.underline}

The question arises of what is new in Russian warfare since 2008. Among
a host of features of the new war some are indeed noteworthy: the
non-declaration of war, the use of armed civilians, non-contact clashes
like the blockade of military installations by 'protestors', the use of
asymmetric and indirect methods, simultaneous battle on land, air, sea,
and in the informational space, and the management of troops in a
unified informational sphere.66

The authors have written extensively about hybrid warfare and its
Russian equivalent as reflexive control67 and nonlinear warfare. Russian
Hybrid Warfare has become known as the so-called 'Gerasimov'
doctrine68--- though while Western military authors (including us)
continue to use this reference, it is at least questionable if General
Gerasimov actually intended to have his thoughts and reflections on
evolving Russian military operational approaches be regarded as a
military 'doctrine' in a strict sense.69 So, while the existence of such
a doctrine is debatable, the overall success of contemporary Russian
warfighting is not, and the term hybrid warfare is a good
characterisation of Russia's contemporary aggressive foreign policy.

The actual **[consequences]{.underline}** [of Russia's hybrid warfare
are **far-reaching**]{.underline}. [Russia's foreign policy (and also
China's) of assertive **nationalist posturing**,
**meddling**]{.underline} [in internal affairs, **political
warfare**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} **[hybrid
warfare]{.underline}** [disrupt]{.underline} the Western narrative of
**[globalisation]{.underline}**, **[rule of law]{.underline}**,
**[democracy]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[interconnectivity]{.underline}**. This [creates an **untenable
situation**]{.underline} [where the West is responding to **ad hoc
threats**]{.underline} [in an **increasingly less assertive
way**]{.underline} [instead of **defining** and]{.underline}
**[implementing]{.underline}** [a]{.underline} joint [foreign policy
that would **deter** such an adversary]{.underline}.

[[Russia's]{.mark} version of [hybrid
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} whether we refer to it as
Gerasimov's doctrine, Russian Hybrid Warfare or reflective control,
[[has been **successful**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Firstly, Russia proved
successfully 'that this warfare not only includes nonstate actors but
also states']{.underline}.70 [Secondly, it proved the effectiveness of
this form of warfare because Russia's departure from its reliance on
kinetic resources]{.underline} also [[reduced]{.mark} the [need for
using **conventional military power**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in a
**conventional sense**]{.underline}, [which **benefits** the
'**weaker'**]{.underline} [opponent]{.underline}. And
[thirdly]{.underline}, [hybrid warfare as part of a **wider**
**information-operation**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[lawfare]{.underline}** [approach [provided]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[false legitimacy]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[due to]{.mark}
**attribution questions**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[potential for denial]{.mark}]{.underline}** by [the target state for
political reasons]{.underline}. [This [**Russian success**]{.mark} with
hybrid warfare [is]{.mark} [what China]{.mark} [seems to be
**emulating**]{.mark} in]{.underline} [respect to its current
territorial expansion: [the use **of 'little blue
men'**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[info]{.mark}rmation

**pressure** and]{.underline} **[lawfare]{.underline}**]{.mark} (which

U.S. Complacency, and How We Got There

Noted George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen and other
[[experts]{.mark} have [recognized]{.mark} a
[growing]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[complacency]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[in American life as the indicator of a **societal shift**]{.underline}
[from the United States' **early dynamism**]{.underline}. From the turn
of the twentieth century until roughly the moon landing of 1969, the
breakneck pace of groundbreaking technologies that directly affected the
quality of life and the structure of U.S. society was simply astounding.
Yet, [[since the]{.mark} first [moon landing]{.mark} in 1969, [**only**
the **internet**]{.mark} and its]{.underline}
**[application]{.underline}** to more and more parts of our lives [can
claim to have [made a]{.mark}ny **[meaningful
impact]{.mark}**]{.underline}[---]{.mark}meaning that physically the
world of 1969 is much more like that of 2021 than 1969 was of the early
twentieth century. This, of course, is not meant to discredit the great
advances in medicine and human genomics made in the last few decades,
for example, but to show how [the [**rate** of
**society-changing**]{.mark} [**innovations** has **not**
**maintained**]{.mark} the **[pace]{.mark}** that existed from the
**mid-nineteenth century**]{.underline} [until roughly
1969.]{.underline}

[In the developed world, [this slowdown]{.mark} has unfortunately
[contributed to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[wage
stagnation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the]{.underline}
[**[shrinking]{.mark}** of]{.underline} [[the **middle
class**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[greater political
[polarization]{.mark}]{.underline}** domestically. [**Coinciding** with
the **waning** days of the **Soviet Union's power** in the 1980s, the
U.S. **innovation decline** was **masked** at home.]{.underline}
Further, the Soviets of that period no longer posed a technological
threat to the United States. Japan on the other hand, posed a great
technological threat in the 1980s but was and is a staunch U.S. ally,
and not a security threat. Unchallenged abroad and riding the dual-edged
optimism of the internet boom of the 1990s and the victory over
communism, the United States missed the ways in which it was giving up
the advantages that made it such a powerhouse in the mid-twentieth
century.

**US manufacturing and high-tech innovation are both in deep decline.**

Flawed Policy Concepts Hinder the United States From Adopting the

THE CASE FOR ACTION

[Before describing the **chain of logic** that points directly to the
**need** for an **advanced-industry strategy**, it's important to lay
out the **case** for]{.underline} [some sort of action. In short: [Over
the **last two decades**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [the
**U.S.**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**economy** has **[lost its
competitiveness edge]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Perhaps [[the **most obvious sign**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of U.S.
economic decline [has been]{.mark} the [**erosion** of]{.mark} the
country's **[manufacturing]{.mark} base**]{.underline}. From 2001 to
2010, [the United States lost **42,400 factories**]{.underline}
(three-quarters of which employed at least 500 workers while in
operation), 32 percent of its manufacturing jobs, and much of its
technical edge.1

[Since then there has been **further erosion**]{.underline}. From 2007
to 2019, [while **GDP grew** by **22 percent**]{.underline}, **[real
manufacturing value-added]{.underline}** [grew by just **5.6
percent**]{.underline}. As [a result, [manufacturing's **share**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} gross domestic product ([**[GDP]{.underline}**)
**[fell]{.underline}**]{.mark} from 13.2 percent to 11.4 percent. [This
also **obscures** **significant differences**]{.underline} **[within
industry sectors]{.underline}**. [All of the eight nondurable goods
sectors]{.underline} (such as paper, chemicals, and plastics) [produced
**less** in **absolute terms**]{.underline} [in 2019 than they did in
2007]{.underline}. Moreover, as a number of analysts---including the
Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF)---have shown,
the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) significantly overstated the
output growth of the computer sector (NIACS 334) because it assumes that
when a computer doubles in speed due to Moore's Law, actual output also
doubles. Leaving out the production of computers---most of which has
moved overseas---U.S. manufacturing output actually declined by 3
percent.

[Just as troubling is that U.S. manufacturing is in a **productivity
slump**]{.underline}. [In 15 out of 18 years from 1990 to]{.underline}
[2007, **manufacturing productivity** grew]{.underline}
**[faster]{.underline}** [than overall non-farm business
productivity]{.underline}, often by more than twice as much. [But
between 2008 and 2019, manufacturing productivity grew faster in just
**3** of the]{.underline} [12 years]{.underline}. [In 2019]{.underline},
while business productivity grew 1.9 percent, [manufacturing
productivity grew just **0.1 percent.**]{.underline} One reason for this
might be U.S. manufacturers increased capital expenditures by just 17
percent between 2008 and 2017 (the latest year for which data is
available), or one-third the rate of the information sector (e.g.,
Internet, communications, etc.). [Without robust productivity growth,
manufacturing gets **less competitive globally**, which is why it grows
**more slowly than GDP.**]{.underline}

One would think, with manufacturing productivity growing more slowly
than the rest of the economy, job growth would be robust (and as other
sectors become relatively more efficient). But at the end of 2019,
manufacturing employment was still 6.5 percent below its pre-recession
levels.

But [even if [America is]{.mark} losing manufacturing, surely it is
still [leading in **innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[right?]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[So goes the thinking]{.underline}**
([as if manufacturing is not innovative]{.underline}). [[But on **many
measures**]{.mark}, [when **controlling**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for the
**size** of the **economy**]{.mark}---such as government and business
research and development (R&D) expenditures and patenting---[the United
States is **no longer the leader**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [It
ranks]{.underline}]{.mark} [**12th** in **patent cooperation treaty
patents**]{.underline} [filed as **share of GDP,** **23rd** in
**researchers per capita**]{.underline}, [**[27th]{.underline}** [in
**high-tech exports**]{.underline}]{.mark} [as share of trade,
and]{.underline} **[44th]{.underline}** [in **scientific and technical
articles**]{.underline} [as a share of GDP]{.underline}.2 Moreover, [in
2019, the United States [ran an **all-time-high trade deficit**]{.mark}
of \$132 billion [in **advanced tech**]{.mark}**nology
products**]{.underline}, down from a \$4.5 billion trade surplus in
2001.3 With China, the trade deficit in electronic products was \$184
billion in 2017, as U.S. exports totaled just \$21 billion.4

[Also, [many **once-iconic**]{.mark} U.S. [**advanced-industry
firms**]{.mark} have [**lost** **significant global market
share**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[or]{.mark} even **[gone out of
business]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Forbes issues a list of the **top
2,000 firms each year**]{.underline}. To be sure, [from 2006 to
2019,]{.underline} [a number of U.S. technology firms **increased**
their **global ranks** significantly, particularly in software
(e.g.,]{.underline} Microsoft); [semiconductors]{.underline} (e.g.,
Intel, Micron, and Nvidia); [and Internet services]{.underline} (e.g.,
Facebook). **[But]{.underline}** [many]{.underline}
**[hardware]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[related
firms]{.underline}** [either]{.underline} **[lost ground]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[went out of business]{.underline}**. **[Once-global
leaders]{.underline}** [such as **Lucent**, **Motorola**, and
**Nortel**]{.underline} (a Canadian firm that at one time employed
thousands of U.S. workers) [are now **defunct**]{.underline}. [And
leaders such as **IBM**, **Hewlett Packard**]{.underline},
**[Agilent]{.underline}** (formerly part of HP), [and **General
Electric** all **fell significantly**]{.underline}. (See table 1.)

THE CHINESE JUGGERNAUT

The [**[changes]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} American
[**[innovation]{.underline}** [would matter less if the
**world**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[had [remained
unipolar]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead, [they occurred **alongside the
rise of a geopolitical**]{.underline} [rival]{.underline}. Over the past
two decades, [[China]{.mark} has [evolved]{.mark} from a country that
largely]{.underline} **[steals and imitates]{.underline}** [technology
[to one that]{.mark} now also **improves and even [pioneers
it]{.mark}**[. This is **no accident**]{.mark}]{.underline}; it is the
result of the state's deliberate, long-term focus. China has invested
massively in R & D, with its share of global technology spending growing
from under five percent in 2000 to over 23 [percent]{.underline} in
2020. If current trends continue, China is expected to overtake the
United States in such spending by 2025.

Central to China's drive has been a strategy of "military-civil fusion,"
a coordinated effort to ensure cooperation between the private sector
and the defense industry. At the national, provincial, and local levels,
the state backs the efforts of military organizations, state-owned
enterprises, and private companies and entrepreneurs. Support might come
in the form of research grants, shared data, government-backed loans, or
training programs. It might even be as simple as the provision of land
or office space; the government is creating whole new cities dedicated
solely to innovation.

[[China's investment in **5G**]{.underline}]{.mark} technology
[[shows]{.mark} how [the **process**]{.mark} **works in
practice**]{.underline}. [Equipment for 5G makes up the **backbone of a
country's cellular network**]{.underline} [infrastructure]{.underline},
and the Chinese company [Huawei has emerged as a **world leader in
engineering**]{.underline} [and **selling it**]{.underline}---offering
high-quality products at a lower price than its Finnish and South Korean
competitors. The company has been buoyed by massive state support---by
The Wall Street Journal's count, some \$75 billion in tax breaks,
grants, loans, and discounts on land. Huawei has also benefited from
China's Belt and Road Initiative, which provides generous loans to
countries and Chinese companies to finance infrastructure construction.

Massive **[state [investments]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in **artificial
intelligence**]{.underline} [have]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[paid
off]{.mark}. Chinese researchers now publish more **scientific
papers**]{.underline} [in that field than **American** ones do. Part of
this success is the]{.underline} [**result of funding**, but something
else plays a big role: access to **enormous amounts of
data**]{.underline}. [[Beijing has fueled]{.mark} the rise of
**[powerhouse companies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that sweep up endless
information **about their users**. These include
**[Alibaba]{.mark}**]{.underline}, an e-commerce giant;
**[[Tencent]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which developed the all-purpose
WeChat app; **[[Baidu]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which began as a search
engine but now offers a range of online products;
**[[DJI]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which dominates the consumer drone
market; [[and **SenseTime**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which provides facial
recognition technology for China's video surveillance network and is
said to be the world's most valuable artificial intelligence company. As
a matter of law, these companies are required to cooperate with the
state for intelligence purposes, a broad mandate that is almost
certainly used to force companies to share data for many other reasons.

That information increasingly involves people living outside China.
Chinese companies have woven a global web of data-gathering apps that
collect foreigners' private information about their finances, their
search history, their location, and more. Those who make a mobile
payment through a Chinese app, for example, could have their personal
data routed through Shanghai and added to China's growing trove of
knowledge about foreign nationals. Such information no doubt makes it
easier for the Chinese government to track, say, an indebted Western
bureaucrat who could be convinced to spy for Beijing or a Tibetan
activist who has taken refuge abroad.

China's hunger for data extends to some of the most personal information
imaginable: our own DNA. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began,
**[BGI]{.underline}**---a Chinese genome-sequencing company that began
as a government-funded research group---[has broken ground
on]{.underline} some 50 **[new laboratories]{.underline}** [abroad
designed to help governments **test for the virus**]{.underline}. China
has legitimate reasons to build these labs, but it also has an ugly
record of forcibly collecting DNA data from Tibetans and Uighurs as part
of its efforts to monitor these minorities. Given that BGI runs China's
national library of genomics data, it is conceivable that through BGI
testing, foreigners' biological data might end up in that repository.

Indeed, China has shown great interest in biotechnology, even if it has
yet to catch up to the United States. Combined with massive computing
power and artificial intelligence, innovations in biotechnology could
help solve some of humanity's most vexing challenges, from disease and
famine to energy production and climate change. Researchers have
mastered the gene-editing tool CRISPR, allowing them to grow wheat that
resists disease, and have managed to encode video in the DNA of
bacteria, raising the possibility of a new, cost-effective method of
data storage. Specialists in synthetic biology have invented a new way
of producing nylon---with genetically engineered microorganisms instead
of petrochemicals. The economic implications of the coming biotechnology
revolution are staggering: the McKinsey Global Institute has estimated
the value of biotechnology's many potential applications at up to \$4
trillion over the next ten to 20 years.

Like all powerful technologies, however, biotechnology has a dark side.
It is not inconceivable, for example, that some malicious actor could
create a biological weapon that targeted a specific ethnic group. On
controversial questions---such as how much manipulation of the human
genome is acceptable---countries will accept different degrees of risk
in the name of progress and take different ethical positions. The
country that leads biotechnology's development will be the one that most
profoundly shapes the norms and standards around its use. And there is
reason to worry if that country is China. In 2018, the Chinese scientist
He Jiankui genetically engineered the DNA of twin babies, prompting an
international uproar. Beijing portrayed him as a rogue researcher and
punished him. Yet the Chinese government's disdain for human rights,
coupled with its quest for technological supremacy, suggests that it
could embrace a lax, even dangerous approach to bioethics.

THINKING BIGGER

[**[Washington]{.underline}** [has monitored
China's]{.underline}]{.mark} [technological [progress through **a
military lens**]{.mark}, worrying about how it contributes to Chinese
**defense capabilities**]{.underline}. But [[the **challenge is much
broader**. China's push for]{.mark} [**technological supremacy** is
not]{.mark} simply [aimed at]{.mark} **gaining [a battlefield]{.mark}
advantage**; [Beijing is changing the **battlefield
itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although commercial technologies such as
5G, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and biotechnology will
undoubtedly have military applications, [[China envisions]{.mark} a
world of **great-power** competition in which **[no shots]{.mark}** need
to be fired. [Technological supremacy **promises**]{.mark} **the
[ability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to **dominate** the **civilian

[Operational planning]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[capabilities
development]{.underline}**

A report by the defence committee of the UK parliament finds that [NATO
is **poorly prepared**]{.underline} [to respond to the Russia's use of
asymmetric warfare]{.underline}, [including cyber attacks,]{.underline}
[information and psychological operations.]{.underline} The
[committee]{.underline} [urges the Alliance to develop its own
asymmetrical]{.underline} [warfare capabilities]{.underline}, discuss
how to deal with these attacks and operations, and mount its own
offensive operations.58 . It [also calls NATO to **re-examine** the
**legal** and]{.underline} **[military]{.underline}**
**[doctrines]{.underline}**, **[criteria]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[responses]{.underline}** [for the declaration and
use of]{.underline} both Article 4 and **[Article 5.]{.underline}**59
Likewise, James Stavridis, retired NATO\'s Supreme Allied Commander
(SACEUR) believes NATO should stand up a cyber defence operations force
under the SACEUR, as well as explore the utility of offensive cyber
weapons.60 The need to integrate cyber into NATO's military operations
and operational planning has been acknowledged also by Jamie Shea.61
**[[Operational planning]{.underline}]{.mark}** [both [for **Article
5**]{.mark} [and **non-Article 5 events**]{.mark} **[along
with]{.mark}** **[capability development]{.mark}** [must be]{.mark}
[adjusted]{.mark} to the reality of asymmetrical or hybrid
warfare]{.underline} that employs a range of tools, including
information operations and cyber attacks.

In addition to the need to integrate cyber into both military and civil
emergency operational planning, NATO must improve the interoperability
of cyber capabilities of the Allies and this process can be facilitated
by the means that will be provided by the newly established NATO's cyber
range.

Furthermore, [[realistic]{.mark} **[cyber]{.mark} threat
[scenarios]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [[as well as]{.mark}
**[clear]{.mark}** and tested **[response
procedures]{.mark}**]{.underline} and **[mechanisms]{.underline}**
[[should be in place]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Operational [**contingency
plans** must **clarify**]{.mark} **[which
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [NATO [nations are **prepared** to
**make available**]{.mark} **to the Alliance**]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} the [**mechanisms** for **collective**]{.mark}
**[assistance]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by the individual
Allies]{.underline}. A full range of response options (including kinetic
means) accompanied by appropriate plans and capabilities need to be
worked out. Since a simultaneous strike against NATO's own and the
member state's infrastructure is likely, it would be prudent to ensure
enough common capabilities to respond to both tasks. The existing two
small RRTS consisting of a permanent core of six experts may be
inadequate for simultaneous tasks.

[[In order to **enable**]{.mark} **military [operational
planning]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[NATO should consider]{.mark} the
development of **[cyber warfare doctrine]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It
should establish a joint cyber command or headquarters (not unlike the
Special Operations Headquarters), aligning joint strategy with political
ends, at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). Concerns
about the legality of an offensive action in cyberspace aside, while
NATO does not have an offensive cyber capability, member states'
capabilities could be used under Article 5 circumstances. [NATO needs to
ponder]{.underline} also [what could be done to **help an
Ally**]{.underline} [experiencing a cyber attack]{.underline} causing
serious damage to its private critical infrastructure.

**Setting a framework for cyber defense is also key to [tech
innovation]{.underline}**

Setting the stage

[[Cyber-security is yet to be]{.mark} **globally**]{.underline},
[**[legally]{.underline}**, **[operationally]{.underline}**]{.mark},
[and]{.underline} **[strategically]{.underline}**
**[[defined]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The scale of a security perspective
is more attractive at this time considering the geostrategic challenges
and threats. [The [possibility of **innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[entrepreneurship]{.underline}** [in the field
[is]{.mark} also a **[tangible]{.mark} reality**,]{.underline} [due to
the necessary research and development methods]{.underline}. More so,
the possibility of an open market economy sharing of knowledge and
technological skills makes security and cyber-security or defense for
that matter more attractive. [What **[lacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in
the world wide [**legal** and **political**]{.mark} **[framework of
operations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[exchange of
info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}** and protectiveness from new sources
or methods that can be deemed as elements of infiltration.

The article's aim is to examine and recommend a global strategic
framework for operational capacity and management resilience between
allied and cooperative partners in the field of cyber-security. The
current article is a follow up of prior scientific publications made in
2014 first and later in 2018, on NATO's cyber-security strategy,
presented through a framework of Cyber-Development, Cyber-Democracy, and
Cyber-Defense (Carayannis, Campbell & Efthymiopoulos, 2014; Carayannis,
Campbell & Efthymiopoulos, 2018). The aim is to converge diversified
information on cyber-security, in a single strategic framework; reflect
to the actual practical needs in understanding operations and tactical
ability to deliver in multi-complex and dimensional world through
management and operational efficiency capabilities. The article requests
interoperability of aims and objectives under a global framework of
cyber-security; through a strategic framework on cyber-security, global
law can be proposed, defined, and adopted by the international
community. The [**[strategic framework]{.underline}** [will define
**structures**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that are [needed]{.mark} to be put
in place]{.underline} on a global scale, [when reflecting issues of
cyber-security]{.underline} and inclusive [[for
**NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It will define threats and challenges, as
cyber-attacks are real. [Cyber-security is not an
asymmetrical]{.underline} or hybrid [threat, but an **existential
one.**]{.underline} Its destructive capacity can be multi-leveled and
can also lead to human casualties. The future of e-safety lays at both a
global estimation framework of what constitutes cyber-security and how
we react to it; it lays in between cooperation of allies and members of
wider alliances, against specified or approximate threats. [Yet, its
**framework** of aims and objectives, **management**, command and
control, and operations will be defined and decided by **allied
parties**]{.underline} only [such as]{.underline} is the case of
[**NATO**.]{.underline}

**[[Operationally]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[national]{.underline}]{.mark} and cooperative [[forces]{.mark} [need
to be]{.mark} **continuously [agile]{.mark}** [and **technologically
advanced**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In an asymmetrical world, which is
complete with unforeseen challenges and threats, we need forces with
**flexibility**]{.underline}, **[adaptability]{.underline}**,
[operational and strategic command structure,]{.underline} based on high
technologically sophisticated information "coming in," but also being
used while in training or through active operations.

On a theoretical scale, the current [article requests a cyber-security
**strategic framework**]{.underline} [adoption of
**resilient**]{.underline} **[adaptability]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[interoperability policy]{.underline}** in the
framework of safety and defense. The article considers that
[understanding the realities of threats is]{.underline} by definition [a
natural innovation and as we move ahead,]{.underline} we structure and
operate a single strategy on cyber-security against a virtual threat
from wherever it comes from. [Its long-term [resilience may be]{.mark}
more **[complex]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[as **operational
capacity**]{.mark} [needs to]{.mark} constantly **develop** and
**[adapt]{.mark}**]{.underline} into the convergence of societal
structures, and methods; where socio-economic, technological, defense
even health, and education issues are affected.

[When theory on cyber-security, resilience, and operational capacity
will be applied at NATOs level, it will **enable allies** and members,
jointly, to create a **true policy** and]{.underline}
**[strategy]{.underline}** [for cyber-security resilience]{.underline}
[against **hybrid virtual threats**]{.underline}. The methodology on how
to is presented through this current article.

The article's design is based on cross-disciplinary and
interdisciplinary approaches. It combines elements of global security
and strategy, national and international law, economic development, and
technological research and advancement and most importantly is
innovative and entrepreneurial; its understanding will enable us to
comprehend global and regional market establishment and convergence, as
also economic changes. The setting of the study required lapse of time
to showcase the need and the necessity of the subject. Current output
reflects a set of written analyses, rules, and primary experiences. It
methodologically acquired sources of information of related necessity
and relevance, shaped the understanding, and need to point out for a
framework of rules, regulations, management, and operations on
cyber-security.

The article and its author frames a specific policy recommendation with
regards to the creation of not only a regional alliance (NATO-based
scale), Cyber-Security Strategy for the twenty-first century but a
global one. The article defines the "dynamism" of cyber-security both as
a topic and subject. Cyber-security is a twenty-first century element of
policy orientation; a necessity for both collective and individual
defense and security resilience.

In specific, [a [**cyber-security strategy** for NATO will **enhance its
innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[creativity]{.underline}** core of operations and methodologies
[against any kind of virtual threats. It [will set
**standards**]{.mark}, **policy procedures**]{.underline}, and
recommendations. [NATO's strategy of cyber-security]{.underline} through

**[Smart defense]{.underline}** and more so in [the field of
cyber-security is NATOs main priority policy.]{.underline} It does
however reflect as well on to the tools and mechanisms used to innovated
in and for management operations, processes, and tactics. It allows for
defense entrepreneurial thinking and application. [**Constant changes in
strategy** and]{.underline} **[policy]{.underline}** do [request
**efficient leadership**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[management]{.underline}** skills to operate. [And so, should NATO's
cyber-resilience **strategic policy**]{.underline}.

Through a methodological period, such as in the NATO Summit in Brussels
of July 2018, NATO will now have to show an enhanced progress report
within the second quarter of 2019, assuring current and future abilities
also in cyber-security, to counter current and emerging challenges in
cyber-space. **[Defense planning,]{.underline}**
**[operations]{.underline}**, and lessons learned [are]{.underline}
therefore [a continued process that allows the **evolution of NATOs
capabilities**]{.underline} [which always need to be taken into
account]{.underline} and more so in the field of cyber-security where
the Cyberspace Operations Center will play a key role into it.

**[[Resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}** [through smart and cooperative
innovative defense **[requires]{.mark}** [NATOs
**policy**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[on Cyber-defense to]{.mark}
[be]{.mark} also **[effective]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As said, [it
[requires **decision-making**]{.mark} [and
**leadership**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in this policy context. [In]{.mark}
the framework of [cyber-defense, NATO needs]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[NATO]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[processes.]{.underline}** [[In]{.mark}
the framework of [cyber-resilience]{.mark} at NATO, [policies]{.mark} on
standing management of operations [need to be agreed
upon]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Therefore,
**[[cooperative]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} **[consensus
leveled [agreements]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[need to come
forth]{.mark};]{.underline} NATO should produce a cost-effective
projection planning and application for all operational exercise
theaters reflecting the real yet also virtual worlds.

[Cyber-resilience]{.underline} and methodological specialization through
leaders' policy decisions at the level of Heads of States and
Governments in operational planning and practically applied [are key
components of and for success for the Alliance, considering]{.underline}
[threat assessments. Resilience with coordinated efforts may lower
costs, fiscal, administrative, and human, but will **require**
**developed technology infrastructure**]{.underline}. It will guarantee
national engagement of states to NATO policies, when correctly pointed
out. Let us not forget that **[specialization]{.underline}** as a key
national policy is and will always remain a form of **[national
interests]{.underline}**, which examined changing variables based on
geographical interests, strategic sharing of costs, technological
information, and intelligence sharing or operating in regional or global
environments.
