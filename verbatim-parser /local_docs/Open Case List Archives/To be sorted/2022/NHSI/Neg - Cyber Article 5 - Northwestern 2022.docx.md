both the Allies and [the Alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Compared to the air, land and sea domains, the cyber domain is not
constrained by national borders (although certain physical aspects of it
might be located within them). This distinction between the cyber and
the geographic domains is important to note, because NATO was founded in
response to external military threats without the right to intervene in
internal security matters, where member states maintain the monopoly
over the use of force. In the cyber domain, the distinction between
internal and external security threats is harder to ascertain. When
integrating offensive cyber capabilities into its defence and deterrence
mandate, NATO would inevitably tackle certain aspects inherent to
internal security; and yet, not legally infringe on the sovereignty of
the Allies as long as effects amounting to force or intervention are not
employed against the physical systems residing in these nations.6
[[Operating]{.mark} in the cyber domain [requires]{.mark}]{.underline},
thus, [that [member states **better integrate**]{.mark} their
**[offensive cyber]{.mark}** capabilities into NATO operations not just
to win future wars, but also [to **avoid**]{.mark} elements of

**unilateral**]{.mark} cyber **[effects]{.mark}** to defend critical

NATO's adversaries in the cyber domain

[Warfare in the cyber domain is already conducted against NATO member
states by both state and nonstate actors. It is also conducted by NATO
member states against these external threats. [Within the
Alliance]{.mark}, however, [offensive cyber]{.mark} effects are [**not

**[integration]{.mark}** of national offensive cyber capabilities [into

capabilities into NATO operations, thus **[requires]{.mark}**, not only
a clear understanding of these capabilities, but also [**agreement** on

[against US energy infrastructure in 2017 (including against a nuclear

and critical infrastructure of NATO member states for
years.]{.underline} For this reason, the US Secretary of Defense, Mark
T. Esper, remarked at the 2020 Munich Security Conference that [the 5G

multiple attacks against the critical infrastructure of NATO partner

Getting More Aggressive on Offensive Cyber\", Defense One,
https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/05/nato-getting-more-aggressive-offensive-cyber/157270/

[In the latest signal [**NATO** is adopting a **tougher posture**
against cyber]{.mark} and electronic [attacks]{.mark},]{.underline}
Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg]{.underline} this week
[said]{.underline} that [the defensive alliance will not remain purely
defensive]{.underline}.

Stoltenberg told attendees at the Cyber Defence Pledge conference in
London, ["**[We are not limited]{.mark}** to respond in cyberspace when
we are attacked in cyberspace."]{.underline}

[NATO [members]{.mark} have [**already "agreed** to integrate]{.mark}
national cyber capabilities or **[o]{.mark}**ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
into Alliance **[o]{.mark}**peration**[s]{.mark}** and
missions,"]{.underline} he said. [But the **[parameters]{.mark}** of a
NATO response to cyber attacks [remains
**undefined**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2015, Stoltenberg said that [a
cyber [attack against one]{.mark} member nation [could trigger]{.mark}
an Article 5 collective [response by all]{.mark} members]{.underline}.
Yet only once has a collective response ever been invoked, at the
request of the United States following the attacks of September 11,
2001. [NATO is a defensive organization, so what an offensive cyber
posture looks like remains something of a mystery. An Article 5 response
can take many different forms.]{.underline}

[That's the strength of the article]{.underline}, according to NATO
Deputy General Secretary Rose Gottemoeller. [However]{.underline}, while
[an Article 5 response]{.underline} can be unpredictable, it [must be
coordinated, which can be tricky with many different partners in
possession of many different capabilities]{.underline}.

At an event in May, Gottemoeller said [[NATO]{.mark} was in the
processes of establishing a new innovation board [to "**bring together
all**]{.mark} of the **[parts]{.mark}** of and pieces of NATO that have
to wrestle with these new technologies to really try to get a flow of
information]{.underline}. Many of you having served in any international
institution or government, you know how things can get stove-piped. So
[we are [resolved to **break down**]{.mark}]{.underline} those
**[[stove-pipes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly where innovation is
concerned," she said.

[[NATO]{.mark} is building a **[cyber command]{.mark}** that is
scheduled to be fully [operational in **2023**]{.mark} and [will
coordinate]{.mark} and conduct [all **o**]{.mark}ffensive
**[c]{.mark}**yber **[o]{.mark}**peration[**s**.]{.mark} **[Until then,
whatever NATO does offensively]{.mark}**, it [will **rely**]{.mark}
heavily [on]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates and the
**[discretion]{.mark}** of U.S. commanders]{.underline}, according to
Sophie Arts, program coordinator for security and defense at the German
Marshall Fund, who explains in this December report.

"Yesterday's remarks indicate that [NATO's [leadership is
**thinking**]{.mark} more [**seriously** about]{.mark} buttressing the
alliance's deterrence posture in **[cyber]{.mark}**space and address
**[threats]{.mark}** that fall [under]{.mark} the threshold of an
**[Article 5]{.mark}** violation]{.underline}," she told Defense One.

["This tracks recent shifts in strategy adopted by several NATO allies,
including the United States, which integrate offensive cyber operations
as an important tool [to proactively address]{.mark} growing instances
of cyber [interference]{.mark} from hostile actors."]{.underline}

**[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** Arts points out [[there is **no**]{.mark}
field [**manual** for coordinating]{.mark} cyber offensive
**[op]{.mark}**eration[**s** among]{.mark} individual
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, including big players in cyber like
Estonia, the U.K. and the United States, who keep command and control
over their assets.

In 2017, Gregory Edwards, then director of infrastructure services at
NATO's communication and information agency laid out what that might
look like. "You could make a case-by-case decision" about responding to
attacks, he said. ["[You **need**]{.mark} to have [**a policy** that
says, '**if our operation is disturbed, we will take**]{.mark} a
specific **[action]{.mark}**.' The action will be listed. It will be
listed what things the commander is allowed to do in that regard. It
will be a specific action."]{.underline}

[NATO Cyber Rapid Reaction teams are already equipped to conduct

Speaking at the Cyber Defence Pledge Conference in London in May 2019,
NATO Secretary General highlighted that [[for **deterrence** to have
**full effect**]{.mark} against state and non-state adversaries,
[NATO]{.mark} and its member states [must be ready to use the **full
range of capabilities**]{.mark} at their disposal, [to include]{.mark}
national **[offensive cyber]{.mark}** capabilities]{.underline}.
Deterrence is the act of diminishing an adversary's intent by
highlighting the excessive costs for the said adversary if it proceeds
with an undesired action. [In NATO's case, deterrence is achieved by
highlighting to an adversary the excessive costs delivered through
military means in the event of an attack against Allies. For deterrence
to be successful, [the adversary **must believe**]{.mark} that [NATO is
**ready and willing** to impose]{.mark} these [**excessive costs across
all operational domains**, to include]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} domain.
[This may call for Allies to **develop offensive cyber**]{.mark}
capabilities and integrate them with NATO operations in order [to
**collectively impose** a **high**]{.mark} enough [**cost** to **deter
adversaries** from **aggressive behaviour**]{.mark}. To avoid escalation
to total war and cyber fratricide during the fog of war, Allies must
also agree on a list of Flexible Deterrent Options]{.underline} meant to
allow for a gradual increase of pressure in the cyber domain, and then
hopefully limiting the scope and intensity of conflict in this domain.
[NATO Flexible Deterrent Options in the cyber domain could
include]{.underline} (as presented in Figure 1):

Peter **Ramjug 22**, Journalist at Northeastern University, \"Russia
Hasn't Launched a Massive Cyberattack on Ukraine Yet. Why Not?,"
Northeastern University, 3/7/22,
<https://news.northeastern.edu/2022/03/07/ukraine-russia-cyberattack/>

More than a week into war and [Russia]{.underline} **[has
yet]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [**unleash a paralyzing, large-scale
computer network attack on Ukraine**. U.S. banks are
**bracing**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} retaliatory
**[cyberstrikes]{.underline}** [that have]{.underline} **[yet to
materialize]{.underline}**. Even Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine's
president, continues to post videos.

[What]{.underline} has **[happened]{.underline}** [to
Moscow's]{.underline} much-heralded [cyber-warfare]{.underline}
capabilities**[?]{.underline}**

For starters, "[they're]{.underline} **[not as
sophisticated]{.underline}** [as]{.underline} many [people make them out
to be]{.underline}," says Northeastern's David Wesley, who teaches
graduate-level courses in global strategy and culture in the
D'Amore-McKim School of Business. "[It's actually the
**West**]{.underline} that is [crippling the **Russian**]{.underline}
computer [systems]{.underline}."

[Microsoft, in]{.underline} the span of [just]{.underline} a few
**[hours]{.underline}**, detected and **[thwarted]{.underline}**
[a]{.underline} **[data-wiping attack]{.underline}** on Ukraine's
network days after the war started. [American enterprise rushing to the
rescue in times of war was reminiscent of how]{.underline}
**[Ford]{.underline}** quickly [pivoted]{.underline} its assembly lines
[during]{.underline} **[World War II]{.underline}** to build tanks,
jeeps, and airplanes.

[Russia may also be]{.underline} **[reluctant]{.underline}** [to start a
cyberwar for fear of]{.underline} **[getting attacked
back]{.underline}**, adds Luis Dau, associate professor of international
business and strategy.

"They don't want a war on two fronts if they don't have to," he says.
"[They're finding the war on Ukraine]{.underline} **[harder than they
were expecting]{.underline}**."

**[Western]{.underline}** [governments and companies---and the Ukrainian
government itself---have]{.underline} **[beefed up their]{.underline}**
computer **[defenses]{.underline}** since 2017, when a sinister
ransomware program known as NotPetya infiltrated the servers of Maersk,
the Danish cargo-shipping giant. The program destroyed servers and
computers around the globe.

Had it not been for a lone company server in the African nation of Ghana
that lost power and thus wasn't connected to the rest of the network,
the situation could have been much worse. "That's what saved Maersk but
it was by accident," says Wesley.

"Instead of \$300 million, it would have been billions of dollars in
damage," he adds.

Two years later, in August 2019, Ukrainian officials launched the new
Ministry of Digital Transformation, which is working on
cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and offensive hacking capabilities.

"We are creating an IT army," the ministry's 31-year-old leader tweeted
over the weekend. It directed cyber devotees to a Telegram
channel---"itarmyofurraine"---that instructed followers on how to
disable Russian websites. Russia's largest stock exchange as well as a
government-owned bank and the Russian Foreign Ministry were taken
offline after being targeted by Ukrainian hackers.

Ukrainian ministry officials have also been working with the Anonymous
hacking collective to take down Russian sites.

"If you go to almost any Russian website, they're offline," says
Northeastern's Wesley. "So [the threat against]{.underline}
**[Russia]{.underline}** [of cyberattacks is]{.underline} **[much
higher]{.underline}** now [than]{.underline} it is [against
us]{.underline}." But, he warns, "that doesn't mean the threat isn't
there. It's still really serious."

Periodic web outages have been reported in Ukraine since hostilities
began, but nothing approaching the size and devastation of the Maersk
attack, one of the worst cyber breaches ever. Maersk employees
reportedly noticed "Ooops your files are encrypted" messages appearing
on their laptops before screens systematically went black one-by-one
company-wide.

Wesley, Dau, and Alexandra Roth, an executive professor of international
business and strategy at Northeastern, authored a case study to be used
in international strategy courses to teach students about responding to
global threats such as cyber warfare and regional disputes.

The June 2017 Maersk incident was likely collateral damage from an
attack on Ukraine, which "has long been a testing ground for Russia's
cyber capabilities, and it was no coincidence it all started on the
Ukrainian Independence Day," Roth says.

**[Most]{.underline}** computer [network attacks]{.underline}, they say,
[have the]{.underline} **[greatest]{.underline}** [impact
on]{.underline} **[antiquated operating systems]{.underline}** such as
the one Maersk was using. At a minimum, companies should have a broad
approach that includes regular upgrades and patches.

Ignoring those steps could be costly.

[**Maersk** executives]{.underline} were focused on issues such as
inflation, trade, and fluctuating energy prices, but
"**[failed]{.underline}** [to recognize that a cyberattack
posed]{.underline} a far greater **[threat]{.underline}** on its
critical infrastructure," the professors wrote in the case study.

[The]{.underline} U.S. **[banking system]{.underline}** **[wouldn't make
the same mistake]{.underline}**.

[It has been guarding its networks for **years**]{.underline}, investing
massive sums on technology and people to build a wall around its most
important data.

Even with those precautions, big institutions such as JP Morgan,
Citigroup, and Bank of America have seen a wave of recent cyberattacks
that they describe as a subtle but intensified assault, the New York
Post reported. The attacks have ramped up since the U.S. imposed
sanctions against Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.

But it's not the big banks that have to worry about a Russian-fueled
security breach, say Northeastern professors. It's the smaller regional
banks, credit unions, and hospitals.

"It's an existential crisis for these smaller organizations," Wesley
says. "The larger ones are much better protected."

Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire founder of Tesla and
SpaceX, has been outspoken about the invasion of Ukraine. He has come to
Ukraine's defense by shipping Starlink satellite internet stations to
keep communications lines open.

Musk warned that Russian forces could still target the terminals.

"Starlink is the only non-Russian communications system still working in
some parts of Ukraine," Musk tweeted, "so probability of being targeted
is high. Please use with caution."

That goes back to the Northeastern professors' beliefs that the combined
efforts of Western technology makes Russia no match for the West.

"[Our capabilities are **much stronger than many**]{.underline} people
**[believe]{.underline}**," says Wesley.

[The **big question**]{.underline} [now surrounding a digital
attack]{.underline} on Ukraine [revolves around **NATO's Article
5**]{.underline}, which is [based on a collective defense mindset if one
country is targeted]{.underline}, says Roth.

"So [if a critical infrastructure gets hurt and if it causes physical
damage similar to a conventional kinetic attack, then **this is pretty
clear that NATO will step in,**]{.underline}" she says, something that
may make Moscow think twice. [Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but
several of its **neighbors** are.]{.underline}

MR. CARLIN: And I don't want to underestimate that it's important to
have [[a **declaratory** policy]{.underline}.]{.mark} But I would firmly
agree with Jim. [[**We had one**. We declared it]{.mark}. We've declared
it now [**multiple times** in the context of **specific actions**, and
then **not acted**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [that has]{.underline} a --
[[the **inverse**]{.mark} effect [of **encouraging future

MR. LEWIS: No, I think you need to split it into two parts. And so
[[on]{.mark} the **[resilience]{.mark}** side]{.underline}, I'm a little
gloomier, in that I don't -- [[**ten years** is]{.mark} probably an
**[optimistic]{.mark}** estimate]{.underline}. So I do think -- so I
used to make fun of **[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and I still
do at some levels, but I think you [[have to convince]{.mark} potential
[attackers]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and we have four -- [that the
[risk]{.mark} of doing something to U.S. critical infrastructure [is
outweighed by]{.mark} the [cost]{.mark}]{.underline}. And that's part of
what we're talking about today, is how do we identify costs that could
apply to people?

On the social media side, I think there's this question of what does
intermediation look like? What does the ability to impose new standards
on the new media look like? And, you know, some people have said, well,
Facebook needs to go out and hire 3,000 editors. They probably don't
need to do that, but how do we encourage people to begin to identify the
false information. That's probably something you can do with technology.
But how do we do it in a way that's respectful of freedom of speech? And
so it's a very intentionally complicated issue, because no U.S.
government agency has the authority to go and say: This is -- this is
fake news. This is false. So it's something that we'll have to either
change the laws or find incentives for the companies.

MR. LEDGETT: I do think that there's a role for the government in terms
of helping identify the provenance of a story and helping to identify --
you know, the first time this story appeared was in this place, to our
knowledge. And so that's input to a process that I agree the government
can't run. But I think that -- and, John, you would be the expert on
this. But I think that, you know, they could add a paragraph to the
39-paragraph end user license agreement that nobody reads that says:
Hey, we are going to exercise our judgement and we're going to flag, you
know, things that we believe are suspicious or don't look factual. And
you agree to let us do that.

MR. LEWIS: How would you break -- how would you avoid a tit for tat
cycle? What would you do to -- this is not going to be a one-move game,
right? So we've experienced things. I think we all agree we should do
something back. And I'm fairly confident that other side will not say,
OK, we give up. So we are going to get into an iterative process here.
How do we control that? And I don't know if escalation dominance is the
right way to think about it. That's a nice nod to Herman Kahn. But what
is it we do to get out of the cycle of just tit for tat? And you've seen
this in -- certainly in some of the terrorist cases, certainly in the
Israeli experience. It doesn't do you any good to get into response -- a
counter-response cycle.

MR. MILLER: I agree with that. And [it's true within
cyberspace]{.underline}. It's because, as was noted earlier, we are more
vulnerable than Russia in cyberspace. That does not necessarily need to
be the case forever. I do think [[10 years is]{.mark} probably on the
[optimistic]{.mark} side [for **hardening**, **but**]{.mark} it's
**[not]{.mark}** the optimistic side for **[increasing]{.mark}** our
**[offensive capability]{.mark}**, which is]{.underline} -- which is,
I'll say, [non-trivial]{.underline}, even today. One of the challenges
we need to just have in the foremost of our mind as we think about
U.S.-Russia tit for tat is that the high end of the escalation ladder is
thermonuclear war, right? And so taking steps to show that we have
limited aims, even though we're responding strongly, keeping open
channels of communication, taking note of fire breaks.

[NATO adversaries in the cyber domain also include non-state actors,
such as terrorist organizations. The US]{.underline} and the UK have
[conducted several successful **[o]{.mark}**ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
**[o]{.mark}**peration**[s]{.mark}** against those entities. These
offensive cyber operations had [a]{.mark} significant **[force
multiplier]{.mark}** effect, in conjunction with conventional
actions]{.underline} on the ground, at sea, in the air and from space,
[[that contributed to]{.mark} the **[defeat of Daesh]{.mark}** in both
Iraq and Syria]{.underline}.10 Today, [most Allies are building
[offensive cyber]{.mark} capabilities [needed to **deny**]{.mark}
adversaries the **[freedom of maneuver]{.mark}** in the cyber
domain.]{.underline}

The use of area denial weapon systems in the cyber domain

Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) weapon systems have traditionally been
used by NATO and its member states to prevent an adversary's freedom of
maneuver on land, sea or air. In the geographic domains, these
capabilities include land mines, missiles (cruise, ballistic, surface to
air, anti-ship, etc.), submarines, electronic warfare, and even
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE)
weapons. [In the **[cyber]{.mark}** domain [**A2/AD** is achieved
through]{.mark} **[o]{.mark}**ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
**[o]{.mark}**peration**[s]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Those operations have already been used]{.underline} for the purpose of
achieving A2/AD by NATO member states in the cyber domain. This is the
case of [the US-led Operation Glowing Symphony (OGS), where "the United
States Cyber Command reportedly acquired administrator passwords to
\[Daesh\] websites. The passwords enabled **[deletion of digital
content]{.mark}**, including videos used for recruitment]{.underline},
from cyber infrastructure located in at least five countries outside
actively hostile areas of Iraq and Syria. Similar digital content
reportedly resided on cyber infrastructure in as many as 30 other
States. [**[Changing]{.mark}** the **[passwords]{.mark}** reportedly
locked IS administrators out of the websites".]{.underline}11 [OGS
restricted Daesh's freedom of maneuver on networks physically residing
in Iraq and Syria (which were controlled by the terrorist group), but
also worldwide, where a NATO member state (the US) achieved
**[d]{.mark}**enial **[o]{.mark}**f **[s]{.mark}**ervice effects against
Daesh.]{.underline}

[OGS [disrupted]{.mark} Daesh **[propaganda]{.mark}** through content
removal from servers residing in multiple countries and through
restricting access to physical [**infrastructure** needed to store
digital data]{.mark}. Combined with operational successes against ISIL
on the ground, OGS actions resulted in propaganda efforts being
significantly reduced]{.underline} on several global social media
platforms, including Twitter. [One particular offensive cyber operation
acted, ipso facto, as [an A2/AD platform]{.mark} where a NATO member
state [restricted access to]{.mark} physical [networks **critical** for
Daesh **recruitment**, **training**, **radicalization**,
**fundraising**, and **c**]{.mark}ommand **[and]{.mark}**

[[NATO's]{.mark} publicly declared [policy on cyber]{.mark} threats [is
**consciously**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and **[purposefully
vague]{.mark}**]{.underline}.207 [Why?]{.underline} [**[Strategic
ambiguity]{.underline}** [has]{.underline}]{.mark} [its
**[benefits]{.mark}**]{.underline}. According to the Atlantic Council
panel, [[there is no **"redline"**]{.mark} or **"determined threshold"**
that would **automatically define**]{.underline} [a cyber act as an act
of war]{.underline}.208 [[Leaving]{.mark} the [rules
**undefined**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[affords]{.mark} NATO **ample
[room]{.mark}** in which [to operate]{.mark}]{.underline}. For a
28-member multinational organization that operates on the principle of
consensus, **[time]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[latitude]{.underline}** [for **solidifying strategic-level
decisions**]{.underline} [are **critical**]{.underline}. [[If NATO
**publicized** a **cyber redline**]{.underline},
[it]{.underline}]{.mark} [would **[box]{.mark}** the Alliance [into a
**corner**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This]{.underline}]{.mark} [kind of
policy could **[embolden]{.mark} cyber [offenders]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and **provoke**]{.mark} **massive [intrusions]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[that **target**]{.mark} **NATO's [networks]{.mark}** at **[just
below]{.mark}** this threshold]{.underline}. [Having [a defined
redline]{.mark} could also [invite **nefarious**]{.mark} **cyber
[actors]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to **cross it**]{.underline} [to

**[resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[damage]{.underline}**]{.mark}

security]{.underline}, [[and **undermine**]{.mark} the
**[cred]{.mark}ibility**]{.underline} [of its Article 5
commitments]{.underline}.

Following the Wales Summit in 2014, NATO affirmed its stance on law and
cyberspace while refusing to address cyber redlines:

> Our policy also recognizes that international law, including
> international humanitarian law and the UN Charter, applies in
> cyberspace. [Cyber attacks can reach a threshold that threatens

> [security]{.underline}, [and stability]{.underline}. [Their impact
> could be as **harmful** to **modern societies**]{.underline} [as a

**The plan's redline cause adversary probing that escalates\-\--Russia
and other actors will target [just below]{.underline} the threshold,
[knowing]{.underline} that it [definitely]{.underline} won't cause
Article 5 activation AND they'll [cross it]{.underline} to
[test]{.underline} resolve\-\--that's Ghavam**

**Ambiguity [deters]{.underline} aggression by introducing
[uncertainty]{.underline} into adversary's calculus\-\--clarity causes
[provocations]{.underline} that go [nuclear]{.underline}**

Cyber Threat", The National Interest, 7/2/2010,

That seems reasonable enough and is certainly a matter that deserves
discussion within [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, I have it on good
authority, it's in fact being discussed frequently. But, while it makes
sense for the allies to draw up contingency plans and reinforce their
cooperation and capabilities in this burgeoning arena, we [[should
**stop short** of **formally declaring** what]{.mark} **precise set of
[circumstances]{.mark}** would [allow Article 5]{.mark} to be
invoked]{.underline}.

[First, doing so would **put the members in a bind**. A cyber attack
might technically meet the theoretical definition put forth in advance
without the actual circumstances generating consensus for any number of
reasons]{.underline}. Perhaps the aggrieved party will be perceived to
have provoked the attack by belligerence---belligerence that would
actually be encouraged by an a priori declaration of support.

Or perhaps the risks of retaliation simply outweigh the damage done by
the attack because of complicating circumstances. This is hardly
unthinkable given that the most probable nation-state aggressors are
Russia and China.

Regardless, [the allies would then be forced to choose between the
credibility of NATO and their own short-term interests]{.underline}.
It's an untenable position far more likely to harm the alliance and its
members than to ward off the cyber threat.

Second, [[there's **tremendous value** in **strategic
ambiguity**]{.mark}. This was commonly understood during the Cold
War]{.underline}, when the United States refused to declare that it
would not engage in first use of nuclear weapons. [While our leaders
almost certainly had no intention of launching a first strike, they knew
that **[declaring]{.mark} this [formally]{.mark}** would [make]{.mark} a
[**conventional attack**---which]{.mark} could be expected to
[**escalate** to]{.mark} a **[nuclear war]{.mark}**---**more
[likely]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In the cyber case, [drawing [a **bright line**]{.mark} for potential
adversaries virtually **[invites actions just short]{.mark}** of casus
belli. [By instead]{.mark} simply declaring that there may be
circumstances in which NATO will consider a cyber attack on one of its
members an attack on all---but **[not spelling out]{.mark}** what those
[circumstances]{.mark} may be---those contemplating such an
[attack]{.mark} will [have]{.mark} an **[additional risk]{.mark}
factor** [to **deter**]{.mark} them]{.underline}.

[The **N**]{.underline}orth **[A]{.underline}**tlantic
**[C]{.underline}**ouncil [should simply come to an understanding that
the charter's]{.underline} 1947 [language]{.underline} requiring an
"armed attack" to invoke collective defense [is dated and that
[**flexibility** is needed]{.mark} for emerging threats. Plus, they
should agree to **increase cooperation** in this arena and
**streamline** the process by which **consultation** under Article 4 can
take place]{.underline}.

**It [also]{.underline} causes future
[overreaction]{.underline}\-\--NATO will be [forced]{.underline} into
[conflict]{.underline} when adversaries go beyond**

Finally, [[NATO needs to **maintain ambiguity** on]{.mark} what
justifies an [Article 5 response]{.mark}]{.underline}. As mentioned
previously, [[ambiguity]{.mark} has **[served]{.mark} NATO
[well]{.mark}**[. A **set threshold** for when]{.mark} NATO [will
invoke]{.mark} an Article 5 response [to]{.mark} a [cyber]{.mark}-attack
on a member country [is **not necessary**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
ambiguity has historically served the alliance well, as demonstrated by
the 9/11 attacks. If the alliance had said weapons were only include
guns, bullets, tanks, and bombs, it would have set a threshold
precluding a NATO response to attacks that turned four planes into
improvised missiles. The larger issue of ambiguity is that there is no
set definition of what constitutes an armed attack and what
circumstances dictate a collective response, as per Article 5.
[[Remaining ambiguous]{.mark} on the severity threshold of a
cyber-attack [allows]{.mark} the [alliance to act]{.mark} in cases of
future cyber-attacks that cause severe damage, [but also]{.mark} allow
NATO [to **refrain from over-reacting**, **even if**]{.mark} an [event
is]{.mark} a **[cyber]{.mark}**, or kinetic, attack [**as per a
definition**. It would be a **mistake** to set a threshold for attacks
that **cannot**]{.mark} **currently [be
anticipated]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**The plan accelerates Russian [cyber
probing]{.underline}\-\--adversaries will [test redlines]{.underline}
and [circumvent]{.underline} escalation thresholds**

[**[NATO]{.underline}** [needs to be careful about
**defining**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and **signaling its
[redlines]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Making]{.underline}]{.mark} [these
boundaries **[too specific]{.mark}**]{.underline} [could]{.underline}
[**[embolden adversaries]{.underline}** [to
intensify]{.underline}]{.mark} [their [actions below]{.mark} NATO's
declared **[threshold]{.mark} of response**]{.underline}.
[[Being]{.underline} **[deliberately ambiguous]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[and [raising]{.mark} the **[fear of retribution]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[may be]{.underline} **[more useful]{.underline}** [for
[encouraging adversaries']{.mark}]{.underline}
self-**[[restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

At the same time, [NATO should aim to deter specific types of
particularly threatening unconventional activities]{.underline}. These
include major and sophisticated cyber attacks against allies' military
forces and critical military and civilian infrastructure, proxy military
and special forces operations, and state-sponsored terrorism. NATO could
declare that such activities may lead it to invoke Article 5 and respond
in various ways, including asymmetrically (for example, the response to
a cyber attack may not involve only cyber capabilities).

The alliance must be able to identify early whether and when
unconventional and hybrid gray-zone actions have become a more
substantial and coordinated campaign. In such a case, NATO should aim to
deter the adversary from escalating further. This requires increasing
the alliance's capacity to share early-warning intelligence and pool
national intelligence-gathering, investigation, and attribution
capabilities. NATO should not shy away from attributing ongoing
operations to state adversaries, relying on national data as needed. The
alliance and its members should be prepared to use direct channels of
communication and other means to deliver immediate deterrence signaling
in specific cases.

[On the Southern flank, [**NATO** faces]{.mark} state]{.underline}
[actors that use [unconventional **tactics**]{.mark} and]{.underline}
**[proxy forces]{.underline}** (for example, Iran and Syria); [state
collapse and the emergence of ungoverned spaces in
**Libya**]{.underline}, **[Yemen]{.underline}**, [and parts of the
Sahel]{.underline}; and the activities of a range of nonstate actors,
[from loose groups to **terrorist** and criminal networks]{.underline}
to highly organized quasi-state structures like Hezbollah.
**[[Coop]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration [with regional partners in
addressing these threats [will be **vital**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark} [primary]{.underline}
[[task]{.underline}]{.mark}, as elsewhere, [[should be to
**deter**]{.mark} **states** in the region from]{.underline} [using
**[unconventional tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against **NATO** and
its allies]{.underline}, [[using **signaling**]{.mark} and
**attribution** tools]{.underline}. When possible, the alliance should
aim to affect the calculus of nonstate actors to prevent them from
harming alliance interests. This may not work with jihadist groups but
may be possible with actors motivated by political or economic
interests.

**[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [making deterrence a]{.underline}
]{.mark}**[top [priority]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Baltic Region.
[Not only does [Moscow wish to extend its]{.mark} **[s]{.mark}phere
[o]{.mark}f [i]{.mark}nfluence**]{.underline} to include what it
describes as 'near abroad', [it must carefully protect its own model of
'**sovereign democracy'**]{.underline} at home. Prior to Russian
involvement, Ukraine was getting close to signing an association
agreement with the European Union (EU) and it was feared that
'democratic change in brotherly Ukraine could spread to Russia'.
[Transforming Ukraine to a western democracy was seen as a
**threat**]{.underline} [to the Russian regime and was thus stymied at
its source]{.underline} (Snegovaya, 2014). However, the Baltic States
have already been fully integrated into NATO and the (EU) and have been
stable democracies for over two decades now. So what is the nature of
the threat that Russia presents to the Baltic States?

[Putin is using **[hybrid tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as a means of
achieving his objectives of a **politically [restructure]{.mark}d
[Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These include]{.underline} massive
[pro-Russian **[propaganda]{.mark}**]{.underline} and misinformation
campaigns, using **[economic levers]{.underline}**,
[**[intimidation]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
employment of **[cyber]{.mark} war**]{.underline}f[are]{.underline}
elements. [In Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014, [Russia]{.underline} has
once again [demonstrated its resolve to use both military and
non-military means]{.underline} to create and fuel conflicts in pursuit
of its wider geopolitical interests. The Kremlin is busily trying to
regain its sphere of influence over nations that were formerly part of
the Soviet Union, and the Baltic States' governments are continuously
being reminded to stay alert. In addition, **[NATO frontier
allies]{.underline}** [face much more **significant
threats**]{.underline} [due to their proximity to the potential
**aggressor**]{.underline} (Grygiel and Mitchell, 2016, p. 166). [Thus,
what **[NATO needs]{.mark} most** to deter Russia is ['to
demonstrate]{.mark} **robust political [solidarity]{.mark}**[']{.mark}
within the alliance]{.underline} (NATO Parliamentary Assembly Report,
2015, pp. 4-6). [There has been a significant]{.underline}
**[increase]{.underline}** [in Russian **[probing]{.mark}** activities
to [gauge]{.mark} NATO's **[commitment]{.mark}** to the Baltic States
over the past two years]{.underline}. Grygiel and Mitchell (2016, p. 43)
define Russian probing as a 'lowmintensity and low-risk test aimed at
gauging the opposing state´s power and will to maintain security and
influence over a region'. In case of the Baltic States, [probing is
aimed at the]{.underline} **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and the
strongest European countries, their power and their [will to back
up]{.mark} their most **exposed [allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As
mentioned by Grygiel and Mitchell (2016, p. 122), '[there is a strong
correlation between the **existence** of **alliances** in a given region
and the **effectiveness of deterrence**]{.underline} against a
threatening power'. [Building on the **allies' fear of abandonment** and
**US fear of entrapment** in local **conflicts**, [Russia is aiming to
**hinder**]{.mark} **their [relations]{.mark}hips** [which]{.mark} could
ultimately [provide Moscow]{.mark} with more [room for

To see this, just work backward from the present. During the Cold War, a
bipolar balance did help avert actual war between Moscow and Washington.
But even in Europe---where the spheres of influence were best
defined---there were continual tensions and crises as Moscow tested the
Western bloc. And outside Europe, violence and proxy wars were common as
the superpowers competed to extend their reach into the Third World. In
the 1930s, the [emergence of **[German]{.mark}** and [**Japanese**

lasted a mere 14 months. And looking back to the ancient world, there
were not one, but [**three** **Punic Wars** fought between Rome and
Carthage as two expanding empires came into conflict. A world defined by
**[s]{.mark}**pheres **[o]{.mark}**f **[i]{.mark}**nfluence [is]{.mark}
often a world [**characterized** by **tensions**, **wars**, and
competition]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The reasons for this are simple. As the political scientist William
Wohlforth observed, unipolar systems---such as the U.S.-dominated
post--Cold War order---are anchored by a hegemonic power that can act
decisively to maintain the peace. In a unipolar system, Wohlforth
writes, there are few incentives for revisionist powers to incur the
"focused enmity" of the leading state. Truly multipolar systems, by
contrast, have often been volatile. When the major powers are more
evenly matched, there is a greater temptation to aggression by those who
seek to change the existing order of things. And seek to change things
they undoubtedly will.

The idea that spheres of influence are stabilizing holds only if one
assumes that the major powers are motivated only by insecurity and that
concessions to the revisionists will therefore lead to peace. Churchill
described this as the idea that if one "feeds the crocodile enough, the
crocodile will eat him last."

Unfortunately, today's rising or resurgent powers are also
motivated---as is America---by honor, ambition, and the timeless desire
to make their international habitats reflect their own interests and
ideals. It is a risky gamble indeed, then, to think that **[[ceding
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** or **[China]{.underline}** an uncontested
sphere of influence [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} turn a revisionist
authoritarian regime into a satisfied power. The result, as Robert Kagan
has noted, might be to **[[embolden]{.underline}]{.mark}** those actors
all the more, by [giving them **freer rein** to bring]{.underline} their
[**near-abroads under control**, **greater latitude** and **resources**
to **[pursue]{.mark}**]{.underline} their [**[ambitions]{.mark}**, and
**[enhanced confidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[the
**U.S**]{.mark}**.-led [order is fracturing]{.mark}** at its
**foundations**. For **China**, dominance over the **first island
chain** might simply **intensify** desires to achieve **primacy** in the
**second**]{.underline} island chain and beyond; [for **Russia**,
**renewed mastery** in the **former Soviet space** could lead to desires
to [bring]{.mark} parts of the former [Warsaw Pact to heel]{.mark}, as
well.]{.underline} To observe how China is developing ever longer-range
anti-access/area denial capabilities, or how Russia has been projecting
military power ever farther afield, is to see this process in action.

The **[[reemergence]{.underline}]{.mark}** of a spheres-of-influence
world [would]{.underline} thus **[[undercut]{.underline}]{.mark}** one
of the great historical achievements of U.S. foreign policy: the
creation of a system in which America is the dominant power in each
major geopolitical region and can act decisively to shape events and
protect its interests. [It would foster an environment in which
**[democratic values]{.mark}** are **less prominent**, **authoritarian**
models are **ascendant**, and mercantilism advances as **economic
[openness recedes]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And rather than leading to
multipolar stability, this change could simply [[encourage]{.mark}
**greater [revisionism]{.mark}** on the part of powers whose **appetite
grows** with]{.underline} the **[eating]{.underline}**. This would lead
the world away from the relative stability of the post--Cold War era and
back into the darker environment it seemed to have relegated to history
a quarter-century ago. The phrase "spheres of influence" may sound
vaguely theoretical and benign, but its real-world effects are likely to
be tangible and pernicious.

Fortunately, the [return of a **s**pheres-**o**f-**i**nfluence **world**
is not yet inevitable]{.underline}. Even as some nations will accept
incorporation into a Chinese or Russian sphere of influence as the price
of avoiding conflict, or maintaining access to critical markets and
resources, others will resist because they see their own well-being as
dependent on the preservation of the world order that Washington has
long worked to create. The Philippines and Cambodia seem increasingly to
fall into the former group; Poland and Japan, among many others, make up
the latter. The [**[willingness]{.mark}** of even this **latter group**
[to]{.mark} take actions that [risk]{.mark} **incurring
[Beijing]{.mark}** [and **Moscow's wrath**]{.mark}]{.underline},
however, [[will be]{.mark} **constantly [calibrated]{.mark}**
[against]{.mark} an [**assessment** of **America's**]{.mark} own
[**ability** to]{.mark} **continue [lead]{.mark}**]{.underline}ing [the
**resistance** to a **s**pheres-**o**f-**i**nfluence
**world**.]{.underline} Averting that outcome is becoming steadily
harder, as the relative power and ambition of America's authoritarian
rivals rise and U.S. leadership seems to falter.

\*\* IRA == l'Internet Research Agency de Saint Petersburg

Questioned in march 2018 during his confirmation hearing at the senate
about the reprisals that adversaries of the United States can fear after
attacks, cyber or informational, [general [Nakasone]{.mark} clearly put
forward that adversaries do not fear eventual reprisal]{.underline} (the
deterrent effort would be insufficient or ineffective). [To overcome
this]{.underline}, [he [officially applies a concept inherited from the
American special forces "**forward defense**]{.mark}]{.underline}," put
in the open in the war on terror, and [[that consists in carrying
out]{.mark} preventative [actions]{.mark} in being [**permanently
present** in foreign computer systems]{.mark}.]{.underline} It should be
clear that **[one must be prepared for offense]{.underline}** [to make
defense]{.underline} of national territory [effective]{.underline}.

Today, [the Cyber Command endowed with new prerogatives by the
Executive]{.underline} (in National Memorandum 13, still confidential)
and by Congress [would carry out **preventative cyber operations**
targeted on strategic foreign sites]{.underline} (Russian, in priority).
These would not be the subject to the prior approval of the white house,
which allows an augmented speed of response. [[The objective of
these]{.underline}]{.mark} (disconnecting the IRA, carrying out an
intrusion into the Russian GRU), made responsible for DNCleaks, carry
out threatening targeted messaging campaigns against officials or
foreign military) [[would be to **dissuade all states** considered
threatening to]{.mark} democracy and [America]{.mark}n national
security]{.underline}. For some people observers, [it would be a
question of [practicing a \"cyber cold war\" by **using
everything**]{.mark} the [available]{.mark} cyber and informational
\"deterrence\" arsenal.]{.underline}

And this, all the more so as with the proliferation of hybrid conflicts
in Europe such as in Asia, many middle powers allied with the United
States are under attack cyber, Russian or Chinese, which target their
defense infrastructures. These attacks often support other forms of
threats, operating in the \"gray zone\". This is the case since 2012,
for the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam or Taiwan, which with conflicts
over maritime borders facing China, suffer provocations Chinese in their
territorial waters, doubled by cyber attacks on their civil and military
infrastructures facing which they found themselves destitute. These
vulnerabilities led them to seek help from the American partner to be
able to train their own cyber units10 . For the United States[, the
affirmation of [an offensive cyber posture may be seen by]{.mark} its
[allies as an]{.mark} attempt to **[maintain a comparative
advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the cyber space as its status as
hegemon is put in question.

Thus, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} American [[intrusion carried out
against Russian electricity]{.mark} infrastructure]{.underline}s in June
2019 [[was]{.mark} publicly presented as a way [to **prevent a
blackout**]{.mark}]{.underline} (massive power cuts) **[[in]{.mark} some
[pivotal American states]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [during
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [campaign [presidential election]{.mark} of
2020]{.underline}.11 For those responsible for US cyber offensive
operations, [[the challenge now is to digitally infiltrate]{.mark}
[hostile systems even **before they can attack**]{.mark} national
territory[. The objective is also to make believe in a **balance of
power**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to **increase
deterrence**]{.underline}]{.mark} [as in the days of the
nuclear]{.underline} age. For as much, the [idea is to avoid for all
actors any damage reaching targets civilians]{.underline} (such as
hospitals) to avoid escalation.

**[alliance]{.mark}** and **[coordination]{.mark}**. It is [all
about]{.mark} specialization of forces including the element of
**[resilience]{.mark}** of forces mainly [through
**tech**]{.mark}nological **[agility]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Smart defense is prioritized as a method of innovative approach.
Reflective toward efficiency and efficacy. Needs to meet NATO forces

[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} the following steps: [(1) sound strategic

Resilience as methodology: NATO's strategic aim

[**Resilience** is a method]{.underline}. A dedication to the goal. It
is therefore an aim. Terminologically is announced in security-led
strategies yet also business-led strategies. It holds a completely sound
operational aim. To deliver and stick to the requested. [It is brand
name that defines strategy through which it results to operational
capacity that sustains and grows; [at]{.mark} the level of
[NATO]{.mark}, with the capacity to apply in diverse fields of
operations adding value, to [an **already robust** **policy
decision**]{.mark} and operational **[capacity]{.mark}** building and
actions; at the level [of **cyber-security policy resilience**]{.mark}
to the framework [is a "strong-hold" policy to deliver]{.mark} a
**[protection]{.mark}** mechanism and method.]{.underline}

[Resilience's framework acknowledges the will for **preparedness** so as
to counter]{.underline} a possible integrative part of possible
[emerging crises]{.underline}. It is seen as [an innovative strategic
management policy procedure and tool.]{.underline} Strategically, it
applies to operational capacity building, both civil and military. It is
an element of acknowledged standardization of procedures. [In the
defense sector, when forces are deployed, they need **flexible** and
effective means of countering threats; while in the field of
cyber-security, they need **agility** in operational network centric
**op**eration**s**, and constant accurate flow of
**info**rmation.]{.underline}

[Strategic resilience in cyber-security requires flexible adaptability
to new challenges]{.underline}. [Its **strategic resilience** works as a
tool for closeness, mitigation, and/or **negotiation**; it
[allows]{.mark} for **[coop]{.mark}**eration [among]{.mark} allies or
[members]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[NATO's vigilance and resilience in security-led affairs including
cyber-security [defines]{.mark} strategic **[plans]{.mark}** and
re-assesses **risks** that will [allow us to think **entrepreneurial**
and **innovative**]{.mark}. For NATO members]{.underline}, Heads of
State, and Governments, [cyber-security creates a modern administrative
and operational format and framework of the alliance at a virtual level
that is flexible and e-oriented, [reflective to]{.mark} the **[market
needs]{.mark}** for security and stability, while [augmenting]{.mark}
market **[e-innovation]{.mark}** and while [adapting]{.mark} to [**new
affordable methods**]{.mark} of **economic** and socio-economic
**growth**. NATO acquires protection mechanisms [while]{.mark} its
**[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** and memberships
**[enlarge]{.mark}** while operational [challenges are]{.mark} upgraded
and **[updated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. NATO needs to provide militarily
and technologically agile and interoperable forces with added value,
through civilian capabilities (NATO's Cyber-Defense Policy, 2011).

[Resilience in security-led affairs through innovation and
entrepreneurship therefore should be [a **leveled adaptation
process**]{.mark} for NATO; a phase to consequently strategize and draw
new scenarios for cyber-security]{.underline} among others. [This comes
through operational result processes of **training** and
**experiences**, when countered in an effective manner [with
**lessons**]{.mark} to be [**learned**]{.mark} constantly [in
**adaptable** new circumstances]{.mark} against any forms of
cyber-attacks.]{.underline}

[Resilience becomes thus a policy orientation for NATO's **["Smart
Defense"]{.mark}** clause.]{.underline} [NATO
[boosts]{.mark}]{.underline} on **[[military
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [methods of operational
support]{.underline} and deliverables [and protection mechanisms, while
remaining relevant as a political military organization]{.underline}, a
regional and global asset value to security and strategy application at
a time of vast changes and challenges.

**The plan undermines our tech edge**

Investment, Matthew Gillis, Defence Investment Staff Officer at NATO HQ,

Secondly, [the pace of change has accelerated at a tempo that risks
outpacing our ability to exploit and, as necessary, counter the
technological advancements on the horizon. Many of these technologies
are driving towards **[faster]{.mark}** and [more **distributed**
decision-making]{.mark}, which in turn [bumps up against]{.mark} the
sometimes [**bureaucratic** and **conservative**]{.mark} nature of
[NATO]{.mark}'s machinery and [**decision making**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**Posturing the Alliance to fully embrace these tech**]{.mark}nologies
**[will require]{.mark}** an adapted mindset and culture of delegating
authority and **[accepting ambiguity.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

One case for improvement is in the area of NATO processes, particularly
those that manage procurements, standardization, and capability life
cycles. [We often strive for perfection in our future requirements, and
engineer our processes around [**numerous decision gates** and
**complicated management structures**]{.mark}. The [result is]{.mark} a
[capability]{.mark} that can be [**over budget**, **late**, and
**obsolete** when delivered. NATO has taken]{.mark} some [healthy
steps]{.mark} in this direction [with]{.mark} the adoption of [a **new
model**]{.mark} for governing common funded capabilities [with fewer
decisions]{.mark} and streamlined oversight. [But **continued efforts
are needed.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Industry also has a substantial role to play in this area. [Our]{.mark}
traditional **[d]{.mark}**efence **[i]{.mark}**ndustrial
**[b]{.mark}**ase [should not be]{.mark} complacent with a business
model that can be slow, cumbersome, and **[risk
averse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In what Klaus Schwab has defined as the
"fourth Industrial Revolution", [the changes on the horizon "herald the
transformation of entire systems of production, management, and
governance"]{.underline}1 [while entirely upending existing industrial
value chains. **The [success of Allies' industries will depend on more
acceptance of risk]{.mark}**, greater investment in research and
development, and an adapted mindset towards partnering with players
outside the traditional defence sphere.]{.underline}

[The **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates has entered an era of
long-term [**competition**]{.mark} with **revisionist powers**. A key
aspect of this competition [will revolve around]{.mark} a contest for
**[tech]{.mark}**nological **[superiority]{.mark}** waged
[between]{.mark} the national **innovation bases** of the respective
competitors. [The outcome]{.mark} of this competition [will
determine]{.mark} not just American national security but also how the
nations of the world interact---and [whether a **free and open**]{.mark}
political and economic [**system** will remain]{.mark} the foundation of
those interactions.]{.underline}

After a long post-Cold War focus on rogue regional powers and nearly two
decades of continuous warfare in the Middle East and a focus on rogue
regional powers, [the United States now faces a new defining national
security challenge: a long-term strategic competition with a resurgent
[**Russia** and]{.mark} a rising **[China]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Russia [seeks to reestablish]{.mark} itself as a **[global
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While Russia is able to compete with the
United States militarily in certain domains, its economic outlook and
long-term demographic prospects are grim. Accordingly, it is unlikely to
develop and nurture a true national innovation ecosystem. Given these
disadvantages, [Russia is limited to acting as a **geostrategic
spoiler** seeking [to]{.mark} undermine and [weaken the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates, its **[alliances]{.mark}**, and
its global interests.]{.underline}

China, on the other hand, is already challenging the United States
economically, militarily, and politically. China's economy has surpassed
that of the United States in terms of purchasing power parity and could,
under some scenarios, pass the U.S. GDP in absolute terms in the mid- to
late 2020s. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, China
defines its vital national interests in ways that are irreconcilable
with both the interests of the United States and the values of
self-determination and individual freedom to which we and our allies are
committed. [[China's]{.mark} global expansion, from both a trade and
military perspective, is [challenging the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [in]{.mark} virtually **[every region of the
world.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[In pursuit of its goal of reshaping the world order, China aims to
supplant the **U**nited **S**tates as the world's **leading
tech**nological **power** by 2030. China has articulated a distinct
strategy of statedriven innovation, defined by its concept of
"military--civil fusion," to lead the world in cutting-edge technologies
that might allow it to leapfrog the United States both economically and
militarily.]{.underline}

That strategy presents a two-fold challenge for the United States.
Economically, the challenge is to sustain American prosperity and access
to markets on equal terms with other nations against China's ambition to
control the economic sectors that will determine national primacy in the
decades ahead.

[Militarily, [the]{.mark} fundamental [mission]{.mark} of the U.S.
government (USG) [is to **deter a great-power war** and, if deterrence
fails, to **prevent escalation**]{.mark} of the conflict and end the war
on terms favorable to the United States and its allies. [An important
**key**]{.mark} to this mission [is]{.mark} achieving and maintaining
**[military--tech]{.mark}**nical [**superiority**.]{.mark}
However,]{.underline} over the last several decades,
[China---and]{.underline}, to a lesser extent, [Russia---has invested
heavily in advanced military capabilities specifically aimed at
overcoming the technological lead of America's armed
forces.]{.underline}

[As a result, [the **conventional overmatch**]{.mark} that [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has relied upon]{.mark} to **undergird**
its **deterrence** posture since the end of the Cold War [is
**eroding**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The balance of power in East Asia has
already shifted substantially in China's direction. [[If this]{.mark}
trend [continues]{.mark}, effective [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} in
that region [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[fail, leaving the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [to face]{.mark} the unattractive
alternatives of accepting aggression against its interests or its allies
or triggering **[armed conflict]{.mark}** with the]{.underline} People's
Liberation Army [(PLA), with all the attendant risks of
escalation.]{.underline}

The point of departure for any contemporary analysis of the means and
ends of innovation for national security should be the 2018 National
Defense Strategy (NDS).1 The strategy describes [a complex and dynamic
security environment marked primarily by a renewal of rivalry
[among]{.mark} the **[major powers]{.mark}**]{.underline} and with it
new forms of strategic competition and new forms of strategic conflict.
Among the dynamic elements it highlights is [the technological
dimension: **[strategic competition]{.mark}** with Russia and China [is
characterized by a]{.mark} seemingly [**relentless drive** to
develop]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**new tech**]{.mark}nologies---
[**advanced computing**, **big data**]{.mark} analytics,
**[a]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence, [**autonomy**,
**directed energy**, **hypersonics**,]{.mark} and
**[biotech]{.mark}**nology. **[Multiple simultaneous
tech]{.mark}**nological [**revolutions**]{.mark} are likely to
significantly [impact the **character of war**. The competitor that
**best harnesses**]{.mark} these **[tech]{.mark}**nologies [will have
the **advantage** in]{.mark} fighting and **[winning the wars of the
future]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The NDS exhorts the nation to [foster a
competitive mindset]{.underline} and emphasizes the need [to "out-think,
out-maneuver, out-partner, and out-innovate" our competitors and
potential adversaries.]{.underline}

It is not surprising that the NDS focuses on
**[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** as [a [**key** to **out-competing
adversaries**]{.mark} during a period of rapid technological
change.]{.underline} At the same time, the NDS hints that technological
innovation is a necessary, but not sufficient condition, for
outinnovating the competition. [[As tech]{.mark}nology
[advances]{.mark}, the nation's [military must]{.mark} also seek to
[innovate its **operational concepts**]{.mark} and
**[doctrine]{.mark}**, as well as its
**[organizations]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Each is explored below.

[A seismic shift is under way. Against the backdrop of rising

extinction, technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics
are now moving to transform the global order]{.underline}. Indeed, for

and Dinwiddie suggest that [this kind of economy is the next stage in
human evolution.]{.underline} But what do they mean?

1\. What is The Venus Project?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: The Venus Project is a non-profit organization
that presents a new socio-economic model utilizing science and
technology. For the past 40 years, we have maintained a 21-acre research
center in Venus, Florida. We propose [a new scientific
foundation]{.underline} in [[transcending humanity's]{.mark} current
[problems]{.mark} by]{.underline} testing a new social design for
[organizing our society as a global "operating system".]{.underline}

Taken as a whole, the Venus Project fills the egregious gap between the
sciences and the humanities by combining a social philosophy of the
future [with technical knowledge applied at a global scale to solve the
problems of the human condition]{.underline}. Our methodologies are
designed [to realize the full potential of science and technology to
achieve social betterment for all living systems]{.underline}--- without
exception. Our approach to social organization calls for changes in
governance, economics, urban planning, education, human relationships,
language, and values.

2\. We appear to be in the early stages of a massive economic
depression. What is your sense of what is happening politically and
economically right now?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: We are witnessing an unprecedented political
polarization and economic disruption around the world today. The status
quo is no longer working. [Many people are now beginning to understand
how dysfunctional the management of nations, peoples, and resources has
been. Human needs and the needs of our environment are far too complex
to be managed by political means, arbitrary economic direction, or an
elite without the relevant understanding of science and
technology.]{.underline}

Compounding this problem, [nature operates as a closed-loop system, but
we do not. We extract [resources]{.mark} without replenishing them,
accumulate [waste]{.mark} materials without recycling them, and we
pollute our [air, water]{.mark}, and [food]{.mark} crops for the need to
maintain competitive profit margins. There are [many]{.mark} other
[factors converging]{.mark} at once besides the pandemic, all of which
[contribute to]{.mark} the system's [unrest]{.mark}.]{.underline}

3\. Younger generations seem disaffected with Capitalism. Could you
describe your vision of a post-scarcity society?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: The Venus Project recognizes that if we utilize
[a global systems approach as a basis for organizing and managing
resources]{.underline}, we can design a much more humane environment for
all. Our goal is to advance the health and the protection of the
ecosystem, as opposed to the accumulation of wealth, property, and
power. We do not have enough money to fulfill the needs of the world's
people, but we do have enough resources, if wisely managed. Ultimately,
it is not money that people need, but unencumbered access to the
necessities of life and self actualization.

[Accomplishing this is a technical and engineering challenge [requiring
massive coordination]{.mark} by transdisciplinary teams of engineers and
scientists in [managing]{.mark} the Earth's [resources within]{.mark}
its [carrying capacity]{.mark}. This kind of scientific endeavor [would
eliminate]{.mark} the vicious [rivalries over]{.mark} scarce
[resources]{.mark} and, in turn, generate very different behavior
amongst people.]{.underline}

Briefly, this is what Jacque Fresco, founder of The Venus Project,
termed a "Resource Based Economy". [This is a necessary step for
humanity's evolution. It could be thought of as a new science, a science
of Earth Management where, by necessity, all of Earth's resources become
the common heritage of all the world's people.]{.underline}

4\. How does the Venus Project differ from Socialism or Communism?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: Rather than worker revolts and the forcible
overthrow of the system (Communism), or the redistribution of capital
(Socialism), The Venus Project approaches social change as a process of
guided evolution. In our view, [the challenges before us are a matter of
engineering and design]{.underline}. The Venus Project calls for an
experimental analysis of a new social system. This system is unlike any
communist revolution, utopian commune, or coup d'état tried in the past.

In our view, [[the fundamental issue]{.mark} limiting social management
in the past [has been]{.mark} the [lack of]{.mark} an effective
[data-driven methodology for]{.mark} evaluating and [improving the
system]{.mark}'s functioning.]{.underline} Full-scale blanket
application of social policies to vast geographic areas--- be it through
revolution or legislation--- without a means for evaluating their
effectiveness, follows from an approach heavy in ideology but short in
scientific method. The Venus Project calls for iterative prototyping of
cities that we take as the unit of analysis in validating or falsifying
hypotheses. All of this begins with testing a prototype, not a
revolution.

Although Karl Marx did envision a society wherein money, private
property, and social hierarchy were abolished, he could not begin to
imagine how to implement this system at a technical level. In contrast
to Communism, The Venus Project calls for [the total redesign of cities
(transportation, distribution, manufacturing, recycling, infrastructure)
to produce abundance of goods and services.]{.underline} This is
[achieved through automation and optimized infrastructural
efficiency.]{.underline}

5\. What role does technology and automation play in The Venus Project?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: [For the first time in history, we have the tools
and technology to guide and shape our evolution]{.underline}. To
accomplish this, The Venus Project advocates the humane and intelligent
use of technology and the methods of science directed toward the
well-being of all people and the environment which sustains all life.

In our view, technology and automation should be strictly used for
social betterment and to eliminate repetitive, dangerous and monotonous
work. If automation displaces a job, for example, that means all people
would gain more access to the products those machines produce. The
necessities of life are distributed without a fee with the aim of
expanding to all goods and services. Consequently, there is no threat
resulting from technological labor displacement. On the contrary,
[technology and automation have the potential for enhancing the world's
standard of living]{.underline}, enabling people to learn, spend time
with their families, travel, [and confront the new frontier of
challenges in improving the resilience of the system as a
whole.]{.underline}

6\. How do you envision utilizing AI in decision-making?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: [Applying the methods of science and technology
(including AI) to the operation of the world's societies will lead to a
substantially more reliable functioning of support systems than we have
today. Homelessness, [starvation, war, and environment]{.mark}al
degradation [are consequences of]{.mark} today's political and economic
approaches to [decision-making]{.mark}. A [R]{.mark}esource
[B]{.mark}ased [E]{.mark}conomy operates within a unified systems
approach that utilizes the methods of science and AI to arrive at the
most appropriate decisions at any given time]{.underline}. Unlike
today's implementation of technology, this new approach would be
carefully carried out with the utmost human and environmental concern.
[The real-time influx of quantitative and qualitative data [would
provide real-time feedback, enabling humanity to]{.mark} constantly
observe and [continually improve]{.mark} the operation of the system
over time.]{.underline}

7\. What are the future goals of The Venus Project?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: At present, we are focused on formalizing and
systematizing the body of work of The Venus Project's founder, Jacque
Fresco. In an age that is sorely lacking an approach updated to current
knowledge and capability, we enter uncharted territory with the methods
of science to help us through. This is the crucial job that no one has
attempted, until now.

In the short term, we are focused on a systems approach to organize a
holistic understanding of the natural world and human culture. This
involves understanding economics and human social systems in the broader
contexts of Earth processes and ecosystems, and communicating this
understanding through books, videos, the internet, podcasts, transmedia
storytelling, and course curricula.

In the mid-term, we aim to fulfill the [desperate need for]{.underline}
the [strategic coordination of consilience by synthesizing the knowledge
of academia and the know-how of industry. [This network of intelligence
will produce a]{.mark} transdisciplinary research agenda, research
program, and [global theory of change]{.mark}]{.underline}. Constructing
a new planning center will function as a living lab and think tank
devoted to designing the first prototype city.

In the long term, The Venus Project hopes to see the construction of new
prototype cities for the purpose of testing the hypothesis of [a
holistic, technical design-solution for a social system.]{.underline}
Iterations of these prototypes [will form a worldwide network of
cities]{.underline}. The study of these cities will function as [the
basis for a science of Earth management, the models of which guide the
intelligent allocation of resources for the purpose of optimizing
civilization to adapt and evolve in relationship with an Earth
ecology.]{.underline}

There is a lot to consider and we welcome participation in the
development of such a system.

[Future adaption: what are the most likely evolutions of the Alliance
looking forward?]{.underline}

[The **complexity** of NATO's future **adaptation** challenge must not
be under-estimated. The [**modernisation** of Russia]{.mark}'s armed
forces [is part of]{.mark} a new form of complex [**strategic coercion**
that employs **systematic pressure** across **5Ds**]{.mark} of
disinformation, destabilisation, disruption, deception and implied
destruction. Moscow's enduring aim is to use the implicit threat of
force [to keep]{.mark} the Western [allies **permanently**]{.mark}
strategically, politically and militarily **[off-balance]{.mark}** and
the threat of overwhelming force [as a form of]{.mark} strategic
**[extortion]{.mark}** racket focused on those at the margins of the
Alliance.]{.underline} As a consequence, future adaptation and the
Alliance concept of deterrence and defence will require an entirely new
and innovative concept of protection and projection.

[The nature of future war must also be seen within the context of the
emerging complex strategic coercion that Russia is pioneering.
**[Tech]{.mark}**nology-**[led]{.mark}** [**cross-domain**
**war**]{.mark}fare [will]{.mark} see the battlespace [become an]{.mark}
integrated [**air**, **sea**, **land**, **space**, **cyber**,]{.mark}
information (including electronic warfare) and knowledge
**[super-domain]{.mark}** for the conduct of operations. Faced with such
threats transatlantic political [**cohesion** and]{.mark} Alliance
military [**interoperability** will be **vital**. The Alliance]{.mark}
and its member states [must be in the **vanguard** of the **Revolution**
in **Military Tech**]{.mark}nology that is [now underway.
**A**]{.mark}rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence, **[quantum]{.mark}**
computing and [**machine-learning**, **nano-tech**]{.mark}nologies,
**[drone]{.mark}** and other semi or fully **[autonomous]{.mark}**
delivery systems [are now appearing in a **battlespace** that stretches
from]{.mark} the depths of [the **oceans to outer-space**, **across all
landmasses**]{.mark}, and within and between changing societies and
communities.]{.underline}

[Adapting NATO to meet the strategic challenges of the twenty-first
century must thus be the priority]{.underline} for "NATO@70". [If not,
[there is a]{.mark} very [**real danger** the Alliance will lack the
**nimbleness**]{.mark} to meet strategic change and technological
developments, [and ultimately **fail**]{.mark} as a
consequence]{.underline}. There is also a danger that [Alliance cohesion
will]{.underline} progressively [fade]{.underline} if such ambitions are
not properly enunciated through a new Strategic Concept that enshrines
at its heart a new form of flexible response. Above all, European words
must be matched by European deeds through further organisational and
internal reform to enable a properly agile and modernised Alliance that
would give meaning to the 360-degree approach and enable the Allies to
strike a balance between technology, capability and affordability

[[**NATO cyber-security policy should never stop transforming**, while
**tech**]{.mark}nology [progresses and threats **expand**]{.mark} to a
new and deeply digitized world of insecurity]{.underline} starting with
the case with the cyber-attacks in Estonia in 2007 (Rehman, 2013). [Past

[There is a need of [a resilient cyber-security strategic

Operationally, national and [[**cooperative forces** need to be
**continuously agile**]{.mark} and technologically advanced. In an

Associating smart defense with cyber-resilience: "engagement through
policy adaptation"

As fiscal austerity measures are applied and cutbacks are in effect,
according to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, [NATO allies have to
decide on methods to approach NATOs political agenda
decisions]{.underline}. Allies must enhance capacities and capabilities
to implement new and innovative methods of tactical management for the
benefit of security toward the Alliance space (Chicago Council on Global
Affairs, 2012). According to the Atlantic Council, "...The Alliance,
given its new strategic landscape, currently finds itself in, requires a
new strategy. [[NATO's]{.mark} current three core tasks---[collective
defense]{.mark}, crisis management, and cooperative security---are
['tasks']{.mark} but not strategies---they [do not identity]{.mark} the
full spectrum of [ends, ways, and means]{.mark}, and therefore [do not
tell]{.mark} the Alliance and its [members]{.mark} either [what to
do]{.mark} or the risks involved. NATO has been working diligently but
without great clarity or common agreement as to its end
goals]{.underline} (NATO's Cyber-Defense Policy, 2011)".

Heads of States and Governments do listen and observe, but are not keen
in stepping in the extra mile; to therefore consult and call on NATO to
hold Summit meetings, to negotiate or mitigate current issues, and to
elaborate and concentrate more on economic, political, military and
management innovation and efficiency of administrative cooperation in
all policy regulated fields of NATO.

[A strategic framework policy on "[Smart Defense]{.mark}," which is yet
to be achieved by 2020, may render a cheaper cost for the total sharing
of burden by member states, while [attract]{.mark}ing [more]{.mark}
elements or [variables where tech]{.mark}nology [can be used]{.mark} to
minimize costs]{.underline}. Surely, not all members share the same
burden to this day by are reflective to all countries security defenses
when it comes to cyberspace.

While a policy on smart defense lowers overall long-term cost, and if
burden sharing is actually increased but equaled to lower levels of
fiscal sharing, long-term results will show, that in fact, [less cost
will be achieved and [cyber-innovative methods can]{.mark} help
[mitigate]{.mark} possible [costs]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[While cyber-security becomes a core, NATO policy for smart defense and
resilience attracts attention to stake holders. [Through
evolving]{.mark} and [constant communication]{.mark} and marketing
perspectives, social media and workshops, and conferences, cyber-defense
should continue to be promoted and have a clear aim]{.underline}.
Reflecting on the needs for a global element of cyber-security against
current and emerging challenges, exchange of scientific information and
operational processes promote such ideology, where experts from around
the world exchange information and discuss the risk assessments and how
to manage.

Cyber-security then works as a "decree of specialization, which now
requires adaptation if not done so already for each member state",
politically, strategically, tactically, and operationally but also
legally. Cyber-security must and should always be provided as a
methodological tool for operational success of NATO against current and
emerging threats. It is and will always be a tool for a joint framework
of cooperation, globally.

As smart defense is being upgraded and developed, cyber-defense "...not
a conception but a real-politic issue... (Efthymiopoulos, 2008b)",
should remain an element of specialization policy, a key for concrete
strategic engagement of all resilient member states. It will emerge to
become a policy of innovative unity among states (political) yet also
business continuity (strategic orientation) about the future of NATO
(The entrepreneurial and managerial side of things).

[[NATO's]{.mark} strategic [approach post]{.mark} Warsaw and Brussels of
2017 and [2018]{.mark} Summits is estimated to [reflect a]{.mark} much
need [realistic plan of]{.mark} operations and engagement in the field
of [cyber-security]{.mark} and defense. [NATO]{.mark} should continue to
be collective to be a force projector and force protector. It
[should]{.mark} [not limit its role and actions but should allow and
seek out enlarged coop]{.mark}erations tailored to the global and
regional needs [to counter]{.mark} the existing [challenges]{.mark} or
emerging challenges, considering]{.underline} that as aforementioned
[challenges are now borderless.]{.underline}

[Cyber-security and technological progress within NATO are synonymous.
They can therefore be seen as [the core of]{.mark} collaboration on
[smart defense, to be finalized and achieved by 2020]{.mark} standards.
Cyber-security being technologically advanced is]{.underline} [resilient
to changes]{.underline} [and is innovative as a method as it was never
been done before at NATO until the date that it was presented to. It
[does]{.mark} [provide adaptable]{.mark} technological architecture and
[posture]{.mark}]{.underline}, which will be discussed below considering
the opportunities but also challenges. It will provide robust
deliverables with minimum human capital, fiscal but requests technical
deliverables.

By 2008, seven Alliance countries according to the Memorandum of
Understanding on the cyber-defense center, supported Estonia to get full
operational capability (Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and
Spain), which lead to an evolution period. By 2016, [NATO [Allies are
expected to]{.mark} discuss further and [finalize the framework]{.mark},
logistics, and operations, elements of cyber-resilience and procedures
on the policies, when considering threats and challenges in a changing
environment. NATO is yet to decide on the resilience policy, as hybrid
warfare is developing, at a time when smart defense of NATO nations are
expected to achieve the goals and aims which are to be seen [by]{.mark}
the year [2020]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The cyber-attacks in Estonia of 2007 are still today the biggest and
most organized electronic attack, with a duration period of several
weeks, provided NATO with a motive and multipurpose task for years to
come. [[NATO's leadership was]{.mark} in fact correct in its judgment
that (1) such an operational center and policy was needed, (2) its
operational center would [constantly]{.mark} be [evaluating]{.mark} and
evaluated, and would research on prospective [evolutions in
tech]{.mark}nology, malware, and cyber-security (3) that NATO requires
resilience when considering the current or future threats and
challenges.]{.underline}

[The inauguration of its Cooperative Cyber-Defense Centre of Excellence
(CCDCOE) in Tallinn Estonia in May 2008, led to a mission, which holds a
clear vision and statement. It is yet to be "politically ratified" and
adopted as a key core policy by Allies. Its raison d'être as stated is
"to enhance the cooperative Cyber-Defence capability of NATO and NATO
nations, thus improving the Alliance's interoperability in the field of
cooperative Cyber-Defence,"]{.underline} therefore [reflecting on the
key core elements to counter hybrid threats and be constantly resilience
to strategic requests and needs]{.underline}. The vision is for the
CCDCOE to become "a specialized and expertise center for NATO in
cooperative cyber-defense" (CCDCOE, Training Catalogue, n.d.).

The domain of the cooperative cyber defense center in the framework of
cooperative security within NATO focuses in the fields of research which
include:

"Legal and policy elements"

Concepts and strategy

Tactical environment

Critical information infrastructure protection (NATO, 2016c)

The Centre's core policy created an outcome of research and
policy-orientation, as already analyzed. It was presented primarily as a
first outcome, then accepted by the Supreme Commander Allied Command
Transformation (SACT), deriving from a request of NATO HQ (Headquarters)
and by the North Atlantic Council (NAC) level. This included Doctrine
and Concept Development, Awareness and Training, Research and
Development Analysis, and Lessons learned and finally Consultation.

[In July 2018 during the Brussels NATO meeting, the Heads of States and
Governments agreed to the opening of [the cyberspace center]{.mark} as
part of the new NATO command structure reform that [provides]{.mark}
more agility and [assurances of]{.mark} operational
[preparedness]{.mark}, while ensuring force command operations and
agility]{.underline} (Efthymiopoulos, 2013). [The agreement includes a
creation of policy and action reflecting key core issues including a
framework policy for the cyberspace operations center of NATO to learn
and coordinate in operations how [to counter emerging
challenges.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Results: NATO innovates with reflection to cyber-security

In terms of cyber-security, the [Centre for Excellence in Tallinn
continues to portray and project NATOs need for a methodological
cyber-resilience policy. [At]{.mark} NATO [Brussels]{.mark} summit,
[cyber-security became operational]{.mark}. Therefore, NATOs
cyber-defense policy and [smart]{.mark} efficient [methods]{.mark} while
also requested for more interoperability agility and security resilience
in the field of cyber-security [becomes a core
policy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The attempt as an idea and method to reach out on cyber-security agility
of forces for operations is not a new one. On February 6th and 7th 2009,
NATO's Science for Peace and Security (SPS) sponsored a workshop. It
foresighted the possibility of cyber-security framework. Something we
commend through this article: a framework strategy for operational and
efficient cyber-security to become a core policy of resilience at NATO.
The 2009 workshop titled "Operational Network Intelligence: Today and
tomorrow" aimed at adaptation knowledge procedures considering the
evolving and fast growing technology. It spoke about innovation and
entrepreneurship. It talked about methodological approaches that may
bring allies together, while bring cooperative sides together in
investment through R&D opportunities.

Its overall purpose therefore was to introduce the possibility of
innovation: "rethink present strategies and identify urgent measures to
be taken in order to minimize the strategic and economic impacts of
cyber-attacks" (NATO, 2009b). This was the level of anticipation at the
time; considering future correlation of smart-defense with the policy of
cyber-defense at its core. In 2019, innovation seems to be a sound but
lone option; a process where through cooperative security and military
and technological entrepreneurship NATO can move forward.

[In 2019, considering the risk assessments on hybrid
threats]{.underline} and challenges (Davis Jr., 2015), [the need for
better civil awareness and readiness, at a time of much needed
cooperative defense, [Allies have to decide for a]{.mark} robust
[long-term]{.mark} planning innovative and [entrepreneurial
strategy]{.mark} for current and future operations of NATO. [Keeping in
mind the need for]{.mark} strong [success]{.mark} in field operations,
including success in and at a multi-dimensional level of operations
[against all threats while making op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} to be
[cost efficient]{.mark} with minimum human casualty
numbers.]{.underline}

[NATO increasingly recognizes that organized [cyber-attacks]{.mark} seek
to [take advantage of "gaps"]{.mark} in the "system social and market
matrix."]{.underline} Therefore, it should be a request from member
states to examine the increasing need for coordination of human factors
related to the issues of electronic warfare, operational network,
intelligence, and cyber-defense, whether for training, scientific
exchange, and or operations (NATO Review, 2015).

NATO is currently using people involved in e-systems, security, IT
engineers, researches, officers dealing with network operations and
operational centres, as well as professional and academics, among others
including military specialists. [[Specialists]{.mark} in the field on
both a strategic and tactical levels [should continue to be
systematically involved]{.mark} at organized levels of research,
sharing, discussion, and exhibition of outcomes, [which will]{.mark} in
turn [enrich]{.mark} the abilities, capabilities, and capacities of
rendering current [smart-defense]{.mark} and cyber-security [as
a]{.mark} key and [successful]{.mark} resilient and collaborative
[defense policy to NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**NATO's proving its capable of innovative tech development now**

Blueprints for the future?

[The [**future outlook** for **disruptive tech**]{.mark}nology [is
**not**]{.mark} entirely **[negative]{.mark}**. Two [**new initiatives**
show]{.mark} exceptional [promise to invert traditional]{.mark}
capability development [models]{.mark}, while seizing upon the
opportunities offered by new technology. [They demonstrate]{.mark}
vividly [how **NATO adapts.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The first is [the Maritime Unmanned Systems
Initiative]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here, 14 Allies have committed to a
cooperative framework for developing and integrating unmanned systems
into NATO's defence architecture.2 The project is aimed at bringing
autonomy and unmanned capability to bear in support of tedious and
dangerous jobs at sea, including anti-submarine and counter-mine
warfare. Beyond leveraging new technology, the project is also
leveraging a "start up" mindset for agility and lean approaches. The
project has benefi ted from experience drawn from industry, academia,
and government, including Coca Cola and the Pentagon's Defense
Innovation Unit. This model has already paid dividends: less than a year
after the fi rst commitment was taken, the largest-ever exercise of NATO
unmanned underwater, surface and air vehicles took place off Portugal.3

[The second initiative is [the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control
capability]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a novel example of obsolescence
management, NATO leaders have committed to cooperate towards defi ning a
replacement for NATO's AWACS fl eet in anticipation of its retirement
around 2035. The project launched in 2016 with a fundamental
re-evaluation of NATO's future needs, eschewing any assumptions that
AWACS would simply undergo a "likefor-like" replacement. The project has
since arrived at capability requirements that drive for an integration
of surveillance and C2 across multiple domains. Allied industries have
now been challenged to offer ideas on how NATO's requirements could be
fulfi lled by 2035. Up to six concepts are being sought in order to
encourage a wide variety of innovative solutions, including those that
leverage emerging and disruptive technologies.

[Both of these projects [are in their early steps. Nevertheless]{.mark},
their models [are contesting]{.mark} the [traditional approaches to
defence acquisition]{.mark} by **[embracing disruptive
tech]{.mark}**nology, tapping into industry expertise, and [**leaving
space** for **future capability growth**]{.mark}**.** These projects
[**offer promise** for]{.mark} the [**future adaptability** and
**agility** of **NATO capability development**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
as such deserve close attention and support.

**[Link Wall\-\--2NC]{.underline}**

**Commitment\-\--fully embracing emerging tech requires a defense
posture that accounts for the uncertainty of future
developments\-\--broad acceptance of risk increases the demand for new
tech innovations**

[In twenty-first century security affairs, NATO forces are required to
be well prepared for possible rules of engagement at all levels and
dimensions. They should be able [to counter]{.mark} symmetrical and
asymmetrical battles, threats or challenges, **[hybrid]{.mark}** or
non-hybrid. At the level of cyber-security and cyber-resilience and
preparedness, scenarios, of possible attacks and battles, can be
anticipated. Along the lines of the new cyber-space operations center,
NATO should prepare operational methods for action, whether this is for
defense or cooperation for cyber-space.]{.underline}

The use and necessity today of technology is limitless. So is the
virtual world of defense and security, where technology and
cyber-defense merge. These are the tools for action.
[**[Tech]{.mark}**nology [plays a **key role**]{.mark} in a global
reach. Yet [**so does NATO**, through the **framework** of]{.mark} a
**[limitless tech]{.mark}**nology applied [in **military
op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}**. NATO uses technology to train,
prepare, ready, deploy, and operate its forces.]{.underline} Technology
for NATO works as tools with which the Alliance protects and defend, yet
also is capable to counter-assault, with counter-measures where and when
is needed, required, or decided.

[Since the adoption of the NATO Cyber-Defense policy]{.underline}
(NATO's Cyber-Defense Policy, 2011), [[NATO trains]{.mark} its military
and civilian assets [for **possible action** against **possible
threats**.]{.mark} NATO is **[constantly]{.mark}** training its forces
in cyber defense]{.underline} training can be achieved through national,
bilateral even multilateral levels of NATO, [through the association of
member states, at the level of Centres of Excellence, such as the NATO
Cyber-Defense Centre for Excellence (CCDCOE)]{.underline} (NATO, n.d.)
[and now through the Cyberspace Operations center]{.underline} in Mons
Belgium. [[**Training and exercises** are]{.mark} now [anticipated to
**expand and enlarge**. So are **multinational
op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} held through remote areas
and locations. [[NATO is now to get **more engaged**]{.mark} in the
field of **cyber-defense**, in both operations and tactics. It is
anticipated within the Alliance that NATO is **well prepared**, both
[for **current** and **future**]{.mark} challenges, countering multiple
and multileveled dimensions of **[cyber-attacks]{.mark}**. Yet, it also
holds an open option, if necessary, to conduct counter-offensives to
prevent further escalation of cyber or military actions]{.underline}
(Hughes, 2009).

[NATO Missions, "will continue to require agile and interoperable,
well-trained and well-led military forces"]{.underline} (Carayannis,
Campbell & Efthymiopoulos, 2014). [This new technological and
operational environment through cyber-defense provides NATO with a new
level of technological possibilities, new tools for use against possible
threats but also protective "cyber-objectives." Allies have an added
policy, mission, and value. [**Ongoing** and **constant**
transformation]{.mark} through its operational and capacity building
resilience, [aims to reach]{.mark} in [**updated capabilities** and
**political excellence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in 2016. NATO aims for
well-coordinated missions in cooperation with and/or participation with
other international organizations, when prompted to react on
international threats or challenges. As such, [NATO has the ability to
continue to be a force and security provided in future potential
of]{.underline}, what we may call it, [the "online" security protection
initiative against all possibly known threats.]{.underline}

[NATO seeks excellence, in [achieving the **best**]{.mark} smartest
**[way to protect]{.mark}** but also counter-attack. By "nature," NATO
exists to prevent and defend member states from attacks. Through **smart
ways** and **agile training**, NATO can counter most known ways of
interface (whether virus or virtual) attacks or even e-spying
attempts.]{.underline}

**Decision-making framework\-\--centralizing decision gates through
complicated management structures ensures capabilities will be over
budget, late, and obsolete when delivered\-\--government limitations get
in the way of 'business-led' innovations**

[During]{.underline} the year [2018, there was a new]{.underline}
security cultural security [comprehension]{.underline}; it is
[considered]{.underline} as [multi-leveled and
multi-dimensional]{.underline}. In 2018's NATO summit of July, [allies
evaluated current developments in cyber-security]{.underline}
considering challenges, threats, but also opportunities. Evaluated
current strategic and geopolitical challenges. [They upheld
methodological preparedness for network defense and operations and
declared under the new NATO command structural reform the setting up of
a cyberspace operations center]{.underline}, as part of the adapted
command structure. [Allies now request for more awareness and openness,
innovation methods, and capacity building in cyber-security, considering
changes in the market economy, more tangible and operational capacity
building through R&D companies. [**Any decision**, considering the
**changing nature of security**]{.mark} and strategic market, [should be

**[[Defense capacity building]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the twentieth
century [[requires a **modern way of thinking**]{.mark}. It is about
**[encouraging cooperative defense]{.mark}** at the level of expected
outcomes considering global but also regional risk
assessments.]{.underline} NATO is still to enhance but also maintaining
military capacities and military capabilities.

[The new strategic concept of NATO requests the alliance to move
forward. Twenty-first century needs and challenges require agility and
compatibility of forces and force command at all levels, including
network-centric operations and defense.]{.underline}

[NATO forces, force command, technology, and **[methodological
approach]{.mark}** in military elements and standards [**cannot**
be]{.mark} or remain [**static**. They need to]{.mark} technologically
advance, progress methodologically innovate, to [accommodate for
the]{.mark} increasing need for **[multi-dimensional ways of

[In an emerging globalized world, where complexity may become a key
characteristic in strategy and security, **resilience** will become an
**integrated** part of NATOs policy orientation and
application.]{.underline} [[**New**]{.mark} vulnerabilities and
[**threats** continue to emerge. Political pressure will require
NATO]{.mark} leaders [to **take decisions**]{.mark} about the
organization's future]{.underline}. Yet all agree that NATO is a
necessity. As such, [[NATO should become **more open**]{.mark}, more

more burden sharing, [[**better smart**]{.mark} budgeting,]{.underline}

In the not so long past, such similar actions reaffirmed by the Heads of
States, included among others, the Treaty of London in 1990 Summit, to
the 1994 Summit in Brussels, and in 1999 over its 50th year anniversary
Summit in Washington, to the immediate decisions taken in 2001 after the
terrorist acts in the USA (NATO, 2001b) to its 60th anniversary, which
was held in Strasbourg and Kiehl accordingly in April 2009 to the
Chicago Summit of 2012 and the Wales Summit of 2014, which added value
to the Alliance and Allies reaffirming NATOs long-term necessity but now
also strategic resilience to multi-dimensional challenges and threats.

[**[NATO's]{.mark} concept of [cyber-defense]{.mark}** in
2019]{.underline}

It was NATO's Military Committee decision to adopt a "Cyber-Defense
Concept" (Efthymiopoulos, 2008e). The Committee's aim was and still is
to deliver business continuity and military resilience. [[As]{.mark}
NATO is a [provider of **collective defense**]{.mark} and as a
collective organization in a globalized and currently unsafe e-world, it
[needs to be **agile**]{.mark}. In an environment of insecurity, the
Alliance' delivers new policy results. Taking into perspective **new**
forms of asymmetrical **threats**, such as cyber-attacks.]{.underline}

Historically, [the 2002 Prague Summit first marked NATO's tasking
authority committee with regards to **all activities** that should be
held in relations to **cyber-defense**. **As tech**nical **achievements
were delivered**, so **policy-makers delivered policy** results on
cyber-defense. That is why, [Allied leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} during
the Riga Summit of 2006 [[acknowledged the need to]{.underline}]{.mark}
include these as is stated on its decisions at the Press Communiqué: (1)
to [protect NATO's operational information systems, and]{.underline} (2)
to [**[protect]{.mark}** its allied [countries from
**any**]{.mark}]{.underline} e-, or in other words
[**[cyber-attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} by new forms and means
developed by NATO's Allied Command Transformation (ACT) In Norfolk
Virginia.

[The output of the informal Meeting of the Ministers of Defense in
October 2007]{.underline} of NATO (NATO Defence Ministers Meeting, 2007)
[gave way to the inauguration of NATO's Center for Excellence (COE),
which at a later stage got accredited to]{.underline} have
[become]{.underline} the Allied Command Transformation on cyber-defense,
named as [Cooperative Cyber-Defense Centre of Excellence,
CCDCOE]{.underline} (NATO, 2008a). It [was [based on]{.mark} the concept
and early understanding of **[cyber-resilience]{.mark}** for NATO's
future policies in countering challenges and threats]{.underline}, as
was agreed by NATO's Military Committee.

[The central and final decision-making role over the policy of
cyber-defense however is the North Atlantic Council (NAC),]{.underline}
which accordingly is [led by Heads of State and Governments. This is the
highest deciding political authority which decides, creates, and
overviews policy.]{.underline} It also evaluates, considers, and adopts
NATO's policies and activities with regards to political and military
affairs or standing issues on challenges and threats, among others.
Below the NAC, is NATO's Consultation Control and Command Agency (NC3A)
(NATO NC3A, 2002) now transformed to the NCIA agency (NATO, 2008a) and
the NATO Military Authorities (NMA). The latter authority has
implementation as its major task (NATO's Cyber-Defence policy, 2008).

[The implementation of NATO's cyber-defense policy is considered as the
second most important decision by now, once the decisions are taken by
the NAC. The "Concept of Cyber-Defence" "adds practical action
**[programmes]{.mark}**, to [fit within]{.mark} the **[overarching
policy]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (NATO, 2009a). The "Cyber-Defence
Management Authority" that is tasked upon its policy concept "brings
together the key actors in NATO's Cyber-Defence activities." [Its aim is
[to]{.mark} manage and [support **all NATO**]{.mark} communication and
information networked **[systems]{.mark}** and individually allies upon
request]{.underline} (NATO, 2008c).

[NATO's policy creation and activity is "encouraged" by Allies. [The aim
is to **adapt the alliance to**]{.mark} the new strategic and security
environment that is "**[hybrid]{.mark}**" and [thus]{.mark} the creation
of [the **cyber**]{.mark}space operations **[center]{.mark}** in Mons in
Belgium. [To engage **as many**]{.mark} as **possible**
**[governments]{.mark}**, industry-related market [**companies**, and
**individuals**]{.mark}. In accordance to its best practice policy, NATO
considers that its "operational forum" can and should be considered as
the **best joint** operational **[coop]{.mark}**eration [between states
and market]{.mark}, as to also [avoid **duplication of efforts** and use
the **necessary**]{.mark} global [**knowledge** to achieve
**interoperability**]{.mark} of force action and **command** also in
cyber-space.]{.underline}

[Practically, in military policy, implementation, or operational areas,
NATO has adopted "three phases of practical activity and
cooperation":]{.underline} the initial phase includes a NATO Computer
Incident Response Capability (NCIRC). It was established as "interim
operating capability" for NATO to build up on both security risk and
manage the element of cyber-threats. Its second phase involved an ever
more realistic and pragmatic perspective that required the coordination
of all initial "offering" states to the attempt to establish a
cyber-center (under the NATO agreement between states of a voluntary
national contribution---VNC), in bringing the NCIRC to a full
operational capability (NATO, 2008c).

New and innovative policies were adopted. They were proposed and came to
effect (well-known procedure of internal NATO working process) until the
adoption of "MoU"; a memorandum of understanding was drafted and
proposed to NATO, by a sponsoring state which would establish a center
for cyber-training, in this case in Estonia.

From that point on, it became an administrative decision of the Allies,
that once the aforementioned stages would be put into effect, then a
third phase would come into existence. Needless to say, [this third
phase was a complete implementation and **[rule-based]{.mark}**
operational **[procedure]{.mark}** that would soon enough bring about
into existence NATO's request for technological agility and
resilience]{.underline}, which is finalized at the Warsaw Summit of July
2016. [It [consists of]{.mark} incorporating---**lessons
learned**---from the prior two phases as [using]{.mark} new and
**[latest]{.mark}** cyber-defense measures (use of new
**[tech]{.mark}**nology and getting more knowledge on the security
environment), in order [to enhance]{.mark} **cyber-defense
[posture]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Once the third phase was evaluated, the
Allied Command Transformation (ACT) decided, to accredit the operational
center---in this case the Cooperative Cyber Defense (CCD) COE (Estonia),
what is called as a "Centre of Excellence". In turn, this resulted to
the inauguration of the CCDCOE by May 2008.

cyberdefense integration**

[The Wales Summit Declaration]{.underline}8 was a major step forward in
acknowledging the challenges posed by complex cyberattacks. It was the
first official document in which the Member Nations of the Alliance
confirmed the possibility of a cyberattack to cross the threshold of an
armed attack and thus become the basis for invoking Article 5 of the
North Atlantic Treaty. It was reiterated that cyberthreats and attacks
would continue to become more common, sophisticated, and potentially
damaging. In Paragraph 72, the Alliance Nations declared that:

"Cyberattacks can reach a threshold that threatens national and
EuroAtlantic prosperity, security, and stability. Their impact could be
as harmful to modern societies as a conventional attack. We affirm
therefore that cyber defence is part of NATO's core task of collective
defence. A decision as to when a cyberattack would lead to the
invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on
a case-by-case basis."

[This clearly demonstrates [the Alliance's view]{.mark} whereby
cyberattacks can cross the threshold of an armed attack, allowing
individual or collective self-defence to be invocated under both Article
51 of the UN Charterand Article 5 of the North Atlantic
Treaty]{.underline}. Moreover, for the first time since NATO took on the
topic of cyberdefence in 2006, it was explicitly stated that
cyberdefence became part of the Alliance's collective defence tasks and
efforts.

[The Member Nations adopted the Enhanced Cyber Defence Policy (ECDP)
which [reaffirms]{.mark} the principles of the [**indivisibility** of
Allied security]{.mark} and of prevention, detection, resilience,
recovery, and defence and clearly states that]{.underline} "(...)[the
fundamental cyber defence responsibility of NATO is to defend its own
networks, and that assistance to Allies should be addressed in
accordance with the spirit of solidarity, [emphasizing]{.mark} the
**[responsibility]{.mark}** of Allies [to develop]{.mark} the
[**relevant capabilities** for]{.mark} the [protection]{.mark} of
national networks."]{.underline} The ECDP recognises the applicability
of international law to cyber operations, including the International
Humanitarian Law (IHL) or the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC).

[The Nations committed themselves to further develop their national
cyberdefence capabilities and enhance the cybersecurity of their
networks, upon which the Alliance depends]{.underline}. NATO's top
priority for cyberdefence is the protection of NATO-owned communications
and information systems (CIS); however, [[the Alliance will **assist**
the Nations in defending their national networks **considered critical**
for NATO's missions]{.mark}.]{.underline} For this purpose, [the
Alliance cooperates with national authorities to ensure an appropriate
level of cyberdefence of national CIS.]{.underline} Such cooperation is
being formalised in Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) signed between the
Cyber Defence Management Board and the respective nations. Cyberdefence
MOUs are based upon a template developed in the Cyber Defence Action
Plan in line with the principles of the ECDP. [They set the foundations
for mutual support in the area of cyberdefence, including
**[info]{.mark}**rmation **[sharing]{.mark}**, participation in
**[training]{.mark}** and **[exercises]{.mark}** as well as the
provision of reciprocal assistance in the form of
**[intel]{.mark}**ligence and **["manpower"]{.mark}**]{.underline} [(CIS
specialists and cyberdefence experts).]{.underline} The Czech Republic
was the first NATO Nation to sign such a MOU on 12 October 2015.9
Assistance to Allies may be provided by one of the Rapid Reaction Teams
formed by the NCIA as part of the Alliance's collective cyberdefence
capability.10

[The Wales Summit Declaration further [provided]{.mark} for a continued
[**integration** of cyberdefence into **NATO
op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}** and operational and contingency
planning, as well as the enhancement of information sharing and
situational awareness among Allies. The key role of partnerships in
addressing cyberthreats was stressed.]{.underline}

Also [the ECDP requires NATO to include cyberdefence aspects in the
**[defence planning]{.mark}** process.]{.underline} This has been
achieved by implementing respective cyberdefence annexes in Operations
Plans (OPLANs) developed for real-life operations, training and
exercises as well as contingency plans. The training and exercise
programme has grown to include cyber-specific exercises such as Cyber
Coalition and Locked Shields. In addition, an extensive cyberdefence
play has been incorporated into more "classic" training and exercises,
including the biggest NATO exercise over the last decade -- Trident
Juncture 15 and Coalition Warrior Interoperability eXploration,
eXperimentation, eXamination, eXercise (CWIX), to which the Joint Force
Training Centre has been the proud host for the last five years.11

[One of the most important aspects of the NATO ECDP is cooperation in
broad terms: with NATO Nations]{.underline} (as described above),
[Partner Nations, international actors such as the UN and the EU,
industry and academia.]{.underline} [**[Coop]{.mark}**eration [with
**industry** has been formalised]{.mark} in the NATO Industry Cyber
Partnership (NICP), which was founded and endorsed by the Alliance
**[based]{.mark}** up[**on** the conclusion]{.mark} that [NATO and
industry faced **shared risks**]{.mark} in cyberspace, and that
addressing these challenges required new frameworks for action. Within
the NICP framework, the NCIA has launched the cybersecurity incubator
concept tasked to develop a new model for NATO-industry cooperation with
the aim to decrease the time required for NATO to develop its cyber
response capabilities, based upon the results of research and
development programmes already run by industry and
academia.]{.underline}

There are many other cooperation frameworks such as the Cyber
Information and Incident Coordination System (CIIS), a web-based
application developed for sharing cyberdefence information within a
trusted community and available to all NATO Nations and Partner Nations
as well as commercial organizations.

NATO does not develop offensive cyber capabilities. Although the
Alliance focuses on defence against cyberattacks, it does not preclude
particular Member Nations from developing their own national offensive
cyber capabilities. In fact, there are nations who openly admit they
pursue such capabilities involving "(...)countering (disorganising,
jamming and destroying) the sources of threats (active defence and
offensive actions) (...)".12 As a matter of fact, NATO Rules of
Engagement13 in Series 36 (Information Operations) envisage the
possibility of conducting offensive computer network operations (namely
Computer Network Attacks -- CNAs); however, none of these offensive ROEs
have been authorised so far by the North Atlantic Council in operations
or exercises.

This short text hopefully illustrates how [NATO's approach to
cyberdefence has evolved over the last decade to culminate in a
[**clear** and **unambiguous** declaration that **cyberattacks can
trigger**]{.mark} the invocation of **[Article 5]{.mark}.** While the
Alliance is committed to assist Allies in their defence efforts, it
encourages the Member Nations to develop their own cyberdefence
capabilities in the spirit of Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty.
This evolutionary approach [should be **continued** to ensure the
**adaptation**]{.mark} of the Alliance's cyberdefence policy [to **new
trends**]{.mark} in cyber operations, [including]{.mark} the development
of response options to]{.underline} e.g.:

[1) cyber actions amounting to armed attacks;]{.underline}

[2) [the possibility of a **broader application** of cyber means]{.mark}
and methods [of war]{.mark}fare [in **future
conflicts**]{.mark};]{.underline}

[3) terrorist acts with the use of cyber means.]{.underline}

[**[Adaptability]{.mark}** and **[flexibility]{.mark}** as well as [a
**broad range of response**]{.mark} options [are a **must**]{.mark} in
the world where the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure are no
secret and neither is the reliance of countries on critical
infrastructure]{.underline} which in many cases is shared between two or
more countries.

**Baltic participation in tech innovation to counter hybrid threats

To an extent, then, the [developed [expertise]{.mark} in [combatting
cyber threats can]{.mark}]{.underline} and already has
**[[enable]{.underline}]{.mark}**d [the [Baltic]{.mark} state[**s** to
**set multilateral standards and**]{.mark} **craft [collective]{.mark}
policy [solutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the field. And yet, [with
the increasingly widespread appreciation of hybrid and next-generation
threats, the comparative advantage the Baltics have today will likely
decrease in the future. Should Baltic politicians]{.underline} wish to
[further pursue [leadership in cyber and hybrid security]{.mark}, they
[will **require further policy innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline} (a
similar note could be made about the self-declared Baltic expertise on
Russian/Eastern Neighborhood questions more broadly).

The Baltics, certainly, may also focus on other areas in which they play
a unique role and boast unique expertise. Today, individual Baltic
states have made significant inroads in developing notable expertise in
e-governance (Estonia) or fintech (Lithuania). Survey respondents from
Latvia and Estonia also demonstrate high appreciation for and diverse
understanding of the impact the rising pace of technological change is
likely have on Baltic politics. For both sets of respondents, this trend
ranks among the top three and is connected with various economic,
societal, and security risks (by contrast, increasing cyber-dependence
is primarily through the security lens).

Whether they choose [[to further develop]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[hybrid and cyber capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} or expand their
focus to different fields, the [[Baltic states stand to benefit
from]{.mark} international **[coop]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}. As
[**[continuous]{.mark} policy [innovation requires new inputs]{.mark}**,
seeking diverse [international partnerships]{.mark} can greatly
[augment]{.mark} the [policy instruments]{.mark} currently employed by
the Baltic states]{.underline}. For example, should the Baltic
governments focus on the trend of ageing population (among the experts
surveyed, it ranked as the most important trend in the Baltic region),
the could consult the expertise and experience of Japan, which has
recently developed an ambitious strategy of tackling the transformation
into a digital society for an ageing population.11

ACTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE MEMBERSHIP

Unique expertise alone is not sufficient for small states to shape the
international order with the use of postwar institutions -- there is a
difference between being a one-issue state and the leader on the issue.
[[Small states must]{.mark} **simultaneously [be]{.mark} active and
[constructive partners]{.mark}** [to other members of the core group
of]{.mark} the [postwar order]{.mark}]{.underline}. As their
institutional innovations need the assent and backing of greater powers
to have any tangible effect, [fostering stable and [productive
partnerships with key allied powers]{.mark} to secure their buy-in
[is]{.mark} a [necessary]{.mark} tactic for small states]{.underline}.

[NATO has a]{.underline} **[strong role]{.underline}** [in coordinating

[in strengthening defence ties]{.underline} among its members and

**Bolstering hybrid response in the Baltics is the [first
step]{.underline} towards broader NATO/EU adoption**

Andrew **Radin 17**, political scientist at the RAND Corporation, 2017,
"Hybrid Warfare in the Baltics: Threats and Potential Responses,"
https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1500/RR1577/RAND_RR1577.pdf

[[Improving]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[response to]{.underline}]{.mark}
potential [[Russian covert action can be]{.mark} thought of in [three
phases]{.mark}: detecting and [attributing Russian
action]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[strengthening]{.underline}**]{.mark}
the [[**capacity of the Baltics to respond**, and **formulating an
effective**]{.mark} **and appropriate [EU and NATO
response]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Better intelligence gathering and coordination and a clearer
understanding of the signs of Russian covert aggression can help bolster
defenses against active subversion. U.S. Air Force assets, such as
unmanned aerial vehicles and ground-based radars, could be beneficial at
filling gaps in these countries' existing intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance capabilities, both for covert action and conventional
warfare.7 [[NATO is]{.underline}]{.mark} also currently
[[undertaking]{.mark} several [initiatives to improve
**intel**]{.mark}ligence [and coordination]{.mark} related [to Russian
covert action]{.mark}]{.underline}, including developing shared
indicators and warnings, NATO Force Integration Units (NFIUs), and
combined exercises. Although NATO has made progress in developing
institutions for intelligence sharing, NATO's structures and processes
for intelligence sharing remain cumbersome and dependent on
often-reluctant nations to share.8 Given NATO's slow progress in this
area, [further [developing bilateral]{.mark} intelligence [sharing
between]{.mark} the [Baltic countries and]{.mark}]{.underline} the
United States or [[other NATO countries could be
valuable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Additional research could also contribute
by identifying the signs and mechanisms of past instances of large-scale
Russian covert activities in Georgia, Crimea, and eastern Ukraine. So
far, there is little open source information about how to differentiate
between "everyday" Russian exercises and influence operations and the
start of a large-scale campaign mirroring the operation in Crimea. More
clearly identifying the modus operandi of Russian agents would help to
separate out the cases that justify a NATO deployment and those that
might not.

The capacity of the Baltic countries to counter covert action can
certainly be improved. U.S. special operations forces have conducted
extensive engagement with their Baltic counterparts, to the point that
there is a sense of saturation, especially given the small size of the
Baltic special operations forces. Additional research may be beneficial
to help identify gaps in the Baltic countries' capacity, including
within civilian agencies, and to conduct targeted missions that could
offer more focused benefits. Support for the Baltic states to counter
covert action may also strengthen their ability to resist Russia in the
event of an invasion.9 The U.S. Air Force may be able to directly assist
with the development of technical capabilities for border control, air
and maritime domain awareness, and intelligence gathering, including
assistance with acquiring unmanned aerial vehicles, radars, and other
sensors. Another specific area where the United States may be able to
offer assistance is in planning exercises and war games to improve
contingency planning and coordination, especially in Latvia.

Finally, the United States, [[NATO, and the Baltic countries can do
more]{.mark} to think practically through how a response to Russian
covert action would proceed]{.underline}. The 2014 Wales Summit focused
on the development of greater "responsiveness" through the Readiness
Action Plan and the creation of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force
(VJTF). However, it remains uncertain how these new, more responsive
forces would be employed if there was warning of a significant Russian
covert (or conventional) military action in the Baltics.10 While the
development of the VJTF and implementation of the Readiness Action Plan
is complex and will take time, [[it is highly beneficial for]{.mark} the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and other [NATO allies
to think through]{.mark} on a practical level [how]{.mark} a
[high-readiness forces would deploy]{.mark} and be employed [in the
Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}, and how they would coordinate its actions
with the Baltic security forces.

Sceptics will say this would present big tech with too many
opportunities for mergers and acquisitions and thus create monopolistic
risk. They might be right and clearly incentives for all parties would
need to be found. But, [[if we are to win the **tech**]{.mark}nological
[**adoption race** built]{.mark} up[on]{.mark} [**liberal democratic

have**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[To **utilise**, **adopt** and **scale**]{.mark} these technologies
[effectively, we must have]{.mark} at the forefront of our minds the
need to [work at the **speed of relevance** rather than the **speed of
approval**. This means **new**]{.mark} ways of **[financing]{.mark}**
technologies, interacting with tech firms both big and small, and much

empowerment and [**incentives** to]{.mark} those responsible for
**[equip]{.mark}**ping **[the Alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Such a
cultural shift will not be easy -- but innovation rarely is.

[As we look towards NATO 2030]{.underline} and heed Eisenhower's words

[But before we get to commercialisation, we need to create the direction
of what it is we wish to see commercialised. Technological disruptive
[innovation]{.mark} does not just happen. It [starts with a
**mission-oriented vision**, where **measuring risk** is impossible
and]{.mark} only [**uncertainty** reigns. It requires **bold moves**
that will **signpost the future**; the **confidence** to place **big
bets** on tech]{.mark}nology [not yet invented; and an ability to **pick
winners**]{.mark} -- all of [which must be underpinned by **persistent
engagement**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} encouragement and
enlightenment. Since the end of the Second World War, only one entity
has taken-on such uncertainty: Allied governments (see image below).

Step 1: agree innovation priorities among Allies

[[The **first step** towards **fixing**]{.mark} the
**[fragmentation]{.mark}** of Allied disruptive innovation [is for
Allies, through the **NATO framework**, to focus on **agreed innovation
priorities**.]{.mark} This will allow them to pick winners and invest
public patient capital]{.underline} -- the private sector is unlikely to
invest venture capital as the risk is simply too high (nations tend not
to go out of business and can take on such uncertainty). [This
[**direction** and **investment** will]{.mark} help to [maintain
NATO's]{.mark} overarching **[tech]{.mark}**nological
**[edge]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Indeed, as Keynes and Weber argued, [the
ability to make things happen that otherwise would not needs a
combination of technological, policy and bureaucratic skills matched by
investment]{.underline}

**Networking is key to maximize innovation**

Step 2: leverage the comparative advantage of the Alliance

[If Allies are [to achieve most defence at less cost with least
delay]{.mark} built with wisdom and efficiency, then it is logical to
[leverage]{.mark} those natural [advantages that **geography** and
**skill sets** afford]{.mark} NATO **[member]{.mark}**
state**[s]{.mark}**. [A **network** of the finest universities]{.mark}
across the Alliance [should be established and resourced to allow
**cutting-edge multinational research** to take place across **multiple
disruptive tech**]{.mark}nologies **[simultaneously]{.mark}**. Perhaps
Stanford could lead on relevant AI research, while Delft and the
University of Chicago partner on quantum; maybe Imperial College London
looks at biotechnologies with Johns Hopkins University, while Tallinn
University centres its efforts on next generation cyber defences; and
the École Polytechnique and Massachusetts Institute of Technology
examine future telecommunication needs.]{.underline}

The point is [[**Allies** will need to leverage such networks]{.mark} of
universities [in **conjunction** with]{.mark} national
**[government]{.mark}** research [labs to provide **maximum innovation
coherence**.]{.mark} The [**diversity** of]{.mark} multinational,
multi-disciplined defence and security innovation [research
teams]{.mark}, which NATO can engender, [is a **huge asset** and]{.mark}
is [the Alliance's **competitive advantage**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Utilise, adopt and scale

[Where the first stage of NATO's innovation pipeline should centre on
the creation of disruptive innovative technologies, stage two is all
about their [**utilisation** and **adoption at
scale.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Utilisation

[This [is where]{.mark} initial **[public]{.mark}** venture capital
(**[VC]{.mark}**) entities]{.underline}, such as in-q-tel, NSSIF,
DefInvest and SmartCap, [[can]{.mark} help **['crowd in']{.mark}**
trusted **[private v]{.mark}**enture **[c]{.mark}**apital [to provide
**safe financing**]{.mark} to NATO's fledgling start-ups, thereby
[minimising]{.mark} their [susceptibility to **nefarious
f**]{.mark}oreign **[d]{.mark}**irect **[i]{.mark}**nvestment. This
issue is [impacting]{.mark} many [start-ups]{.mark} as they raise funds
and carries implications [when they wish to **export**]{.mark} their
products [but may not]{.mark} be able to, [due to **unfriendly foreign
ownership** and **tech**]{.mark}nology [**transfer** concerns]{.mark}
raised by Allied governments.]{.underline}

In addition to Venture Capital entities supporting the trusted financing
of Allied start-ups, **[[innovation accelerators]{.underline}]{.mark}**
-- in combination with elite universities, and [[supported by **Allied
defence professionals**]{.underline}]{.mark} (operators, investors and
procurement experts) -- [[can]{.mark} help [provide the **necessary
'polish'**]{.mark} to start-ups and their value propositions. This will
create the necessary ecosystem [to **maximise**]{.mark} the
[**likelihood** of **commercial success**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
United States' Air Force Ventures is an interesting model of this
approach, which helps to acquire new start-up products at speed without
being bogged down by acquisition bureaucracy.

**Startups need NATO to get off the ground**

Adoption

But even when dual-use disruptive innovation is commercialised, turned
into prototypes and the product/market fit is achieved, [the challenge
of getting initial contracts from customers]{.underline} (both
government and commercial) remains. [Cash is king for **[young
companies]{.mark}**, as they [do not have]{.mark} the [**financial
reserves** to work through **long acquisition processes**]{.mark} often
[associated with **Allied governments**]{.mark}. If start-ups cannot
close deals in a matter of weeks and months rather than quarters and
years, then they would not attempt to (opportunity cost).]{.underline}

Now, some commentators may argue: Why spend so much time discussing
start-ups? Traditional large armaments companies can be innovative. Why
go through all this effort for tiny companies that may or may not make
it?

The reason is simple: [the competition and creativity generated by
**[start-ups]{.mark}** is good for the **Allied defence ecosystem**.
Allied open democracies and open educational models bring about levels
of creativity which other forms of government are unable to do. This
[**maximises**]{.mark} disruptive [innovation]{.mark} efforts and, as
such, [forces incumbents]{.mark} (large companies) [to
**compete**]{.mark} with new, fresh thinking -- it [builds
**resilience**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Such [**creativity** and **disruption** is **NATO's competitive
advantage**]{.mark}. Therefore, [NATO needs to]{.mark} adapt its
acquisition models to [accommodate start-ups,]{.mark} their timelines
and their potential. This fundamentally means our acquisition
professionals should be empowered to take measurable risk]{.underline}.
As one Ally's legislative body recently remarked: "[[Defence
stakeholders must **integrate the risk culture**]{.mark}, which is [the
**only way** to both **enable innovation**]{.mark} in defence and to
very quickly capture dual or civilian innovation. Acculturation to
innovation is a priority]{.underline}."

Scaling

[If we have managed to commercialise new technology, adopt it quickly as
a prototype and now wish to scale, how might this be done? Big tech
could have a role to play here]{.underline}. In May, it was reported
that, in the first quarter of 2020, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet
and Microsoft spent over 29 billion US dollars on research and
development (R&D). That is more than the entire 2020 NASA budget and
represents a 17 per cent increase on the same time period last year.

In November 2018, the US Congressional Research Service noted: "In 1960,
the United States accounted for 69% of global R&D, with U.S.
defense-related R&D alone accounting for more than one-third of global
R&D (36%). Additionally, the federal government funded approximately
twice as much R&D as U.S. business. However, from 1960 to 2016, the U.S.
share of global R&D fell to 28%, and the federal government's share of
total U.S. R&D fell from 65% to 24%, while business's share more than
doubled from 33% to 67%. As a result of these global, national, and
federal trends, federal defense R&D's share of total global R&D fell to
3.7% in 2016."

[[**Big tech** has the **resources** and **wherewithal**]{.mark} to be
able [to **scale new tech**]{.mark}nologies [at **speed**. They
could]{.mark} partner with successful start-ups, perhaps
[through]{.mark} a joint venture or [an **Alliance-wide
p**]{.mark}ublic-**[p]{.mark}**rivate **[p]{.mark}**artnership, to
[provide]{.mark} those [scale-up skills that start-ups lack]{.mark} (for
example, [compliance, legal support, production on mass,
i]{.mark}ntellectual [p]{.mark}roperty [protection]{.mark})]{.underline}
without necessarily acquiring these young companies.

[[A dual-use model is important]{.mark} for disruptive defence
innovation because when we eventually get to commercialising such
tough-tech breakthroughs, Allies will need start-ups and tech firms [to
maximise]{.mark} the [reach of]{.mark} their [products]{.mark} by
looking at 'total addressable problems' rather than 'total addressable
markets'.]{.underline} In other words, we should not want start-ups
building the next wave of technology to have governments as their only
customer. We want such technologies to benefit society too and therefore
have civil, commercial use. Such [[commercial use]{.underline}]{.mark}
then [[drives]{.underline}]{.mark} the [subsequent [development]{.mark}
of said technology, pulling the government-side along with it, [which
means better products]{.mark} and technology all round -- building

Second, [**[we need a sense of urgency]{.mark}** and the means to
accurately assess what others are doing. [Russia and China are committed
to developing **leading-edge military tech**]{.mark}nologies and
fielding "high-tech forces"]{.underline} in part [because they see U.S.
dominance as an existential threat. [They are **highly motivated**. It
is **not clear** the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [is]{.mark}
as sharply motivated, [which creates]{.mark} the potential for
[a]{.mark} focus or [**commitment gap**. Closing]{.mark} any [such gap
is something leadership should pay attention to; otherwise it may take a
**crisis** or a **military failure** to generate the necessary sense of
urgency]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[Innovation IL\-\--Integration Key]{.underline}**

**Integration is key\-\--we need to incorporate all elements of
innovation to outcompete great powers**

Third, [[we need an **integrated**]{.mark} approach. A [**dynamic**
approach to **innovating**]{.mark} for operational [advantage requires
taking account of **all forms** of innovation, determining the
**appropriate mix** for the **types of conflicts**]{.mark} the armed
[forces are likely to engage in]{.mark} and the specific operational
challenges they will need to overcome. [Innovation encompasses]{.mark}
not only **[tech]{.mark}**nology but also operational [**concepts**
and]{.mark} organization/ **[process]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Military
innovation and transformation leaders have long argued against an
overemphasis on technology at the expense of other factors. Typically it
is some combination of technology, concepts, and organization that
provides a basis for breakthroughs. Often we are reminded of this when
an adversary demonstrates it.

High-end regional war is generally the default lens through which we
view requirements for innovation and it may be true that the bulk of
defense innovation will be directed at this problem. But [[the
**spectrum of conflict**]{.mark} also [includes **hybrid
warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline} (a mix of regular and irregular armed
conflict) [and coercive activities short of armed conflict ("political
warfare")]{.underline}---modes of conflict that are not entirely new,
but whose contemporary manifestations are indeed novel and for which the
United States generally seems poorly prepared. [[We **cannot
dismiss**]{.mark} the requirements for [innovation in these aspects of
**great power competition**]{.mark}, not least because [they may lead us
down pathways]{.mark} much [different from]{.mark} those shaped by the
demands of [highend]{.mark} regional [war]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The following matrix may be useful as a very simple way to visualize the
"battlespace" for innovation.

It is worth noting here that political warfare may be somewhat anomalous
when considered as an arena of great power competition. In this domain,
[[the goal of the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark}
its **[partners]{.mark}** is]{.underline} not to out-innovate
adversaries so as to build the more advanced toolkit for political
subversion, social division, economic warfare, and coercion. Rather, the
West's goal is [to greatly [improve the ability of liberal states to
**reduce**]{.mark} their **[vulnerability]{.mark}** to such strategies
[and]{.mark} actively **[resist]{.mark}** them.]{.underline} This is a
somewhat different context for innovation, but an important one given
the strategic stakes.

**[Innovation Impact\-\--China AI]{.underline}**

**China AI competition escalates**

Calum **Chace 20**, co-founder of the Economic Singularity Foundation,
global keynote speaker about AI, MBA, Cranfield University, 6/30/20,
\"Thucydides And The Dragon: Artificial Intelligence And Sino-US
Rivalry\", Forbes,

From Cold War to Code War?

[[The **most dangerous**]{.mark} source of [**conflict** could
be]{.mark} **China**'s determination to catch up with and then surpass
America as the leading developer of **AI**, our most powerful
technology]{.underline}. Some fear that [the Cold War between the two
nuclear superpowers could be followed by [a **Code War** between]{.mark}
its [**two AI superpowers**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Taiwanese venture capitalist Kai-Fu Lee, a former Google and Apple
executive, argues that China will overhaul the US in AI because it has
more hard-working and aggressive entrepreneurs and researchers, and also
because it has a disregard for privacy which allows its researchers to
amass more data. ["If data is the new oil, China is the new Saudi
Arabia",]{.underline} as one critic put it.

It is true that the 9-9-6 work ethic (72 hours a week) makes Chinese
startup scene a highly competitive one. Many Chinese students no longer
want to stay in the US when they finish their degrees in computer
science. They are keen to return home and get rich there.

Do Chinese people care about privacy?

It is also true that China's attitude to privacy distinguishes it from
the US, and even more from Europe. The Social Credit system being
pioneered today has the potential to become a level of government
surveillance that would make Big Brother jealous. This is happening
partly because the communist party wills it so, and resistance is pretty
much impossible for most citizens. It is also partly because corruption
is endemic and severe in China, and levels of trust outside family
networks are low. A system which punishes anti-social behaviour swiftly
and effectively is less resisted in China than it would be elsewhere.

But we should not over-state the extent to which being oblivious to
privacy issues is a killer app. China watcher JJ Ding argues that
Chinese people do care about privacy, and that the government knows it
cannot take their acceptance for granted. [The US tech giants still have
a significant lead in technology and expertise, and they still have
momentum. AI is increasingly a duopoly between China and the US, not an
emerging Chinese hegemony.]{.underline}

The US managed to avoid the utter disaster of full-scale military
confrontation with the Soviet Union, and in many ways its relations with
China are much closer, which should make confrontation less dangerous.
The US economy is less open than those of most developed countries --
trade accounts for 27% of US GDP, compared to 61% for the UK, and 33%
for China. But the US and Chinese economies are far more entwined than
America's ever was with the Soviet Union. GM sells more cars in China
than in the USA and Canada combined, and Apple, Qualcomm and most other
large US companies are similarly exposed.

[Avoiding the splinternet: a role for Europe]{.underline}

Trump's populist attacks on Huawei won't kill it, although they could
certainly curb its growth, and perhaps shrink it for a while. In the
longer run they could easily have the perverse effect of damaging the US
tech sector: [[China may decide]{.mark} that [America is]{.mark} an
inherently **[untrustworthy]{.mark}** partner, and make the very heavy
investments of time and treasure required to wean itself off US
suppliers, and build its own chip industry]{.underline}, for instance.
[They could [lead to **"the splinternet"**]{.mark}**,** a
[fracturing]{.mark} of [the]{.mark} world's [tech]{.mark}nology
[ecosystem]{.mark} into two distinct communities, [which]{.mark} would
[make **global co-op**]{.mark}eration [harder]{.mark}, and
[provoke]{.mark} mutual [**fear**]{.mark} and suspicion.]{.underline}

[[**War**]{.mark} between China and the US (or NATO) [is the
worst]{.mark} possible [outcome]{.mark}, but at this stage it still
looks unlikely. [Both]{.mark} the US and Chinese [governments must walk
a tightrope between]{.mark} pursuing their legitimate grievances on the
one hand, and **[provoking]{.mark}** outright [**hostility** and
**communications breakdown**]{.mark} on the other.]{.underline} This
requires wisdom and diplomatic skills which are not prominently on
display in both Beijing and Washington at the moment.

[[It would help if there were **three AI superpowers**]{.mark}, not just
two]{.underline}. AI is not a race, as there is no finish line, and
unless the internet splinters completely, the advances made by any party
help everyone. [[But at the moment, **Europe** is barely involved.
**That ought to change**]{.mark}, and soon.]{.underline}

**[Innovation Impact\-\--China Quantum]{.underline}**

**China quantum competition escalates**

Arthur **Herman 19**, director of the Hudson Institute\'s Quantum
Alliance Initiative, 11/10/19, \"The Quantum Computing Threat to
American Security\", Wall Street Journal,
https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-quantum-computing-threat-to-american-security-11573411715

Google announced last month that it had achieved **[[\"quantum
supremacy,\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** demonstrating the potential of [a
new kind of computer that can perform certain tasks many orders of
magnitude faster than the most advanced supercomputers.]{.underline}
It\'s [a [**crucial**]{.mark} moment [for **America\'s national
security**, which depends on **winning the race** to]{.mark} do what
quantum computers will do best: [decrypt]{.mark} the vast majority of
existing [public]{.mark}-key encryption [systems]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Google reports that its quantum computer, dubbed Sycamore, solved a
mathematical calculation in 200 seconds that would take a supercomputer
10,000 years. IBM, a quantum competitor, asserted that Google\'s claim
of supremacy is overblown, and that the world\'s most powerful classical
computer, the Summit OLCF-4 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, could have
done the same calculation in 2.5 days---roughly a thousandfold
difference rather than 1.5 trillionfold. Still, [[quantum
computers]{.mark} are no longer science fiction.]{.underline}

To process information, digital computers use bits, essentially switches
that can be either off or on, corresponding with the binary digits, 0
and 1. Quantum computers employ \"qubits,\" which use the probabilistic
nature of quantum physics to represent any combination of 0 and 1
simultaneously, enabling them to encode more complicated data.

Their computing power grows exponentially as the number of qubits
expands. Sycamore\'s 54-qubit chip allowed it to outcompute the best
supercomputer. [A 2,000- to 4,000-qubit quantum computer [would render
most]{.mark} public-key **[encryption]{.mark}** architectures---used for
applications [from **banking**]{.mark} and credit cards [to the]{.mark}
power [**grid**---**obsolete**]{.mark}.]{.underline} They rely on
numbers too big for conventional computers to factorize, but which a
quantum computer could.

[Building quantum computers is a very heavy lift.]{.underline} They
require hugely expensive infrastructure to stabilize the qubits at
temperatures near absolute zero. They also generate high error rates, or
\"quantum noise,\" for which researchers have to compensate. [Developers
are probably years away from the large-scale code-breaking quantum
computer everyone worries about---although once scientists and engineers
start using quantum computers to build the next generation of quantum
computers]{.underline} (since modeling complex systems like themselves
is one of their strengths) [the timeline could quickly
shorten.]{.underline}

[[Beijing]{.mark} is America\'s chief quantum-computing
rival]{.underline}. It spends at least \$2.5 billion a year on
research---more than 10 times what Washington spends---and has a massive
quantum center in Hefei province. [China [aspires to develop the]{.mark}
code-breaking [**\"killer app,\"**]{.mark} which means
[**protecting**]{.mark} U.S. data and networks [from **quantum
intrusion** is]{.mark} a **[vital]{.mark}** security
interest.]{.underline}

Congress enacted the National Quantum Initiative Act late last year,
which commits an additional \$1.25 billion over five years---still a
fraction of China\'s effort. In addition to more money, [the U.S.
needs]{.underline} a three-phase national-security strategy [to protect
and defend American data, networks and infrastructure from future
quantum attack.]{.underline}

First, dramatically increase efforts to develop encryption methods based
on algorithms large and complex enough to foil quantum intrusion. The
National Institute of Standards and Technology is working to set a
comprehensive standard for these quantum-resistant algorithms so they
can be deployed by 2024, but companies in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere
are already building algorithms and other protective tools.

Second, use quantum technology itself to create the \"unhackable\"
networks of the future. The same particles that make quantum computing
possible can provide randomized and unhackable keys for encrypted
transmissions, in the form of quantum random number generators and
quantum key distribution, a method of securing information shared
between two parties. Dismissed as a fantasy a few years ago, quantum
cryptography has spawned companies in the U.S., Switzerland, South Korea
and Australia, which are deploying the first components of a new
quantum-based information-technology infrastructure. Eventually this
will include satellites using quantum keys to transmit encrypted data.

Here again China has moved quickly. It launched the world\'s first
quantum satellite in 2016 and shocked the world by creating a
quantum-encrypted intercontinental video link from space to a
China-Austria study group in Vienna. China has also created a 1,263-mile
ground link between Beijing and Shanghai using quantum-encrypted keys
between relay stations, which offers an ultrasecure network for
transmitting sensitive data, including for China\'s military and
intelligence services.

Third, require that all U.S. data and networks, including future 5G
technology, be made secure from quantum attack while devoting resources
to build [the [**hack-proof** quantum]{.mark} communication
[networks]{.mark} of the future]{.underline}. That [will [**require**
working with]{.mark} America\'s closest **[allies]{.mark}**, several of
which are [making **key breakthroughs**]{.mark} in the same quantum and
postquantum technologies.]{.underline}

[Promoting such cooperation]{.underline} has been a core mission at the
Quantum Alliance Initiative, which convened a consortium of companies
and universities from [the U.S. and allied countries to [develop
**global standards**]{.mark} for quantum random number generators and
quantum key distribution]{.underline} late last year. [But [no one can
do]{.mark} all [this alone]{.mark}]{.underline}, not even Google plus
IBM plus Microsoft and the other big companies working in quantum
computing. Leadership from the federal government is more imperative
than ever. Google\'s breakthrough proves that [the threats, as well as
the opportunities, of quantum technology are real---and that
[**quantum** is]{.mark} poised to become **[the national-security issue
of the 21st century.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

2\. Communication

[[Communication between the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
Russia]{.mark} is [at an all-time low]{.mark} since the end of the Cold
War, [yet]{.mark} it is a [critical]{.mark} element in the framework of
[deterrence]{.mark}, especially [at the sub-conventional level]{.mark},
where the cost of action is low and attribution is difficult. An
effective deterrence strategy [relies on]{.mark} Washington's
re-establishing [consistent communication]{.mark} avenues [with
Moscow]{.mark}. These [avenues]{.mark} must include both strategic and
sustained communication]{.underline}, each of which has formal and
informal components. [Effective communication [allows the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [to employ]{.mark}]{.underline} a dual-pronged deterrent
strategy utilizing [deterrence by [denial and]{.mark} deterrence by
[punishment]{.mark}]{.underline} through focusing its punitive efforts
on key gray zone actions [while [reserving resources for]{.mark} denial
efforts, such as [resiliency and info]{.mark}rmation
[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}.]{.underline} Douglas Lute explains,
["[It's not enough for the U.S. to have]{.mark} these [threats and
believe them]{.mark}; in fact, [that has no deterrent effect. The
critical thing]{.mark} is to [communicate them in a clear, unambiguous,
and consistent way with Russia]{.mark}."]{.underline}261 [U.S. threats
will not be credible if they promise an escalation that Russia is not
likely to believe.]{.underline}262 [[Identifying gray zone activities
that the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will not tolerate and
communicating these limits to Russia bolster]{.mark} the
[cred]{.mark}ibility of the punitive threat assigned to those
actions.]{.underline}

a\. Formal Diplomacy

[[Formal diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark} between the United States and
the Soviet Union, and now Russia, [has been [a stabilizing force]{.mark}
in the bilateral relationship]{.underline} since the Cold War
[and]{.underline}, furthermore, [has contributed to the safety and
security of the international security environment. [Treaties and
c]{.mark}onfidence-[b]{.mark}uilding [m]{.mark}easure[s]{.mark} that
modify behavior [set the standard for how states]{.mark} conduct
business, and [develop trust]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Open Skies
Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and arms control have been
staples of the U.S.--Russian relationship. [While some diplomatic
measures are still in place]{.underline}, or followed even if they have
not been ratified, [the [erosion of formal diplomacy]{.mark} in recent
years has [reduced]{.mark} the [trust]{.mark} and communication between
the United States and Russia, [causing a destabilizing effect on
deterrence]{.mark}, specifically [in the sub-conventional
level.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[To deter Russian gray zone aggression]{.mark}, many subject matter
experts suggest [reinvigorat]{.mark}ing [efforts to extend New
START]{.mark}]{.underline}. The treaty between the United States and
Russia, which entered into force in February 2011, sets "measures for
the further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms."283
[[The treaty also provides c]{.mark}onfidence[b]{.mark}uilding
[m]{.mark}easure[s]{.mark} [that encourage transparency]{.mark} such as
[on-site inspections, data exchanges, notifications]{.mark}, and the
exchange of predicted yearly numbers of ballistic missiles]{.underline}
(both sea and land based).284 Panetta suggests, "[[The U.S.
should]{.mark} not only [reignite interest]{.mark} in extending the New
START treaty, but also [in developing an improved agreement]{.mark} for
the future, one [that]{.mark} possibly [includes]{.mark} the
[cyber]{.mark} domain [and future weapons.]{.mark}"]{.underline}285
Since the dissolution of the INF in 2019, [the bilateral New START is
the last remaining formal arms control measure between the United States
and Russia and is key in keeping formal diplomatic relations
afloat.]{.underline}

A. NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR A DETERRENT STRATEGY

[[A necessary condition for deterrent success]{.mark} that is specific
to the sub-conventional level and the current security environment is a
shift in the deterrence mindset away from zero tolerance of deterrence
failure toward a cumulative deterrence posture that focuses on
maintaining overarching credibility via tailored responses to targeted
gray zone activities when deterrence and denial fail.]{.underline}
Additionally, [for any deterrent strategy to be applied, [the
foundational conditions]{.mark} of deterrence [must be in place]{.mark},
including [communication and diplomacy to provide assurances and
alternate options]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[to an
adversary]{.underline}. Leon Panetta asserts, ["[Communication with
adversaries is imperative]{.mark} to have. It [serves to forward human
relationships]{.mark} that are [critical]{.mark} in the ability [to
create dialogue and keep open lines]{.mark} of
communication."]{.underline}255 Since the end of the Cold War, [[these
conditions]{.mark} have [deteriorated]{.mark} between the United States
and Russia, and [restoring them is essential.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In addition to diplomatic and military communication, [communication
during a crisis is critical]{.mark} in the maintenance of a deterrent
posture. Just after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the United States and the
Soviet Union]{.underline} signed a 1963 memorandum of understanding that
[established a direct link between the two states. The
"[hotline]{.mark},"]{.underline} as it was called, [was "[a
quick]{.mark} communication [link]{.mark} between heads of states . . .
designed [to reduce the danger of an accident, miscalc]{.mark}ulation
[or]{.mark} a [surprise]{.mark} attack]{.underline}."275 The hotline
[was used multiple times throughout history]{.underline} and has since
been transitioned to the Nuclear Risk Reduction Center, where its role
has been expanded to include providing an communication between the
United States and Russia for "the exchange of notifications under
treaties, goodwill notifications, and for emergency communication during
a major fire in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow."276 [Although the hotline
was established to prevent crisis and escalation to nuclear war, it has
proven an effective means of communication during both crisis and
stability between Washington and Moscow.]{.underline} Robert Gates,
former CIA director and defense secretary, stated that [the hotline is a
critical tool "as long as these two sides have submarines roaming the
oceans and missiles pointed at each other]{.underline}."277

[In [today]{.mark}'s context, [where most]{.mark} of the
[conflict]{.mark} between great powers [is]{.mark} conducted [below the
level]{.mark} of conflict [for which the hotline was created]{.mark},
the hotline's [utility can be expanded]{.mark} as a tool [to
re-establish]{.mark} communication [and broaden communication to
include]{.mark} immediate [gray zone issues. Considering the increased
risk of miscalc]{.mark}ulation based on the current lack of
communication [and]{.mark} the [ability for gray zone
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} [to escalate]{.mark}, a crisis [hotline
is]{.mark} a rational and [effective]{.mark} communication avenue that
is [already established and can be immediately utilized to kick-start
communication]{.mark}]{.underline}. The communication can even start
within the parameters of the existing framework of the NRC to encourage
discourse and submit proposals or grievances over the extension of New
START.

[[Despite]{.mark} the [plummeting]{.mark} political [relations]{.mark}
between the United States and Russia, [military communication]{.mark}
has [remained]{.mark}, even if in a limited fashion. Military contact
has served as [a mainstay]{.mark} of communication]{.underline} between
the states since 2014 and the expulsion of many Russian diplomats. [[At
the top levels of]{.mark} military [leadership]{.mark}, the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army General Mark Milley, and the
Russian chief of the General Staff, General Valery Gerasimov, continue a
limited but regular dialogue]{.underline}. Ulrich Kühn argues, ["[NATO
should]{.mark}]{.underline} aim to [[re-establish]{.mark} . . .
[comm]{.mark}unication[s]{.mark} channels with the Russian General Staff
[at the working level]{.mark}]{.underline}."273 [The top-level
interaction is]{.underline} a [positive]{.underline} foothold in
U.S.--Russian communication; [however, [more frequent communication is
needed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Recently, the interaction between the top
levels has increased, including a physical meeting in Switzerland "aimed
at increasing communication between their nations to reduce risks in
conflict areas."274 [[Efforts are in place]{.mark} to improve military
communication [and could be enhanced]{.mark} through the replacement of
the Russian liaison at SHAPE and by]{.underline} acting on Kühn's
suggestion of [re-establishing working-level military communication.
These [improvements]{.mark} to military communication [could set the
framework of positive relations]{.mark} between the states [to usher in
future consistent diplomatic communication]{.mark}, which is crucial for
deterrence.]{.underline}

3\. Diplomacy

Through diplomacy, it is possible for the United States and Russia to
build lasting cooperation through formal agreements, mutual interests,
and established codes of conduct. This section explores both formal and
informal diplomacy followed by a discussion of U.S. and Russian common
interests detailing specific categories in which diplomacy could be
renewed. However, diplomacy must be a first-line option supported by
credible threats of denial and punishment. Anthony Cordesman explains,
"The one thing that you cannot do is use diplomacy as a substitute for
countermeasures."278 It is critical to recognize that [[every effort
spent toward diplomacy]{.mark} can help stabilize U.S.--Russian
relations [at the nuclear and conventional leve]{.mark}l. Improved
stability at these levels [can alleviate tension]{.mark} and reveal
where instability is still present [at the sub-conventional
level.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Washington must operate from a place of strength to affect Putin's
cost--benefit analysis]{.mark} through deterrence by denial, supported
by punishment, [while also giving him a diplomatic
alternative]{.mark}.]{.underline} Brad Roberts explains that during his
time with the Obama administration, [it was clear that "President [Putin
concluded]{.mark} that there was a fundamental [conflict]{.mark} of
interest with the United States, that it [was a zero-sum
game.]{.mark}]{.underline} The U.S. was pursuing interests against
Russia that were simply unacceptable to President Putin, and as such, he
reconceived a relationship of enduring conflict."279 As described in
earlier chapters, [the United States attempted to demonstrate that Putin
had taken too dark a view of American interests and through diplomatic
opportunities sought to pursue mutual interests and pragmatic
cooperation in various areas; however, the efforts failed.]{.underline}
Roberts explains that [[this]{.mark} conflictual relationship [does not
have to be inevitable:]{.mark} "It is a matter of political calculus
emanating from a particular person at a particular
time."]{.underline}280 This would suggest that [to restore diplomatic
cooperation with Russia, [Putin's decision calculus must be]{.mark}
[influenced]{.mark} to convince him that it is in his best
interest.]{.underline}

Cordesman illustrates that ["the U.S. tends to deal with Russia in terms
of the sticks and often does not have a well-defined set of
carrots."]{.underline}281 Cordesman goes on to explain that [a necessary
addition is "offering a well-defined alternative in terms of cooperation
where the U.S. and Russia both benefit."]{.underline}282 [Operating a
deterrent strategy solely on punishment threats is dangerous because,
although it is imperative to signal to Russia that there are penalties
for misbehavior, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must]{.mark} also
[signal assurance for compliance]{.mark}. With established
communication, [diplomacy will]{.mark} facilitate not only that
acceptable alternative but also aspire to [build]{.mark} formal and
informal [agreements that bound]{.mark} sub-conventional conflict[,
decrease]{.mark} the [risk or escalation, and provide insight

[[Even if New START is not extended, discussions]{.mark} over the
treaty's contents [could]{.mark} be used to [spur]{.mark} discussion on
[a]{.mark} new arms control treaty or]{.underline}, at the very least,
[a [broader]{.mark} discussion and [effort toward]{.mark} multilateral
[arms control]{.mark}]{.underline}. Kühn explains that [discussions
about arms control are "particularly important since the strategic
nuclear dialogue between Washington and Moscow effectively petered out
after the New START entered into force]{.underline} in 2011."286 Kühn
suggests, "[Reconvening NATO--Russian talks about military strategy and
nuclear doctrine]{.underline}, which had been ongoing prior to Russia's
annexation of Crimea, [could help [dispel misperceptions and]{.mark}
thus [avoid]{.mark} inadvertent [escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline}"287
[As the timetested formula for risk reduction is deterrence plus
diplomacy]{.underline}, Kühn's suggestion to reconvene [NATO--Russian
communication, combined with U.S.--Russian efforts toward New
START]{.underline} or a similar treaty, [would likely bolster deterrence
of the gray zone.]{.underline}

[These efforts]{.underline} to reinstate formal diplomacy [would
emphasize the U.S. resolve toward diplomacy and simultaneously [signal
to Russia]{.mark} that [the use]{.mark} or threat [of]{.mark} tactical
[nuclear weapons]{.mark} [is not in its interest]{.mark}]{.underline} as
a state.288 By addressing the unacceptable use of tactical nuclear
weapons in the context of arms control, [Washington has a forum to
address the issue while it [reaffirm]{.mark}s [the]{.mark} nuclear
[taboo]{.mark} and communicates to Moscow that any use of a nuclear
weapon will be met with grave U.S. and international consequences. This
reaffirmation of non-use [drives]{.mark} the U.S.--Russian
[conflict]{.mark} back [to the sub-conventional level]{.mark}, [allowing
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to focus]{.mark} resources and
diplomacy efforts [on the gray zone.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In a situation where the United States and Russia do not extend New
START, formal [diplomacy could be achieved through]{.mark} a
[unilateral]{.mark} approach. To show [commitment]{.mark} and a
willingness for diplomacy, the United States could make a public
commitment to data exchanges and inspections in line with what would
have occurred if New START had been extended. The United States could
also make a public commitment to maintaining the [limited]{.mark} number
of [weapons designated by New START.]{.mark} These commitments [would
foster an environment ripe for]{.mark} continued formal negotiations of
[a future]{.mark} arms [agreement]{.mark} between the United States and
Russia as well as open the path to informal diplomacy between the
states.]{.underline}

The Limited Escalation Risks of Cyber Operations

But all of this [[focus on cyber op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} causing
nuclear escalation may be]{.underline}
**[[misplaced]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, more
importantly, **[[distract policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the
dangers of a more plausible scenario: the use of ambiguous cyber signals
during nuclear crises. Specifically[, [the nature of
cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} [operations **[reduces the]{.mark}ir
[inherent escalatory potential]{.mark}**, particularly when compared to
other ways a state could attack an adversary's nuclear forces or
command, control, and communications systems, like a **direct
counterforce strike**]{.underline} [or employing]{.underline}
**[a]{.underline}**nti-**[sat]{.underline}**ellite
weapon**[s]{.underline}**. But their misuse as a signaling tool could do
more harm than good.

First, [[successfully]{.mark} [conducting]{.mark} [cyber]{.mark}
operations against strategic targets]{.underline}, like nuclear systems,
[[is]{.underline} **[hard]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[er]{.underline}**
[than]{.underline} the [**conventional wisdom might suggest**. It
requires a means of gaining]{.underline} **[access]{.underline}** [to
a]{.underline} **[particular system]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[developing an exploit]{.underline}** to cause a desired effect ---
[and then maintaining **persistent**]{.underline} (and
**[stealthy]{.underline}**) **[access]{.underline}** [to be able to
conduct an offensive operation at the desired **time**]{.underline}.
Moreover, [[the overall]{.underline} **[outcome]{.underline}** [may be
**unpredictable**]{.underline}]{.mark} and net less-than-desirable
results.

Second, [even if a state is]{.underline} **[able]{.underline}** [to
conduct these kinds of operations, they typically
**prefer**]{.underline} [to do so in]{.underline}
**[secret]{.underline}** --- and [this]{.underline}
**[mitigates]{.underline}** some **[escalation concerns]{.underline}**.
That's because, [to cause an escalatory response, a state like Russia
would have to]{.underline} **[uncover]{.underline}** [a cyber operation
during a]{.underline} **[particular time period]{.underline}** --- such
as while the Ukraine conflict is unfolding. For example, [Russia would
have to detect a cyber operation against a nuclear command and control
system to cause Putin to **perceive a "window of
vulnerability,"**]{.underline} perhaps assessing that it is part of a
U.S. or NATO counterforce strategy to disable Russia's ability to
retaliate with nuclear weapons. But [the]{.underline}
**[likelihood]{.underline}** [of these circumstances arising
is]{.underline} **[low]{.underline}** [because --- unless a state is
trying to]{.underline} **[signal]{.underline}** with a cyber capability
--- [it will]{.underline} try to **[keep these kinds of]{.underline}**
sensitive [**operations secret**. Therefore, the chances of such an
operation being]{.underline} **[discovered]{.underline}** [at a
particular time period are]{.underline} relatively
**[small]{.underline}**.

Finally, [even if, hypothetically, Russia]{.underline}
**[was]{.underline}** [to discover a cyber operation taking place, the
likelihood of it]{.underline} **[leading to escalation]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} **[low]{.underline}**. This is [due to the]{.underline}
**[virtual nature]{.underline}** [of [cyber]{.mark} "weapons" --- they
**[rarely cause destruction in the physical world]{.mark}**, let alone
permanent damage]{.underline}. For example, even Russia's 2015 cyber
attack against Ukraine's power grid, an important example of a strategic
cyber attack against civilian critical infrastructure, only resulted in
service disruptions for a few hours. During the current conflict,
Russia-linked actors have so far been stymied in using cyber operations
for strategic impact, such as the failed cyber attack by the group
Sandworm against Ukraine's power grid.

Taken together, this reasoning suggests that, [in]{.underline}
[**practice**, cyber operations may not rise to a level that would cause
a state like Russia to actually fear the **integrity** of its nuclear
command, control, and communications systems, creating **few reasons**
to escalate to the level of nuclear **employment**]{.underline}.

The Flipside of Deterrence by Punishment -- the Fear of Escalation

[[One]{.mark} of the]{.underline} greatest [**[reservation]{.mark}**s
against communicating a willingness to take punitive actions
[concerns]{.mark} the [risk of **escalation**]{.mark} and increased
tension due to a more assertive]{.underline} or offensive [posture.
[Yet]{.mark} when looking into possible responses -- retaliation [in
**cyber**]{.mark}space, for example -- a number of [**"self-dampening"
mechanisms** appear]{.mark} to be **[in place]{.mark}** that may be
**applicable** to many types of responses]{.underline}.30 [[One]{.mark}
example [is]{.mark} the requirement to establish]{.underline} some level
of **[[attribution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of aggression on which to base
a response. As discussed above, while attribution is rarely impossible,
[it can be a time-consuming and technically-challenging endeavor. In a
high-stakes scenario the **time** taken]{.underline} to get attribution
as right as possible [means [there will be **plenty of time** to **think
twice**]{.mark} about actions and consequences, [and]{.mark} to **[lean
on diplomatic measures]{.mark}** in **parallel**. [An example]{.mark} of
a self-dampening mechanism [related to]{.mark} the **[cyber]{.mark}**
domain [is]{.mark} the **[large investment]{.mark}** required to develop
credible offensive capabilities. Moreover, an offensive cyber capability
is a **transitory tool**]{.underline}31. [The ability to access a
computer system or network to cause harm or damage is **only temporary**
and **dependent** on a **very rapid and ongoing patching** of
vulnerabilities]{.underline}. At the same time, wielding the cyber
instrument despite the downside of "burning" the capacity might have a
de-escalatory effect by communicating capability and credibility to the
opponent with a view to discouraging future hostile attacks.
[[Targeting]{.mark} in any domain]{.underline} -- including cyberspace
-- [[must]{.mark} also [follow]{.mark} **relevant
[rules]{.mark}**]{.underline}, law and due-process [[which]{.mark} will
**[self-limit]{.mark}** the **range** of **[targets]{.mark}** and
**actions** available.]{.underline}

[[A]{.mark} final [**"escalatory showstopper"** is]{.mark} related to
the challenge of **identifying** and **developing targets** of adequate
strategic significance -- **not too much, not too little** -- to achieve
the desired effect. Responding to hybrid aggression by applying "middle
range" punitive [actions]{.mark} that are **[proportionate]{.mark}** to
the aggression threatened or suffered [will]{.mark} also
**[self-limit]{.mark}** the escalatory potential. [It is
**unlikely**]{.mark} to be [in the **interest** of **any**]{.mark}
hybrid aggressor [to pursue **a**]{.mark}n **escalatory
[spiral]{.mark}** above and beyond where they were looking to compete in
the first place: on the hybrid level]{.underline}. Nevertheless, one way
to mitigate the risk of escalation -- while enhancing civilian oversight
and interagency coordination -- would be to establish rules of
engagement for punitive actions on the hybrid level32 . This would
provide decision-makers with common guidelines to pursue punitive
actions that fall below the "use of force threshold". Moreover, this
could actually bolster the credibility of punitive actions by signaling
to hybrid aggressors the intent to take pre-prepared punitive actions
when deemed necessary: in other words, a "playbook" for countering
hybrid threats.

[In a world of rapid socio-technical transformation and increasing
fragmentation of political power and authority, cyber security has
firmly established itself as one of the]{.underline} **[top national
security issues]{.underline}** of the 21st century. [Managing cyber
insecurities will]{.underline} most [likely]{.underline} **[further
increase]{.underline}** in **[complexity]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[political significance]{.underline}** [in the next
decade]{.underline}, co-produced by an acceleration of the ongoing
socio-technical transformations, on the one hand, and the changing
dynamics of the related political responses, on the other. The first
part of the book recorded the ongoing geographic expansion of cyberspace
into outer space, anticipated how emerging technologies will increase
the interconnectedness of infrastructures and services, and projected
how in a context of ever tighter coupled and integrated socio-technical
systems cyber threat narratives will inevitably expand to more policy
fields at both the national and international levels. The second part of
the book discussed how in cyberspace state actors need to find the right
balance between restraint and exploitation, why they need to uphold
their efforts to control the risk of escalation, and why governments
increasingly share responsibility with actors from economy and society.

The current state of cyber security politics is very much a reflection
of the interplay between the underlying forces of great power
competition and the dynamics of socio-technical and socio-economic
globalization processes. From the interplay of these two processes
emerge the two key factors -- multidimensional uncertainty and
socio-political ambiguity -- that characterize the current context of
cyber security politics at both the national and international levels,
as highlighted in Figure 16.1. Multidimensional uncertainty plays a key
role in the emergence of cyber insecurity as a wicked problem and shapes
-- and is shaped by -- the ambiguity of cyber security politics.

The ambiguity of cyber security politics encompasses the two dimensions
of cyber security outlined in the introductory chapter (Dunn Cavelty and
Wenger 2022): First, the international dimension of cyber security
politics concentrates on how state actors shape and use cyberspace in
accordance with their strategic goals, while at the same time struggling
to uphold the stability of their strategic relationships. In Figure
16.1, the interactive search for an acceptable balance between

\[FIGURE 16.1 OMITTED\]

the strategic utility of and the strategic stability in cyberspace is
represented in the upper left (possibilities of (geo)political (mis)use)
and lower right (conflictive / cooperative government responses)
corners. Second, the broader dimension of cyber security politics
focuses on how state, industry, and societies negotiate their respective
roles in governing cyberspace, while at the same time competing in the
tech innovation process that affects the continued transformation of
cyberspace. In Figure 16.1, the interactive search for norms of
responsible behavior in an uncertain and ambiguous socio-technical and
sociopolitical context is represented in the lower left (fragmented
trans-sectoral/transnational governance responses) and upper right
(emerging digital technologies) corners.

This concluding chapter, building on the individual contributions to
this book, highlights four key debates that together encapsulate the
complexities and paradoxes of the current thinking about the future of
cyber security politics from a Western perspective. The first section
asks how much political influence states can achieve via cyber
operations and what context factors condition the (limited) strategic
utility of such operations. A second section discusses the role of
emerging digital technologies in cyber security politics and notes how
the dynamics of the tech innovation process reinforce the fragmentation
of the governance space around them. A third section asks how states
attempt to uphold stability in cyberspace, and in their strategic
relations more general, highlighting three interconnected challenges --
escalation, deterrence, and intelligence -- of this interactive quest. A
fourth and final section focuses on the shared responsibility of state,
economy, and society for cyber security and calls attention to the
continuing renegotiation processes about their respective roles in an
increasingly trans-sectoral and transnational governance space.

The strategic utility of cyber operations

The debate about the strategic utility of cyber operations arises in a
context characterized by the interplay between the rapid emergence of
new digital technologies and the politics of their use and misuse. Over
time, [the debate **evolved considerably**, as cyber]{.underline}
[security issues transformed from]{.underline} a **[technical risk
management issue]{.underline}** [discussed by]{.underline} a
**[limited]{.underline}** circle of **[experts]{.underline}** [into a
**key challenge of national security**]{.underline} [debated at
the]{.underline} **[highest level]{.underline}** of governments (Dunn
Cavelty 2008; Dewar 2018). [In its early stages, the debate focused on
**"doomsday"**]{.underline} [cyberattack scenarios that centered on the
**strategic exploitation**]{.underline} [of increasingly interconnected
and vulnerable infrastructures]{.underline} (Clarke and Knake 2010). [As
**out-of-the-blue cyber war**]{.underline} [failed to make
its]{.underline} [**expected appearance**, experts began to
shift]{.underline} their [attention to]{.underline} the political and
strategic implications of **[low-level]{.underline}** cyber
[conflict]{.underline} (Baezner 2018; see also Rid 2012; Lindsay
2014/15), on the one hand, and to the increase of computer network
attack campaigns linked to covert state involvement (Dunn Cavelty 2015),
on the other.

[At the current point]{.underline} in time in the history of cyber
security politics [the]{.underline} **[empirical]{.underline}** [picture
is characterized]{.underline} [by]{.underline} **["dogs that did not
bark"]{.underline}** [at the]{.underline} **[high end]{.underline}** [of
conflict and]{.underline} **[persistent cyber operations]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[instability]{.underline}** [at the]{.underline}
**[low end]{.underline}** of conflict (Schulze 2020; Harknett and Smeets
2020; Lupovici 2021). Within this context, the chapters in this volume
point to three interconnected aspects of the enduring debate about the
strategic utility of cyber operations: A first subsection concentrates
on the difficulty of achieving a controlled strategic effect under
multidimensional uncertainty. The focus here is on explaining why most
cyber operations so far seem not very escalatory and appear unlikely to
result in visible changes in the existing balance of power between great
powers. A second subsection focuses on the utility of cyber operations
as a tool of subversion and mild sabotage. Here the focus is on
understanding how the ambiguity of involved actors and the opaqueness of
cyber operations can be manipulated in specific strategic contexts by
some powers for asymmetric influence. A third subsection deals with the
assumed asymmetrical vulnerability of democracies to disinformation as
the latest cyber threat focus in Western (security) politics. Here the
debate centers on the question if a strategic effect can be achieved via
cyber influence operations that aim at undermining social cohesion and
trust in democratic political institutions.

The power to subvert: manipulating "gray zones" while minimizing the
risk of escalation

[Most cyber operations take place **below the threshold of
war**]{.underline}, Marie Baezner and Sean Cordey (2022) note in their
chapter. Mapping the practical use of such operations in a series of
cyber conflict case studies, they confirm that especially influence
operations fall into a zone which goes beyond conventional diplomacy and
stops short of conventional war, which Lucas Kello describes as
"unpeace" (Kello 2017). Taking this empirical puzzle as a starting point
for their analysis, the chapter asks why some actors see such operations
as attractive and efficient tools of power projection and influence.
[The]{.underline} ([limited]{.underline}) [strategic utility of
cyber]{.underline} (influence) [operations]{.underline}, the two authors
conclude, [**depends** on the characteristics of the **strategic
context** and the **operational environment**]{.underline} in which they
are employed and on the nature of the strategic actor employing such
operations.

[At a **strategic** level, the increasingly pervasive use of
cyber]{.underline} (influence) [operations in international affairs
reflects the current dynamics of great power competition]{.underline}.
Together, the [increasing costs of **conventional** war and the
realities of economic interdependence create incentives, especially for
**great powers**, to gain **asymmetric influence** through cyber
operations, in particular in their spheres of interest,
without]{.underline} however [unduly undermining the **strategic
stability** of great power relations. At an **operational** level, the
use of **cyber influence op**]{.underline}eration[**s** reflects an
operational environment that is characterized by **legal ambiguity** and
**political contestation**, **opacity** of the **parties** involved and
blurred boundaries between the private and public domains. Referring to
the concept of and literature on "gray zones",]{.underline} Baezner and
Cordey argue that [revisionist powers use cyber operations as tools to
operate **below the threshold of armed combat** to gain an asymmetric
advantage in their relationship with other political actors, especially
in view of the global]{.underline} (military) [dominance of the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.

Based on a series of case studies, Baezner and Cordey note that the
following operational assumptions about cyber (influence) operations
seem to make them attractive tools for many to intervene in gray zone
conflicts. First, the majority of the cyber technologies used in such
contexts are widely available at relatively low cost. Patriotic hackers
or opaque criminal groups with ties to domestic or foreign elites use
them opportunistically for disruption and mild sabotage rather than for
destruction. Second, cyber espionage and influence operations are
increasingly used to influence the information environment of a conflict
and gain an asymmetric advantage. They work in tandem with a wider set
of economic, political, and military coercive tools. Third,
[the]{.underline} **[legal uncertainty]{.underline}** [surrounding
intelligence operations allows state actors to **avoid formal
condemnation**]{.underline} [and uphold a posture of]{.underline}
[**plausible deniability**. The opaqueness of actors and operations
makes it unlikely that a **verdict of attribution**]{.underline} [would
be]{.underline} as **[transparent]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[credible]{.underline}** as to justify a military response.

**It [doesn't]{.underline} spill [out]{.underline} to cross-domain
[kinetic]{.underline} force AND is [limited]{.underline} to
[just]{.underline} stop intrusions**

However, [there are **important empirical reasons** to suspect that the
[risks of cyber escalation may be **exaggerated**]{.mark}. Specifically,
if cyberspace is in fact an environment that]{.underline} (perhaps even
more so than others) [generates severe escalation risks, [why
has]{.mark} cyber [escalation **not yet occurred**? Most]{.mark}
interactions between cyber rivals [have been]{.mark} characterized by
**[limited volleys]{.mark}** that have **[not]{.mark} escalated**
[beyond **nuisance levels**]{.mark} and have been largely [**contained**
below]{.mark} the [use-of-force]{.mark} threshold]{.underline}.5 For
example, in [a survey]{.underline} of cyber incidents and responses
between 2000 and 2014, Brandon Valeriano et al. [find that
"[rivals]{.mark}]{.underline} tend to [[respond only to
**lower-level**]{.mark} \[cyber\] [incidents an]{.mark}d the response
tends to **[check]{.mark} the [intrusion]{.mark}** as [opposed to seek
**escalation dominance**]{.mark}. The majority of cyber escalation
episodes are at a **low severity threshold** and are **non-escalatory**.
These incidents are usually **['tit-for- tat']{.mark}** type responses
[**within one step** of the]{.mark} original
[incident]{.mark}."]{.underline}6 [[Even in]{.mark} the **two [rare
examples]{.mark}** in which states [employed kinetic
force]{.mark}]{.underline} in response to adversary cyber
operations---the US counter-ISIL drone campaign in 2015 and Israel's
airstrike against Hamas cyber operatives in 2019---[the use of [force
was **circumscribed**]{.mark} and did **not escalate** the overall
conflict]{.underline} (not to mention that force was used against
nonstate adversaries with limited potential to meaningfully escalate in
response to US or Israeli force).7

We posit that [cyber escalation has not occurred because cyber
operations are **poor tools** of escalation]{.underline}. In particular,
we argue that [this stems from **key characteristics** of **offensive**
cyber capabilities that **limit escalation** through four mechanisms.
First, **[retal]{.mark}**iatory offensive cyber
**[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** may not exist at the **desired
time** of employment. Second, even under conditions where they may
exist, their [effects are **uncertain** and]{.mark} often relatively
**[limited]{.mark}**. Third, several attributes of offensive cyber
operations generate **important tradeoffs** for decision-makers that may
make them hesitant to employ capabilities in some
circumstances.]{.underline} [Finally, the alternative of
[**cross-domain** escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}---responding to a
cyber incident with noncyber, kinetic instruments---[[is
**unlikely**]{.mark} to be chosen except under **rare** circumstances,
[given]{.mark} the **[limited]{.mark} cost-generation
[potential]{.mark}** of offensive cyber operations]{.underline}. In this
article, we define cyber escalation and then explore the implications of
the technical features and requirements for offensive cyber operations.
We also consider potential alternative or critical responses to each of
these logics. Finally, we evaluate the implications for US policy
making.

Stabilising or Not

Dissimulation is an essential part of hybrid warfare, and Europe and the
US face a **[[propaganda]{.underline}]{.mark}** barrage that is much
more sophisticated than the clumsy Soviet efforts of the Cold War.
Despite this clumsiness, [a good portion of the Western public has found
it persuasive]{.underline}. Similarly, [those critical of NATO will find
new complaints about aggression]{.underline} and militarisation
[credible. Russia has already complained that [NATO's]{.mark} defensive
[cyber doctrine is destabilising]{.mark} warmongering]{.underline} and
part of a larger conspiracy to advance western hegemony.11 The Snowden
revelations have lent a powerful impetus to Russian propaganda.

[[Behind the **rhetoric** lies]{.mark} both [a desire to **conceal their
own**]{.mark} use of **[cyber op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} a real **[fear]{.mark}** that [Russia's]{.mark} decline
leaves it [**vulnerable**]{.mark} to new military technologies. [The
intent]{.mark} is to **[hamper]{.mark}** and complicate any **[Western
response]{.mark}** to Russian efforts]{.underline} to regain control in
Crimea and the "near abroad". The Russian position is that NATO's new
cyber doctrine is destabilising as it threatens to use conventional or
even nuclear responses (in the Russian description of the new policy
towards low-level cyber attacks).

[[**Any announcement**]{.mark} by NATO [relating to **offensive
cyber**]{.mark} capabilities [would be greeted with **alarm**]{.mark}
and vitriol in Moscow. [However, the effect on **stability**
would]{.mark} likely [be **less pronounced**]{.mark}. NATO-Russia
relations are already in steep decline. It is possible that any NATO
announcement would accelerate this, but it is also possible that [Russia
could **recalculate**]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark} of further adventures
[if]{.mark} it were [faced with a **stronger
defence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In terms of opponent attitudes, there is
probably little effect. Russia, along with NATO's other potential
military opponents, is likely to overestimate both capabilities and
coordination among NATO member states and underestimate NATO's will to
defend. This is an unhappy combination as it makes aggression against
NATO seem less risky.

[[NATO's decision]{.mark} on how [**cyber attacks could trigger Article
5**,]{.mark} while greeted with complaints, [had a **stabilising
effect**.]{.mark} It made clear to potential opponents that [cyber
attacks are **not risk-free**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Similarly, [a clear
enunciation of how [NATO]{.mark} would use [offensive cyber]{.mark}
capabilities]{.underline} as part of any defensive operation
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[change opponents' risk
calc]{.mark}**ulations in ways that would force them to consider how
offensive actions]{.underline}, even if intended to be covert, [are not
free of risk or cost.]{.underline}

**Russia won't launch catastrophic cyber attacks**

James Andrew **Lewis 20**, Senior Vice President and Director of the
Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, "Dismissing Cyber Catastrophe", Center for Strategic and
International Studies, 8/17/2020,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/dismissing-cyber-catastrophe

A catastrophic cyberattack was first predicted in the mid-1990s. Since
then, predictions of a catastrophe have appeared regularly and have
entered the popular consciousness. As a trope, [a [cyber
catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline} captures our imagination, but as
analysis, it [[remains **entirely imaginary**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
is of dubious value as a basis for policymaking. There has never been a
catastrophic cyberattack.

To qualify as a catastrophe, an event must produce damaging mass effect,
including casualties and destruction. The fires that swept across
California last summer were a catastrophe. Covid-19 has been a
catastrophe, especially in countries with inadequate responses. With
man-made actions, however, a catastrophe is harder to produce than it
may seem, and for cyberattacks a catastrophe requires organizational and
technical skills most actors still do not possess. It requires planning,
reconnaissance to find vulnerabilities, and then acquiring or building
attack tools---things that require resources and experience. [To achieve
mass effect]{.underline}, either [a few]{.underline} central [targets
(like an electrical grid) need to be hit]{.underline} or multiple
targets would have to be hit simultaneously (as is the case with urban
water systems), something that is itself an operational challenge.

[It is easier to imagine a catastrophe than to produce it. The
20**[03]{.mark}**]{.underline} East Coast [[blackout is the
archetype]{.mark} for an attack on the]{.underline} U.S. electrical
[grid. **[No one died]{.mark}**]{.underline} in this blackout, [and
[services]{.mark} were [**restored** in]{.mark} a **few [days]{.mark}**.
As electric production is digitized, vulnerability increases, but many
electrical [companies]{.mark} have [made]{.mark}
**cybers[ecurity]{.mark}** [a **priority**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Similarly, at water treatment plants, the chemicals used to purify water
are controlled in ways that make mass releases difficult. In any case,
it would take a massive amount of chemicals to poison large rivers or
lakes, more than most companies keep on hand, and any release would
quickly be diluted.

More importantly, [[there are **powerful strategic constraints**]{.mark}
on those who have the ability to launch catastrophe
attacks]{.underline}. We have more than two decades of experience with
the use of cyber techniques and operations for coercive and criminal
purposes and have a clear understanding of motives, capabilities, and
intentions. We can be guided by the methods of the Strategic Bombing
Survey, which used interviews and observation (rather than hypotheses)
to determine effect. These methods apply equally to cyberattacks. The
conclusions we can draw from this are:

- Nonstate actors and most states lack the capability to launch attacks
  that cause physical damage at any level, much less a catastrophe.
  There have been regular predictions every year for over a decade that
  nonstate actors will acquire these high-end cyber capabilities in two
  or three years in what has become a cycle of repetition. The monetary
  return is negligible, which dissuades the skilled cybercriminals
  (mostly Russian speaking) who might have the necessary skills. One
  mystery is why these groups have not been used as mercenaries, and
  this may reflect either a degree of control by [the
  **[Russia]{.mark}**n state]{.underline} (if it [[has
  **forbidden**]{.mark} mercenary [acts]{.mark}]{.underline}) or a
  degree of caution by criminals.

- [[There is **enough uncertainty**]{.mark} among potential attackers
  [about]{.mark} the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates'
  [[ability to **attribute**]{.mark} that [they are **unwilling** to
  risk **massive retal**]{.mark}iation in response to a catastrophic
  attack]{.underline}. (They are perfectly willing to take the risk of
  attribution for espionage and coercive cyber actions.)

- [**No one has ever died** from a cyberattack, and **only a handful**
  of these attacks have produced **physical** damage]{.underline}. A
  cyberattack is not a nuclear weapon, and it is intellectually lazy to
  equate them to nuclear weapons. Using a tactical nuclear weapon
  against an urban center would produce several hundred thousand
  casualties, while a strategic nuclear exchange would cause tens of
  millions of casualties and immense physical destruction. These are
  catastrophes that some hack cannot duplicate. The shadow of nuclear
  war distorts discussion of cyber warfare.

- [[State use]{.mark} of cyber operations is consistent with their
  **broad** national strategies and interests. Their primary emphasis
  [is]{.mark} on [**espionage** and]{.mark} **political
  [coercion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The United States has
  [opponents]{.underline} and is in conflict with them, but they [have
  **[no]{.mark} interest** in launching a **[catastrophic]{.mark}**
  cyber**[attack]{.mark}** since it would certainly produce an equally
  **catastrophic retaliation**. Their [**goal** is]{.mark} to stay
  **[below]{.mark} the ["use-of-force"]{.mark} threshold** and undertake
  damaging cyber actions against the **U**]{.underline}nited
  **[S]{.underline}**tates, [[**not** start]{.mark} a
  **[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This has implications for the discussion of [[**inadvertent**
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}, something that [has]{.underline} also
[[**never** occurred]{.underline}]{.mark}. The concern over escalation
deserves a longer discussion, as there are both technological and
strategic constraints that shape and limit risk in cyber operations, and
[the [absence]{.mark} of inadvertent escalation [suggests]{.mark} a
**[high]{.mark} degree of [control]{.mark}** for cyber capabilities by
advanced states. Attackers]{.underline}, particularly among the United
States' major opponents for whom cyber is just one of the tools for
confrontation, seek to [**avoid** actions that could trigger
escalation]{.underline}.

The United States has two opponents (China and [Russia]{.underline}) who
[are capable of damaging cyberattacks. Russia has demonstrated its
attack skills on the Ukrainian power grid, but [**neither Russia nor
China would be well served** by a]{.mark} similar [attack]{.mark} on the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. Iran is improving and
may reach the point where it could use cyberattacks to cause major
damage, but it would only do so when it has decided to engage in a major
armed conflict with the United States. Iran might attack targets outside
the United States and its allies with less risk and continues to
experiment with cyberattacks against Israeli critical infrastructure.
North Korea has not yet developed this kind of capability.

One major failing of [catastrophe [scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline} is
that they [[discount]{.mark} the **robustness** and
**[resilience]{.mark}** of modern economies. These economies present
[**multiple** targets]{.mark} and configurations; they [are **harder to
damage**]{.mark} through cyberattack than they look, given the
growing]{.underline} (albeit incomplete) [attention to cybersecurity;
and experience shows that [people **compensate**]{.mark} for damage [and
**quickly repair**]{.mark} or rebuild]{.underline}. This was one of the
counterintuitive lessons of the Strategic Bombing Survey. Pre-war
planning assumed that civilian morale and production would crumple under
aerial bombardment. In fact, the opposite occurred. Resistance hardened
and production was restored.1

This is a short overview of why [catastrophe is
**unlikely**]{.underline}. Several longer CSIS reports go into the
reasons in some detail. Past performance may not necessarily predict the
future, but after 25 years without a single catastrophic cyberattack, we
should invoke the concept cautiously, if at all. Why then, it is raised
so often?

**Everything is [small]{.underline}, [designed]{.underline} to avoid
miscalc**

the United States of America and Russia"

On the other hand, [[both]{.mark} states [might not desire]{.mark}
further [escalation]{.mark}, preferring to restrain the conflict to
cyberspace]{.underline}. [Each would follow the "tit-for-tat" logic and
accuse each other]{.underline} **[while [never reaching]{.mark} a
tipping point where the conflict spills over to a [conventional
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Such a tipping point would be linked to the
intensity of the attack or the nature of the targets. [Both [nations
would keep]{.mark} the [cyberattacks **small**]{.mark} enough not to
trigger a bigger reaction. The same would be observed on the choice of
targets, with both avoiding certain critical or sensitive targets, for
instance critical infrastructures.]{.underline} In order to contain the
conflict in cyberspace, both states would have **[[to
demonstrate]{.mark} their [restraint by selecting options with
low]{.mark} risk of [miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}** (Lin, 2012,
pp. 64--66). In the future, [[it might]{.mark} also be possible to
[see]{.mark} a [deescalation in]{.mark} the form of the emergence of an
international treaty or at least further [**bilateral treaties**
between]{.mark} the [USA and Russia]{.mark} on
cyberattacks]{.underline}. For example, during the last few years,
businesses in the USA were often hacked and spied on by the Chinese
military. These intrusions were mostly cyber-economic-espionage and were
said to have supported the theft of billions of dollars' worth of
intellectual property (Bamford, 2016). [In]{.underline} September [2015,
the USA and China signed an agreement engaging both countries not to
support or conduct cyber-theft of intellectual property]{.underline}.
Moreover, the parties have made the commitment not to use cyberattacks
against each other's critical infrastructures in peace-time and to
support the establishment of international behavioral norms in
cyberspace (Rosenfeld, 2015). [Both states also highlighted the fact
that they could not control each individual in their country and
therefore could not be held responsible for individual
acts.]{.underline} Since then it seems that the number of attacks on
commercial targets has diminished (Timm, 2016). Former President Obama
suggested the creation of a position of cybersecurity ambassador to deal
with bilateral or multilateral treaties concerning cyber-norms (Lee,
2016). For this kind of de-escalation to take effect, the termination of
the conflict at hand must be the stated aim of both parties. A clear
common understanding of the terms of agreement is required and must be
based on trust-building efforts, as well as the assurance of mutual
adherence. The difficulty of tracking the implementation of such
agreements in cyberspace has been an obstacle preventing more states
consenting to such solutions (Lin, 2012, pp. 62--64). Nevertheless, **[a
[dialogue on cyberspace already exists]{.mark} between the USA and
Russia]{.underline}** since July 2013. This **[[cooperation
includes]{.underline}]{.mark}** Confidence Building Measures
(**[[CBM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [such as the creation of working groups
on the issue of ICT security, exchange of information between the two
national]{.underline} Computer Emergency Response Teams
([[CERT]{.underline}), **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the creation of
a [direct communication]{.mark} line [to]{.mark} directly
[manage]{.mark} ICT [incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Segal, 2016; The
White House, Office of the Press Secretary, 2013). In October 2016,
former President Obama used the latter to inform Russian President Putin
that the USA was accusing Russia of interference in the election process
(Ignatius, 2016). Furthermore, Russia and the USA take part in the UN
GGE supporting the future establishment of international norms on
actions in cyberspace. [They stated that international law can be
applied in cyberspace and therefore, the rules of proportionality and
limited collateral damage should also be respected in
cyberattacks]{.underline} (Ignatius, 2016; United Nations General
Assembly, 2015). These examples demonstrate that **[[even though]{.mark}
the two [states are involved]{.mark} in a ["tit-for-tat"]{.mark} logic
in their relations on a tactical level, [there was still]{.mark} a
[dialogue on the strategic level]{.mark}]{.underline}**, at least until
2015. The recent cyberattacks in USA and the election of Donald Trump as
US President, bring new uncertainties.

**They have [zero interest]{.underline} in producing
[widespread]{.underline} damage**

Dr. James Andrew **Lewis 18**, Senior Vice President at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, Ph.D. from the University of
Chicago, January 2018, "Rethinking Cybersecurity: Strategy, Mass Effect,
and States," <https://tinyurl.com/y27xcqbb>, p. 7-11

Similarly, [the popular idea that opponents use cyber techniques to
inflict cumulative economic harm is not supported by evidence. Economic
warfare has always been part of conflict, but [there are no examples
of]{.mark} a country seeking to imperceptibly [harm]{.mark} the economy
of an opponent]{.underline}. The United States engaged in economic
warfare during the Cold War, and still uses sanctions as a tool of
foreign power, but few if any other nations do the same. The intent of
cyber espionage is to gain market or technological advantage. Coercive
actions against government agencies or companies are intended to
intimidate. **[Terrorists do not seek to inflict economic
damage]{.underline}**. [The difficulty of wreaking real harm on large,
interconnected economies is usually ignored]{.underline}.

[Economic warfare in cyberspace is ascribed to China, but]{.underline}
China\'s cyber doctrine has three elements: control of cyberspace to
preserve party rule and political stability, espionage (both commercial
and military), and preparation for disruptive acts to damage an
opponent\'s weapons, military information systems, and command and
control. [\"Strategic\" uses, such as striking civilian infrastructure
in the opponent\'s homeland, appear to be a lower priority and are an
adjunct to nuclear strikes as part of China\'s strategic
deterrence.]{.underline} [Chinese officials seem more concerned about
accelerating China\'s growth rather than some long-term effort to
undermine the American economy]{.underline}.6 The 2015 agreement with
the United States served Chinese interests by centralizing tasking
authority in Beijing and ending People\'s Liberation Army (PLA)
\"freelancing\" against commercial targets.

[The Russians specialize in coercion, financial crime, and creating
harmful cognitive effect]{.underline}---the ability to manipulate
emotions and decisionmaking. Under their 2010 military doctrine on
disruptive information operations (part of what they call \"New
Generation Warfare\"). [**[Russians want confusion, not]{.mark} physical
[damage]{.mark}**. Iran and **No**rth **Ko**rea use cyber actions
against American banks or entertainment companies like Sony or the Sands
Casino, but their goal is political coercion, not
destruction.]{.underline}

[None of these countries talk about death by 1000 cuts or attacking
critical infrastructure]{.underline} to produce a cyber Pearl Harbor or
any of the other scenarios that dominate the media. The few disruptive
attacks on critical infrastructure have focused almost exclusively on
the energy sector. [Major financial institutions face a high degree of
risk but in most cases, the attackers\' intent is to extract
money]{.underline}. [There have been cases of service disruption and
data erasure, but these have been **limited** in scope.
Denial-of-service attacks against banks impede services and may be
costly to the targeted bank, but **do not have a major effect on the
national economy**]{.underline}. In all of these actions, **[there is a
line that countries have been unwilling to cross.]{.underline}**

[When our [opponents]{.mark} decided to challenge American \"hegemony,\"
they developed [strategies]{.mark} to [circumvent]{.mark} the risks of
**[retal]{.mark}**iation or escalation [by ensuring]{.mark} that their
[actions stayed below]{.mark} the [use-of-force
threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}---an imprecise threshold, roughly defined
by international law, but usually considered to involve actions that
produce destruction or casualties. [**Almost [all cyber attacks fall
below this]{.mark} threshold, including, crime, espionage, and
politically coercive acts**. This explains why the decades-long quest to
rebuild Cold War deterrence in cyberspace has been
fruitless.]{.underline}

[It also explains why we have not seen the dreaded cyber Pearl Harbor or
other predicted catastrophes.]{.underline} [Opponents are keenly aware
that launching catastrophe brings with it immense risk of receiving
catastrophe in return]{.underline}. [States are the only actors who can
carry out catastrophic cyber attacks and they are **very unlikely** to
do so in a strategic environment that seeks to gain advantage without
engaging in armed conflict]{.underline}. Decisions on targets and attack
make sense only when embedded in their larger strategic calculations
regarding how best to fight with the United States.

[There have been thousands of incidents of cybercrime and cyber
espionage, but only a **handful** of true attacks, where the intent was
not to extract information or money, but to disrupt and, in a few cases,
destroy.]{.underline} From these incidents, we can extract a more
accurate picture of risk. The salient incidents are the cyber operations
against Iran\'s nuclear weapons facility (Stuxnet), Iran\'s actions
against Aramco and leading American banks, North Korean interference
with Sony and with South Korean banks and television stations, and
Russian actions against Estonia, Ukrainian power facilities, Canal 5
(television network in France), and the 2016 U S. presidential
elections. **[Cyber attacks are not random]{.underline}**. [All of these
incidents have been part of larger geopolitical conflicts]{.underline}
involving Iran, Korea, and the Ukraine, or Russia\'s contest with the
United States and NATO.

[There are commonalities in each attack. All were undertaken by state
actors or proxy forces to achieve the attacking state\'s policy
objectives]{.underline}. **[Only two caused tangible
damage]{.underline}**; the rest created coercive effect, intended to
create confusion and psychological pressure through fear, uncertainty,
and embarrassment. **[In no instance were there deaths or
casualties]{.underline}**. [**[In two decades of cyber attacks, there
has never been a]{.mark} single [casualty]{.mark}**. This alone should
give pause to the doomsayers]{.underline}. **[[Nor]{.mark} has there
been widespread [collateral damage]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[No Russian Cyber\-\--AT: Ukraine]{.underline}**

**They're not using cyberattacks in Ukraine**

Enterprise Institute, "Where is Russia's cyber blitzkrieg?," The Hill,
3/9/22,
<https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/597272-where-is-russias-cyber-blitzkrieg/>

[Fighting in Ukraine continues **but the much-anticipated Russian cyber
blitzkrieg hasn't occurred**. Russian forces have]{.underline}
**[failed]{.underline}** [to deploy devastating cyber attacks in
the]{.underline} [**opening salvo**, despite]{.underline} **[ample
opportunity]{.underline}** [to cripple Ukrainian networks. Where is the
**dramatic, game-changing cyber war we were promised?** Pundits are
scrambling for explanations. Spoiler alert: Cyber isn't a magic wand to
wave and gain battlefield superiority. Cyber attacks are rarely decisive
on their own, and they don't exist in a vacuum. Strategic context is
critical]{.underline} for unpacking the use of cyber operations, and
[Russia's invasion strategy]{.underline} [undeniably]{.underline} has
shaped and **[restricted]{.underline}** [its menu of cyber
options]{.underline}.

First, [the Kremlin's goal of **regime change in Kyiv**]{.underline}
[means]{.underline} that Russian [cyber operations are **subject to the
"you break it, you buy it" rule**. If your plan is to install a
**puppet**]{.underline} government, [the]{.underline} **[last thing you
want]{.underline}** to do [is]{.underline} **[obliterate]{.underline}**
Ukraine's communications networks and other critical
[**infrastructure**. Life would]{.underline} [be]{.underline}
**[miserable]{.underline}** for any regime trying to manage a population
with no electricity or water. [Now add]{.underline} an extra layer of
**[Ukrainian outrage]{.underline}** against a Russian lackey whom they
likely would violently oppose. As a result, the Russians have launched
limited attacks to temporarily disrupt public services. This has
included website vandalism, overloading government servers with traffic,
and using malware to wipe data from banking networks.

[Putin's]{.underline} **[overconfidence]{.underline}** in a swift and
overwhelming victory [is another reason]{.underline} for the lack of
cyber-induced damage. In thinking that this would be a quick
smash-and-grab, the Kremlin de facto shelved what could have been its
most powerful cyber capabilities. High-impact cyber attacks require
immense resources, planning time, and operational control so that they
hit their mark and aren't discovered before pulling the trigger. Meeting
these conditions is extremely hard, and it's not worth the effort if you
expect a quick win. Disruption therefore takes a backseat to
intelligence collection. While tracking targets on Ukrainian networks is
valuable, taking them offline is counterproductive. Putin's months-long
military buildup gave time to plan for high-end cyber warfare. That we
haven't seen it is a testament to false assumptions of quick victory and
an underestimation of Ukrainian cyber defense.

[Finally]{.underline}, the Russian military's **[poor
planning]{.underline}** and execution [in]{.underline} the early stages
of **[invasion]{.underline}** [cast]{.underline} **[doubt]{.underline}**
[on]{.underline} its [ability]{.underline} [to]{.underline} truly
**[integrate]{.underline}** [cyber with conventional operations in
combat]{.underline}. As I've written, this is a challenge for many
militaries. It is particularly true for Russia, where the military and
intelligence cyber-ecosystem is crowded with units that constantly
compete and lack coordination. But incorporating cyber effects into
kinetic operations is even harder for a military whose soldiers don't
know where they are or why they're deployed. Their reliance on civilian
radios and mobile phones for communication doesn't inspire much
confidence either.

[The Russians clearly excel in cyber **espionage**]{.underline}: By
hacking one company (SolarWinds) and corrupting a single software
product, Russian cyber operators gained access to several Fortune 500
companies and U.S. government agencies. [However, given the]{.underline}
**[lack of impact]{.underline}** in the past and current logistical
struggles, [we should]{.underline} **[temper our expectations about
Russian cyber prowess in wartime]{.underline}**.

[The Kremlin]{.underline} [**hasn't gotten the military knockout blow it
wanted, and missed its window of opportunity**. Cyber operations
would]{.underline} **[not have been decisive]{.underline}**. But they
could have enabled a first-mover advantage by taking out Ukraine's
digital eyes and ears, including the ability to receive and integrate
intelligence shared by NATO. This is not to say that cyber has no role
to play moving forward; quite the opposite. The longer the war lasts,
the greater likelihood that Russian forces will test out new tools on
Ukrainian networks. Such activity can manifest as increased intelligence
collection or the use of cyber capabilities at the tactical level to
produce limited, localized effects. Both could contribute to the
lethality of Russia's conventional strikes. For example, tactical cyber
attacks could facilitate a ground unit's ability to secure or destroy a
target by briefly disrupting specific networks within the given area of
operation.

[[It is]{.underline}]{.mark} of course [**[highly unlikely]{.mark}**
that [either]{.mark} the **[US]{.mark}**A [or Russia has plans --
or]{.mark} perhaps more importantly, the [desire --
to]{.mark}]{.underline} fully [[undermine]{.mark} the [other's]{.mark}
nuclear **[c]{.mark}**]{.underline}ommand [[and
**c**]{.underline}]{.mark}ontrol [systems]{.underline} as a precursor to
some type of disarming first strike, but the perception that nuclear
forces and associated systems could be vulnerable or compromised is
persuasive. Or as Hayes (2015) puts it, "The risks of cyber disablement
entering into our nuclear forces are real". While [the [growing
possibility]{.mark} of "[cyber]{.mark} disablement" [should **not** be
**overstated** (notions of a]{.mark} "cyber-**[Pearl
Harbor]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Panetta 2012) [or "cyber
9--11"]{.underline} (Charles 2013) [[have **done little** to help
understand]{.mark} the nature of the challenge]{.underline}),
cyberthreats are nevertheless an increasingly important component of the
contemporary US--Russia strategic context. This is particularly the case
when they are combined with other emerging military-technical
developments and programmes. The net result, especially given the
current downturn in US--Russian strategic relations, and the way cyber
is exacerbating the impact of other problematic strategic dynamics, is
that is seems highly unlikely that either the USA or Russia will make
the requisite moves to de-alert nuclear forces that the new cyber
challenges appear to necessitate, or for that matter to (re)embrace the
"deep nuclear cuts" agenda any time soon.

Assessing the options for arms control and enhancing mutual security

Given the new challenges presented by cyber to both US and Russian
nuclear forces and to US--Russia strategic stability, it is important to
consider what might be done to help mitigate and guard against these
threats, and thereby help minimise the risks of unintentional launches,
miscalculation, and accidents, and perhaps create the conditions for
greater stability, de-alerting, and further nuclear cuts. While there is
unlikely to be a panacea or "magic bullet" that will reduce the risk of
cyberattacks on US and Russian nuclear forces to zero -- be they
designed to launch nuclear weapons or compromise the systems that
support them -- there are a number of options that might be considered
and pursued in order to address these different types of threats and
vulnerabilities. None, of these however, will be easy.

The most obvious and immediate priority for both the USA and Russia is
working (potentially together) to harden and better protect nuclear
systems against possible cyberattack, intrusion, or cyber-induced
accidents. In fact, in October 2013 it was announced that Russian
nuclear command and control networks would be protected against cyber
incursion and attacks by "special units" of the Strategic Missile Forces
(Russia Today 2014). Other measures will include better network defences
and firewalls, more sophisticated cryptographic codes, upgraded and
better protected communications systems (including cables), extra
redundancy, and better training and screening for the practitioners that
operate these systems (see Ullman 2015). However, and while
comprehensive reviews are underway to assess the vulnerabilities of
current US and Russian nuclear systems to cyberattacks, it may well be
that US and Russian C2 infrastructure becomes more vulnerable to cyber
as it is modernised and old analogue systems are replaced with
increasingly hi-tech digital platforms. As a result, and while
[**[nuclear]{.mark}** weapons [and **c**]{.mark}ommand [and
**c**]{.mark}ontrol [infrastructure are]{.mark} likely to be [the **best
protected** of **all**]{.mark} computer systems, [and **"air
gapped"**]{.mark}]{.underline}14 [[from the]{.mark} wider
[Internet]{.mark}]{.underline} -- this does not mean they are
invulnerable or will continue to be secure in the future, particularly
as systems are modernised or become more complex (Fritz 2009). Or as
Peggy Morse, ICBM systems director at Boeing, put it, "while its old
it's very secure" (quoted in Reed 2012).

C. Todd **Lopez 20**, Reporter at DOD News, "U.S. Seeks to Maintain
Credible Nuclear Deterrent", DOD News, 3/3/2020,

[The **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[maintains a **robust**]{.mark} nuclear [arsenal]{.mark} that [consists
of **ground**]{.mark}-based, **[air]{.mark}**-launched [and
**sea**]{.mark}-launched weapons. Together, it\'s commonly called [the
**\"nuclear triad,\"**]{.mark} and it [**remains** the **centerpiece**
of the]{.mark} U.S. nuclear [deterrent]{.mark}]{.underline}. The triad
is fast approaching the end of its service life and must quickly be
replaced before it\'s lost.

Victorino G. Mercado, currently performing the duties of the assistant
secretary of defense for strategy, plans and capabilities testified
today before the House Armed Services Committee, subcommittee on
strategic forces. He told lawmakers that efforts to replace the triad
are not part of an arms race.

\"The U.S. seeks only what it needs to maintain a credible nuclear
deterrent,\" he said. \"In contrast to Russia, who maintains about 2,000
non-strategic nuclear weapons and are pursuing and fielding other novel
nuclear capabilities, we have no desire or intent to engage in an arms
race nor match weapon-for-weapon the capabilities being fielded by
Russia.\"

The DOD\'s fiscal year 2021 budget request for nuclear forces, Mercado
said, is \$28.9 billion, or 4.1% of the total DOD request. The funding
request to modernize the existing triad is about 1.7% of the budget
request, he added. \"The nation's nuclear modernization program is
affordable,\" he said.

Mercado said that [[after **decades** of **deferred**
recapitalization]{.underline}]{.mark} of the nuclear triad, [the [U.S.
must move ahead with]{.mark} [**modernizing** its]{.mark} nuclear
[forces]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, as defined in the Nuclear
Posture Review, the U.S. must also pursue additional flexibility with
systems like the sea-launched cruise missile, he said, \"to ensure that
there are no gains to be made through the use of any nuclear weapon,
strategic or otherwise.\"

The idea of the nation\'s power grids becoming the next battleground for
cyber warriors could make hacking into consumers' credit card accounts
and personal information seem like child's play. [While U.S. power
companies are likely targeted by foreign governments]{.underline} and
others in increasingly sophisticated breaches, **[actually [shutting
off]{.mark} the lights]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline} **[causing
chaos]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[far more
[complicated]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[than many pundits make it
seem.]{.underline} Dan [Scali]{.underline}, [senior manager of
industrial control systems at Mandiant, a cybersecurity consulting arm
of FireEye
([FEYE](http://www.foxbusiness.com/quote.html?stockTicker=FEYE)),]{.underline}
[explained]{.underline} that [while cyber criminals]{.underline} [may
gain [access]{.mark} to power and utility data systems]{.underline},
[it]{.underline} **[[doesn't]{.underline}]{.mark}** necessarily
**[[mean]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the result will be [a]{.mark} **power
[outage]{.mark}** []{.mark}and a **total takedown** of power grid
control systems.]{.underline} In other words, [the power [grid
is]{.mark} controlled by **[more than just]{.mark} a panel** of digital
[buttons. ]{.mark}]{.underline}["[Losing]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[control]{.mark} system is bad]{.underline} from the perspective that it
takes you out of your normal mode of operations of being able to control
everything from one command center, [but]{.underline} [it [**doesn't**
mean]{.mark} you've lost control or all the **[lights go
out]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[in the city\]," Scali explained. While many
of the systems have been modernized to include digitized control panels,
[if a hacker were to infiltrate the system, [a utility worker could
still]{.mark} have the ability to]{.underline} **[[manually
control]{.mark} the [machines]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}[by]{.underline} **[flipping a switch]{.underline}**, pushing a
button, or tripping a breaker. As the world saw with the recent attack
in Ukraine, which caused a blackout for 80,000 customers of the nation's
western utility, the biggest problem may be ensuring the power grid's
control systems are not vulnerable to cyber break ins. The January
attack in Ukraine was likely caused by a corrupted Microsoft Word
attachment that allowed remote control over the computer, according to
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Scali said [[there was **no
ev**]{.mark}**idence** from the incident in Ukraine that the hacker's
[**malware**]{.mark} was able to **physically [shut down]{.mark}** the
[power]{.mark}.]{.underline} "It wiped out machines, deleted all the
files. Kill disk malware made it impossible to remotely control things.
It caused chaos on the business network, and the area where control
system operations sat. But the attacker, we believe, would have had to
actually used the control system to cause load shedding, which caused
the power to go out, or trip breakers to cause the actual problem.
Malware itself didn't turn the power out," Scali said. He said what most
likely happened in that incident was the hacker stole user credentials
and logged into the system remotely. The bottom line: Yes, a similar
event could happen in the U.S. And corporate America is concerned. A
recent survey released in January on the state of information security,
conducted by consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers, showed
cybersecurity as one of the biggest concerns among the top brass at U.S.
power and utilities firms. Part of the problem, Brad Bauch, security and
cyber sector leader at PwC said, is the interconnectedness of the
industry's tools. "Utilities want to be able to get information out of
\[their\] systems to more efficiently operate them, and also share that
information with customers so they have more real-time information into
their usage," he explained. While allowing access to their own
consumption data allows the companies to give their customers more of
what they want, it also opens up a host of access points for hackers,
making the systems more vulnerable than they otherwise would be. But
[[to say]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} power [grid is susceptible to
cyber]{.mark} hackers [is]{.mark} a bit of an
**[oversimplification]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Paul **Wagenseil 19**, Senior Editor of Security and Privacy at Tom's
Guide, Citing Selena Larson, Intelligence Analyst at Dragos
Cybersecurity Firm, "Hackers Can\'t Cause Crippling Blackouts, Expert
Says", Tom's Guide, 3/11/2019,
https://www.tomsguide.com/us/blackout-hack-threat-rsa2019,news-29594.html

[Don\'t believe the hype. [Hackers cannot]{.mark} easily [take down
the]{.mark} North American electrical [grid]{.mark} to cause massive
blackouts, despite numerous news stories, magazine articles and books
claiming that they can, a cybersecurity expert told the last week\'s RSA
Conference.]{.underline}

\"[There are lots of misunderstandings about threats to the electric
grid,\" said Selena Larson, an **intelligence analyst at** Maryland
**cybersecurity firm** Dragos and a former CNN reporter.]{.underline}
\"[The reality is that [a]{.mark} destructive [incident at one site
would]{.mark} require highly tailored \[malware\] tools and operations,
and would **[not]{.mark} effectively [scale]{.mark}.\"**]{.underline}

[That\'s [because]{.mark} U.S. power [plants use different]{.mark} makes
and [models]{.mark} of hardware and software, are often at least partly
[**isolated from the** internet and]{.mark} from [**each other**, and
have]{.mark} already undergone a **fair degree of [hardening]{.mark}**
against cyberattacks. There\'s **very little chance** that a single
hacker or group of hackers could knock out the power across a large
swath of North America at once.]{.underline}

[Scary headlines]{.underline}

[Those inconvenient facts haven\'t prevented journalists and writers
from penning what Larson deemed needlessly alarming stories. One July
2018 opinion piece in The New York Times]{.underline} entitled \"To
Hackers, We\'re Bambi in the Woods\" [began with a nightmare scenario
of]{.underline} an America thrown back to the [Stone Age by a
cyberattack that kills the power, stops the trains, empties bank
accounts and opens literal floodgates.]{.underline}

[Later that same month, The **[W]{.mark}**all **[S]{.mark}**treet
**[J]{.mark}**ournal [ran a story called \"Russian Hackers Reach]{.mark}
U.S. [Utility Control Rooms,]{.mark} Homeland Security Officials Say,\"
lending credence to the nightmare scenario. But it was
**[incorrect]{.mark}**ly reported --- it was **[based on old
info]{.mark}**rmation that had been **revisited in a DHS
presentation.**]{.underline}

Larson didn\'t mention \"[Lights Out]{.underline}: A Cyberattack, A
Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath,\" [a best-selling 2015
book]{.underline} by former ABC News anchor Ted Koppel.

\"A well-designed attack on just one of the nation\'s three electric
power grids could cripple much of our infrastructure --- and in the age
of cyberwarfare, a laptop has become the only necessary weapon,\" reads
the jacket blurb following [another apocalyptic scenario of a
months-long blackout leading to societal collapse.]{.underline}

State-sponsored attacks

[The truth is that **[Russia]{.mark}**n hackers do try to get into
American power plants, but so far they\'ve [only]{.mark} seemed to be
**[perform]{.mark}**ing **[recon]{.mark}**naissance]{.underline}, Larson
said. [Destructive malware has infected the office networks of some
power companies, but the **[companies weren\'t specifically
targeted]{.mark}**, and the [malware **didn\'t cross over** into]{.mark}
plant **[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

\"A [**[ransomware]{.mark}** infection at the financial-services
division of an electric utility [doesn\'t]{.mark} automatically
[translate to a **blackout**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Larson said.

While most state-sponsored hacker groups targeting power plants and
other industrial-control systems only gather information, two other have
gone further, Larson said. Those were the Electrum group, which used
malware dubbed CrashOverride to take down a Ukrainian power plant in
2016, and the Trisis group, which infected the safety systems at a Saudi
petrochemical plant in 2017.

Both attacks have been attributed to Russian state-sponsored hackers,
and the Saudi-plant attack led another presenter at RSA 2019 to conclude
that cyberattacks would soon kill people, either deliberately or
accidentally.

But [as Dragos founder and CEO Robert M. Lee stated]{.underline} in a
2017 blog posting describing the CrashOverride malware[, \"the public
must understand that the outages could be in hours or days, **not weeks
or months**.\"]{.underline}

Lee said that [Dragos had \"high confidence\" that the CrashOverride
hackers were the same who had in fact targeted U.S. and European
infrastructure companies in 2014]{.underline}. And CrashOverride
contained modules to \"delete files and processes off of the running
systems\" to sabotage computer systems.

Larson said, however, that [the CrashOverride creators had spent months
or years planning the attack, and that the malware was specifically
designed for that power plant. The attacks couldn\'t easily scale across
the world, or even across Ukraine.]{.underline}

Outlook

There are true cyberattack threats out there, Larson added. For example,
the Russian NotPetya ransomware worm in June 2017 cost the Maersk
shipping line an estimated \$200 million, and FedEx an estimated \$300
million. The North Korean WannaCry attack the previous month crippled
hospital computer systems in Europe and North America.

But [in terms of the North American power grid, small animals such as
**squirrels, cats and raccoons are a much larger threat than hackers**,
and have caused hundreds of localized blackouts, Larson said. That
mundane detail doesn\'t sell books.]{.underline}

The [public should be reassured, she added, that the North American
power grid (there are in fact three grids) has always been engineered to
limit both the duration and the geographic reach of blackouts, and that
there\'s no single power switch that can turn it all off.]{.underline}

\"[The truth is that [the]{.mark} North American electric [grid is
**resilient** and **segmented**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Larson said.

**No blackouts**

Selena **Larson 18**, Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst at Dragos, Inc.,
"Threats to Electric Grid are Real; Widespread Blackouts are Not",
8/6/2018,
https://dragos.com/blog/industry-news/threats-to-electric-grid-are-real-widespread-blackouts-are-not/

[**The US electric [grid]{.mark}** [is not about to go
down]{.mark}]{.underline}. Though it's understandable if someone
believed that. Over the last few weeks, numerous media reports suggest
state-backed hackers have infiltrated the US electric grid and are
capable of manipulating the flow of electricity on a grand scale and
cause chaos. [Threats]{.underline} against industrial sectors including
electric utilities, oil and gas, and manufacturing [are
growing,]{.underline} and it's reasonable for people to be concerned.
[But to say hackers]{.underline} have [invaded the US electric grid and
are prepared to cause blackouts is false]{.underline}. The initial
reporting stemmed from a public Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
presentation in July on Russian hacking activity targeting US electric
utilities. This presentation contained previously-reported information
on a group known as Dragonfly by Symantec and which Dragos associates to
activity labeled DYMALLOY and ALLANITE. These
[[groups]{.underline}]{.mark} focus on information gathering from
industrial control system (ICS) networks and [[have not
demonstrated]{.mark} **disruptive or damaging
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While some news reports cite 2015
and 2016 blackouts in Ukraine as evidence of hackers' disruptive
capabilities, DYMALLOY nor ALLANITE were involved in those incidents and
it is inaccurate to suggest the DHS's public presentation and those
destructive behaviors are linked. [Adversaries]{.underline} have not
placed "cyber implants" into the electric grid to cause blackouts; but
they are [infiltrating business networks]{.underline} -- and in some
cases, ICS networks -- in an effort to steal information and
intelligence to potentially gain access to operational systems. Overall,
the activity is concerning and represents the prerequisites towards a
potential future disruptive event -- [but evidence]{.underline} to date
[does not support the claim that such an attack is imminent.
**[The]{.mark} US electric [grid]{.mark}** [is **resilient** and
**segmented**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [although it makes an
interesting plot to an action movie]{.underline}, one or two strains of
malware [**[targeting]{.mark} operational [networks]{.mark}** [would not
cause]{.mark} **widespread [blackouts]{.mark}**. A destructive [incident
at one site would require]{.mark} **highly-[tailored
tools]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and **operations** and would not]{.mark}
**effectively [scale]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Essentially,
[**[localized]{.mark} impacts** [are possible]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
asset owners and operators should work to defend their networks from
intrusions such as those described by DHS. [[But scaling
up]{.underline}]{.mark} from isolated events to widespread impacts
[[is]{.mark} **highly [unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

matter.]{.underline} Note: To be clear, I do not mean to imply we are
"in the clear" and don't need to worry about cybersecurity for the
energy grid. On the contrary, continual efforts on best practices
development, standards creation, regulation and vertical-specific
technologies is of the utmost importance, especially as energy systems
are brought online. I'm merely trying to see through the FUD and
showcase the efforts that have helped keep the grid safe so far. [[Major
Systems Have Been]{.underline} **[Offline]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and
New [Smart Systems Will Be **Secured from the
Start**]{.mark}]{.underline} [Grid [providers are]{.mark} being [hacked
**every day**]{.mark}]{.underline} (303 incidents were reported to the
Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \[ICS-CERT\] in

**unsuccessful**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[due to]{.mark} major
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline} that could cause devastation

[or]{.underline}]{.mark} [accessible [only]{.mark} by **[private

[[Vulnerabilities]{.mark} to older systems [are]{.mark} being
[**addressed** through **retrofits**]{.mark}, but again most of these
systems are offline.]{.underline} The good news is [the next generation
of smart grid systems are being designed with security in mind **from
day one.**]{.underline} One good example is the Open Field Message Bus
(OpenFMB) framework that provides a specification for intelligent power
systems field devices to leverage a nonproprietary and standards-based
reference architecture, which consists of internet protocol (IP)
networking and Internet of Things (IoT) messaging. OpenFMB is one of
Smart Grid Interoperability Panel's (SGIP) Energy IoT initiative
projects, developed to accelerate IoT innovation within the energy
industry. As seen in other industries such as automotive, manufacturing
and smart cities, the value added services around energy grid IoT
innovation are virtually limitless. However, just like other industries,
security concerns are top of mind. That's where the North American
Energy Standards Board's (NAESB) role really proves vital. OpenFMB has
smartly teamed with NAESB to develop a complementary set of standards
for utility providers to follow. Given NAESB's track record of standards
development and tight relationship with NERC and FERC, a set of
standards to accompany OpenFMB's specification is more likely to gather
industry participation and accelerate adoption.

reported, "Highly destructive malware creates 'destructive events' at 3

slightly different perspective in the Risk and Compliance Digest from

launched by or for Russia, in retaliation for Ukrainian activists'
attacks on the power supply to Crimea. That linkage will likely be

warns that "Many of the substations and equipment that move power across
the U.S. are decrepit and were never built with network security in
mind..." [It certainly is the case that many of the capital assets that
comprise the United States grid infrastructure are used beyond their
intended useful life of 25 years or longer.]{.underline} The initial
operations certificates for nuclear power plants were 40 years. Of
course they were never built with network security in mind because 40
years ago networks, if they existed at all, were local and limited
(DECNet, Token Ring, etc.) For reference: [The Hoover Dam was

assumption that the grid has been disabled for months to establish the
assumed starting conditions against which the story of preparedness for
months of no power is told. [The North American utility
[industry]{.mark} would]{.underline} **[[disagree]{.underline}]{.mark}**

this case, Eternal Vigilance is the price of security of our critical

industry remains too smug about the disconnected nature of many critical
systems. In doing so, they overlook the fact that some of the most
successful and devastating cyberattacks have been carried out against
systems that were not connected to the internet, the most prominent

As with many things in Washington, [[a **cottage industry** of
lobbyists]{.mark}, specialists, and ex-government officials [has come
together]{.mark} to attest to the danger of an EMP attack]{.underline}.
Ballistic missile defense seems to be the panacea for this group\'s
concern, though a generous dose of preemption and war on terror are
often prescribed as well. [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[created
a]{.mark} special **[EMP commission]{.mark}** in 2001 to study the
issue]{.underline} and make recommendations to government and industry.
It seems **[[the only ones who]{.underline}]{.mark}** take the time to
talk about EMP publicly, however, are those who **[[believe it]{.mark}
to be the [paramount]{.mark} threat]{.underline}** facing America.
According to their warnings over the last decade, our vulnerability
worsens every day, and that vulnerability invites an attack.

For example, **[EMPact America]{.underline}**, the group that hosted the
conference at Niagara Falls, [has been [on a **lobbying
blitz**]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent weeks to pass the SHIELD Act. The
bill, which is [[backed by the]{.mark} Congressional [**\"EMP Caucus\"**
(yes, such a thing exists)]{.mark}]{.underline} is intended to protect
the electrical grid of the continental United States from the effects of
an EMP attack. [EMPact America even produces a weekly, hour-long radio
show devoted entirely to the issue]{.underline}, with recent guests
including former CIA Director James Woolsey and Congressman Trent
Franks. What sort of response have these warnings gotten so far? [[In
Washington\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [arms control
[circles]{.mark}]{.underline}, where I\'ve spent the past few months
working as part of my research on the Iranian nuclear program,
**[[they\'re not]{.mark} really [taken seriously]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

But how can one side of a debate claim something threatens the very
fiber of U.S. civilization, without getting so much as a nod in return?
Serious public figures have taken up the cause: Congressmen, generals,
scientists and strategists, all without much policy movement to show for
their efforts.

It may be that a terrorist, after going through the trouble of acquiring
a nuclear warhead and a missile capable of delivering it to America\'s
shores, would be a fool to employ the ultimate weapon in such a
cockamamie fashion. The effects of an EMP are far from universal;
according to one commissioned study, a best-case scenario would impact
70 percent of electronics, while a worst-case estimate could be as low
as 5 percent. Far better from the terrorist\'s perspective to deliver
the bomb as it was intended, rather than hang his hopes on a series of
unpredictable events and second- or third-order consequences. After all,
a nuclear bomb need not be made any more devastating to serve a
terrorist\'s purposes.

A slightly more plausible scenario could involve a state actor who,
facing a vastly superior U.S. military massed on its border, might
consider launching an EMP attack against U.S. troops as a way of evening
the playing field. Because the U.S. military is much more highly
dependent on technology than others, a rogue state facing the threat of
invasion could conceivably attempt such a tactic against invading forces
in the hopes that it could damage their capabilities without incurring
the totally devastating retaliation that a \"regular\" nuclear strike
would surely provoke. Of course, a wide-ranging EMP would knock out his
own electronics as much as it would anyone else\'s, so even this
scenario is a bit far-fetched.

But not as far-fetched as it may seem. One country\'s military has
already come close to employing this tactic on the battlefield: our own.
In 1991, Newsweek reported that General Norman Schwarzkopf sought
authorization to use a nuclear EMP to cripple Saddam Hussein\'s forces
at the start of the Gulf War. President George H.W. Bush nixed the plan,
probably because the U.S. isn\'t in the habit of launching nuclear
strikes of even the non-lethal kind, but the idea was tempting enough
that this warfighter took it to his bosses for approval.

[The bulk of the]{.underline} political [[debate]{.underline}]{.mark}
today over EMP [[focuses on how **disastrous** it would be if the
entire]{.mark} country\'s [power went off]{.mark} all at once,
[which]{.mark}]{.underline} arms control experts argue [[is, **to put it
mildly, unlikely**]{.mark}. Even \"ideas man\" Gingrich boils things
down to a biblical catastrophe waiting to happen, but the **[reality is
much more complicated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nuclear weapons, after
all, are more than enough of a threat in their own right. Putting too
much emphasis on something as unlikely as an EMP attack against the
American heartland risks distracting much-needed attention and resources
away from threats that are simply more plausible.

As the Republican presidential primary heats up, Gingrich or another
conservative voice may try to use the EMP \"threat\" as a campaign
issue. So far, it has not been much of a political winner. Of course,
when it comes to the politics of national security, it\'s often the
loudest voice, not the most informed, that prevails.

**[No Grid Impact\-\--No Extinction\-\--AT: Meltdowns]{.underline}**

**Blackouts don't cause meltdowns [and]{.underline} no extinction**

Nick **Stockton 16**, Science Reporter for WIRED magazine, \"Nuclear
Power Is Too Safe to Save the World From Climate Change,\" WIRED,
4/3/2016,
https://www.wired.com/2016/04/nuclear-power-safe-save-world-climate-change/

That's a good deal, but still. [Show a crowd a pair of cooling towers,
and at least some of them will see an atomic apocalypse featuring
three-eyed fish]{.underline}, leafless forests, and hospital-gowned
Soviet defectors with skin like glistening mayonnaise. Nuclear power may
be clean, but people still question whether it is, or ever will be, safe
enough.

Those fears may be moot. Safety concerns didn't delay construction on
Watts Bar Unit 2 for so many years. Economics did. For all that fear,
nuclear power still has the safest track record of any power source.

The Danger

Nuclear energy sources are dangerous because they emit
radiation---particles and energy shed from unstable molecules trying to
calm down. "Those radioactive missiles can hit the human body and damage
cells or DNA," says David Lochbaum, director of the Union of Concerned
Scientist's nuclear safety project. Enough radiation will give you
cancer, or possibly even pass genetic mutations on to your kids. Too
much can kill you outright.

But plants like Watts Bar don't release much radiation into the
environment. Inside, radioactive material heats water, which turns into
steam, which spins the enormous turbines that generate electricity.
Plants regularly release some of that water and steam at rates
prescribed by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and if you live
downriver or downwind of one, the radiation within will raise your
chances of developing a tumor by just one tenth of one percent. You're
far more likely to grow a tumor because you sneak a cigarette now and
again.

But you aren't afraid of routine releases. [You're terrified of another
Three Mile Island, Fukushima, or Chernobyl]{.underline}.

[These disasters were the result of a meltdown, which occurs when
something impedes a reactor's ability to cool the fuel]{.underline}. The
US, where nearly 20 percent of electricity comes from 99 nuclear plants,
uses uranium. Older reactors---which is every reactor in the US,
including Watts Bar Unit 2---use electric pumps to move water through
the system. The [[Fukushima]{.underline}]{.mark} disaster [[showed what
happens if you have]{.mark} pumps but [no power]{.mark} to use
them]{.underline}. [**[New]{.mark}**er **[gen]{.mark}**eration[**s**
rely on **gravity** instead]{.mark}]{.underline}, draining cooling water
from elevated storage tanks to send it through the reactor core.

[Those [**updates** mean]{.mark} serious nuclear [accidents are]{.mark}
becoming **[ever more rare]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Since Three Mile
Island in 1979, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that the rate of
shut-down-the-reactor-level problems has dropped from 2.5 per plant per
year to around 0.1]{.underline} (One such happened on March 29 in
Washington). [[Even Three Mile Island wasn't]{.mark} the
[disaster]{.mark} it could have been, [because of]{.mark} that plant's
layers of **[redundant protection]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[In terms of full blown nuclear disaster, there is really only one data
point: [Chernobyl]{.mark}. Which [was horrifying. But]{.mark} in terms
of [real risk]{.mark}? The **W**orld **H**ealth **O**rganization
estimates the disaster will claim **[4,000 lives]{.mark}**]{.underline},
a figure that includes everything from direct victims to people born
with genetic mutations well after the meltdown in 1986. By comparison,
[particulate matter from coal power plants kills about 7,500 people in
the US **every year**]{.underline}. [[Radiation is the **shark attack**

Emergency systems Nuclear plants obviously require electricity to
operate their cooling pumps, not to mention their control systems. That
power is normally tapped off of the electricity that the reactor
generates. [[If]{.mark} the plant is [offline]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
[[power is provided by]{.underline}]{.mark} the electrical
[[grid]{.underline}]{.mark}. But what happens when the grid itself goes
down? The short answer is that large **[[on-site diesel
generators]{.underline}]{.mark}** automatically activate to provide
electricity. And if those should fail, **[[portable]{.mark} diesel
[generators]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which are also on-site, can be
connected. Recent [[standardization]{.mark} has also [ensured]{.mark}
that [generators can be swapped between plants]{.mark}]{.underline}
without the need to retrofit connectors. [There are also a couple of
[additional emergency systems]{.mark} that [can]{.mark} be used
specifically to [cool]{.mark} the reactor]{.underline}. These include
the [[turbine-driven-auxiliary-feedwater pump]{.underline}]{.mark},
which uses steam generated by the reactor to power a cooling turbine.
The pump requires an operator, but **[it [runs completely without
electricity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This system, however, is meant only
for emergency cooling of the reactor during those critical first few
days when the fuel rod assemblies are being brought down in temperature,
not for long-term cooling. And finally, in the [[worst
case]{.underline}]{.mark}, most [[plants]{.mark} have]{.underline} a
[method of [bringing in]{.mark} river]{.underline} or ocean [[water to
flood the reactor]{.underline}]{.mark}. This typically damages the
cooling system, but again, [it helps to cool and cover the reactor core
should all else fail]{.underline}. Unlike in other countries, permission
from the federal government is not required to flood the reactor.
Worst-case power-loss scenario With backup systems to the backup
systems, it would seem that there's nothing to worry about, right? Under
all but the direst of circumstances, I think that assessment is correct.
However, one could imagine a scenario in which the grid was lost and the
diesel generators ran out of fuel. Speaking of fuel, how much is
actually stored onsite? It depends on the plant, but at the Watts Bar
Nuclear Plant, for example, there is enough fuel to run the emergency
diesel generators for at least 42 days. I say at least because it would
depend on exactly what was being powered. Once the reactor was cooled
down, a much smaller system, known as the Residual Heat Removal System,
would be all that was required to keep the fuel assemblies cool, both in
the reactor and the spent fuel rods pool. The generators and onsite fuel
supply could power that smaller cooling system for significantly longer
than if they were powering the larger reactor cooling system. Even if we
assumed a worst case of 42 days, it's hard to imagine a scenario in
which that would not be enough time to bring in additional fuel either
by land, water, or air. Nonetheless, let's push the question a little
further. What would happen in the unlikely event that the diesel fuel
was exhausted? Even with the reactor having been successfully cooled,
the biggest risk would continue to be overheating of the fuel rod
assemblies, both in the reactor and the spent fuel rods pool. Without
circulation, the heat from the fuel rod assemblies could boil the
surrounding water, resulting in steam. In turn, the water levels would
drop, ultimately exposing the fuel rods to air. Once exposed to air,
their temperatures would rise but not to the levels that would melt the
zirconium cladding. Thankfully, that means that **[[meltdown would not
occur]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The steam might well carry radioactive
contaminants into the air, but [[there would be no]{.mark} release of
hydrogen and, thus, no subsequent [explosions]{.mark}. The situation
would certainly be dangerous to surrounding communities, but [it
wouldn't be]{.mark} the nuclear [Armageddon]{.mark} that many people
worry about.]{.underline}

**No meltdowns impact, and evacuation solves**

Commission Report, 8/2/2011, DailyTech, \"NRC: Far Fewer People Would
Die in a U.S. Nuclear Meltdown Than Previously Thought,\"
https://tinyurl.com/y4aujwkz

The [nuclear crisis at Fukushima]{.underline} Daiichi in Japan has
[caused a nuclear frenzy where leaders around the world are questioning
the safety of their plants.]{.underline} For instance, French President
Nicolas Sarkozy called for global nuclear review after visiting Japan,
and U.S. senators demanded that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
repeat an expensive inspection of the country\'s nuclear power.

But now, [the [NRC]{.mark} is close to completing **a [large nuclear
study]{.mark} that may ease a few worried minds**]{.underline}.

The NRC has been [[working with Sandia]{.underline}]{.mark} National
[[Lab]{.underline}]{.mark}oratories (a Department of Energy lab) [on a
study that **[revises]{.mark}**]{.underline} previous [[**projections**
of how quickly]{.mark} and how much [cesium]{.mark} 137,]{.underline}
which is a radioactive material made when uranium is split, [[could
release from]{.mark} a plant after [a]{.mark} nuclear core
[meltdown]{.mark}]{.underline}. The NRC has been working on the study
for six years, and it will not be completely finished until next spring.
But the nuclear watchdog group, Union of Concerned Scientists, has
obtained an early copy of the report through a Freedom of Information
Act request.

The new study is based on how much and how quickly cesium 137 could
escape an American nuclear plant **[[if a total blackout were to
occur]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A total blackout means complete loss of
power from the grid, and backup diesel generators and batteries have
failed as well. This leads to a nuclear meltdown. NRC scientists said
that a total blackout would be rare at an American plant, but it is
better to be safe than sorry. In addition, the NRC wanted to update
previous projections related to cesium 137.

The NRC focused on two different types of reactors in the U.S.: the
Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, which has
boiling-water reactors like Fukushima Daiichi, and the Surry Power
Station in Virginia, which has pressurized-water reactors. **[[Over
100]{.underline}]{.mark}** different [[plants were studied]{.underline}.
[Through **computer models** and engineering
analyses]{.underline}]{.mark}[, the [NRC]{.mark} has [concluded]{.mark}
that the [meltdown]{.mark}]{.underline} of a typical American reactor
**[[would lead to \"far fewer deaths\"]{.mark} than previously
thought.]{.underline}**

According to the new study, **[[only 1 to 2 percent]{.mark} of a reactor
core\'s cesium 137 [could escape]{.mark}]{.underline}** during a total
blackout. Previous NRC estimates concluded that 60 percent of the cesium
inventory could escape.

In addition, the new study found that **[[one person in every 4,348
within a 10-mile radius]{.underline}]{.mark}** of a nuclear meltdown
[[would develop]{.mark} a \"latent [cancer]{.mark}\"]{.underline} from
radiation exposure. In previous estimates, it was one person in every
167.

The NRC said that [large releases of radioactive material would not be
\"immediate,\" meaning]{.underline} that [[people]{.underline}]{.mark}
within a 10-mile radius **[would [have plenty of time to
evacuate]{.mark}]{.underline}** the premises. It concluded that the
chance of death from acute radiation exposure within a 10-mile radius
would be near zero, but some would be exposed to high enough doses to
experience fatal cancers decades later.

\"[[Accidents progress]{.mark} more [slowly]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
some cases much more slowly, [than previously assumed,\"]{.underline}
said Charles G. Tinkler, a senior adviser for research on severe
accidents and an author of the study. \"[Releases are
smaller]{.underline}, and in some cases much smaller, of certain key
radioactive materials.\"

With self-defense now anchored on national security interests, it has
released its former connections to time and to armed attack. From this

Conclusion

Amid deep conflict over basic norms, Egypt and the GCC states have
maneuvered between two poles while enjoying the tacit, if not explicit,
support of both sides. This has three key implications. First, global
cyber norms are much more complex --- and much more entangled with
traditional governance practices, diplomatic relationships, and
strategic concerns --- than Western officials may like to admit. However
uncomfortable it may be, [international policymaking on cyber norms must
take into account]{.underline} not only the "likemindedness" of some
states, but also [the fact of]{.underline} their [strategic
interests]{.underline} and relationships [with]{.underline} other
[[states]{.mark} that [are]{.mark}]{.underline} less or [**[not]{.mark}
at all [likeminded]{.mark}**. Without this recognition, [**any attempt**
to create]{.mark} global [cyber norms is **hampered**]{.mark} **from the
start**]{.underline}. More broadly, [to understand the **complexity** of
cyber norms we must **look outside** the framework of **great power**
competition]{.underline}.

Second, the United States and European allies of Egypt and the Gulf
states need to decide where their priorities lie: [[Does
consistency]{.mark} on global cyber norms **[outweigh]{.mark}** broader
[**security** considerations?]{.mark}]{.underline} If a stable, coherent
set of cyber norms is the primary aim, greater attention should be given
to persuading friendly states to stay within the boundaries of these
norms. However, if [[security]{.mark} alliances [**trump** cyber
norms]{.mark}]{.underline}, Western democracies should recognize that
[the [**rhetorical effect** of denouncing **Russia**]{.mark}n or Chinese
action [will be **limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the United States,
effective foreign policy regarding cyber security in the Middle East
requires both the identification of a clear national interest, connected
to broader strategic goals concerning the kind of cyber space the United
States seeks to promote, and a good understanding of the evolving
landscape in which the U.S. government and U.S. companies are operating.
Right now, both are lacking.

Third, although the contradictions outlined here suggest that human
rights and national security are important starting points for research,
we should not confine cyber security research on these states to these
well-trodden paths. In the Middle East, cyber security is changing
regional alliances, altering the economic calculations of businesses,
and reforging fundamental relationships between individuals and their
governments. [[There are **significant differences** in]{.mark} cyber
security [approaches between]{.mark}]{.underline} these
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially in Kuwait and Qatar. And there
are many new initiatives and organizations, like Saudi Arabia's National
Cyber Security Authority (al-hai'a al-watniyya lil-'amn al-sibrani),
Egypt's High Council for Cybersecurity, the UAE's National Electronic
Security Agency, and Oman's Arab Region Cybersecurity Centre. As our
understanding of cyber security evolves and its connection to other
areas of foreign policy deepens, a broader approach to cyber security
research in this region is urgently needed to adequately understand
these new dynamics and inform future policy choices.

The Necessity of an International Cyberwar Convention

This section presents the case for negotiating an international
convention to govern cyber conflict between states. [Despite growing
threats from actors using ICT for aggressive and illicit purposes, few
treaties address international cyber security issues]{.underline}.
Presently, the main international agreements governing cyber conduct are
the 2001 Convention on Cybercrime (and its Additional Protocol, 2006)
and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's International Information
Security Agreement (2009) (Vihul & Schmitt 2016, 39--40). Both
agreements are severely limited, however, in terms of both their scope
and membership.Footnote17 [Calls for negotiating a comprehensive
international treaty to govern cyber conflict---a so-called E-neva
Convention---have so far met with **disapproval**]{.underline},
especially from Western states (ibid.)Footnote18 To date, the most
elaborate discussions of cyber governance have thus focused on bringing
existing international law to bear on cyber conflict. [The ***[Tallinn
Manual]{.mark}***]{.underline} *on the International Law Applicable to
Cyber Warfare* (2013) [is the most widely cited outcome of such
discussions. This manual [formulates]{.mark} a set of rules [for]{.mark}
how existing **international law**---chiefly *jus ad
bellum*]{.underline}, international humanitarian law [**[(IHL)]{.mark}**
and laws of **state responsibility**---apply in a cyber
context]{.underline} (Talinn Manual 2013; Schmitt and Vihul 2014a, b,
2016; Lucas 2016). [[But]{.mark} while the Tallinn Manual]{.underline}
(hereafter "the Manual") [provides a useful starting point for focusing
attention on the need for stronger international cyber-governance, [its
**practical value**]{.mark} as an instrument [to restrain]{.mark} cyber
conflict [is **modest**]{.mark} for (at least) three reasons.
[First]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Lucas points out (2017, 40), [the Manual
has **generally [failed to gain support outside]{.mark} the narrow group
of [NATO]{.mark} member-states** that sponsored it. [Second, the]{.mark}
Manual does not propose or promulgate new international rules for the
cyber domain but merely offers an **[interp]{.mark}**retation of how
existing laws may apply. So far, this interpretation has **largely
[failed to persuade states to restrain]{.mark} their activities** in the
cyber domain]{.underline} (Lucas 2017, 17). [What is more, the
**[interp]{.mark}**retation [of **many**]{.mark} *jus ad bellum* and
*jus in bello* treaty [provisions]{.mark} as applied to cyber conflict
[remain **unsettled**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 43).
[[Anticipating]{.underline}]{.mark}, as some of the leading legal
scholars behind the Manual do, [that "interpretative [dilemmas]{.mark}
concerning treaty law [will]{.mark} be **[resolve]{.mark}**d
[through]{.mark} the recurrent [practice]{.mark} of states in their
application"]{.underline} (Ibid., 43--44) [[seems
**optimistic**]{.mark}, especially when considering that the
interpretation offered in the Manual has **so far failed to influence
state practice** or opinio juris]{.underline}. Third, even if states
were to agree on the general applicability of jus ad bellum and IHL in
the cyber domain (which presently they do not), such agreement would
hardly suffice. Each one of the international treaties and conventions
currently governing the production, stockpiling, sale, transfer, and use
of specific classes of armaments is testament to the states' recognition
that the general international prohibition on the use of force and IHL
are by themselves insufficient to prevent or restrain international
armed conflict.

**U.S. restraint [doesn't]{.underline} cause global follow-on**

Great, and the Risks Exist Anyway," New York Times, 6/4/2012,

[Nor do cyberattacks against Iran increase the risk of damaging
cyberattacks against the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. It is
true that we are defenseless; efforts to make us safer are hamstrung by
self-interest, ideology and the gridlock of American politics. But [**we
are no more vulnerable today** than we were the day before the news. If
someone decides to attack us, [they may cite]{.mark} Iran as [precedent,
but]{.mark} **it will [only]{.mark} be [to justify a decision
they]{.mark} had [already made]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

We could ask whether the United States creates more problems for itself
when it makes public a new weapon while potential opponents keep it
secret. [Four [other countries can launch]{.mark} sophisticated and
damaging [cyber attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- [including China and
Russia]{.underline} \-- [and **plan to use them** in
warfare]{.underline}. Another **[[30 nations are acquiring]{.mark} cyber
weapons]{.underline}**, including Iran and North Korea.

[[There is a]{.mark} very [old a**rg**]{.mark}ument]{.underline} for
disarmament [[that]{.mark} holds that [if]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[were to renounce]{.mark} some weapons]{.underline} \-- usually nuclear
weapons \-- [[the world would be]{.mark} a [better]{.mark} place.
[This]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[utopianism]{.underline}** [has a revered
place]{.underline}]{.mark} [in American political thinking, [but when
humans invent]{.mark} weapons [they **rarely give**]{.mark} **them

**[[Cyber]{.mark}attack [is now part]{.mark} of warfare]{.underline}**,
no different from any other weapon. The publicity around Stuxnet may
complicate U.S. efforts to get international rules for the use of
cyberattack, but the White House decided that tampering with Iran's
nuclear program was more important than possible risk to slow-moving
negotiations.

Realists in this regard are from Missouri, the "show me" state, and ask
utopians to explain how, why, and when a powerful new cooperative
international norm with corresponding international institutions will
become a reality. [[Realists point to]{.mark} the unhappy history of the
unmet claims and [dashed hopes of]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[1928
[Kellogg-Briand]{.mark} Pact]{.underline}** (intended to prevent
offensive war by global legal agreement), [the]{.underline} [**[League
of Nations]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[the
U]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[nited [N]{.mark}ations]{.underline}**. To be
sure, the future does not have to be bound by the past, but before
moving further toward nuclear disarmament, [realists want to see some
clear evidence of the emerging transformation of the global
order---**not just the claim** that it can occur if all key leaders are
so willing, faithful, and visionary and can "embrace a politics of
impossibility."]{.underline}12 As the old English proverb says, "If
wishes were horses, then beggars would ride." But [has not everything
changed in the twenty-first century?]{.underline} [[Has not the end of
the Cold War ushered in]{.mark} a new [global commitment to
**coop**]{.mark}eration]{.underline}, [the [rule of
law]{.mark}]{.underline} globally, [and benign conflict resolution?
**The [unarguable]{.mark} answer is [no.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
**[[Russian]{.mark} military [actions]{.mark}]{.underline}** against
Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine since 2014 (the latter in direct violation
of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum signed by Russia, Great Britain, and the
United States) are sufficient empirical evidence to demonstrate that
Thucydides' stark description of reality is alive and well.
**[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark}** [expansionist
[claims]{.mark}]{.underline} and military pressure against its neighbors
in the East and South China Seas teach the same lesson. Why is this
reality significant in the consideration of nuclear weapons? Because in
the absence of reliably overturning the powerful norm of raison d'État
and Thucydides' explanation of international relations, states with the
capability and felt need will continue to demand nuclear capabilities
for their own protection and, in some cases, to provide cover for their
expansionist plans. To wit, if Ukraine had retained nuclear weapons,
would it now fear for its survival at the hands of Russian aggression?
Former Ukrainian defense minister Valeriy Heletey and members of the
Ukrainian parliament have made this point explicitly, lamenting
Ukraine's transfer of its nuclear forces to Russia in return for
now-broken security promises of the Budapest Memorandum.13 This lesson
cannot have been lost on other leaders considering the value of nuclear
weapons. Nor is it a coincidence that US allies in Central Europe and
Asia are becoming ever more explicit about their need for US nuclear
assurances under the US extended nuclear deterrent (i.e., the nuclear
umbrella). They see no new emerging, powerful global collective security
regime or cooperative norms that will preserve their security; thus,
they understandably seek the assurance of power, including nuclear
power. The Polish Foreign Ministry observed in a recent press release
that "the current situation reaffirms the importance of NATO's nuclear
deterrence policy."14 [This [reality stands in **stark
contrast**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to **utopian claims**]{.underline}
[that]{.underline}]{.mark} [powerful **new global [norms]{.mark}** and
international institutions [will **reorder the**]{.mark} **international
[system]{.mark}**, overturn Thucydides, and allow individual states to
**dispense with nuclear weapons** or the nuclear protection of a
powerful]{.underline} ally. As the Socialist French president Francois
Hollande has said, "The international context does not allow for any
weakness. . . . The era of nuclear deterrence is therefore not over. . .
. In a dangerous world---and it is dangerous---France does not want to
let down its guard. . . . The possibility of future state conflicts
concerning us directly or indirectly cannot be excluded."15 There could
be no clearer expression of Thucydides' description of international
relations and its contemporary implications for nuclear weapons.
Opponents of the administration's plan to modernize the US triad now
double down on the utopian narrative by insisting that the United States
instead lead the way in establishing the new global norm by showing that
Washington no longer relies on nuclear weapons and does not seek new
ones. Washington cannot expect others to forgo nuclear weapons if it
retains them, they say, and thus it must lead in creation of the new
norm against nuclear weapons by providing an example to the world. For
instance, "by unilaterally reducing its arsenal to a total of 1,000
warheads, the United States would encourage Russia to similarly reduce
its nuclear forces without waiting for arms control negotiations."16 A
good US example supposedly can help "induce parallel" behavior in
others.17 If, however, the United States attributes continuing value to
nuclear weapons by maintaining its arsenal, "other countries will be
more inclined to seek" them.18 Nuclear realists respond, however, that
the United States already has reduced its nuclear forces deeply over the
last 25 years. America cut its tactical nuclear weapons from a few
thousand in 1991 to a "few hundred" today.19 Moreover, US-deployed
strategic nuclear weapons have been cut from an estimated 9,000 in 1992
to roughly 1,600 accountable warheads today, with still more reductions
planned under the New START Treaty.20 The United States has even decided
to be highly revealing of its nuclear capabilities to encourage others
to do so, with no apparent effect on Russia, China, or North Korea.21
America has adhered fully to the reductions and restrictions of the 1987
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty---the "centerpiece of arms
control"---but the Russians now are in open violation. As former
undersec- retary of state Robert Joseph stated recently, decades of deep
US reductions "appear to have had no moderating effect on Russian,
Chinese or North Korean nuclear programs. Neither have U.S. reductions
led to any effective strengthening of international nonproliferation
efforts."22 [**[Utopians]{.underline}** [want]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [to **lead**]{.mark} the world
toward nuclear disarmament [by]{.mark} its [**good example**, but **no
one is following**. The]{.mark} basic [reason]{.mark}, realists point
out, [is]{.mark} that [foreign leaders make decisions]{.mark} about
nuclear weaponry [based]{.mark} largely **[on]{.mark} their countries'
[strategic needs]{.mark}**]{.underline}, raison d'État, [**[not]{.mark}
in deference to [America's penchant]{.mark}** for nuclear disarmament or
some sense of global fairness]{.underline}. A close review of India by
S. Paul Kapur, for example, concluded that "Indian leaders do not seek
to emulate US nuclear behavior; they formulate policy based primarily on
their assessment of the security threats facing India."23 The same
self-interested calculation is true for other nuclear and aspiring
nuclear states. Nations that are a security concern to the United States
seek nuclear weapons to intimidate their neighbors (including US
allies), to counter US conventional forces, and to gain a free hand to
press their regional military ambitions. They see nuclear weapons as
their trump cards and do not follow the US lead in nuclear disarmament.
A bipartisan expert working group at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies concluded accordingly that "U.S. nuclear
reductions have no impact on the calculus of Iran and North Korea."24

military cyber **[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Although Chinese strategists describe cyberspace as a highly asymmetric
and decisive domain of warfare, [China's military [cyber **capacity**
does **not** live up to]{.mark} its **doctrinal [aspirations]{.mark}**[.
A]{.mark} disruptive [attack]{.mark} on physical infrastructure
[requires **careful testing**]{.mark}, **painstaking

pursuit of military "informatization"]{.underline} (i.e., emulation of
the U.S. network-centric style of operations) [increases its
**dependence** on vulnerable networks and exposure to foreign
cyberattack]{.underline}.

[To be sure, [China]{.mark} engages in aggressive [cyber

government entities. [These activities, however, [**do not** constitute

**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, and they do nothing to
defend China from the considerable intelligence and military advantages
of the United States.

**China's [closed]{.underline} system prevents necessary improvements**

So [[how much should we worry]{.mark} about China's cyber
capabilities?]{.underline}

**[[Not much]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to Professor Jon R.
Lindsay's new policy brief, published by Harvard University's Belfer
Center. Public record on U.S. and Chinese cyber capabilities remains
scant, but Lindsay suggests that the U.S. is gaining an "increasing
advantage," evidenced by a new DARPA program launched in 2012, and the
use of the Stuxnet worm to damage computer systems at an Iranian nuclear
enrichment facility in 2010. In America's private cyber industry, the
name of the game has shifted from defense to offense.

But [[China's interest]{.mark} in]{.underline} developing
[cyber]{.underline} capabilities [[is **political, not
military**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Lindsay argues, prompting incursions
into foreign digitized space to suppress dissent, in the case of GitHub,
or to steal secrets from adversaries. Even so, "lax law enforcement, and
poor cyber defenses leave the country vulnerable to both cybercriminals
and foreign spies," Lindsay notes, suggesting that [China **struggles**
to use the information it comes away with for political
gain]{.underline}. China's successful campaigns target NGOs and private
sector companies, and "do nothing to defend China from the considerable
intelligence and military advantages of the United States."

That doesn't mean that the PLA isn't busy playing catch-up. In a recent
issue of The Science of Military Strategy, put out by the military's
chief research institution, analysts concede that the PLA indeed
possesses network attack forces inside of intelligence and civilian
wings of government, including the Ministry of State Security and the
Ministry of Public Security. It suggests that [the [military will deal
with]{.mark} critical **[infrastructure]{.mark}** targets]{.underline},
like electrical grids and gas pipelines, while smaller, nimbler hacking
units like Axiom, which has been suspected in intrusions against Fortune
500 companies and pro-democracy groups, will focus on industrial
targets.

[[But]{.mark} making [that leap will be **challenging**]{.mark}, and
would force China to walk back its global positions on cybersecurity.
Beijing hopes to become a leader on that front]{.underline} and has been
heavily promoting its concept of "internet sovereignty" as the basis for
international standards of behavior in cyber space. China wants to
defend "internet sovereignty" at all costs. Any future cyber attack
would probably be justified on those grounds.

[That's]{.underline} [[also]{.mark} a **[self-limiting]{.mark}** belief.
While [it]{.mark} has [allowed **home-grown** giants]{.mark} like Weibo,
Alibaba, and Baidu [to flourish]{.mark}, China's [**exclusion** of
American companies]{.mark} and know-how [put it at a **serious
disadvantage**]{.mark} in **[building robust]{.mark} cyber
[capabilities]{.mark}**[. China's]{.mark} own [approach]{.mark} to these
issues could [**prevent** Beijing from **reaching**]{.mark} **its cyber
[potential]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Cyber]{.underline}security [issues]{.underline} [have]{.underline}
increasingly [been singled out as an irritant in the]{.underline} United
States([US)-China bilateral relationship]{.underline}. [US-China
relations in cyberspace **exemplify** tensions in the
**broader**]{.underline} bilateral **[relationship]{.underline}**,
[canvassing **military** competition, **trade** barriers, **intelligence
activity**, and pathways to long-term **economic and political
strength**]{.underline}.\[1\] [However, cybersecurity is still a
**nascent foreign policy issue**]{.underline}. Much of the existing
literature on cybersecurity in international relations addresses the
issue through the lens of policy rather than theory. This paper is a
contribution to bridging the gap between policy and theory. It examines
the extent to which offensive realist theory helps us understand how the
US and China are managing their relations on cybersecurity. I argue that
the US is a hegemon in cyberspace, and China a revisionist power. Based
on that assessment, I consider the likelihood of cyberwar, the issue of
economic espionage, their respective approaches to Internet governance,
and conclude that offensive realism provides a useful framework for
considering security-related issues. However, it cannot explain the full
range of bilateral cyber-related activity, including examples of
cooperation and norm-building in cyberspace. I briefly touch on liberal
theories' ability to explain other elements of the relationship and
conclude that given the breadth of cyber-related issues, an
issue-specific or analytically eclectic approach may be the most
fruitful. The framework for analysis: offensive neorealism Offensive
realism refers to a sub-school of neorealist international relations
theory, which developed from Kenneth Waltz's work on structural
realism.\[2\] The classical realism of thinkers like Hans Morgenthau had
focused on human nature.\[3\] Waltz shifted realism's focus to the
international system, positing that the anarchic structure of the
international system forces states to pursue power to ensure their
survival. Power -- measured by the relative distribution of economic and
military capabilities across the system -- is a state's only guarantee
of security. Subsequently, sub-schools of defensive and offensive
realism have developed based on Waltz's work.\[4\] This paper focuses on
the applicability of John J. Mearsheimer's offensive realism to US-China
cybersecurity relations.\[5\] I have chosen offensive realism as the
basis for my analysis because the relationship is popularly
characterized as conflictual. Offensive neorealism posits that great
powers seek to ensure their security by maximising their share of world
power. Being the dominant power -- a hegemon -- is the best means to
ensure survival. States therefore are "primed for offense".\[6\]
Mearsheimer makes five key assumptions about the international system,
which together cause states to formulate aggressive policies.\[7\] These
are: (1) anarchy is the ordering principle of the international system;
(2) great powers possess some military capability; (3) states can never
be certain about other states' intentions; (4) survival is the primary
goal of great powers; and (5) that great powers are rational
actors.\[8\] I will treat these assumptions as given for the purposes of
my analysis. Combined, these factors result in three patterns of
behaviour: fear, self-help, and power maximisation.\[9\] Unable to trust
other states, and aware that they operate in a self-help system, states
view becoming the most powerful states in the system as the best way to
ensure survival.\[10\] States look to maximise their power and alter the
balance of power using a variety of tools -- even if doing so makes
other states suspicious or hostile.\[11\] Capability is what matters,
given the intentions of other states are uncertain. States will lie,
cheat and use force if it can help them gain an advantage.\[12\] All
great powers will have revisionist tendencies until they achieve
hegemony, resulting in constant security competition.\[13\] Finally, in
Mearsheimer's view, multipolar systems are more likely to result in
conflict than bipolar systems, and multipolar systems with an emerging
hegemon are the most dangerous ("unbalanced multipolarity").\[14\] What
is the current balance of power in cyberspace? In order [to understand
whether there is a security competition in cyberspace, it is necessary
to **assess the current balance of power**.]{.underline} Because I am
considering cybersecurity in isolation from the wider bilateral
relationship this analysis necessarily will be artificial, focusing only
on relative cyberpower (broadly defined). [Mearsheimer defines a hegemon
as a "state that is so powerful that it dominates all the other states
in the system."]{.underline}\[15\] A state that is substantially more
powerful than other powers in the system is not a hegemon -- a hegemon
is the only great power.\[16\] Mearsheimer concludes that it is
virtually impossible for a state to become a global power because of the
difficulties in projecting power across the world's oceans.\[17\]
However, **[the US]{.underline}** arguably **[has hegemonic power in
cyberspace]{.underline}**, [where geographic boundaries **do not affect
power projection**]{.underline}. [The US, thanks to its role in the
Internet's creation and development, retains a **huge amount of
influence** over its operations and governance]{.underline}. [Ten of the
Internet's 13 root servers are on US soil, and China, like many other
states, is still **reliant on technology from American
firms**]{.underline} like Microsoft.\[18\] Secondly, the US is generally
believed to have the most significant cyber offensive capabilities in
the world. [While cyber capability is shrouded in secret, the US is
likely to]{.underline} [have]{.underline} a **[good chance at dominating
other great powers in cyberspace]{.underline}**. [The question
is]{.underline} then [whether there are any other great powers in
cyberspace. China has arguably risen as a cyber power]{.underline},
though its (known) activities to date are computer-network exploitation
for intelligence rather than attacks causing disruption.\[19\] China
sees cyber power as a cost effective, long range way to counter a
superior adversary in conflict.\[20\] China has also become increasingly
influential in global policy debates on Internet governance issues, as
will be discussed below. [However, [the US has]{.mark} considerably
[more **experience**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in]{.underline}
**[managing]{.underline}**]{.mark} complex **[[network
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and the P]{.mark}eoples'
[L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy [faces]{.mark} **sizeable
[challenges]{.mark}** implementing cyber tactics]{.underline}.\[21\]
[Cyberspace also is not]{.underline} a simple [bipolar]{.underline}
world. [Russia]{.underline}, for instance, [is]{.underline} widely
[considered to be one of the most capable actors in
cyberspace]{.underline} and is believed to have deployed offensive cyber
capability in support of its wider objectives (most recently shutting
down a power grid in the Ukraine). Cyber capabilities also are
proliferating widely, in part because of low barriers to entry.\[22\]
Cyberspace therefore can loosely be characterized as a multipolar
system. [In an unbalanced multipolar system, we should expect to see an
ongoing **security competition**]{.underline}, based on calculations of
relative state power. [The US will seek to check China's
activity]{.underline} to maintain its hegemony. [China, as an aspiring
hegemon and revisionist power, will **use force to alter the status quo
if the benefits outweigh the costs.**]{.underline}\[23\] The polarity of
the system will make states fearful and security competition is likely
to be particularly acute in the cyber context. The secrecy shrouding
states' cyber capabilities makes it difficult to measure relative
capability, which will increase suspicion. A spiral of mistrust --
should we expect the outbreak of cyberwar? [Relations between the US and
China indeed have been marked by fear and mistrust]{.underline}. Growing
concerns about competitive advantage have exacerbated that mistrust,
along with ongoing intelligence activities and political rhetoric. China
is suspicious that the US is using its dominance in cyberspace to
undermine other states, which suggests a sense of vulnerability, and US
has a deep sense of unease about a rising China.\[24\] Offensive realism
suggests that how much states fear each other determines the severity of
their security competition as well as the likelihood that they will
fight a war.\[25\] As signaled above, [states cannot accurately assess
their **relative cyberpower**]{.underline} [because offensive cyber
capabilities tend to be **highly classified**]{.underline}. Fear has
therefore driven both states to invest in offensive and defensive
capabilities.\[26\] [There is]{.underline} also [an incentive for both
to **misrepresent their strength**, so the **true balance of power** is
**unclear**]{.underline}.\[27\] This may lead to a misperception of
dominance, particularly when the effectiveness of 'cyberweapons' is
poorly understood.\[28\] [However, a [cyber conflict]{.mark} between the
US and China [is **highly unlikely**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Examples of
attacks with destructive]{.mark} or physical [consequences are]{.mark}
still very [rare]{.mark}]{.underline} (although the number may be
increasing). Since the late 1980s, there have been 61 attacks conducted
by states against during peacetime, and 24 during wartime.\[29\]
Examples include Russian attacks on Georgia in 2008 and the infamous
Stuxnet attack on Iranian nuclear infrastructure (usually attributed to
the US and Israel).\[30\] [[**No state** has]{.mark} ever
[declared]{.mark} a '[cyberwar']{.mark}]{.underline}.\[31\] This is
[partly because to develop sophisticated attacks like Stuxnet is very
difficult]{.underline}, requiring high levels of technical
expertise.\[32\] [**[Attribution]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[also notoriously [difficult]{.mark}]{.underline} in cyberspace. It is
extremely tough to trace attacks and states may also use proxy or
non-state actors, further confusing the issue.\[33\] [Until recently,
the failure to develop an effective deterrence policy has been related
to the difficulty in attributing cyberattacks. Nevertheless, [the US
has]{.mark} "[reserve\[d\] the right to use all]{.mark} necessary
[means]{.mark} -- diplomatic, informational, military, and economic --
as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law" [to
respond]{.mark} to hostile acts in cyberspace.\[]{.underline}34\] China
has not used 'force' against the US in cyberspace [but it is clear that
cyberattacks would feature in any broader military clash. [Difficulties
arise in considering]{.mark} what constitutes a **[proportionate
response]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}
**[low-level]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[attacks]{.underline}** [like
**[hacking]{.mark}** or **cybercrime**]{.underline}. [[It is **very
unlikely that any incident**]{.mark} **of that nature [could justify
a]{.mark} traditional [military response]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[35\]
[To date, [countermeasures]{.mark} have [fall]{.mark}en **[well
below]{.mark} the use of [military force]{.mark}**. [The US]{.mark} has
[instead relied on **diplomatic** and **law enforcement tools**]{.mark}:
**attribution**, [**indictments**, and]{.mark} the **threat of
[sanctions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[36\] Cyber-enabled espionage -- a
constant, low level conflict? Intense security competition between the
US and China is much more evident when considering the issue of
cyber-enabled espionage. As a trading state, China has benefited from
Internet connectivity, but it is still a net importer of advanced
technology.\[37\] To maintain high growth levels in an innovation-driven
world, economic espionage is a useful shortcut, and economic power is
fungible.\[38\] The US has consistently alleged that China is conducting
economic espionage on a massive scale to support Chinese firms. Good
evidence exists to support this allegation. For instance, one study
found that "96 percent of recorded, state-affiliated attacks targeting
businesses' trade secrets and other intellectual property in 2012 could
be traced by to Chinese hackers."\[39\] While each loss might be small,
the net effect has been described as "the most significant transfer of
wealth in history."\[40\] In response, China has consistently accused
the US of hypocrisy, supported by evidence in the Snowden disclosures of
the extent to which the US had penetrated a range of Chinese companies
and networks.\[41\] Chinese officials point out that China is the
largest victim of cyber attacks in the world, many emanating from the
US.\[42\] In China's view, the US has no "moral standing" to make
accusations against China or define norms of appropriate behaviour
online.\[43\] Despite this, the US has attempted to draw a distinction
between espionage for national security purposes and economic espionage
for the benefit of a states' firms (such as China's state-owned
enterprises). While China has historically refused to acknowledge this
distinction, US policy has been calibrated both to develop this norm and
to raise the costs of Chinese activity. Until recently, actions in
cyberspace had been largely penalty-free. Over the last two years, the
US has executed the first steps in a new strategy to change the
cost-benefit-risk calculus for its cyber adversaries.\[44\] In May 2014,
the Department of Justice indicted of five members of the Chinese
Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA) for hacking and commercial espionage
against major US companies.\[45\] Following the high-profile hack of
Sony pictures in December 2014, the US attributed the attack to North
Korean actors -- the first time that the US had publicly attributed an
attack on a US company to a foreign government.\[46\] Then, in April
2015, President Obama signed an executive order allowing the US to
impose severe financial restrictions on individuals or entities who
engage in or benefit from cyber-enabled economic espionage.\[47\] In
advance of President Xi Jinping's first state visit to the US in 2015,
there were serious indications that the Obama administration might
impose sanctions against China in a second major volley on economic
espionage.\[48\] Shortly before the visit, Obama described theft of
intellectual property and trade secrets as an "act of aggression" and a
"core national security threat".\[49\] [Despite previously refusing to
accept the US distinction between 'acceptable' espionage]{.underline}
for national security [and 'unacceptable']{.underline} economic
espionage, President [Xi reached a landmark agreement with]{.underline}
President [Obama]{.underline} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} September
[[2015]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The two leaders agreed that
"neither]{.underline} country's government [will conduct or knowingly
support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property]{.underline},
including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with
the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or
commercial sectors."\[50\]\[51\] [The agreement was an unexpected
reversal of the Chinese position.]{.underline} Offensive realism
suggests that China may have signed the agreement for two reasons.
Threatened with sanctions, China made a rational choice -- the costs of
cyber activity against the US were rising and it was in China's interest
to agree. More pessimistically, [[China]{.mark} may also have [signed
with **no intention of adhering**]{.mark}]{.underline} to the agreement.
[Offensive realism suggests that]{.underline} concerns about
[**[cheating will hinder coop]{.mark}eration**, [as states
**fear**]{.mark} that [the other]{.mark} side [will cheat]{.mark},
putting them at a disadvantage]{.underline}. \[52\] [**Subsequent
[evidence]{.mark}** [suggests]{.mark} that [China is **not
complying**]{.mark} with the agreement]{.underline}. [The Director of
National Intelligence noted]{.underline} in February 2016 [that "China
continues to have success in cyber espionage against the U.S.
government, our allies, and U.S. companies.]{.underline}"\[53\]
[Continuing Chinese activity suggests that the US **has not succeeded in
raising the real costs of economic espionage**]{.underline}. The costs
of an indictment and the threat of sanctions are slight in comparison to
the benefits China is reaping from its economic espionage
practices.\[54\] Cheating on a cyber agreement may also be simpler
because deception is a core part of network intrusions.\[55\] As long as
the benefits to China outweigh the risks, there is no reason to stop.
[For the US, it appears that more significant punishments may be too
costly or escalatory to pursue.]{.underline}\[56\] Some of this
reluctance likely derives from concerns about damaging relations with a
state with a major economic market.\[57\]

**[No China War\-\--1NC]{.underline}**

**No US-China war.**

Cui **Lei 20**, PhD and MA in International Politics, associate research
fellow with the China Institute of International Studies, \"Despite
heated talk, risk of a US-China hot war is small\", South China Morning
Post, 7-24-2020,
https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3094121/why-risk-us-china-hot-war-small-despite-heated-talk

[Many]{.underline} observers [are pessimistic about deteriorating
US-China relations and believe the two countries are **heading
towards**]{.underline} a cold **[war]{.underline}**. Even worse, [some
argue that the situation might be **more dangerous** than the US-Soviet
Union Cold War, and that a **hot war might break out** between the two.
This argument is **unconvincing**]{.underline}.

**[First]{.underline}** of all, [[**deterrents** to a flare-up
are]{.underline}]{.mark} much **[[strong]{.underline}]{.mark}**er [**[in
US-China relations]{.mark}** than in US-Soviet relations]{.underline}.
Although economic and people-to-people ties between China and the US are
declining, they are still close compared to US-Soviet ties. [[It is
**hard to decouple**]{.mark} two **[closely intertwined
economies]{.mark}** and **societies**.]{.underline}

Take two examples. [[China]{.mark} [is]{.mark} expected to become [the
world\'s **largest**]{.mark} **consumer [market]{.mark}**, a temptation
**hard to resist** for exporters, **including** those from the US. And
in **education**, more than **300,000 Chinese students** study in the
US, bringing in **huge revenues** for the US education
industry]{.underline}.

Many universities go to great lengths to woo international students.
Recently Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology even sued
the government over its new visa restrictions, now aborted, on
international students.

[Second, **even if** there is decoupling, the pain would **not be too
great** and can be **kept out** of the **national security
sphere**]{.underline} if properly handled. In fact, for national
security reasons, a modest degree of isolation will make both sides more
secure and comfortable. For instance, if China's information technology
equipment cannot capture Western markets, the US will be more relaxed.
If China cannot get advanced technologies from the US and its
technological progress slows down, the US will be less anxious.

In the same vein, China feels assured knowing that if the Trump
administration does impose a travel ban on Communist Party members, it
would be abandoning one of the tools available to the US to promote
"peaceful evolution" in China.

Economic decoupling is undeniably more painful for China than for the
US. But unlike Japan during WWII, which was hit hard by the US oil
embargo because of its lack of natural resources, China has no such
problems. Given its large domestic market, losing the US as a major
customer is not a disaster for China, and can be compensated through
more dynamic economic activities at home. China can also make up for
being freezed out of technological exchanges by turning to indigenous
innovation.

As for the US, it can import goods from other developing countries,
albeit less cheaply. The relative loss is acceptable when weighed
against the heightened perception of economic independence and security.

[Third, the ideological confrontation between China and the US is **less
intense**]{.underline} than that during the Cold War. Unlike the
obsession with ideology in those days, [the line between capitalism and
socialism is **blurred** today. The **market economy** has become
**universally recognised** as the best way to promote economic
growth]{.underline} and, politically, many countries have embraced
democracy. Even North Korea calls itself the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.

Although ideological hawks in the US still long for the day when the
beacon of freedom will light up the world, [after **many years** of
fighting **bloody wars overseas**, most American people are **not
interested** in promoting democracy abroad]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
[China just wants to **preserve its political system** and has **no
interest in exporting it** to other countries, as the Soviet Union
did.]{.underline}

[Thus, ideological **antagonism** in China-US relations can easily be
**eased** by calculations of realistic **interests**, which create
conditions for **compromise and cooperation**.]{.underline}

[**Fourth**, both [China and the US have]{.mark} **many [options other
than war]{.mark}** to achieve their policy goals]{.underline}. While
they have no allies to serve as a buffer, given the nature of the
potential conflict in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait,
[[both]{.mark} countries [are **adept at operating in grey
zones**]{.mark} and fighting psychological, public opinion or diplomatic
warfare **below the threshold of war**]{.underline}. The forced closure
of the Chinese consulate in Houston by the US government is just the
latest act of brinkmanship.

In addition, [given China's huge economic and financial interests in
[the US]{.mark}, the latter [can **wield**]{.mark} **the stick of
[sanctions]{.mark}** when use of force is **highly risky** or not worth
it.]{.underline} [[When both]{.mark} sides [have **many tools**]{.mark}
**and options,** [why would they **rush to war**]{.mark} to achieve
their goals?]{.underline}

**[Last]{.underline}** but not least, [the **imbalance of power** will
act as a deterrent]{.underline}. Some say the US and Soviet Union did
not fight a hot war because they were evenly matched. It was not the
case, actually. At the beginning of the Cold War, the Soviet Union was
at a relative military disadvantage.

Moreover, [[a country needs]{.mark} the [**will to fight** before
**going to war**]{.mark}**,** even if it is stronger militarily than its
adversary. [Having fought **years of meaningless wars**, the US is
**weary**]{.mark} **of war**]{.underline}.

[China, too, **abhors war**. Having a **clear understanding** of US
strength, **especially** [when its]{.mark} own [economy is
**slowing**]{.mark} **down** [and]{.mark} [it is facing]{.mark}
**various [domestic challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[China would
**not**]{.mark} **wish** to **[recklessly start a war]{.mark} with the
US**.]{.underline}

[In summary, the possibility of a **hot war** between China and the US
is **very small**]{.underline}. The greatest danger for China is not a
cold or hot confrontation with the US, but policymakers' interpretation
of the momentary hostility towards Beijing of a portion of the American
population and the larger world. An erroneous interpretation could end
China's march to further opening up, and see it turn instead towards
self-isolation.

True, throughout history, when a rising power has challenged a ruling
one, war has often been the result. But there are notable exceptions. [A
war between the US and China]{.underline} today [is no more inevitable
than]{.underline} was war between [the]{.underline} rising [US
and]{.underline} the declining [**U**nited **K**ingdom a century
ago]{.underline}. And in today's context, there are four compelling
reasons to believe that war between the US and China can be avoided.

First and foremost, any [military conflict]{.underline} between the two
[would quickly turn **nuc**lear]{.underline}. The US thus finds itself
in the same situation that it was in vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. Taiwan
could easily become this century's tripwire, just as the "Fulda Gap" in
Germany was during the Cold War. But the same dynamic of
"[**[m]{.mark}**utual **[a]{.mark}**ssured
**[d]{.mark}**estruction"]{.underline} that limited US-Soviet conflict
**[[applies to the US and China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And [the
[international community]{.mark} would do everything]{.underline} in its
power [to [ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that a potential
[**[nuc]{.mark}**lear [conflict did not
materialize]{.mark},]{.underline} [given]{.underline} that [the
consequences]{.underline} would be fundamentally transnational and --
unlike climate change -- immediate.

A **[US-China [conflict]{.mark} would]{.underline}** almost certainly
**[[take the form of a proxy war]{.mark}, rather than a major-power
confrontation]{.underline}**. [Each]{.underline} superpower [might take
a different side in a domestic conflict]{.underline} in a country such
as Pakistan, Venezuela, Iran, or North Korea, [and
[deploy]{.mark}]{.underline} some combination of [[economic, cyber, and
diplomatic instruments]{.underline}]{.mark}. We have seen this type of
conflict many times before: from Vietnam to Bosnia, the US faced
surrogates rather than its principal foe.

Second, it is important to remember that, historically, **[[China plays
a long game]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although Chinese military power has
grown dramatically, [it]{.underline} still [[lags behind the US
on]{.mark} almost [every measure]{.mark} that matters]{.underline}. And
while China is investing heavily in [[asymmetric
equalizers]{.underline}]{.mark} (long-range anti-ship and hypersonic
missiles, military applications of cyber, and more), it [[will not
match]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[US]{.underline}]{.mark} in
[[conventional means]{.underline}]{.mark} such as aircraft and large
ships [for decades, if ever.]{.underline}

A [[head-to-head conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} with the US
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[be **too dangerous for
China**]{.mark} to countenance at its current stage of
development]{.underline}. If such a conflict did occur, China would have
few options but to let the nuclear genie out of the bottle. In thinking
about baseline scenarios, therefore, we should give less weight to any
scenario in which the Chinese consciously precipitate a military
confrontation with America. The US military, however, tends to plan for
worst-case scenarios and is currently focused on a potential direct
conflict with China -- a fixation with overtones of the US-Soviet
dynamic.

This raises the risk of being blindsided by other threats. Time and
again since the Korean War, asymmetric threats have proven the most
problematic to national security. Building a force that can handle the
worst-case scenario does not guarantee success across the spectrum of
warfare.

The third reason to think that a Sino-American conflict can be avoided
is that [China is already [chalking up victories in]{.mark}
the]{.underline} global [[soft-power]{.mark} war]{.underline}.
Notwithstanding accusations that COVID-19 escaped from a virology lab in
Wuhan, [China]{.underline} has [[emerged from the pandemic
looking]{.underline}]{.mark} much [[better than the
US]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [with]{.underline} its [**B**elt and
**R**oad **I**nitiative]{.underline} to finance infrastructure
development around the world, [it]{.underline} has [aggressively stepped
into the void left by US retrenchment]{.underline} during Donald Trump's
four-year presidency. **[China's [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}** may
very well **[look at the]{.underline}** current [**s**tatus **quo**
**and [conclude]{.mark}**]{.underline} that **[[they are on the
right]{.mark}]{.underline}** strategic **[[path]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Finally, **[[China and the US are deeply intertwined]{.mark}
economically]{.underline}**. Despite Trump's trade war, Sino-American
bilateral trade in 2020 was around \$650 billion, and [China was
[America's largest]{.mark} [trade partner]{.mark}]{.underline}. The two
countries' [[supply-chain linkages are vast]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[China holds more]{.mark} than \$1 trillion in US
[Treasuries]{.mark}]{.underline}, most of [[which it cannot]{.mark}
easily [unload]{.mark}]{.underline}, lest it reduce their value and
incur massive losses.

To be sure, logic can be undermined by a single act and its unintended
consequences. Something as simple as a miscommunication can escalate a
proxy war into an interstate conflagration. And as the situations in
Afghanistan and Iraq show, America's track record in war-torn countries
is not encouraging. China, meanwhile, has dramatically stepped up its
foreign interventions. Between its expansionist mentality, its growing
foreign-aid program, and rising nationalism at home, China could all too
easily launch a foreign intervention that might threaten US interests.

Cyber mischief, in particular, could undercut conventional military
command-and-control systems, forcing leaders into bad decisions if more
traditional options are no longer on the table. And Sino-American
economic ties may come to matter less than they used to, especially as
China moves from an export-led growth model to one based on domestic
consumption, and as two-way investment flows decline amid escalating
bilateral tensions.

[A "[mistake]{.mark}"]{.underline} on the part of either country
[[is]{.mark} always [possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is why
**[[diplomacy is essential]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Each country needs to
determine its vital national interests vis-à-vis the other, and both
need to consider the same question from the other's perspective. For
example, it may be hard to accept (and unpopular to say), but civil
rights within China might not be a vital US national interest. By the
same token, China should understand that the US does indeed have vital
interests in Taiwan.

[The US and China are destined to clash in many ways.]{.underline} But a
direct, **[interstate war need not be one of them]{.underline}**.

Relations at Boston University. The 'new Cold War' with China is Way
Overblown. Here's Why. 2/8/2019.

[Is a **[new Cold War]{.mark}** looming]{.underline} --- or already
present --- [between the **U**nited **S**tates and
**China**?]{.underline} Many analysts argue that a combination of
geopolitics, ideology and competing visions of "global order" are
driving the two countries toward emulating the Soviet-U.S. rivalry that
dominated world politics from 1947 through 1990.

But [such [concerns are **overblown**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here are
four big reasons why.

1\. The [historical backdrops of the]{.underline} two [relationships
are]{.underline} very [different]{.underline}

[When the Cold War began, the U.S.-Soviet relationship was
fragile]{.underline} and tenuous. Bilateral diplomatic relations were
barely a decade old, U.S. intervention in the Russian Revolution was a
recent memory, and the Soviet Union had called for the overthrow of
capitalist governments into the 1940s. Despite their Grand Alliance
against Nazi Germany, the two countries shared few meaningful
diplomatic, economic or institutional links.

[[In **2019**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the situation between the
**U**nited **S**tates and **China** is **very different**]{.underline}.
Since the 1970s, [[**diplomatic** interactions, **institutional ties**
and **economic flows**]{.mark} have all
**[exploded]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Although each]{.underline}]{.mark}
[side has **[criticized]{.mark} the other**]{.underline} for domestic
interference (such as U.S. demands for journalist access to Tibet and
China's espionage against U.S. corporations), [these [issues **did not
prevent coop**]{.mark}eration on a host of **other
issues**]{.underline}. [Yes, there were [tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}
over the past decade, [but these [occurred against a]{.mark} **generally
[cooperative]{.mark}** [backdrop]{.mark}]{.underline}.

2\. Geography and powers' nuclear postures suggest East Asia is more
stable than Cold War-era Europe

The Cold War was shaped by an intense arms race, nuclear posturing and
crises, especially in continental Europe. Given Europe's political
geography, the United States feared a "bolt from the blue" attack would
allow the Soviet Union to conquer the continent. Accordingly, the United
States prepared to defend Europe with conventional forces, and to deter
Soviet aggrandizement using nuclear weapons.

Unsurprisingly, the Soviet Union also feared that the United States
might attack and wanted to deter U.S. adventurism. Concerns that the
other superpower might use force and that crises could quickly escalate
colored Cold War politics.

Today, [the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and **China**
spend]{.mark} **proportionally [far less]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} their
[**militaries** than]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[and]{.mark} the [Soviet Union]{.mark} did]{.underline}. Though an arms
race may be emerging, [U.S. and Chinese [**nuclear postures** are
**not**]{.mark} nearly [as **large or
threatening**]{.mark}]{.underline}[: **[Arsenals]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[remain **far below** the **size and scope** witnessed in the Cold
War]{.underline}, and [[are **kept** at a **lower**]{.mark} state of
**[alert]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[As for **geography**]{.underline}, [**East [Asia]{.mark}** [is **not
primed** for **tensions**]{.mark} akin to those in Cold War
Europe]{.underline}. China can threaten to coerce its neighbors, but the
[**[water barriers]{.mark}** separating China from most of Asia's
strategically important states [make]{.mark} outright
**[conquest]{.mark}** significantly **[harder]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of
course, as scholars such as Caitlin Talmadge and Avery Goldstein note,
[crises may still erupt]{.underline}, and each side may face pressures
to escalate. Unlike the Cold War, [however, **U.S.-Chinese
[confrontations]{.mark}** [occur at **sea** with]{.mark} relatively
**[limited forces]{.mark}** and **[without]{.mark}** clear

suggests [there are **[countervailing factors]{.mark}** that may
[give]{.mark} the two sides **[room to negotiate]{.mark}**]{.underline}
--- [[and **limit**]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[speed]{.underline}]{.mark}** [with which a **[crisis
unfolds]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

3\. The Cold War had just two major powers

The Cold War took place in a bipolar system, with the United States and
Soviet Union uniquely powerful, compared with other nations. This
dynamic often pushed the United States and the U.S.S.R. toward
confrontation and contributed to more or less fixed alliances; moreover,
it encouraged efforts to suppress prospective great powers, such as
Germany.

In 2019, it's not at all clear we are back to bipolarity. Analysts
remain divided over whether the U.S. unipolar era is waning (or is
already over) --- and, if so, whether we are heading for a new period of
bipolarity, modern-day multipolarity or something else. Regardless, most
analysts accept that **[[other countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** will
play a central role [in East Asia]{.underline}n security affairs.

Russia, for example, still benefits from legacy military investments,
India is developing economically and militarily, and Japan is beginning
to build highly capable military forces to complement its
still-significant economic might. Even if these nations aren't as
powerful as the United States or China, their presence [[makes]{.mark}
for [more **fluid diplomatic arrangements**]{.mark} and more **diffuse
security concerns**]{.underline} than during the U.S.-Soviet
competition. The resulting security dynamics are therefore likely to
look very different.

4\. Ideology plays less of a role in U.S.-Chinese relations

Many people see the Cold War as an ideological contest between
U.S.-backed liberalism and Soviet-backed communism. But that's not the
whole story.

The early 20th century saw liberalism, communism and fascism vie for
ideological preeminence. With fascism defeated alongside Nazi Germany,
the postwar stage was set for a struggle between communism and
liberalism to reinforce the U.S.-Soviet contest. That each ideology
claimed universal scope ensured that the ideologies served as rallying
cries for Third World conflicts, which were subsequently associated with
the U.S.-Soviet struggle.

[The respective "**[ideologies]{.mark}**" of the **U**nited **S**tates
and **China** [do not favor]{.mark}]{.underline} this type of
**[[contest]{.underline}]{.mark}** today. Indeed, analysts calling for a
hard-line stance against China have faced difficulties even identifying
a coherent Chinese ideological alternative. And while some researchers
claim that a nascent ideological contest pitting an "autocratic" China
against the "liberal" United States is emerging, this narrative ignores
the political contests that shape Chinese politics (and have parallels
in U.S. politics). Autocracies and democracies often cooperate. And on
one important ideological issue --- how they organize their economic
lives --- [China and the **U**nited **S**tates have both **embraced**
economic **growth** via trade]{.underline}, [the private sector and
semi-free markets]{.underline}.

LESS RELEVANT REGION In response to the Iraq war, the United States has
aimed to reduce its role in the Middle East. Three factors have made
that course both more alluring and more possible. First, [inter[state
conflicts that]{.mark} **directly [threatened]{.mark}** [U.S.]{.mark}
interests]{.underline} in the past [[have]{.mark} **largely [been
replaced]{.mark}** [by **substate**]{.mark} **security
[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, **[[other]{.mark} rising
[regions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially Asia, [[have taken on more
importance]{.underline}]{.mark} to U.S. global strategy. And third,
[**the [diversification of]{.mark} global [energy]{.mark} markets** [has
weakened oil]{.mark} as a driver]{.underline} of U.S. policy. [[During
the Cold War, traditional]{.mark} state]{.underline}-based [[threats
pushed]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to play
**[a]{.mark} major [role]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Middle East. That
role involved not only ensuring the stable supply of energy to Western
markets but also working to prevent the spread of communist influence
and tamping down the Arab-Israeli conflict so as to help stabilize
friendly states. These [[efforts were]{.mark} **largely
[successful]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Beginning in the 1970s, the United
States nudged Egypt out of the pro-Soviet camp, oversaw the first
Arab-Israeli peace treaty, and solidified its hegemony in the region.
[Despite challenges]{.underline} from Iran after its 1979 revolution and
from Saddam Hussein's Iraq throughout the 1990s, [U.S. dominance was
never]{.underline} seriously [in question. The
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates

among]{.underline}]{.mark} the Gulf [[Arab states. Thanks to]{.mark}
**all [these]{.mark} efforts**, the [chances of]{.mark}]{.underline}
deliberate [interstate [war]{.mark} in the Middle East
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps [**[lower]{.mark} now** [than]{.mark}

**No Middle East war\-\--[deterrence]{.underline}.**

Helena **Cobban 19**, MA, Senior Fellow at the Center for International
Policy, 10-13-2019, \"Mutual Deterrence: Good for the Middle East, Bad
for the Nuclear Weapons Industry?\", LobeLog,
https://lobelog.com/mutual-deterrence-good-for-the-middle-east-bad-for-the-nuclear-weapons-industry/

Over the past three-plus months it has become increasingly clear that,
[despite the bombast that]{.underline} Pres. Donald [Trump has hurled
against]{.underline} the Islamic Republic of [Iran]{.underline} (along
with a full deck of extremely harmful sanctions and some cyber attacks),
[neither **he** nor his **closest regional allies**]{.underline} [in the
anti-Iran coalition have been **willing to escalate** to any military
attack against Iran that could **escalate to all-out war**]{.underline}.

[Might [the Mid]{.mark}dle [East]{.mark} now be [see]{.mark}ing the
emergence of]{.underline} a situation of [**[mutual
deterrence]{.underline}** [that could]{.underline}
**[bring]{.underline}**]{.mark} it some much-needed
**[[stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- and that could also put the
long-vaunted "value" of nuclear weapons into deep question?

Let's do a quick recap. On June 20, [[Iranian forces shot down a]{.mark}
large [U.S.]{.mark} Reaper Hawk [drone]{.mark}]{.underline} that had
almost certainly ventured into Iranian airspace. [[The military
reaction]{.mark} from the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[Saudi]{.underline} Arabia, [Israel]{.underline}, [and the
U]{.underline}nited [A]{.underline}rab [E]{.underline}mirates? As I
noted here a few weeks later: **[[goose egg]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Then
on September 14, either Iranian allies or [Iran]{.underline} itself
[launched a **large-scale**]{.underline}, stunningly intricate
**[attack]{.underline}** [against Saudi]{.underline} Arabia['s oil
complex]{.underline} at Abqaiq. **[More goose egg]{.underline}**.

Along the way, in late August, Israel killed two fighters affiliated
with Iran's Lebanese ally, [Hizbullah]{.underline}, in Syria and [sent
explosive drones]{.underline} [against]{.underline} two
Hizbullah-related [targets inside Lebanon]{.underline}. The Hizbullah
chief warned publicly that the organization would retaliate against
Israel. [Israel's response? Its military leaders organized a very
**public withdrawal**]{.underline} of their forces from a strip along
the country's northern border with Lebanon. Then, after Hizbullah indeed
launched a quick missile strike against an Israeli military vehicle
fleeing deeper into Israel, the [Israelis' only response was to shoot a
few pieces of **ordnance**]{.underline}, [seemingly at
**random**]{.underline}, [into **uninhabited parts** of southern
Lebanon.]{.underline}

In an analysis of the incident and its background that I published
September 5, I noted that, "[the situation of
**reciprocal**]{.underline} (if highly asymmetrical)
**[deterrence]{.underline}** [that has existed between Israel and
Hizbullah]{.underline} since ... 2006 **[remains in
place]{.underline}**."

Now, in the aftermath of the Abqaiq attacks, it is clearer than ever
that a situation of **[mutual]{.underline}** (if asymmetrical)
**[[deterrence exists]{.underline}]{.mark}** [not just between Israel
and Hizbullah]{.underline} over the Lebanon-Israel border,
[but]{.underline} also **[more [broadly in the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}** between Israel and Hizbullah's backers in
Iran.

In Israel, nuclear scientist Uzi Even recently assessed the capabilities
the Iranians or their allies revealed during the Abqaiq attack:

> [The Iranian technology is **reliable**]{.underline} and
> **[advanced]{.underline}**, and the Iranians are capable of producing
> and operating simultaneously a large number of drones and cruise
> missiles.

He argued that,

> Either the Saudi defense system failed or communication between the
> Iranian missiles was hidden and hard to discover. Either way, the
> attack was successful and effective... [The
> [Iran]{.mark}ians]{.underline}, or their proxies, [[showed]{.mark}
> that [they can **hit**]{.mark} **specific [targets]{.mark}** [with
> **great precision**]{.mark} and from a distance of **hundreds of
> kilometers**]{.underline}. We have to accept the fact that we are now
> vulnerable to such a strike. Yes, we can also carry out such strikes
> and perhaps inflict great damage on them, but so what? Does rational
> deterrence always work in the Middle East?

He also argued that,

> above all... operation of \[Israel's\] Dimona nuclear reactor should
> be halted. It has now been shown to be vulnerable, and the harm it
> could cause would likely exceed its benefits.

For the staunchly pro-war and pro-Israel New York Times columnist Thomas
Friedman, the main takeaway from Even's analysis was that:

> Israel has been signaling two things to Hezbollah and Iran. One is
> that in response to any missile attacks, Israel will carpet bomb
> neighborhoods in Lebanon where Hezbollah's families live and where it
> manufactures the missiles, and turn them into rubble, as it did on a
> small scale in 2006. And it will make the Lebanese economy collateral
> damage.
>
> And the other is that Israel will attack Tehran directly, either with
> precision long-range missiles from Israel or submarine-launched
> missiles from the Persian Gulf, with this message: "Every time Tel
> Aviv is hit by your proxies, we will hit Tehran. You will not sit out
> this war. And you will not out-crazy us."

Notably, neither of these "signals" seemed to be ones that Friedman
disagreed with, or had any problem with. But his analysis of the crucial
war that Hizbullah and Israel fought in 2006 also seemed badly askew:
the bombing that Israel carried out that year of the "neighborhoods in
Lebanon where Hizbullah's families live" --- and indeed, of numerous key
elements of the country's vital national infrastructure --- was
extremely far from "small-scale." It was truly monumental. Yet Hizbullah
not only survived it, it survived it with its standing in Lebanon's
political system significantly enhanced and with the Israeli ground
units that had attempted a broad invasion of the country racing back as
fast as they could to Israel with their tails between their legs.

[Hizbullah's performance in 2006 reaffirmed to all objective observers
that a situation of reciprocal]{.underline} (if asymmetrical)
[deterrence existed between it and Israel]{.underline} --- and it
achieved that by having only relatively "dumb" weapons at its command.
Friedman was right to warn that with the much smarter surveillance and
guidance systems now presumably at its command, Hizbullah's ability to
project targeted threats against vital Israeli infrastructure is almost
certainly much, much higher.

Friedman's conclusion was that the demonstrations that Iran and its
allies (whether in Lebanon, Yemen, or elsewhere) have given in the past
few months of the high level of their targeting and command-and-control
capabilities have made the Middle East a considerably more dangerous
place:

> [\[T\]he Middle East may look calm right now, but that's an
> illusion]{.underline}. Everyone is recalculating: The Iranians are
> emboldened, the Arabs are frightened and Israel and Iran are one
> miscalculation away from a war of precision missiles that neither can
> afford.

[I **question this conclusion**]{.underline}, which seems unthinkingly
Israelocentric. After all, [[for]{.mark} **40 years** of
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} US-Soviet [[Cold War]{.mark}, the situation of
**reciprocal deterrence** and]{.underline} "Mutually Assured
Destruction" (**[[MAD]{.underline}]{.mark}**) between the world's two
largest, nuclear-armed superpowers [[gave]{.mark} a measure of
**[strategic calm]{.mark}**]{.underline} to a world still reeling from
the two globe-girdling wars of the first half of the 20th century.
(True, there were lots of nations in the Global South that suffered in
that era.)

But [why would we think that [in the Mid]{.mark}dle
[East]{.mark}]{.underline} of the second quintile of the 21st century, a
[situation of **[Mutual Intraregional Deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(MID) [[would be]{.underline}]{.mark} any more
de**[[stabilizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** than the Cold War's MAD was at
the global level?

[Indeed, [the]{.mark} actual [situation of **being deterred** that
**Israel**]{.mark}, **[Saudi]{.mark}**]{.underline} Arabia, **[[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [and
the **UAE**]{.underline} [have **[all evinced]{.mark}** in recent
months]{.underline} --- [at the hands of]{.underline} the
non-nuclear-weapons state [Iran]{.underline} and its allies in the
region --- [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} the most
**[[intriguing]{.underline}]{.mark}** aspect of the current situation.
Bearing in mind that two of those powers, Israel and the United States
are both well-endowed nuclear powers, what does this tell us about the
utility of nuclear weapons in today's world? A subject for another
day...

**No Middle East war and no great power involvement**

[[**In contrast** to]{.underline}]{.mark} the 20th century and [[the
early]{.mark} years of the [21st century, the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[regional [crisis in the 2010s]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[developed]{.underline}]{.mark} at a time [[when]{.underline}]{.mark},
overall, [[the **role and leverage of major powers** external to the
Middle East, as]{.underline}]{.mark} either [active [meddlers or
security guarantors]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region, or both,
actually [**[declined]{.mark} rather than increased**. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [serves as the most evident
case in point]{.underline}: the "post-interventionist" US administration
has clearly become "tired of the Middle East", struggling and often
failing to keep pace with the dynamically changing situation and unable
to alter or decisively affect the course of events. [The same even more
strongly applies to the European powers]{.underline}. In terms of
activity and impact, **[regional actors]{.underline}** (Iran, Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, UAE and Turkey) increasingly [appeared to outplay
external powers and influence]{.underline}.

For external powers, however, that did not remove a number of risks and
threats connected to, or emanating from, the Middle East. The increase
and diversification of global energy supply and the latest crisis in
energy prices made the region less central to the global economy than it
had been in the past. At the same time, the fundamental socio-political,
statehood and security crisis in the Middle East brought with it new
security concerns and implications. They mostly stemmed from reinforced
perceptions about the long-term nature of regional instability, the
continuing potential for further destabilization, and the related
consequences and implications beyond the region, ranging from terrorist
connections to migration flows. These challenges affect external powers
unevenly. For instance, the role of the Iraq-Syria area as the main
focal point for global terrorism activity and magnet for transnational
flows of violent extremists in the mid-2010s poses a threat to everyone
(but mostly to the countries of the region itself, as well as to those
in Europe and Eurasia). In contrast, the avalanche of refugee and
migrant flows from the Middle East primarily targets Europe (rather than
North America, Eurasia, or other regions).

Until recently, [[the main]{.underline}]{.mark} type of
[[response]{.mark} by key]{.underline} (Western) [external powers to
turbulent developments in the Middle East]{.underline}, while not
amounting to a hands-off approach, [[boils down to **limited
containment**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Examples range from limited air
strikes against "Islamic State" positions in Iraq and Syria, carried out
by the US-led coalition since 2014, to the 2013 deal on Syria's chemical
disarmament co-brokered by the United States and Russia. Not
surprisingly, this limited-containment approach has had equally limited
results for Syria, Iraq and the region -- as well as for the West itself
(as shown, e.g., by the persistent migrant flows and accelerating
terrorist attacks in Europe). [[Despite the]{.mark} growing [centrality
of the Middle East to global politics]{.mark} and security]{.underline},
and its more direct impact on and ties to the West, [[this **damage
limitation** course]{.mark} taken by key external actors [has not
been]{.mark} very [different from]{.mark}]{.underline}, e.g., [[the
approach]{.mark} taken [by the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and its Western allies (and also by
[[Russia and China]{.mark}) [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark} problem in recent years.

Argument Finds No Takers," Carnegie Corporation of New York, 2-24-2016,
https://www.carnegie.org/news/articles/turkeys-article-5-argument-finds-no-takers/

The ferocity of the [fighting between Syria's]{.underline} government
[forces and]{.underline} various proxies vying for control of territory
and resources has [Turkey]{.underline} on edge and [has already led
to]{.underline} several [deadly clashes involving]{.underline} the only
[NATO]{.underline} member state bordering the civil war.

[With Turkey, Russia, Iran, Iraq, and Gulf states pursuing their
own]{.underline}, often [conflicting aims in Syria]{.underline}, all
against the backdrop of a U.S.-led air and commando campaign against the
Islamic State (IS), [there is]{.underline} renewed [concern at NATO's
headquarters]{.underline} in Brussels [that Turkey could see the next
flare-up as grounds for citing Article 5]{.underline}: in effect,
demanding that its NATO allies deploy forces and come to its collective
defense.

[Turkey has already invoked]{.underline} the lesser-known [Article
4]{.underline}---a demand for an emergency consultation of the
alliance---following the downing of a Turkish warplane under disputed
circumstances last spring. Incidents like this and the threat that
Bashar Assad's forces might launch Scud missiles into Turkey led NATO
members---the United States, Germany, and Spain---to deploy Patriot
anti-aircraft missiles along the border in early 2013, though the German
and American batteries have since been withdrawn. Spain's---a less
capable version of the Patriot---is geared towards anti-aircraft, as
opposed to anti-ballistic missile defense, and therefore deemed more
appropriate

[But [could a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[new]{.underline}**
[incident]{.underline}]{.mark}---a missile strike, an IS incursion, or
Syrian artillery bombardment across the border---[[bring
the]{.underline} **[full might of NATO into the war?]{.underline}**
[Many are]{.underline} **[skeptical]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and
[for]{.underline} **[good reason]{.underline}**.

[[The **history of invocations of**]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO's
[**[Article 5]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[short]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} somewhat [[**underwhelming**.
In]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[68 years]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the
North Atlantic alliance's history, [[plenty of
**low-intensity**]{.underline} [conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}
[involving NATO]{.underline} nations [[have raged]{.mark}, from
rebellion in France's Algerian departments, to the U.S. war in Vietnam,
through the Balkan wars of the 1990s. [Yet]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[only
once]{.underline}** [has]{.underline} **[Article
5's]{.underline}**]{.mark} "all-for-one, one-for-all" **[[facility been
invoked]{.underline}]{.mark}**: that was **[September]{.underline}** 12,
**[2001]{.underline}**, the day after the al-Qaida attacks on the United
States.

[[Even **then**]{.mark}, its effect [was primarily]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[symbolic]{.underline}**]{.mark}. While the United States expressed
its deep appreciation at the time, NATO involvement in Afghanistan would
be minimal for years to come, though British, French, and a handful of
other elite forces arrived as early as November that year. In practice,
though, it was not until late 2003, when NATO assumed command of the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), that alliance troops
arrived in force, and even then often under restrictive rules of
engagement that limited their effectiveness.

Indeed, ISAF, the force NATO led from August 2003 to December 2013, was
a UN-sanctioned operation that included not only forces from NATO's 28
militaries but troops and specialists from 48 states, including such
disparate contributors as Mongolia, Tonga, and Singapore. At its height
in 2010--11, ISAF numbered more than 42,000 troops, augmenting 100,000
U.S. troops.

[[Turkey would]{.underline} **[sorely like]{.underline}** [a
commitment]{.underline}]{.mark} of that scale. [[Yet]{.mark}
the]{.underline} subtle **[[diplomatic realities]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[of the North Atlantic alliance---as well as the very unsubtle nature of
its own activity inside Syria---[make this]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[highly unlikely]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

For one thing, [[Turkey's]{.underline} **[own
military]{.underline}**]{.mark} has [[acted
aggressively]{.underline}]{.mark} in [targeting]{.underline} Syria's
[Kurdish rebels]{.underline}, the People's Protection Units, or YPG,
which Ankara views as little more than a proxy for the outlawed
separatist guerrillas of the Turkish Kurds, the Kurdistan Workers'
Party, or PKK. Last week, [the Turks [opened up on]{.mark} the
Kurdish-held air base at]{.underline} [**[Aleppo]{.mark}**, in spite of
the fact that the city]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
**[surrounded]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} forces loyal to
**[Assad]{.underline}**, the presumed enemy in Syria. [The
act]{.underline} **[[enraged]{.underline}]{.mark}** almost
**[[everyone]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Russia demanded at an emergency
Security Council meeting a censure of Turkey's violation of Syrian
sovereignty, and President Obama, who regards the Kurdish as the most
reliable ground force in the fight against the IS, urged Turkish
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in an 80-minute phone call on February 19
to avoid provocative actions.

[[While NATO has taken no]{.underline} **[official]{.underline}**
[position]{.underline}]{.mark} [on the question of Article 5---[**not
surprising**, since **no**]{.mark}]{.underline} formal
[**[request]{.underline}** [has been made---through]{.underline} **[back
channels]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the alliance [has
been]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[telegraphing]{.underline}**
[a]{.underline} **[resounding "no" to Turkey]{.underline}**]{.mark} for
weeks. Last week, [Luxembourg's Foreign Minister]{.underline} Jean
Asselborn [told]{.underline} Germany's [DerSpiegel that "NATO
**cannot**]{.underline} [allow itself to be pulled into a military
escalation with Russia as a result of the recent tensions between Russia
and Turkey]{.underline}."

Whatever the fate of the current U.S.-push to secure a cease fire,
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[large [NATO ground
force]{.mark}]{.underline}**, of the kind that deployed to Bosnia,
Kosovo, and Afghanistan, [[is **not** on the table]{.underline}.]{.mark}

**[Especially]{.underline} if war was [provoked by

invoking]{.underline} Article 5 by clarifying through
[backchannels]{.underline} that illegal aggression does not require

Erdogan's move under NATO's Article 5 --]{.underline} **[only in
theory]{.underline}**, however.

**[Not unexpectedly]{.underline}**, EU foreign ministers were unable to
agree on a collective arms embargo against Turkey due to the invasion of
Syria at their meeting in Luxembourg. The necessary unanimity was not
achieved, several countries, especially Hungary, opposed the motion.

Instead, the EU states solely committed to "strong national positions
with regard to their arms exports to Turkey". Based on EU criteria that
the stability of the region should not be endangered. What it amounts to
is yet another display of a European Union divided on a message and
utterly powerless on the actual matter.

Whether or not an arms embargo could have had an actual impact or had
been political posturing in the first place, can certainly be debated.
What cannot be debated any longer is that Turkey continues to advance
its troops in Syria. Furthermore, while the ceasefire announced today
has only delayed the issue, it is hard to believe that Erdogan will
suddenly concede his grand strategy quest for a neo-Ottoman Empire.

As for the Europeans, Turkey's actions so far carry more than just
humanitarian connotation. [A potential **attack on Turkey** by the
**Syrian army** of allied actors in the conflict could lead to Turkey
**invoking NATO's Article 5**]{.underline} -- collective self-defence.
Under Article 5, an attack against a NATO member is considered an attack
against all, and so far, has only been utilised once in the Treaty's
history.

[Nevertheless, [invoking Article 5 does not]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[automatically]{.underline}** [warrant]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[unconditional [support]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the member states.
[Turkey [would have to invoke]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[Article
4]{.underline}** [first]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Under Article 4, any
member]{.underline} state [can]{.underline} **[convene]{.underline}** [a
meeting [with]{.mark} the [other members to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**["consult".]{.underline}**]{.mark} [Here, [Turkey
would]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[have to make a
case]{.underline}**]{.mark} [for why it feels that either its
independence or security is in jeopardy.]{.underline}

**[[Even in this scenario]{.mark},]{.underline}** however, [[chances
of]{.mark} Erdogan's [proceeding to]{.mark} the **next level (i.e.
[Article 5) seem inconceivable]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and
there are valid reasons for it.

First, [[the]{.underline} **[vast majority of
NATO]{.underline}**]{.mark} countries [have]{.underline}
**[already]{.underline}** [[called on Ankara to]{.underline} **[retreat
immediately]{.underline}**]{.mark} after the invasion began. [Besides,
[several]{.mark} NATO states]{.underline} timely [[pointed out
the]{.mark} possible [**dangers** of destabilisation]{.mark} of the
entire region]{.underline}. **[Germany, the Netherlands and
France]{.underline}** [have]{.underline} temporarily **[stopped selling
arms]{.underline}** to Turkey [in]{.underline}
**[protest]{.underline}**, with Merkel and French President Emmanuel
Macron condemning the Turkish invasion as an attack. Also, NATO
Secretary-General Jens **[Stoltenberg]{.underline}**
[stated]{.underline} last week [he expects Turkey to act with
restraint.]{.underline}

Second, [for Article 5 to be invoked,]{.underline}
[**[attack]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[defence]{.underline}**]{.mark} action [[need to be]{.underline}
**[distinguished cleanly]{.underline}**. **[All]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[NATO states [must]{.mark}, therefore, [regard]{.mark} the [military
actions of **Turkey**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Syria [[as]{.underline}
**[lawful]{.underline}**]{.mark} under international law -- [[which
is]{.underline}]{.mark} reasonably **[[unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark}**
also, particularly [after the remarks that have been made and the rules
laid out for self-defence under the Charta of the United Nations,
Chapter VII, Article 51.]{.underline}

[Considering these factors, [the necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[unanimity]{.underline}**]{.mark} [for collective self-defence
[appears]{.mark}]{.underline} to be **[[highly unlikely]{.mark} in
almost any scenario]{.underline}**. In fact, [due to the international
community's resentment towards Turkey, a **freeze of Turkey's NATO
membership**]{.underline} [seems more conceivable than other NATO
members taking Turkey's side on the battlefield.]{.underline}

DOD and the Department of State (DOS) have shared responsibility for
engaging with foreign partner militaries since the mid-twentieth
century, with the bulk of congressional security assistance funding
allocated to DOS. [**Any security [assistance]{.mark}** [*administered*

activity]{.underline}.21 After the terrorist attacks on September 11,
2001, the legal framework for the funding and administration of such
activities evolved in response to emerging threats. Congress
increasingly granted funding and authorities directly to DOD under Title
10 for security cooperation.22 Therefore, while DOS security assistance
programs can include DIB components, the majority of DIB-specific
programming is currently funded under and implemented by the Department
of Defense and is thus considered security cooperation.

[[Security cooperation is]{.underline}]{.mark} a compilation of
[financial, educational, and material [resources]{.mark},
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} at their foundation [[are supported by
the]{.mark} United States]{.underline}, in particular the
[[D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense]{.underline}, and are
used to support the peaceful development of democracies in foreign
countries. The [[resources provided by the Department of Defense]{.mark}
are available to foreign countries after the host nation]{.underline}
requests the peaceful assistance of the U.S. military in response to
systemic deficiencies in the bureaucratic management of a nation state
or when a nation state [recognizes that its military limitations prevent
it from properly defending its geographic borders]{.underline}. The host
nation's request for support from the U.S. is typically an effort by the
foreign country to develop its internal capacity to protect its people
and limit internal or external threats. The security cooperation
exercise Baltic Operation, held in Estonia, is an example of a foreign
country using the resources 9 provided by the United States to improve
its national defense capabilities in direct response to a perceived
threat to its sovereign borders. In this scenario Estonia is attempting
to develop its military capabilities and project an image of strength in
an effort to maintain the freedom it earned, from Russia, at the
conclusion of the Singing Revolution in 1992 and prevent a future
Russian incursion across its borders. [In contrast to this appropriate
use and definition of security cooperation]{.underline} as a strategy to
prevent conflict, the [Obama]{.underline} Administration [is using the
term security cooperation]{.underline} as a way [to]{.underline}
[define]{.underline} a national [exit]{.underline} strategy from a two
front war, a strategy that at its heart is based on the reconstruction
of a damaged infrastructure. [The false labeling of]{.underline}
reconstruction operations as [security cooperation is the foci of this
thesis project]{.underline}.

[Introduction to [Security Cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}

Introduction

[The term security cooperation [was]{.mark} first [introduced]{.mark} in
1997 [by the Defense Reform Initiative]{.mark}]{.underline} (DRI). At
that time, the then named Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA)
already had day to day management responsibilities of many security
assistance programs authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and
the Armed Export Control Act (AECA). The DRI proposed that DSAA also
manage certain Department of Defense (DoD) funded international programs
along with their personnel and associated resources. So that other U.S.
government (USG) agencies, the private sector and foreign governments
could better understand DSAA's enlarged mission and diverse functions
beyond security assistance (SA), DoD re-designated DSAA as the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) effective 1 October 1998.

In recent years, DSCA has absorbed management responsibilities for many
DoD international programs. In addition, DSCA leads the broader USG
security cooperation enterprise. However, many security cooperation
programs continue to be managed by other elements of the Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD), the combatant commands (CCMDs) or the
military departments (MILDEPs). What further complicated the management
of security cooperation was that the in-country point of contact between
the USG and the host nation generally is either the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA) sponsored defense attaché office (DAO) or the DSCA
sponsored security cooperation office (SCO). These two spigots for
security cooperation with a country required a broad knowledge and skill
baseline of the very different international programs that are
initiated, funded, and managed throughout the DoD and its agencies and
the MILDEPs. Most disconnects regarding SCO-DAO coordination of
in-country security cooperation were generally resolved with the
establishment of the Senior Defense Official-Defense Attaché (SDO/DATT)
having oversight over both the SCO and DAO organizations. It was not
until 9 June 2004 that [DoD published a [formal]{.mark}]{.underline},
yet still very broad, [[definition of security
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} in Joint Pub 1-02:

> [[All DoD interactions]{.mark} with foreign defense establishments [to
> build defense relationships]{.mark}]{.underline} that promote specific
> U.S. security interests, develop allied and friendly military
> capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and
> provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to a host
> nation.

[DODD 5132.03]{.underline}, DoD Policy and Responsibilities Relating to
Security Cooperation, 29 December 2016, [further defines security
cooperation with assigned responsibilities]{.underline}:

> [All DoD interactions with foreign defense establishments to build
> defense relationships]{.underline} that promote specific U.S. security
> interests, develop allied and partner nation military and security
> capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and
> provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to allied
> and partner nations. This includes DoD administered security
> assistance programs.

**The most [clear and specific]{.underline} definition conclusively
requires the DoD**

**Reighard 6**, Lt Col in USAF (Robert, "SECURITY COOPERATION:
INTEGRATING STRATEGIES TO SECURE NATIONAL GOALS," USAWC STRATEGY
RESEARCH PROJECT, https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA449543.pdf)//BB

[Security cooperation has been a part of the U.S. Armed Forces for many
years]{.underline}. In fact, historians reveal that [the U.S. military
has always engaged in security cooperation with other countries and
their military forces]{.underline}. [However, [the term]{.mark} used to
designate such activities is now "[Security Cooperation]{.mark}," a term
that [has evolved]{.mark} conceptually]{.underline} through various
programs over the years. [During the 1990s, the terms "engagement" and
"shaping" were used without]{.underline} sufficient
[specificity]{.underline}; they were often used interchangeably,
[resulting in confusion]{.underline} that led to problems in both
planning and execution. [DOD thus adopted "Security Cooperation" in
2001. It included a broad range of military-to-military
activities]{.underline}, but it also clarified roles and
responsibilities. [The term Security [Cooperation]{.mark} thus
[describes]{.mark}]{.underline} a broad range of [[activities]{.mark}
used [by the D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f
[D]{.mark}efense]{.underline} in peacetime operations. These activities
refer to all DOD interactions that are [[carried out with foreign
defense establishments]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as combined exercises,
combined training, combined education, military-to-military contacts,
humanitarian assistance, and information operations.

**[Budget classification]{.underline} proves it's military-to-military**

**Van Eerden 20**, Captain (James, "Seeking Alpha in the Security
Cooperation Enterprise A New Approach to Assessments and Evaluations,"
Journal of Advanced Military Studies, 11.1)//BB

[The]{.underline} Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 [President's Budget: Security
Cooperation]{.underline} Consolidated [Budget]{.underline} [Display
outlines seven categories of security cooperation]{.underline} activity,
including [military-to-military engagements]{.underline}, [support to
operations]{.underline}, and [humanitarian and assistance activities,
among others]{.underline}.6 The [security cooperation]{.underline}
[framework traditionally includes]{.underline} [security
assistance]{.underline} (SA), [security force assistance]{.underline}
(SFA), [and]{.underline} some aspects of [foreign internal
defense]{.underline} (FID).7 In the context of this article, [[the term
security cooperation refers]{.underline}]{.mark} primarily [[to
military-to-military engagement]{.underline}]{.mark}s, [where the U.S.
military engages in training partner forces under the auspices of Title
10 and Title 22 authorities]{.underline}.

**Even the broadest definitions require the DoD**

**Williams 12**, Lt Col in Army National Guard (James, "The National
Guard State Partnership Program: Element of Smart Power,"
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA562110.pdf>)//BB

Similarly, the six Geographic Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) have
underscored security cooperation and building partner capacity as
essential to their respective Theater Strategy Plans and Country
Campaign Plans in support of National Security objectives. In every
COCOM posture statement the reader will find references 7 to the
importance of the concepts of cooperation, engagement, and building
partner capacity. ["[S]{.mark}ecurity [C]{.mark}ooperation]{.underline}"
[[is defined broadly]{.mark} as interactions between the Department of
Defense and foreign militaries that promote specific United States
security interests; develop allied and friendly military capabilities;
and provide the United States with both peacetime and contingency access
to host nations]{.underline}.12 [Typical]{.mark} [security]{.underline}
[cooperation]{.underline} and engagement [[activities include]{.mark}
military-to-military contact, coalition training, [nation assistance and
long term op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. These types of
activities range from Navy ship port visits to combined training
exercises, foreign military education, leader conferences, foreign
military sales and counter-drug operations.

**Security Cooperation requires a [military branch]{.underline} to be
the implementing agency**

**Arnold 20**, colonel in USAF (Jason, "Add Value to Security
Cooperation through Joint Unification," FAO Journal of International
Affairs,
<https://faoajournal.substack.com/p/add-value-to-security-cooperation?s=r)//BB>

[In]{.underline} the [Security Cooperation]{.underline} Enterprise, [the
[military]{.mark} departments loom large a[s the]{.mark}]{.underline}
primary [[implementing agencies]{.mark} of]{.underline} Foreign Military
Sales ([FMS]{.underline}) cases, Building Partner Capacity
([BPC]{.underline}) cases, [and]{.underline} in [training]{.underline}
activities.\[6\] These SC programs provide our international partners
with the capabilities they require both for their own security and to
assist in regional security objectives that improve the overall global
security situation. Most open [[SC cases have]{.mark} one of [the
military department]{.mark}s [as]{.mark} an [Implementing
Agency]{.mark}]{.underline} (IA) [and each service has built its own
organizational structure, bureaucracy, and automated systems to support
the effort]{.underline}.\[7\]

**[SC\-\--Prefer Our Interp\-\--2NC]{.underline}**

**Given that basically [any]{.underline} activity is included, the [only
functional limit]{.underline} on the topic must come at the
[agent-level]{.underline}**

**Mazarr 22**, senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation.
Previously he worked at the U.S. National War College, where he was
professor and associate dean of academics; as president of the Henry L.
Stimson Center; senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies; senior defense aide on Capitol Hill; and as a
special assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Michael,
"Security Cooperation in a Strategic Competition," RAND,
<https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA650-1.html>)

To pursue this analysis, we first had to define the bounds of what we
would assess. [[Official]{.mark} U.S. government [definitions of
s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation [are]{.mark} very
[broad]{.mark}.]{.underline} [One definition]{.underline} from the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency [states that security
cooperation]{.underline}

> [comprises all activities undertaken by]{.underline} the Department of
> Defense ([DoD) to encourage and enable international partners to work
> with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates to achieve strategic
> objectives. [It includes [all]{.mark} DoD interactions with foreign
> defense and security establishments,]{.underline} including all
> DoD-administered Security Assistance (SA) programs, that build defense
> and security relationships; promote specific U.S. security interests,
> including all international armaments cooperation activities and SA
> activities; develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
> self-defense and multinational operations; and provide U.S. forces
> with peacetime and contingency access to host nations.3

[Such definitions clearly [include]{.mark} almost [any security-related
activity for any purpose]{.mark}.]{.underline} To scope the focus of the
study, [we reviewed]{.underline} official state documents and strategies
and the literature on security cooperation to identify [11 types of
activities]{.underline}:

1\. [military aid]{.underline}, which includes funding through the
Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, the Excess Defense Articles
program, and other grants and loans

2\. [arms sales]{.underline} and transfers,4 such as U.S. arms sales
through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales
(DCS) programs

3\. [military capacity-building]{.underline}, such as U.S. activities
under Section 1206 of the annual National Defense Authorization Act and
Sections and 2282 and 333 of U.S. Code, Title 10 (the train and equip
authority)

4\. [education and training]{.underline}, including international
military education and training (IMET), professional military education
(PME), and regional centers

5\. [personnel exchanges]{.underline}, such as U.S. activities under the
Military Personnel Exchange Program and the State Partnership Program

6[. military exercises]{.underline}, both bilateral and multilateral and
those that involve foreign partners

7\. [access-related agreements]{.underline}, such as status of forces
agreements (SOFAs) and agreements related to base access and
information-sharing

8\. [armament-related agreements]{.underline}, such as those for
co-development of systems and for research, development, test, and
evaluation activities

9\. [sustainment of donor-nation equipment]{.underline} by the donor,
the partner, or third parties

10\. [institutional capacity--building]{.underline} to strengthen the
partner institutions that support security services

11\. [humanitarian assistance and disaster relief]{.underline} (HA/DR),
which offers support for efforts to relieve suffering.

These categories offered a consistent template for gathering data across
our various study components. [A major challenge was that [reliable and
consistent data on]{.mark} each of [the]{.mark} 11 [categories]{.mark}
[were not available]{.mark}]{.underline} for all the competitors---not
even for the United States. Especially at the unclassified level,
[[there is simply no comprehensive roster of security cooperation
activities]{.underline}]{.mark} by the United States, and neither China
nor Russia publishes inclusive data sets of its programs. An additional
challenge was that, in some cases, the different countries define the
categories somewhat differently, so we could not develop data on
entirely comparable sets of security cooperation activities.
