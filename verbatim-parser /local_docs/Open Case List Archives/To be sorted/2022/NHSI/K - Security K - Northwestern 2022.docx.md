Since the 2008 financial crash, [the world has witnessed an
**unprecedented outbreak** of social **protest** in every major
continent.]{.underline} Beginning with the birth of the Occupy movement
in the US and Western Europe, and the Arab Spring, the eruption of
[civil unrest has continued to wreak havoc unpredictably]{.underline}
from Greece to Ukraine, from China to Thailand, from Brazil to Turkey,
and beyond. In some regions, [civil [unrest has coalesced in]{.mark}to
the **collapse**]{.underline} [of incumbent governments or even the
eruption of a [prolonged]{.mark} state of internecine
**[war]{.mark}fare**]{.underline}, as is happening in Iraq-Syria and
Ukraine Crimea. To what extent is this apparent heightening of
geopolitical instability new? ¶ Increasing public dissatisfaction with
government is correlated with continued government difficulties in
meeting public expectations. Yet while [[policymakers]{.mark} and media
observers]{.underline} have raced to keep up with events, they [have
largely [miss]{.mark}ed [the **deeper causes**]{.mark} of this new **age
of unrest**]{.underline}---the end of the age of cheap fossil fuels, and
its multiplying consequences for economic growth, industrial food
production, and the Earth's climate stability. ¶ Contrary to widely
reported claims across mainstream media of a new era of prosperity
heralded by the US-led shale oil and gas boom, [the proliferation of
contemporary climate, food and economic crises have at their root a
single common denominator: the fundamental and permanent disruption in
the energy basis of industrial civilization]{.underline}. ¶ [This
inevitable energy transition away from high quality fossil fuels to
lower quality, **more expensive energy** forms]{.underline}---which will
be completed well before the close of this century, and quite possibly
much earlier---[will force a **paradigm shift**]{.underline} in the
organization of civilization. [The twenty-first century]{.underline}, in
this context, [is a pivotal one for humanity as industrial civilization
pivots through a process of **systemic transition**]{.underline}, driven
by the complex interplay between human societies and biophysical
realities. ¶ Yet [for this shift to result in [a viable]{.mark} new [way
of life will require a **fundamental epistemological shift**]{.mark}
recognizing humanity's embeddedness in the natural world.]{.underline}
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [[cannot be achieved without
breaking]{.mark} the stranglehold of [conventional models achieved
through]{.mark} the **[hegemony of establishment
narratives]{.mark}**]{.underline}---dominated by fossil fuel interests
and the banality of the mainstream media news cycle.¶ The central thesis
of this study is that the escalation of social protest and political
instability around the world is causally related to the unstoppable
thermodynamics of global hydrocarbon energy decline and its
interconnected environmental and economic consequences. It offers, in
this sense, a biophysical approach to international relations, and
argues that [geopolitics remains fundamentally embedded in biophysical
processes. This is not to reduce geopolitics to the
biophysical]{.underline}---far from it---[but to recognize that the
dynamics of the geopolitical cannot be dislocated from the dynamics of
the biophysical, and that biophysical processes are increasingly
**driving geopolitical instability** to a degree
unrecognized]{.underline} by policymakers, the media, as well as social
and natural scientists.¶ Hydrocarbon energy decline can be understood as
consisting of the following two intertwined processes: the inexorable
reduction in industrial civilization's production of net energy from
hydrocarbon sources (fossil fuels) over the last decades; the
acceleration of hydrocarbon energy production to attempt to make-up for
this decline and sustain economic growth.¶ This process has in turn had
two major consequences, namely: climate change and the corresponding
destabilization of the Earth System due to the increasing quantity of
greenhouse gas emissions due to hydrocarbon energy dependence; and the
permanent slowdown of global economic growth due to the increasing costs
of energy production relative to GDP. [[Climate and economic crises
are]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [acting as **[amplifying
feedbacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the process of hydrocarbon energy
decline, [and in themselves are [acting]{.mark} synergistically [to
undermine]{.mark} global industrial food [production while]{.mark}
simultaneously [impinging on]{.mark} **socio-political
[stability]{.mark}** and human well-being]{.underline}.¶ [While
[conventional]{.mark} policy and media [approaches]{.mark} to
socio-political instability tend to [focus]{.mark} almost purely [on
'surface']{.mark} social
[symptoms]{.mark}]{.underline}---**[[geopolitical
competition]{.underline}]{.mark}**, political corruption, **[[economic
mismanagement]{.underline}]{.mark}**, ideological extremism, and so
on---[the [deeper]{.mark} biophysical **systemic
[drivers]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of instability [are]{.mark} largely
**ignored** or **[misunderstood]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As such,
[missing from the vast bulk of conventional wisdom on escalating
socio-political instability]{.underline} around the world [is the
crucial recognition of its **central cause** in a systemic process of
hydrocarbon energy decline and concomitant civilizational
transition]{.underline} toward an inevitable post-carbon future.¶
Currently, climate change is rightly and consensually recognized by the
scientific community and has been accepted at least in principle by
policymakers as a reality requiring an urgent collective response from
human societies. However, despite growing recognition of the
interconnected nature of these crises---illustrated through concepts
such as the food-water-energy nexus---[there remains a fundamental
failure in the conceptualization of their interconnected nature in terms
of the relationship between human societies and the biophysical
environment, and]{.underline} relatedly, [the relationship between human
polities and the biophysical environment.]{.underline}¶ [[This]{.mark}
**root [failure]{.mark}** of conceptualization [is]{.mark} perhaps [the
**most significant factor**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[focusing on
the role of **human agency**]{.underline} [in [driving]{.mark} the
current convergence of [global crises]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
[failure is compounded]{.mark} by the necessarily compartmentalized
nature of scientific specialization, which has produced a vast volume of
information, but little in the way of]{.underline} **[epistemological
mechanisms]{.underline}** [to integrate that into knowledge across
disciplinary boundaries]{.underline}. [It is further compounded
[by]{.mark} the **[transmission of incorrect]{.mark} conceptual
[diagnoses of global crises]{.mark}**]{.underline} [through the global
mainstream media. The perpetual [transmission of **false**]{.mark} and
**inaccurate [knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on the origins]{.mark}
and dynamic [of]{.mark} global [crises has created a situation in
which]{.mark} as such **[crises accelerate]{.mark}**, [the human
species]{.mark} as a whole [is]{.mark} disempowered from being able to
correctly understand these crises]{.underline} and their symptoms, [and
thus **[unable to solve them]{.mark}**]{.underline}.¶ [Yet to diagnose
the intensifying perfect storm]{.underline} of climate, energy and
economic crises [requires a fundamental reconceptualization of their
true nature as symptoms of an overall civilizational system which,
increasingly, cannot be sustained]{.underline} by the biophysical
environment.¶ This study offers an empirically-grounded social
scientific theoretical framework for developing a holistic approach to
this perfect storm through the lens of what this author has called the
'Crisis of Civilization' (as opposed to a 'clash of civilizations'). My
approach is not to create yet another new statistical model to add to
the plethora of models that exist, but to strike at a deeper lacuna
within the discipline of international relations---to create the
beginnings of an accurate, integrated transdisciplinary theoretical
basis for such modelling, derived from a holistic analysis of the
relevant empirical data.¶ The study is divided into two main sections.
The first consists of a general framework of the broad crises that this
author considers to be integral to the biophysical processes driving
geopolitical instability today. The second consists of a series of case
studies which provide specific empirical data supporting and building on
this general framework to test how and whether they are indeed acting
out on local, national and regional levels as is my hypothesis. This
opening section begins by building on this author's previous work on the
'Crisis of Civilization' as an overarching analytical framework for the
integrated examination of global climate, energy, food, economic and
socio-political crises (Ahmed 2010 , 2011 ). This is achieved by
establishing the inherent systemic interconnections between these crises
on a global macro-level scale. The monograph then proceeds to explore
how the general framework of biophysical factors aka the 'Crisis of
Civilization' plays out at a micro-level within specific countries in
key regions---the Middle East, Africa, Europe, South Asia, and North
America. This examination takes us to the crux of my argument and
provides specific evidence that the biophysical processes discussed more
generally in the opening are, in fact, already having concrete
geopolitical impacts accelerating the destabilization of human societies
across the world, in a manner that can now be detected through a
holistic and transdisciplinary empirical analysis. This not only
provides surprising empirical vindication for our hypothesis that
biophysical processes are playing an integral causal role in the
intensification of political and geopolitical disruption on a global
scale, it also provides us a basis to explore some tentative
business-as-usual (BAU) forecasts.¶ This permits further exploration of
the intersection between the thermodynamics of escalating hydrocarbon
energy decline and the accelerating disruption of global industrial
civilization. As prevailing social, political and economic structures
become increasingly dysfunctional against the strain of hydrocarbon
energy decline, the resulting rupture manifests in an increasing
frequency of social protest and violent conflict.¶ Part of this study,
then, identifies how [conventional governmental,]{.underline} industry
[and media narratives of these crises for the most part **fail to
accurately understand them**]{.underline}, not just due to a lack of a
holistic-systemic frameworks for examining these crises as
interdependent---but [due to a fundamental epistemological failure that
has allowed mythological 'theories' of human progress in the form of
neoclassical and neoliberal economics to become entrenched as the
dominant cognitive paradigm.]{.underline} The most powerful hegemonic
component of this ideological capture of human collective cognition
occurs through the global institutions associated with the mainstream
media. The principal problem here is a highly compromised ownership and
editorial structure that ties media outlets to the very prevailing
structures of fossil fuel-centric power complicit in global crisis
acceleration. The preponderance of fossil fuel-centric interests in
[[conventional media]{.mark} ownership [has led to]{.mark} consistently
[**inaccurate reporting** on]{.mark} energy issues]{.underline}, and
[their relationships with economic, food and climate crises, as well as
**specific [conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.¶ Yet to some extent, and
compounding the insular ideological approach of powerful government,
industry and media institutions, there has been a similar failure from
amongst experts in different fields of these crises, who have been
unable to develop theoretical, conceptual and empirical frameworks to
view their specialized data in its inherent interconnections with data
from other fields. In other words, a lack of generalized systems
training in our schools. Due to this problem, we are beginning to grasp
only recently the extent to which geopolitical ruptures that overwhelm
of the news of the day have been exacerbated by a convergence of crises
studied largely separately in these disparate fields. There is,
therefore, little understanding of how energy and resource depletion
tangibly impact the political economies of different societies, and how
these processes interact with the local impacts of global processes like
climate change.¶ [This has led to a **knowledge
deficit**]{.underline}---specifically, a whole systems knowledge deficit
comprising a paucity of reliable, actionable knowledge in the
mainstream, [[exacerbating]{.mark} a sense of **public [apathy and
confusion]{.mark}**, and cementing a policymaking impasse among
political leaders who remain subject to a fatal combination]{.underline}
of intensive fossil fuel lobbying and media misinformation.¶ Among the
most critical solutions to the 'Crisis of Civilization', then, is a
concerted grassroots mobilization to rectify the whole systems knowledge
deficit. This could be achieved in many different ways---whether through
responsible journalism or more informed policy formulation based on the
effective communication of interdisciplinary scientific research---but
[[the]{.mark} end [goal is]{.mark}]{.underline} the same: **[mass
[public education]{.mark}]{.underline}** [with a view to catalyze social
action [that is]{.mark} **systemically
[transformative]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Without]{.mark} addressing the
[knowledge]{.mark} deficit, [the]{.mark} **self-reinforcing
[cycle]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} amplifying [crisis]{.mark} feedbacks
**[cannot be overturned]{.mark}**.]{.underline}¶ It is hoped that this
study can begin contributing to addressing the whole systems knowledge
deficit by firstly, establishing a scientifically-grounded systems
theory framework for integrating data from different fields for the
study of international politics; secondly, beginning the process of
recognizing major geopolitical ruptures in the context of systemic
crises driven by biophysical processes; thirdly, outlining the basis for
a major, urgent new transdisciplinary research program bringing together
the natural and social sciences to develop a holistic
theoretical-empirical model of global crisis convergence; which in turn
can pave the way for a fourth major, urgent new transdisciplinary
action-research program on mitigating the impact of global crisis
convergence, while transitioning human civilization to new more viable
political economic structures that subsist in parity with their
biophysical contexts. ¶ Chapter 2 The Crisis of Civilization as an
Analytical Framework ¶ 2.1 The Human-Environment System as a Complex
Adaptive System¶ The idea of a 'Crisis of Civilization' pivots around
the goal of understanding human activity as a whole. It is premised on
the fact that as a single biological species, human beings share common
individual and social characteristics through which they interact with
each other, with other species, and with the biophysical environment.¶
Global civilization constitutes the full mechanism of social
organization by which this nexus of activities and interactions
operates. I use a 'Crisis of Civilization' framework to examine
multiple, seemingly disparate global and local crises. This does not
obviate the specific and distinctive dynamics of those crises but
permits examination of how these crises interrelate with one another in
the context of the overarching global system of which they are part.¶
The theorization of human civilization as a "complex adaptive system"
derives from the application of complex systems theory as developed in
relation to biological systems and ecosystems (Kauffmann; Dyke;
Homer-Dixon; Diamond). A rich and dense literature demonstrates that
complex systems are found across the natural sciences in physics,
chemistry, and biology (Ross and Arkin 2009), as well as in ecology (May
et al. 2008) and economics (Farmer et al. 2012 ).¶ A system exists
whenever a plurality of entities subsists in which each entity functions
in some sort of relationship with the others. A complex system exists
when the relations between these parts leads the system as a whole to
display emergent properties and behavior which cannot be reduced solely
to the nature of its different parts and their relationships. Those
emergent properties can be codifi ed as overarching rules that
characterize the system's structure as a whole. In some cases this can
be done mathematically, although this is a less useful approach when
examining human societies. ¶ A complex adaptive system exists when the
system as a whole is able to adapt--- to generate a collective shift in
its internal behavior in order to survive. Thus, while the relations
between parts of a system generates the emergent structures that
comprise the system as a whole, those relationships are, in turn,
restrained and enabled by those wider structures. This circular
relationship is integral to the system's capacity to adapt to new
environmental conditions. In time this is done by evolution; more
immediately this can be done by behavioral changes or species shifts. ¶
Equally, due to the nested and interconnected nature of the components
of a complex adaptive system, small perturbations in one part can have
ramifying effects on other parts of the system, depending on how they
are connected. This sort of internal positive feedback process means
that the overall structure of a system can be greatly impacted by
seemingly random occurrences---those structures can either be reinforced
or undermined by these internal feedback processes. ¶ When such internal
feedback processes reach certain thresholds, or 'tipping points', they
can induce fundamental re-ordering of key structures in the system as a
whole---the convergence of multiple tipping points, in turn, can
generate a systemwide adaptive cycle of re-structuring, a 'phase shift',
through which the system undergoes a transition to a new equilibrium
(Holling 2001 ). ¶ The human-environment system is complex and adaptive
because it represents a historically evolving civilizational form
comprised of a vast interlocking array of nested sub-systems, including
some from the earth's geology, resources, oceans, and atmosphere;
multiple living and non-living ecosystems across these domains; and
human systems, comprised of psychological, cultural and ideological fi
elds, relations of production and associated modes of energy extraction,
technological and economic systems, and political structures. ¶ Thus,
the 'Crisis of Civilization' framework is a systems approach that
attempts to analyze the complex interrelationships between multiple
global crises and human activities as a whole, thus understanding them
not simply as discrete crises and activities in themselves, but as
component factors of a wider global human environmental system with its
own emergent properties and behaviors. ¶ This approach recognizes that
each of these crises pertains to a specifi c subsystem in itself, with
distinctive features and patterns of behavior, but equally recognizes
that each of these sub-systems do not exist in isolation. Rather, their
mutual interrelationship generates emergent patterns characterizing the
system as a whole. Those emergent structural features, in turn, exert
causal regulatory effects that shape, enable and constrain the behaviors
of the sub-systems. ¶ A systems approach thus views particular crises
and associated human activities as discrete sub-systems which are,
nevertheless, inherently interconnected as subsystems in an emergent
human-environmental system, captured through the concept of a
world-scale human civilization. It is in this respect that the 'Crisis
of Civilization' as an analytical framework is able to systemically
locate multiple crises as interconnected features of a wider world-scale
crisis in human civilization as an emergent macro-structure. By
integrating detailed trans-disciplinary examination of crisis
sub-systems with analysis of their systemic interconnections within the
world-scale human-environment system, a much clearer picture of the
precise drivers, dynamics and potential trajectories of these crises is
possible. This permits discernment of a birds-eye perspective of overall
civilizational structures and their emergent direction. ¶ Examining
human civilization as a complex adaptive system, therefore, permits
multiple global crises to be understood through the lens of a range of
powerful concepts with solid empirical basis in the biophysical
sciences---the thresholds and tipping points of feedback processes; how
interconnections between different crises can generate amplifying
feedbacks with the potential to accelerate the breaching of tipping
points; the extent to which different crises can be seen as properly
systemic--- that is, related fundamentally to the key global structures
integral to the prevailing dynamic of human civilization; and how these
crises relate to the system's adaptive capacity, in particular, whether
they are generating a major 'phase change' in the system itself. ¶ In
particular, this allows analysis of human civilization to return to a
scientific framework defied by the thermodynamics of the fossil fuel
system, and the evolution and adaptation of species, bringing in
critical insights from the physical and natural sciences that can inform
the development of robust historical and sociological theories. ¶ 2.2
The Energy Metabolism of Human Civilization ¶ Applications of complex
systems approaches to social, environmental and economic phenomena have
largely neglected the most fundamental factor in the evolution and
adaptation of complex systems: energy metabolism. ¶ Extensive research
in the biological and ecological sciences demonstrates that an
organism's relation to the environment is mediated fundamentally through
the mode and manner by which it extracts energy from the environment, to
maintain and improve its distance from thermodynamic equilibrium. Living
systems extract free energy from the sun, store it, and use it. Further,
they can reproduce as well as collect, process, and exchange information
in order to control and direct energy and matter they receive from their
environments (Terzis and Arp 2011 ; Hall et al. 1992 ). ¶ According to
the Second Law of Thermodynamics, physical systems display a tendency to
dissipate energy and thus transition from states of order to increasing
disorder. Therefore, physicist Erwin Schrödinger defined a living system
as an embodiment of "negative entropy" as they "extract order" from
their environments to survive, adapt and evolve. (Schrodinger 1944 ) ¶ A
living system or organism is thus defined by its ability to store energy
under energy fl ow, before dissipation. It develops, maintains and
reproduces, or renews, itself by mobilizing material and energy
extracted from the environment, which is stored internally through
cyclic non-dissipative processes coupled to irreversible dissipative
processes. This permits the organism to survive precisely through the
consumption and ordering of energy within systemic biological processes
organized through genetic information protocols. The capacity to
extract, store and mobilize stored energy is therefore integral to a
reproducing life cycle. Eventually, of course, the energy must be
irreversibly dissipated as required by the Second Law. But the
increasing complexity of a living system is related directly to its
capacity to extract, store and mobilize stored energy, and to thereby
stave off the thermodynamic dissipation of energy. (Ho 1999) ¶ Organisms
which successfully adapt to changing or challenging environmental
conditions do so through the superior processing of information about
those external conditions through genetic modification, reflecting
increased efficiencies in energy extraction, storage and mobilization in
relationship with the environment. (Schneider and Kay 1994 ) ¶ The
thermodynamics of living systems applies, of course, not just to any
single individual organism, but simultaneously to collections of
organisms inhabiting specific environments. While human beings are the
most advanced---that is, complex--- biological organisms known to
science, human civilization constitutes a complex adaptive system which
has been able to maximize energy extraction, storage and mobilization
from its environment far more efficiently and powerfully than ever
before. The astonishing complexity of human civilization is related
directly to its capacity to harness energy from the environment through
numerous sub-systemic processes of social organization, thus maintaining
increasing distance from thermodynamic equilibrium (Odum 1994). ¶ This
framework allows for a more complete empirically-grounded theorization
of what the contemporary escalation of global environmental and economic
crises entails for the current trajectory of human civilization. Over
its historical evolution, human civilization has demonstrated a
relationship with its environment involving escalating energy use and
energy dissipation, with wide-ranging consequences for the stability of
the global human-environment system. ¶ Social power is an organic
constitution grounded in an exploitative relationship with nature by
which energy is extracted from natural resources, transformed into a
commodity (through production) and eventually consumed. Energy is thus
the very condition of production---but to examine the fl uctuating
relationship between the two requires the recognition of social power
through property : that is, the way access to land, resources and
technology to enable energy production is mediated through property
rights, which in turn are related to confi gurations of class (Wood 1981
; Aston et al. 1987 ; Rioux and Dufour 2008 ). ¶ It is therefore
necessary, in examining the energy trajectory of human civilization as a
whole, to investigate inequalities in social power and class in the
context of differentiated access to land, resources and technology
between various human groups, and how this relates to the thermodynamics
of energy as applied to human society as a complex adaptive system. This
will enable us to properly grasp the processes of extraction,
transformation and consumption of energy through labor, and varying
relationships between society, labor, technology and natural resources,
that are integral to diagnosing human civilization's current predicament
(Foster et al. 2010 ; Hall and Klitgaard 2012 ). ¶ The historical
development of human civilization illustrates an accelerating trend in
global net energy production driven by a series of increasingly
sophisticated technological breakthroughs, each linked to fundamental
shifts in the humanenvironment relations and corresponding
socio-political and economic systems of organization. These
civilizational phase-shifts toward more complex forms can be
conceptualized in multiple overlapping ways. ¶ These phase-shifts have
encompassed fundamental transitions in the energy metabolism of human
societies---in terms of both the types of energy extracted, and the
relations of production by which this energy is extracted, stored and
mobilized in society through the creation of goods and services. These
energy sources include our own muscle and that of animals, as well as
wood, wind, water, coal, oil, and nuclear power (LePoire et al. 2015 ).
The relations of production accompanying these phase shifts have
included the following social-property relations: huntergatherer,
nomadic, pastoral, agrarian, feudalism, slavery, agrarian capitalism,
industrial capitalism, and neoliberal fi nance capitalism, which is
rapidly moving to a new phase of late capitalism predominated by
information technology and artifi cial intelligence (Ahmed 2009 ). ¶ It
is also important to note that each new phase-shift does not necessarily
constitute a clean break with previous shifts, but in the course of
increasing complexity often builds on or incorporates older structures
within a new, wider structural context. One useful way of understanding
this process in an evolutionary fashion is through Arthur Koestler's
concept of nested self-organizing hierarchical systems which
successively incorporate less complex systems to create higher scales of
overarching complexity (Pichler 1999 ). ¶ While the latest phase shift
of neoliberal fi nance capitalism has been able to generate an
unprecedented level of wealth within the system, it has simultaneously
developed an unprecedented degree of global inequality between the
core---consisting of a transnational nexus of class power centred in the
former G8---dominating the world's productive resources including
energy, raw materials, military and information technology; and the
periphery---whose countries remains largely subordinated to the global
structures institutionalized by the core (Ahmed 2009 ; Tainter 1990 ). ¶
2.3 The Physics of System Failure ¶ Today, human civilization under late
capitalism maintains its increasing distance from thermodynamic
equilibrium via the throughput of vast quantities of increasingly
depleted fossil fuel reserves, along with other fi nite and increasingly
scarce resources such as metal ores, radionucleotides, rare earth
elements, phosphate fertilizer, arable land, and fresh water (Nekola et
al. 2013 ). ¶ One indicator of the system's growing complexity today is
the measure of material throughput, or economic growth---Gross Domestic
Product (GDP). Under capitalist social-property relations, GDP must
continuously increase through the maximization of private sector profi
ts, simply for businesses to survive in the competitive marketplace and
for the economy to maintain its ability to meet the consumption
requirements of a growing population. However, as the complexity of
human civilization has advanced, the continual growth in material
throughput is correlated with an escalating rate of depletion of energy
and raw materials, as well as an acceleration in the dissipation of
energy through intensifying greenhouse gas emissions. ¶ Robust scientifi
c assessments now demonstrate that the continuation of those biophysical
processes of environmental degradation in a business-as-usual scenario
will, before the end of the twenty-fi rst century, fundamentally
undermine the biophysical basis of human civilization in its current
mode of material organization and structural complexity. Further, the
uncontrolled energy releases generated by these biophysical processes
are manifested in climate change, extreme weather events, and natural
disasters (Earth System Disruption); and drives geopolitical
competition, social unrest, and violent confl ict (Human System
Destabilization). ¶ These manifestations of dissipative energy release
can be seen as distinctive feedback processes resulting from human
civilization's accelerating exploitation of fossil fuel energy sources
within the context of the biophysical limits of the environment. In
turn, these two strands of systemic feedbacks---Earth System Disruption
(ESD) and Human System Destabilization (HSD)---are occurring within a
single, overarching human-environment system, and thus are already
inherently interconnected, therefore feeding back into each other. ¶
[[This]{.mark} mutual feedback process [creates an amplifying]{.mark}
global systemic [feedback]{.mark} in [which]{.mark}]{.underline}: (1)
ESD drives HSD, which in turn [[generates 'security' issues perceived
through]{.mark} the lens of '**[threat' and 'risk'
analysis]{.mark}**;]{.underline} (2) [[this invites traditional
securitized]{.mark} human [responses]{.mark} that focus on the
**expansion of existing military, political and economic
power**]{.underline} [to stabilize existing structures of authority and
advance prevailing mechanisms]{.underline} of energy extraction and
mobilization; (3) [the entrenchment and expansion of existing structures
undermines human civilization's capacity to pursue **structural
modifications**]{.underline} [to ameliorate, mitigate or
prevent]{.underline} \[[Earth Systems Disruption]{.underline}\] ESD,
thus intensifying ESD; (4) the feedback process continues as ESD drives
further \[Human System Destabilization\] HSD. ¶ [[The trajectory]{.mark}
of this amplifying global systemic feedback, carried to its logical
conclusion and assuming no intervening shift, [is]{.mark} simply the
[protracted, **cascading collapse of human
civilization**]{.mark}]{.underline} in its current form toward
increasingly less complex, and therefore less resource-intensive
configurations, corresponding to available resources and constrained
within the environmental limits imposed by accelerating climate change
(Tainter 1990).

[Underlying Russia\'s rejection of "**the West**" and]{.underline} the
[deteriorating **relations**]{.underline} between these two political
entities in recent years, there [lie **multiple drivers**]{.underline}.
Russian domestic politics and the changing approach of the Kremlin are
at the heart of many explanations (Grigas 2016; McFaul 2018; Taylor
2018). Other accounts emphasize how deteriorating Russia--West relations
are somehow the result of a mutual process (Legvold 2014; Mearsheimer
2014; Charap and Colton 2017; Conradi 2017; Monaghan 2019). [This
article]{.underline} can be placed in the latter school; it [shows
how]{.underline} what some call [the "**new Cold War**"]{.underline} has
[developed out of interaction between **Russia** and the **West**,
bringing]{.underline} these political [entities into a **relation**
where]{.underline} the threat of [**war** appears imminent]{.underline}.
It does so by investigating the dyad of Russia--West relations, which
was particularly benign and where military hostilities seemed highly
unlikely for twenty-five years following the end of the Cold War.

Focusing on the changing relations between Norway and Russia, I show how
[rising tension spread from]{.underline} the [**2014** crises in
**Ukraine**]{.underline} to the North.1 Initially, both [parties
declared]{.underline} that [they neither wanted nor
believed]{.underline} that the new strategic [tension between **Russia**
and the **West** would **spread**]{.underline} to or define relations in
this region. This was not surprising. Norway and Russia had managed to
build a close and practical partnership in the North following the end
of the Cold War. Relations in the region had been characterized as
pervaded by a spirit of cooperation and a "culture of compromise"
(Hønneland and Jensen 2015). [However, by]{.underline} October [2018,
NATO was conducting "**Trident Juncture**," the **largest military
exercise** since the **Cold War**]{.underline} on Norwegian territory,
[with twenty-nine **NATO countries** **participating**,]{.underline} as
well as Finland and Sweden, [involving **50,000 troops**]{.underline} in
all.2 While this exercise was underway, [Russia]{.underline}
unexpectedly [announced]{.underline} that [it would conduct **missile
tests**]{.underline} in the Norwegian Sea simultaneously.3 [Few could
deny]{.underline} that the new [Russia--West tensions]{.underline} had
[spread to the North]{.underline}. Although the Norwegian authorities
were reluctant to identify Russia as a "threat" for an entire year after
the annexation of Crimea, today they openly speak of and prepare for
hostilities. Russia, for its part, recently claimed that Norway has
become "the frontier of deterrence of Russia" in the policy plans of the
United States and NATO.4

[This]{.underline} development [will be explained with reference to
changing]{.underline} Russian and Norwegian
**[representations]{.underline}** of each other[: toward construing the
**other**]{.underline} part [more as a **threat** than a **partner** in
**one issue-area**, the rippling]{.underline} outward [of this
representation to **other**]{.underline} issue-[**areas**, the policy
changes **effectuated in line** with]{.underline} these **[shifting
representations]{.underline}**, and how these changes have been
(re-)acted upon by the other side. [Within]{.underline} such a process
of **[mutual]{.underline}** and multifaceted [**securitization**,
attention to **domestic audiences**, quests for **internal unity**, and
coherent **identity articulation**]{.underline} in volatile times [send
signals of **offense** and **non-recognition** across the **border** to
the **foreign state audience**---playing into a **mutual blame
game**]{.underline}, shaping interaction, [and]{.underline} further
[**escalating tensions** to the point where]{.underline} the threat of
[**hostilities** seem]{.underline}s **[imminent]{.underline}**. As long
acknowledged by security-dilemma theorists, both the classical realist
and newer constructivist proponents, interaction has a dynamics of its
own (Herz 1950; Jervis 1978; Mitzen 2006; Booth and Wheeler 2008). I
argue that [the]{.underline} emerging and [mutual pattern of
representing the **other** as a **threat**]{.underline}, not only in the
military sphere, but also across issue-areas, [has become
a]{.underline}n "autonomous" [**driver** of **conflict**---regardless of
whether]{.underline} either side (Norway/**[NATO]{.underline}**/West,
[and]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**) [might]{.underline}
originally [have had **offensive designs** on the other]{.underline}.5

By invoking the new Cold War in this article, I do not intend to measure
the level of threat and distribution of power between the parties or
suggest that these are the same as in the old Cold War. This article
does not speak to the recent discussion on the similarities and
differences between the old and the new Cold Wars (Legvold 2016; Lieven
2018). Rather, [I]{.underline} put the [spotlight]{.underline} on the
[mutual]{.underline} and evolving [**social identification** processes
between **political entities** that]{.underline} can help to [push a
**relation** to the point where]{.underline} an outbreak of
[**hostilities** seems **imminent**. Just as during the **Cold War**,
the parties]{.underline} today [hold]{.underline} increasingly and
[mutually incompatible descriptions of **self** and
**other**]{.underline} (Ringmar 2002) [and focus on blaming each
other]{.underline} (Legvold 2016). I believe [the]{.underline}
totalizing "**[blame game]{.underline}**" now [underway]{.underline} and
the mutual and intensifying descriptions of the other, [metastasizing to
a level where the other stands out as an "**existential
threat**"]{.underline} at every encounter, [are central to
understanding]{.underline} the unlikely return of **[high military
tension]{.underline}** in the North.

[Drawing on]{.underline} a detailed study of Russian and Norwegian
official texts in the years following the annexation of Crimea in 2014,
and applying a discourse-theoretical approach to [**securitization
theory**, this article offers two]{.underline} theoretical
[contributions to]{.underline} second-generation **[securitization
theory]{.underline}** post-Copenhagen School (Balzacq 2005; Stritzel
2007; McDonald 2008; Salter 2008; Floyd 2010; Hagmann 2015; Wilhelmsen
2017; Stengel 2019, building on Wæver 1994 and 1996; Buzan et al. 1998).
[**First**, I propose]{.underline} that [securitization processes should
be understood]{.underline} and studied [in **dyads** because the shift
to]{.underline} more [**radical representations** of the
**other**---i.e., a **higher degree** of
**securitization**---]{.underline}often [unfolds in a **mutual
pattern**]{.underline} of identification and interaction [between
**political entities**. **Second**, an **issue-specific**
securitization]{.underline}---say, representing the other part as an
existential threat in the military domain---[may **spread** to other
**dimensions** of the relationship, making the other]{.underline} part
[appear as **different** and **dangerous**]{.underline} at every
encounter. [Such]{.underline} multifaceted [securitization can intensify
a **negative spiral**]{.underline}, ultimately [blocking]{.underline}
the [chances for **positive**]{.underline} mutual
**[representation]{.underline}** and recognition. Military means then
become a logical and legitimate way of relating to the other: contact
and collaboration in other issue-areas are precluded. With this
approach, [I]{.underline} seek to [expand on]{.underline} and integrate
a discourse-theoretical version of [securitization theory]{.underline}
in[to]{.underline} the [study]{.underline} of how and [why **relations**
escalate to]{.underline} the brink of **[war]{.underline}**.

Although the post-positivist foundation of [this study]{.underline}
complicates direct communication and compatibility with much of the
classical literature on the security dilemma and spirals, it [does speak
to the]{.underline} central [**question** of how]{.underline} collective
actors, such as [states]{.underline}, [become unsure of whether the
**other** has **defensive** or **offensive intentions** and why
they]{.underline} come to [see and act toward each other as
**aggressive**, regardless of the "**true intentions**" of the
other]{.underline} (see e.g., Jervis 2001; Mitzen and Schweller 2011).
The positivist literature on the security dilemma and spirals usually
theorizes such pathways to conflict as an encounter between actors
reasoning through preference structures in rational games, or a set of
games (Jervis 1978; Fearon 1995; Mearsheimer 2001; Glaser 2010; Copeland
2011; Mitzen and Schweller 2011). In contrast, [my approach, building on
the]{.underline} fundamental [insight that political entities are
**socially constituted** and that the **identity** of
**self**]{.underline} and [other is subject to **change** through
**linguistic practices**, theorizes]{.underline} such [**pathways** to
**conflict** as emerging through]{.underline} many encounters and
[gradually changing **relations** where **identity dynamics** serve as
the **causal engine.**]{.underline}

This article proceeds as follows: I first lay out the theoretical and
methodological underpinnings of the argument, building on
second-generation securitization theory and the concept of ontological
security. Then, after a short presentation of the historical background
of Russia--Norway relations in the North, I turn to changing Russian and
Norwegian mutual representations in 2014--2018, and the shapes taken by
the securitizing narratives on both sides. Investigating the Norwegian
side in depth, I show how [the image of Russia as a
**threat**]{.underline} has [solidified **over time**, spilling over
into **non-security issue-areas**, and made]{.underline} a string of
[initiatives that reject Russia' **logical** and **legitimate
policies**]{.underline} in a new Norwegian approach. I examine how
Norwegian official securitization of Russia has been driven by the quest
for unity and continuity in representations of the self in a time of
uncertainty and disruption. The fifth section concerns this driver and
the unintended consequences of skewed attention to internal cohesion and
domestic audiences at the expense of Russia. I point out how [Russia has
**interpreted** and **(re-)acted** to]{.underline} Norway\'s
[securitizing moves and policies, showing how **mutual**]{.underline}
and multifaceted [**securitization** unfolds in **practice**---and
results in **escalation**]{.underline}.

Studying Escalation through Mutual and Multifaceted Securitization

[While some hold]{.underline} that the growing [**rhetoric** of
confrontation between **Russia** and the **West** can be employed
without]{.underline} running [the **risk of war**]{.underline} (Lieven
2018)[, I take this **use of words seriously**. Political
language]{.underline} serves to [make]{.underline} some [courses of
action **legitimate** and **logical**, while **precluding
others**]{.underline} (Hansen 2006, 21; Jackson 2006; Wilhelmsen 2017).
According to this fundamental discourse-theoretical insight,
[**securitization**---]{.underline}defined as [a process where the
**other** is]{.underline} increasingly [cast as **different** and
**dangerous** to the self---will manifest]{.underline} itself [in
**concrete policy practices**]{.underline} (Hagmann 2015, 9; Hayes 2009,
985; Wilhelmsen 2017, 28--29). Thus, [there is a link between the
**rhetoric** of **confrontation** that produces]{.underline} the
[subjectivities of **threatened self** and **threatening other**,
and]{.underline} the [policy responses initiated in]{.underline} the
course of [such a **securitization**]{.underline}.6 [The more
**different**]{.underline} and dangerous to the self [the other is
construed as **being**, perhaps even to the level of "**existential
threat**," the more **reasonable** and **logical** will the **use of
force** against this other **appear**]{.underline} (Bandura 1990, 7--8;
Wilhelmsen 2017, 24--26).

Securitization, viewed through a discourse-theoretical lens, emerges
through a plethora of utterings and is, therefore, best theorized as a
gradual process, not one specific happening (Ciuta 2009; Hagmann 2015,
21--22; Wilhelmsen 2017, 21--24). That is not to say that
securitizations cannot end up in a radical black/white juxtaposition,
where They represent an existential threat to US and can be related to
only through the barrel of a gun. Indeed, the aim of this article is
precisely to show how the gradual and increasing securitization of
Russia in Norway, and of Norway in Russia, is bringing relations to a
point where the threat of hostilities seems imminent. But there is no
necessary evolution to this point of possible destruction: it is a
contingent process (Guzzini 2011). When securitization is produced
through a myriad of statements that together make the other stand out as
a threat, there is always a possibility for more and more statements
that construe the other as "defensive" or even "potential partner" to
feed into the process, bringing the threat image a few levels down and
making possible a policy of restraint or even collaboration. Here,
however, I seek to identify mechanisms that push securitization upward
to the point where the buildup of force seems necessary and hostilities
imminent.

[My **first suggestion** is to conceptualize]{.underline} and study
[securitization processes in **dyads**,]{.underline} that is, [as a
**mutual process**. The shift to]{.underline} more [**radical
representations** of the **other**]{.underline} (a higher degree of
securitization) often [occurs in a **reciprocal pattern** of
**identification** and **interaction** between **political
entities**]{.underline} (Wilhelmsen 2020, 30). [How **political
entities**]{.underline} such as states identify, [**talk** to (or
**about**) each other, and]{.underline} the [policies]{.underline} they
launch in accordance with and [**following** such speech]{.underline},
play into and [shape the **speech** and **policy courses** of other
**states**]{.underline}. There are essential effects of securitization
processes where the other party is cast as different and dangerous to
the self (Wæver 1995; Buzan et al. 1998; Stritzel 2007; McDonald 2008;
Hagmann 2015; Wilhelmsen 2016). Within a dyad of political entities that
increasingly identify the other as a threat to the self, a
self-perpetuating logic sets in, with the two **[securitizations
fuel]{.underline}**ing **[each other.]{.underline}**

Under what conditions and how does this happen? As noted by Mitzen
(2006) and others, [states do seek]{.underline} not [only **physical
security**, they also seek security of the **self** (**ontological
security**)]{.underline}, mainly [because agency requires a stable
cognitive environment]{.underline}.7 [Particularly at a **time** of
**crisis** states strive to create]{.underline} continuous
[**narratives** of **self**]{.underline} (Steely 2008a; Zarakol 2010;
Subotic 2016). Routinized [**security talk** and]{.underline} the
[projection of the **other** as]{.underline} a [**threat** delivers
**ontological** security. It creates **inner cohesion**]{.underline} in
the referent group and the ability to act (Wilhelmsen 2017, 27--32).
This is [because representations of **self** and **other**
are]{.underline} bound together, [**dependent** on **each
other**]{.underline}. Collective identities and the social groups they
refer to are constituted in relation to difference and maintained
through the continued juxtaposition and drawing up of boundaries between
self and other (Barth 1969; Connolly 1991). However, [securitizing the
other]{.underline} for enteric use also [creates a "**securitization
dilemma**"---"a **difficult choice** where a **securitizing** move
represents a powerful]{.underline} and attractive opportunity for
political mobilization, but [with the **danger** of **perverse** and
**unintended consequences**]{.underline}" (Van Rythoven (2019, 2). The
unintended consequences of securitization have been suggested to be of
several kinds: contextual, social, and temporal (Van Rythoven 2019, 10).
Within the social type of contingency, which concerns how an audience
can interpret a security claim in unexpected ways, much attention has
been given to situations in which a securitizing move can be rejected by
the audiences it is meant to mobilize (Wæver 1989,1; Collins 2014; Van
Rythoven 2019). [Of particular relevance]{.underline} for relations
between political entities, but less investigated, [is the **unintended
consequences** that a securitization within one **political entity** of
another **political entity** may have on that other **political
entity**]{.underline}.

[To maintain **ontological security**, actors]{.underline} must not only
be able to assure themselves of who they are (endogenously)---and
protecting a continuous narrative of self becomes particularly pressing
in a time of crisis---but they [also need to be **identified** and
**recognized by others**]{.underline}, and on their own preferred terms
(exogenously) (Steely 2008b, 51--52; Zarakol 2010, 3; Ringmar 2014). [A
securitizing actor\'s **firm**]{.underline} (but probably unconscious)
[**attention** to ontological security]{.underline} and the domestic
audience [at a **time of crisis can** communicate **non-recognition** to
the **other**]{.underline} (foreign) [**audience**. If both
parties]{.underline} in a dyad of political entities [push
securitization of the other]{.underline} upward for enteric use [but
disregard how the **other** will **interpret it**, as well as the
**non-recognition** of the **other party**]{.underline} that such
securitization implies[, a **negative spiral** sets in]{.underline}.

For example, [a securitization of **NATO** as **different** and
**dangerous** to Russia creates]{.underline} both [**inner cohesion**
in]{.underline} the [Russia]{.underline}n polity [and makes
possible]{.underline} a policy of "**[military
modernization]{.underline}**" [and]{.underline} a posture of
"**[defensive deterrence]{.underline}**," b[ut it can have **unintended
consequences**. It can be]{.underline} taken as [a **rejection** of
NATO\'s **self-constituted identity** as a **legitimate**, **reliable**,
security-seeking actor and elicit]{.underline} a string of
[representations of Russia as **different** and **dangerous** on the
**NATO side**]{.underline}.8 Failure to be recognized by the other on
one\'s own preferred terms might not necessarily result in feelings of
inferiority and shame, triggering efforts to reconstruct one\'s own
identity, as Bially Mattern has suggested (2004, 12--13) or "progressive
change" of self to become like the other, as Ringmar (2014) holds. As
Lupovici (2012, 818) notes [a collective actor that experiences
**ontological threat** can "redefine the situation]{.underline} in order
[to protect **identity**." "**Avoidance**,"]{.underline} he says,
building on Giddens (1991, 188) "[allows an actor facing]{.underline} an
**[ontological dissonance]{.underline}** [to revalidate its identity
rather than to change it]{.underline} or to change its behaviour."
Lupovici explores the strategy of avoidance in situations where
dissonance is created endogenously, between conflicting
self-identifications and the responses undertaken to offset threats to
these self-identifications within one political entity.

Avoidance may play out differently when the ontological dissonance
emerges exogenously in a dyad of political entities. To reduce the
dissonance between the understanding of self and the explicit
identification of one\'s own political entity by the other as being
something different and dangerous, revalidation of own identity can be
achieved through externalization, by simply returning the negative
identification. This strategy is manifest as a clear pattern in the
texts by Norwegian/Western and Russian leaders studied below. [It is
**hardly surprising** that a collective actor would respond
to]{.underline} the **[non-recognition]{.underline}** implicit [in being
securitized with **externalization** in]{.underline} the form of
[**talking** and **hitting back** instead of undertaking]{.underline}
some form of [internal revision. Responding by mirroring]{.underline}
the **[securitization]{.underline}** of your group by the other party
[can be **rewarding** in]{.underline} terms of delineating and
[maintaining **self-identity**]{.underline}, particularly [in a **time
of crisis**]{.underline}. To restate and return to the case in focus:
the [non-recognition]{.underline} implicit [in Russia\'s
**securitization** of **NATO** can elicit]{.underline} highly
[antagonistic representations of **Russia** from the **NATO side**,
triggering another round of **representations** and **accusations** from
the **Russian** side, and so on]{.underline}.

[Such a **negative spiral**]{.underline} of mutual representations and
accusations [can be driven **further** when]{.underline} the different
[non-military issue-areas]{.underline} in which collective political
entities engage also [become subject to **securitization**]{.underline}.
While relations between such entities usually take place on different
international arenas addressing different issue-areas and exhibit a
mixed pattern of friendly and hostile interaction (Jervis 2001, 37;
Bially Mattern 2004), they may become subject to patterned
all-encompassing friendly or [hostile interaction]{.underline}. The
latter, I propose, [can happen when **security concerns** take
center-stage]{.underline} in relations, [through a **spillover** from
**mutual securitization**]{.underline} in the military sphere [into
**other arenas**]{.underline} of potentially neutral or friendly
interaction, [such as **trade**, **culture**, or]{.underline} even
**[diplomacy]{.underline}**.

In more scholarly terms, [a **negative spiral**]{.underline} in
relations [is intensified when the other is
**securitized**]{.underline}, i.e., construed, [through **speech**, as
different and **dangerous** at **every encounter**, and when every
**policy**]{.underline} move [in any **issue**-**area** is]{.underline}
represented as [a **tool** in the hands of this **threatening
other**]{.underline}. Such multifaceted [securitization]{.underline}
pushes the representation of the other upward on the scale of difference
and danger and [can create a situation where **positive recognition** is
not granted in **any sphere**]{.underline}. In this situation, the
collective actor experiences an exogenous rejection of its self-ascribed
identity in every policy sphere where it seeks outside
confirmation---making the experience acute. In turn, this experience of
[acute **ontological dissonance** may be met by]{.underline} a strategy
of [**avoidance** and **externalization**: a **counter-securitization**
that mirrors and matches]{.underline} the near-total
**[rejection]{.underline}** to which the political entity itself has
been subjected. [In the course of the **ensuing spat**, with hostile
representations flung **back** and **forth**]{.underline} on every arena
of encounter[, the other is]{.underline} finally [left with **no face**
but that of an **enemy**. That resolves]{.underline} the dilemma of
[knowing what the **intentions** of the **other**]{.underline} are[, as
each party is]{.underline} now quite [certain]{.underline} that [the
other has **offensive designs**]{.underline}.

[From this understanding, logically flow]{.underline} policies of
[**positioning** and **armament** in the **military sphere**, and
**disengagement** and **non-communication** in non-military
**issue-areas**]{.underline}. In contrast to endogenously generated
avoidance noted by Lupovici (2012, 813), the problem is not that a
collective actor undertakes contradictory measures to alleviate
ontological dissonance, but rather that [the same measures of
**disengagement** and **confrontation**]{.underline} [seem logical and
**legitimate**]{.underline} i[n every sphere]{.underline} of interaction
[between **two political entities**]{.underline}. In this situation,
[the parties have few possibilities of extricating]{.underline}
[themselves from the **spiral** that leads to
**confrontation**]{.underline}. If the other is securitized and denied
recognition across issue-areas and arenas, that leaves no space for
responding with friendship to overcome mistrust---which would be the
opening through which to start pushing the spiral downward.

A high level of [mutual]{.underline} and multifaceted [securitization
can produce]{.underline}, in Jervis' terminology (2001, 41), [a "**deep
security dilemma**"]{.underline} \... ["a situation where **mistrust**
cannot be **overcome**"]{.underline} and where there are "no missed
opportunities for radically improving relations." But in contrast to
Jervis' conception, [the road toward this]{.underline} high level of
**[mutual securitization]{.underline}**, with the ensuing minimal trust,
[is **gradual** and **contingent**, and produced through]{.underline} a
plethora of **[representations]{.underline}**. Moreover, in this
approach, [the key "**mover**" in the **security
dilemma**]{.underline}---the perception of each party that the other has
offensive intentions---[emerges from]{.underline} their [**discursive
practices**, their **representations** of **each other**.
**Mutual**]{.underline} and multifaceted
**[securitization]{.underline}** answers Mitzen and Schweller\'s (2011)
call to [understand how **certainty** about the other actor\'s
**aggressive intentions** can contribute to the **onset of
war**]{.underline}.9 But this certainty, with the tragic outcome it can
result in, should not be seen as conditioned by structural uncertainty
at the outset; nor is the misplaced certainty in the next phase built
from "inside" an individual decision-maker with reference to cognitive
and affective causes (Mitzen and Schweller\'s (2011; Jervis 1976,
387--406). I submit that it is built through the multiple and spreading
self/other representations that bring the "offensive intent" of the
other into being as a social reality, making it reasonable and logical
to undertake policy steps to counter this aggressive intent.

This alternative approach also has some advantages in terms of
validation. Empirical validation of a theory is difficult if misplaced
certainty is explained by intentions. Jervis, for example, although
admitting that it is difficult to pin down whether the Cold War was a
security dilemma (2001, 38) still tries to settle this question by
revisiting archive material and establishing the nature of the US and
Soviet leaders' intentions at that time (2001, 53). My reading of the
security(zation) dilemma acknowledges that the intentions of collective
actors are inaccessible, and works from the tangible empirical fact of
words actually issued.10 When such words are understood as having
constitutive power, conditioning the paths of action collective actors
can take, it is easier to ascertain whether two parties have moved into
a situation where the use of force seems logical and legitimate.

For Norway and Russia in the North, the tragedy might be that, although
they both need a coherent ontological landscape, think of themselves as
"security-seekers" and as achieving more security through their
multifaceted securitization of the other, they might be creating a
relation devoid of any positive engagement, thereby endangering their
own physical security.

#### Vote neg to interrogate the 1AC's [epistemological failures]{.underline} and [accept insecurity]{.underline}

Mark **Neocleous 8**, Professor of Government at Brunel, 2008, "Critique
of Security," p. 185-186

[The only way out of such a dilemma]{.underline}, to escape the fetish,
[is]{.underline} perhaps [to **[eschew]{.mark} the logic of [security
altogether]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [to **[reject it]{.mark}** as so
ideologically loaded in favour of the state that any real political
thought other than the authoritarian and reactionary should be pressed
to give it up. [That]{.mark}]{.underline} is clearly something that
cannot be achieved within the limits of bourgeois thought and thus
[[could never]{.mark} even **[be]{.mark}gin** to be [imagined by the
security intellectual]{.mark}. It is]{.underline} also [something that
the constant iteration of the refrain 'this is an insecure world' and
[reiteration of one]{.mark} **fear, anxiety and
[insecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[after another will]{.mark} also
[make it hard]{.mark} to do]{.underline}. But it is something that [the
critique of security suggests we may have to consider if we want a
political **way out** of the **impasse of security**]{.underline}.¶
[This impasse exists because security has now become so all-encompassing
that it marginalises all else, most notably the constructive conflicts,
debates and discussions that animate political life]{.underline}. [The
[constant prioritising of]{.mark} a mythical [security]{.mark} as a
political end]{.underline} -- as the political end -- [[constitutes a
rejection of politics in any meaningful sense]{.mark} of the
term]{.underline}. That is, [as a mode of action in which differences
can be articulated, in which the conflicts and struggles that arise from
such differences can be fought for and negotiated, in which people might
come to **believe that another world is possible**]{.underline} -- that
they might transform the world and in turn be transformed. **[[Security
politics]{.mark} simply removes this]{.underline}**; [worse, it removes
it while purportedly addressing it]{.underline}. **[In so doing it
[suppresses all issues of power and turns]{.mark} political [questions
into debates about the most efficient way to achieve
'security']{.mark}]{.underline}**, [despite the fact that we are never
quite told]{.underline} -- never could be told -- [what might count as
having achieved it]{.underline}. [[Security politics
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, in this sense, [[an
anti-politics]{.underline}]{.mark},141 [dominating political discourse
in much the same manner as the security state tries to dominate human
beings, reinforcing security fetishism and the monopolistic character of
security on the political imagination]{.underline}. We therefore need to
get beyond security politics, not add yet more 'sectors' to it in a way
that simply expands the scope of the state and legitimises state
intervention in yet more and more areas of our lives.¶ Simon Dalby
reports a personal communication with Michael Williams, co-editor of the
important text Critical Security Studies, in which the latter asks: [[if
you take away security, what do you put in the hole that's left]{.mark}
behind?]{.underline} But I'm inclined to agree with Dalby: **[maybe
[there is no hole]{.mark}]{.underline}**.142 [[The mistake has been to
think]{.mark} that [there is]{.mark} a hole [and]{.mark} that this hole
[needs to be filled with a new vision]{.mark} or revision of security in
which it is re-mapped or civilised or gendered or humanised or expanded
or whatever]{.underline}. [All of these ultimately remain within the
**statist political imaginary**, and consequently end up reaffirming the
state as the terrain of modern politics, the grounds of security. The
real task is not to fill the supposed hole with yet another vision of
security, but to [fight for an **alternative political
language**]{.mark}]{.underline} [which takes us beyond the narrow
horizon of bourgeois security and which therefore does not constantly
throw us into the arms of the state]{.underline}. [That's the point of
critical politics: to develop a new political language more adequate to
the kind of society we want]{.underline}. Thus while much of what I have
said here has been of a negative order, part of the tradition of
critical theory is that **[[the negative may be as significant as the
positive]{.mark} in setting thought on new paths]{.underline}**.¶ For if
security really is the supreme concept of bourgeois society and the
fundamental thematic of liberalism, then [[to keep harping]{.mark} on
[about insecurity]{.mark} and to keep demanding 'more
security']{.underline} (while meekly hoping that this increased security
doesn't damage our liberty) [[is to \[foreclose\]]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[blind\] [[ourselves to the possibility of **building real
alternatives**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to the authoritarian tendencies in
contemporary politics]{.underline}. [To situate ourselves against
security politics would allow us to circumvent the debilitating effect
achieved through the constant securitising of social and political
issues, debilitating in the sense that 'security' helps consolidate the
power of the existing forms of social domination and justifies the
short-circuiting of even the most democratic forms]{.underline}. [It
would also allow us to forge another kind of politics centred on a
different conception of the good.]{.underline} **[[We need a new way of
thinking and talking]{.mark} about social being and politics [that
moves]{.mark} us [beyond security]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This would
perhaps be emancipatory in the true sense of the word. [What
[this]{.mark} might mean, precisely, [must be **open to debate**. But
it]{.mark} certainly [requires recognising]{.mark} that **[security is
an illusion]{.mark}** that has forgotten it is an illusion; it requires
recognising that security is not the same as solidarity; [it requires
**accepting**]{.mark} **that [insecurity]{.mark} is part of the human
condition**, and thus giving up the search for the certainty of security
and instead learning to tolerate the uncertainties, ambiguities and
'insecurities' that come with being human;]{.underline} it requires
accepting that 'securitizing' an issue does not mean dealing with it
politically, but bracketing it out and handing it to the state; it
requires us to be brave enough to return the gift.143

## Framework

### Framework\-\--IR

#### Prioritize [epistemological interrogation]{.underline}\-\--theory at every level is [necessary]{.underline} to establish political relevance and drive [effective political engagement]{.underline}

International Relations Theory," International Studies Quarterly, Vol
61, Issue 1, p. 64-77

In the modern context, [the intimate [linkage between politics and
knowledge is established]{.mark} and reproduced [through separation.
Only by **distancing**]{.mark} **itself** [from]{.mark} the
**particularities of [politics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and
developing]{.mark} the [language of universal reason can science
**establish**]{.mark} **its [political
relevance]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [This]{.underline}]{.mark}
[paradoxical relationship [turns on its head the]{.mark} **widely shared
[assumption]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that increasing]{.mark} levels of
**[abstraction]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[from empirical to]{.mark}
theoretical and **[metatheoretical]{.mark}
work**]{.underline}---[[undermine]{.mark} **[political
relevance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Instead, [[with every step away
from]{.mark} concrete [policies, academic studies **address broader
questions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[speak [to wider
audiences]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [and play a more **foundational role
for politics**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Eriksson 2014, 102). [Each of these
levels of abstraction]{.underline}, moreover, [constitutes an integral
part of modern science and therefore also of its political
relevance]{.underline}. "[[Practically relevant knowledge" is]{.mark}
therefore [not possible without]{.mark} "metatheoretical
**[reflection]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Reus-Smit 2013, 605), and vice
versa.¶ [[Locating]{.mark} the discipline of [IR within the context of
this]{.mark} relationship between politics and knowledge]{.underline}
also [illuminates the nature and function of some of its core features.
It [shows]{.mark} that the poverty of its subject matter, [its
fragmentation, and]{.mark} its [immaturity arise from the]{.mark}
ultimate **[limitation of]{.mark} modern
[knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[its inability to provide an account
of totality]{.underline}---[and is therefore common to all modern
sciences.]{.underline} Within this context, however, **[[fragmentation
does not function as a barrier to]{.mark} scientific
[progress]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead, [**[it drives it]{.mark}** in
the form of greater theoretical pluralism]{.underline}. And far from
indicating an "end of theory," [the waxing and waning of metatheoretical
debates results from the political implications and limitations of
scientific knowledge]{.underline}.¶ [These dynamics of modern scientific
development]{.underline}, in turn, [carry with them **political
implications**]{.underline}. Despite its universalist aspirations,
[modern knowledge is always partial and can only illuminate norms
already embodied in given practices]{.underline} rather than generating
guiding principles for practice (Weber 1948, 147). [For this reason, the
role of IR [scholars interested in improving politics cannot be reduced
to]{.mark} the "heroic" one "of [providing]{.mark} scientifically
derived [knowledge **by which**]{.mark} **foreign [policy may be
guided]{.mark}**]{.underline}," [[but must]{.mark} fundamentally
[include]{.mark} "the 'ironic' one of **[ensuring]{.mark} that [rival
explanations can be heard]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Zambernardi 2016,
4--5).¶ [[Theory]{.underline}]{.mark}, in sum, [[plays a pivotal role
for]{.mark} the [**constitution**, **reproduction**, and]{.mark}
progressive [**development** of IR]{.mark} as a modern
science]{.underline}. What is more, [theory at every level of
abstraction plays a constitutive role for the political relevance of
modern science in general. [And]{.mark} **theory, [at every level of
abstraction]{.mark}, also [plays a directly political
role]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Theory]{.mark}, in short, [is]{.mark}
both [**indispensable** and **highly practical**]{.mark}]{.underline}.¶
Finally, the implications of the present study apply also to its own
findings. [By focusing on the common epistemic basis of the modern
sciences and modern politics, I established connections between politics
and knowledge, and between IR and other disciplines. This highlights the
**political relevance** of **abstract** and **concrete**]{.underline},
good and bad quality, [and accessible and inaccessible
studies.]{.underline} Yet, by focusing on the modern episteme, this
study necessarily abstracts from the ontological dimension---from the
specificities of politics and knowledge, the differences between IR and
other modern sciences, between abstract and concrete, critical and
mainstream, good- and bad-quality work. [The source of the **confusion**
over the relevance of IR]{.underline}, however, [has always lain in the
epistemic basis of the relation between modern politics and the
sciences]{.underline}.

Securitization and desecuritization ¶ The ceteris paribus normative
push, and political recommendation of the securitization approach has
been 'less security, more politics', and the development of 'possible
modalities' for [the [desecuritization]{.mark} of politics]{.underline}
(Wæver 1989a, 52): it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} generally (which can
only be assessed in practice though) [more [conducive to treat
identities as identities]{.mark}, religion as religion, the [environment
as the environment]{.mark}, and so on, and [to
engage]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[politics through]{.mark} the
particular modalities and [rationalities of those fields **rather
than**]{.mark} **those [of security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the
received reading, whilst securitization raises issues into the realm of
security policies and practices (arrow 2a in Figure 1),
[desecuritization lowers issues back into the realm of 'regular
politics' or removes issues from the political agenda
altogether]{.underline} (arrow 1 in Figure 1). ¶ [[Desecuritization can
be achieved]{.mark} through a number of options: [by]{.mark} simply
**[not talking]{.mark} about issues [in terms of security]{.mark}**, by
[keeping responses]{.mark} to securitized issues [in forms that **do not
create security dilemmas**]{.mark}]{.underline} [or other **vicious
spirals**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} by [moving]{.mark} security
[issues back into 'normal politics']{.mark}]{.underline} (Wæver 2000,
253). These options can follow objectivist, constructivist or
deconstructivist strategies in bringing about desecuritization (Huysmans
(1995, 65--67). These strategies differ in regard to how the process
relates to the claimed threat: has the threat been dealt with, can the
security drama be somehow handled from without, or can identities beyond
security threats be produced from within the process. ¶ [Beyond
conceptualizing desecuritization as an option or a strategy, it has also
been viewed from the viewpoint of political actors]{.underline} (de
Wilde 2008, 597), [and their political moves in games of contestation
and resistance]{.underline} (Vuori 2011a, 2015). [There can be
[desecuritizing actors]{.mark} who [**evade**, circumvent or]{.mark}
**directly [oppose securitizing moves]{.mark}**]{.underline} by, for
example, emphasizing competing threats (de Wilde 2008, 597). Security
policies aim at desecuritization (the solution to the threatening
situation), but desecuritization can also happen independently from the
actions of securitizing or desecuritizing actors: the original security
problem may be solved, institutions may adapt through new reproductive
structures, discourses may change (e.g., with the loss of interest or
audiences), and the original referent object may be lost (de Wilde
2008). ¶ [A key issue of debate has been on whether desecuritization can
be considered to be an active political process, or whether
desecuritization can only happen as a fading away of the
issue]{.underline} (Behnke 2006, 65): the question is whether the logic
and possibility of securitization is necessarily retained in explicit
discussions of whether an issue has retained the status of a security
issue. [As empirical studies of securitization and desecuritization
dynamics]{.underline} (e.g., Salter and Mutlu 2013; Lupovici 2014; Vuori
2015; Donnelly 2015) have shown, [it is difficult to point to a
definitive end point for either securitization or desecuritization:
political and social situations evolve]{.underline}. Whichever the
philosophical stance on how and whether desecuritization can be achieved
(Vuori 2011a), such [empirical studies show that political actors do
make **active desecuritization moves**]{.underline}. ¶ Indeed,
systematizing empirical studies of desecuritization, Hansen (2012, 529;
539--545) has identified four ideal type forms for the concept. In
regard to its issues of concern, namely the status of enmity and the
possibility of a public sphere, when a larger conflict is still within
the realm of possibility, but [when a particular issue is presented with
terms other than security, we have an instance of (1) 'change through
**stabilisation**]{.underline}' (arrow 2b in Figure 1); when another
issue takes the place of a previously securitized issue, [we have (2)
'replacement'; when the originally phrased **threat is resolved**, we
have]{.underline} (3) **[rearticulation]{.underline}**; and
finally[,]{.underline} when potentially insecure subjects are
marginalized through depoliticization, we have (4) 'silencing' (types
2--3 are represented by arrow 1 in Figure 1). ¶ The previous literature
on both securitization (arrow 2a in Figure 1) and desecuritization
(arrow 1 in Figure 1) has produced ample illustrations of both dynamics.
As a brief example of how both dynamics can alter between the same
political actors, we can use some of the vicissitudes of Sino-Soviet
relations. ¶ China entered the Cold War in the Soviet camp and relied on
the Soviet Union as the guarantee of the international security of the
new People's Republic. Chinese views in the late 1940s clearly
structured the world into two opposing camps, with China firmly in the
Soviet one (Mao 1949). In the 1950s, however, Sino-Soviet relations
soured, and the following 'Sino-Soviet split' (Lüthi 2008) has been used
as an example of the capacity of 'parochial' securitizations to become
disaffected by or even be withdrawn from dominant 'macrosecuritizations'
(Buzan and Wæver 2009, 257). ¶ Following the split, Sino-Soviet
relations in the 1960s were characterized by intensive ideological
conflict, and Mao Zedong securitized Soviet revisionism as a major
threat for the Chinese Communist Party (Vuori 2011b). Indeed, newly
available documents suggest that it was the Chinese side, in effect Mao
Zedong, which was more active in the pursuit of ideological conflict
(Lüthi 2008, 2). In his securitization of the Soviet Union, Mao linked
the revisionism he identified there to that which he also securitized
domestically (Vuori 2011b), and the issue of revisionism was presented
as an issue of life and death for the party. ¶ Sino-Soviet relations
began to mend in the 1980s with the removal of a number of political
obstacles and with the intensification of the conflict between the
United States and the Soviet Union (Wishnick 2001). Yet, it is only with
the fall of the Soviet Union that we can see an overall desecuritization
in the form of rearticulation (Hansen 2012, 542--544) taking place in
Sino-Russian relations. In the aftermath of the end of the Cold War,
China's line was not to take the lead in international affairs. China
worked towards 'world multipolarization', which was exemplified with
China and Russia forming a 'strategic partnership' in 1996. China and
Russia even shared the same 'threat package' of 'terrorism, separatism,
and religious extremism' (the 'three evils') within the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (Jackson 2006, 310). These are strong
indicators of how the two states have managed to reform their identities
away from the Sino-Soviet antagonism. In the overall state relations
then, we can see a rearticulative desecuritization tactic at play on
both sides: ever since the early 1980s, China's policy towards the
Soviet Union (and later Russia) shifted from antagonism to one of
collaboration and negotiation rather than securitization.¶
[[Desecuritization can be conceptualized]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
above manner [[as a **negative ontological corollary** to
securitization]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet, [it is also prudent to
investigate securitization and desecuritization as political moves in
order to potentially understand the logic of when and how they are
wielded in **practical politics**]{.underline}. It is proposed here that
in addition to instances where a securitized situation is dismantled
(arrow 1 in Figure 1), [desecuritization can also be [viewed as a
political move]{.mark} that can be [deployed before 'securitization
plays' in a game]{.mark}]{.underline} of securitization (arrow 2a in
Figure 1). In other words, [desecuritization moves]{.underline} --
[[both in terms of **discourse** and **practice**]{.underline}]{.mark}
-- [can be used in a pre-emptive manner before the threshold of
securitization is reached]{.underline} (arrow 2b in Figure 1). For Wæver
(2000, 254), silencing can be a strategy to 'pre-empt or forestall
securitization'. We argue here that beyond silencing, **[[active]{.mark}
desecuritization [efforts can]{.mark} be made to [block]{.mark} the
[escalation]{.mark} of a contention]{.underline}**. Thereby, in addition
to change through stabilization (Hansen 2012) and the silencing of an
issue (Wæver 2000), [**[there can be explicit rebuttals of security
frames]{.mark} and claims [before they are solidified into
policy]{.mark}**. This tactic can be termed 'pre-emptive
desecuritization through rebuttal'.]{.underline}

### Framework\-\--Narratives

#### Narratives [matter]{.underline}. They are [reflective]{.underline} of broader political and cultural contexts, and [legitimate]{.underline} systems of power.

Knowing the threat: narratives and security knowledge

[**Narrative analysis** has]{.underline} been widely [employed in **IR**
and **security studies** to explore how]{.underline} certain [issues are
understood and communicated or what]{.underline} political [consequences
of telling a]{.underline} particular [**narrative** there may
be]{.underline} (Bliesemann de Guevara, 2016; Krebs, 2015; Miskimmon et
al., 2014, 2017; Neumann, 2002; Spencer, 2016). Employing diverse
theoretical approaches, all these **[studies]{.underline}** nevertheless
**[concur]{.underline}** that [a well-crafted **narrative** represents a
**potent way** of rendering]{.underline} unfamiliar [phenomena
**understandable** and **presentable**]{.underline} to a wider audience
(White, 1990). [Building on]{.underline} these insights as well as those
of **[securitisation theory]{.underline}** (Buzan et al., 1998; Ördén,
2019), [we propose a **generalisable**]{.underline} heuristic
**[framework]{.underline}** [for the study of **security narratives** in
IR]{.underline}, together with their underlying knowledge, based around
the four elements of threat, protected value, response and knowledge.

[Narratives are **stories** told by people]{.underline} in order [to
make sense of their **practices** and the **problems** they
**face**]{.underline} (Bueger, 2013; Selbin, 2010; Wagenaar, 2011).
[Although a]{.underline} given [situation might not]{.underline}
necessarily [have]{.underline} a [meaning and **cohesiveness** in
itself, a **narrative** helps]{.underline} to [craft a **coherent
interpretation** -- a story -- that reduces]{.underline} any
[**complexity** and **uncertainty** that the situation might be posing
and **reconstructs** the **identity** of the **narrator**]{.underline}
(Homolar, 2011; Subotić, 2016; Wagenaar, 2011: 215). Thus, [narratives
assemble]{.underline} heterogenous elements (protagonists, practices,
wider structures and conditions influencing behaviour) into [a **larger
story**]{.underline}, articulated along particularly defined causes and
effects (Bueger and Gadinger, 2018: 74; Edkins, 2019; Homolar and
Rodríguez-Merino, 2019). [This]{.underline} also [means]{.underline}
that [narratives can speak]{.underline} ostensibly [about the **same
issue**]{.underline}, yet establish very different links between the
presented causes, effects and prospective actions, leading to stories
[with]{.underline} markedly **[different meanings]{.underline}**
(Stampnitzky, 2014: 6--7).

[Narratives are articulated from]{.underline} the broader
[knowledge]{.underline} that is [available to their **producers**,
reflecting what is **accepted** and **valued** in]{.underline} their
respective [**cultural** and **political** **contexts**]{.underline}
(Bueger, 2013; Jasanoff, 2007; Wagenaar, 2011).2 [The]{.underline}
particular types of **[knowledge]{.underline}** that are [drawn upon
serve as **prisms** through which a **policy issue** is
**constructed**]{.underline} in a certain way [and]{.underline} they
also [**stabilise** the **narrative links**]{.underline} between what
are presented as the main problems and their causes (Stampnitzky, 2014:
6--7). [For example, the story of]{.underline} the [conflict in
**Afghanistan** and policies proposed to **'solve' it** are very
different depending on whether they are weaved]{.underline} together
[from]{.underline} academic knowledge of [**Afghan tribal politics**,
or]{.underline} articulated from **[military counterinsurgency
doctrines]{.underline}** (Berling, 2019). While knowledge provides the
basis for the construction of a narrative, its manifestation as
[expertise]{.underline} -- socially recognised and authoritative
proficiency in certain issues -- [plays an important role]{.underline}
also [for the **legitimation** of the narrative's reading of a
problem]{.underline} (Berling and Bueger, 2015: 7; Boswell, 2008).
Therefore, we pay attention to what sorts of knowledge provide a basis
for narrative constructions of HW and what types of expertise are
articulated to give them credibility.

Building on previously outlined narrative characteristics, we propose a
generalisable framework to reconstruct the different narratives in the
Czech debate on HW on the basis of the main threat (its form and
location), the main threatened value and the main action needed to
counter the threat and protect the threatened value. In other words, as
Stavrianakis (2020: 233) succinctly put it in her analysis of risk
discourses, we explore how [particular narratives explain
'where]{.underline} potential [harm **comes from**, to **whom** or
**what**, and **how**?' and 'who has the **ability** to generate a
**constituency** **to act'**]{.underline}. Together, [these constitute
a]{.underline} more or less [**coherent plot** linking the **security
problem** with its **causes**, potential negative consequences for those
that need to be **protected** and a **desirable reaction** to avoid
**these consequences**]{.underline} (Bueger and Gadinger, 2018: 74). In
the final step, we also add a fourth element: the type of knowledge and
expertise these narratives put forward.

### Framework\-\--Geopolitical Imaginations

#### Evaluate competing [geopolitical imaginations]{.underline}.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629821001621

[Our research is]{.underline} located [in **critical geopolitics**, from
which we borrow]{.underline} the [understanding]{.underline} of
[geopolitics as **discourses** and]{.underline} [**practices** through
which people ''**spatialize**' international politics and represent it
as a '**world**']{.underline} characterized by particular types of
places, peoples and dramas' (Ó Tuathail & Agnew, 1992, p. 192).
[**Critical geopolitics** focuses on how **political events** are
**articulated** as somehow related to]{.underline} or driven by
[**geographic phenomena**, or how issues are
'**geopoliticised**',]{.underline} that is [constructed as
**geopolitical problems**]{.underline} (Cadier, 2019, p. 71). [These
ideas are]{.underline} best [captured by]{.underline} the concept of
[**geopolitical imagination**: 'Geopolitical imaginations are the result
of **subjects'** attempt to **make sense** of the **world** by
associating **political values** with]{.underline} various [parts of
that **map**. They can also]{.underline} be spoken of [in the
**collective sense**, in which a group can]{.underline} be said to [have
**similar**]{.underline} (if ultimately unique) [**visions** of the
**world**.]{.underline}' (Dittmer & Dodds, 2008, p. 447) More recently,
[critical geopolitics]{.underline} has [paid]{.underline} increased
[attention to **affects** and **emotions**]{.underline} (Gökarıksel &
Secor, 2020; Laketa, 2019; Müller, 2013; Pain, 2009).1 Such [affective
geopolitics explores how **affects** are an **indivisible part** of
**social construction** of **space**, as they are]{.underline}
intimately [entangled with **languages** and **images** through which
our '**mental maps**' are **produced** and
**disseminated**]{.underline}. Summarising this broader argument, Laketa
argues that [geopolitics should be understood 'both as **socially
produced** and **intimately experienced**']{.underline} and,
consequently, 'the emotional and the affective become the site of the
geopolitical' and vice versa (Laketa, 2019, pp. 156, 160). Therefore,
[international politics is **spatialised**]{.underline} also [by
engaging subjects at the **affective level**, which is an **essential
part** of the production of **geopolitical imaginations** through which
**subjects view** the **world** and their **place within it**. This
links **critical geopolitics** to]{.underline} a range of [literatures
that deal with]{.underline} the relationship between [**identity**,
**emotions** and **affects**, including]{.underline} the scholarship on
[**ontological security** and **anxiety**]{.underline} in IR.

The rapidly growing [literature on **o**ntological **s**ecurity is
concerned with how **subjects**]{.underline} -- individuals, groups, or
states -- [deal with]{.underline} the **[uncertainty]{.underline}** of
modern life [without losing]{.underline} the '[security of the **self**,
the]{.underline} subjective [sense of **who one is**']{.underline}
(Mitzen, 2006, p. 344) that defines ontological security and makes life
bearable. [Building]{.underline} mainly [upon]{.underline} the work of
Anthony **[Giddens]{.underline}** (1991)[,]{.underline} classical
[contributions agree]{.underline} that [ontological security is
**sought** through]{.underline} an active process of [constructing the
**self** and **anchoring it**]{.underline} in the social world, which
happens [through]{.underline} the establishment of
[routines]{.underline} (Mitzen, 2006), creation of [biographical
narratives]{.underline} (Kinnvall, 2004; Steele, 2008; Subotić, 2016),
[or]{.underline} maintenance of [relationships]{.underline}
(Berenskoetter & Giegerich, 2010). [The key]{.underline} underlying
[purpose]{.underline} of ontological security-seeking [is to avoid
**anxiety**]{.underline}, which Giddens, following Freud, understands as
an elusive and paralysing 'generalised state of \[...\] emotions' that
is different from fear (Giddens, 1991, p. 44). [Fear is]{.underline} 'a
basic emotion [directed at a **specific object**]{.underline} that
prompts an adaptive response: fight or flight.' (Kinnvall & Mitzen,
2020, p. 241). In contrast, '[anxiety is **diffuse**, it is
**free-floating**: lacking a **specific object'**, which makes it
possible to **'pin' it** to **different things** and
**concepts**]{.underline} (Giddens, 1991, p. 44).
[Repressing]{.underline} the elusive [**anxiety** by]{.underline} this
'[pinning']{.underline}, which transforms it into the manageable fear of
something, [is]{.underline} then [one]{.underline} of the **[key
motive]{.underline}**s [of **human behaviour**]{.underline}. [As
**anxiety** is]{.underline} considered [overwhelming]{.underline} and
paralysing[; the '**chaos'** that 'threatens]{.underline} on the other
side of the ordinariness of the [everyday conventions']{.underline}
(1991, p. 37)[, subjects]{.underline} often prefer to [deal with it
through]{.underline} the [production of **fear** via]{.underline} the
discursive [**construction** of '**specific objects** and
**threats'**]{.underline} (Chernobrov, 2019, p. 39). [This involves
reaching to]{.underline} well-worn [**identity discourses**,
which]{.underline} serve as vehicles for ['\[t\]ransform]{.underline}ing
the [**anxiety** of the **unknown** into the **security** of the
**known**]{.underline} (recognizable, even if illusory) \[that\] affirms
the identity of the perceiving subject and enables it to confidently
interact with the international other.' (ibid.)

These arguments have a direct purchase for critical geopolitics, as
[**geopolitical imaginations** are good **examples** of how such
**sense-making** and **anxiety-managing discourses**]{.underline} can
[look like]{.underline}. Some have already recognised and developed this
link. For Guzzini, [the 'revival of **geopolitical thought**' in Europe
is]{.underline} directly [linked to **ontological
insecurity**]{.underline} stemming [from]{.underline} 'the sense of
[**disorientation** and]{.underline} foreign policy **[identity
crises]{.underline}** which followed 1989.' (Guzzini, 2016, pp. 14--15)
Making a more explicit link between anxiety and fear, Browning develops
a very similar argument: ['The attraction of **tropes** of a **new Cold
War**]{.underline} and a return of geopolitics [is]{.underline}
precisely [that they solve **anxiety**]{.underline} about current events
[by fitting them into]{.underline} clearly [**established systems** of
**meaning**,]{.underline} though doing so entails reducing anxiety by
[**emphasising** a **world** of **threats** and **fears**']{.underline}
(Browning, 2018, p. 113).

### Framework\-\--Hybrid War

Conclusion

[This **article** analyses how]{.underline} the threat of [**HW** is
**constructed**]{.underline} in the Czech public debate. Connecting
narrative analysis with attention to the role of knowledge and expertise
in making authoritative claims on security issues, [we
argue]{.underline} that the [broader **HW discourse** can be
**disentangled** into **three narratives** that link the **exact
nature** of the **main threat**, **protected value** and **response** in
different ways]{.underline}. Furthermore, we show how [different bodies
of knowledge provide a basis for **differing ways** of **narrating** and
**justifying** a **specific understanding** of **HW**.]{.underline}
While [the literature]{.underline} has [already criticised the
**vagueness** and **broadness** of the **HW label**]{.underline}, we
highlight how this vagueness accommodates different readings of the main
threat. We show that HW is a very different issue when interpreted
through the lens of military science, popular literature on Russian
history or cognitive psychology.

The [**disentangling** of]{.underline} the [**HW discourse** matters
for]{.underline} both future analyses of HW and [**'real-life' effects**
of the discourse. As nearly **anything** that has a **vague reference**
to dangers in the **information domain**, challenges posed by
**illiberalism** or **great-power politics** can be attached to the **HW
label**; it is difficult to know what **HW points** to exactly, and
where the **threat** is **located**]{.underline} precisely. This is
unhelpful both for a sound risk analysis and for an informed and
critical public debate. It also has profound political implications. [An
unproblematised reception of]{.underline} the **[HW]{.underline}**
discourse [contributes to]{.underline} the **[creeping
securitisation]{.underline}** [of issues that would have
not]{.underline} necessarily [been linked to **security**]{.underline}
otherwise, [such as **media literacy** or **public
diplomacy**]{.underline} (Szostek, 2020). [Proliferation of **security
framings**]{.underline} of different issues in the name of HW
[can]{.underline}, furthermore, [lead to **mutually undermining** and
**contradicting policy reactions**]{.underline}. It makes a difference
whether we treat the public as critically thinking citizens that can
(with some assistance) make up their own minds, or if we understand them
as a passive mass that needs to be protected from even being reached by
hostile messaging or disinformation (see also Ördén, 2019). Each implies
a markedly different view of the citizen -- as active subject shaping
their own life versus passive object in need of protection -- and her
relation to the government. Similarly, [it matters whether we
understand]{.underline} our [adversaries as **rational actors** that can
be **deterred** or **accommodated**,]{.underline} as the defence
narrative does, [or as **malign** and inherently **irrational
'others'**]{.underline} [with whom we share no **common rules or
logics**, as in the **counterinfluence narrative**]{.underline} (see
Rühle, 2019).

[A spectre]{.underline} is [haunt]{.underline}ing [the
West]{.underline}ern world -- [the spectre of **hybrid warfare**. All
threats "**hybrid**" have become the buzzword]{.underline} of the
international security commentariat [ever since Russia's]{.underline}
swift [annexation of **Crimea**]{.underline} in 2014 [with]{.underline}
the help of the "[little]{.underline} polite [green men]{.underline}" 1
and Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. The
allegedly Kremlin-led meddling in the US presidential elections of 2016
is the most recent highprofile episode in this sequence of low-intensity
"political warfare", described by Mark Galeotti (2016b) as a "21st
century conflict, more Machiavellian than military, where hacks, leaks
and fake news are taking the place of planes, bombs and missiles".
Similar destabilisation campaigns have been noticed in the context of
the French presidential election and in the build-up to German federal
elections in 2017, and in numerous other European states.2

While the "new wars" debate has a long pedigree in international studies
(Kaldor 1999, 2013, Henderson and Singer 2002, Evans 2003, Newman 2004,
Smith 2005, Hoffman 2007, Münkler 2005, Strachan and Scheipers 2011),
the [scholarship]{.underline} has [remained]{.underline} largely [silent
on]{.underline} the [potential of]{.underline} these [wars to generate
**immaterial insecurity effects**. This article offers an **ontological
security**]{.underline}-situated [**reading** on the]{.underline} added
[insights]{.underline} the notion "**[hybrid warfare]{.underline}**"
[brings to bear for our understanding of the]{.underline} contemporary
[Western]{.underline} security [predicament. **Ontological
security**]{.underline} (OS) is a condition [underpin]{.underline}ning
[the actor's ability to **act** in the **world** with]{.underline} basic
[confidence about how the **world works**]{.underline} and her own place
within it.3 **[Ontological insecurity]{.underline}**, in turn,
[signifies "the **deep**, incapacitating **state** of not knowing how to
**get by** in the **world**]{.underline}" (Mitzen and Schweller 2011, p.
29). [With an]{.underline} explicit [emphasis on **uncertainty** and
**anxiety** as the key referents in ontological (in)security, this
contribution seeks to]{.underline} complement the literature on the
changing character of war by [illuminat]{.underline}ing
[the]{.underline} disturbing [ripple effect of **hybrid
warfare**]{.underline} not only for the central security-political
organisations of the West, but also [for]{.underline} the [**ontological
underpinnings** of]{.underline} the International Relations
(**[IR]{.underline}**) discipline more generally.

[I]{.underline} propose to [link]{.underline} the study of
[OS]{.underline} in IR systematically [with]{.underline} the debates on
[hybrid warfare along **ontological**, **epistemological**, and
**ethical dimensions** to provide]{.underline} sharpened [analytical
purchase for understanding]{.underline} the nature of, and the emerging
[Western responses]{.underline} to, the said challenge. An OS
perspective brings to the generally policy-centric study of hybrid
threat management a systematic and conceptually rigorous understanding
of the dual dynamic of anxiety (as a sense of unease and uncertainty),
and routinised practices (as modes to confront anxiety in order to
provide a stable cognitive environment) with important ethical and legal
implications for conceptualising war (see Mitzen 2006, p. 346). My main
argument is that "**[hybrid warfare]{.underline}**" [capsizes an
embedded **cognitive structure** about what **war is**]{.underline},
thus [defying]{.underline} [attempts of **organising life** and **social
relations** in a **particular way**, with]{.underline} fundamental
[consequences for the **OS** of]{.underline} the European Union (EU) and
**[NATO]{.underline}**. I proceed from the premise that defending and
[promoting a]{.underline} particular [vision of one's self is important
for the "**security** of **being**" of]{.underline} these
[Western]{.underline} security-political [institutions, and a
**prerequisite** for]{.underline} the [strategic use of their
agency]{.underline} (Flockhart 2016, p. 801). [This article offers an
**exploration** of]{.underline} the EU and [NATO's **identity
maintenance**]{.underline} "especially [by **acting**]{.underline}, or
doing things" (Mitzen and Schweller 2011, p. 28) [vis-à-vis **hybrid
threats.**]{.underline} It thus subscribes to Flockhart's suggestion
that the two strategies of OS maximisation (a "strategy of being" and a
"strategy of doing") are interlinked and cannot be understood in
isolation from one another (Flockhart 2016, p. 799, p. 816).

[What]{.underline} authority [claims are]{.underline} the EU and [NATO
making about their **ability** and **competence** to handle **hybrid
challenges**]{.underline}, or the "new type of warfare"? [What is the
"**security story**" these **bodies articulate**]{.underline},
accordingly[? How are their respective attempts of countering "**hybrid
threats**" embedded in **particular understandings** of **politics** and
war?]{.underline} What signs of discursive cross-pollination can we
observe comparing the two organisations in their hybrid threat/warfare
management strategies and practices? [How does it all relate
to]{.underline} their respective **[identity sustenance]{.underline}**
struggles**[?]{.underline}**

#### Utilitarian appeals to rehabilitate security occlude resisting its foundations

Chris **Rossdale 16**, Teaching Fellow, International Relations,
University of Warwick, "Activism, resistance and security," Chapter 14
of *Ethical Security Studies: A new research agenda*, eds. Nyman and
Burke, 2016, no page \#

The previous two sections have highlighted a number of ways in which
practices of resistance and activism engage the relationship between
ethics and security in different ways. [In]{.underline} producing
subjugated knowledges, revealing the exclusions and power relations of
established discourses, and [engaging in [security practices]{.mark}
which seek to more directly respond to the insecurity faced by ordinary
people, they [invite an **ethical response to security**]{.mark} and
insecurity]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, [it limits our
engagement]{.underline} with practices of resistance [if we only see
them as exploring 'better' or 'more ethical' ways of providing
security]{.underline}. [[The **more**]{.mark} **[radical
challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the politics of security
[[comes]{.underline}]{.mark} when we see activism [[not simply as
refusing **particular orders** of security, but]{.mark} as [resisting
the **very**]{.mark} **conceptual and political [foundations of
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This final section explores such an
interpretation, looking at the ways in which the most substantive way to
engage the relationships between ethics, security, resistance and
activism comes when we view practices of resistance as (at their best)
working to deconstruct security. I begin by outlining some of the
arguments which suggest that the concept of **[[security cannot]{.mark}
so easily [be refashioned]{.mark} in a more ethical form]{.underline}**
and that thinking in terms of resistance might take us further. I then
look at how we might view such a resistance in the context of political
activism, looking at some examples from anarchist activist groups.¶ A
number of writers have argued that the concept of [security is built
around a series of]{.underline} images, [codes and logics which render
it deeply problematic and a dangerous candidate for
rehabilitation]{.underline}. They have pointed out the ways in which
[our contemporary fascination with]{.underline} proliferating images of
[threat, danger and response]{.underline}, grounded in desperate but
impossible fantasies of control and mastery, [tends towards]{.underline}
authoritarian political formations and [the de facto legitimacy of
dominant power relations]{.underline} (Edkins 2003; Campbell 1998:
Shepherd 2008: 72--75). The pursuit of [[security serves to]{.mark}
**[contain subjects within the existing order]{.mark}**]{.underline},
promising protection in return for some level of compliance or obedience
in a manner not dissimilar to a protection racket (Spike Peterson 1992:
50--52). As Mark Neocleous notes, [[such dynamics]{.mark} serve to
**[neutralise radical]{.mark} political [action]{.mark}**]{.underline},
'encouraging us to surrender ourselves to the state in a thoroughly
conservative fashion' (2008: 4).¶ To understand how the pursuit of
security intertwines with political authority, it is important to
recognise the dependent relationship between security and insecurity.
[Institutions and technologies of [security can only function in a
context of insecurities]{.mark}]{.underline}, which they may identify
and seek to pacify, but which they also need (and for which, of course,
they are often responsible). In Michael Dillon's terms, 'it is only
because it is contoured by insecurity, and because in its turn it also
insecures, that security can secure' (1996: 127). The nature and content
of security depends on its particular relationship with insecurity, with
its exclusions and violences and particular (political) designations of
threat. This regulative binary of security/insecurity intersects with
others that have similar effects, such as order/chaos, inside/outside
and sovereignty/anarchy. All of them regulate politics in a manner which
cements the place of political authority. On the latter dichotomy,
Richard Ashley's comments are pertinent:¶ On the one hand, the sign of
'sovereignty' betokens a rational identity: a homogeneous and continuous
presence that is hierarchically ordered, that has a unique centre of
decision presiding over a coherent 'self', and that is demarcated from,
and in opposition to, an external domain of difference and change that
resists assimilation to its identical being. On the other hand, the sign
of 'anarchy' betokens this residual external domain: an aleatory domain
characterised by difference and discontinuity, contingency and
ambiguity, that can be known only for its lack of the coherent truth and
meaning expressed by a sovereign presence. 'Anarchy' signifies a
problematic domain yet to be brought under the controlling influence of
a sovereign centre ... whether it be an individual actor, a group, a
class, or a political community.¶ (1988: 230)¶ As he identifies the
conservatising regulation at the heart of the sovereignty/anarchy
dichotomy, so would I suggest that a similar process is at work in the
logic of security, privileging that which is rationally bounded,
coherent and compliant, and necessitating the pacification or
pathologisation of that which is not.¶ [Political imaginaries rooted in
binary concepts limit our ethical landscape in a variety of
ways]{.underline}. As V. Spike Peterson argues:¶ \[a\]s long as we
remain locked in dichotomies, [we cannot accurately understand and are
less likely to transform social relations]{.underline}: not only do
oppositional constructions distort the contextual complexity of social
reality, [they set limits on the questions we ask and the alternatives
we consider]{.underline}. True to their "origin" (Athenian objectivist
metaphysics), the dichotomies most naturalized in Western world views
(abstract-concrete, reason-emotion, mind-body, culture-nature,
public-private) are both medium and outcome of objectification
practices. Retaining them keeps us locked in to their
objectifying-reifying-lens on our world(s) and who we are.¶ (1992: 54)¶
In such a context, **[[rather than]{.mark} seeking to [rehabilitate
security]{.mark}]{.underline}** [([and remain within
this]{.underline}]{.mark} [security/insecurity
[dichotomy]{.mark}]{.underline}[), [it might be more productive
to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[resist, displace or [deconstruct
it]{.mark}]{.underline}**.¶ This is not a simple prospect; [refusing the
social fantasy of security would]{.underline}, in Jenny Edkins' terms,
involve 'facing, on a day-to-day basis, questions many of us prefer to
forget, if we can', and 'would involve a shift away from the notion of
sovereign state and sovereign individual ... would [entail the
development of a new vision of political community]{.underline}, one
that was not based on the coming together of discrete participles to
produce closed systems' (2003: 368--369). While [the violent politics of
security is]{.underline} enacted through social institutions, it is also
(as the discussion above shows) [embedded in categories of
thought]{.underline}. The binaries of security/insecurity, order/chaos,
sovereignty/anarchy and more impose a theoretical domination which
conditions political possibility in particular authoritarian ways. As
such, the task of resistance might be to break down such binaries. [This
may take place through]{.underline} mocking, subverting or outwardly
refusing the closures such binaries enact (Rossdale forthcoming-a;
Rossdale forthcoming-b), or through [embracing the proliferation of
definitions of security as a]{.underline}n aporetic [space in which 'to
think and create **new social, ethical and economic relationships**
outside the]{.underline} oppressive structures of [political and
epistemological order']{.underline} (Burke 2007: 30--31).¶ What I want
to suggest here is that we can interpret many practices of activism and
resistance as engaging in precisely this kind of resistance to
security/insecurity; that is, not just as affirming 'more ethical'
securities (though they may also do this), but as mounting a challenge
to the conceptual and political order of security more generally. In a
sense, this is not surprising, so often is resistance framed as that
insecurity, chaos and anarchy which necessitates securing, ordering and
sovereign gestures. It is also an unstable series of interventions,
liable to recuperation within a set of security discourses which swiftly
reposition challenge as threat. Nonetheless, these
[[resistances]{.underline}]{.mark} hold [[open spaces for an]{.mark}
[ethical critique not only of **particular orders of security**]{.mark},
[but]{.mark} more generally [of **the ways**]{.mark} **in which
[security orders]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Link\-\--China

#### The aff's description of conflict with China is a [self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline}\-\--it reinforces violent power relations and causes militarized policies aimed at countering China

Affairs, "East Asia's Power Shift: The Flaws and Hazards of the Debate
and How to Avoid Them", Asian Perspective 38 (2014), 337--362, ProQuest

Once we acknowledge that [academic concepts and analyses can have
**constitutive effects**]{.underline}, we need to analyze their
performative role. This means addressing the "double hermeneutic"---the
way "'findings' of the social sciences very often enter constitutively
into the world they describe" (Giddens 1987, 20)---and reflecting on
what our interpretations might "do" (Guzzini 2007, 23). It is not
necessary to accept social constructivism to recognize that [the
practice of [social science is **interlinked with power
relations**]{.mark} outside of academia]{.underline}. Far from scholarly
navel-gazing, [[a reflexive attitude is]{.mark} arguably a
[necessary]{.mark} ingredient of any rigorous social science
practice]{.underline} (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992).¶ Hence, since [[the
power-shift discourse]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[is not simply a
descriptive account]{.mark} of an independent reality
[but]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[is]{.mark} destined to be **[constitutive
of]{.mark} that [reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it is essential to
explore its power. Thomas Diez (2005) makes a similar investigation into
the power of the concept of "normative power Europe" (NPE). He finds
that NPE constructs a benevolent and peaceful identity for Europe, but
also that its alleged peacefulness is contrasted with and therefore
dependent on an idea of what Europe is not---an outside consisting of
"challenging threats" (2005, 636). The double hermeneutic twist is that
the coining of the originally academic NPE concept has become an
important instance of Europe's "normative power."¶ Diez (2013), however,
seems to take for granted the distinction between post-Westphalian
normative powers, which engage in a struggle over the definition of
"normality" in world politics, and Westphalian great powers, which
engage in war, empire building, and physical conquest. "Great powers,"
however, are also the products of normative, discursive pressures, and
they reproduce ideas of what is "normal" great-power behavior. Much of
[[the power-shift discourse reproduces the]{.mark} same familiar
**[self/ other dichotomy]{.mark}**]{.underline} as the NPE literature.
Here, [[the other is a rising and]{.mark} potentially [threatening
China,]{.mark} while the self is a weak but inherently righteous
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[/West/Japan]{.underline}.¶ Pan
argues that the "[[China threat discourse" is]{.mark} "always
intrinsically [linked to how US policymakers]{.mark}/mainstream China
specialists [see themselves]{.mark}]{.underline} [([as]{.mark}
representatives of [the indispensable]{.mark}, security-conscious
[nation]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example)" (2004, 306). Hagström
demonstrates how [the [discourse]{.mark} on Japan's "abnormality" and
"weakness" [reproduces a **standard**]{.mark} **of
"[normality]{.mark}**" in world politics that is [centered on the
**ability to go to war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Postwar Japan is socially
constructed as deviant from this norm and thus as a threat to itself.
This discourse, which emerges in both Japanese and Western academia and
in Japanese political debate, legitimizes a road map for a more
"realistic," "active," "responsible," and "normal" Japan (Hagström
2014).¶ [The power of the power-shift discourse does not stop at the
production of identities and standards]{.underline}. The point is that
[identities and standards produce effects]{.underline}. Pan illustrates
this by showing how the Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1995--1996 was often
understood as "further objective proof of the long-suspected 'China
threat,'" but few acknowledged that "the 'China threat' discourse itself
had played a constitutive role in the lead-up to that crisis" (2004,
323, 320). Moreover, standards in Japan's "normalization" discourse have
enabled Realpolitik changes in its foreign security policy. Chinese
vigilance vis-à-vis Japan and the United States might also be
interpreted as discursive phenomena---the theme of national
reinvigoration is a product of the lingering notion that China has been
continually humiliated and victimized by the great powers since the
nineteenth century. As these examples illustrate, [[the ultimate
power]{.mark} of discourse [is the production of **self-fulfilling
prophecies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. When self-fulfilling prophecies occur
on both sides of a dyad, [[we might end up with a **socially generated
security dilemma**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Johnston 2004).¶ Much research
has warned of self-fulfilling prophecies in the East Asian context. Some
observers suggest that US or Japanese discourses about China might
produce policies of containment, Japanese "normalization" and
"remilitarization," and US "rebalancing" toward East Asia (Pan 2004;
2012; Hagström 2012; Turner 2014a; 2014b). Nonetheless, Japan and the
United States have not yet embarked on containing China. Instead, both
countries have on the whole accommodated China's rise (Christensen 2006;
Jerdén and Hagström 2012). In a similar manner, perceived increases in
bellicose or nationalistic representations in Chinese discourses led
some observers to jump to the mistaken conclusion that this had already
resulted in a more assertive Chinese foreign policy (Jerdén 2014). As
important as it is to remain vigilant against the emergence of socially
constructed security dilemmas, we need to bear in mind that there is no
deterministic connection between discourse and policy---just an enabling
one. Dominant discourses create propensities for action but do not make
any action inevitable. More empirically informed theorizing is needed to
address the questions of how, when, and why discourses make some actions
politically conceivable, easy to communicate, and sometimes even
coercive (Holland 2013).¶ Reflecting on the possible power exercised
through the alternative approaches introduced in this special issue is
also necessary. In this article [we raise analytical and normative
concerns about the ideas of a more "powerful" and "threatening" China, a
"weak" Japan, and a "declining" United States]{.underline}. We argue
that [such [representations risk **offsetting balancing policies** and a
**security dilemma in East Asia**, in line with]{.mark} [the
self-fulfilling prophecy]{.mark} logic discussed above]{.underline}.
These arguments clearly belong to another site of discursive power
production. That we have not seen any obvious balancing policies in East
Asia thus far might arguably be interpreted as one of its effects.

1\. Introduction

[This article theorises the relation]{.underline}ship [between
**geopolitics** and **anxiety** and]{.underline} uses this conceptual
argument to analyse and [**critique** the discourse of '**hybrid
warfare**']{.underline}. Conceptual works on the link between
geopolitics and anxiety are scarce, despite contemporaneous appearance
of the claims that we are experiencing (yet another) 'return of
geopolitics' (Auer, 2015; Guzzini, 2012, 2016) and that 'we live in
anxious times' (Eklundh, Zevnik, & Guittet, 2017, p. 1; Kinnvall &
Mitzen, 2020; Zevnik, 2017b) in academic and public debates.
[We]{.underline} fill this gap by [introduc]{.underline}ing the notion
of [**anxiety geopolitics** as a type of **affective discourse**
that]{.underline} emerges to [relieve]{.underline} the [subjects
from]{.underline} the uprooting experience of [anxiety by
anchoring]{.underline} both [the **self** and the]{.underline} alleged
[source of **danger** within a **familiar 'mental map'**]{.underline}.
However, [as anxiety can never be **fully**]{.underline} resolved or
[**repressed**, **discursive fixes**, including **geopolitical** ones,
are **always temporary** and **eventually failing**]{.underline}. We
contend that [anxiety geopolitics is an]{.underline} ultimately
[ambivalent, **Janus-faced** way of 'writing global space']{.underline}
(Ó Tuathail, 1996), [in which anxiety is]{.underline} both
[**repressed** and **reproduced** through **geopolitical
discourses**]{.underline}.

In making these arguments, we build upon and contribute to multiple
literatures in political geography and international relations. First,
conceptualising geopolitics as a discourse through which global politics
becomes spatialised, we borrow from the canon of critical geopolitics.
We follow especially the more recent turn towards affective geopolitics,
understanding affects as intertwined in the process of discursive
construction. So far, anxiety has received only rare attention in this
body of work (an exception is Gökarıksel & Secor, 2020), a gap this
article addresses by theorising the role of anxiety in geopolitics in
detail. Second, in adopting [the]{.underline} argument that
[**construction** of **identity narratives** is a way to **manage
anxiety** and make sense of the world]{.underline}, we engage with the
IR literature on ontological security. Yet, conversely,
[this]{.underline} body of work has [dealt with geopolitics only
**scarcely**]{.underline} (Browning, 2018; Guzzini, 2012, 2016), and
these rare studies rely on a reductionist notion of anxiety. For these
purposes, [we reach to]{.underline} a third literature, namely the work
on [the political dimension of **anxiety** embedded]{.underline}
(mostly) [in **Lacan**ian social theory]{.underline}.

[We]{.underline} then [utilise these]{.underline} theoretical [arguments
to]{.underline} analyse and [**critique 'hybrid warfare'**
(HW)]{.underline}, one of the key security discourses of our time. To
start with, [it is not easy to find out what **HW** is supposed to
**mean**]{.underline} exactly[, as there are]{.underline} many [varying
definitions of]{.underline} the interchangeably used [notions of
'**hybrid wars**', '**hybrid threats**' or '**hybrid
campaigns**']{.underline} (for a magisterial conceptual discussion see
Fridman, 2018). [Most]{.underline} of them typically [label
some]{.underline} form of [combination of 'military and non-military as
well as covert and overt means' of **conflict**]{.underline} (NATO,
2019). This is usually followed by long lists of disparate examples.
According to one EU definition, [**hybrid threats** 'range from
**cyberattacks** on]{.underline} critical information systems, through
the disruption of critical services such as **[energy]{.underline}**
supplies [or **financial services**, to]{.underline} the
[undermining]{.underline} of public [trust in
**government**]{.underline} institutions [or]{.underline} the
[deepening]{.underline} of [**social divisions**']{.underline} (
European Union, 2018). In this logic, HW targets a wide range of
pre-existing social issues, political cleavages and security
vulnerabilities, while seeking to amplify and exploit them for the
benefit of the attacker. The covert and psychological character of such
form of attack then appears to be particularly worrying, as '[hybrid
campaigns]{.underline}' [are]{.underline} 'designed to be [difficult to
**detect** or **attribute**]{.underline}' so as [to '**create
confusion**']{.underline} (European Union, 2018) [and]{.underline}
'[**sow doubt** in]{.underline} the minds of **[target
populations']{.underline}** (NATO, 2019). Clearly, [such definitions of
HW are **so broad** that they]{.underline} can [encompass **almost
anything**]{.underline}; 'any possible combination of military and
non-military means' or even 'any possible hostile activity' as has been
argued elsewhere (Fridman, 2018, p. 155). Consequently and in line with
approaches rooted in critical geopolitics, we do not provide an
authoritative definition of our own. Instead, [we focus on how **HW** is
used in **discourse** to produce certain **(geo)political
effects**]{.underline}.

Apart from being a highly relevant problem, **[HW]{.underline}** also
[presents]{.underline} a particularly fitting case to be analysed as [an
instance of **anxiety geopolitics**]{.underline}. First,
[the]{.underline} close [link]{.underline} between [**HW** and
**anxiety** has been]{.underline} explicitly [recognised by Maria
**Mälksoo**, who shows how HW triggers '**anxiety** about]{.underline}
the [difficulties of **concretising unknown** and **indeterminate
threats**']{.underline} (Mälksoo, 2018, p. 378). Second, the relation
between HW and geopolitics is at the same time strongly pronounced and
marked by a profound tension. On the one hand, [HW]{.underline}
ostensibly [departs from a '**modern'**]{.underline} geopolitical
[imagination based on **territorial states** and
**borders**]{.underline} (Ó Tuathail, 1998). After all, [it is about
information operations]{.underline} in deterritorialised spaces of the
globalised public sphere[, unattributable cyberattacks]{.underline}
carried out by non-state groups, [or]{.underline} the incitement of
[horizontal **protest** movements]{.underline} discontent with the
present political order. On the other hand, [this]{.underline}
'postmodern' [geopolitical imagination]{.underline} (ibid.) [has
been]{.underline} very often [**subdued** to the]{.underline} much more
traditional and ['modern' vision of a '**new Cold War**' between
**Russia** and '**the West**']{.underline} (for critical analyses of
this discourse see Browning, 2018; Ciută & Klinke, 2010; Toal, 2017).
Thereby, [HW has been **incorporated** into the **civilisational
mode**]{.underline} of geopolitical thinking [that divides the world
along an **East**/**West axis**]{.underline}.

Approaching HW as a case of anxiety geopolitics allows us to analyse
this tension and unpack the underlying puzzle: [Why is it
that]{.underline} the ostensibly novel, networked and deterritorialised
phenomena associated with [hybrid warfare get so **easily submerged**
under such an **old**, **static**]{.underline} and territorial
[**geopolitical imagination**?]{.underline} We argue that [the allure of
**East**/**West geopolitics** lies in its **familiarity**, as it
provides a]{.underline} well-worn [**map** that promises to '**make
sense**' of]{.underline} the [anxiety-inducing]{.underline}
manifestations of **['hybrid warfare']{.underline}**. Yet, [we **also
show** that these attempts]{.underline} eventually [**fail**
and]{.underline} the [HW discourse ends up **perpetuating**]{.underline}
the [**insecurities** and **anxieties**]{.underline}, which it was
supposed to resolve. As such, [it serves]{.underline} well to ['a
'**hybrid-industrial complex**' of government **agencies**,
**think-tanks**,]{.underline} non-governmental organizations
(**[NGOs]{.underline}**) [and **pundits'**]{.underline} that emerged
around it (Galeotti, 2019, p. 11). By pointing out to the role of
anxiety geopolitics in this economy of power/knowledge that emerged
around HW, this article provides both an analysis and a political
intervention.

Bringing the argument together, [by]{.underline} the notion of [anxiety
geopolitics we conceptualise the **politics of**]{.underline} dealing
with [**anxiety** by linking it to objects]{.underline} and issues
[spatialised through]{.underline} the means of **[geopolitical
imaginations]{.underline}**. By references to geographical categories,
such as states, regions, continents or civilisations, [this]{.underline}
type of [**affective geopolitics** promises to transform]{.underline}
the **[amorphous]{.underline}** and ambiguous **[anxiety]{.underline}**
stemming from range of different issues [into **tangible**]{.underline}
and manageable [**objects** of **fear** taking the form of
**geopolitical threats**]{.underline}. Yet, [as]{.underline} all [such
narratives]{.underline} and images [are **ultimately bound** to fail to
resolve]{.underline} the underlying [**anxiety**, the]{.underline}
analytical [focus must]{.underline} be [extend]{.underline}ed also [to
how]{.underline} these failures are accounted for and how [anxiety
is]{.underline} being further [**reproduced** with]{.underline} the help
of **[geopolitical imaginations]{.underline}**. Therefore, [**anxiety
geopolitics** is]{.underline} ultimately [about]{.underline} the
[oscillation between **repressing anxiety**]{.underline} through the
geopoliticisation of both the 'threat' and the self, [as much as it
is]{.underline} about [dealing with]{.underline} the recurring
[**failures** to **secure**]{.underline} the **[subjects]{.underline}**
produced by such geopoliticisation[, which result in **reproduction** of
**social anxiety**]{.underline}.

3\. Hybrid warfare as anxiety geopolitics: learning from the Czech case

[We]{.underline} will now further develop our conceptual argument by
[discuss]{.underline}ing [hybrid warfare as a **case** of **anxiety
geopolitics**]{.underline}. Some have already shown that [HW plays an
**ontological security role** at the level of **NATO**]{.underline} and
EU, [as it 'links]{.underline} the [uncertainty]{.underline} emanating
[from]{.underline} the **[hybrid]{.underline}** nature of the new
[**threats** to the]{.underline} known and [**routine relationship**
with its]{.underline} traditional [antagonist', that is
**Russia**]{.underline} (**[Mälksoo]{.underline}**, 2018, p. 380).
Following this argument, [Russia\'s aggression]{.underline} suddenly
[gave meaning to]{.underline} a range of hitherto unconnected, yet
omnipresent, and, therefore, [anxiety-inducing problems]{.underline}
that **[NATO]{.underline}**, EU and their [**member states** were
**facing**. **Polarisation** and the rise of **populism**,]{.underline}
widespread [**distrust** in institutions, **erosion** of **international
norms**, **cyberattacks**, **propaganda** and **disinformation**
campaigns]{.underline} suddenly [all '**made sense**', if they could
be]{.underline} discursively [linked to **Moscow** as instances of
'**Russian hybrid warfare'**. HW]{.underline} thus [provided
NATO]{.underline} and EU, [with]{.underline} the elusive ['security' of
knowing one\'s enemy]{.underline} (also Browning, 2018).

Similarly, in Czechia, the [HW]{.underline} discourse [arrived at a time
of]{.underline} intense **[social anxieties]{.underline}** emerging from
a range of different cultural, economic or geopolitical factors. For
many in Czechia (and Central Europe more broadly), [post-Cold
War]{.underline} sense of [ontological security had been provided
through a]{.underline} civilisational [**geopolitical imagination** of
'**the West**']{.underline}, which Central Europe supposedly (re)joined
after 1989 (Cadier, 2019; Kuus, 2007; Todorova, 2009). Best captured by
the slogan of a 'return to Europe', [the vision of embracing **liberal
democracy**, **capitalism** and **Euro-Atlantic political structures**
was]{.underline} seen as [a **panacea** that]{.underline} would [resolve
**all** big **(geo)political questions** once and for all]{.underline}.
However, [these]{.underline} very principles and
[structures]{.underline} arguably [started **crumbling**]{.underline}
precisely [at the time]{.underline} that the [**Central Europeans**
were]{.underline} finally [admitted in]{.underline} EU and [**NATO**.
The **Iraq War** laid bare]{.underline} the [rifts within the **West**,
calling in question its]{.underline} further [relevance as
a]{.underline} coherent **[geopolitical entity]{.underline}** (Browning
& Lehti, 2010; Jackson, 2006). [Resurgent Russia]{.underline} challenged
Western hegemony in Europe and [led]{.underline} 'an influential part of
the Czech political and intellectual [elite]{.underline}
\[[to]{.underline}\] [succumb]{.underline}\[...\] [to
anxiety]{.underline}' (Drulák, 2012, p. 79). [Central European countries
were hit]{.underline} particularly [hard by]{.underline} the [economic
crisis and]{.underline} further [hurt themselves by the]{.underline}
(foreign- or self-imposed) '[Western' medicine of austerity]{.underline}
(Tooze, 2018, pp. 220--238). In the Czech case, [this led
to]{.underline} one of the longest periods of economic recovery in
Europe, accompanied by [a free-fall in public trust]{.underline} in
institutions, with only one in ten Czechs expressing trust in the
government (11%) and the Chamber of Deputies (10%) at the lowest point
in 2012/2013 (CVVM, 2013). Add to this the rise of illiberalism at home
and increasing divides between the 'old' and 'new' EU member states,
laid bare especially during the so called 'refugee crisis' of
2015--2016. As a consequence, [you end up with a region]{.underline}
that is [not]{.underline} so [sure about]{.underline} its feeling about
and towards ['**the West**' any longer]{.underline} (Kazharski, 2018;
Krastev & Holmes, 2019).

Put differently, by mid-2010s, the Czech [society was]{.underline}
already [in a state of **anxiety** and **uncertainty** about
its]{.underline} own [**geopolitical identity** and in search for
**ontological fixes**]{.underline}.3 [This is where]{.underline} the
[**HW discourse** clicks in following Russia\'s aggression against
**Ukraine** in **2014**]{.underline}. To the liberal voices that
dominate security debates, **[hybrid warfare]{.underline}** could be
used to [put a name on]{.underline} this **[anxiety]{.underline}** and
thereby attempt to [suppress it by the construction of familiar
**geopolitical narratives**. By invoking the **prism of a conflict**
between a **liberal**]{.underline}-democratic [**West** and]{.underline}
an [**authoritarian Russia**, all]{.underline} sorts of [problems --
spread of **misinformation**,]{.underline} return of [**nationalism**,
**technological transformations** or **global power
shifts**]{.underline} -- [could be reduced to the logic of
**civilisational confrontation**]{.underline}. This is the conventional
ontological security part of the story, to which we add another step by
showing how this promise of security is never actually fulfilled. [Due
to the]{.underline} supposed [**invisibility** and **omnipresence** of
**hybrid threats**]{.underline} and the insecure position the Czechs
occupy in their own East/West geopolitical imagination, [there is a
**surplus** of **anxiety** that cannot be]{.underline} successfully
**[managed]{.underline}**.

The case study is structured according to the two 'faces' of the
Janus-faced politics of anxiety. [First,]{.underline} we show how
[**hybrid warfare** was used as a sense-making device]{.underline}
promising [to manage **anxiety** by providing a **conceptual link**
between]{.underline} a broad range of [**social issues** and anchoring
them within the familiar **East/West geopolitical imagination**.
This]{.underline} linking could simultaneously make hybrid warfare
meaningful by geopoliticising it, and [reinforce the crumbling East/West
geopolitical imagination]{.underline} by [showing its renewed relevance
in]{.underline} facing [**hybrid warfare**. Second]{.underline}, we show
how the fleeting sense of [ontological security]{.underline} achieved
via this articulation [gets **undone** by]{.underline} the
[recurring]{.underline} re-emergence of [surplus anxiety]{.underline}
and how [HW ends up **reproducing** and **perpetuating**]{.underline}
the sense of insecurity and [**anxiety** it was supposed to **resolve**.
The **analysis** is grounded in]{.underline} a range of **[empirical
materials]{.underline}** from 2014 to 2020, including official
documents, media articles, popular books and parliamentary debates. Two
caveats are in order. First, both Czech government and civil society
have responded to the perceived threat of HW in many ways, including
creating new official institutions and informal initiatives tailored to
deal with it (Daniel & Eberle, 2018). In this article, we focus on the
discourse that made these responses possible. Second, as shown elsewhere
(Daniel & Eberle, 2021), the Czech HW discourse is not monolithic and
includes different understandings of what exactly constitutes a threat
to whom, ranging from military operations targeting public
infrastructures all the way to individual citizen\'s struggles with
media literacy. In this article, though, we downplay these differences
and instead focus on the commonalities that tie these different notions
together as parts of ostensibly the same problem of Russia\'s 'hybrid
warfare'.

3.1. Repressing anxiety: making sense of hybrid warfare through
East/West geopolitics

Starting with the repression side of **[anxiety
geopolitics]{.underline}**, this [can be observed in]{.underline} the
[successive steps through which **ontological security** is sought by
associating]{.underline} a range of [issues with **hybrid warfare**
and]{.underline} then [pinning **HW** onto the **familiar map** of
**East/West geopolitical imagination**. This consists of
four]{.underline} interrelated discursive [moves: identifying
the]{.underline} supposed '**[origin']{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
societal [unease, putting a **name** of the problem, **localising**
it]{.underline} in space[, and endowing it with]{.underline} broader
**[geopolitical meanings]{.underline}**. In this particular case,
[**Russia\'s invasion** of **Ukraine** in **2014** serves as
the]{.underline} supposed [original moment and '**cause'** of anxiety,
**hybrid warfare** is the **name**]{.underline} presented [to make sense
of what is going on, **Russia** is]{.underline} constructed as [the
**threat**, and **civilisational East/West geopolitics**]{.underline} is
used to [give the situation broader **meaning**]{.underline}. Let us now
discuss each of these steps in turn.

[**First**, a **certain event** needs to be constructed as]{.underline}
a supposed point of [origin of]{.underline} the perceived [unease, a
'**crisis'** that dislocates]{.underline} the [symbolic
order]{.underline} (Nabers, 2015). This is the first move in the
repression of anxiety, one in which an 'actually existing' empirical
event is discursively presented as the apparent cause of the deeper
ontological crisis that is affectively experienced as anxiety. In the HW
discourse in Czechia, [Russia\'s aggression against **Ukraine** of
**2014** is presented as such]{.underline} profoundly shocking and
dislocating event. As the otherwise rather down-to-earth and
matter-of-fact military intellectual, Karel Řehka, puts it: 'the Russian
Federation shocked the whole world. The unimaginable was broken into.'
(Řehka, 2017, p. 199) 'Shock' and 'helplessness' are words used also by
a high-ranking Czech diplomat (personal interview, Prague, August 4,
2020). A leading Czech think-tanker then recalls how 'surprised' he was
by Russia\'s invasion and how 'disorganised and fragmented' the security
debates were in the months that followed (Janda, 2017). The affective
experience is captured well also in a widely cited and circulated
popular book, which vividly describes how 'we are walking on the edge of
a cliff' and '\[u\]ncertainty is the only thing that you can count on
these days' (Alvarová, 2017, p. 20). Therefore, [2014 was]{.underline}
constructed as [a **radical breakthrough** into a]{.underline} much
[more **insecure world**]{.underline}. Yet, this move of [identifying
the]{.underline} supposed [**origin** of]{.underline} these dizzying
feelings of [anxiety in **one**]{.underline} particular [**event**
was]{.underline} at the same time already the first step of [seeking
**ontological security** by making sense of it.]{.underline}

[A **second step** is putting the **name** on the
**problem**]{.underline}. It is only the performative and affect-laden
performance of **[naming]{.underline}** that [connects disparate
phenomena]{.underline} together [and creates a **discursive 'object'**
that can be]{.underline} then [dealt with]{.underline} politically
(Laclau, 2005). In our case, [this leads to]{.underline} the creative
appropriation of the [concepts of '**hybrid warfare**' and '**hybrid
threats**', which were]{.underline} virtually [non-existent
in]{.underline} the Czech public [discourse prior to 2014]{.underline}
(Daniel & Eberle, 2018), [and using them as a **linchpin** that
connects]{.underline} all sorts of **[societal problems]{.underline}**.
For an authoritative Czech security document, 'hybrid threat' is a 'way
to wage a confrontation or a conflict', one that is characterised by an
extraordinarily broad spectrum of measures: 'a wide, complex, adaptable,
and integrated combination of conventional and unconventional means,
overt and covert activities, characterised primarily by coercion and
subversion' (Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic, 2016, p.
127). The range of actors that can execute such methods is similarly
broad, including 'military, paramilitary, and various civilian actors'
(ibid.). Similarly, an overview of a 'Russian hybrid strategy' provided
by the counterintelligence service includes 'interpretation of modern
history', different ways of 'information warfare',
'networking/infiltration' across the fields of politics, economy, crime,
espionage, culture and education, and military/guerrilla operations
alike (Security Information Service, 2018, p. 7). In statements like
these, [hybrid warfare is **stretched**]{.underline} so as [to
incorporate]{.underline} almost [anything that can be understood
as]{.underline} a **[hostile]{.underline}** activity. A such, [it
becomes a]{.underline}n [**universal object** of **fear**]{.underline},
broad enough [to be]{.underline} used as [a **placeholder** for
all]{.underline} sorts of [anxieties]{.underline}.

In the **[third]{.underline}** move[, hybrid warfare is
**territorialised** by pointing to **Russia** as its]{.underline}
ultimate [source. The '**postmodern**' geopolitical imagination of
**hybrid warfare** in]{.underline} terms of [**flows**, **clouds** and
**infrastructures**, is backgrounded in favour of the '**modern**'
territorial **East/West geopolitics** of a **Russian
threat**]{.underline}. In certain cases, this means little more than
merely pointing out that [it is]{.underline} indeed [**Russia**
that]{.underline} 'has [executed **hybrid operations**]{.underline} \[
...\], [including]{.underline} targeted [disinformation]{.underline}
activities [and **cyber-attacks**]{.underline}', as the Defence Strategy
(Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic, 2017, p. 7) puts it
explicitly and other documents hint at implicitly (e.g. Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, 2015). More interesting are the
[instances]{.underline} which [present Russia not only as **one source**
of threats, but as an **orchestrator** coordinating all]{.underline}
possible [**means** and **actors**]{.underline}. In such cases,
[the]{.underline} 'postmodern' geopolitical [imagination of **networks**
is used]{.underline} and reproduced, yet [with a]{.underline} key
[**twist**: such networks are]{.underline} seen as [hierarchical, with
centre in **Moscow**]{.underline}. In this logic, different [domestic
actors]{.underline} -- 'alternative news' websites [spreading
**anti-Western** narratives, right-wing populists]{.underline}, even
contrarian intellectuals -- [can]{.underline} ultimately [be tied
to]{.underline} an overall [Russia\'s **masterplan**]{.underline} (for
an example see Janda & Kundra, 2016). The counterintelligence agency
reports are an example of this 'puppet-master' approach. One of them
lists 'covert infiltration of Czech media and the Internet' and
'foundation of puppet organizations, covert and open support of populist
or extremist subjects' among the key activities of Russia\'s
'information operations' (Security Information Service, 2016, p. 9).
Another outlines this logic in colourful detail, claiming that 'Russia
is creating a structure in Europe drawing on the concept of the
Comintern (the Communist International; the Third International) founded
by the Soviet Union' (Security Information Service, 2015, p. 11), an
organised network of all sorts of actors 'with pro-Russian stances or
fighting against the system' (ibid., 12).

However, different [actors can be labelled]{.underline} as
[agents]{.underline} or instrument [of **HW** and]{.underline} then
[**geopoliticised** and linked to Russia]{.underline} not only by direct
association, but also [because they are]{.underline} merely [voicing
**opinions** that can be]{.underline} somehow qualified as
'**[pro-Russian]{.underline}**'. As a more recent counterintelligence
report puts it, actually an 'overwhelming majority of disinformation
websites in Czech are the work of Czech \[...\] citizens, who are not
supported by Russian entities.' (Security Information Service, 2018, p.
8) Nevertheless, [this]{.underline} still [makes them a **part** of
a]{.underline} broader [**geopolitical threat**, as 'these
people]{.underline} and their internet projects [are **misused** by
Russia to spread **propaganda** or support]{.underline} other components
of the **[hybrid strategy.]{.underline}**' (ibid., 8) It is [this
imagination]{.underline} of a Russian-orchestrated networked threat that
enables a leading Czech journalist to blankly dismiss the prominent
disinformation website, Aeronet. cz, as 'writing for Putin' (Kundra,
2016b), without any evidence of links to the Russian state known at that
point and with his own subsequent investigations showing that this is
most likely not the case. It also [makes it possible to deal with
**anxieties** by externalising the problem]{.underline}, such as when a
popular book argues that 'Furious hate \[...\] is not Czech, it is
something new, foreign. It came from the outside and 'somehow' entered
into us.' (Alvarová, 2017, p. 88).

In the **[fourth]{.underline}** and final move[, this '**hybrid**'
struggle with Russia is endowed with **meaning** by being inserted
into]{.underline} the whole symbolic structure of [**East/West
civilisational geopolitics**, in which]{.underline} '\[i\]ssues of
[security and geopolitics are]{.underline} \[...\] [reframed in cultural
terms]{.underline}. They become simultaneously geographical, cultural
and strategic concepts, and they diffuse into ever more spheres of
political life.' (Kuus, 2007, p. x) [The]{.underline} societal
[anxieties that are **managed** via]{.underline} the narrative of
[**hybrid warfare** emanating from **Russia**, are]{.underline} now also
made [part of an **eternal struggle** between the **East** and the
**West**. This reactivates]{.underline} the '**[mental
maps]{.underline}**', [in which 'the West' functions as a]{.underline}
desired point of identification and a [promise of **security** and
**prosperity**, whereas 'the East' is]{.underline} seen as ['an
**abyss**']{.underline}, a notion 'which in the Czech political
discourse refers less to a geographical space than to ontological
categories defining the alienated past of the Czech Republic.' (Cadier,
2019, p. 84) As one member of parliament, Jan Bartošek, put it, the
Czechs are left with an unequivocal choice: 'either we will be part of
NATO as a firm ally of our pro-Western orientation, or we will be just
one of Russia\'s many colonies. There is no third way.' (in Chamber of
Deputies, 2018a).

In statements like these, [Russia is presented as]{.underline} a
**[fundamentally different]{.underline}** entity[,]{.underline} a
[quintessentially **Oriental**]{.underline} actor, [belonging to a
**different 'universe'** that]{.underline} 'until nowadays [has not
met]{.underline}' [with the European one]{.underline} (Alvarová, 2017,
p. 70). [Echoing classical **Orientalist tropes**, Russians]{.underline}
supposedly [rely on]{.underline} '\[m\]ysticism,
**[irrationality]{.underline}**, associational [instead of **logical
thinking**]{.underline} -- thus, a model of thinking that is of
different civilisation, the one we know rather from the Orient'
(Alvarová, 2017, p. 193). [The]{.underline} potentially [**catastrophic
consequences** of allying with Russia are]{.underline} then often
[presented through]{.underline} references to [**the past**,
reinforcing]{.underline} the notion [that what is at stake in **HW**
is]{.underline} in fact yet another instance of [a **historical
struggle** between **civilisations**]{.underline}. 'Many of us probably
know our modern history, from 1945 through 1948, Russian advisers, death
of \[foreign minister\] Jan Masaryk, occupation in 1968. The Russian
influence, which simply broke us away from the West, ripped us from
\[our\] democratic development, and has incalculable economic
consequences stretching to this day.' (Helena Langšádlová in Chamber of
Deputies, 2018b).

This idea [that issues like **propaganda**, **misinformation**
or]{.underline} rise of [**populism** are instances of a]{.underline}
dramatic **[geopolitical confrontation]{.underline}**, [is]{.underline}
finally [driven home]{.underline} also [by the notion]{.underline} that
[it is the **West**]{.underline} as a whole [that is under attack, not
just an]{.underline}y [individual **country**]{.underline}. According to
a counterintelligence report, 'the goal of the Russian hybrid campaign'
is 'primarily to weaken NATO and the EU internally, e.g. by weakening
individual member states' (Security Information Service, 2018, p. 7).
Therefore, should the Czechs fail to defend themselves, they are
supposedly endangering something much bigger. According to a member of
parliament, Jan Lipavský, what the Russians want is 'to break European
unity' (Chamber of Deputies, 2018b). [Such]{.underline} ideas [connect
**hybrid warfare** squarely to]{.underline} the [**Messianistic
undertones** of the **East/West geopolitical imagination**, in
which]{.underline} the [Central Europeans serve as **guardians**
defending the **West** at its limit]{.underline}. To paraphrase Milan
Kundera\'s (1984) foundational essay on Central European civilisational
geopolitics, by [fighting hybrid warfare]{.underline}, the Czechs are
[risk]{.underline}ing '[dying for]{.underline} Czechia and [the
West]{.underline}', [which]{.underline} indeed [gives a sense
of]{.underline} deep [**purpose** and **meaning**]{.underline} to their
cause [and produces a]{.underline} strong [anxiety-repressing
narrative]{.underline}.

To sum up this part, one important aspect of the [anxiety geopolitics of
**hybrid warfare**]{.underline} lies in the way how it allows
[channel]{.underline}ling [deep]{.underline}er [anxieties]{.underline}
by [using the **East/West** **geopolitical imagination** to produce
**familiar storylines**, **identities** and **objects** of
**fear**.]{.underline} Despite being constructed as multifaceted, broad
and difficult to detect, [hybrid warfare is made **legible** by being
projected on a]{.underline} familiar '**[mental map]{.underline}**'[,
where it becomes]{.underline} merely [the]{.underline} most [recent
instance of]{.underline} long-lasting [**struggle** between the **West**
and]{.underline} a fundamentally different, antagonist
**[Russia]{.underline}**. However, [the relationship
between]{.underline} the discourses of [**hybrid warfare** and
**East/West geopolitics** goes **both ways**: HW]{.underline} is not
only territorialised by, but also **[gives]{.underline}** broader
[**meaning** to and]{.underline}, in a way, [**promises** to
**reinforce**]{.underline} the [**East/West civilisational
geopolitics**. It is]{.underline} in and [through HW that Russia is
constructed as **fundamentally different** and the **West** presented as
a **coherent entity** under **attack**, as well as something worth
**defending**]{.underline} against the potentially tragic alternatives.
[Through]{.underline} the discourse of [**hybrid warfare**, doubts
about]{.underline} the relevance or [resilience of a **West-centric
geopolitical order** are]{.underline} seemingly [**brushed away**
and]{.underline} old [**geopolitical identities** are **hardened**. This
is]{.underline} precisely [the logic of **ontological security** that
makes the]{.underline} ideas of a '[**return** of
**geopolitics**]{.underline}' [and the '**new Cold War**' so
**appealing**]{.underline}, as shown by Guzzini (2012, 2016) and
Browning (2018).

3.2. Reproducing anxiety: danger is everywhere and the East is already
within

The [HW]{.underline} discourse arguably [succeeds on]{.underline} the
level of [**meaning**, that is in '**making sense**' of]{.underline} the
[new threats by geopoliticising them in **East/West
terms**]{.underline}. In contrast, [its success is]{.underline} only
**[fleeting]{.underline}** at best [as an **anxiety-repressing
ontological fix**]{.underline}. In this section, [we focus on the
**other face** of **anxiety geopolitics**, showing how]{.underline} the
**[HW]{.underline}** discourse also [contributes to the **reproduction**
of **anxiety**]{.underline}. The argument that security discourses end
up perpetuating the very insecurity they promise to deal with is not new
(e.g. Campbell, 1998). More recently, Heath-Kelly (2018) and Jacobsen
(2020) have advanced it from an explicitly Lacanian perspective and
shown how the discourses of terrorism and cybersecurity are inherently
bound to disappoint the underlying desire for security. The endurance of
these discourses is made possible by the way how they pre-emptively
incorporate an explanation for their own failure. [**Terrorism** and
**cyberthreats** are constructed in]{.underline} such [a **broad**,
**complex** and **omnipresent manner** that no **individual
achievement** can lead to the **resolution** of the
**problems**]{.underline} presented by these discourses. [There
are]{.underline} always [**new risks** and **vulnerabilities**, as the
destruction]{.underline} or neutralisation [of no]{.underline} actually
[existing objects of fear]{.underline} (e.g. Osama bin Laden)
[can]{.underline} ultimately [satisfy]{.underline} the [underlying
**ontological anxieties**. There is]{.underline} always [something
**else** to **worry about**]{.underline}.

Building on Heath-Kelly and Jacobsen, our final argument is that [hybrid
warfare]{.underline} works exactly like their examples, as HW, too, [is
a **discourse** that is]{.underline} simultaneously
[anxiety-**repressing** and anxiety-**reproducing**]{.underline}. In
fact, [we argue]{.underline} that the [linking]{.underline} of [HW and
**East/West geopolitics** produces a]{.underline} particularly [strongly
**anxiety-ridden discourse**. While hybrid warfare presents threats as
**invisible** and **omnipresent** due to their **covert** and
**networked nature**, the **East/West imagination**]{.underline} further
[raises the **stakes** and **salience** of]{.underline} such [threats by
painting them as parts of a]{.underline} titanic [**civilisational
struggle**. The subjects produced by]{.underline} such [**discourse**
can never **rest**, as what may be going on right behind their noses is
not]{.underline} just **[one]{.underline}** particular
**[cyber-attack]{.underline}**, a single conspiracy theory that has
gained traction on Facebook, or merely one instance of information
stolen by a spy. Instead, [it is a battle for the **future** of '**the
West**]{.underline}' and the Czech belonging to it[, one where the
**alternative**]{.underline} option [is]{.underline} the most
[tragic]{.underline} one[: a descent]{.underline} deep [into the
'**abyss**' of '**the East**']{.underline} (Cadier, 2019).
[We]{.underline} will now [illustrate these arguments by focusing on the
**unfathomability** of **HW**, the **shifting nature** of]{.underline}
the **[threats]{.underline}** it produces[, and]{.underline} the
[anxieties]{.underline} inherent [in]{.underline} the [East/West
geopolitics that underpin it]{.underline}.

[**First**, the '**failure to secure**']{.underline} (Heath-Kelly, 2015)
[is]{.underline} pre-emptively [incorporated in]{.underline} the [HW
discourse by its portrayal of]{.underline} the [**looming dangers** as
**insidious**, **invisible** and]{.underline} even [**impossible** to
detect]{.underline}. As a key security document states, '\[t\]he
principal risk to which a subject attacked by a hybrid campaign is
exposed lies in the fact that they will not be able to identify the
hybrid campaign -- in time, in its full scale, or at all' (Ministry of
the Interior of the Czech Republic, 2016, p. 129). According to the
deputy Helena Langšádlová, [what we are]{.underline} supposedly
[facing]{.underline} are highly dangerous, yet ['**creeping threats**',
which we 'cannot see on a day by day basis]{.underline}' (in Chamber of
Deputies, 2019). This leads some to claim that 'at no point in history
was it so extremely difficult to decide, if we are at war, or not'
(Táborský, 2019, p. 164). While there may be little drama on the
surface, [no one can ever **rest** in **this logic**. An attack may
be]{.underline} already [**underway**, one that can]{.underline} even
[be approximated to **war**]{.underline}, literally [at **any
minute**]{.underline}. As the Special Forces general, Karel Řehka, put
it at a conference organised in the Czech parliament: 'In a way, we are
already at war, we just do not realise it or are not able to admit it.'
(Lang, 2015) [This]{.underline} is a mode of thinking that [produces
highly **anxious subjects**, in a]{.underline} constant [sense
of]{.underline} the '**[expectant dread]{.underline}**' that is anxiety
(Hook, 2015, p. 117), one not yet having a clear referent and directed
towards all possible yet still unknown dangers that may materialise at
any time.

[It is in these notions that an]{.underline} unspecified [**existential
threat** may be hidden behind **mundane events**]{.underline} that the
otherwise backgrounded 'postmodern' geopolitical imagination of HW
suddenly [kicks back in. If the]{.underline} 'modern' [East/West
geopolitical imagination]{.underline} 'made sense' and
[provided]{.underline} at least [some]{.underline} fleeting [ontological
security]{.underline} by pointing to Russia, [this is **frustrated**
by]{.underline} the [**surplus anxiety** produced via this]{.underline}
'postmodern' [imagination of **insidious**, **hidden networks**
operating in **physical** and **cyberspace**]{.underline} alike. In
fact, as the discourse postulates, [we may not]{.underline} even
[know]{.underline} that [it really is Russia]{.underline} in the first
place [that is behind a]{.underline} particular [incident, as hybrid
attackers]{.underline} seek to [create 'an environment where
responsibility]{.underline} for these activities [cannot]{.underline}
(at least formally) [be **attributed**]{.underline} to them, or at least
only speculatively and with great difficulty' (Ministry of the Interior
of the Czech Republic, 2016, p. 127). We may ultimately never know if
this or that mundane event is actually not a part of something much
bigger, as [it is the]{.underline} very [aim of the attacker to 'prevent
a **clear interpretation** of **events**]{.underline} and the discovery
of their interconnectedness' (Ministry of the Interior of the Czech
Republic, 2016, p. 127). Therefore, while the prevalent 'modern'
geopolitical reading of HW enables channelling anxiety by constructing
Russia an object of fear, it still remains far from the manageable fear
of 'fight or flight' (Kinnvall & Mitzen, 2020, p. 241). This is because
[these]{.underline} supposedly [known aspects]{.underline} of the danger
[are]{.underline} constantly being [accompanied]{.underline} and
disrupted [by]{.underline} the [**surplus anxiety** of the **'unknown
unknowns'** stemming from]{.underline} the partial inclusion of [the
**'postmodern' geopolitical reading**. This]{.underline} effectively
[pre-empts the **HW discourse** from]{.underline} ever
[solving]{.underline} the [problems it is]{.underline} supposedly
[designed to **tackle**, as it is]{.underline} wholly [unclear how to
**act** upon **threats** that we are not]{.underline} yet [aware of or
do not know how to **make sense of**]{.underline}.

[**Second**, this oscillation between]{.underline} the known and the
unknown and between [fear and anxiety manifests]{.underline} itself [in
the]{.underline} constantly [shifting construction of what
is]{.underline} supposed [to be the]{.underline} exact [**nature** of
the **threat** coming from **Russia**.]{.underline} This is best
illustrated in the wording of the annual reports of the Czech
counterintelligence agency (SIS), which reinforce the notion that
[Russia is]{.underline} indeed [a **severe threat**, yet the **precise
character** and **shape** of this threat appears to be
changing]{.underline} year after year. As already mentioned, in first
annual public report reflecting on the situation after Russia\'s
aggression against Ukraine, the SIS warned that their assessment showed
the formation of what was spectacularly labelled as the 'New
Reincarnation of the Comintern' -- a loose network of allied actors,
similar to the Cold War Soviet-controlled network of ideologically
affiliated political parties, agitators and agents. The danger was
portrayed as a new version of this tried and tested strategy, which
Russia supposedly employs to connect different groups dissatisfied with
the Western liberal democracy (Security Information Service, 2015, pp.
11--12).

However, the spectre of the Comintern was a one-off, never to appear
again. Instead, SIS later concluded that the threat resided in a much
looser combination of often uncoordinated actions of Russian
intelligence, authentic Czech individuals not in any way linked to
Moscow but 'only' spreading their own 'pro-Russian' worldviews, and
finally, even in the lack of education about modern history in schools
(Security Information Service, 2018, pp. 6--8). This trend of diffusing
the danger from a Kremlin-coordinated network to seeing the threats in
mere ideological resonances further continued. The most recent report
notes that there is a 'transition from state-controlled or directed
activities to spontaneous actions' of like-minded actors. 'When Russian
state officials express what they desire to happen (for instance by
spreading manipulative information), proxy actors without any links to
the Russian state proceed to action on their own initiative and based on
what they think the officials might want' (Security Information Service,
2020, p. 9).

Through this move, [the spectre of '**Russian hybrid warfare**'
can]{.underline} now [encompass virtually **anything** that can
be]{.underline} somehow [interpreted as matching with the]{.underline}
desires or interests of [the Kremlin, without]{.underline} any need for
[proving **direct links**, as these are no longer]{.underline}
considered [necessary. The **construction** of '**a threat**' now
includes]{.underline} even [situations when 'a foreign power does not
engage in]{.underline} any [**direct action** and keeps its
**distance**]{.underline}, while using various ways (PR, instigating
statements, propaganda etc.) to inspire individual persons to take
action' (Security Information Service, 2020, p. 9). Put differently,
Russian threat can be present even where there is no direct Russian hand
whatsoever. Literally any individual with views somehow similar to those
of the Russian state can be seen as part of it, which makes the idea
that security can ever be achieved virtually impossible. Instead, [this
logic contributes to]{.underline} the reproduction of [an **anxious
society**, defined by 'the constant presence of]{.underline} the
possibility of that [threat, and]{.underline} with it, [the
sense]{.underline} that [government cannot]{.underline} fully
[protect]{.underline} the [people]{.underline} and that danger resides
in the everyday' (Kinnvall & Mitzen, 2020, p. 247).

Third, this notion that the possibility that something 'Russian' may be
insidiously present deep within the Czech society then revives also the
old anxieties inherent in the 'modern' East/West geopolitical
imagination itself. Central Europeans\' self-positioning in East/West
geopolitics is highly ambivalent (Kuus, 2007; Todorova, 2009). On the
one hand, being or becoming part of 'the Western civilisation' is a
source of ontological security. On the other hand, this security is
never quite complete or permanent. This is because Central Europeans
locate themselves at the very limit of the West, as 'European edge-men'
(Mälksoo, 2010, p. 5), whose membership in the civilisation must
constantly be proved as it can always be taken away -- especially by the
forces of the 'East'. The 'old shadow of Yalta', the feeling that the
region\'s 'freedom could yet again be expendable in times of crisis' is
constantly present (Mälksoo, 2010, p. 75). Put differently, East/West
geopolitics equips the Czech 'pro-Western' security intellectuals with a
'mental map, where the country is depicted as being on the "edge" of
Europe and constantly risking to "fall" into an abyss \[...\]
traditionally characterised as the "East"' (Cadier, 2019, p. 84). While
the East/West geopolitical imagination can succeed in spatialising the
threat in the Russian 'other', the position it grants to the self is
always potentially insecure. Therefore, it is also East/West geopolitics
itself that produces subjects that are constantly on alert, facing the
constant 'possibility of loss of one\'s soul' (Balaska, 2019, p. 8) that
defines the experience of anxiety.

Such [fragile **geopolitical self-positioning**]{.underline} further
[fuels the search for **new** and **new sources** of **hybrid
threats**]{.underline}, as failing to uncover and face them may have
existential consequences, especially given that 'Easternness' may have
already infiltrated and compromised the Czech social body. This notion
of 'East within' links to the above discussed unfathomability and
invisibility of HW and manifests itself in multiple ways. For one
counterintelligence report, it takes the form of smuggled ideas and
narratives, presented 'in a way leading Czech citizens to believe they
are recipients of opinions held by fellow citizens not of Russian
propaganda' (Security Information Service, 2015, p. 11). Similarly, a
popular book on 'fake news' geopoliticises social attitudes en bloc by
identifying them along East/West axis, presenting the 'disappointed'
part of society as 'seeing a model in Russia, or perhaps China' (Gregor,
Mlejnková, & Zvolsi.info, 2018, p. 62). For others, the 'East within'
takes the form in the physical presence of 'Putin\'s agents' who
supposedly 'quite likely teach your children at universities, you meet
them for a coffee in your favourite café or work in normal jobs.'
(Kundra, 2016a, p. 88).

[The **anxiety geopolitics** of **hybrid warfare** is]{.underline} thus
also [about **creating** the]{.underline} normatively [highly disturbing
'"**red** under **every bed**" mentality']{.underline} (Fridman, 2018,
p. 3) [and applying 'the ethics of **total war**]{.underline} \[...\]
[even to the **smallest skirmish**']{.underline} (Galeotti, 2019, p. 8).
Therefore, [viewing **security threats** through]{.underline} the prism
of [**hybrid warfare** reproduces a **highly anxious society** and
perpetuates]{.underline} the [justification for those '**intellectuals**
of **statecraft**']{.underline} (Ó Tuathail & Agnew, 1992) [that would
not hesitate to provide]{.underline} the sort of **[geopolitical
fixes]{.underline}** that were discussed in the previous sections.
Thereby, [the discourse ends up **reproducing itself**, as the **two
faces** of **anxiety geopolitics**]{.underline} not only disrupt, but
also [dialectically reinforce one another: geopolitical discourse
emerges to **repress anxiety** and provide **ontological security**, yet
the anxiety inherent in the discourse **disrupts ontological security**
and]{.underline}, to come full circle, [creates the need for
**geopolitical discourses**]{.underline}. The result is a society
oscillating between its desire to avoid anxiety and the repeated
frustration thereof; an affective pulsation that has arguably been
elevated to a dominant mode of politics of (in)security in our present
time (Eklundh et al., 2017), of which [hybrid warfare is a **prime
example**]{.underline}. As similar patterns of anxious over-reaction and
securitisation of broad areas of social life have been recognised by
authors writing about HW in different empirical contexts (Fridman, 2018;
Galeotti, 2019; Mälksoo, 2018; Ördén, 2019), we believe that the problem
with 'hybrid warfare' is of a more general nature and the relevance of
our analysis reaches beyond the Czech case.

4\. Conclusion

Introducing anxiety geopolitics as a conceptual linchpin between
disparate arguments from debates on critical geopolitics, ontological
security, and politics of anxiety, this article made two central
contributions. First, we have theorised the relationship between
geopolitics and anxiety, moving beyond the existing accounts above all
by pointing out the Janus-faced character of anxiety geopolitics, in
which anxiety is both repressed and reproduced. Second, using the case
of Czechia, we have argued that hybrid warfare is a discourse that
constantly oscillates between repressing anxiety by geopoliticising the
source of danger in East/West terms, and subverting its own
constructions by presenting the threats as insidious, invisible, and
constantly shifting. Therefore, [we contend]{.underline} that the [HW
discourse is **structured** in a way that cannot achieve its **purported
ambition** to secure populations against '**hybrid threats**'
and]{.underline} instead [ends up **producing more insecurity** and
**anxiety**.]{.underline}

[Our argument has clear **normative implications** that
expand]{.underline} the existing [criticisms of **HW** by
putting]{.underline} the [underlying **civilisational geopolitics** in
**spotlight**]{.underline}. This should help us challenge the
technology-centred presentism of the HW discourse, [showing]{.underline}
that [many]{.underline} of the [ostensibly **unprecedented** concerns
are]{.underline} in fact [**reheated** versions of **narratives** that
date back]{.underline} decades if not **[centuries]{.underline}**. More
importantly, [it enables us to point to]{.underline} the presence of
some of the [**highly problematic aspects** of **East/West thinking**,
especially those that have been]{.underline} rightly [criticised as
**Orientalist**, **chauvinist** or]{.underline} even
**[racist]{.underline}** (see e.g. Said, 1978; Todorova, 2009).
[Realising]{.underline} the presence of [civilisational geopolitics
makes it possible to ask whether]{.underline} certain [portrayals of
**Russia** in **HW debates**]{.underline} -- e.g. [as **barbaric**,
**irrational**, **irredeemable**]{.underline} -- [may not represent
**narcissistic projections** of the **'Western' self**, rather than
**credible threat assessments**]{.underline} (Chernobrov, 2019).
Importantly, [these are not **scholastic matters** of **concern** just
for **ivory-tower peaceniks**]{.underline}, as the proponents of HW
sometimes like to put it. Instead, [these criticisms have **clear
implications** for **security policy**]{.underline}. As recognised even
among NATO\'s own analysts and officials (Caliskan & Liégeois, 2020;
Rühle, 2019), [adopting the prism of **HW** and labelling Russia as
an]{.underline} inherently [**irrational enemy** is detrimental
to]{.underline} leading [**a productive debate** on]{.underline} the
exact nature of [the challenges]{.underline} that [Putin\'s regime
**poses**]{.underline} [and **formulating**]{.underline} appropriate and
[**efficient strategies** to respond to it]{.underline}. We add to it by
highlighting that the [HW discourse not only '**undermines strategic
thinking**']{.underline} (Caliskan & Liégeois, 2020), [but]{.underline}
also [never]{.underline} actually [manages to provide **security** and
creates]{.underline} highly concerning societal side-effects
([perpetuation of **anxiety**, proliferation of **Orientalist
images**]{.underline}).

There are also important qualifications of our argument and avenues for
further research. First of all, we certainly do not claim that everyone
who ever spoke of 'hybrid threats' or 'hybrid warfare' would find
themselves in agreement with the examples used in our analysis, or be
instantly guilty of Orientalism. While the article focused on
overarching themes, there is certainly variation within the HW
discourse, not only in Czechia (Daniel & Eberle, 2021), but also in
Germany, UK or EU (Janičatová & Mlejnková, 2021; Monsees, 2020; Ördén,
2019). One intriguing possibility for further research is in showing the
variation in the way how geopolitical thought is invoked and anxiety
repressed and reproduced within the different versions of the HW
discourse. More generally, the theoretical argument should also be tried
and developed in other contexts.

### Link\-\--Hybrid War\-\--Anxiety Inevitable

#### Anxiety is [inevitable]{.underline}. It is [impossible]{.underline} maintain a [stable]{.underline}, [coherent identity]{.underline}. That [turns case]{.underline}\-\--ontological insecurity drives [ineffectual policy fixes]{.underline}.

Both [Guzzini]{.underline} and Browning [are **critical** of using
**geopolitics** as a tool of **anxiety management**, citing]{.underline}
its [adverse effects]{.underline} both [in **normative
terms**]{.underline} (creation of enemy-images, building an exclusionary
'Fortress Europe'), [and in]{.underline} the [consequential decrease in
**physical security**]{.underline} (e.g. [as a result of]{.underline}
escalating [tensions between **antagonists** locked]{.underline}-in
[in]{.underline} their **[hardened identities]{.underline}**). [However,
both]{.underline} also appear to [ground their argument in]{.underline}
the [assumption that **anxiety**]{.underline} ultimately [can be
**managed**]{.underline} (more or less) successfully, one that is shared
by the Giddensian mainstream of ontological security studies. While
scholars making such arguments would consider the price of
anxiety-management via geopolitics as too steep, they still accept that
such a trade-off can be made in the first place and that one\'s
ontological security can in fact be gained at the expense of physical
security or the well-being of others. As some of the most recent debates
in ontological security scholarship recognise (Browning, 2019; Cash,
2020; Gustafsson & Krickel-Choi, 2020; Kinnvall & Mitzen, 2020;
Rumelili, 2020), these issues stem from Giddens\' problematic
conceptualisation of anxiety that is adopted by most ontological
security work in critical geopolitics and IR. [To sharpen]{.underline}
the [analysis of]{.underline} the role of [**anxiety** in
**geopolitics** and deepen the **critique**]{.underline} made by Guzzini
and Browning[, an **additional** theoretical **step** is
**needed**.]{.underline}

For this purpose, [we reach to]{.underline} the [literature
on]{.underline} the politics of [anxiety drawing]{.underline} mainly
[on]{.underline} the work of Jacques **[Lacan]{.underline}**, a
psychoanalyst whose ideas have been increasingly prolific in IR (for an
authoritative overview see Zevnik & Mandelbaum, 2021), and, to a lesser
extent, critical geopolitics (Klinke, 2016; Laketa, 2019; Müller, 2013).
Our approach shares the Giddensian notion that [anxiety is an
inarticulable]{.underline}, traumatic and potentially paralysing [affect
that subjects]{.underline} attempt to [**avoid** and **repress**.
**However**,]{.underline} instead of seeing it as merely something that
'lurks' behind as the dark other of normal life, [anxiety
is]{.underline} understood as [a **durable affective condition**
interwoven in **everyday experiences** as well as **social processes**
and **political institutions**]{.underline}. It doesn\'t just lurk, [it
is **always already there**, as it is **present**]{.underline} in the
key mechanisms that hold society together: in [the production of
**social subjects** and]{.underline} the creation of [**rules** through
which these are **regulated** and **bound together**]{.underline}.

In this reading, [anxiety is correlative to the]{.underline} very
[**emergence** and **existence** of the **subject**]{.underline} as
such. [It is 'a]{.underline} type of **[expectant dread']{.underline}**
or 'a crushing experience of 'out of placeness'' [that arises 'when the
**subject**, unable to ground themselves in]{.underline} either
[a]{.underline} functional [horizon of **values** or a **reliable
social** or **subjective identification**, fears]{.underline} that [they
might be]{.underline} somehow [**swallowed up, devoured**']{.underline}
(Hook, 2015, pp. 117, 119). [It is less about]{.underline} the
disorientation and [uncertainty caused by **one**]{.underline}
particular **[crisis]{.underline}** (e.g. Russia invading Ukraine,
Covid-19 arriving) [and more about]{.underline} being reminded of
[the]{.underline} ultimately [**irreducible fragility** of **all
things**, including **human lives** and **social orders**]{.underline}.
In this sense, [anxiety is]{.underline} an affect [linked to
experiencing the limit of one\'s]{.underline} own [existence as a
**subject**, something that signifies the **encounter** with '**the
real**']{.underline}, to use the Lacanian term for the internal limit of
social order and/or the biological limit of human existence. [Anxiety
can **never be**]{.underline} fully [**managed** or **repressed**, as it
is a reaction to]{.underline} being confronted with what is for Lacan
[the]{.underline} ultimate [**reality** of]{.underline} human
[**existence**: the]{.underline} fundamental **['groundlessness of
meaning']{.underline}** (Balaska, 2019, p. 25) [and]{.underline},
therefore, [the **impossibility** of]{.underline} ever [achieving a
**coherent** and **stable identity**]{.underline}. In this sense,
anxiety is the affect that 'does not deceive' (Lacan, 2014, p. 160), as
it does not cover over the void at the heart of every social identity,
but rather confronts us with it at the level of bodily sensation. To put
it differently, [subjects are **always**]{.underline} ultimately
[**ontologically insecure**, as **no narratives**]{.underline}, routines
or relationships -- [**personal** or **geopolitical**]{.underline} --
[can ever]{.underline} fully [deal with the]{.underline} omnipresent
[possibility that **things** may not **make sense** and everything can
**break down any minute**. Anxiety emerges as]{.underline} the affect
that signifies 'the need for the **[stabilisation]{.underline}** of the
subject' (Burgess, 2017, p. 29), [yet this **stabilisation** is **doomed
to fail**]{.underline} in the longer term.

Therefore, in contrast to readings that see it as an aberration,
[anxiety is **omnipresent**, even though it]{.underline} clearly [varies
in]{.underline} its [**intensity** across **time** and
**space**]{.underline}. Sometimes it is experienced more often and more
strongly, while there may be other, less anxious times (Solomon, 2012
makes this argument with respect to affects in general). [The
current]{.underline} social [condition is]{.underline} arguably [one
when anxiety is]{.underline} on the **[high]{.underline}**; leading some
authors to argue that we are now living in an 'anxious society', 'a
society on constant alert, [despite having no identifiable **existential
threat**]{.underline}. Instead, [there is the]{.underline} constant
[presence of the **possibility** of that **threat**]{.underline}, and
with it, the sense that government cannot fully protect the people and
that danger resides in the everyday' (Kinnvall & Mitzen, 2020, p. 247,
emph. added; Eklundh et al., 2017). [Such]{.underline} (highly) anxious
society [was created by]{.underline} the congruence of [a **range** of
**factors**. Some point to]{.underline} the effects of
[**neoliberalism** and **austerity**]{.underline} that produce the
widespread feelings of powerlessness and loss of control (Hirvonen,
2017). [Others focus on]{.underline} the **[social media]{.underline}**
economy that requires users who are constantly obsessively checking for
news updates, notifications and the affective gratification coming from
'retweets' and 'likes' (Davies, 2019). [For]{.underline} yet
[others,]{.underline} the proliferation of [anxiety is connected
to]{.underline} the societal changes linked to [**gender**, **race** and
**immigration**]{.underline} (Ali & Whitham, 2018; Klinke, 2016; Zevnik,
2017b), [or]{.underline} the [**'security creep'** perpetuated by
discourses]{.underline} and practices [of **counterterrorism** and
**cybersecurity**]{.underline} (Heath-Kelly, 2018; Jacobsen, 2020).

This extended understanding of anxiety as ontologically conditioned and
socially circulated 'nervous states' (Davies, 2019) without a clear and
concrete referent object opens the possibility to think (geo)politics of
anxiety in broader and arguably more critical terms than in conventional
ontological security literature. On the one hand, [the **Lacanian
approach**]{.underline} broadly [**agrees** with the
Giddensian]{.underline} ontological security [framework with respect to
how **subjects**]{.underline} try to [**deal with anxiety**: by
'**pinning**' it onto an **object** and transforming it into
a]{.underline} more [**tangible fear** of **something**]{.underline}. In
this manner, 'fear becomes a way of easing anxiety; of attaching a
signifier (an object of fear) to what is otherwise an unfounded
experience of unease' (Zevnik, 2017a, p. 237). [Such '**politics of
fear'**]{.underline} then [transforms]{.underline} the crushing and
paralysing experience of [anxiety into the management of '**concrete
objects**]{.underline} that [we]{.underline} have
[invented']{.underline} (Hirvonen, 2017, p. 261), [such as]{.underline}
the geopolitically coded [**'Muslim terrorists'** or **'Russians
hackers'**]{.underline}. In this step, [anxiety is]{.underline}
ostensibly [eased]{.underline} or repressed [by]{.underline} the
[production of]{.underline} (geopolitical) [narratives that '**make
sense**' of the]{.underline} unpleasant [experience by giving it a
**name** and placing it on a **map**.]{.underline}2

On the other hand, however, [the Lacanian take allows us to
account]{.underline} also [for]{.underline} the [politics that is
**imminent** in the **failure** of]{.underline} these
**[anxiety-managing attempts]{.underline}**. As we have argued, [all
narratives built around]{.underline} particular objects of [**fear**,
including **geopolitical ones**, are]{.underline} eventually [failing,
as these **objects** are]{.underline} ultimately [**'false targets'**.
They are]{.underline} merely [temporary **discursive vessels**
functioning as **placeholders** for]{.underline} expressing deeper
[**ontological anxiety**, which]{.underline} is bound to **[strike
back]{.underline}**. Consequently, [attempts to make
societies]{.underline} ([feel]{.underline}) more [secure]{.underline},
habitually [end up making them]{.underline} (feel) equally, or even
more, [**insecure** and **anxious**, regardless of]{.underline} how much
[effort]{.underline} is [invested in]{.underline}to [fighting **this**
or **that**]{.underline} particular **[threat]{.underline}**. As
Heath-Kelly (2015, 2018) and Jacobsen (2020) have shown, [successful
**security discourses**]{.underline} like counter-terrorism or
cybersecurity have actually [managed to **internalise** this '**failure
to secure'**]{.underline} (Heath-Kelly, 2015) by incorporating it into
their very structure. According to them, [**counter-terrorism** and
**cybersecurity** are constructed as dangers so **slippery** and
**multifaceted** that once we resolve **one problem**]{.underline} (by
killing Osama bin Laden, resolving a particular cyberthreat),
[a]{.underline} whole [new **range** of]{.underline} terrorist groups or
cyber [issues **emerges**]{.underline} to occupy their place.

Consequently, and in contrast to conventional ontological security
literature, [**politics** of **anxiety**]{.underline} is not only about
managing and repressing it through narratives, routines and
relationships. It [is]{.underline} also [about]{.underline} other ways
of [manipulating anxiety for **political purposes**, including
**reproducing**]{.underline}, nurturing [and **spreading** it via the
**construction** of **threats** so opaque and **widespread** that they
cannot **be possibly resolved**, like **terrorism**, **cybersecurity**
-- or **hybrid warfare**. By its **repeated failure** to **secure**,
such discourses hold societies in the]{.underline} anxious ['state of
**constant** and **heightened alertness'**]{.underline} (Davies, 2019,
p. xii), [making them ready to accept]{.underline} a range of
pre-[**emptive security measures** across **all**]{.underline} possible
**[areas]{.underline}** of social life.

The defence narrative: protecting the state

[The first **narrative** pictures **HW** as a **problem** for **national
defence**]{.underline}. In this reading, which is closer to the original
formulations of HW in US military thought (Bahenský, 2018; Fridman,
2018; Hoffman, 2007), '[hybrid']{.underline} [is]{.underline} above all
[a form of **war**, or]{.underline} at least [a]{.underline}n
accompanying [feature of]{.underline} conventional [**military
confrontation**. This leads to a narrative]{.underline} embedded
[in]{.underline} strategic studies and [**IR realism**, where the threat
comes from **power politics** backed up by **military
force**]{.underline} and concerns, primarily, the state and its
institutions. As such, [the threat is]{.underline} to be [minimised by
**building up** and updating]{.underline} national and **[alliance
institutions]{.underline}** and defence capabilities. The key sources
developing this narrative in the archive are the Security Strategy, the
Defence Strategy and publications and interviews of Karel Řehka, a
former Special Forces general and perhaps the most publicly visible
military intellectual in Czechia

[This]{.underline} narrative [portrays HW a]{.underline}s
[a]{.underline}nother [**type** of **war**. It is animated by
the]{.underline} broader [Clausewitzian discourse about **war** as a
phenomenon with **unchanging 'nature'**, but]{.underline} constantly
[shifting '**character'**, where the latter]{.underline} is
[depend]{.underline}ent [upon]{.underline} the social and technological
developments of [a given age]{.underline} (Von Clausewitz, 1989). In
Řehka's words,

wars have always been and always will be a part of human society. And as
long as people have different interests and there are conflicts between
them and there comes a situation, when they are ready to use violence,
we have a war. (Řehka in Golis, 2018b)

What is different, though, is the social and technological environment,
and especially the rise of the information domain as one of the
battlefields (Řehka, 2017: 54).

[The realist]{.underline} and military [logic is **apparent** in the
**portrayal** of the **threat**, which is]{.underline} understood as [a
combination of **military**]{.underline} [and **non-military means** at
the service of **great-power politics**. With a]{.underline}n implicit
yet [clear allusion to Russia,]{.underline} Czech [Security
Strategy]{.underline} in this context [talks about 'states'
that]{.underline}

[are ready to **pursue**]{.underline} their
**[power]{.underline}**-seeking goals [through **hybrid
warfare**]{.underline} methods [combining **conventional** and
**non-conventional military means** with **non-military tools**
(propaganda]{.underline} using traditional and new media[,
disinformation]{.underline} intelligence operations[, **cyber-attacks**,
political and economic pressures, and deployment of unmarked military
personnel]{.underline}). (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech
Republic, 2015: 13)

Therefore, [the Kremlin and]{.underline} its [HW]{.underline} approaches
[are a threat first and foremost because of Russia's **military power**
that backs up its **assertive policies**]{.underline} in eastern Europe
(Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic, 2017: 7). This does not mean
that Czech security intellectuals are worried by a direct prospect of
Russian tanks in Prague. However, [official documents present **national
security** as 'indivisible' from]{.underline} that of other
**[NATO]{.underline}** and EU members (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
the Czech Republic, 2015: 6). In this logic, Russia's military threat to
the Balts, Norwegians or Romanians is seen as a security issue also in
Prague.

Of course, this does not concern only Russia's conventional military
operations, as ['\[t\]hreats to]{.underline} the security of [**allies**
may]{.underline} be of the classical military nature or they may [take
the **vague form** of **hybrid warfare'**]{.underline} (Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, 2015: 10). While these 'vague',
'hybrid' measures can take a range of forms, [most attention has been
given to their **informational dimension**, or]{.underline} the
'[threats associated with **information war**]{.underline}fare [and
**organised cyber-attacks'**]{.underline} (Ministry of Defence of the
Czech Republic, 2017: 7). Relying on US and NATO conceptual documents,
Řehka treats information warfare as a subset of HW, defined as 'the
conduct of war in the information environment' (Řehka, 2017: 23, 62).
While the means may be different, [information war is]{.underline}
clearly [part and parcel of warfare. 'Information war is]{.underline}
always [complemented by **armed action**,]{.underline} or [backed up by
**armed force'**]{.underline} (Řehka in Golis, 2018b). [This link to
**military force** is]{.underline} arguably [what
distinguishes]{.underline} the comparatively [less threatening
'**information operations**']{.underline} that are the norm also [in
peacetime from]{.underline} the much more dangerous **[information
war]{.underline}**: 'You can operate in an information and hybrid way as
much as you like. You can try to polarize society and influence
political decision making, but you must always be backed up by real
military force' (Řehka in Golis, 2018b). Therefore, [the **primary
danger** of information operations lies in the possibility]{.underline}
that [they may]{.underline} one day [turn into a **'real'
war**]{.underline} (Řehka, 2017: 178).

In this military- and state-centred logic of the defence narrative, [the
**threatened value** concerns]{.underline}, above all, the continuing
[ability of the **state**]{.underline}-- with emphasis on defence and
security institutions -- [to]{.underline} properly perform its role and
[be prepared for **effective defence**]{.underline}. The official
documents define this in the familiar terms of defending 'sovereignty
and territorial integrity' (Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic,
2017: 7; Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, 2015: 6).
Due to the above-mentioned principle of 'indivisibility' and Czechia's
emphasis on 'collective defence' (Ministry of Defence of the Czech
Republic, 2017; Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic,
2015), [the **threatened value** is extended]{.underline} also [to the
**functionality** of **international institutions**]{.underline}, of
which Czechia is part, [especially **NATO** and **EU**]{.underline}.
Řehka's work then outlines in detail how the functioning of
[institutions can be threatened by **'hybrid' operations**]{.underline},
specifically by 'manipulating information, information systems and
\[the\] decision-making process' in the case of information warfare,
further listing a range of examples including 'psychological operations,
physical destruction, electronic combat, attacks against computer
networks' (Řehka, 2017: 140). All of these are aimed at disrupting key
institutions and disarming the state, [making it **vulnerable** to
a]{.underline} possible **[conventional attack]{.underline}**.

Consequently, [the response is centred around]{.underline} reinforcing
[**security** and **defence**]{.underline} institutions. '[The only
thing that can]{.underline} effectively [prevent]{.underline} the use of
[force]{.underline} by the Russian Federation, [is **resilience** and
**preparedness** of]{.underline} potential [adversaries to face it,
**together** with choosing the **appropriate strategy'**]{.underline}
(Řehka, 2017: 182). Therefore, [the **desirable answer**]{.underline} of
the state [is 'to strengthen]{.underline} its **[defence
capacity]{.underline}** and readiness, [and to take]{.underline} its
share of the [responsibility in supporting]{.underline} those
[allies]{.underline} and partners [who bear]{.underline} the greater
share of [the burden']{.underline} (Ministry of Defence of the Czech
Republic, 2017: 7). [At home]{.underline}, this means, above all, more
money for the army, as the 'response to the deteriorating security
environment' lies in that 'the Czech government has begun to increase
defence funding' (Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic, 2017: 7;
Sobotka in Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, 2015: 3).
In the longer view, [it]{.underline} also [means]{.underline} a complex
[**adaptation** of]{.underline} the whole [**defence system** to
the]{.underline} new [**realities** of **warfare**]{.underline}
(Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic, 2016; Řehka, 2017).
Abroad, the danger can be 'eliminated' through 'the Czech Republic's
membership of NATO and the EU and its good relations with neighbouring
countries' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, 2015:
10). [Within **NATO**, this]{.underline} primarily [means]{.underline}
conventional [**defence** and **deterrence**]{.underline} measures
(Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic, 2017: 7).

As far as the broader knowledge and expertise behind [the defence
narrative]{.underline} is concerned, the threat and responses to it [are
**constructed** and **legitimised** by military expertise
and]{.underline} the authority of [the **state apparatus**]{.underline}.
While the official documents rarely elaborate on the sources of their
claims in detail, even though they also occasionally mention NATO
strategies, it is Řehka in particular who grounds his views on HW in
reference to US and NATO official doctrines, manuals and think tank
documents, as well as military classics such as Sun-Tzu, Clausewitz or
Lidell Hart (Řehka in Golis, 2018b; Řehka, 2017: 32--45). Thus, Řehka
analyses Russian behaviour through references to the supposedly timeless
rules of geopolitics, anxiety about defensibility of Russian borders
(Řehka in Golis, 2018b) and through Russia's apparent concerns about its
position in international order (Řehka, 2017: 177--178). He also
frequently invokes past and present military conflicts to provide
illustrations. In his assessment of the shift in Russian strategy
following Crimea, Řehka argues with a historical lineage, suggesting
that 'we heard the statements, we had the signals, we saw changes in the
Russian strategic documents, we saw cyber-attacks on Estonia, taking
control of South Ossetia. Everyone ignored that and then we were shocked
by the occupation of Crimea' (Řehka in Golis, 2018b). Lastly, the
narrative proves the legitimacy of its reading of the threat by
references to other official strategic and governmental documents. In
this respect, Řehka provides lengthy quotes from governmental documents
and reports of intelligence services (Řehka, 2017: 178--182).

[HW is]{.underline} thus [made known through a]{.underline} broad [body
of **academic** and]{.underline} applied [**military knowledge**,
governmental statements and reports represented]{.underline} and created
[by those in]{.underline}side (or close to) the [**national** and
**international security apparatuses**.]{.underline} With its official,
diplomatic and somewhat detached tone, [the narrative paints
a]{.underline} broad [picture of the inte**rnational situation**,
strategies of different **states** and **alliances** and
**threats**]{.underline} the Czech Republic is facing [in relation to
**HW**. On the other hand, it leaves]{.underline} many
[parts]{.underline} of the threat [veiled and reserved only for those
'**in the know**']{.underline}, who are responsible for matters of
national security. [Just as]{.underline} the specifics of [the threat
are hidden]{.underline} from the public eye, [so are many of the
**responses**, which are]{.underline} mostly [entrusted to]{.underline}
dedicated [intelligence services]{.underline}, armed forces and the
alphabet soup of specialised agencies.

### Link\-\--Hybrid War\-\--Raitasalo

#### "Hybrid Warfare" is a [prime example]{.underline} of [securitization]{.underline}\-\--it [resecuritizes]{.underline} great power relationships and [excuses]{.underline} the shaky foundations of IR.

(strategic planning) and was head lecturer of strategy at the Finnish
National Defence University, 2017, "Getting a Grip on the So-Called

[The outlook on]{.underline} international [security]{.underline} within
the Western security community, and particularly in Europe, has
[changed]{.underline} dramatically [during the **post-Cold War
era**]{.underline}.1 At the same time, [the West has gone
**out-ofarea**, developed an **expeditionary military mind-set** and
fought **several wars**]{.underline} of choice against third-rate
military adversaries [in the name of]{.underline} "military crisis
management," "counterinsurgency warfare," and [the "**War on
Terror**."]{.underline}

During the past 25 years, the shared [Western understandings
on]{.underline} international [security]{.underline} have gone through a
process of foundational change. Western notions of international
security and military affairs [have gone through a **paradigm
change**]{.underline}. At the core of this change has been the belief
that [we have been able to overcome]{.underline} the [Cold
War]{.underline} era [**zero-sum logic** to]{.underline} international
[**security** and **adversarial relations** with]{.underline} other
[great powers]{.underline} of the day[---]{.underline}namely [**Russia**
and **China**]{.underline}. The West has moved away or gradually grown
out from containing and deterring state-based military threats towards
ever broadening notions of international security. [The
"new"]{.underline} post-Cold War-era Western [security perspective
included]{.underline} the stability of the globalizing international
system and **[human security]{.underline}** as perspectives through
which [to analyse]{.underline} security [**threats** and]{.underline}
appropriate **[responses]{.underline}** to these threats.2

[Now that Russia]{.underline} has [used]{.underline} very traditional
[**great-power tools** in **Ukraine**]{.underline} since 2013[,
and]{.underline} also in **[Syria]{.underline}** since 2015, many
[Western states]{.underline} have [found themselves in need of a **"new"
framework**]{.underline}---any framework---[to cope with this **return**
of the **past**]{.underline} in contemporary international politics.
After all, most European states could not conceptualize military threats
in Europe only three years ago. Similarly, the United States has pulled
out its troops from Europe with the conviction that state-based military
threats in Europe are unimaginable. Thus, during the last 25 years, most
Western states have focused on committing military troops to
multinational expeditionary operations with scant direct connections to
Western states' survival or national security interests. After Crimea,
[advocating **hybrid warfare** has been a way to **(re)securitize**
the]{.underline} traditional **[great-power perspective]{.underline}**
on international security[---an approach]{.underline} that [Western
states]{.underline} had [desecuritized since the end of the **Cold
War**]{.underline} as the West was redefining international security on
its own terms.3

[The **hybrid warfare thesis** is represented by the idea]{.underline}
that [Russia]{.underline} has [invented a **new approach** to
**statecraft** and **military affairs** after the war in **Georgia**. It
reflects]{.underline} more than anything the [collective **Western
surprise** that]{.underline} the very traditional actions of
[Russia]{.underline} have [caused]{.underline}. This article argues that
[the **hybrid warfare thesis**]{.underline} has [catered to
the]{.underline} Western [need to explain]{.underline} and understand
[Russia's actions]{.underline} in Ukraine [as]{.underline} the post-Cold
War-era [Western conceptualisations of international
security]{.underline} have [prove]{.underline}d [to be laid on **shaky
foundations**]{.underline}. Great-power rivalries, spheres-of-influence
thinking, propaganda, coercion, the use of proxies, spying, and the use
of military force by great powers did not become extinct with the demise
of the Cold War even though many Western analysts and statesmen thought
they had. Recent actions of Russia have revealed this flaw in the
Western approach to post-Cold War-era international security.

The emergence and development of the hybrid warfare thesis has been
politically useful---highlighting the changing nature and shortcomings
of the postCold War-era Western perspective on international security.
[The analytical **utility** of the **hybrid warfare thesis**
is]{.underline} more [limited. Many]{.underline} of the supposedly new
[elements of]{.underline} the so**[-called hybrid warfare]{.underline}**
and the myriad of associated and supposedly new forms of warfare
[are]{.underline} in fact [**normal practices** of statecraft rather
than **novel expressions** of **war**.]{.underline} Many Western
strategic analysts and statesmen have problems in dealing with these
traditional tools of statecraft due to the development of Western
perspective on international security during the post-Cold War era. More
than anything, the rise of [the **hybrid warfare thesis** is a
collective]{.underline} Western [attempt to **domesticate**
the]{.underline} traditional [threat]{.underline} that [Russia
poses]{.underline} today.

Below, [I]{.underline} set out to [show how]{.underline} the [**hybrid
war discourse** epitomises]{.underline} the contemporary [ontological
insecurities of]{.underline} the EU and [**NATO**. Attempts
to]{.underline} frame bold institutional [responses to]{.underline} the
["hybrid" threats,]{.underline} notably [via]{.underline} the [promotion
of resilience]{.underline} as the institutional equivalent of a sense of
OS, [mark "bringing the **war** back in" for]{.underline} the
international [security management]{.underline} profiles
[of]{.underline} these two [major Western organisations. NATO and the
EU's]{.underline} emerging **[discourse]{.underline}** and practice [in
countering **hybrid warfare** seek to prove their **continuing
relevance** in the contemporary era]{.underline}. The [**preoccupation**
with **hybrid threats**]{.underline} has [made]{.underline} the concept
of [war]{.underline} empirically [more **available**]{.underline} for
the EU. Albeit war continues to be normatively unacceptable, public
discussion of concrete practices to counter various "hybrid" moves from
third parties as part of the broader "hybrid warfare" countering
paradigm is far from a taboo for the EU in this day and age.4
[NATO]{.underline} as a more traditional security organisation [is
wrestling harder with the **threshold of war** becoming]{.underline}
increasingly [fluid in the context of **"hybrid"
engagements**]{.underline}. Lawyers debate whether "hybrid warfare"
calls for updates in the law of armed conflict. Ultimately, [it is the
legal characterisation which determines whether a situation]{.underline}
is considered to [amount to **armed conflict**, and]{.underline}
accordingly, [whether peacetime law or law of war applies]{.underline}
(O'Connell 2015). The hybridisation of warfare further challenges the
(substantively anyway dubious) legal distinction between international
and non-international armed conflicts (Reeves 2016). Meanwhile,
[the]{.underline} general [**acceptance** of the **term "hybrid
war(fare)"**]{.underline} also [signals the **politicisation** of
the]{.underline} established [**legal definition** of
**war**]{.underline} as a particular practice that takes place when
certain specific conditions have been fulfilled[.]{.underline}

Brandishing "war" on political contestations of varying intensity has
furthermore ethical implications (cf. Franke 2015). As the EU and NATO
are grappling with honing their response to the menaces and tactics
combining a mixture of special forces, backdoor proxies, information
campaigns, and "digital warfare" (e.g. Ilves 2016), having further added
the non-state variant of the "hybrid threat" to the mix (such as Daesh),
a broader question transpires about the repercussions of the alleged
hybridisation of warfare and its perpetrators for the study of security
in IR.

The article proceeds in four sections. The first section gauges various
definitions of hybrid warfare, outlines their relation to the notion of
ontological insecurity, and the consequent countering attempts of hybrid
threats to the mirror-image process of OS-seeking. I make a threefold
proposition: [hybrid warfare is disturbing **ontologically**, because it
embodies the entanglement of **politics** and **war**]{.underline} in
the contemporary era[; **epistemologically**, because it unhinges the
**war**/**peace binary**]{.underline} implicitly
[underpinning]{.underline} the [IR]{.underline} discipline (Barkawi
2016);5 [and]{.underline} last but not least [**ethically**, because
the]{.underline} inherent [danger of becoming a **monster** in the
course of fighting **monsters**]{.underline} (aka the efficient
countering of hybrid warfare) [is]{.underline} particularly [poignant
for **democratic polities**]{.underline} (cf. Nietzsche 2003, Aphorism
146). The second section applies various OS-attuned lenses on the
institutional responses of the EU and NATO to hybrid warfare, and the
third section empirically illustrates the argument. The article
concludes with a call for caution: [adopting the "**everything** is
**dangerous**"- approach]{.underline} further [blurs the **fuzzy line**
between **politics** and **war**, adding heat to]{.underline} the calls
to [revisit the international **laws** on **armed
conflicts**]{.underline} (cf. Winter 2011). The justifiability of
illiberal methods in safeguarding liberal values constitutes the crux of
the OS dilemma for the Western security community battling the "hybrid
menace".

Hybrid warfare as the epitome of ontological insecurity

Much of the strategic studies literature has been animated by the
problem of uncertainty in international relations and, by extension, the
consequences of uncertainty for the management of states' security
dilemma (Rathbun 2007, cf. Mitzen and Schweller 2011). [**Ambiguity**
is]{.underline} likewise [the **original sin**]{.underline} the "[hybrid
warfare]{.underline}"-notion [draws on. Yet]{.underline}, the concept
"**[hybrid warfare]{.underline}**" [is **itself faulty** of definitional
ambiguities]{.underline}. Although an increasingly utilised concept in
the contemporary strategic and policy discourse, ["hybrid
warfare"]{.underline} refers to a number of distinct phenomena, and
consequently means different things to different people. It [lacks a
clear and **uniform definition**]{.underline}, hence embodying and
[perpetuating the **countenance** it seeks to capture. "Hybrid warfare"
is]{.underline} thus [victim to its]{.underline} own **[conceptual
plasticity]{.underline}** (Tenenbaum 2015, p. 43).

The heterogeneous origins, composition, and use of the concept can be
somewhat clarified by distinguishing between (i) hybrid threats (as
complex and multidimensional modern menaces, crisscrossing multiple
issue areas and amplifying one another); (ii) hybrid warfare (as a
particular mode of waging war, combining conventional and
unconventional, coercive and non-coercive means, capabilities, tactics
and formations in a centrally organised and orchestrated manner), and
(iii) hybrid war (as "a form of violent conflict that simultaneously
involves state and non-state actors, with the use of conventional and
unconventional means of warfare that are not limited to the battlefield
or a particular physical territory" (Jacobs and Lasconjarias 2015, p. 3,
cf. Jonsson and Seely 2015, Browning 2002, p. 2). Tenenbaum (2015)
offers a useful genealogy of the "hybrid warfare" concept, highlighting
the notion's distinct effects at the political and strategic,
operational, tactical and capability levels. Yet, the practical use of
the term "hybrid" has interchangeably and rather confusingly moved
between these different levels of analysis, seeking to capture the
interconnected nature of modern vulnerabilities, the multiplicity of
stakeholders in the contemporary security game (i.e. state and non-state
actors, regular and irregular forces), along with the diversity and
simultaneity of conventional and unconventional means used, ranging from
military, political, economic, diplomatic, technological to criminal
modes of engagement (Hoffman 2007, Glenn 2009, Pawlak 2015). Writings on
hybrid warfare thus tap into both the literature on
asymmetric/counterinsurgency warfare (McCuen 2008, cf. Winter 2011) and
that on interstate wars (Gerasimov 2013). No wonder that "hybrid" has
come to accommodate as varied phenomena as Russia's takeover of Crimea
in 2014 and its involvement in the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine,
Russia's meddling in the elections of various countries around the world
via sophisticated phishing, doxing, and fake news campaigns, and the
regional and global operating logics of politically ambitious non-state
organisations, such as Hezbollah, Boko Haram, Al-Qaeda, or Daesh, or
even criminal structures (e.g. the drug cartels in Mexico; see further
Tenenbaum 2015).

Drawing on the emerging scholarship on hybrid warfare, three core
interconnections can be flagged between hybrid warfare (as an empirical
phenomenon and a discursive trope) and (the study of) OS in IR. First,
along the ontological dimension, "[hybrid warfare]{.underline}"
[captures the]{.underline} increasing [**porousness** of lines between
**politics** and **war**]{.underline} in the contemporary era, thus
[defying]{.underline} the [attempts of **organising life** and social
relations in a **particular way**]{.underline} (cf. Huysmans 1998).
While many critics of the notion maintain that hybrid warfare remains
just another variation on the old Clausewitzian understanding of war as
the continuation of politics with a mixture of other means (cf. Gray
2007), others nonetheless highlight the particularity of the
contemporary hybrid engagements. For the scholars finding distinct added
value in the notion, the calibration and central coordination of the
convergence of the various regular and irregular elements, further
amplified by the new technological vulnerabilities and capabilities in
contemporary hybrid engagements, have made the creeping indeterminacy
about what war exactly is and how to go about it in the present day only
more intense. The envisioning of hybrid engagements as a pre-phase of a
full-scale military attack further adds to the ambiguity between th
boundaries of warfare as essentially organised, reciprocal fighting and
politics as a peaceful space of ordinary goings-about.

For those at the receiving end, [hybrid warfare emerges as an
**epitome** of **ontological insecurity**, referring to the "deep,
incapacitating state of not knowing which dangers to confront
and]{.underline} which to [ignore]{.underline}, i.e. how to get by in
the world" (Mitzen 2006, p. 345). [It is a]{.underline}n urgent
[reminder of the chameleon-like character of war --]{.underline} that
is, [war's tendency to]{.underline} [constantly change]{.underline} its
[forms]{.underline} as well as its appearances (Clausewitz 1976, p. 80).
At the most fundamental level, then, [hybrid warfare epitomises the
**blurry line** between **politics** and **war**. It]{.underline} also
[symbolises the struggle for]{.underline}, and fear over losing,
[control "over]{.underline} the ends, ways and means of [nations,
communities and societies]{.underline}" (Ruiz Palmer 2015, p. 61).
Assuming that collectivities' agency is predicated on identification and
routinisation (Greve 2017, p. 7), [uncertainty about]{.underline} the
nature of [external threats does]{.underline} not just generate physical
insecurity but also [evokes **ontological insecurity** for]{.underline}
the [institutions]{.underline} (such as military) and organisations in
question. [Hybrid warfare exposes collective actors to]{.underline} the
fundamental [existential questions]{.underline} about the continuity of
their external environment as they know it and their own finitude,
[with]{.underline} the [related anxiety about]{.underline} the
difficulties of [concretising]{.underline} unknown and [indeterminate
threats]{.underline} (cf. Ejdus 2017). Thus formulated, [hybrid
warfare]{.underline} directly targets actors' "security of being"
(Kinnvall 2004, p. 746), [disturb]{.underline}ing [the stability
of]{.underline} their [**sense-making** attempts of the **surrounding
world** and]{.underline} the [events they are faced with,]{.underline}
and [threatening to unsettle]{.underline} the established
[institutionalised routines]{.underline}. Instead, [hybrid
warfare]{.underline} itself [emerges as an "**institutionalization of
doubt**", provoking]{.underline} considerable **[ontological
insecurity]{.underline}** (cf. Giddens 1990, pp. 92--94).

[**Epistemologically**,]{.underline} and on a second note, ["hybrid
warfare"]{.underline} thus significantly [unsettles the "**war**/**peace
binary**" which]{.underline} has arguably [structured]{.underline} the
[thinking about]{.underline}, and categorisation of, [war]{.underline}
in the Eurocentric tradition of its study. This particular understanding
of war(time), cleanly juxtaposed to peace(time) has been attuned to the
needs of an international system of sovereign nation-states, enabling
the consequent categorisation of war into international (inter-state)
and civil (intra-state) war (Barkawi 2016). "Hybrid wars" emphatically
challenge a neat war/peace binary, which has, however, served as a core
source of OS for the discipline of IR. There is a family resemblance
between the concepts of "hybrid warfare" and the notion of "unpeace"
introduced by Kello (2017), seeking to capture the ambiguous, yet
persistent irritants by virtual weapons on the international order.

[**Finally**, hybrid warfare meets **OS** at the]{.underline}
intersection of **[ethical security studies]{.underline}** (Browning
2016, Browning and McDonald 2013). Just as OS-seeking practices need to
be analysed with an eye on the ethical conundrums and dilemmas they
might give rise to due to the exercise of power along the way (e.g.
Mälksoo 2015, Rossdale 2015), the "social turn" accompanying the
hybridisation of warfare in various empirical settings, and the
consequent countering attempts of hybrid warfare, require equally intent
ethical attention (see Owens 2012). If hybrid conflicts are understood
as full spectrum wars ... combining a struggle against an armed enemy
and a wider struggle for, control and support of the combat zone's
indigenous population, the support of the home fronts of the intervening
nations, and the support of the international community (McCuen 2008, p.
108), [hybrid warfare]{.underline} really [appears as]{.underline} yet
[another variation on the **theme** of "**war** amongst the **people**".
The intermingling of **political** and **military
activities**]{.underline} thus not only underscores the need for their
parallel examination (Smith 2005), but also [calls for **caution** in
the **lax use** of **war** as a **metaphor**]{.underline} for
engagements of various types and intensity. [If society must be
**defended**]{.underline} (Foucault 2003) [against]{.underline} nearly
[**everything**, at **all times**, and if everyone becomes **connected**
and]{.underline} potentially [**targeted** in the global **"hybrid war"
zone**, what is left of **politics**, and the]{.underline} delicate
[balancing act between **security** and **democratic
liberties**?]{.underline} The implications of constant public perception
management in the service of protecting the freedom of speech in the
"post-truth" world are perhaps not fully fathomable yet. The
disconcerting potential of the increasingly prominent strategic
communication discourse in the EU6 and NATO7 for the everyday of
democratic politics is already evident (cf. Garton Ash 2016). [Securing
a]{.underline} core **[democratic value]{.underline}** -- freedom of
speech/freedom of media -- [via]{.underline} an **[obsessive
emphasis]{.underline}** on proactive and [purposeful communication
management points at the]{.underline} classic [paradox of militant
democracy]{.underline} whereby [the]{.underline} very [attempt to
**defend** democracy might inadvertently damage it]{.underline} (cf.
Müller 2016, p. 253).

Managing hybrid warfare as ontological security-seeking

[Hybrid warfare emerges as the **embodiment** of **uncertainty**
for]{.underline} the EU and [**NATO**. The meanings of **uncertainty**
range from **fear**, **ignorance**, **confusion**, and]{.underline}/or
[**indeterminacy** in **IR theory**]{.underline} (Rathbun 2007, pp.
533--534). It is certainly possible to apply all these lenses and
consequent emphases on reading the EU and NATO responses to the
fundamentally undetermined condition of hybrid warfare, ambivalence par
excellence. Paraphrasing Huysmans's (1998) original application of the
OS concept in IR, [the Western countering attempts of **hybrid warfare**
tell a **security story** wherein a fear of **uncertainty**, or of the
**unknown** trumps a]{.underline} more concrete **[fear of
death]{.underline}** at the hands of other people. [As hybrid
warfare]{.underline} vividly [symbolises "an epistemological fear -- a
fear of not knowing"]{.underline} (Huysmans 1998, p. 235) (e.g. when war
is waged at "us"; what is this "new" kind of "war" really all about
etc.), [the]{.underline} emerging strategic [responses of]{.underline}
these two core [Western organisations demonstrate how the]{.underline}
double [fear of death and not knowing]{.underline} quite when and in
which ways to expect it, [gets objectified]{.underline} in order [to
make the]{.underline} growing [list of]{.underline} potentially
[existentially dangerous subjects and phenomena more
**concrete**]{.underline}, palpable and conceivable for oneself. [Hybrid
warfare]{.underline} thus [emerges as the "**unbearable
void**"]{.underline} (Huysmans 1998, p. 237), [which needs to be
**objectified**]{.underline}, in order [to become "**knowable**"
and]{.underline} (more) **[tolerable]{.underline}**.

Huysmans (1998) defines OS as a strategy for managing the limits of
reflexivity by fixing social relations into a symbolic and institutional
order. In his interpretation, OS thus concerns the general question of
the political, or "how to order social relations while simultaneously
guaranteeing the very activity of ordering itself" (Huysmans 1998, p.
242). [Hybrid warfare]{.underline}, by definition, [destabilises
the]{.underline} traditional [cognitive]{.underline} security
[environment of]{.underline} states and [international organisations,
and]{.underline} consequently, [renders their **identity** insecure.
Crafting]{.underline} the institutional [responses to hybrid
warfare]{.underline} thus [becomes a "**dread management**" exercise
wherein]{.underline} daily [**security administration** attempts,
seeking to **objectify** the]{.underline} abstract [**fear of death**
through constructing **concrete enemies** and]{.underline} thus
[introducing]{.underline} a level of **[certainty]{.underline}**,
nonetheless [remain **toothless** at the inability to "**hierarchize
threats**" in an atmosphere of]{.underline} potentially
[permanent]{.underline} state of [**crisis** and
**urgency**]{.underline} (Huysmans 1998, p. 243). The pursuits of daily
security and OS ("security of being") thus collapse into each other.

Hybrid warfare indicates a multitude of possible contingencies,
generating anxiety about one's ability to remain oneself and to continue
to act. It is thus linked to "anxiety over the vulnerability of
\[Western\] power" (Bell 2012, pp. 230--231), threatening the West about
losing its particularistic form of existence (cf. Creppell 2011, p.
455). Anxiety, in contrast to fear, which per Giddens (1991, p. 43)
constitutes a response to a specific threat, concerns "perceived threats
to the integrity of the security system of the individual" (Giddens
1991, pp. 44--45, cf. Browning and Joenniemi 2017, p. 38; Rumelili
2015). OS-seeking aims to mitigate the effects of such hard uncertainty,
bringing it within bearable limits (Mitzen 2006, p. 346). Routines are
instrumental here, as they "pacify the cognitive environment ...
'inoculating' individuals against paralytic, deep fear of chaos" (Mitzen
2006, p. 347).

[Being able to survive]{.underline} the "[hybrid threats]{.underline}"
[is]{.underline} directly [pertinent to the **survival** of]{.underline}
the EU and [NATO as]{.underline} particular kinds of [organisations,
underpinned]{.underline} and driven [by **specific values** -- which
cannot be **sacrificed** or **diluted** in the struggle for **physical**
and **institutional survival**. Yet, hybrid warfare disturbs the **OS**
of]{.underline} the EU and [**NATO** in]{.underline} subtly [distinct
ways]{.underline}. Due to the particularities of their institutional
set-ups and historical foundations, the OS drives of the two
organisations are somewhat distinctive. [NATO's history is]{.underline}
occasionally [told through its **surpassing** of]{.underline} a sequence
of [crises, albeit the end of the **Cold War** and]{.underline} the
collapse of its original enemy [created a situation of]{.underline}
unprecedented [**uncertainty** and **ontological insecurity** for the
Alliance]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the EU's ontological insecurity is a
more recent phenomenon, stemming mostly from the Eurocrisis and the
looming possibility of a Grexit a few years ago; the refugee/migration
crisis in Europe of 2015 (Dingott Alkhoper 2018; Mitzen 2018); the
actual UK decision on Brexit in 2016 (Browning 2018); and the rise of
populist politics within the EU (Kinnvall, Manners, Mitzen 2018) and the
United States. [NATO]{.underline} as a military alliance [has
been]{.underline} historically more [accustomed to]{.underline} the
**[othering]{.underline}** practices [of]{.underline} concrete
geographical [places]{.underline}, whereas the EU is generally regarded
as an organisation that has risen above geopolitical othering,
juxtaposing itself to Europe's dark past instead (Rumelili 2018, Subotic
2018, and Della Sala 2018). Accordingly, the EU might be more at home
with hybrid threat management due to its historically broader
conceptualisation of security through the paradigm of intertwined risks
rather than being focused more strictly on "the threat, use and control
of military force" in the manner of a traditional defence alliance (Walt
1991, p. 212; Manners 2002). Regardless of its perpetual transformer's
self-image, [hybrid threats represent the uncomfortable
"**hard**"]{.underline} or "fundamental" [**uncertainty** for
NATO]{.underline} (cf. Mitzen 2006, p. 346) [and are]{.underline} thus
[ontologically **disturbing** for the security of its **self** as a
**traditional alliance** with a **collective security pledge** bound to
"**armed attack**"]{.underline} against [one or more of its **member
states**]{.underline}.

In order to achieve OS, actors strive for "routinizing their relations
with significant others" (Mitzen 2006, p. 342). Routines help to keep
ontological fears at bay, out of everyday discursive consciousness
(Mitzen 2006, p. 348). From this perspective, [NATO's **naming** and
**shaming strategy** vis-à-vis Russia as part of its hybrid warfare
countering strategy links the **uncertainty** emanating from the
**hybrid**]{.underline} nature of the new [**threats** to
the]{.underline} known and [**routine relationship** with
its]{.underline} traditional **[antagonist]{.underline}**.8 The
incapacitating difficulties related to planning ahead in anticipating
and countering hybrid engagements are thus somewhat alleviated by the
latter's attachment to a known rival. Russia's hybrid intervention in
Ukraine has concurrently provided NATO with the familiar parameters of
the cognitive "cocoon" (Giddens 1991, pp. 39--40) which enables the
alliance to reproduce its cognitively "knowable" world. A Mitzenian
reading of NATO's emerging response to hybrid threats/warfare thus
points at the renewed routinisation of the "programmed cognitive and
behavioral responses" to Russia as the alliance's original nemesis.

[Restoring]{.underline} traditional [**vigilance** vis-à-vis
**Russia**]{.underline}, buttressing the forward defence along the
Alliance's eastern flank with the respective military reinforcements,
contingency planning and exercises[, the]{.underline} emerging [response
of **NATO** to the **hybrid menace** could]{.underline} also [be read as
a]{.underline}n attempted [restoration of a]{.underline} known
[**normative order** for the **North Atlantic Alliance**. Hybrid warfare
endangers the]{.underline} basic [features of the]{.underline} said
[normative order]{.underline} (or that of the broadly conceived Western
security community in general, including the EU as well) [as
its]{.underline} efficient [countering would]{.underline} likely
[compromise the]{.underline} underlying [principles for this
**order's**]{.underline} particularistic **[existence]{.underline}**
(cf. Creppell 2011, p. 450). As a threat of subversion, **[hybrid
warfare]{.underline}** [exposes the]{.underline} internal
[vulnerabilities in the **body** of]{.underline} the traditional
security alliance (**[NATO]{.underline}**) and a self-proclaimed
post-modern security actor (i.e. the EU; cf. Cooper 2004). [This
concerns]{.underline}, in particular, [the **ever-elusive**]{.underline}
(and contested) **[balance]{.underline}** [between
**national**]{.underline}/organisational **[security]{.underline}** [and
**individual liberties**]{.underline} (cf. Waldron 2003, Neocleous
2007), [as s**trategic communication** is]{.underline} inherently [at
odds with **free speech** as a **core value** of **Western liberalism**.
Countering **hybrid warfare** is conducive of generating a **security
predicament** of **perpetual pre-emption** which]{.underline}, by
definition, [would indicate pre-emptive gathering of **all sorts** of
**data**]{.underline}, thus likely [infringing on]{.underline} the
**[privacy]{.underline}** of the individuals [for]{.underline} the sake
of the organisational/regional/national [security. This]{.underline}
precautionary logic [resonates with the **risk society**]{.underline}
approach [which]{.underline} [characterises]{.underline} the [struggling
with a sheer **volume** of **risks** with]{.underline} potentially
[fundamental consequences as a **key feature** of
**modernity**]{.underline}, implying that "decisions are ... made not in
context of certainty, nor even of available knowledge, but of doubt,
premonition, foreboding, challenge, mistrust, fear, and anxiety" (Ewald
2002, p. 294).

[A less **sympathetic reading** of]{.underline} such an [ontological
"**dread management**"]{.underline} exercise [would regard]{.underline}
particularly [NATO's]{.underline} emerging [narrative]{.underline} and
practice [about **hybrid warfare** as]{.underline} an example of
[turning]{.underline} unknown [anxieties into]{.underline} "the
manageable [certainties of **objects** of **fear**]{.underline} to
physical security [through **securitization**]{.underline}" (Browning
and Joenniemi 2017, p. 38, Rumelili 2015, Steele 2008, p. 64). NATO's
and the EU's "dread management" strategies vis-à-vis the hybrid
"spectre" tune us further in the direction of Croft and
Vaughan-Williams's (2017, p. 27) research agenda, asking specifically
"\[w\]hose dread is managed and at what cost for whom?", thus
[illuminating]{.underline} the [ethical pitfalls related to]{.underline}
their [OSseeking. Due to]{.underline} the [omnipresence]{.underline} and
ambivalence [of **hybrid threats**, NATO]{.underline} and the EU's
[countering strategies of hybrid warfare verge on "**deep
securitization**"]{.underline}, which Abulof (2014, p. 397) defines by
its distinctly high scale and scope of securitising moves. The [hybrid
warfare discourse has become **ubiquitous** in]{.underline} the
respective repertoires of the EU and [**NATO**, with **hybrid
threats**]{.underline} [framed as **imminent**, **protracted**, and
**existentially endangering**. **Securitisation**]{.underline} thus
[emerges as a **response** to]{.underline} the [**ontological
insecurity**, with a promise of "**mitigating**]{.underline} the
[existential angst arising from **death** being]{.underline} both
**[certain]{.underline}** [and undetermined]{.underline}" (Abulof 2014,
p. 403, Huysmans 1998). Both [NATO]{.underline} and the EU [are engaged
in **collective securitisation**]{.underline} [of **hybrid
warfare**]{.underline} since the threat in question has a systemic
referent -- that is, it "imping\[es\] upon international and collective
identities, or the rules and norms governing interstate interactions"
(Sperling and Webber 2017, p. 26). [**Hybrid threat management**
by]{.underline} the EU and [**NATO** could]{.underline} accordingly [be
understood as]{.underline} the [institutionalisation of]{.underline}
their respective organisational [OS-seeking]{.underline} via strategies
of "being" (aimed at constructing a strong narrative to buttress a
continuous and esteemboosting identity) and "doing" (focused on an
attempt to uphold a stable cognitive environment through routinised
practice "whilst also undertaking action contributing to a sense of
integrity and pride") (Flockhart 2016, p. 799). While the EU is
emphatically defending core democratic values (freedom of expression,
freedom of assembly, media freedom and access to information) (European
Parliament 2016), [NATO's countering of **hybrid threats**]{.underline}
[demonstrates]{.underline} more explicitly the
[intertwining]{.underline} of its **[physical survival]{.underline}** as
an efficient political-military alliance [and a sense of
**OS**]{.underline} [as the principal warden of]{.underline} the
**[European security]{.underline}** (and more broadly Western world)
order. [The inability to honour the **collective defence pledge** would
be a blow to NATO's **identity**]{.underline} [and mean its]{.underline}
(almost certain) **[death]{.underline}**. [The security of its
"**body**"]{.underline} (i.e. physical security) [and
"**self**"]{.underline} (i.e. ontological/identity security)
[are]{.underline} therefore [less **distinguishable**]{.underline} than
in the case of the EU which is a far more complex political setting,
with only relatively recent claims (albeit with increasing
assertiveness) in the traditional security sphere.9 Regardless, for both
organisations, [countering **hybrid threats**]{.underline} [serves as a
reactive **self-legitimation**]{.underline} [as they]{.underline} thus
[reassert]{.underline} their [relevance and ability to be of
**assistance**]{.underline} for their respective [member
states]{.underline} and populations.

Hybrid warfare in daily security management

[A bird's-eye view of]{.underline} the EU and [NATO's]{.underline}
emerging [management strategies of **hybrid warfare** demonstrates how
the]{.underline} looming [hybrid agenda is]{.underline} directly
[tapping into]{.underline} the [everyday security concerns of
these]{.underline} two main [Western]{.underline} political and security
[organisations]{.underline}.

[In NATO]{.underline} and the EU's [responses to **hybrid threats**, OS
emerges as the actor's ability to **tolerate**, and
**cope**]{.underline} with change (Browning and Joenniemi 2017, p. 32).
Albeit seemingly counterintuitive due to the general human preference
for stability over change, OS might nonetheless "derive\[\] from
constructive attempts to (re)create and consolidate collective
self-identities" (Vieira 2016, p. 292). [The **leitmotif** of adapting
to]{.underline} changing [circumstances is reflected in]{.underline}
both the EU and [NATO's]{.underline} notable [emphases on
**resilience**]{.underline} -- which, I argue, could be regarded as an
institutional alias for their positive sense of self, and by consequence
a functional equivalent of these actors' OS. [Rendered as "the
**ability** of **states** and societies to **reform**]{.underline}, thus
[withstanding]{.underline} and recovering from internal and external
**[crisis]{.underline}**" (Wagner and Anholt 2016, p. 414),
"[resilience]{.underline}" [manifests a claim on]{.underline} a sense of
[institutional **self-worth** and **relevance** amidst **deep
uncertainty**. Invoking "**resilience**" appears]{.underline}
emphatically [as an **anxiety management**]{.underline} rather than
avoidance **[exercise]{.underline}**, at relatively low ontological
costs involved for the actors concerned. [Resilience]{.underline} is
thus conceptually linked, yet not synonymous with OS: it [functions as
an **imperfect solution** to the]{.underline} perennial [**ontological
insecurity** problem]{.underline} -- for OS remains always to be
measured in degrees, rather than being categorically achievable in
practice. As a notoriously flexible notion, politically convenient and
intellectually perplexing in equal doses, resilience refers to "the
process of seeking to maintain the status quo in the face of shocks, but
it also refers \[to\] the idea of transforming a referent object"
(Bourbeau and Ryan 2018, p. 223).

**[Adaptability]{.underline}**, or the ability to cope with change, [has
been the **key trope** in NATO's discursive
self-presentation]{.underline} throughout the post-Cold War era (Barany
and Rauchhaus 2011). Likewise, the EU Global Strategy on foreign and
security policy (2016) demonstrates the Union's shift in emphasising
"resilience" over more progressive foreign policy goals, as reflected in
the earlier, 2003 EU Security Strategy (Mälksoo 2016, Wagner and Anholt
2016, Juncos 2017). NATO and the EU's institutional emphasis on
resilience captures the paradoxical dynamic of the "strategy of doing"
in their OS maximisation attempts, combining a continuous struggle to
manage emergent change by routinised practices, yet also demonstrating
ability to undertake action to tackle transformative change (see
Flockhart 2016, p. 816). For what it is worth,
"[resilience]{.underline}" [functions as a **symbolic codename**
for]{.underline} the EU and [NATO's institutional responses to
the]{.underline} deeply [unsettling **ontological insecurity** condition
evoked by **hybrid threats**/**warfare**. It captures the]{.underline}
necessarily "**[hybrid]{.underline}**" **[defence]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} effectively [counter]{.underline} [the
**menace**]{.underline} in question, including such non-traditional
issues as social and political cohesion, vigilance about the funding
sources of domestic political parties, and legitimate and effective
governance in its spectrum of security (Galeotti 2015, 2016a).
[Countering hybrid threats by propping]{.underline} the EU and [NATO's
**resilience**]{.underline} in various areas ([ranging from **critical
infrastructure**, **energy** and **cyber security**]{.underline} to
transport[, **financial system** and **society** as a
whole]{.underline}) [enables]{.underline} a host of [claims]{.underline}
[on the pertinent polities' **viability**, ability to **adjust** to
the]{.underline} quickly changing demands of the **[modern
world]{.underline}**, ownership of the contemporary security scene, and
last but not least a workable partnership between the two organisations.
Understood "as a preventive and deterrent action to solidify societies
and avoid escalation of crises both within and outside the EU" (European
Commission 2017), resilience, and the calls to strengthen it, put the
main responsibility to the respective member states and their populace,
but notably also partner countries in neighbourhood regions (European
Commission and High Representative 2017). [The]{.underline} vernacular
[targets of **hybrid threats**]{.underline} thus [become]{.underline}
the main [stakeholders in]{.underline} the [OS management pursuits
of]{.underline} these [Western organisations]{.underline}, effectively
[enabling]{.underline} the EU and [NATO's evasion of responsibility
under the banner of **sought OS provision**]{.underline}.

The Emergence of the Hybrid War Thesis

[Hybrid war]{.underline} and hybrid warfare [represent the **latest
manifestation** of the]{.underline} Western [need to
(re)conceptualise]{.underline} and (re)define the post-Cold War
[international security]{.underline} logic and associated [rules
according to which states use **military force**]{.underline}--- and
other elements of statecraft---in the international system. [Hybrid
warfare can]{.underline} also [be]{.underline} conceptualised as [the
latest **Western strategic discourse**, which]{.underline} is supposed
to [explain away]{.underline} the [international security
problems]{.underline} that Western states have faced during the last
several years, and which have been [left unexplained by]{.underline} the
other Western strategic [discourses on **globalization**, **new wars**,
the **RMA**, expeditionary **military**]{.underline} (crisis management)
[**operations**, and the **GWOT**]{.underline}.

In a way, [hybrid warfare has become the latest]{.underline} Western
strategic **[buzzword]{.underline}**, which is [facilitating a deeper
understanding of]{.underline} the apparently new elements of [the
**chaotic** and **unpredictable**]{.underline} contemporary
international **[security arena]{.underline}**. From this perspective,
[hybrid warfare is assisting in explaining away]{.underline} the
[surprise]{.underline} that [Russia's]{.underline} traditional
[**great-power policies** and actions in **Ukraine** since **early
2014**]{.underline} (and in Syria since autumn 2015) have caused amongst
Western statesmen and strategic analysts.

Gen Philip Breedlove, the commander of the United States European
Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe, noted in January 2016 that
for 20 years, US military decisions were guided by the effort to make
Russia a partner. In General Breedlove's words, the West has "hugged the
bear"---that is, Russia--- for 20 years, but after Georgia (2008),
Crimea (2014), Donbass (2014-) and Syria (2015-), this has to change.30
Looking back some 20 years, the efforts to redefine rules of the
international security game on Western standards have now become
contested by Russia.

Within the Western strategic community, the hybrid warfare thesis has
been advocated to depict the new reality of contemporary warfare. The
concept itself is not a totally new one. It has matured over several
years, focusing first on the mixing of regular and irregular forces and
tactics with terrorism and revolutionary technologies to negate the
military superiority of the West in general---and the United States in
particular. It is noteworthy that this maturation of the hybrid warfare
thesis took place in an era when the West was overtly preoccupied with
asymmetric conflicts or irregular forms of warfare in Afghanistan and
Iraq. It was during these years---more than a decade---that many
believed that the "old" statebased big wars were a thing of the past and
that the future will be marked with wars similar to those that the
United States and its NATO allies witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan.31
These wars showcased the deficiency of the high-tech RMA thesis and the
ineffectiveness of the global-level militarized GWOT as a new security
approach. As Mattis and Hoffman have argued,

\[t\]he kinds of war we will face in the future cannot be won by
focusing on technology; they will be won by preparing our people for
what General Charles Krulak, the former Marine commandant, used to call
the Three Block War. ... We are extending the concept a bit, and
beginning to talk about adding a new dimension. ... The Four Block War
adds a new but very relevant dimension to situations like the
counterinsurgency in Iraq.32

The so-called "green men" became the symbol of the Western discourse on
hybrid warfare in early 2014, when Russia invaded the Crimean peninsula
from Ukraine. As the hybrid warfare narrative goes, these unidentified
green men without insignias---which in fact consisted of hundreds of
armed uniformed soldiers--- were the reason Russia was so successful in
taking Crimea. This narrative overlooks the fact that the government in
Kiev---and people around the Crimean peninsula---were very well informed
that these so-called green men were not Ukrainian military troops. So,
even if these armed Russian special operations forces soldiers were not
carrying insignias, there was plenty of evidence that they were not part
of the forces that were loyal to the government of Ukraine.

Thus, the decision not to stop or counterattack these invading
forces---which were clearly soldiers of organized armed forces ---was
not based on the notion that Ukrainian authorities did not know that
Crimea was being invaded. Inaction was based on the decision by the
government of Ukraine not to attack these invading forces, because (1)
Ukraine had no credible functioning armed forces, which could have
beaten the Russian soldiers without the whole military operation turning
into a bloodshed and slaughter of the Ukrainian military, and (2) the
culture of corruption had degraded the fighting capability and morale of
Ukraine's armed forces, so that Russian military could take the
garrisons around Crimea without any real fighting.33

The hybrid warfare narrative suggests that the use of nonconventional
"green men" and the associated obfuscation of the Ukrainian situational
awareness was the reason that the takeover of Crimea was so successful.
This narrative turns a blind eye to the fact that Ukraine had no real
usable military capability that had any chance of success against a
regional great power---namely Russia. Moreover, Russia had more than
10,000 soldiers stationed within its military bases in Crimea when the
"green men" suddenly appeared on the scene. At the same time, another
150,000 Russian military troops were in close proximity of Ukraine on
military exercises.34 Thus, whereas some Western statesmen and strategic
analysts may for a while have been confused by the true origins of the
so-called "green men," Ukrainian authorities knew that they should have
been capable of mustering military operations against these invading
forces, but they did not have the required military force, which could
have done the trick.

Even if the proponents of the hybrid warfare narrative could agree with
the analysis above, they would point out that as Western states'
situational awareness of what was going on in the Crimea was obfuscated,
they lost their possibility of acting against Russia's invasion in a
timely fashion. This line of reasoning bypasses the fact that the
Western states did not have the capabilities or the willingness to
commit any military force against Russia's invasion in support of
Ukraine.35 The fact is that there was almost nothing that Western states
could have done to halt the Russian invasion of Crimea even if they
wanted to, and they did not.

The second aspect of the Western narrative on hybrid warfare waged by
Russia accentuates the strategic use of nonmilitary tools. By
definition, the true essence of war is related---but not limited---to
the use of large-scale high-quality violence, that is, military force.
Nonetheless, to analyse war without a political context and the diverse
spheres of human interactions that are connected to the military sphere
resonates well within the post-Cold War Western tendency to see warfare
from a simplistic, mechanistic and technocratic perspective. This
Western strategic myopia has evolved from the RMA thesis and the
associated possibilities of waging war (operations) with a high reliance
on force protection in the many wars of choice that the West has
undertaken during the last two decades.36 The technocratic Western
understanding of war---looking at pursuing politically defined goals
with the use of large-scale violence through the prism of high-tech
capabilities and force-protection possibilities---has been challenged in
Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya where superior Western military capability
has not translated into politically defined goals during the last 15
years.

The technocratic high-tech Western focus on war has thus maturated in
the past two decades. The emergence of the concept "comprehensive
approach" testifies to the problems that Western states have confronted
since they have gone out-of-area with the RMA approach on the use of
military force. As the Alliance Joint Doctrine (2010) notes:

From a military perspective, a comprehensive approach is founded on not
only a shared situational understanding, but also recognition that
sometimes nonmilitary actors may support the military and conversely on
other occasions the military's role will be supporting those actors. . .
The importance of including from the outset those elements --
diplomatic, civil, and economic -- that are to be enabled by military
success must not be underestimated. Failure to do so will at best lose
the strategic initiative; at worst, it will result in strategic failure.
This is the basic premise of a comprehensive approach, which NATO
applies to its operations.37

Thus, NATO member-states have jointly agreed upon the notion that purely
military solutions to political problems are rarely possible. Strategic
goals should be pursued with a mix of political, economic, cultural and
in some cases also military means. This has been the essence of
statecraft for centuries---or even millennia. Military analysts and
strategic thinkers have understood war from a broad perspective for at
least 2,500 years---since the days of Sun Tzu (or Sunzi). War has never
been a "pure" military matter that is executed by military forces only.
The formulation of the Comprehensive Approach within the European Union
reflects the same understanding:

The EU's Comprehensive Approach (CA) envisages the concerted use of the
wide array of policies, tools and instruments at the disposal of the EU,
spanning the diplomatic, security, defence, financial, trade,
development cooperation and humanitarian aid fields.38

The above-mentioned definitions of the Comprehensive Approach both
within the EU and NATO reflect the fact that for years Western strategic
thinkers and statesmen have been painfully aware that military
operations in and by themselves are not enough to produce favourable
international security outcomes. Nor are purely military operations
enough for the attainment on national interests in most cases. Based on
the analytical similarities between the concepts of hybrid warfare and
the Comprehensive Approach, it could be argued that the Comprehensive
Approach has in fact been a Western hybrid warfare technique for example
in Afghanistan, where military momentum and rising troop levels have not
guaranteed "victory." And as the Secretary General of NATO, Jens
Stoltenberg, has argued:

... how to deal with hybrid warfare? Hybrid is the dark reflection of
our comprehensive approach. We use a combination of military and
non-military means to stabilize countries. Others use it to destabilize
them.39

[The third argument in favour of the hybrid warfare thesis has revolved
around]{.underline} Russia's **[information warfare]{.underline}** and
its use of government controlled media houses and internet trolls (or
troll armies) to change public perceptions of Russia's actions in
Ukraine. This strategic level information warfare---partly using
internet trolls and partly other modern means to lie and to distort and
modify the truth--- has supposedly improved Russia's possibilities at
reaching its goals in Ukraine and more broadly within the international
system. Through the "weaponization of information," Russia has arguably
successfully obfuscated what was going on in Crimea in March 2014 and
what is currently happening in eastern Ukraine.

[What]{.underline} the [proponents of this information warfare
argument]{.underline} often seem to [neglect, however, is the fact that
since]{.underline} the invasion of [Crimea]{.underline} in early 2014,
[Russia has become a **pariah state** targeted with]{.underline}
political and economic [sanctions]{.underline}. Its proxy war in Eastern
Ukraine has not gone unnoticed and the associated narrative about its
noninvolvement does not resonate among Western strategic decision
makers. Statesmen do not make decisions with information collected from
internet discussion forums or from adversaries' officials' public
statements. [It is **extremely difficult**]{.underline}---with even the
best of narratives ---[to create a long-standing "**alternative
reality**" or **shared understanding**]{.underline}, which departs from
preexisting conceptualisations and shared understandings, [and which is
**contradictory** to]{.underline} the "**[facts]{.underline}** on the
ground."

[It is true]{.underline} that today [anyone can]{.underline} get his or
[her message out]{.underline} in some form--- whether it is through
conventional media sources or social media. However, [it is a different
thing to say]{.underline} that [it would]{.underline} be easy to [change
preexisting narratives or]{.underline} to [create new ones.]{.underline}
Narratives influence how people conceptualize reality. Moreover,
narratives constitute identities. Narratives are not only stories that
can be made up by anyone. They are deep-seated cultural constructs
through which people infer meaning about the social world. Thus,
[narratives are **resistant** to **change**]{.underline}. Changing
narratives implies changes to the way people see the world and how they
identify themselves. Narratives have a strong bias on status quo over
change.40

When it comes to the use---or nonuse---of information, Russia was
successful in its annexation of Crimea on the basis that it did not a
priori reveal its intentions or methods for executing the land-grab.
Russia thus departed from the postCold War Western method of publicly
arguing in favour of and "selling" an upcoming military operation.
However, [it should be noted that even with this successful obfuscation
of the situational awareness of **Ukraine's government** and **Western
states**]{.underline} for some hours or maybe even days[, the
possibilities of Ukraine's **armed forces** to resist the Russian
invasion were]{.underline} practically [**nonexistent**. The difference
in **military capability** between]{.underline} Russia and Ukraine
[was]{.underline} ---and still is ---so **[staggering]{.underline}**.

[The fourth aspect of the hybrid warfare thesis revolves
around]{.underline} another strategic hype concept, that of **[cyber
warfare]{.underline}**. For many years---at least since the 2007
Estonian Bronze Warrior episode---cyber threats and cyber warfare have
been proposed to fundamentally change the nature of warfare. Resonating
with the logic of the RMA discourse in the 1990s and during the next
decade, cyber warfare advocates and cyber threat prophets have moved to
securitize the cyberspace. Waging war in cyberspace offered a way to
conceptualize new vulnerabilities in Western societies and new
asymmetric means of warfare that could threaten us, despite the fact
that none of these cyber warfare elements had ever materialized on the
"battlefield."

So far, the things that we have witnessed have been related to denial of
service attacks, infiltration of social media and e-mail accounts as
well as other similar low-yield small-level incidents. Most of the
reported [cyber "warfare'" episodes have been **criminal acts** directed
against **individuals** or **enterprises**. Concerning]{.underline} real
[**cyber war** incidents---with]{.underline} tangible national
[**security effects**---Libicki]{.underline} has [argued]{.underline}
based on his analysis on the war in Ukraine [that one of the
**surprising features** has been the **lack** of **cyber
war**]{.underline} almost completely.

For the last twenty years, with the advent of serious thinking about
"cyber war," most [analysts]{.underline}---and even the more skeptical
thinkers---[have been convinced]{.underline} that all future [kinetic
wars]{.underline} between modern countries [would have a]{.underline}
clear [**cyber** component. However, the]{.underline} current
[Russo-Ukrainian conflict is **challenging this**]{.underline} widely
held notion. . . . [The]{.underline} most [notable thing
about]{.underline} the war in **[Ukraine]{.underline}**, however, [is
the **near-complete absenc**e of any]{.underline} perceptible **[cyber
war]{.underline}**.41

The absence of cyber warfare in the hard core of security and defence
issues so far does not mean that cyber threats are irrelevant to states
at the strategic level. Needless to say, our ever increasing dependence
and reliance on networked information and services make managing the
cyber domain critical. Thus, [it is noteworthy that]{.underline} so far
[the **threats** and **possibilities** of cyber warfare have been
**inflated** and are closer to **science-fiction** than **real
life.**]{.underline}

Introduction

**[Hybrid warfare]{.underline}** is one of the most common terms used to
describe present-day warfare. Nevertheless, it [is]{.underline} still
quite [contested. There is no **commonly accepted definition** of hybrid
warfare]{.underline}. Furthermore, the definitions regarding the hybrid
model of warfare considerably differ from each other. For this reason,
[hybrid warfare has been]{.underline} severely [criticized
by]{.underline} many security [experts as being a **catch-all
concept**]{.underline} (see, e.g., Van Puyvelde 2015, Charap 2015, 51;
Kofman and Rojansky 2015; Jordan 2017; Caliskan and Cramers 2018, 2).

The primary objective of this article is to analyse why the concept of
hybrid warfare is so contested in the way it has so far been
conceptualised by international security scholars and practitioners. In
addition, [this article will]{.underline} briefly [discuss]{.underline}
possible [implications of the **lack** of **conceptual clarity**
surrounding **hybrid warfare** for the West's **defence
policy**]{.underline}.

This article argues that the main reason why the explanatory value of
the concept of hybrid warfare diminishes is that it has been taken out
of its original context over time. Hence, [conceptual links between
the]{.underline} so-called [**examples**/**case studies**]{.underline}
[of 'hybrid warfare' seem]{.underline} quite **[shaky]{.underline}**.
The evolution of the concept of hybrid warfare quite fit Giovanni
Sartori's notion of conceptual stretching. Before proceeding to analyse
to what extent the concept of hybrid warfare has been stretched, let us
take a brief look at the conceptual stretching.

What is Conceptual Stretching?

The term conceptual stretching first appeared in Sartori's work Concept
Misformation in Comparative Politics in 1970. According to Sartori
(1970, 1034), "the wider the world under investigation, the more we need
conceptual tools that are able to travel." That is, Sartori argues that
scholars require to apply existing concepts to new cases to make
worldwide and cross-area comparisons. Nevertheless, Sartori (1970, 1034)
argues, when concepts travel, they usually are stretched. This is
because the application of concepts to new cases adds new dimensions to
the original meaning of the concept. Sartori named this problem
conceptual stretching. For Sartori (1970, 1035), [the]{.underline}
natural [outcome of **conceptual stretching** is that
concepts]{.underline} come to [lose]{.underline} some of [their
**precision**]{.underline}.

Sartori's notion of conceptual stretching has gained significant
traction in social sciences. Synthesising Sartori's ideas, Collier and
Mahon (1993, 845) have characterised conceptual stretching as "the
distortion that occurs when a concept does not fit the new cases."
Carlsson (2017, 148) describes conceptual stretching as "using valuable
concepts with clear meaning to refer to inapplicable phenomena."
Mitchell (2005, 42) argues that "conceptual stretching results from
taking a set of concepts and applying them to new cases when these new
cases are not comparable to the original set." According to
Marsteintredet and Malamud (2020, 1024), "falling into the trap of
conceptual stretching means identifying two different phenomena by the
same name."

So far, political scientists have mentioned a wide range of concepts
subjected to conceptual stretching including democracy, deliberation,
coup, clientelism, globalisation, populism, ideology, and capitalism
(see e.g., Collier and Mahon 1993; Hilgers 2011; Regan 2017;
Marsteintredet and Malamud 2020; Steiner 2008). This article argues that
[the evolution of **hybrid warfare** can be considered as one of the
clear-cut examples of **conceptual stretching**]{.underline} too. In
that sense, the next section will reveal how and in what ways the
concept of hybrid warfare has been stretched so far.

Stretching Hybrid Warfare

Hybrid warfare has been included in the West's strategic lexicon as a
battlefield-oriented concept. Generally speaking, the initial proponents
of the concept of hybrid warfare have used it to describe a type of
warfare that combine regular and irregular military forces.1 In other
words, according to the originators of the concept, hybrid warfare is a
form of warfare that is neither purely conventional nor purely
irregular. For example, in British Counterinsurgency in the
Post-imperial Era, Mockaitis (1995, 16) stated that the Indonesian
Confrontation "was a hybrid war, combining low intensity conventional
engagements with insurgency." Subsequently, in 1998, Robert G. Walker
revitalised the term hybrid warfare in his master's thesis titled SPEC
FI: the United States Marine Corps and Special Operations. According to
Walker (1998, 4), "hybrid warfare is that which lies in the interstices
between special and conventional warfare." Thereafter, in 2002, the term
hybrid warfare reappeared again in William J. Nemeth's master's thesis,
Future War, and Chechnya: A Case for Hybrid Warfare. In his thesis,
Nemeth (2002, 54) argued that "\[w\]hile not true guerrillas \[Chechen
fighters\] also cannot be accurately classified as a conventional
force." In the years that followed, a few scholars such as Dupont (2003,
55), Carayannis (2003, 232) and Simpson (2005) have used the concept of
hybrid warfare to refer to a type of warfare that can be classified
neither purely regular nor irregular as well. Nevertheless, in the
context of hybrid warfare, the academic and practical implications of
these authors were relatively limited.

In the existing literature, the term [hybrid warfare is]{.underline}
often [attributed to]{.underline} Frank G. [Hoffman]{.underline}. This
is because the term itself gained currency after Hoffman published a
series of papers regarding the topic (see e.g., Hoffman 2007; Hoffman
2009a; Hoffman 2009b). In his seminal monograph, Conflict in the 21st
Century: The Rise of Hybrid Wars, Hoffman (2007, 8) argued that [the
hybrid model of warfare consists of]{.underline} a combination of [four
elements: conventional capabilities, irregular tactics, terrorism, and
organised crime]{.underline}. Hoffman (2007, 36) argued that Hezbollah's
way of warfare employed against Israel Defence Forces during the Second
Lebanon War represents a pre -eminent example of the hybrid model of
warfare. In addition, Hoffman has also argued that hybrid warfare can be
conducted by state actors. In this sense, Hoffman (2007, 28) asserts
that "states can shift their conventional units to irregular formations
and adopt new tactics, as Iraq's Fedayeen did in 2003." So, the concept
of hybrid warfare, as characterised by Hoffman, implies irregular
fighters with advanced conventional weapons and state actors who adopt
non -traditional tactics.

In one respect, Hoffman's conceptualising of hybrid warfare resembles
that of his predecessors. This is because both the aforementioned
authors and Hoffman concentrate on a mode of warfare in which regular
and irregular forces are of use. As such, the idea of hybrid warfare, as
characterised by the originators, mainly entails the employment of overt
military. Nevertheless, unlike his predecessors, Hoffman specifically
focuses on the blurring of the lines between conventional and irregular
warfare in the same battlespace. In the words of Hoffman (2007, 8):

At the strategic level, many wars have had regular and irregular
components. However, in most conflicts, these components occurred in
different theaters or in distinctly different formations. In Hybrid
Wars, these forces become blurred into the same force in the same
battlespace.

Subsequently, the concept of hybrid warfare has gained significant
traction, particularly in the US military circles. In 2010, the Training
Circular of the US Department of the Army (2010, 1 -1) codified a hybrid
threat as "the diverse and dynamic combination of regular forces,
irregular forces, and/or criminal elements all unified to achieve
mutually benefitting effects." Likewise, in 2011, the US Joint Forces
Command defined a hybrid threat as \"\[a\]ny adversary that
simultaneously and adaptively employs a tailored mix of conventional,
irregular, terrorism and criminal means or activities in the operational
battle space" (Fleming 2011, 2). Apparently, these definitions reflect
Frank Hoffman's understanding of hybrid warfare to a large extent. That
is to say, the US military has considered hybrid warfare as a fusion of
regular and irregular modes of warfare in the same battlefield.

Although various alternative definitions of hybrid warfare have been
produced during this period (see, e.g., Bond 2007; McCuen 2008; Glenn
2009, NATO 2010; Burbridge 2013), [until 2014, the concept of **hybrid
warfare** has]{.underline} mostly [been understood as]{.underline} a
form of [warfare in which **regular** and **irregular elements** are
used in a highly coordinated way]{.underline}. However, [the
connotations of]{.underline} the concept of [hybrid warfare were
**radically changed** after Russian intervention in **Ukraine**. This is
because the Russian activities]{.underline} in Ukraine [dubbed **hybrid
warfare** did not]{.underline} quite [fit any]{.underline} of the
[preceding conceptualisations of hybrid warfare.]{.underline}

Briefly speaking, [Russia attained]{.underline} its [**political goals**
in Ukraine by employing non -conventional means and
techniques]{.underline} such as [conducting **covert operations**, using
**surrogate forces**, carrying out **cyber -attacks** and]{.underline}
mounting [**misinformation campaigns** without]{.underline} waging
**[formally declared war]{.underline}**. In this respect, the Russian
government has consistently denied its active military involvement in
Ukraine despite evidence saying otherwise. Accordingly,
[after]{.underline} Russian intervention in Ukraine[, non
-kinetic]{.underline} methods and [techniques came to the **fore**
in]{.underline} the [definitions of hybrid warfare.]{.underline}
Moreover, military aspects of hybrid warfare have generally been
associated with covert and/or indirect actions.

For example, [NATO's]{.underline} (n.d) [website]{.underline} currently
[declares that]{.underline}:

[Hybrid threats]{.underline} combine military and non -military as well
as covert and overt means, [includ]{.underline}ing [disinformation,
cyber attacks, economic pressure, deployment of]{.underline} irregular
[armed groups]{.underline} and use of regular forces. [Hybrid
methods]{.underline} are used to [blur]{.underline} the lines between
[war and peace]{.underline}, and attempt to sow doubt in the minds of
target populations. They aim to destabilise and undermine societies.

Like NATO, the European Union have conceptualised hybrid warfare as a
way of achieving political goals by using a fusion of kinetic and non
-kinetic tools while remaining below the threshold of formally declared
war (European Commission 2016). Clearly, [these definitions]{.underline}
of hybrid warfare [give]{.underline} particular [importance to
**covertness** and non-attributable methods and]{.underline} thus
[consider **hybrid attacks** as]{.underline} activities remaining [below
the **threshold** of **war**]{.underline}. And admittedly, [this
**conceptualisation**]{.underline} of hybrid warfare [differs from the
**previous**, **battlefield-centric** understanding of **hybrid
warfare**.]{.underline}

Furthermore, in the years that followed, Western politicians, authors,
and media have continued to apply the concept of hybrid warfare to the
new cases. More importantly, although, [after 2014]{.underline}, the
construct of [hybrid warfare]{.underline} is mostly defined as the
combination of military and non -military tools, the term [has also been
used to refer to **non -violent** disruptive **actions**]{.underline}.
For example, former US Secretary of State Rex [Tillerson
stated]{.underline} that [Russia's]{.underline} alleged [meddling
2016]{.underline} US [presidential election is an act of **hybrid
warfare**]{.underline} (EURACTIV 2017). Likewise, [the EU]{.underline}
has [accused Belarus of conducting **hybrid warfare**]{.underline} by
[encouraging migrants to cross into **Europe**]{.underline} through its
borders (BBC 2021). A Der Spiegel (2016) article has declared that
"Putin wages hybrid war on Germany and West," but, indeed, the article
was almost entirely about black propaganda and influence operations
allegedly conducted by Russia. [Labelling]{.underline} these [non
-violent]{.underline} subversive [activities as **hybrid
warfare**]{.underline} obviously [represents a **significant departure**
from **previous approaches**]{.underline} to the hybrid model of
warfare. This article [argues]{.underline} that [this]{.underline}
departure [represents]{.underline} Sartori's notion of **[conceptual
stretching]{.underline}** to a notable extent.

Consequently, as a travelling concept, hybrid warfare has constantly
been applied to new cases. Undeniably, the application of the concept of
hybrid warfare to the new cases that lack features of the concept has
broadened the meaning of hybrid warfare. Currently, [the lack of
**conceptual clarity**]{.underline} surrounding the concept [reduces its
**explanatory power**. This could]{.underline} also [lead
to]{.underline} serious [implications for the West's **defence
planning**]{.underline}. Hence, in the next section, [we]{.underline}
will briefly [discuss the]{.underline} potential [implications of such
poor **definitional**/**conceptual clarity**]{.underline}.

Implications for the West's Defence Policy

As Wither (2016, 74) has underlined, "[defining hybrid warfare is
**not** just an **academic** exercise]{.underline}". This is because, as
emphasised in the previous section, Western [states]{.underline}
currently [refer to **hybrid threats** in]{.underline} their
[**strategy** and **policy documents**]{.underline}. Likewise, Western
organisations such as **[NATO]{.underline}** and the European Union
[use]{.underline} the concept of [hybrid warfare to imply]{.underline}
contemporary [security threats]{.underline}. Hence, [the lack of
**conceptual clarity** surrounding **hybrid warfare** may lead to
**serious consequences**]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} most [**crucial consequence** of]{.underline} this
[conceptual ambiguity is that states cannot develop an **effective
strategy** to deal with]{.underline} what it deems as '**[hybrid
threats]{.underline}**. Logically, [it is not possible to develop
a]{.underline}n efficient [**defence strategy** against a threat that is
not **exactly identified** in its **scope** and
**features**]{.underline}.

To provide a better understanding of this situation, it is useful to
make an analogy between terrorism and hybrid warfare.
[Terrorism]{.underline} is undoubtedly one of the greatest security
threats to peace. However, it still [does not have a universally agreed
definition. The lack of consensus]{.underline} on the definition of
terrorism [creates]{.underline} [confusion about which organization
should be labelled]{.underline} a [terrorist]{.underline} organisation.
[This **obscurity** about the definition of terrorism has been
considered to be the most **fundamental cause** of the difficulty faced
in the fight against **terrorism**]{.underline}. The concept of [hybrid
warfare]{.underline} seems to be [suffer]{.underline}ing [the **same
fate**]{.underline}. Alongside the poor understanding of such a
phenomenon, the implications of the conceptual ambiguity can be observed
both in theory and in practice. In this regard, it would not be an
exaggeration to claim that [Western states have]{.underline} so far [had
a **poor record**]{.underline} [in negating **hybrid
threats**]{.underline} [when we think of]{.underline} the U.S/Europe
with China, the [**Ukraine**/**NATO** vis-à-vis **Russia**]{.underline}
and the West and allies vis-à-vis ISIS. Therefore, eliminating such a
conceptual haziness should be prioritised by Western policymakers and
defence intellectuals.

Conclusion

Hybrid warfare has become a buzzword among Western defence intellectuals
and practitioners over the last decade-plus. However, as noted
throughout the paper, there is no common definition of hybrid warfare.
Moreover, there is even no consensus about the key elements of the
hybrid model of warfare. This is because, this article argues, [hybrid
warfare has]{.underline} constantly [been subjected to **conceptual
stretching**]{.underline}.

[**Initially**, hybrid warfare has been incorporated into the
West\'s]{.underline} strategic [lexicon as a **battlefield-centric
concept**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [after **Russian intervention** in
**Ukraine**]{.underline}, the connotations of the concept of [hybrid
warfare]{.underline} remarkably [changed]{.underline}. Since then, [the
concept has]{.underline} often [been described as a way of achieving
**political goals**]{.underline} by [using a mix of **kinetic** and
**non-kinetic methods** while remaining **below** the threshold of the
**outright act** of **war**]{.underline}. On top of that, [over the last
**few years**, the concept of **hybrid warfare** has also been used to
just refer to **non-kinetic destabilising**]{.underline}
**[activities]{.underline}**. Consequently, [the significant
**differences** between **examples**/**case studies**]{.underline} have
[made hybrid warfare a rather **vague** and **ambiguous
concept**]{.underline}.

Today, [Western democracies are facing]{.underline} a wide range of
**[complex security threats]{.underline}**. Hence, [having
**clear**]{.underline} and **[welldefined]{.underline}** [paradigms
regarding these threats is of **significant importance**]{.underline}.
Currently, hybrid warfare is one of the most common terms used to
describe contemporary threats. However, this usage is not built on a
common understanding of what hybrid warfare entails. Although Western
states and institutions agree that they need to be prepared against
hybrid threats, they conceptualise hybrid warfare in different ways. For

1 Introduction

Over the last few years, [disinformation, information warfare and fake
news have become important]{.underline} strategic and political
[concepts in international relations]{.underline}(Cour la, 2020;
Lanoszka, 2019). Although these terms aren't new and are as old as the
term 'propaganda', [their]{.underline} mainstream [use]{.underline}
within the context of digital communication [skyrocketed after the 2016
US elections]{.underline} (Grinberg et al., 2019). However even [before
that, these terms]{.underline} had [begun to enter]{.underline} into the
foreign policy [discourse of NATO]{.underline} countries [following the
2014 Russian]{.underline} military [operations in Ukraine. Prior
to]{.underline} the [annexation of **Crimea**, Russia]{.underline} had
already [designated **information warfare** as part of its]{.underline}
2010 [Military Doctrine]{.underline}, which was updated again 2014 with
a special emphasis on digital communication (Renz, 2014). A year prior,
the importance of the digital space for military doctrinal
considerations was outlined by General Valery Gerasimov - Russian Chief
of the General Staff. In his 2013 article titled 'The Value of Science
is in the Foresight', [Gerasimov wrote: "The]{.underline} very '[rules
of war]{.underline}' have [changed. The role of nonmilitary
means]{.underline} of achieving political and strategic goals [has
grown, and]{.underline}, in many cases, [they have exceeded]{.underline}
the power of force of [weapons in]{.underline} their
[effectiveness]{.underline}. ... All this is supplemented by military
means of a concealed character." (Galeotti, 2019) These three texts are
generally accepted as the doctrinal basis of modern Russian information
operations that were demonstrated both in Ukraine in 2014, and later in
Syria, after mid-2015 (Sinovets, Renz, 2015).

Since then, strategic communicative [actions]{.underline} that are
intended [to]{.underline} influence, [mislead and confuse foreign
populations]{.underline} have [assumed a **central position** in
**global debates**]{.underline} about politics and foreign policy.
[Given the impact of]{.underline} such [actions on **elections**,
**polarization** and **crisis management**, it was natural]{.underline}
for the rhetoric about these actions to assume such a central
position(Bradshaw, Howard, 2018). However, over time, popular
[**buzzwords** like '**disinformation**/**misinformation'**, '**fake
news**', and '**information operations**']{.underline} have
[proliferated]{.underline} in global political mainstream discourse [and
assumed an **accusatory nature**]{.underline} worldwide [as]{.underline}
more [**leaders**, **diplomats**, and **politicians**]{.underline} have
[begun using them to]{.underline} discredit and [**delegitimize** their
political opponents. This]{.underline} dynamic [was]{.underline} later
[conceptualized as '**discursive deflection**']{.underline} (Ross,
Rivers, 2018; Smith, 2019) [and became]{.underline} acutely [visible in
the **foreign policy** **domain**, as]{.underline} more
[countries]{.underline} have [begun **securitizing**]{.underline} the
concepts ['**fake news**', '**disinformation**', and '**information
warfare**']{.underline} [to]{.underline} similarly discredit, and
**[delegitimize rival countries]{.underline}**(Baum, Potter, 2019).
Broadly speaking, ['**discursive-deflection'**]{.underline} [is the
strategy of discrediting **competitors** and rivals by portraying
oneself as the]{.underline} sole [**source** of **truth**]{.underline}.
While the domestic political use of these terms is well-studied, we are
still somewhat in the dark with regard to why countries choose to
securitize these terms and what happens in their interactions with other
countries when they do so.

[The **foreign policy** use]{.underline} of such terms predates the 2016
US elections and [proliferated after]{.underline} the Russian military
involvement in [Crimea]{.underline} and Donbas (Khaldarova, Pantti,
2016). The primary reason for this contextual proliferation was the
Russian decision to deny the initial stages of its involvement in
Ukraine and its broader strategy of distracting and dividing Western
attention over Russian military operations (Mejias, Vokuev, 2017).
[There is]{.underline} still [a debate over whether it was really
Russian information op]{.underline}eration[s that]{.underline} had
[derailed **NATO response** in **Ukraine**, or if disinformation
**discourses** are employed]{.underline} in [order to shift the
blame]{.underline} over [to Russia]{.underline} at a time [when NATO was
**already divided** over its **commitment** to **Ukraine**]{.underline}
(Lysenko, Brooks, 2018). While there is robust evidence of Russian
information operations in Ukraine and its role in spreading
disinformation in NATO countries, [sustained **NATO apathy** towards
rising Russian]{.underline} military [influence in the **Black Sea**
after **2014** and **Syria** after **2015** support the **latter
claim**]{.underline}.

Critics of [Western **disinformation discourses**]{.underline} for
example, argue that such discourses have [turned into
'**floating**]{.underline} (or empty) [**signifiers**', that have
no]{.underline} specific or [agreed-upon meaning]{.underline} (Farkas,
Schou, 2018). In that vein, [blaming others for]{.underline} engaging in
[disinformation]{.underline} often [distracts attention]{.underline}
away [from a]{.underline} mistake or [**failed policy** enacted by the
blamer]{.underline} (Monsees, 2020). In this case, critics argue that
[Western discourses on **disinformation**]{.underline} are intended to
[distract attention]{.underline} away [from **NATO**]{.underline} or EU
[**divisions**, or]{.underline} more [domestic]{.underline}level
[polarization dynamics, by creating a]{.underline} unique **[empty
signifier]{.underline}** ([disinformation]{.underline}) [that is
employed as a **rallying rhetoric** that bolsters]{.underline} the
significance of **[external threats]{.underline}** (Mas-Manchón et al.,
2021). This way, [disinformation and]{.underline} its associated terms
like [**misinformation**, **fake news** and **information war** get
**securitized**, receiving disproportionate]{.underline} levels of
[attention in the **policy domain**]{.underline}. In this context,
[disinformation]{.underline} and its associated terms are used to
[exaggerate an **existing threat** and]{.underline} create a rallying
discourse that would [channel]{.underline} the [attention
of]{.underline} the [divided]{.underline} Western [nations away
from]{.underline} their [internal disagreements, and towards an
**inflated external threat**]{.underline}. Some scholars go even
further, arguing that disinformation is being securitized in the West
(especially in NATO) to the extent the 'war on terror' was securitized
through the 2000s (Lanoszka, 2019). In this line, [disinformation
is]{.underline} alleged to have become [a new **strategic glue**
that]{.underline} would [help Western nations pool in]{.underline} their
increasingly [diverging interests and resources into a **common
cause**]{.underline} (Baumann, 2020).

Securitization of disinformation in domestic politics is relatively
well-studied (Freelon, Wells, 2020; Neo, 2021). Although these terms
have entered into mainstream debate after the 2016 US elections, former
President Donald [Trump]{.underline} too, had [securitized **fake news**
to delegitimize]{.underline} his [opponents by constructing]{.underline}
rival [**disinformation** as a **national security
problem**,]{.underline} indirectly attributable to China (Polletta,
Callahan, 2019). Following the tornado of accusations in the US,
political actors in Britain, France, Italy, South Africa, Kenya and
others have begun blaming each other for engaging in organized
disinformation (Maweu, 2019; Saurwein, Spencer-Smith, 2020). Even in
Sweden, there is empirical evidence that suggests accusing journalists
of spreading fake news results in self-censorship of such outlets
(Bennett, Livingston, 2018). There are further cases of evidence
supporting the claim that elite-level discourses on disinformation have
a direct effect on how the wider society perceives information and facts
in general, creating a measurable effect on public trust towards such
facts and information (Van Duyn, Collier, 2019). In Singapore for
example, delegitimizing rival parties and news outlets through
disinformation discourse is considered 'acceptable', as part of the
state's duty to discipline the opposition and its political actors (Tan,
2020). Similar trends emerging in democracies and authoritarian
countries alike, such as in Austria, Australia, Poland, Russia, and
South Africa, demonstrate the universality of instrumentalizing
disinformation discourse as a political delegitimization tactic
(Kurowska, Reshetnikov, 2018; Tandoc et al., 2018).

While a robust scholarship is emerging on the domestic political uses of
disinformation discourse, there has so far been no longitudinal, large-N
study that explored how such constructions emerge in international
politics. Furthermore, there has so far been no exploration of how such
discourses evolve over time and under what contexts in foreign affairs.
We know that disinformation and fake news are important issues in world
politics and that they are frequently used to bring an issue to public
attention, but we are more in the dark over the contextual and temporal
nuances that drive how these concepts are discursively constructed in
foreign policy discourse.

[This study]{.underline} aims to [provide an]{.underline} early
[addition to]{.underline} the [emerging literature on **foreign policy
uses** of **disinformation**]{.underline} discourses [by focusing on
how]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(**[NATO]{.underline}**) has [used them]{.underline} in its documents
and social media posts. It does so by studying 238,452 tweets from
official NATO and affiliated accounts, and more than 2,000 NATO texts,
news, statements, and publications using computational methods since
January 2014 and presents an unsupervised structural topic model (stm)
analysis to explore the main thematic and discursive contexts of these
texts. Ultimately, we hope to trigger a wider debate on the
securitization of disinformation and fake news in foreign policy, and
the greater explanatory value of computational methods in studying
large-N text data in studying such securitization strategies.

2 Securitizing Disinformation

Over the last few years, defining what misleading content is and how to
measure the legitimacy of its dissemination has been at the forefront of
journalistic, political and scientific debate (Tandoc et al., 2018).
Even before its proliferation in 2016, disinformation was a widely-used
term in the mainstream discourse, co-existing with other terms such as
infoglut, or information overload (Andrejevic, 2013). Although at first
disinformation and misinformation were terms used interchangeably,
today, disinformation refers to the deliberate dissemination of false
information with the intention to mislead and confuse its audiences.
Misinformation, on the other hand, strictly defines unintended diffusion
of false information by mistake, without malintent. There are also
bridge terms such as 'malinformation' that is factually accurate but is
deployed to harm and damage an individual or an entity, or the concept
of 'problematic information' as defined by Caroline Jack (Jack, 2017;
Morgan, 2018). Although it is not directly mentioned, all of these
concepts refer to the digital space, where information manipulation is
disseminated faster and wider on social media and digital communication
technologies compared to more media forms of media.

[As terms '**disinformation**/**misinformation**', '**fake news**',
'**information operation**]{.underline}'[, and '**hybrid war'**
are]{.underline} often [used interchangeably]{.underline} in political
discourse[, there are no clear-cut differences in the strategic topic of
each word choice]{.underline} (Guess, Lyons, 2020).
[Politicians]{.underline} and leaders can often [use these terms as a
**bag of buzzwords**, without a clear]{.underline} operational
[definition of what each of them]{.underline} precisely [means.
Each]{.underline} of these buzzwords [generate]{.underline} roughly
[the]{.underline} same effect on the consumers of such messages, which
is the [delegitimization of their target]{.underline} (Tucker et al.,
2018). Especially problematic is the fact that once the discourse on
disinformation is weaponized to delegitimize rivals, there is very
little such rivals can do to defend themselves. Given the significant
political charge of these terms, individuals or institutions that are
alleged to be engaging in disinformation-related activities often have
to enter into a fruitless spar of words to challenge such allegations,
which usually leads to further controversy. This renders the accuser -
or the side that securitizes disinformation - more advantageous compared
to the accused, generating a dynamic similar to the 'attacker's
advantage' in cyber security where the defender is continuously
blindsided (Tong et al., 2020).

Therefore, [the **securitization** of **disinformation**]{.underline} -
that is, discursively constructing disinformation as a security
concern - [is]{.underline} becoming almost as controversial as
disinformation itself, and can often be [deployed to muddle]{.underline}
the [waters of a healthy debate. Its problem lies within its
**success**; namely how successfully **disinformation** gets
**securitized** and rallies **policy resources**]{.underline} around
itself. [This fits into **Buzan**]{.underline} et. al. [**criteria** for
a '**successful speech-act**', which takes places in a
medium]{.underline} most [appropriate for its **dissemination** and have
a **clear**, **mobilizable referent object**]{.underline} (i.e. 'those
that spread disinformation') (Buzan et al., 1998). [By securitizing
disinformation in the **medium**]{.underline} that is [most conducive
for]{.underline} its [**dissemination** (social media and Internet),
speakers]{.underline} get a chance to [use]{.underline} the [speed and
volume advantage]{.underline} of digital communication technologies
[against their opponents]{.underline}. Also, such discursive
constructions must be sedimented (1) rhetorically: have a clear
argumentative function, (2) discursively: contain clear power and
hegemonic relations within, (3) culturally: refer to a well-known case
or instance, and (4) institutionally: in a way that mobilizes policy
resources (Williams, 2003).

[Yet for the **Copenhagen school**, not all speech acts constitute
**securitization**. Securitization is a]{.underline} very [particular
**discursive construct** that designates a]{.underline} specific
[**existential threat** that requires the mobilization of **uncommon
resources** and measures that go beyond]{.underline} the
[norms]{.underline} of institutional and political responses (Knudsen,
2001). In many cases, securitization happens to trigger and facilitate
these institutional changes by 'shocking' power brokers and
bureaucracies into action either through internal bureaucratic peer
pressure, or through public opinion pressure (audience costs). As such,
[disinformation has been lifted '**above politics**' in Western rhetoric
as a **peculiar threat** that requires]{.underline} a
[sidelining]{.underline} of daily [political squabbles,
mobilizing]{.underline} unique [resources and addressing it
in]{.underline} **[unity]{.underline}** that would otherwise cannot
materialize (Buzan, Wæver, 2009). Ultimately the discursive
[constructions of **disinformation** do constitute]{.underline} acute
[cases of **securitization** as they generate **amity-enmity
relations**]{.underline} [among countries that adopt this]{.underline}
discursive strategy[, versus those that **do not**]{.underline} (Buzan,
Wæver, 2009).

Social media offers a unique challenge for the study of securitization.
Traditionally, such securitizing statements are extracted from lengthy
speeches and texts through discourse analysis. However, the advent of
faster and higher-volume digital communication technologies have led to
a shift of state and elite discourses from older to newer media systems
(Balzacq et al., 2016). To that end neither Facebook, nor Twitter or
Instagram provides contiguous discursive framing opportunities for
researchers to study securitization dynamics due to their word limits
(Bouvier, Machin, 2018). Furthermore, since elite and state-level
discourses on social media are often written by assistants,
communications representatives or PR firms, they don't constitute
'performative actions' that are the cornerstone of securitization
(Lipizzi et al., 2016). This generates a significant 'context gap',
where researchers may not fully understand the wider thematic and
lexical ecosystem that such social media posts may inhabit. Interpreting
securitization in such media platforms thus necessitates more robust
techniques of 'horizon scanning' that allows researchers to extract
long-term discursive variances and contexts.

Computational text analysis methods largely deliver this horizon
scanning. Where social media posts lack in word and character limits,
they provide an immense volume of data that provides ample context in
longitudinal analysis. By extracting large quantities of text data from
social media, researchers can not only interpret the changing contours
and contexts of securitization, but they can also cross-check these
findings with more traditional forms of discursive construction outlets
such as speeches, documents and archival

**\[Omit Table 1\]**

material. That is why in this study, we not only engage in a large-scale
longitudinal 'old form' securitization analysis by focusing on NATO
archives, but also add in 'new form' analysis by extracting a large
tweet dataset of official NATO accounts.

The logic of interpreting how disinformation gets securitized through
relying on NATO documents is two-fold: first, [NATO has been evolving to
find new **raisons d'être** after]{.underline} the end of [the **Cold
War** and sought to capitalize on]{.underline} the [securitizations of
**new**]{.underline} forms of [**threats**, such as **terrorism**,
**cybersecurity**]{.underline}, Syria and forced migration (Stritzel,
Chang, 2015). [**Disinformation** and **information war** are
two]{.underline} of the [recent additions to this **threat portfolio**
and help]{.underline}s [us understand how **NATO's discourses** on
security adapt]{.underline} to a new-medium threat. Second, it enables
us to understand how institutional [security arrangements like **NATO**
reinvent]{.underline} their [security identities and
construct]{.underline} their [amity-enmity relations in light of
**new**]{.underline}er **[tech]{.underline}**nologies. Since identity
and action are considered closely linked in constructivism, and that
they are never fixed or intrinsic but rather fluid and are constituted
through social processes, studying longitudinal securitization dynamics
gives us valuable insight over long-term NATO security planning
(Mälksoo, 2018)

3 Methodology

Since this study is interested in the longitudinal dynamics of how
disinformation and related terms were securitized, and since the volume
of text that we are dealing with is quite large, we follow a
computational methodology that combines social media text data
extraction methods with traditional text analysis tools. In recent years
social media data has grown into a useful study area for social
scientists as more and more governmental documents become digitized and
such governments start taking an active role on social media (DiMaggio,
2015). Although traditional forms of text analysis and discourse
analysis approaches use hand coding schemes, newer methods in text
mining and analysis are increasingly more preferred due to their ability
to process large quantities of text data and eliminate the inter-coder
reliability issues from the equation (Krippendorff, 2004). Moreover,
these newer methods increase the causal robustness of text data by
building inter- and intra-text causal inferences, strengthening the
explanatory power of words as dependent or independent variables.

**\[Omit Table 2\]**

In order to explore how NATO has securitized disinformation in recent
years, we have scraped 238,452 tweets from NATO and official affiliated
accounts from January 2014 to February 2021 and extracted more than 2000
speeches, press releases, reviews, official texts, archival documents
and publications from the NATO e-library (?). Out of this sample, we
have extracted documents and content that contained the keywords
'disinformation', 'misinformation', 'fake news', 'propaganda', 'hybrid
warfare' and 'information warfare', and logged the number of their
occurrences within these texts by date. Since this study doesn't focus
on the semantic differences between these keywords and consider them as
different references to disinformation as a discursive strategy, we code
and merge them singularly as variable 'disinfo'. Our preliminary
analysis shows that NATO has used these keywords most frequently in
tweets, followed by speeches, reviews and publications. However, when
analyzed proportionally, NATO publications focus on disinformation most
frequently (75% of all documents), followed by tweets (40%), reviews
(36.97%) and official texts (21.05%).

In this study, we employ structural topic modeling (STM) - a text
analysis approach that finds 'topics' in an unstructured corpus based on
covariate information (Roberts et al., 2019). It follows a statistical
logic that measures co-occurrence likelihoods of keywords and terms that
are more likely to appear with each other and derives topical meanings
out of those likelihoods. Topic modeling is increasingly used in the
study of large volumes of text in social sciences such as large archival
documents, or social media text datasets by producing "each word on the
basis of some number of preceding words or word classes," and
"generate\[ing\] words based on latent topic variables inferred from
word correlations independent of the order in which the words appear"
(Wallach, 2006). In recent years topic modeling has become a widely-used
method to study large Twitter datasets, and political discussions that
happen on other social media platforms (Giles, 2012; Hong, Davison,
2010; Liang, Fu, 2015).

A longitudinal analysis of the specific keywords sorted by document type
reveals a clear difference in word choices between different NATO
documents. In NATO Basic Texts, the most-preferred reference keyword is
'hybrid warfare', whereas in press releases reliance on the word
'misinformation' gradually evolves into 'disinformation' by 2018. NATO
reviews also largely prefer 'misinformation', but NATO speeches and
tweets are more diverse with a heavier use of the term 'propaganda',
'disinformation' and 'fake news'. This difference is an interesting
demonstration how elastic these terms are and how different
institutional cultures and outlets can prefer one over the other in
their communication strategies.

**\[Omit Figure 1\]**

The difference between NATO official texts and tweets are particularly
interesting. Although NATO official texts shift from a 'hybrid war'
focused discourse to 'disinformation' focused discourse by 2018, the
reliance on 'disinformation' discourse in tweets is more striking. By
late-2016 (US elections) 'disinformation' becomes a clear discursive
choice in NATO tweets, skyrocketing in much of 2020, due to COVID and
vaccinerelated securitization discourses globally. This could be
interpreted as the discursive anchoring capacity of the United States
for NATO, as the constructions of securitization in American political
culture affects the wider institutional discourse of NATO. Perhaps as
the clearest sign of the temporal variations in word choice shifts,
NATO's Twitter accounts overwhelmingly use 'disinformation',
'information warfare', and 'misinformation words in comparison to its
official texts and statements, that rely on 'cyber war' and 'hybrid
war'. As for NATO and affiliated accounts that use the keyword
'disinformation', three clear accounts stand out. These are
\@STRATCOMCOE (NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence),
\@NATOmoscow (NATO Information Office Moscow), \@NATOBrazeB (NATO
Assistant Secretary General for Public Diplomacy), and \@NATOpress
(Official Twitter account of the \@NATO Spokesperson). As for which NATO
country

**\[Omit Figure 2\]**

**\[Omit Figure 3\]**

representations use this word the most, Latvia (@LV_NATO), Lithuania
(@LitdelNATO), United States (@USNATO), Ukraine (@NATOinUkraine) and
Germany (@GermanyNATO) stand out the most.

Our 'keyness measures' (Marchi, Taylor, 2018) (two-by-two frequencies of
words within a sample) indicate that while NATO's official documents are
more general with regard to its strategic word choices, NATO's tweets
are overwhelmingly focused on 'disinformation', 'propaganda' and 'fake
news' terms within the context of Russia ('pro-Kremlin', 'Russian' and
'Kremlin' designations).

4 Unsupervised Structural Topic Model Results

For the structural topic models, we used the stm package for R,
developed by Molly Roberts, Brandon Stewart and Dustin Tingley (Roberts
et al., 2019). Stm was developed as part of its developers quest to come
up with a methodological tool that would allow them to generate causal
inferences from text data. By measuring document-level covariate
measures, it introduces a new form of qualitative inference and within

**\[Omit Table 3\]**

**\[Omit Figure 4\]**

**\[Omit Figure 5\]**

text estimation algorithms for better topic correlations. This
ultimately helps us generate more accurate topic associations and themes
within complex, lengthy documents.

Our unsupervised machine learning tests within NATO documents and tweets
containing disinformationrelated trigger words yielded 50 topic models
with an optimum combination of semantic coherence and heldout values.
Out of these 50 models, our algorithm found that 10 of them had greater
higher semantic salience and thus, had a statistically higher likelihood
of forming a coherent 'topic'. Since not all word combination
likelihoods imply a theme, K-means clustering is required to measure
co-occurrence likelihood of words that make of a topic, in relation to
the statistical significance of other topics (Roberts et al., 2014; Wang
et al., 2011). These are the topics classified and numbered by our stm
algorithm as 1, 4, 7, 9, 14, 16, 23, 35, 39, 47

Topic 1 demonstrates the over-reliance on the term 'disinformation' as
the dominant discursive anchor for NATO documents, mostly correlating
with keywords associated with its spread, the role of fact-checking and
misinformation, which is a less-used term. Topic 16 demonstrates that
the term 'Russian' is highly correlated with 'fake' and 'news' terms,
within the context of info(rmation)\_war(fare), as well as 'troll'. The
second most salient model is Topic 23, which builds around the keyword
'propaganda'. This model correlates most significantly with the n-gram
clusterings: 'strateg\_', 'fact', 'truth' and 'counter', suggesting that
such emphasis is generally made within the context of combating external
efforts of propaganda. Third

**\[Omit Figure 6\]**

most salient Topic Model is 4, built around Russia, and the n-grams
'Ukrain\_', 'hybrid_war', 'Putin', and 'Moscow'. At least within the
context of Russian military involvement in Crimea and Donbass, NATO has
largely relied on the term 'hybrid warfare', instead of
'disinformation', or 'misinformation', suggesting that it doesn't
consider this military entanglement within the context of
'disinformation'.

To understand NATO's most active institution that deals with
disinformation defense, Topic 35 is instructive. There, the keyword
'disinformation' correlates with STRATCOMCOE (NATO Strategic
Communications Centre of Excellence in Riga, Latvia), and RigaStratCom
revealing NATO's frontier defense mechanism of choice in issues related
to disinformation. This is in line with Topic 30, where geographies
correlated with our 'disinformation' keyword cluster reveals 'europ\_',
'baltic', 'german\_', 'danger' and 'prepar\_', hinting at NATO's
perceived geographic vulnerability against disinformation attempts. A
secondary vulnerability cluster emerges in Topic 49, where 'lithuania',
'estonia', 'japan', 'poland', and 'baltic' designations correlate with
'target' and 'defens\_' n-grams (Damashek, 1995) 1 . In Topic 14, we
discover the emergence of COVID-related disinformation issues, although
the correlated terms are not yet sufficient to infer a political trend
of preference.

Longitudinal topic frequency analysis of Topic 1 shows that the keyword
'disinformation' indeed enters into the NATO lexicon after the Russian
military involvement in Ukraine. However, we observe a clear

**\[Omit Figure 7\]**

difference between NATO official texts (web) that don't prefer this
term, versus NATO tweets that overwhelmingly rely on it. The peak in
early 2014 is followed by a second peak after late-2016, possibly owing
to the US elections, reaching its all-time peak in 2020, predictably due
to COVID-related concerns. Topic 4 demonstrates how Russian involvement
in Ukraine, as well as the 'hybrid war' narrative becomes less popular
over time. Despite its significant salience in NATO tweets and a slight
reference in its documents in 2014, these references largely disappear
from NATO's discursive attention zone by 2016.

Tendency to pinpoint Russia in statements containing 'fake news',
'troll' and 'information warfare' keywords is once again clearest in
tweets compared to official statements, as seen in Topic 16. This
tendency peaks once during Russian military operation in Ukraine, for a
second time around the US elections in 2016, gradually disappearing from
NATO's Twitter focus gradually after 2017 with a brief third peak around
the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, UK in March
2018. Same goes for Topic 23, which focuses on terms correlated with
'propaganda'. It peaks with the Russian involvement in Ukraine, marking
a second brief peak around the US elections in 2016 and a third peak
around the Skripal poisoning incident in 2018, later disappearing from
NATO lexicon. NATO's reference to the Baltics and Germany as potential
vulnerabilities against disinformation and hybrid war, Topic 30 produces
a more varied picture. Here, we observe a significant and comparable
activity within NATO tweets and official documents alike. Both NATO
tweets and official documents follow similar curves around the same
periods (Ukraine war, US elections in 2016, Skripal poisoning and COVID
onset in March 2020), suggesting that such geographic vulnerabilities
aren't new, and carry on significant strategic baggage from the past.
Indeed, as Topics 47 and 49 also demonstrates, concerns and
vulnerabilities around Canada, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland and the Baltic
states are emphasized continuously both in NATO official documents and
in tweets.

To sum up, [NATO's discourse on **disinformation** presents a
**discursive continuity** and is]{.underline} broadly [in line
with]{.underline} its [securitization]{.underline} preferences [prior
to]{.underline} the [popularization of]{.underline} the terms '[**fake
news**' or '**information operations**]{.underline}'. By leveraging a
buzzword that has mainstream popularity, [NATO's discursive efforts
refocus the alliance's]{.underline} strategic [agenda back on
**Russia**]{.underline}, and semantically clusters these securitization
moves on existing competition areas with Moscow. Since securitization is
the process by which regular events, actors and phenomena are elevated
into a policy frame that requires special measures, NATO's
disinformation discourse directly fits into the theoretical spectrum.
NATO's 2018 Brussels Summit Declaration and the 2019 London Declaration
both prioritized disinformation as a major, strategic-level alliance
threat and combating information warfare have been integrated into NATO
military exercises since 2017. NATO has been running wargames that focus
on coordinated, Russian-origin disinformation campaigns against NATO
battlegroups in Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland and has been investing in
the establishment of new digital countermeasure labs (NATO, 2020). In
other words, [as a successful **securitization** effort, disinformation
has been receiving ample **attention**, **resources** and
cohesion-building initiatives within]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline}
framework. As part of this strategy, [NATO's **securitization** efforts
have a clear securitizing **agent** (**alliance**),]{.underline}
[**existential threat** (**Russian**]{.underline}-origin [**information
warfare**), a referent object (**alliance cohesion**, **electoral
integrity**]{.underline}) [and an **audience**]{.underline}
(international public opinion), along with new doctrinal changes and
investment schemees.

5 Discussion and Conclusion

Our analysis has shown that NATO has developed two
disinformation-related communication strategies for two outlets: a more
up-to-date and faster-developing threat discourse for its Twitter
presence, and a more traditional, slow-moving threat presence visible in
its official documents. This is particularly interesting and acutely
visible in more 20th century military topics like command and control
cohesion, missile defense, air defense architecture, naval defense,
satellites and military intelligence-related topics that are more
frequently mentioned in official documents, and much less referenced on
Twitter. However, the overwhelming majority of disinformation,
misinformation, hybrid war, information warfare and fake news-related
communication topics are securitized on Twitter. This shows the
emergence of two NATO discourses: one for its official documents, and
one for its social media presence and messaging.

The advent of digital communication technologies and social media has
been significant for the evolution of securitization. Since
securitization entails production and dissemination of insecurity frames
through discursive networks, a more dynamic, interconnected information
ecosystem is more conducive for collective meaning-making. On social
media, the formation of insecurity processes are more rapid and
interactive, and are able to influence and alter traditional, boring
securitizing acts of elites. To that end, media outlets like Twitter
provide a more interactive and fast-paced securitizing environment where
elites and non-elites can set the security agenda and mobilize masses.
The most clear expression of this novel medium, as demonstrated in our
results, is that NATO's Twitter securitization efforts change much
faster, and spread more widely than traditional outlets like official
speeches, texts and reports.

This could be interpreted in two ways: first, that NATO may prefer
securitizing disinformation exclusively on Twitter, since such threats
are generally more visible and debated on social media platforms. The
second interpretation is that NATO's official statements and documents
could largely be focusing on macrolevel doctrinal issues that pose a
direct military security threat to its members, rather than
disinformation, which is a nuisance, but poses no direct military
threat. Since disinformation is being discussed in contemporary policy
debates within the context of electoral integrity and social
polarization, their actual military relevance may be less relevant to be
taken into account in formal NATO documents. In either case, [our study
of the **NATO lexicon** demonstrated]{.underline} that
[disinformation]{.underline} and related terms [are constructed
as]{.underline} uniquely [**'Russian' nuisances**. This isn't
**surprising** since]{.underline} most of [these terms]{.underline} - at
least their digital interpretations - have [entered the NATO lexicon
after]{.underline} the [Russian]{.underline} military [involvement
in]{.underline} eastern Ukraine and [Crimea]{.underline}. However, since
then, [Russia remained the **only country** against which
**NATO**]{.underline} has [constructed]{.underline} its
[**disinformation** narratives, indicating]{.underline} that [Russia is
NATO's **sole disinformation** concern. Although]{.underline} very
recently [China]{.underline} has [emerged as a **runner-up
country**]{.underline} within the context of COVID-related
disinformation concerns[, Russia is]{.underline} largely [the **main
threat** in **NATO's lexicon**. This could be **counterproductive** to
long-term NATO **efforts** to combat **disinformation**, given
the]{.underline} global [prevalence of **fake news** and **information
meddling**]{.underline}. While Russian disinformation efforts are
observably valid, [cornering a **universal problem** like disinformation
into the limited space of **NATO's interactions** with a **single
country** may lead to **conceptual contraction**. This]{.underline} in
turn, [may **prevent NATO** from mobilizing]{.underline} full [alliance
resources against **disinformation**, defined as a
**global**]{.underline} and universal **[problem]{.underline}**.

Overall, our analysis has shown that [NATO]{.underline} still [defines
its **security identity** against **Russia**,]{.underline} [and there
isn't a significant shift in NATO's securitization dynamics since the
**Cold War**]{.underline}, evidenced by our comparative analysis of
older and newer NATO texts. Although Chinese disinformation attempts
have also begun to enter into NATO threat language, NATO's primary
discursive security identity continues to develop against and around
Russia. This is most evident in our longitudinal analysis or pre- and
post-2014 documents that prioritize Russia as a threat alike, implying
that it is not really disinformation or fake news agenda that is
rendering Russia a threat for NATO. [This suggests]{.underline} the
hypothesis that [even if **technologies change**, **NATO Russia**
rivalry will remain **securitized** the **same way**]{.underline}. In
other words, [contemporary **disinformation**]{.underline} and fake news
agenda [is a continuation of the **same NATO-Russia
rivalry**]{.underline} -- at least in discursive form -- [through
**newer mediums**]{.underline}.

#### The aff's frenetic obsession with stabilizing the Middle East is rooted in an unstable Western identity seeking a false sense of coherence\-\--their impacts are political constructs that exemplify the West's inability to recognize the Arab world as anything but violent\-\--rejecting yes/no policy questions in favor of rethinking our understanding of the Middle East is the only way to avoid serial policy failure

[Western]{.underline} media and [[think-tanks]{.underline}]{.mark} [have
[long presented a **mistaken**]{.mark}]{.underline} and divisive
**[[understanding of Arab]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- and other --
[**[societies]{.underline}**. [There is a discrepancy between
the]{.underline} ]{.mark}[actual [situation and **indicators**-**driven
understanding.**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Entire]{.mark} Arab [societies
are]{.mark} deconstructed and **[reduced into simple data, which is
filtered]{.mark}, classified and juggled**]{.underline} [to fit [into
**precise** ]{.mark}**criteria and [clear]{.mark}-cut
[conclusions]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Public opinions and entire
[[policies are]{.mark} then [formed]{.mark}]{.underline} or formulated
[based [on these]{.mark} conclusions]{.underline}.

**[[The problem]{.underline}]{.mark}** does not **[[lie
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** academic practices, per se, but rather **[[the
objective]{.mark}-specific understanding [that]{.mark} many in [the west
have]{.mark}]{.underline}** towards the Middle East. Most
Washington-based [[think tanks]{.underline}]{.mark} -- regardless of
their political leanings -- tend to [[study]{.mark} distant
[societies]{.mark}]{.underline} only [[for the sake of
**producing**]{.mark}]{.underline} definite **[[answers]{.mark} and
recommendations]{.underline}**. [However, [providing a]{.mark}n
all-encompassing [depiction of a society]{.mark}]{.underline} like
Yemen's -- [[whose internal dynamics and **complexity**]{.mark}
necessarily [differs]{.mark} from any [other's]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline} -- [[would be]{.mark} most [unhelpful]{.mark} for
those eager [to design policies]{.mark} and short-term strategies on the
go.]{.underline}

[[Arab revolutions]{.mark} continue to [tear down]{.mark}]{.underline}
archaic beliefs and [[misguided understandings,]{.underline}
[challenging]{.underline}]{.mark} [the wild [theories around Arab
peoples]{.mark} and their supposed wrangling between secularism and
Islamism.]{.underline} [[Despite]{.mark} all of [this, the
**self-seeking objectifying**]{.mark} of Arabs [continues in western
media]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Under the all-inclusive title, "The Arab World: The Awakening", [an
article]{.underline} in Economist Magazine (Feb 17) [attempted to
describe the upheaval]{.underline} currently underway throughout the
Arab world. [[Interspersed with]{.mark} such predictable [terms as
'extremists', 'Islamists', 'strongmen']{.mark} and so on,]{.underline}
**[the [inane analysis made way for]{.mark} equally [silly
conclusions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The article, for example, suggested
that the West's decision to accommodate dictatorial regimes in the
Middle East was motivated by a mix of despair and altruism: "The West
has surrendered to this (Arab) despair too, assuming that only the
strongmen could hold back the extremists."

[While words such 'extremists', 'fundamentalists' and 'terrorists' may
have their own special ring to western audiences, they
could]{.underline} well [mean something entirely different]{.underline}
-- if anything at all -- [to Arabs]{.underline}. [[Listening
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Arab]{.mark}]{.underline} media's
[[coverage]{.mark} of]{.underline} ongoing [revolutions, **[one may not
even encounter]{.mark} any of [the above
terminologies]{.mark}.**]{.underline} **At times, [[they can be]{.mark}
entirely [irrelevant in]{.mark} terms of [understanding]{.mark} the
momentous happenings]{.underline} underway [throughout [the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}**

The Libyan rebellion is another example to note here. Revolution and war
in Libya have ignited a heated debate among Arab intellectuals,
pertaining to the use of violence and foreign intervention -- although
barely in support of the Libyan regime. However, for the New York Times,
the coverage of the story is often slated and removed from current
reality in Libya. The article "Exiled Islamists Watch Rebellion Unfold
at Home," (NYT, July 18) attempted to answer a nagging question
concerning the relationship between Islamists and the Libyan rebels.
This question is relevant only to western governments. Although the
group examined -- the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group -- has long been
dismantled, its alleged former ties with al-Qaeda continue to concern
many in the west. While for Libyans, "the men are seen not as an alien,
pernicious force but as patriots," the article claims that many in the
West "are trying to assess their influence and any lingering links to Al
Qaeda."

[[Arab revolutions are]{.mark} attempting to examine larger issues that
have tremendous impact on all aspects of life. They are actively
[confronting the]{.mark} suffering caused at the hands of local
[dictators supported by Western]{.mark}]{.underline} and other foreign
[[governments]{.underline}. **[Western]{.underline}**]{.mark} media and
**[[intellectuals]{.mark}, however, continue to [seek]{.mark} only [easy
answers to intricate]{.mark}, multi-faceted [questions. In doing so,
they follow the]{.mark} path of the [same superficial]{.mark},
stereotypical and predictable [discourse.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[While
Arab societies discuss democracy]{.mark},]{.underline} freedom and
social justice, [[Western writers]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to
[[follow the imagined paths of al-Qaeda,]{.mark} Islamists, [moderates
and extremists]{.mark}.]{.underline} In all of this, **[they are
embarking [on]{.mark} yet [another futile hunt,]{.mark} a hunt [that
will yield no]{.mark} concrete [answers, and more misguided

## Impact

### Impact\-\--Endless War

#### Endless war

International Politics from Aberystwyth University, 2018, "Forgetting
ISIS: enmity, drive and repetition in security discourse," Critical
Studies on Security, Vol. 6, No.1, p. 85-86

[[Security never seems to make]{.mark} any [progress]{.mark}. Despite
military investments, security reviews and ever more powerful
technological surveillance]{.underline}, European and North [American
[populations are]{.mark} **continually [represented as
unsafe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The most [powerful states]{.mark} in the
world]{.underline}, enjoying historically unprecedented levels of
health, prosperity and stability, [[are]{.mark} simultaneously the most
**[hysterically possessed by]{.mark} security-related
[fear]{.mark}s**]{.underline}. The compulsion to experience the self as
insecure, despite evidence to the contrary, is the starting point for
this paper. ¶ Much has been written about political anxiety in the
fields of political theory and sociology. Corey Robin has explored the
developing permutations of fear in Western philosophical thought as an
operational concept (Robin 2004); Frank Furedi has explored how the
[**social alienation** and **declining community ties** associated with
contemporary **neoliberalism** have led to cultures of
insecurity]{.underline} (Furedi 2002), and Anthony Giddens and Ulrich
Beck have both written about the transformation of risk and anxiety in
an age where technology produces its own, sometimes existential, dangers
(Beck 1992; Giddens 1990). Fear and risk are prominent topics on
sociological and philosophical landscapes.¶ Not wanting to be left
behind, [international relations has also produced substantial
literatures on the risk discourses and anxieties which dominate
contemporary political life]{.underline}. Much of this research was
initially located within the Copenhagen School of securitisation theory,
which analysed the construction of threat by political elites and the
centrality of speech acts to processes of securitisation (Buzan, Wæver,
and De Wilde 1998; Hansen 2012a; McDonald 2008). [[The
function]{.mark}ality [of securitisation is]{.mark} here understood in
terms of identity]{.underline}: **[identifying and [invoking an external
threat]{.mark} serves [to]{.mark} performatively [constitute the
nation]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Jackson 2005; McCrisken 2003).¶ In the
wake of securitisation theory, European international relations
developed a poststructuralist critique of Beck's 'Risk Society' thesis.
In their rethinking of risk, Claudia Aradau and Rens Van Munster
critiqued Beck's macro-sociological assumptions that risks exist
independently in the world from the governmental technologies which
invoke them (Aradau and Van Munster 2007). [The incalculability of
contemporary risks does not make them ungovernable]{.underline}, as Beck
suggests; [rather governance structures have shifted to incorporate the
unpredictability of certain dangers into precautionary risk
management.]{.underline} **[[Incalculability becomes the modality of
security]{.underline}]{.mark}**.1 Poststructuralist International
Relations has found fertile terrain in the idea of risks and their
governance. Pushing this research beyond its focus on the security
sector, Emmy Eklundh, Andreja Zevnik and Emmanuel Pierre-Guittet have
explored the logics of anxiety at play in austerity politics and
security governance, and the anxious and resistant subjectivities
produced therein (Eklundh, Zevnik, and Pierre-Guittet 2017).¶ But what
does it mean to centralise anxiety, fear and risk in Western political
and sociological thought at a time of relative geopolitical stability
and wealth? In his own take on the politics of anxiety, Mark Neocleous
(2000) tackled the proliferation of (in)security and risk discourse in
sociology and international relations, arguing that [the acceleration of
(in) securitisation reflects the policing of civil society to protect
bourgeois property and status. The articulation of pollution, terrorism
and migration as security threats depoliticises them; it silences the
social and political creation of these issues, **[enabling]{.mark}
governing [structures to pursue technocratic
solutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[which efface the]{.mark} real
[genesis]{.mark} [of threats]{.mark}]{.underline}: **[capital
accumulation]{.underline}**.¶ It is important to note that the arguments
made by Neocleous, poststructuralist scholars of risk and securitisation
theorists share more in common than their focus on political anxiety.
[[They]{.mark} all also [describe ambivalence]{.mark} within security
practices [towards the threat]{.mark} object. While [politicians
promise]{.mark} that [**destroying the enemy** will bring]{.mark} about
resolution and **ontological [stability]{.mark}**, IR literatures show
that [frames of enmity enable]{.mark} the pursuit of [other
goals:]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[biopolitical governance]{.underline}**,
**[identity consolidation]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[furtherance of **capital accumulation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [There is
a gap between security and its threat object]{.underline}. [[The
threat]{.mark} object [is made hypersignificant in]{.mark} political
[discourse, but]{.mark} it is [simultaneously **treated ambivalently**
and]{.mark} can be **[replaced at will]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [New
objects wait in the wings as **potential vessels for
enmity**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Everything, for example, has now become possible. But what [[human being
seems]{.mark} most [impelled]{.mark} to do with the power of its actions
is [to turn itself into a]{.mark} species]{.underline}; not merely an
animal species, nor even a species of currency or consumption (which
amount to the same thing), but [a **mere [species of
calculation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [For [only by reducing]{.mark}
itself [to an index]{.mark} of calculation [does it seem capable of
constructing]{.mark} that political [arithmetic by which it can
secure]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}**
globalised [Western thought insists upon, and which a world made
increasingly unpredictable by the very way human being acts into it now
seems to **require**]{.underline}. Yet, [[the]{.mark} very [rage for
calculability]{.mark} which securing security incites [is]{.mark}
precisely also [what **reduces**]{.mark} **human
[freedom]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [inducing]{.underline}]{.mark} [either
[**despair** or the **surrender** of **what is
human**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to the de-humanising calculative logic of
what seems to be **necessary to secure security**]{.underline}. I think,
then, that Hannah [[Arendt]{.mark} was right when she [saw]{.mark} late
modern [humankind caught in a]{.mark} **dangerous [world-destroying
cleft]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[between]{.mark} a [belief that everything
is possible and]{.mark} a [willingness to surrender]{.mark} itself to
so-called laws of necessity]{.underline} (calculability itself) [which
would make everything possible. That it was]{.underline}, in short,
[[characterised by]{.mark} a combination of [reckless omnipotence
and]{.mark} reckless [despair]{.mark}]{.underline}. But I also think
that things have gone one stage further---[the surrender to the
necessity of realising everything that is possible]{.underline}---and
[that this found its paradigmatic expression,]{.underline} for example,
in the deterrent security policies of the Cold War; where everything up
to and including self-immolation [not only became possible but actually
necessary in the interests of]{.underline} (inter)national [security.
This logic persists in the **metaphysical core** of modern
politics]{.underline}---the axioms of interState security relations,
popularised, for example, through strategic discourse--- [even if the
details have changed]{.underline}.

### Impact\-\--AT: Case Outweighs

#### The traditional debate impulse to rely on body counts for impact calc is an [example]{.underline} of our impact\-\--it relies on the continual imagination of external threats to the social order and teaches students to be constantly [searching]{.underline} for the best way to describe those threats, [instead]{.underline} of examining the structural conditions that enable violence. This enables a system of governance that elides the [endless war]{.underline} present in incarceration, global policing, and more by insisting on narrow chains of causality and the most catastrophic impacts possible

Kevin **McDonald 13**, Professor and Director of the Centre for Cultural
Diversity and Wellbeing at Victoria University, *Our Violent World:

Among the most significant Of these changes are transformations in forms
Of social and political violence, the kinds Of violence recently
described by the philosopher Charles Taylor as \'categorial\', directed
towards people whom the protagonists do not personally know (2011).
Often such violence is contrasted to the violence that takes place
within personal relationships, but as we will see as this book develops,
this distinction is not as clear as it once may have been. The chapters
that follow attempt to explore a con- text that has become increasingly
evident, as [[violence that once appeared]{.mark} to be
[\'contained\']{.mark}]{.underline} by key dimensions of modern society
[[is]{.mark} now much more fluid, increasingly part of the flows [making
up a global world]{.mark}]{.underline} (Urry 2005). But such violence is
not a \'thing\' or an object. It is a form of agency, an embodied
relationship and human experience. As such, [it is a critical lens
through which to explore]{.underline} wider [transformations of social
life]{.underline}. On the Other hand, [[to separate violence from such
transformations **profoundly limits our capacity to**]{.mark}
**understand, and [respond to]{.mark}**, one of the most [urgent
questions]{.mark} shaping the twenty-first century.]{.underline} ¶ The
Surveillance Society ¶ [Most of us are aware of changing]{.underline}
forms or potentials of [violence through the growth of security and
surveillance (]{.underline}Crelinsten 2009). Some developments are
obvious, such as airport security. Others are less so, [such as passport
tracking systems, **internment camps**, control orders and detention
without trial, or erosion of the distinction between immigration policy
and security policy]{.underline} (Connolly 2005: 54). Some receive
extensive debate in the press and social media, while Other developments
are less discussed. Over recent years, for example, states as different
as Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United States have been engaged in
the construction Of thousands Of kilometres Of walls along national bor-
ders, a development that the political scientist Wendy Brown calls
\'walling\', something she contends is driven by \'waning sovereignty\'
(2010). [Global [military expenditure]{.mark}]{.underline}, which had
declined in the years following the end of the Cold War in 1989,
[[expanded rapidly]{.mark} over the first decade of the new
century]{.underline}, increasing by some 49 per cent to reach US\$1.53
tril- lion in 2009 (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
2011). New types of public surveillance involve pervasive but ambiguous
categories Of \'pre-crime\' as public policy seeks to identify groups
and individuals \'at risk\' of committing criminal acts (Zedner 2007).
[The changing role of the criminal justice system has become evident in
[the relentless increase in the]{.mark} number of people
[imprisoned]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}, a figure that reached
some 10.65 million in 2009 (Walmsley 2010). ¶ Political theorists in
particular have been aware of the ways [[these]{.mark} transformations
[**\'resonate\'**, **mutually amplifying each
other**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Connolly 2005: 54). Brian Massumi (2007)
argues that [we are witnessing the emergence of a new type of governance
in complex societies]{.underline}, one shaped by a shift from a model Of
prevention, which operates in an \'objectively knowable world\', to a
model of pre-emption, which involves the attempt to wield power in a
world based on uncertainty. Brad [Evans]{.underline} (2010) [points to
the rise of **[\'consequentialist ethics\']{.mark}**]{.underline}
involved in this development, [[where]{.underline}]{.mark} forms of
moral [[judgement]{.mark} framed in terms of \'right\' and \'wrong\'
[are]{.mark} becoming [**redefined as calculations** to determine
**whether a situation is**]{.mark} **to be judged [better or worse as a
result of a course of action]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These are not minor
trans- formations. The OECD argues that \'security\' has become a major
area Of economic activity, a driver Of modern economies (OECD 2004),
while the sociologist David Lyon traces the contours of a surveillance
society increasingly based on digital technologies (Lyon 2004). The
political philosopher William Connolly argues that [[this]{.mark} new
social and political model [involves]{.mark} an **increasing
[mobilization of the population against \'unspecified
enemies\']{.mark}**]{.underline} (2005: 54). ¶ The Blurring of War and
Peace ¶ One Way to think about this transformation is in terms Of a
changing relationship between peace and war. The historical sociologist
Charles Tilly argues that the emergence Of [modern
societies]{.underline} from the seventeenth century to the Second World
War Saw violence moving in two directions: increasingly deadly
inter-state confrontations and increasingly peaceful domestic societies,
evident in the disarming Of populations and the rise Of peaceful forms
Of protest and conflict (Tilly 2002, 2003). This constituted [an
increasingly clear [separation between]{.mark} zones of [war and]{.mark}
zones of [peace]{.mark}]{.underline}, a separation that for the
philosopher Immanuel Kant constituted the very basis Of modern society
(Kleingold 2006: ix). [This account]{.underline} of the birth Of
modernity [locates violence beyond the borders of increasingly peaceful
societies, and]{.underline} to a significant extent [[has
established]{.mark} itself as [a]{.mark} **[structure of thought
preventing any]{.mark} significant [exploration]{.mark}** [of the
violence]{.mark} at the heart of modern societies, in particular the
violence present [in **colonial expansion**]{.mark}]{.underline}, or in
the extent of atrocities and extreme violence undertaken by the
colonizers in the process Of decolonization (Bennett 2011). [[Within
this]{.mark} modern self-[understanding]{.mark},]{.underline} [the
capacity for extreme [**violence has always been associated with \'the
Other** with modern society]{.mark}, by definition, understood as
[being]{.mark} inherently [peaceful]{.mark}.]{.underline} ¶ The
securitization we have referred to above signals two related
transformations: [the separation between war and peace is becoming less
and less clear]{.underline}, while the state\'s monopoly of violence is
becoming less and less certain. [Rather than war being an external
event]{.underline}, the cultural geographer Nigel Thrift argues that
contemporary, [globalizing [societies have entered an \'era of
**permanent**]{.mark} **and pervasive [war]{.mark}**\']{.underline}
(2011: 11), [with war no longer understood as taking place beyond
borders, but across all areas of social life]{.underline}. This shift
seems particularly evident when we 100k at urban design, where we
encounter not simply the increasing integration of blast proofing and
other defensive systems into buildings, but [the actual militarization
of urban space]{.underline}, evident in particular in contemporary
military theory where older conceptions of \'battlefield\' are giving
way to new models of \'battle space\' (see Graham 2012) where the space
of warfare [becomes \'cotermi- nus with the space of civil society
itself\']{.underline} (Dillon and Reid 2009: 128). This pattern is
evident in the extent that conceptions of urban security devel- oped in
a warzone such as post-2003 Baghdad have established themselves as
paradigms for policing and security in the cities Of North American and
Europe (Graham 2010). ¶ [War, from this perspective, rather than being
an activity beyond the borders Of modern society, becomes instead **a
lens with which to conceive**]{.underline} [of the core organization of
such societies.]{.underline} The rise of war as a lens to frame social
life has been particularly evident in military theory. William Lind, for
example, argues that the world has entered an age of \'fourth generation
war\', characterized by the loss Of the state\'s monopoly over the
exercise Of War. Today states find themselves at war with non-state
opponents, wars he argues that states are losing. Writing in a respected
journal, Lind argues \'invasion by immigration can be at least as
dangerous as invasion by a state army\' (2004: 14). We do not need to
embrace this type Of argument to rec- ognize that the twenty-first
century has been shaped by an awareness of a new vulnerability.

the contradictory judgement that actions can be both right and wrong,
and to see how this judgement could be embodied in public policy or
interpreted in any politically intelligible fashion. Walzer endorses a
utilitarian or consequentialist morality as necessary and right in
politics. In this case, acknowledging the wrong that is done cannot have
any moral significance if morality is ultimately overridden by utility
considerations. Ignatieff, like Walzer, reJects what he calls \'moral
perfectionism which holds that states should never have tmck with
dubious moral means\'. 7 However, he dis-tinguishes his position from a
\'morality of consequences\', and argues that some rules should never be
broken. He tries to folge a middle way between the priority given to
rights or to security, but [he does not tell us how \'lesser evil\'
claims are made, and [he has an unreasonable]{.mark} and naive [faith
in]{.mark} democratic decisionmaking procedures and [safeguards to
ensure that leaders do not **exaggerate** ]{.mark}**such
[claims]{.mark}**]{.underline} or abuse their powels.
[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} the context of [[a]{.mark} political
[environment which **prioritizes security** and is **hostile to
moderation**]{.mark}, **it is hard to see how [\'lesser evil\' arguments
will]{.mark} not be used to [justify overriding]{.mark} any
[rules]{.mark}** if necessary]{.underline}. Significantly, [arguments in
favour of torturing terrorist suspects have used precisely this \'lesser
evil\' argument.]{.underline} The Bush administration constructed a
necessity self-defence justification so that interrogators could violate
the prohibition on torture if they believed it necessary as a lesser
evil to prevent a direct or imminent threat to the US and Its citizens.
¶ Il September and supreme emergency ¶ [[Accepting]{.mark} the necessity
of \'dirty hands\' in politics and [\'lesser evil\' arguments **lends
support to the architects of the war on terror**]{.mark}
who]{.underline} in the aftermath of Il September [constructed a
narrative framework that presented the ongoing threat as a supreme
emergency in order to justify extraordinary measures]{.underline}. 39
The terrorist threat was portrayed as an unprecedented, catastrophic,
and existential one, as a challenge to our values, to our way of life,
to civilization itself. [The portrayal of the scale]{.underline} and
nature [of the threat and the [demonization]{.mark} of the
enemy]{.underline} as evil and irrational [[**conjure up fears of a
uniquely dangerous threat** so that **political impertives** **trump**
all other]{.mark}]{.underline} legal and [moral
[considerations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The state of emergency serves to
justify the suspension of normal politics as well as the resort to any
means including pre-emptive wars, the violation of the basic human
rights of terrorist suspects, and the narrowing of civil liberties and
basic freedoms. ¶ Those who reject this narrative and the resulting
ethics of emergency challenge the assumption that the terrorist threats
are exceptional and believe that the declara- tion of the war on terror
was a disproportionate response to an exaggerated threat. None of the
terrorist attacks in the US (2001 ), Bali (2002), Madrid (2004), London
(2005) or Mumbai (2008) literally threatened the life of the nation or
freedom or democracy, still less \'civilization\'. Statistically, the
actual risks to individuals from terrorism should not be exaggerated. 40
The eleventh of September was not an exceptional event understood in
terms of the number of people who died, in comparison to Rwanda in 1994
or the Democratic Republic of Congo since 1998. Approximately [3000
people died in the US terrorist attack, but]{.underline} Richard Jackson
argues [[\'on September 11]{.mark}, 2001 itself, an estimated [**30,000
children died** of hunger]{.mark} and preventable diseases across the
developing world --- [as they do every day]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this
sense, **[[the myth of exceptional suffering
represents]{.underline}]{.mark}** something of [**[an obfuscation of
global realities]{.underline}**\']{.mark} .4

### Alt\-\--General Solvency/AT: Apolitical

#### Critique has political effects\-\--security is produced through [mundane practices]{.underline} and [scholarly frames]{.underline}, which means making visible the practices of security can [rupture]{.underline} their naturalization

Claudia **Aradau 15**, Department of War Studies at King\'s College
London, Jef Huysmans**,** Andrew Neal and Nadine Voelkner INTRODUCING
CRITICAL SECURITY METHODS, in *Critical Security Methods,* 13-4

[The 'political life of methods' draws attention to the role that
methods can play in challenging and changing dominant productions of
(in)]{.underline}security. [[Methods]{.underline}]{.mark} do not just
carry substantive assumptions about the world; they also [[have effects
for social and political life]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This demands that
critical security methods]{.underline} consider not only the
'situated-ness' and limits of knowledge and the contestations
surrounding methods, but also [include]{.underline} a [sensitivity
to]{.underline} potentially subjugated, [silenced or marginalized
practices and knowledges]{.underline}. Unease with scientificity and the
dominance it entails upon other forms of knowledge has often surfaced in
critical approaches. For example, feminist scholars have rightly pointed
out that scientific knowledge entails its own forms of masculine
domination (Tickner 2006; Sylvester 1994). [They have led a call for a
methodological privileging of subordinated positions, in which knowledge
about the world can be formulated from the position of those who are
politically as well as epistemologically marginalized.]{.underline} As
such, feminism has been most outspoken about developing knowledge that
is grounded in the lifeworld of women who are often absent from security
knowledge (Enloe 2007; Haraway 1988). Poststructuralist approaches
similarly experimented with methods of intertextuality and the breaking
down of disciplinary distinctions between genres of text and knowledge
to demonstrate how [**[worlds are]{.mark} not simply created by
political and security systems and elites but are also [brought into
being in mundane practices]{.mark} that are [often seen as
insignificant]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the security studies field, such
as sports, travel writing, diaries, popular TV series and so on (see
e.g., Lisle 2013; Rowley and Weldes 2012; Kiersey and Neumann 2013;
Derian and Shapiro 1989). Their methods also made visible how
[instituted [scholarly methods]{.mark} tend to **[reproduce]{.mark}
dominant [power relations and the]{.mark} legitimating [frameworks that
sustain them]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Disrupting the latter by
introducing genre-crossing methods aimed at creating the possibility for
subjugated knowledge and practice to gain presence in the scholarly
field of security knowledge.

[[The political life of methods]{.mark} thus [refers to **reflexivity**
about]{.mark} the power relations and **[habitus that methods
produce]{.mark} and sustain**.]{.underline} [[This means proactively
positioning oneself]{.underline}]{.mark} through the development of
methods so as [[to **challenge**]{.mark}]{.underline} familiar and
[**[instituted processes of]{.mark} validation of [what matters for
security]{.mark}** practice and studies.]{.underline} [A key
question]{.underline} for critical scholars, in spite of their
IR/security studies heritage, [is what it means to start not here in
'the international' but elsewhere.]{.underline} Feminist, Marxist, and
postcolonial approaches share this mobilizing of a distinct positioning,
as does the use of popular culture and the recent experimenting with
autoethnographic methods to understand international politics. For
critical security scholars [this can mean starting with situated
practices of struggle rather than security]{.underline} (see Chapter 6).
For example, [**[developing critica]{.mark}l mapping [methods]{.mark}**
[when analysing]{.mark} geopolitical [security]{.mark}
practice]{.underline} or the reification of territoriality through
border control regimes often [[work by making visible]{.mark} the
victims and [injustices produced by]{.mark} security
[practices]{.mark}]{.underline} (Chapter 2). Or, it can require that
critical security scholars undo security as an object and experiment
with methods that analyse security practices as more dispersed and
possibly not primarily intelligible as 'security' (see Chapter 6).
Another way of taking a critical position through method is to
experiment with collaboration in order to challenge the limits of
individualizing forms of knowledge production in scholarly fields
organized through new management practices (Chapter 8).

[[Critical]{.mark} security [methods are]{.mark}]{.underline} thus also
[[political because of their **rupturing effects**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(see Aradau and Huysmans 2013). [This may not mean 'changing the world'
in the way that Marx]{.underline} (1994) [called on philosophers to
do]{.underline} ([although it might]{.underline}); [more often, critical
methods mean changing worlds in local and immediate terms.]{.underline}
When we practise methods, we talk to selected people, we go to distinct
places, we interact, we are hired, we employ assistants, we buy, we
consume, we introduce ideas, we collaborate, we argue, we produce and we
publish. As security researchers, we interact with those affected by
security practices and those responsible for security practices, and we
interact with other researchers, [creating new forms of knowledge and
new social arrangements]{.underline}. In so doing, [these practices can
introduce turbulence into existing routines, habitus and
practices.]{.underline} Sometimes they might resolve issues and
questions, but they might also make them messier. Sometimes they also
create entirely new issues and questions.

Since Russia's aggression against Ukraine in 2014, ['**hybrid
warfare**']{.underline} (HW), a term most broadly understood as a
combination of military and non-military means of conflict, [has been
elevated to one]{.underline} of the [primary threat]{.underline}s [to
**European security**]{.underline} (Fridman, 2018; Galeotti, 2019).
[While **discussed** and **addressed** by]{.underline} the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (**[NATO]{.underline}**) and the European
Union (EU), [and resonating in]{.underline} particular in central and
[**eastern Europe**, the]{.underline} shape of the [threat
has]{.underline} often [remained **opaque**. What is it **exactly** that
Russians]{.underline} are supposed to [threaten, and **how**? What is it
**precisely** that governments should do in **response**?]{.underline}
Various [experts]{.underline} have provided explanations ranging from
the particularities of Russian military thought, through changing
conditions of war, to the rise of new technologies and proliferation of
social media. Some of them also [highlighted the]{.underline} extremely
[**vague** and **undifferentiated ways** that HW]{.underline}1
[is]{.underline} conceptualised and [spoken about]{.underline} (Fridman,
2018; Johnson, 2018). In this article, [we]{.underline} build upon and
move beyond these studies by [show]{.underline}ing that the [broader HW
discourse]{.underline} in fact [consists of **multiple**]{.underline}
different and even [**contradictory narratives**. While **talking** and
writing about]{.underline} supposedly [the **same thing**, participants
in the **HW debate**]{.underline} often [suggest]{.underline} markedly
[different ideas about]{.underline} the precise nature and target of
[the threat, offer different **responses** and draw upon **different
sources** of **expertise**]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline} variation [poses a **problem**]{.underline} that
deserves to be addressed [for]{.underline} both analytical and
[**normative purposes**. If HW]{.underline} really [is]{.underline} such
[a **threat**, as its adoption by **NATO**]{.underline} and EU,
documented by the creation of a string of new institutions, strategies
and action plans **[suggests]{.underline}** (for overviews, see
Bajarūnas, 2020; Rühle and Roberts, 2019), [we should be interested in
understanding its]{.underline} precise [character to]{.underline} be
able to [craft **well-tailored responses**. **However**]{.underline}, as
we will show[, the **HW label** is pinned **freely** upon
issues]{.underline} ranging [from **military challenges** and
functioning of **democratic institutions**, through **covert
subversion** and **social polarisation**, all the way to **critical
thinking** and **media literacy**]{.underline}. By identifying the key
differences between the main threat constructions, we shed light on what
issues are at stake when we talk about HW. Thereby, [this
article]{.underline} also [makes a **political intervention** by
**denaturalising** the]{.underline} often [unreflected reading of **HW**
as a **singular problem**]{.underline}. [By disentangling the
distinct]{.underline}ive [stories of **causes** and **effects**, we hope
to re**-problematise** the coexistence of very **different ideas** under
the **same headline**]{.underline}. It is often only the label of
'**[hybrid war]{.underline}**' that temporarily holds these different
narratives and knowledges together, as their assumptions may not be
commensurable (see also Ördén, 2019; Rühle, 2019; Szostek, 2020).
Therefore, the very label [needs to be applied with **extreme
cautiousness** as it]{.underline} hardly [speaks about a **coherent
problem**]{.underline}. Put bluntly, [by facing **HW**
without]{.underline} clearly [specifying what it **means**]{.underline}
exactly[, we risk not only **over-securitising** the issue by applying
**security** and **war framing** to]{.underline} issues such as
[**social polarisation** or **media literacy**, but also ending up
tasking our **security apparatuses** with fighting **everything** and
**nothing** at the **same time**.]{.underline}

While we are interested in the general issues of denaturalising HW,
showing the variation within the discourse and pointing out the usually
tacit discrepancies, we examine them through a study of one case:
Czechia. The country is a good example for exploring how such a new
threat is made sense of in the public sphere, as it is considered a
pioneer in responding to HW (Jankowicz, 2020). The notion of HW made a
significant impact on Czech security policies, as it has been included
in key strategic documents and embedded in security and political
institutions. Czechia has also played an outsized role in the European
institutions, acting as a policy entrepreneur on several levels. Prague
hosts the Stratcom Summit, a leading international forum for networking
and discussing HW-related issues. As one of the very first countries,
the Czech government contributed with two officials to the EU's East
StratCom Task Force, which runs the EUvsDisinfo website. The Czech Vice
President of the European Commission, Věra Jourová, now oversees large
parts of the EU's 'hybrid threats' agenda, and Czech European Parliament
members are highly visible in the matter, too. Czech discourse on HW is,
thus, closely entangled with the broader European debate on the issue.
This enables us to draw conclusions about the HW discourse and its
variations relevant beyond our case, offering an important complement to
the pioneering studies on the different articulations of 'fake news'
discourse in Germany (Monsees, 2020) or the conceptualisations of the
'information threat' on the EU level (Ördén, 2019).

We read the HW discourse through a simple question: what exactly is the
nature of the threat and how do we possibly respond to it?
[We]{.underline} answer it by [identify]{.underline}ing [three
narratives that interpret]{.underline} the nature of [HW **differently**
with respect to the **threat**]{.underline}, the threatened object or
value, as well as what the response should be. First, [the **defence
narrative** is concerned with the possibility of a '**real war**'
resulting from **great-power competition**, which it wants to **avert**
by building]{.underline} appropriate [**defence**
capabilities]{.underline}. Second, [the **counterinfluence** narrative
focuses on the **societal** and **value threat** in the form of
**Russian covert action** practiced through **disinformation**
and]{.underline} a network of [**local proxies**, stressing the need to
protect **society** against both **foreign influence** and its **local
allies.**]{.underline} Finally, [the **education** narrative zooms in on
the **individual ability** to **navigate** and **process**
**information**, calling for]{.underline} the development of [**media
literacy** and **critical thinking**]{.underline} skillsets.

This [disentangling]{.underline} of the [HW discourse]{.underline} into
several cause--effect stories [has **important
consequences**]{.underline}, the analysis of which presents our first
contribution to the critical literature on HW (Daniel and Eberle, 2018;
Eberle and Daniel, 2019; Fridman, 2018; Galeotti, 2019; Mälksoo, 2018;
Monsees, 2020; Ördén, 2019; Rychnovská and Kohút, 2018), as well as the
broader field of Critical Security Studies. As mentioned earlier, [we
contribute to **destabilising** the **story** of a Russian malign
**meddling** that manipulates the **population** and **corrupts the
elites**]{.underline} (see Barša, 2020; Orenstein, 2019; Snyder, 2018)
[by showing]{.underline} that [there are]{.underline} important
[**discrepancies** between **various narratives**]{.underline}. Further,
[we advance this **scholarship** by taking another **step** and shifting
from the **variations** and **contradictions** on the level of
**narratives** to their underlying **knowledge** and **expertise** upon
which they **rely**. This takes us beyond the already **analysed**
construction of the HW problem in **particular
controversies**]{.underline} (Monsees, 2020) [and formation of
**policies** reacting to the HW in different institutions]{.underline}
(Ördén, 2019; Szostek, 2020). Put simply, [we do not look only at the
**narratives**]{.underline} as such[, but also at the
**knowledge**]{.underline} [that makes them **possible** and colours
them in a **certain way.**]{.underline}

Second, in highlighting this broader perspective, our study contributes
also to the literature on security knowledge and expertise (Aradau,
2017; Berling and Bueger, 2015; Leander and Wæver, 2019; Stampnitzky,
2014). As this work points out, [security threats are often
**not**]{.underline} readily [**connected** to an]{.underline} already
[existing body of **knowledge**]{.underline} (Berling, 2019;
Stampnitzky, 2014). Rather, [their construction requires the
**interpretive intervention** of experts who **connect** a
**threat**]{.underline} [with **specific knowledge** and **create** a
**narrative**]{.underline} linking causes of the threat, its effects and
needed courses of action (Edkins, 2019). Following this line of inquiry,
we show how the central categories of HW (hybrid war, hybrid threat,
etc.) function as discursive 'nodal points' (Diez, 2001; Laclau and
Mouffe, 1985) that draw together very different issues and fields of
knowledge -- for example, military science, media studies or popular
psychology. We add to this work by bringing a case study of HW as a
prime security discourse of our time, as well as by showing how
different HW narratives emerge through lenses provided by different
forms of knowledge. Synthesising the existing approaches in narrative
scholarship and security expertise, we develop a generally applicable
heuristic framework that allows for the identification and comparison of
security narratives and the knowledge that they are built on.

Conclusions

Ever since the Ukraine crises, [Russia and Norway have been talking each
other up as **multifaceted threats**]{.underline} as regards nearly all
aspects of relations. [This]{.underline} has [legitimized policy changes
far beyond the **security sphere**]{.underline} on both sides[,
which]{.underline} in turn are taken to [confirm]{.underline} these
[new]{.underline} and incompatible [identifications of the **other
side**. It]{.underline} has created a disconnect in communication and
recognition between Norway and Russia that [seems to be driving
**tension**]{.underline} upward [to]{.underline} a point
[where]{.underline} the outbreak of [**hostilities** seems
imminent]{.underline}. With the societal and political fracture since
the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian leadership\'s [heavy
securitization of **external threats**]{.underline} to the Russian self
[has been a prime]{.underline} social [mechanism for
creating]{.underline} a "sense of continuity and [order in
events]{.underline}" (Giddens 1991, 243). For the Norwegian leadership
post-2014---faced with what has appeared to be a far more dangerous and
unpredictable future---it has become imperative to pay attention to
internal audiences, revalidate self-identity and forge unity, within
Norway as well as in the wider West. And just as Russia fails to take
into account what its rejection of the West may look like on the other
side, Norway pays no attention to the audience on the other side of the
border in the North. The result? [The **verbal**]{.underline} and
practical [**dismissal** of Russia as a **legitimate
actor**]{.underline} across issue-areas in the North
**[triggers]{.underline}** and encourages [precisely the "**assertive**"
and "**aggressive**" Russia]{.underline} that [Norway has come to
**fear**. The]{.underline} Norwegian--Russian [case
illustrates]{.underline} vividly [how a **pair** of]{.underline}
collective [actors that experience]{.underline} acute [**ontological
dissonance** through]{.underline} their own [mutual]{.underline} and
multifaceted [securitization]{.underline}, and that seek to resolve this
dissonance through avoidance and externalization, [can be caught up in a
**spiral** that can lead to **confrontation**]{.underline}.

That said, for every other there usually are several identifications.
"Russia" has a range of deep-rooted identifications in Norwegian
political discourse; and in official texts 2014--2018, we can also see a
more reasonable and law-abiding Russian neighbor gradually re-emerging,
albeit in a small way. 126 There is an acknowledgment that the North is
of strategic importance for Russia, and even that Norway needs to
"respect Russia\'s legitimate security interests in the Arctic."127 [The
idea of **collaboration**]{.underline} on common interests
[is]{.underline} gradually [returning]{.underline} in MoD, MFA as well
as Prime Minister texts.128 Foreign Ministry [texts voice the need to
uphold cooperation in]{.underline} the spheres of [**fisheries**,
**nuclear safety**, the **environment** and]{.underline} natural
[**resource** management, **search-and-rescue**]{.underline} in the
Barents Sea, people-to-people collaboration, [and in
**forums**]{.underline} such as the Barents Council and Secretariat, and
the Arctic Council.129 [While this may look like]{.underline} a
**[reluctant de-securitization]{.underline}** from the side of the
Norwegian government---[these]{.underline} more [positive
identifications]{.underline} usually [appear when pressured
by]{.underline} domestic **[dissident audiences]{.underline}** in
Norway[---this]{.underline} also [sheds light on how **de-escalation**
may be achieved]{.underline}.

[First,]{.underline} in a democratic country such as Norway [the
audience does **play a role**. It can wage resistance by
rejecting]{.underline} a [securitizing]{.underline} narrative [and
giving voice to **alternative identifications**]{.underline} of Russia,
[at least **in certain issue-areas**, disfiguring the image of Russia as
a **multifaceted threat** and helping]{.underline} to [make]{.underline}
possible [positive interaction with]{.underline} and recognition of
[Russia in **certain issue-areas**]{.underline}. As noted by Wilhelmsen
(2017) and Lupovici (2012, 815--16), [securitizing actors are
constrained by **existing discursive structures**]{.underline}, the
specific discursive terrain in which they and their target audience are
embedded. While the Russian system has fewer such correctives,
criticisms of the stark securitization of the West are sometimes heard
from voices within the Russian elite.

[Second, political leaders can]{.underline} observe, learn, and
[make]{.underline} deliberate [choices about what identifications to
highlight when they speak of other states. Whereas the classical
interpretation of the security dilemma obscures]{.underline} the role of
[choice]{.underline} by foregrounding structure[, a discursive
interpretation foregrounds **human practice**. Political leaders operate
in **complex**, restraining **discursive terrains**]{.underline}, [but
can decide what identifications]{.underline} of self and other [to
**accentuate**]{.underline}. Norway\'s choices are not driven solely by
"systemic pressures," although this trope is constantly invoked. [The
return of]{.underline} "prudent **[restraint]{.underline}**"---the
realization that Norway does not need to embrace a total Cold-War-era
rejection of Russia---[is not **beyond reach**.]{.underline}

[Third]{.underline}, and to the case at hand, [interaction has a
**dynamic** of its **own**]{.underline}---in a very practical sense. Not
only do Norway and Russia still have several alternative, less-malign
identifications of each other to invoke, but these identifications have
also been implemented in long-standing practical collaboration in the
North. This heritage of [practical collaboration]{.underline} constantly
[becomes relevant through **unexpected happenings**]{.underline}. Such
events, with direct contact between Russian and Norwegian officials,
seem to elicit less-adverse official characterizations of the other.
Moreover, they complicate the image of the other for the political
leaders themselves. [The]{.underline} direct telephone [communication
between Prime Ministers]{.underline} Solberg and Medvedev [following a
**helicopter accident** at **Svalbard**]{.underline} in October 2017,
[with]{.underline} several [Russian fatalities, elicited
Norwegian]{.underline} official [representations of Russia
as]{.underline} a [**responsible** and **trustworthy**]{.underline}
actor.130 [From the Russian side came the acknowledgment: "We are
grateful to the Norwegian side for]{.underline} the [exceptionally high
level of interaction with]{.underline} the [Russian participants in the
search]{.underline} operation."131

[While these small signs of **positive recognition**]{.underline} and
interaction arguably [can]{.underline} contribute to
[chip]{.underline}ping [away at]{.underline} the new ice front that five
years of [mutual]{.underline} and multifaceted
[securitization]{.underline} has created in the North, the current
[tension will]{.underline} most [likely persist.]{.underline} Both for
Russia and Norway/the West the securitization of the other works as a
social glue in these times of global uncertainty.

### AT: Hybrid War K\-\--2AC

#### Researching the [methods]{.underline} and [culture]{.underline} of hybrid war is [important]{.underline}\-\--rejecting "hybrid war" exacerbates the danger it poses.

With great (power) wars past long ago and today's decline of inter-state
conflicts worldwide, with Pax Americana and Pax Europaea largely
enduring since the end of the WWII (thus, democratizing nations and
relations among them)1 , a Fukuyama-styled decisive victory of a liberal
democratic order willy-nilly crosses one's mind. And yet, the
1989-declared 'end of the history' has to be postponed -- again:

'There is a feeling abroad today that Western civilization is on trial
before history. One of the clearest signs of it is the increasing
frequency with which we hear the word "challenge" in connection with the
policies and progress of Soviet \[Putin's\] Russia and the Communist
\[illiberal\] world at large' (Tucker 1959: 1) (edits to the original
mine. -- AT).

It sufficed two tiny edits (updates -- if you wish) in the afore-quoted
statement to render the strategic world-political assessment of the
1960s-peaking Cold War, made by a renowned American Sovietologist at
Harvard and Princeton Universities, its full-sound quality and resonance
in the realities of our-age and twenty-second century global politics

Indeed, just a decade ago, as Russia's military campaign in Georgia was
unfolding, the near and far neighbourhood's discourses were intensively
echoing questions such as: 'Is Ukraine next?' Some half a decade ago, as
Russia's less conventional military aggression and political subversion
campaign in Ukraine erupted, questions did resonate in the region and
far beyond: 'Are the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia
next'2 ? Couple of years ago, as Russia's covert military and political
overtures in Syria and Libya, US and the UK, Germany, France, Poland,
the Netherlands and so forth unraveled, the answers to the question
'who's next?' seem to have been tacitly found -- at least no more
geographical directions are being pointed to. The paradox discovered
here lies in the simplicity that was self-delusively denied being
accepted in many European capitals: the genuine realist answer to the
'what/where/ who next?' question has always been 'where necessary -- to
defend national interests' (however defined). [Waging a **hybrid
war**]{.underline}(fare) [has become one of the proven ways to defend
Russia's interests]{.underline} in near and far neighbourhoods. Rather
disturbingly, [it is]{.underline} incrementally becoming [a preferred
way to advance interests of other state and non-state actors. The spread
of the **hybrid warfare methods** and the **culture of hybrid
war**]{.underline} as such [is a **new reality** to which the
policymakers and scholarly communities alike need to **wake
up.**]{.underline}

[A number of]{.underline} analytical [works]{.underline} written so far
[have been dedicated to disentangling]{.underline} the [hybrid warfare's
**nature** and **manifestations**]{.underline}, i.e. the art of war. [It
is of **little use** if]{.underline} it is [not accompanied
with]{.underline} the [analysis of '**whose war**?']{.underline} problem
[in the sense of seeking response to the]{.underline} fundamental
[questions **who** is **waging the war** (**aggressor**), to **what
end** (]{.underline}broad [**strategic** and **tactical aims**), against
**whom** (**war targets** and **theatres**) and who will stand in
**defence**]{.underline} (national and/or **[collective
defence]{.underline}** and deterrence)? The vast majority of these
[questions is left **unanswered**]{.underline} in much of the scholarly
and policy writings. [Ambiguity and]{.underline} deliberate
[straight-talk avoidance abound. Ambiguity is the]{.underline} best
[**bedfellow** of **hybrid war**]{.underline}(fare). Thus, [as long as
there is]{.underline} a lack/[**avoidance** of **clarity** in
**scholarly**]{.underline} and political [**answers** to the
**aforementioned questions**, the **international constellations** will
remain **thriving** for a **spatial** and **temporal** **contagion of
hybrid war**(fare).]{.underline}

This article seeks to problematize the contagion of hybrid war and
hybrid warfare -- both with the zoom on Russia and in a much wider
world-political perspective: geographic, temporal and agential.

[With no pretense to]{.underline} pathetic or [**inflated claims**, this
article casts a **broad**]{.underline} analytical [**perspective** on
the **creeping hybridization** of war and order and posits]{.underline}
that [the phenomenon is **there** to **stay** unless]{.underline}
strategically **[contained]{.underline}** and devaluated as a
proliferating means of twenty-first century politics. Thereby, [it
invites **thinking beyond** '**the Ukraine crisis'**]{.underline} [and
**'the Russia challenge'**]{.underline} in (Eastern) Europe -- i.e. a
well-founded, though, admittedly, a way too narrow (both spatially and
temporally, as well as in terms of agency and warfare modalities)
hyper-focus in much of the political and academic debate today.
[The]{.underline} currently [observed **expansion** of Russia's theatres
of hybrid war]{.underline}(fare) [from **Ukraine** to **Middle East**,
**Europe** and the **US**, as well as]{.underline} the tactical variance
and [constant **innovation** of warfighting]{.underline} methods, as
practiced and mutually observed/emulated by agents beyond Russia (such
as Iran, China, or the ISIS), [points to the pertinence of]{.underline}
broader [emerging trends that **concern** the foundations of
**international theory**, **strategic** and **military
studies**]{.underline} -- rather than policy or area studies alone. [The
**contagion**]{.underline} [effects of **hybrid war**]{.underline}(fare)
[**discursive** and **political practices**]{.underline} across the
globe [is what shapes the]{.underline} core [analytical
puzzle]{.underline} of the current article. Focusing on [the
**ontologies** of the **hybrid war** and **warfare
contagion**]{.underline}, as evidenced in proliferating ideologies and
politics of hybrid war(fare) as well as richly documented in policy
analyses and scholarly literature, this article [problematizes the
**agency**]{.underline} (action-reaction) **[dilemmas]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} both [states and societies]{.underline} directly
[targeted by]{.underline} such [hostile campaigns]{.underline} as well
as the international (liberal democratic) community at large.

NATO

"[Hybrid warfare]{.underline}" has [emerged as]{.underline} yet [another
"**resilience test**"]{.underline} (Stoltenberg 2015a) [for the Alliance
in its]{.underline} post-Cold War [existential search for a **new
purpose**]{.underline} and mission. Moreover, the **[hybrid
insecurity]{.underline}** predicament [enables]{.underline} the [allies
to bring together]{.underline} the [renewed focus on NATO's
**traditional** mission (i.e.]{.underline} endorsing **[collective
defence]{.underline}** in order to counter the main geopolitical
contestant of the North Atlantic Alliance in Europe[) and]{.underline}
the Alliance's post-Cold War [out-of-area]{.underline} military
[expeditions]{.underline}. While "tak\[ing\] on two different forms of
strategic challenges simultaneously" -- that is, "the Russian [hybrid
warfare]{.underline} approach" and that of "other non-state actors like
ISIS to the south" -- [remains NATO's "**greatest
challenge**"]{.underline}, the common idea behind these "hybrid
strategies" endorses the relevance of "a comprehensive approach across
the DIMEFIL spectrum" (i.e. diplomatic/political, information, military,
economic, financial, intelligence, legal) for NATO (Breedlove 2015, p.
xxv; cf. Bell 2012, pp. 225--226). The "beauty of the hybrid warfare
concept" is accordingly seen to lie in its ability to "provide tools for
a comparative strategic perspective of NATO's southern and eastern
flanks, while allowing for a differentiated response" (Johnson 2015, p.
276). [NATO's motto]{.underline} in the face of these twofold challenges
[is called to be "adopt, adapt, adept": the]{.underline} new
[strategies]{.underline} adopted [to deal with]{.underline} the [hybrid
threats]{.underline} to NATO's East and South [need to be accompanied by
NATO's adaptation of "its structure]{.underline} and readiness [to
become adept at handling]{.underline} the [new challenges]{.underline}
it faces" (Calha 2015, p. 9).

[Countering hybrid threats]{.underline} posed by Russia and the Islamic
radicals [threatening]{.underline} the territories, populations,
interests, and values of [the Alliance]{.underline} thus [enables NATO
to endorse its]{.underline} continuing [relevance by constructing a
**strong narrative** and maintaining]{.underline} its [**OS** as the
core security guarantor for its **members**]{.underline} (cf. Flockhart
2012, pp. 78--79). [The softer, partnershipgeared]{.underline}, or
so-called "Jane" [narrative of]{.underline} the early-[post Cold War
NATO is]{.underline} clearly [giving way to a more familiar, **hard
security-focused** "Tarzan" self-vision and public
representation]{.underline} (see further Flockhart 2011). Calling the
kettle black is the least of NATO's worries: [Russia's use of "proxy
soldiers, unmarked Special Forces, intimidation and propaganda, all to
lay a thick fog of confusion; to obscure its]{.underline} true [purpose
in Ukraine; and to attempt deniability" is]{.underline} explicitly
[dissected in outlining NATO's emerging counter-strategy to hybrid
engagements]{.underline} of the sort (Stoltenberg 2015a). Yet, just the
traditional set of [NATO's capabilities is]{.underline} clearly
[deemed]{.underline} to be [insufficient in the face of]{.underline},
inter alia, "[sophisticated disinformation]{.underline} and
radicalization [campaigns]{.underline}" (Stoltenberg 2015b),
[this]{.underline} more forceful and traditional [antagonist-driven
agenda reflects NATO's]{.underline} long-pursued comprehensive approach
-- that is, "a [combination of military and non-military means to
stabilize countries]{.underline}" (that others use to "destabilize")
(Stoltenberg 2015a). "[Hybrid]{.underline}" [is]{.underline} accordingly
coined as "[the **dark reflection**]{.underline}" [of NATO's
comprehensive approach, and]{.underline} accordingly, early warning and
situation awareness, [good governance and]{.underline} the
[resilience]{.underline} of societies [become]{.underline} equally
[essential parts of **deterrence** and **defence** against **hybrid
threats**]{.underline} (Stoltenberg 2015a). This necessitates "renewed
attention to strategic communications" and public outreach and education
"to build up public awareness and resilience" and "strengthen the role
of an informed civil society in every member state" (Calha 2015, p.
10).13

[NATO declared]{.underline} its [readiness to address]{.underline} the
specific [challenges posed by "**hybrid warfare threats**" in the Wales
Summit]{.underline} Declaration [of 5 September 2014 as a forceful
response to the conflict in **Ukraine**]{.underline}.
[While]{.underline} NATO's traditional toolbox of [collective defence is
hardly]{.underline} perfectly [geared for "]{.underline}insidious and
[ambiguous threats"]{.underline} (Johnson 2015, p. 270, Calha 2015, p.
4), [countering hybrid warfare emerges as a continuing]{.underline}
relevance and [resilience test for the **Alliance**]{.underline}. NATO's
institutional responses to "hybrid threats" have been further detailed
in its Readiness Action Plan, a roadmap for building capability
packages, a comprehensive concept for creating an enhanced NATO response
force, in a classified strategy for hybrid warfare and a cyber security
action plan. [Altogether, the **ambiguity**]{.underline} and gradient
nature [of **hybrid tactics**]{.underline} directly [challenge the
ontological underpinnings of NATO's **core mission** and **strength** as
hybrid activities might "progress]{.underline} incrementally [towards a
**threatening situation** while remaining under NATO's **Article 5
threshold**]{.underline}" (Calha 2015, p. 4). [The]{.underline}
detection and [definition of a **threat**]{.underline} hence
[becomes]{.underline} significantly [less **straightforward**, pointing
at the need to renegotiate the **scope** and **substance** of NATO's
**collective defence clause**]{.underline} (i.e. Article 5 of the
Washington Treaty) [in light of]{.underline} the contemporary **[hybrid
engagements]{.underline}**.

#### Hybrid war is [real]{.underline} and [dangerous]{.underline}.

Certainly, an unnecessary reverberation (if not simply a hype) of the
term bears nasty consequences for policy response as [the first
question]{.underline} being naturally [advanced is whethe]{.underline}r
the **[hybrid warfare]{.underline}** talk [is 'much ado about
**nothing'** or a **serious concern**]{.underline} about the emerging
security gap[?]{.underline} In a way, [the]{.underline} entire
[problematique gets ridiculed to the]{.underline} somewhat
[simplified]{.underline} and overgeneralized dilemmatic [question to be

selectively presented in the next section, [suggests a **positive

3\. EXPLORING HYBRID WARΈFAREΉ CONTAGION: TRENDS AND GEOGRAPHIES

[Ev]{.underline}idence from much of the public, political and academic
debate convincingly [demonstrates: the proliferation of hybrid
war]{.underline} and warfare [are more than a **'buzzword'
matter**]{.underline} -- legible [concerns about it]{.underline}
incrementally [grow across]{.underline} the [**nations**, **regions**
and]{.underline} even entire **[continents]{.underline}**, with some
being more and some less affected by hybrid war(fare) contagion. Both
public, political and academic issue [salience point to such a
**conclusion**]{.underline}.

For instance, [the hybrid war]{.underline}(fare) [topic trending
in]{.underline} public [discourse exhibits]{.underline} quite [a
**revealing picture** of **issue salience** since]{.underline} at least
[2004]{.underline}, with the European terrain being the epicenter of
public attention to the issue in question (cf. Figure 2).
[The]{.underline} geographical [spread of hybrid war]{.underline}(fare)
-- or a threat thereof, as perceived in public discourses,
[is]{.underline} most [concentrated around the top]{.underline}
topic-trending [countries, with Ukraine]{.underline} -- rather
expectedly -- [enjoying the place of the most **important locus** of
**attention**, followed by]{.underline} Poland, Estonia, Bulgaria and
Georgia, Croatia, Czechia, Latvia, Belarus, and Finland on [the top-10
list]{.underline}.

**\[Omit Figure 2\]**

In policy debate, [the hybrid war]{.underline}(fare) topic [salience can
be observed in]{.underline} a number of world's regions -- from the
topic-trending [Russia]{.underline} and the former Soviet Union space
[to integrated **Europe** and **North America**, but also **Middle
East**, **Asia** and **Africa**]{.underline} (cf. Table 1).

**\[Omit Table 1\]**

As seen from the table, hybrid warfare clearly presents a salient policy
issue for Russia's neighbours -- first and foremost, Ukraine, Belarus,
CEECs such as Poland or Czechia as well as the Baltic states. Within the
so-called Commonwealth of Independent states (CIS) alone, the situation
is quite telling as '\[e\]ach of Russia's reform-minded neighbours is
plagued by "separatism"4 \[ -- and\] it's no coincidence' (Orttung and
Walker 2015). Of course, the scope and extent of hybrid threats is
bigger than that: in addition to the weaponization of self-determination
(so-called astroturfed 'separatism'), both information and culture,
economics and democratic openness, etc., are seen being weaponized
within respective hybrid warfare stratagems.

Finally, [the ev]{.underline}idence [of hybrid war]{.underline}(fare)
topic [salience can]{.underline} also [be found in]{.underline} the
**[academic debate]{.underline}**, as the herewith undertaken
bibliometric analysis shows. Whereas the current article's effort is
concentrated on pinpointing the academic salience of the topic as
covered in major Web of Science indexed journals (cf. Figure 3), it
should be acknowledged that [the topic is covered]{.underline} much
[broadly in]{.underline} non-WoS indexed **[peer-reviewed
journals]{.underline}**. Still, the academic production corpus of WoS
indexed journals reveals the topical salience of hybrid war(fare) in
scholarly enquiries on security and defence affairs in Ukraine, the US,
Romania, UK, Poland, Russia, Czechia, Germany, Austria and Italy. A
clear gap in topic coverage by academic literature, as revealed by the
WoS corpus analysis, is rather surprising compared to other indexed
outlets as well as public and political debates -- much broader in their
geographic and issue-matter foci, with a centre of analytical gravity
that massively revolves around Russia's agency in that very context (at
the expense of a wider perspective?).

**\[Omit Figure 3\]**

Thence, with a varying intensity and focus laid on state and non-state
agency as well as geographic theatres of hybrid warfare operation, [the
topic is **clearly salient** in]{.underline} both [public, political and
academic debates, and]{.underline} this salience [is]{.underline} very
much [predicted to expand further]{.underline} -- together [with the
proliferation of the **hybrid war culture**]{.underline} and hybrid
warfare methods [among **countries**]{.underline} and regions
**[worldwide]{.underline}**.

An exponential rise of the '[hybrid warfare]{.underline}' phenomenon
[owes its dynamics]{.underline} particularly to the number of military
and politically subversive [operations Russia has undertaken
since]{.underline} early [2014 in]{.underline} Ukraine's [**Crimea**
and]{.underline} eastern regions of **[Donbas]{.underline}**. The
phenomenon is much broader both in terms of geographical and agential
spread worldwide, with some parts of Eurasia, Middle East and Asia
Pacific looming large as the hotbeds of this proliferating type of
warfare below (classical understanding of) war.

Internet search retrievals abound in references to academic and policy
writings as well as journalist investigations on the matter.

Official communications delivered by [government officials]{.underline}
and high-ranking international fonctionnaires worldwide, too,
[contain]{.underline} increasing [references to]{.underline} the
proliferation of [**'hybrid threats'** and]{.underline} the [necessity
of]{.underline} developing [a **suitable policy response**]{.underline}
-- both [in]{.underline} national and [**intergovernmental**
contexts]{.underline}.

All that points to a rather new development where the prerogatively
military term and the related vocabulary of 'hybrid warfare' lose their
exclusivity as concepts applied by, and relevant for 'military
strategists only', thus entering the everyday political and diplomatic
vocabulary as well as public discourses.

Whether in Estonia, Czechia or Poland (Schultz 2017), Germany, France or
the Netherlands, Russia's hybrid warfare operational theatre steadily
expands to new sovereign terrains of the Western liberal democracies.

Following Russia's resonant and highly plausible meddling in the 2016 US
presidential elections, in 2017, then-presidential candidate Emmanuel
Macron successfully dodged similar hack-and-leak cyber-attacks and fake
news reports widely attributable to the Kremlin. In late 2018, the
French authorities faced a renewed challenge of Kremlin's digital
offensive -- now from among 600 Twitter pro-Kremlin accounts that, under
the top hashtag #giletsjaunes, i.e. 'yellow vests', intensively fuel
outrage of street protesters. Possible involvement of the Kremlin in
amplifying the 'yellow vests' protests in France (cf. e.g.: Blakely
2018; Matlack 2018) is now being investigated by the French authorities
in spite of Russia's 'traditional' implausible denials

In response to [the Skripal poisoning]{.underline} earlier [in
2018]{.underline}, yet another widely [attributed to]{.underline} the
[Kremlin]{.underline} undercover operation in Europe and the UK in
particular, British PM Theresa May bluntly put it that '\[t\]he Russian
threat does not respect borders, and as such we are all at risk' (quoted
after: McTague, 2018). [The threat **looms**]{.underline} even more so
[large if one considers the **strategic rationale** of **Russia's hybrid
gambit**]{.underline} -- in fact, [an **undeclared war** against the
**Western-dominated world order** and the **hegemony** of]{.underline}
the **[liberal democracy]{.underline}** as such.

In this war, [Ukraine is]{.underline} only [one of the **many targets**
and **theatres**, which expand in]{.underline} both the [**scope** and
**depth**]{.underline} of engagement -- as far as the strategic and
operational goals will require

The case of [Russia's]{.underline} 'hybression'[,]{.underline} i.e.
[hybrid aggression]{.underline}, in Ukraine [is quite **illustrative**
when it comes to]{.underline} the [**contagion effects** of]{.underline}
(strategic) [**hybrid warfare** proliferation]{.underline}.

[**First**, the Blitzanschluss of Crimea]{.underline} (the so-called
'self-determination' staged by the Russian special operation forces)[,
then the]{.underline} ([failed]{.underline}) attempts to extend hybrid
incursion to Ukraine's wider South-East (the so-called ['Novorossia'
offensive]{.underline}), [successful detachment of Ukraine's eastern
areas]{.underline} (the so-called 'separatism' [in Donbas]{.underline}
region), [and]{.underline}, more [recently]{.underline}, renewed
[attempts to twist the '**Novorossia'** **offensive**]{.underline}, now
undertaken as a naval offensive [in the Kerch Strait]{.underline} of the
Sea of Azov. Not only did the geography of Russia's operational theatre
expand in Ukraine -- [every]{.underline} next [struggle]{.underline},
however narrow (MacFarquhar 2018), [risks **wider war**]{.underline}

Fifth year on, [the contagion of Russia's **hybrid warfare**
can]{.underline} now however [be traced far beyond **Ukraine's
borders**]{.underline}. Already back in 2015, Zbigniew Brzeziński, a
senior political scientist and former adviser to the US-American
President Jimmy Carter, was not sparkling with optimism as the Russian
war in Ukraine was concerned. In the wake of his March 2015 visit to
Poland, he put his advice for the compatriots in a very succinct and
unequivocal passage: 'Ukraine is not the endpoint. We have to be ready
to defend ourselves' (Brzeziński 2015).

Time and again, [Polish]{.underline} intelligence agency ABW and
investigative [journalists uncover Russia-linked **subversive groups**
who]{.underline} -- via disinformation campaigns or political subversion
(astroturfing, false flag outrage) -- seek to [exacerbate
tensions]{.underline} both [within the **Polish society** and with
**Ukraine**]{.underline} -- [to sow **discord** between **Poland** and
**Ukraine**]{.underline}, thus directly or indirectly promoting the
Kremlin's interests (DW, 2018). [The **tension** in]{.underline}
Polish-Ukrainian [relations]{.underline} may [resonate well
beyond]{.underline} the confines of [this bilateralism]{.underline}, not
least in the context of Poland's role as a key supporter of pro-Western
policy attitudes in Ukraine and pro-Ukrainian policy attitudes in the
European Union, both of which run contra Kremlin's illiberal script for
the post-Soviet space.

Up north in the Baltics, the spread of [Russian hybrid warfare became
a]{.underline} serious [political concern the]{.underline} very [moment
Russia annexed **Crimea** from **Ukraine** in]{.underline} early [2014.
Whether the Baltic states were]{.underline} (to be) [next, has
been]{.underline} since then [one of the **permeating questions** in
**security debate**]{.underline} both within the small region and
Europe-wide (Radin 2017).

A number of other European countries and [Western democracies have been
affected by]{.underline} the spread of [Russia's hybrid war]{.underline}
from Crimea to Salisbury, for the past five years now. [Whereas
tracing]{.underline} (and predicting) [the contagion]{.underline}
effects [of hybrid warfare]{.underline} in toto [is]{.underline} quite
[a daunting task]{.underline} -- not least because of the problematic
means identification and agency attribution, [its main **components**,
such as **information weaponization**]{.underline} (fake news spread,
public and media propaganda campaigns) [or '**weaponized
self-determination'**]{.underline} (external orchestration, partisan
sponsoring or otherwise supporting of 'self-determination' processes
regionwide), [can be feasibly analyzed]{.underline}. For instance,
[Cunningham and Sawyer's]{.underline} (2017: 598) **[spatial
analysis]{.underline}** of the spread of self-determination claims --
statistically -- [confirms]{.underline} that that [self-determination is
**contagious**]{.underline}, for the onset of self-determination claims
in a country is strongly predicted by the onset of self-determination
claims in the neighbourhood. [The observations]{.underline} of the
micro-regional dynamics in Eastern Europe and South Caucasus
well-[illustrate such a contagion -- from **Nagorno Karabakh** to
**Transnistria**]{.underline}, form [**Abkhazia** and **South Ossetia**
to **Crimea** and]{.underline} (partially) [**Donbas**, and]{.underline}
to a smaller extent, **[Gaugauzia]{.underline}**. Rather unsurprisingly,
[Russia's orchestrating]{.underline} or other-how instrumental efforts
behind these processes [have been **disentangled** and]{.underline}
moderately well **[documented]{.underline}**. With Putin's
Blitzanschluss of Crimea in 2014, [the debate about]{.underline} the
challenges of a [weaponized 'self-determination]{.underline} in the age
of Putin' (Simpson 2014) [loom large]{.underline} -- and not only in the
context of lasting fears in the Baltics about the externally-strategized
secession of Latvian Latgale or Estonian Narva provinces; [the concerns
grow in]{.underline} 'old [Europe']{.underline}, too, especially [after
Russia's]{.underline} considerable politically [subversive effort was
identified behind the]{.underline} 2017 [Catalan referendum]{.underline}
in Spain (Palmer 2017; Emmott 2017; Alandete 2017b; EFE 2018)
[and]{.underline} the '**[Brexit']{.underline}** campaign [in the
**UK**]{.underline}, which, in a way, too, can be seen as a case for (a
different but still a kind of) 'self-determination' -- i.e. British
determination to 'depart' away from Brussels and the EU's institutional
embrace. Importantly, one should, to a lesser extent, perceive such a
subversion driven by the Kremlin as a hostile act strictly against
respective nation-states, or at least nation-states alone (Cohen and
Radin 2019) -- [such a weaponization of '**self-determination**'
processes]{.underline} in Europe [targets the **European Union** and its
**transatlantic links**, which stand in the epicentre of **Russia's
fight** against the]{.underline} liberal democratic hegemony of the
**[Euro-Atlantic order]{.underline}**. Bonet (2017) put it quite
eloquently when referring to the Russian influence campaigns in Spanish
Catalonia: 'Russia's official media speak about Catalonia, but they are
really shooting at Brussels, using the referendum as ammunition'

The [Russian uses of **referenda** as part of **political
warfare**]{.underline} campaigns abroad are not limited to the cases of
self-determination. Its uses [span across a variety of]{.underline}
deliberative [democratic]{.underline} policymaking [processes --
from]{.underline} policy-consultative **[referenda]{.underline}**, such
as the 2016 Dutch referendum on the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement or
the 'Brexit' referendum (Ostanin and Rose 2016), [to **electoral
campaigns**, such as]{.underline} the [2016 US]{.underline} presidential
[elections, German]{.underline} 2017 [parliamentary
elections]{.underline} (Applebaum et al. 2017), [French 2017
presidential elections]{.underline} (Dearden 2017), etc. The evidence
abounds that the 'weaponization of referenda' has meanwhile successfully
broadened in its use as part of the hybrid warfare toolkit. NATO
Parliamentary Assembly STC's most recent report on Russian meddling in
elections and referenda in the Alliance (cf. Davis 2018) draws on the
collected evidence of the Kremlin's past elections and referenda
influence campaigns in the US, UK, France, Germany, Spain and the
Netherlands, and argues that [such]{.underline} interference [operations
pose a]{.underline} serious [**threat** to the **Alliance** and its
members, especially]{.underline} when seen [against the **broader
efforts** of Russia to **divide**, **destabilise** and]{.underline}
otherwise [undermine **Alliance** **members**]{.underline}.

[Russia's hybrid warfare proliferates]{.underline}, however, well
[beyond the **weaponization** of '**self-determination'** and
'**referenda**' campaigns. It includes]{.underline} a range of
activities in [stirring up **dissent**]{.underline} abroad [-- from
influencing **campaigns**]{.underline} [to financial **military** and
**political support** of]{.underline} local [**radical groups** or
**insurgent forces**]{.underline}. In this context,
[Afghanistan]{.underline} [is]{.underline} yet [another]{.underline}
largely [overlooked **grey zone** of Russia's]{.underline} proliferating
**[hybrid war]{.underline}** [against the **West**]{.underline} sought
to undermine the latter's global hegemony and resources in sustaining
it, inter alia by provoking -- mainly the US -- to fight on several
fronts (cf. e.g: Sazonov 2017). Casting a look at Afghanistan (again!)
and actively courting the Taliban through arms supply and diplomatic
conciliation amidst still designating it a terrorist group and
domestically outlawing as such (cf. e.g.: Ramani 2019) has little good
reason and military-strategic promise -- if not considered against the
Kremlin's prima facie irrational (but no lesser deployed for that very
reason!) strategy of inducing a 'manageable chaos'5 , i.e. an operation
in shaping a strategic environment conducive to Russia's broader
political warfare against the West. In the Kremlin's forceful drive
against the international liberal order and the 'power of rules', [the
strategic value of]{.underline} a spread of [**ambiguity**,
**uncertainty**, **chaos**]{.underline} and hesitation (be it via
proliferation of grey-zone conflicts and hybression of sorts,
weaponization of migration, populism or the rise of the so-called
illiberal democracies, etc.) [can **hardly be
overestimated**]{.underline} (cf. e.g.: Tyushka 2018).

[Reviving]{.underline} dormant [ethnic]{.underline}-political
[tensions]{.underline}, sowing distrust, exaggerating tensions up to
[staging coups (such as the attended coup in
**Montenegro**]{.underline}, cf.: Higgins 2016) [is]{.underline} yet
[another modality of **political warfare** the Kremlin wages in the
**Western Balkans**]{.underline}, in addition to the heating-up of
separatist and revisionist movements (Bechev 2018).

Ironically enough, hybrid warfare campaigns can, too, spread to include
deceptively 'integrative' agendas. As the pressure of Western sanctions
and tensions between Russia and Belarus grow, the discussions on
Russia's possible hybrid invasion of Belarus have started to unfold
among regional security scholars, especially after their joint 2017
'Zapad' ('West') military drills (Wilson 2017) and more recent Kremlin's
calls for a closer integration between Russia and Belarus (Applebaum
2019).

Even though the prominence of Russia's hybrid warfare in the region
abounds in its scope and intensity, [it would be wrongful to attribute
**all**]{.underline} the endeavor and 'brilliance' in contemporary
practices of **[hybrid warfare]{.underline}** [to Russia]{.underline}
alone: [a number of other state]{.underline} and non-state
[actors]{.underline} worldwide, unilaterally or collectively, [resort to
**hybrid tactics**]{.underline} in support of their diverse strategic
goals -- [from **China**, **India**, **Pakistan**, **Qatar** or **Iran**
to the **US**]{.underline} (cf. Figures 2 and 3, and Table 1 above). In
the Middle East, Iran and Qatar come to the fore of attention. Dalton
(2017: 312) posits that, for as long as the past three decades, [Iran
'has grown **proficient**]{.underline} at [using hybrid-war
capabilities]{.underline} and tactics to achieve its regional
objectives', typically [operating below the threshold of]{.underline}
conventional [warfare]{.underline}, thus 'using a blend of military and
paramilitary tools, including proxy forces, missiles, cyber tools,
maritime forces, and information operations to share and coerce regional
actors to its advantage'. Supporting non-state actors, like Hezbollah
and other proxy groups from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan or Pakistan, forms
part of the Iran's regional leverage toolkit. In Asia and its regional
security architecture, proliferation of hybrid warfare may, too, be
fraught with systemic consequences. Niruthan (2016) contends that,
already now, '\[m\]any of the conditions that breed hybrid threats are
ripe for harvest in the Asian continent, with its ethnic conflicts, a
vibrant tech industry, territorial disputes, and inconsistent rule of
law'. [Whereas the topic reappears]{.underline} more [frequently
in]{.underline} the discussions of [China's]{.underline} 'legal alchemy'
and [political subversion around the **South China Sea**]{.underline}
dispute, potential [cradles of hybrid]{.underline} warfare in Asia may
also [become **Burma**]{.underline} (Myanmar), [**Thailand** or
**Pakistan**, with the latter]{.underline} one [becoming]{.underline}
incrementally [framed in]{.underline} the regional [political discourses
as]{.underline} both [a **target**]{.underline} (Khan 2018) [and a
**wager** of **hybrid warfare**]{.underline} in its rivalry with India
(AFP Kargil, 2014; Kumar 2017).

Evidently, the geography and uses of hybrid war(fare) manifest contagion
effects, which remain underexplored in the subject-matter literature.

Asymmetric threats

**[Against]{.underline}** the **[challenges]{.underline}** and
geopolitical processes [in the **modern**]{.underline} period
[**world**, **research of the challenges**]{.underline} coming [**from**
**asymmetrical threats** and **hybrid warfare** is]{.underline} very
[**important**. The world faces]{.underline} a number of [challenges
that cannot be solved without a **united effort**]{.underline}.
Therefore, [it becomes necessary to create **alliances** and
enhance]{.underline} the effectiveness of **[international
organizations]{.underline}**. Coming from the current situation of
today's reality and geopolitical changes the role and the function of
[NATO is]{.underline} very [important in]{.underline} world
**[security]{.underline}** issues. Since the establishment of the North
Atlantic Alliance, [ensuring **collective defence**]{.underline} and
security is one of the main principles and purposes of functioning of
this organization that require the Alliance to prevent the land, air and
naval attacks with united forces, however, in modern times the Alliance
[faced new challenges]{.underline} that come [from **asymmetric
threats** and **hybrid warfare**]{.underline}.

The security trends play the great role in the process of forming a new
system of international relations. In the past few years, one can often
hear the reasoning that the nature of war in the twenty-first century
has changed. Non-state structures even a century ago used partisan
methods of warfare, and the beginning of the twentieth century was
marked by the use of terrorist tactics.

[Before we]{.underline} begin to [talk about **asymmetric threats**
and]{.underline} a **[hybrid war]{.underline}**, it is important to
[consider what these]{.underline} two [phenomena mean]{.underline} and
what role they play in global security. During the consideration of the
hybrid war, it is interesting to pay attention to the asymmetric warfare
factor - [asymmetric war represents]{.underline} such [a war when the
military powers of]{.underline} the [opposing sides clearly
differ]{.underline} from each other. The military tactics or the
strategy used by them are very different from each other.

The term [asymmetric warfare is]{.underline} used when
[describing]{.underline} situations such as [guerrilla warfare,
terrorism, insurrection]{.underline} and during such armed conflicts
when regular military force confronts an irregular, ill-armed opponent.

The term became popular in 1975, when Andrew J. R. Mack, wrote in
academic journal World Politics, \"Why Big Nations Lose Small Wars,\"
where he used an asymmetric war to determine the differences between
important military forces among the parties involved. In the word
\"power\" he meant the material strength, like a large army, good
weapons, a developed economy, etc.

As for the connection of the asymmetric war with terrorism, there are
different opinions on this issue. In today\'s world, asymmetric warfare
is being increasingly considered as a part of the fourth generation war.
Some believe that if the asymmetric war goes beyond the rules of war, it
turns into terrorism. In addition, some believe that the asymmetric war
is not connected with terrorism. They believe, because of the propaganda
of the strong parties, it identifies the weaker party as bandits or
terrorists. They also believe that the word terrorism is specifically
used for political purposes because of its negative significance. [One
of the **main security problems** of the **modern world** is
asymmetrical threats, such as]{.underline} international [terrorism
and]{.underline} transnational [organized crime]{.underline}; Weapons,
[including **weapons** of **mass destruction**]{.underline} and its
components[; Also]{.underline} illegal drugs and drug trafficking; Human
trafficking, [**cybercrime**, and the **fourth generation
war**]{.underline}. There are many other types of confrontations -
rebellion, civil war, revolution, etc.

The tactical [success of **asymmetric wars** depends on several
components]{.underline}. On the example of technological advantage - [if
any party has]{.underline} a [**technological advantage**, this can
outweigh the enemy\'s **numerical advantage**. Neutrality of
**technological advantage** is possible on]{.underline} important [enemy
facilities and with an attack on **infrastructure**. With
attacking]{.underline} the [electrical power]{.underline} lines or
generators, roads, pipelines or water. In heavily populated places, such
[sabotage can]{.underline} greatly [affect]{.underline} the [**morale**
and **economics**]{.underline} of people inhabiting the territories.
[The weaker side]{.underline} in such a war [uses **special
tactics**]{.underline} to cope with a strong opponent. You can break the
rules of war and use them for your own good. The rules of war prohibits
the use of a medical machine for asylum, an attack or an ambush, and the
use of urban settlement for military bases is also prohibited. The
weaker side uses such tactics with the hope that the opposing party will
defend the rules of war and not attack the city2 .

[The]{.underline} beginning of the [21st century brought]{.underline}
about [non-conventional]{.underline} security [threats]{.underline}
(they include [natural disasters]{.underline}, drug, weapon and human
[trafficking, **cyber warfare** and piracy]{.underline}, etc.) [which
represent]{.underline} new [challenges for]{.underline} those
[international organizations that consider maintenance of **security**
and **stability** as their **principal goal**]{.underline} on either
global or regional levels. [The **North-Atlantic Alliance** has taken
the responsibility for addressing]{.underline} these new
[challenges]{.underline}3 .

[Today **NATO** provides]{.underline} its [capabilities and resources to
assist]{.underline} international and regional [organizations in
tackling crises and resolving]{.underline} a wide range of
[problems]{.underline}

Asymmetric warfare used to be determined as "a conflict including two
states with different total military and economic resources". However
after 9/11 attacks the definition has been adjusted, Asymmetric warfare
is now defined as "using inferior tactical or operational strength
against the vulnerabilities of superior opponent to achieve the
disproportionate effect with the aim of undermining \[the opponent's\]
will in order to achieve the asymmetric actor's strategic objectives."4

The problem of terrorism is not only the problem of a single country but
also the first enemy of international security. The terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001 (9/11) led to a more clear perception of the threat
of terrorism. Terrorism has become the most acute issue after this
incident, and maintains the considerable attention of the international
community until now.

After 9/11 terrorist attack, NATO instantly expressed support for U.S.
For the first time NATO activated the Article 5, which envisaged the
collective protection of member states at risk. The purpose of this
action was not only America fighting against terrorism. Europe joined
the events of 9/11. The fight against terrorism became the mainstay of
EU member states.

While we start talking about the factor of hybrid war in the modern era,
let us see what the existing theories and their authors are saying about
the hybrid war. In general, [there are two]{.underline} basic mental
[approaches around]{.underline} the [**hybrid war.** Some researchers
think]{.underline} that [a \"**hybrid war**\" is a **reality** that
needs to be understood. They think]{.underline} that [this is
**separate** from the **traditional** and non-**traditional
possibilities** of creating a **war**, although it includes
**both**]{.underline}. [According to the **second part** of the
**researchers**, the \"**hybrid war\"** by its **content** consists of
the fact that it is not new for the **stories** of creating a
**war**]{.underline}, [does not need **branches** and is easily
described with the help of comprehension of the **historical
perspective**]{.underline}. In general, it can be said that the vast
majority of researchers agree that in the form of creating a modern war,
there are novices that need attention. The main question is how new this
phenomenon is in the framework of the historical perspective.

At present, the term \"hybrid war\" has a significant place in the
political dictionary. Over the past decade, a new military strategy has
become more relevant in the world political arena.

In the Euro-Atlantic space, the number of conflicts that are not part of
the Western category of war is growing. We can say that the analysis of
these conflicts show the modern idea of a hybrid war, in which we see an
intentional combination of forms of war to achieve strategic goals.

Modern American military analyst of conflicts, Frank Hoffman in various
forms of analysis of hybrid threats defines as follows: \"hybrid threats
if the enemy at the same time uses conventional weapons, irregular
tactics of terror-ism and criminal behavior, as well as a combination of
military operations to achieve political goals.\"5

Military experts of the United States during the XX century introduced
the concept of military planning together with the concept of \"hybrid
threats\" and, consequently, the new concept of \"hybrid wars\" - a form
of warfare that includes different composition, means, and level of
training and characteristic of forces - was created. However, what makes
a hybrid challenge the new phenomenon is the growing importance of
non-military means. This is a modern form of war, which focuses
primarily on achieving strategic goals without physical confrontation,
especially at the initial stage of the conflict.

Conventional (regular) warfare is, according to NATO's definition,
warfare where regular opponents, officially enlisted as states, are
engaged and regular tactics and activities are used, while respecting
international treaties, conventions and laws.

Irregular warfare, according to available NATO's definitions, represents
a warfare that denotes a form of conflict, where one or more
protagonists adopt irregular methods. Additionally, "irregular troops
are any combatants not formally enlisted in the armed forces of a
nation-state or other legally constituted entity." Other definitions
describe it as "a violent struggle among state and nonstate actors for
legitimacy and influence over the relevant populations. Irregular
warfare favours indirect and asymmetric approaches, though it may employ
the full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode an
adversary's power, influence, and will. "Moreover, irregular opponents
are unlikely to adhere to recognized treaties and international
conventions. On the other hand, they are likely to rely on local
support, fight in the place they live and they are often hard to
distinguish from local civilians. The irregular opponents' tactic will
often include undermining and eroding target's will and determination.
The tactic also includes avoiding regular decisive deployment of
national forces, and if necessary, then preferably under the terms and
circumstances chosen by the irregular opponents.

[Hybrid warfare]{.underline} in NATO's view is a violent conflict
applying combination and simultaneous use of conventional and irregular
warfare, involving both state and non-state actors, used adaptively in
pursuit of their objectives and not limited to physical battlefield or
territory. Each attack contains its own combinations and mutations of
the two and targets further aspects of state and society to undermine it
and reach its goals. Hybrid warfare can be employed in conflicts not
only by states and armed forces but also by a variety of actors beyond
the authority of states. (Such as terrorist or extremist groups.) [Even
though the **phenomenon** is **hardly new**, what is **new** and
**surprising** is the "scale of use and exploitation of **old tools** in
**new ways**."]{.underline}6

**\[Omit Fig. 1\]**

Hybrid methods of warfare, such as propaganda, deception, sabotage and
other non-military tactics have long been used to destabilize
adversaries. [What is new about attacks]{.underline} seen in recent
years [is their **speed**, **scale** and **intensity**, facilitated
by]{.underline} rapid [technological change and global
interconnectivity. **NATO** has a strategy on its role in countering
**hybrid warfare** and stands ready to defend the **Alliance** and all
Allies against **any threat**, whether **conventional** or
**hybrid**]{.underline}.

Highlights

\- [The]{.underline} primary [responsibility to respond to **hybrid
threats** or **attacks** rests with the **targeted
nation**]{.underline}.

\- [NATO is prepared to assist any **Ally** against **hybrid threats**
as part of **collective defense**. The Alliance]{.underline} has
[developed a **strategy** on]{.underline} its role [in countering
**hybrid warfare**]{.underline} to help address these threats.

\- In July 2018, NATO leaders agreed to set up counter-hybrid support
teams, which provide tailored targeted assistance to Allies upon their
request, in preparing for and responding to hybrid activities.

\- NATO is strengthening its coordination with partners, including the
European Union, in efforts to counter hybrid threats.

\- NATO's Joint Intelligence and Security Division has a hybrid analysis
branch, that helps improve situational awareness.

\- It also actively counters propaganda -- not with more propaganda, but
with facts -- online, on air and in print7 .

Hybrid threats include cyber-attacks, disinformation, economic pressure,
the destruction of non-permanent armed forces and the use of regular
forces, which is of military and non-military importance. [The most
important work of **NATO** is the **prevention** and **destruction** of
**hybrid attacks**]{.underline} (the scale and frequency of which has
greatly increased in recent years) and it does not matter whether it
comes from government or non-state bodies. Hybrid methods first blur the
boundary between peace and war and begin to be a problem for NATO. Since
2015, NATO has begun to fight with this warfare. To this end, NATO will
prepare the Alliance and Allies to the extent that they can provide it
all. For constant readiness, NATO continually gathers, exchanges and
evaluates information to ensure any necessary activity. An integrated
intelligence and security unit at NATO Headquarters assists this
process. The hybrid analysis department provides maximum information on
hybrid threats. Together with the abovementioned, [NATO]{.underline}
also [supports allied in]{.underline} civic [preparedness]{.underline}
and response [to chemical, biological, radiological and
nuclear]{.underline} (CBRN) [phenomena; protects critical
infrastructure]{.underline}, strategic communications, [and energy
security, combats terrorism, and]{.underline} also [provides cyber
defense]{.underline}, which is very important. To implement all of the
above, it is very important to conduct trainings and checks, which will
make the fight against hybrid threats much effective

NATO can hold up hybrid threats much faster and more agile, and each
time it improves preparedness for the fight and the decision-making
process and the management of defense and control. It also shows that
the Alliance is also strong in political and military efficiency and in
a quick decision-making process. In the event that the struggle becomes
impracticable, NATO, with its speed and flexibility, at any time and in
any place protects its allies from any attacks.

To strengthen and improve the fight against hybrid threats, NATO
continues to cooperate with Finland, Sweden, Ukraine and the European
Union. The European Union and NATO have especially strengthened their
cooperation against cyber-attacks and are successfully conducting this
process.

For better experience, centres of excellence (international research
centres) provide the alliance with more knowledge at the national or
multinational level.

In October 2017, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, together with
the European Union Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security
Policy / Vice President of the European Commission Federica Mogherini,
opened the European Centre of Excellence for Combating Hybrid Threats in
Finland, which supports 14 countries to improve their capabilities and
preparedness to counter hybrid threats8 .

New Security Challenges: The Emergence of 'Hybrid Threats' as Challenges
to Peace and Security

Multimodal, low intensity, [kinetic as well as non-kinetic **threats**
to international peace and security, including **cyber war**,
**asymmetric conflict** scenarios, **global terrorism**,
piracy,]{.underline} transnational [organized crime]{.underline},
demographic challenges, [resource security, retrenchment from
**globalization**, and]{.underline} the [proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction were identified and labelled by NATO as '**Hybrid
Threats**']{.underline}, as threats 'posed by adversaries, with the
ability to simultaneously employ conventional and non-conventional means
adaptively in pursuit of their objectives'

Having identified these threats, NATO undertook work on creating a
comprehensive conceptual framework, a Capstone Concept, which was to
provide a legal framework for identifying and categorizing such threats
within the wider frame of possible multi-stakeholder responses. In 2011,
NATO's Allied Command Transformation (ACT) supported by the U.S. Joint
Forces Command Joint Irregular Warfare Centre (USJFCOM JIWC) and the
U.S. National Defense University (NDU) conducted specialized workshops
related to 'Assessing Emerging Security Challenges in the Globalized
Environment (Countering Hybrid Threats \[CHT\]) Experiment'.

These workshops took place in Brussels, Belgium, and Tallinn, Estonia,
and aimed at identifying possible threats and discussing some key
implications when countering such risks and challenges. The findings of
the workshops were published in the ACT's final report and
recommendations in 2011.

Hybrid threats faced by NATO and its non-military partners require a
comprehensive approach allowing a wide spectrum of responses, be it
kinetic and non-kinetic by military and non-military actors. Such a
comprehensive response will have to be in partnership with other
stakeholders, such as international and regional organizations as well
as representatives of business and commerce. However, due to a lack of
financial resources in general, and an absence of the political will to
create necessary 'smart defence' capabilities among its member states,
NATO decided in June 2012 to cease the work on CHT at its organizational
level while encouraging its member states and associated NATO Excellence
Centres to continue working on hybrid threats9 .

At present, [information warfare is the **main component** of the
**war**]{.underline}, which means influencing the masses through access
to the media, getting support for some idea and making the client\'s
policy. Information warfare often includes informative, propagandistic,
psychological, and cyber components and the characteristic of the
\"hybrid war\" is the use of integrated financial resources, material
resources and hidden military means.

A new type of war in the North Atlantic alliance, [the \"**hybrid
war**\"]{.underline} that unites all elements of a new strategy, is
called tactics, when military facilities are not used. The war [contains
elements of **propaganda** and **disinformation**, as well
as]{.underline} forced use of [**economic pressure** and **Special
Forces**]{.underline}. This kind of war is referred to as \"soft
power\". Today, the main component of the war is \"informational war\",
which means influencing the masses through access to the media, getting
support for some idea and making a client\'s policy. \"Informative war\"
often combines information-propaganda, psychological and cybercrime.

[A vivid example]{.underline} of such a conflict [is]{.underline} the
[Russian aggression against]{.underline} [**Ukraine**. The appearance of
Russian militaries in Crimea without the **marking signs**]{.underline}
(\"hidden faces, hidden management and controls\") directly
[means]{.underline} the [secretive use of **Special
Forces**,]{.underline} which is [one of the main elements of
this]{.underline} kind of [war]{.underline}. The use of such forces,
which do not have any marks, in military opera- tions, allows Moscow to
carry out an active campaign of rejection, aiming to mask its military
intervention. Russian television is actively using militarist propaganda
to mitigate and justify aggression

[It is worth noting the **cyber-attack** on **Ukraine**. Russia\'s
actions against Ukraine are a good example of how cyber operations can
be **integrated**]{.underline} [into conventional **military
operations**]{.underline}. [Cyber-attack]{.underline} and anti-state
propaganda [campaigns]{.underline} of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict
[were carried out by DDoS attacks against **Ukrainian
media**]{.underline} [and government organizations, as well as on
NATO]{.underline} and NGO sites. In addition, Russian communications
intelligence used the data on the Internet to determine the location of
the Ukrainian military units in eastern Ukraine.

Former NATO advisor on security issues, General Frank Van Kappen, was
one of the Western analysts who described the Russian-Ukrainian conflict
as a \"hybrid war\" on 26 April 2014.

It is possible to say that the \"hybrid war\" theory of the
Russian-Ukraine conflict has been created. This type of war has already
been recognized as \"hybrid war\" - one of the major challenges,
confirming a new strategy against the threats by NATO in December 2015.
As NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at a meeting of the NATO
Foreign Ministers in Brussels, the Alliance will agree with the EU in
implementing a new strategy, as the hybrid war contains both military
and civilian elements. The emergence of a hybrid war as a new form of
conflict fundamentally alters the existing landscape and provides many
questions about the possibilities of security systems10 .

Finally, we can say that \"[Information War]{.underline}\" [is one of
the most **important threats** of the **XXI century**]{.underline},
[which threatens **international security**]{.underline} in addition to
internal state relations. This can be used that support the recent
history of the Russian Federation from the \"information war\" as the
use of technology (2008) and Ukraine (2015-2016 years) against. Briefly,
let\'s review the results of intelligence impact on the national
security system of Georgia in the summer of 2008. Analysis of events
allows us to assume that its northern neighbour used not only
traditional ways of attack - by land, sea and air, but also implied the
fourth, relatively new, but the most effective way of attack in terms of
information, including cyber-space. According to the report published by
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia in August 2009, the Russian
citizens and their sympathizers on 7-16 August 2008 carried out a
coordinated attack that destroyed dozens of important web pages,
including the web pages of the President, Defence Minister, National
Bank of Georgia and other state agencies. Turns out, that cyber- space
protection (including the threat of a timely response to the propaganda)
in terms of intelligence and counterintelligence measures completely
collapsed.

The stability of national security depends much on each individual
component of international security. One of the major and general
components in the world today are considered the danger coming from
asymmetric threats and hybrid war, which seriously threaten the national
security and strategic interests of the states. [The world
faces]{.underline} a number of [challenges that cannot be **solved**
without a **united effort**]{.underline}. Therefore, with the purpose of
prevention of similar threats and minimization of the risks, [it is
necessary for states to take]{.underline} appropriate [steps toward
**cooperation**]{.underline}, [where **collective security** is granted
with]{.underline} big significance and the necessity for forming
**[alliances]{.underline}**, increasing the effectiveness of
international organizations, defending the international security system
and protecting of global security occur. [NATO plays an **important
role** in tackling]{.underline} existing [threats]{.underline}, has a
strategic concept and takes preventive measures to combat threats. [NATO
has a variety of approaches]{.underline}, which are brought forward in
its new conceptual documents, [to ease]{.underline} the [existing
challenges]{.underline} and threats.

Security is especially important in the era of globalization, when
economization, democratization, informatization creates unprecedented
opportunities for development, but at the same time makes the
international relations system more vulnerable against challenges such
as terrorism, weapons of mass destruction to use.

Conclusion

The increasing popularity of the use of asymmetric threats and hybrid
operations in more and more parts of conflict areas rise questions how
to adopt traditional Western conventional warfare so that it is able to
face new challenges of the 21st century. The future conflicts will
however no longer be possible to categorise only as conventional or
irregular, state or non-state. NATO has mechanisms, means to combat
actively asymmetric, and hybrid threats. The world is facing global
threats, risks and challenges that make international security
vulnerable with the development of new technologies. The development of
technologies in the XXI century has brought many benefits to the
society, but in terms of intelligence and \"informational war\" for its
implementation, it has led to many threats. The security trends and new
challenges play a major role in the establishment of a new system of
international relations. After the Cold War, NATO\'s successful
transformation and regulation of non-traditional security threats is the
basic prerequisite for the globalization of the international role of
the alliance.

Asymmetric threats and hybrid warfare affect the global security
environment, which makes the global security environment vulnerable to
modern threats. Despite global changes in the world, NATO has managed to
establish peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area. After the end
of the Cold War, when the main enemy of the Warsaw military bloc was
disintegrated, there was the illusion that NATO had exhausted its
function and could have dissolved. NATO underwent a transformation in
the post-Cold War period, which significantly strengthened the Alliance
and helped stabilize the balance of the power in the world. Today, NATO
successfully cope with new challenges and threats of the 21st century
and makes a significant contribution to the international security
system.

### AT: Hybrid War K\-\--Perm Do Both

#### "Hybrid threats" bring criticism of [modern power]{.underline} into the [open]{.underline}.

Conclusion

[This article]{.underline} has [brought the notion of **OS** to bear on
the]{.underline} thus far heavily policy-oriented **[hybrid warfare
literature]{.underline}**. [[As **hybrid threats** epitomise
**ontological insecurity**]{.mark}, [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} and the
EU[['s]{.mark}]{.underline} synergistic [[discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}
and emerging practice [on [countering the **hybrid menace** emerges as
an attempt at]{.mark} the [**institutionalisation**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} their organisational
**[[OS-seeking]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Tackling the hybrid challenges of
the day in apparent unison further provides NATO and the EU a silver
lining of a tightened cooperation between the two organisations. Further
research could map the complex interactions between the OS-seeking
strategies of these distinct intergovernmental institutions and their
member states/societies with regard to countering hybrid warfare. It
would be interesting to investigate, for example, how the traditional
lines of division within the European community along the more
Russia-friendly and Russia-wary countries might tap into the
institutional dynamics of hybrid threat management of the EU and NATO.
Moreover, the newly established special sub-institutions to confront
hybrid threats within the EU along with the organisationally
unaffiliated Centre of Excellence could themselves develop their own
identities, OS drives and placating routines, potentially generating
organisational fragmentation and inter-agency tensions instead of
bolstering the OS of the Union as a whole (cf. Steele 2017).

With regard to [the [**ethical drawbacks** of]{.mark}]{.underline}
effective **[[hybrid]{.mark} threat [management]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
such an endeavour [[point]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[at the]{.underline}
[problematic prospect of compromising the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**already [fuzzy distinction]{.mark}** [between **politics** and
**war**]{.mark} --]{.underline} as [[according to]{.mark} the **[hybrid
war]{.mark}fare [paradigm]{.mark}**[, all politics]{.mark} becomes
[reduce]{.mark}d [to the]{.mark}]{.underline} potential [[**build-up
phase** for a]{.mark} full-blown
**[confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In that sense, hybrid warfare
is close to the criteria of "minimal wars, which consist in merely
threatening the enemy with negotiations held in reserve" (Clausewitz
1976, 604, emphasis in the original). [The]{.underline} alleged
"[minimality]{.underline}" [of such a]{.underline} way of
[warfare]{.underline} nonetheless [has]{.underline} considerable
[potential to induce **broad** and **deep securitisation**
of]{.underline} various [public policy]{.underline} processes in the
Western societies and their supranational organisations in question.
Hybrid warfare and the emerging institutionalisation of its countering
practices highlight the paradox of defending democratic security
communities, as the efficacy of such defence might in fact be
detrimental to some of the core organising principles of democracy.

[[An **alt**]{.mark}**ernative** approach would be to [argue]{.mark}
that **[hybrid war]{.mark}fare**[, and]{.mark} the [**countering
practices** it is generating]{.mark}, have]{.underline} simply
[[brought]{.mark} **the nature** of **the [modern power]{.mark}** out

[must be understood as a **secret**]{.mark} **form of [war]{.mark}**[,

### AT: Hybrid War K\-\--AT: Terminological Ambiguity

#### Hybrid war is [not ambiguous]{.underline}, and there isn't a [universal formula]{.underline} to describe its contents.

Since the early 2000s, the rise of the 'hybrid warfare' term can hardly
go unnoticed. From a new term in U.S. military and operational code,
introduced with the 2005 National Defence Strategy Review, to a
consolidating phenomenon in strategic studies and a proliferating
buzzword in public and political debates, especially in Europe, the
notion of ['hybrid warfare' seems to be living a life of its
own]{.underline}. Coined by Hoffman (2009) as a way to describe modern
fanatical fighting styles, supported by new technologies and deployed in
the shadow of state agency (no full deployments of army, no uniforms --
and no need to obey the laws of armed conflict), [the]{.underline}
'hybrid warfare' [term is]{.underline} now [used]{.underline} and abused
[in many possible ways -- including]{.underline} the [cases in which it
is]{.underline} misleadingly [equated with]{.underline} the idea of
['hybrid war']{.underline}, understood as something less than war. [The
lack of clarity]{.underline} as to what is what [is]{.underline}
particularly [disturbing as the term(s) **virally spread**]{.underline}
in public and political debates as well as academia. Hardly any security
journal or a strategic studies event save an effort in addressing the
'complexity' of the notion. [Some find it **fancy** and **meaningless**,
some]{.underline} -- [revolutionary but **evasive** in]{.underline} its
[conceptualization]{.underline} (cf. e.g. a critique of the literature
by Johnson (2018)). [The term seems to be **broad** and
**flexible**]{.underline} enough to encompass many things at once -- and
different things in different contexts, wherefore it is often used as a
catch-all term for all non-linear threats. And [yet, the idea is
**rather simple**: modern technology]{.underline} has [enhanced
the]{.underline} known [modes of **warfare** as]{.underline} well as [it
enabled]{.underline} the [discovery of new **battlefields**, **methods**
and '**fighters'**]{.underline} -- beyond armed troops. NATO's 2014
Wales Summit declaration described 'hybrid warfare threats' as 'a wide
range of overt and covert military, paramilitary and civilian measures
\[that\] are employed in highly integrated design' (NATO 2014). As such,
[they 'blend the lethality of **state conflict** with]{.underline} the
fanatical and protracted fervor of **[irregular warfare']{.underline}**
(Hoffman 2009: 37). The notion is therefore not constrained to a
particular set of fighting methods or a particular agent of war -- it
can equally be deployed by any state and non-state actor and will hardly
be deployed in precisely the same manner twice -- and, thus, can hardly
be 'calculated'. Critiquing Fox and Rossow's (2017) attempt at 'making
sense of Russian hybrid warfare' on their sixteen-page working paper
published by the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare, Ricks (2017) laments
that '\[t\]hey offer a series of unsatisfying summaries of other
experts' unsatisfying claims, and come up with an unwieldy version of
"hybrid war = information operations + unconventional + cyber +
conventional, spread out along an axis of covert and overt operations"'.
This can be said about much of the literature on the subject trying to
find and 'patent' [the universal formula of **hybrid
warfare**]{.underline} applicable in any context and in any part of the
world -- which [does not exist, **of course**: every instance of
this]{.underline} evolving warfare [campaign has]{.underline} its
[specific **sources**, **strategic** and **operational goals**,
**battlefield(s)** and **tactics**]{.underline} -- all within a
particular hybrid war strategy.

[What can be said with]{.underline} (a greater) [**certainty**, is that
this]{.underline} twenty-first century [art of warfare is
**multi-modal**, **multi-theatric** and **multi-agential**.]{.underline}
Hybrid wars begin long before the first shots are fired, if at all.
[With the use of]{.underline} both overt and especially covert means
such as external financial and organizational support of [democratic
tools]{.underline} (referenda, elections, other public participation and
influence campaigns) [or less 'visible']{.underline} information or
**[cyber operations]{.underline}** in target countries, [the challenge
is to]{.underline} instantly and [firmly attribute an
**action**]{.underline}, or a result thereof, t[o a hostile foreign
agency]{.underline}. Both public debates, policymaking processes,
digital transactions or physical battlespace may [become]{.underline}
theatres of warfare in hybrid strategies. In hybrid warfare,
[conventional]{.underline} military [operations are not excluded --
they]{.underline} just [form the **latest operation level**. Before
that]{.underline} moment[, the place of]{.underline} uniformed [soldiers
is taken by soldiers **without insignia**]{.underline} (special forces,
private mercenaries), [astroturfed **irregulars**]{.underline}, troll
and bot 'armies', [cyber hackers,]{.underline} criminal
[racketeers,]{.underline} captured or corrupt [elites,
**propagandists**]{.underline}, psychologists [and]{.underline} by
manipulated **[media]{.underline}**. In their 2012 book, Williamson
Murray and Peter R. Mansoor define hybrid warfare as a 'conflict
involving a combination of conventional military forces and irregulars
(guerrillas, insurgents, and terrorists), which could include both state
and nonstate actors, aimed at achieving a common political purpose'
(Mansoor 2012: 2). Thereby, '\[i\]rregular forces need not be centrally
directed, although in many cases they form part of a coherent strategy
used to oppose an invader or occupation force' (Mansoor 2012: 3). The
range of ['hybrid actors']{.underline} is, too, context-dependent and
may [include]{.underline} any combination from the variety of
interpenetrated state and non-state agents -- from [**insurgent** or
**terrorist networks**, organized crime groups, **social
groups**]{.underline} (such as clans, tribes or ethnic groups), and
ideologically or religiously motivated organizations, all of which may
be backed covertly, or overtly, by states and/or legitimate businesses
(Schroefl and Kaufman 2014: 867).

#### Our securitization was good AND no generic links

Ethics of Securitization

As discussed in the literature review, [[securitization]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} most [often [discussed as a
'**negative'**]{.mark}]{.underline} [concept]{.underline} for several
reasons. First of all, securitization argues that the normal democratic
procedures for decision makers be abandoned in favor of a streamlined
decision-making process handled by a small elite that dictate policy on
security related issues. [Critics assert that securitization
is]{.underline} something largely [inconsistent with the openness and
accountability that]{.underline} [liberal democratic systems
value]{.underline}, [therefore]{.underline} securitization [is something
'negative' to be avoided]{.underline} in societies that place true
importance on these values. [But [what if **the issue**]{.mark} **being
securitized** [is a **direct threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} those very [democratic procedures themselves. Are there
issues [that **deserve to be securitized**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[for the **common good**]{.underline}, [and can government
policies have a **positive impact on society** when these issues are
**securitized?**]{.underline}

[Experts on **disinformation**]{.underline} [warn of the **dire
potential** that such **propaganda** can have on a society]{.underline},
and argue that liberal democracies are especially vulnerable to them.
New technologies have made the 21st century into a completely different
type of information space than its predecessor. [The internet has
decentralized and democratized the flow of information]{.underline} to
the point where somebody sitting on a laptop at home may be able to make
the same impact with a blog as a major newspaper with an article. [With
less institutional control and traditional media gatekeeping on the flow
of information, the internet is a **truly democratic
platform**]{.underline}.148 These democratic processes; freedom of
information, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and free
elections; are precisely what make liberal democracies so vulnerable to
disinformation and propaganda. With knowledge of these asymmetric
vulnerabilities[, the Kremlin **consciously aims** "to **take
advantage** of the **free flow of information** in a democratic society,
the **effect of that information on public opinion**, and the
**electoral mechanisms**]{.underline} [through which public opinion
determines a country's leadership]{.underline}."149

[One foundation of a democratic society is the ability to make decisions
in the public forum **based on shared truth**.]{.underline} When voters
go to the polls, they may make a judgement on which candidate or which
proposal they favor based on the information that they have consumed.
Traditionally, they may differ on what course of action may be the best
way to handle a problem, but there is an agreed upon reality that is a
matter of fact; it is shared. [Disinformation, from Russia and other
actors hostile to the West, **promotes falsehoods** to the point where
society **cannot have a shared truth**.]{.underline} Imagine four people
each with a different source of news. One reads the New York Times, one
watches Fox News, one reads Breitbart, and one watches RT. Each one of
these people will not only come to radically different conclusions about
what solutions are best for society, but also about what the basic facts
of reality are in the first place. One person may be out on the streets
protesting the disappearance and rape of a young Russian girl by Muslim
migrants, while the next person may be aware that the story is a
complete falsehood that never happened to begin with. [[Russian
efforts]{.mark} in the EU [show]{.mark} that [these situations **are
not**]{.mark} **a hysterical [fear-mongering]{.mark} reaction to new
technologies**]{.underline} and new sources of information,
[[but]{.mark} that they are **already a [reality]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[Disinfo]{.mark}rmation [creates]{.mark} a situation where people can
have **[opposing realities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [because the
information they consume is **so radically different**]{.underline}
[from that of their neighbor.]{.underline} [**[Critical theory]{.mark}**
in international relations **[warns]{.mark}** that
[securitization]{.mark} **[subverts]{.mark} democratic
[decision-making]{.mark} processes**]{.underline}, [[but
**disinfo**]{.mark}**rmation** [**destroys** these]{.mark} very
democratic [processes]{.mark}]{.underline} that are so fundamental for
liberal democratic societies to function the way they are intended. It
is impossible to imagine normal democratic processes solving these types
of problems when those processes are being eroded by propaganda to the
point where Western societies may no longer have normal democratic
processes if this trend continues. In order to maintain these democratic
norms, [securitization may be a **necessary**]{.underline} [process,
even a 'positive' concept that can yield positive results]{.underline}
and protect the democratic values that have propelled the European
project into existence.

From the perspective of states, it is difficult to see why they would
not wish to securitize the issue of Russian disinformation more. States
tend to place an emphasis on matters of physical and territorial
security over all else, which is why issues such as nuclear weapons, or
rising military power in China, or international terrorism are
prioritized in terms of security policy. States' desire for physical
security explains why these issues tend to be some of the most
securitized political issues, with decisions made regarding military
policy in Afghanistan by military panels rather than public referendums.
Walt, arguing from the realist perspective, argues that states "place
particular emphasis on the preservation of the state's territorial
integrity and the physical safety of its inhabitants." 150 Material harm
is of the utmost importance while more ethereal issues, like democratic
procedures, freedom of the information space, and societal resilience
towards propaganda are not prioritized in the same way. Disinformation
has threatened some of the building blocks of democratic societies
throughout the EU, and if these democratic systems fail, it isn't
difficult to imagine that physical security would come under threat as
well. In the case of Spain, the issue of the Spanish government's
territorial sovereignty over Catalonia was attacked by Russian
disinformation, exacerbating the political wounds of the independence
referendum. The disinformation campaign questioned Spain's fundamental
right to exist in its current form, yet Spain did not place the
integrity of their media space as an important security issue despite
this. There needs to be a shift in the importance and value that
European democracies place on the fundamental democratic principles that
allow their system to flourish. They should be prioritized with the same
importance that states place on more traditional measures of power.
Securitization of disinformation with the liberal democratic system and
democratic processes themselves as the referent object, has the
potential to have a more 'positive' outcome than emphasis on hard power,
or immigration, or other issues that contribute to the 'negative'
conception of securitization.

Successful Securitization and Societal Resilience

In the case studies it is clear that [some European countries have
securitized Russian disinformation while some have not.]{.underline}
Namely, the United Kingdom and Lithuania have successfully securitized
disinformation, while Spain, Germany, and the supranational institutions
of the EU have not securitized disinformation. Those that have not
securitized, have identified Russian disinformation as a perceived
security threat and have several securitizing actors currently at play.
The potential audiences of the securitizing speech acts, those within
the security apparatus, NGOs, think-tanks, and even the wider public of
these countries have accepted that Russian disinformation is a security
threat that warrants greater action by their governments. Thus far, they
have not taken measures that could by any means be considered
extraordinary, having allocated a relatively small number of resources
and minimal effort towards combating disinformation, and therefore
cannot be considered to have securitized the issue. These countries, and
the EU, are possibly in the early stages of the process of
securitization, though this does not necessarily mean that they will
complete the process by taking more extraordinary measures against
disinformation. In fact, there could be a reversal and disinformation
could slip back into the realm of normal politics and become
desecuritized.

Some [clear trends emerge in the countries who have **successfully
securitized disinformation**]{.underline}. First[, propaganda narratives
have a **weaker effect on society** when disinformation **has been
securitized**,]{.underline} [**failing to have their desired
impact**]{.underline} and cause major rifts in the public. They also
show that [securitization of disinformation is possible **without**
implicitly **violating** democratic norms of freedom of speech and open
access to information]{.underline}. This becomes clear in looking at the
contrast between Lithuania's countermeasures against disinformation
compared to those of Germany and Spain. In Germany, the Lisa case was
dealt with almost exclusively via the normal criminal and legal
channels, with the police investigation into Lisa's accusations of
kidnap and rape by migrants and police handling of most public
statements related to the controversy. 151 They have begun to enact
minor laws that aim at punishing hate speech and disinformation when
posted on popular social media platforms as well.152 Spanish authorities
have started task forces devoted to alerting the national government
when disinformation narratives start to dominate a story online. 153
Spanish and German officials at the higher levels of national authority
in their respective foreign and defense departments gave minimal
statements regarding the controversies, and have preferred to continue
dealing with Russia through dialogue over more overt confrontation that
could complicate communication. Both Germany and Spain have taken a more
reactive approach to countering disinformation, choosing to deal with it
on a case-by-case basis as an incident unfolds.

Lithuania has taken similar messages to alert national authorities on
dangerous narratives as they develop online, but it has also taken
extraordinary measures that encompass a broader scope. The Lithuanian
government has supported efforts at every level of society; political,
economic, educational, and cultural. 154 Their wide spread programs
focus not only on dealing with each case as it emerges, but also on
strengthening the fundamental resilience of society at the source
through teaching media literacy in secondary schools, funding Russian
language media for the susceptible minority group, and sensitizing the
public to the dangers of propaganda by making disinformation a security
issue linked to the physical security and existence of the state.155
Their bans on Russian media channels during disinformation campaigns,
while possibly construed as violations of a free press, are necessary to
prevent media from spreading out right falsehoods. The news media, both
Lithuanian and Russian language, should be held accountable and has a
responsibility to act as a gatekeeper of the truth. Many media channels
in Lithuania have voluntarily chosen to follow such a route, choosing
not to report on 'fake' news stories that can be detrimental to society
by becoming 'real' news through regurgitation by legitimate media
outlets. It is important not to confuse the right of free speech of an
individual with that of a news organization with ties to a foreign
country, and such acts should not be considered violations of democratic
norms when it comes to protecting the fundamental values of democracy.

[The **countermeasures** taken by a country]{.underline} undoubtedly
[play a role in the **impact** disinformation narratives may have in
that country. With Lithuania's '**successful' securitization** of
disinformation]{.underline}, [**fake stories** and attempts at
**propaganda** have often **fallen on deaf ears**]{.underline}, with
little real success. [Lithuania's overarching, comprehensive strategy at
countering disinformation is the **reason** the NATO rape
allegations]{.underline} **[failed to cause a large
disruption]{.underline}** [in the news cycle.]{.underline}156 [This
**strong contrast** is seen with Germany, where the story of a rape by
migrants of a young Russian girl caused an **uproar** and **led to
protests in Berlin**]{.underline} [and a **diplomatic row with
Moscow**]{.underline}. 157 Spain also fell short, with Russian
disinformation exacerbating a contentious independence referendum in
Catalonia and influencing public opinion at home and abroad on the
status of Catalan autonomy. [[Government policies that **fail to
securitize** ]{.mark}**disinformation** and **alert
society**]{.underline} [to the **dangers of propaganda**]{.underline}
[[lead to **false stories** having **explosive
consequences**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Both Spain and Germany's strategies of dealing with disinformation
narratives as they arise is simply not effective enough. The state can
spend time and resources trying to discredit every fake news story that
finds its way to the public forum, but there will always be one to take
its place. It is like fire prevention; a fire alarm can be an important
part of fire prevention, alerting the fire department to come extinguish
a blaze. But there are more important measures as well, such as building
structures with fire resistant materials, or teaching people what to do
in case of a fire. These types of continuous measures, like the policies
Lithuania pursues, make society more resilient and prevent
disinformation from causing a fire in the first place.

[Policies aimed at improving societal resilience towards disinformation
are being utilized in other countries with successful outcomes as
well]{.underline}. Latvia uses a sweeping media literacy program from an
early age to improve critical thinking in its citizens.158 Finland, a
country with a long history of hostility with Russia, uses similar
programs, emphasizing not only the need to publicly correct false
narratives, but also the importance of creating a positive
counternarrative to disinformation that is repeatedly applied to offer
an alternative vision.159 [These countermeasures **only appear** in
countries that have **securitized disinformation**]{.underline}, as
Finland and Latvia have similar histories as Lithuania and treat
disinformation in similar terms, and they are much more promising than
government authorities attempting to play catchup with internet trolls
and false stories.

Internationalization of Countermeasures

Another key conclusion comes from the other [case of successful
securitization in the United Kingdom. The UK, in its **securitization of
disinformation**]{.underline} [following the assassination attempt on
Sergei Skripal, **internationalized the threat**]{.underline} [by
creating a set of countermeasures]{.underline} [that could be
implemented **along with its allies**]{.underline}. The UK successfully
convinced 20 allies to expel Russian diplomats in a coordinated effort
at punishing Putin's regime for the incident and the subsequent
disinformation surrounding it.160 [Theresa May, as a securitizing actor,
not only convinced her public in the UK of disinformation as a security
threat,]{.underline} [but **convinced the international
community**]{.underline} [that such behavior "**threatens the security
of us all**]{.underline}." 161 Compared with the minimal Spanish
attempts at coordinating counter disinformation at the EU level, and
German attempts to keep the Lisa Case under the authority of Berlin's
police department[, British efforts at securitizing their incident by
bringing it to the **attention of the international community** and
launching a **unified response** were **highly
successful.**]{.underline}

This lesson of internationalization should be critical for the EU to
deal with disinformation. [[Securitization needs to take place]{.mark}
not only at the **national level** of member]{.underline} [states, but
also [at the **supranational level**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}of
the EU as an institution. The EU itself is under threat of Russian
disinformation just as much as individual member states, with experts
warning of further regionalization of Europe and the EU after Brexit. In
this critical time for the continued existence of the EU, [the threat of
disinformation "[requires]{.mark} new [international instruments]{.mark}
to manage it." 162 Thus far, member states have shown a preference for
taking **individual routes**]{.underline} in order to deal with
disinformation. [The importance **of joint initiatives**]{.underline}
[could be especially important during **elections**]{.underline}, a time
in which the ability of national and EU authorities to cooperate is
critical. During the European elections of 2019 for example, consisting
of four days of simultaneous elections across 28 individual member
states, "the failure of one government to properly mitigate
disinformation efforts threatens the credibility of the entire electoral
process." 163 This problem of coordination cannot be understated, as
some countries do not even have their own systems in place to monitor
disinformation, allowing "local and national actors to spread fake news
more freely" and leaving these countries defenseless against
propaganda.164

[It is essential]{.underline} for the EU [to act as a
**bloc**]{.underline} [and start **joint initiatives**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} **[counter disinformation]{.underline}**. [Russian
efforts]{.underline}, as shown in the case studies, are not exclusive to
one particular area of Europe, but **[threaten all member
states]{.underline}**. Issues Russia chooses to target; the migrant
crisis, espionage, the use of chemical weapons in a member state, the
solidarity and legitimacy of the NATO, and even the territorial
sovereignty of some countries; should alarm every single member of the
EU. These issues are not unique to one country, but they are issues that
countries even outside of the EU are currently confronting. Europe is
targeted as a bloc, and therefore it should respond as a bloc. Such a
response, as seen in with the UK's diplomatic expulsion, has a larger
impact as a bloc rather than individually. Division will only encourage
more provocations. [Acting on a **unified front** in securitizing
disinformation and reacting with countermeasures will do much more
[to]{.mark} potentially **[deter Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} from
continuing down the same path in its relations with Europe. The EU needs
to stop hesitating, and start throwing its full weight on the economic,
political, and informational fronts.

'Positive' Securitization

The two [trends discussed in the sections above also show that
[disinfo]{.mark}rmation [can be securitized **without**]{.mark} **wide
[violations of democratic norms]{.mark}** and]{.underline}
**[exclusionary tactics]{.underline}** [towards Russian minorities in
Europe]{.underline}. [By arguing for securitization, this paper is not
arguing that democratic principles should be **thrown out** in favor of
**extraordinary measures**]{.underline} [that subvert the democratic
process]{.underline}, indeed the democratic process is of the utmost
importance because these principles are the referent object of a
European push to securitize disinformation. [And according to
polls]{.underline} in all of the countries involved in the case studies
and the EU as a whole, [the general public agrees that disinformation
**constitutes a security threat**]{.underline} that could be detrimental
to liberal democratic norms. Efforts like media literacy, cooperation
with news organizations, and comprehensive strategies that deal with
disinformation at every level of society are still extraordinary without
necessarily violating democratic norms. These [[policies]{.mark} [aim to
**sensitize the public** ]{.mark}**to
disinformation**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [They **do [not]{.mark}** aim
[to]{.mark} **[monitor]{.mark} the public [in a surveillance
state]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[and]{.underline} **[punish
individual views]{.underline}** that are unfavorable to European states.
[On the other hand, these policies are not afraid to prevent large news
outlets from **spreading lies** that harm the ability to make democratic
decisions **based on shared truths.**]{.underline} [Diplomatic expulsion
and unprecedented international cooperation on information issues are
extraordinary]{.underline} [measures taken **without abuse of state
power**]{.underline} [as in the **War on Terror**]{.underline}.
[Policies that aim to provide alternative news sources to Russian
speaking minorities in Europe **are not** **exclusionary
'othering**]{.underline},' [but are **inclusive**]{.underline} [and
offer a **broader**, **diverse**, and]{.underline} **[more
positive]{.underline}** [view]{.underline} [of the Russian diaspora than
as a monolithic fifth-column prone to side with Moscow and Putin's
regime over their new homes.]{.underline} These policies need to be
inclusive to mitigate the risk of disinformation and the subsequent
disillusion with European governments. A conscious, just policy of
securitization of disinformation must take democratic principles,
inclusion of diverse viewpoints, and the treatment of Russian minorities
into account while avoiding the misuse of state power in order to
succeed.

\*IPb= informatsionnoe protivoborstvo=Russian information warfare

While traditional military measures are still considered the hallmark of
inter-state conflict, [[Russian **strategic thinking**]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [increasingly
**[highlighting]{.mark}**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [**[strategic
importance]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[non-military]{.underline}**, **[[asymmetric]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[and]{.underline} **[indirect]{.underline}** [[measures]{.underline},
[including]{.underline}]{.mark} military and non-military
**[[IPb]{.mark} operations]{.underline}**, [in its **multi-domain
approach**]{.underline} [to conflict in the 21 st century]{.underline}.
[According to the Chief of the Russian General Staff]{.underline},
Valeriy [Gerasimov]{.underline}, [IPb is the **only means**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[conflict resolution]{.underline}** which spans
across all stages of modern inter-state conflict and encompasses both
military and non-military means (see Figure 2).23 The complexity of its
role further increases during the initial stages of kinetic conflict
operations. Reflecting a desire to minimize military confrontation
during these stages, the ratio of non-military and military measures is
described as 4:1.24

The novelty of Gerasimov's perception of modern conflict (often
described as the Gerasimov Doctrine) and the role of information in
conflict resolution should not be overstated.25 The literature on
Russian IPb emphasizes that contemporary [information operations
demonstrate that "the Kremlin is falling on a time-honoured strategy in
its propaganda war."26 Indeed, Russian leaders have operationalized
information for strategic purposes since at least the Revolution. The
Soviet government developed and systematically applied active measures
and deception techniques that were intensive, persistent in times of war
and peace, worldwide in scope, and centrally coordinated in a way that
was not mirrored by Western governmen]{.underline}ts.27 Informational
psychological operations were coordinated by the political leadership
and implemented by the state security apparatus, specifically the KGB
(and its predecessors) and to a lesser extent the GRU, both domestically
and internationally.28 Initially these operations were orchestrated on
an ad-hoc basis, but by the late 1970s, an institutionalized system for
coordinating and implementing them had been fully established. These
overt and covert, non-military and military information operations were
referred to by Soviet intelligence services as active measures. In 1982,
the CIA described active measures as "an unconventional adjunct to
traditional diplomacy. [They are **quintessentially** an **offensive
instrument** of Soviet policy]{.underline}."29

The 1970s saw an organizational restructuring within the KGB and CPSU
that signified an increase in the perceived strategic importance of
active measures. According to a Ladislav Bittman, a former active
measures agent for Czechoslovak intelligence (one of the most successful
and loyal satellites of the KGB) who defected to the West, this
organizational change was the result of an evolution in the perceived
strategic importance of active measures that unfolded in three stages
after World War II.30 In the first stage (1945-1948), active measures
were characterized by an ideological emphasis on communism. In the
second stage (1948-1959), the Soviet Union sought to increase the
efficacy of active measures by making them appear more objective. To
achieve this, the Soviet Union dialed back the overt ideological
emphasis of its propaganda and used communist front organizations and
Soviet satellite intelligence services to conceal its role in
coordinating active measures.

Bittman notes that the Soviet government valued active measures as
secondary to intelligence collection in the first and second stages and
that this hierarchy of values visibly reversed in the third stage, which
began in 1959 with the establishment of a department of active measures
within the First Chief Directorate of the KGB. Many Soviet satellite
intelligence services soon established similar departments which carried
out orders from the KGB in addition to their own operations. Throughout
the 1970s the Soviet government formally established an
institutionalized structure for coordinating and implementing active
measures (see Figure 3). This process began in 1970 when the active
measures department of the KGB was elevated to a special service called
Special Service A within the First Chief Directorate. Special Service A
was responsible for carrying out active measures which were coordinated
by the International Department (ID) of the Soviet Communist Party
(CPSU). The ID assisted the Politburo in coordinating policy by liaising
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, military, Academy of Sciences, the
KGB, and non-ruling foreign communist parties.31 In 1978, the CPSU
established another department for coordinating active measures: The
International Information Department (IID).32 The IID was responsible
for improving the effectiveness of Soviet propaganda abroad and
improving treatment of foreign affairs by domestic media. Service A of
the KGB managed the implementation of active measures coordinated by the
IID as it did for the ID.

When exploring the causal mechanisms behind the institutionalization of
active measures, one cannot overstate the influence the anti-war
movement in the United States during the Vietnam War had on Soviet
strategic thinkers. The movement demonstrated the potential efficacy of
exploiting peace movements and public opinion in democratic societies to
achieve political and security objectives.33 The foundation for this
strategy was embedded in Bolshevik and then Soviet strategic thought
which embraced the Marxist-Leninist notion that the struggle for peace
is constant and characterized by conflict.34

This same notion of constant conflict is reflected in Gerasimov's chart,
particularly with respect to the role of IPb, since it is the only means
of conflict resolution which is applied across all phases of conflict.
The role of IPb in the Gerasimov Doctrine should therefore be
interpreted as an evolution enabled by technological innovation,
globalization, and the changing nature of conflict rather than a
revolution in Russian strategic thinking about conflict.

Contemporary Russian strategic thinking about IPb developed within the
body of thought known as New Generation War \[voyna novogo pokoleniya\],
or NGW. Sergei Chekinov and Sergei Bogdanov published the seminal
article on this concept in 2013. Entitled "The Nature and Content of a
New Generation War," the piece describes thinking within the Russian
Ministry of Defense about the nature and content of warfare in the 21st
century as well as how to prepare for and emerge victorious from it. 35
NGW emphasizes the growing importance of non-military, asymmetric, and
indirect means of conflict resolution over traditional military
methods.36 The theory of victory reflects an effort to achieve reflexive
control \[refleksivnoe upravlenie\] without resorting to the military
subjugation of the adversary.37 Under NGW, traditional kinetic military
measures are used only after non-military measures and non-kinetic
military measures fail to achieve strategic objectives or de-escalate a
conflict. Figure 4 provides a graphical illustration of NGW and the
Gerasimov Doctrine.

Dima Adamsky provides a useful description of Russian NGW strategy using
Western nomenclature while avoiding the cognitively and conceptually
problematic terms such as hybrid warfare. Borrowing from the body of
thought on cross-domain deterrence, he develops a concept called Russian
cross-domain coercion. Cross-domain coercion "refers to the host of
Russian efforts to deter and to compel adversaries by orchestrating soft
and hard instruments of power across various domains, regionally and
globally." 38

NGW first arose as a way to think about Russian military policy in light
of U.S. advances in high-precision, non-nuclear military technology and
its impact on the nature of conflict in the 21st century. 39 U.S.
operations in the First Gulf War and NATO operations in the Balkans
during the Yugoslav wars were perceived by Russian strategic thinkers as
a watershed in the evolution of conflict. The advanced military
technology utilized by the U.S. and its allies allowed them to carry out
military operations remotely and with high precision, thereby decreasing
the need for the type and level of mobilization characteristic of
previous conflicts of the 20th century while simultaneously increasing
U.S. and NATO power projection. Russia, which was suffering through an
economic crisis after the collapse of the Soviet Union, was not in a
financial position to develop symmetric countermeasures to U.S.
advancements in non-nuclear military capabilities. In light of this
economic disadvantage, Russian strategic thinkers sought to
conceptualize a theory and develop a strategy for countering U.S.
conventional superiority using asymmetric, including non-military, and
less costly methods.40 Chekinov and Bogdanov note that the importance of
this intellectual effort was highlighted by President Putin during a
speech to the Federal Assembly in 2006 when he remarked: "We must
consider the plans and development trajectories of the armed forces in
other countries. We must be aware of perspective innovations. However,
we must not chase after quantitative indicators...Our response must be
based upon intellectual superiority. It will be asymmetric and less
costly."41

Justification for the informational component of NGW was provided by the
collapse of the Soviet Union, the Color Revolutions, particularly those
in the post-Soviet space, and Arab Spring.42 Chekinov and Bogdanov argue
that U.S. information warfare techniques were a major factor
contributing to the collapse of the Soviet Union.43 The perceived
effectiveness of these techniques increased with the development of the
Internet and social media. Russian strategic thinkers expressed alarm at
the role of the Internet as a vehicle for undermining regime stability
in the countries affected by the Color Revolutions and Arab Spring. They
were further alarmed by Western financial, informational, and special
operations support for anti-regime NGOs and political parties/movements
in those countries. Such support, they contend, is a form of hybrid
warfare that constitutes a violation of national sovereignty and is thus
illustrative of Western aggression.

Conclusion

This thesis aimed to identify similar processes occurring throughout the
EU by analyzing how four individual member states have approached the
issue of disinformation. In looking at incidents of disinformation in
the UK, Germany, Lithuania, and Spain, research was conducted to analyze
the incidents themselves and how governments responded, placing that
response into the wider context of securitization within those
countries. It is clear that [there is an **ongoing process of
securitization** taking place in Europe around the issue of
**disinformation**]{.underline}. [Not all countries]{.underline}
researched [have demonstrated that disinformation has been **fully
securitized**]{.underline}, but every country had elements of
securitization taking place, such as securitizing actors and speech acts
meant to draw attention to propaganda as an existential security threat.
While these countries did show the initial factors in securitization
occurring, they chose to deal with disinformation through the route of
normal politics rather than extraordinary politics. It can be concluded
that [the]{.underline} [**[level of securitization]{.underline}** [of
Russian disinformation]{.underline}]{.mark} **[within a
society]{.underline}**, [that is the treatment of propaganda and false
narratives as a security threat and how deep a country is within the
process of securitization, [played]{.mark} a **direct [role]{.mark}**
[in **shaping**]{.mark} **the [policies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [those
countries pursued in order to **counter disinformation**]{.underline}.

Examining the different cases, the research showed how history,
experience, and threat perceptions related to Russia influenced
securitization of disinformation. The United Kingdom securitized Russian
disinformation in the aftermath of a catalyst event, the attempted
assassination of former GRU agent Sergei Skripal and the subsequent
disinformation campaign in its aftermath. The UK government propelled
disinformation to extraordinary politics in its diplomatic expulsion of
Russian diplomats coordinated with its allies. Lithuania securitized
Russian disinformation over a long period of time because of its complex
history with Russia and the Soviet Union, and its experience of a slow
barrage of disinformation since it regained independence. Due to decades
of experience, Lithuania pursues a more comprehensive strategy at
countering disinformation, which seeks to address the threat at multiple
levels of society and multiple stages as false-narratives spread.

It was clear that other countries, and the EU as an organization, had
not fully securitized Russian disinformation, although they showed signs
they were in the process of securitization. Germany, in response to a
young girl's explosive accusations of rape in the context of the migrant
crisis, showed a clear preference for dealing with disinformation
through the normal political channels of Berlin's police department.
Spain took minimal responses through its foreign and defense ministries
and is still in the early stages of instituting policies aimed at
alerting the government to disinformation narratives. As a bloc, the EU
also failed to enact extraordinary policies to counteract disinformation
from Europe's Eastern neighbor, with a lack of coordination between the
individual member states and the supranational EU bodies.

[While some countries have securitized disinformation, other have chosen
a different route, and]{.underline} we can see how the **[different
policies]{.underline}** [enacted by these countries can either **protect
society**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[make society more
vulnerable]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[disinformation]{.underline}**. [Those [countries that]{.mark} have
**[securitized disinformation]{.mark}** have]{.underline} also
[[had]{.mark} the **most [success]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[countering]{.mark} [it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Continuous [policies
that]{.mark}]{.underline} not only track disinformation narratives and
discredit them as they emerge on a case-by-case basis, but also
[**[build resilience]{.mark}** at the source through]{.underline}
[policy efforts]{.underline} in the social, cultural, educational, and
political realm [[have **proven more effective**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Media literacy, Russian language programming, and public statements
exposing false stories can all have an impact. [[Disinformation
narratives]{.mark} have often [failed to cause]{.mark} the
same]{.underline} **[[explosive consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in
those countries that have instituted]{.underline} **[comprehensive
strategies]{.underline}** [to counter it.]{.underline}
**[[Internationalization]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of
counterdisinformation policies]{.underline}, **[[seeking
solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} [joint]{.underline}
[initiatives [with]{.mark} **like-minded [allies]{.mark},**]{.underline}
[has also [proven]{.mark} more [effective]{.mark}]{.underline}
[cultivating societies that are **less vulnerable** to **fake
news**]{.underline}. Diplomatic expulsions, online tracking, and
coordinated alert systems have the potential to ensure that the more
vulnerable countries in the EU do not let disinformation exert influence
on political processes and thereby endanger the bloc as a whole.

[This [paper]{.mark} has also [argued against '**negative'**]{.mark}
**conceptions** of [securitization]{.mark} in relation to the issue of
disinformation]{.underline}. It has warned that [[disinformation
**is**]{.mark} **indeed [a security threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
liberal democracies in the West, [[with]{.mark} its [ability to
**destroy**]{.mark} **foundations of [shared
truth]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially
~~cripple~~ \[**[destroy]{.underline}**\] [[democratic]{.mark}
decision-making [processes]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [While **critical
IR**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**theorists** believe]{.mark}
[securitization should be **avoided**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [protect openness and accountability, and frame the
process in a **negative light**]{.underline}, this paper has argued that
[[securitization is]{.mark} a **[necessary]{.mark} protective
measure**]{.underline} [[and **does not inherently lead to abuse of
state power**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Policies]{.mark} [pursued]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} the case study [countries that]{.mark} have

**extraordinary**]{.underline}, [[countermeasures]{.mark} against
disinformation **[do not]{.mark} necessarily need to [violate]{.mark}
the [democratic values]{.mark} they are meant to protect.**]{.underline}
[These policies do not need to be **exclusive** towards Russian
minorities, but [can be **inclusive**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[contribute to public life]{.underline}**. If
European countries and the EU as an institution value the democratic
principles that govern their societies, [a conscious, successful

### AT: Psychoanalysis

#### Can't scale up psychoanalysis -- sweeps historic and cultural forces unique to [state political units]{.underline} [under the rug]{.underline} 

R.D. **Hinshelwood 16**, Professor of Psychoanalytic Studies at the
University of Essex, 5/11/2016, Reflection or action And never the twain
shall meet,
https://freudconference.wordpress.com/2016/05/11/reflection-or-action-and-never-the-twain-shall-meet/

[There is a **major problem in using psychoanalysis in political
activity**]{.underline}. [The [unconscious individual
influences]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} the [external social ones
are essentially different]{.mark} categories, and can be
bridged]{.underline} conceptually [only with]{.underline} some
[difficulty. I have been struck for some time by the **conceptual
divergence**]{.underline}. In 1996, making an attempt to understand the
convergence between a social (contemporary Marxist) explanation and an
internalist, psychoanalytic explanation of human personality and
experience, I noted that both paradigms are avowedly materialist; so,¶
[Economic activity and bodily experiences create separate theories
\[but\] they also generate **separate superstructures**]{.underline} --
the world of social relations and the world of object relations
respectively... \[T\]he two superstructures converge. They lean together
and coincide At certain points, we have dealt with three of those points
-- oppression/repression, alienation/depersonalisation and
commodity/identity (Hinshelwood 1996, p. 100-101).¶ In this Chapter, I
return to this paradigm, and take further the
alienation/depersonalisation point of convergence. The dialectical
relations can be unpacked as several interactive cycles,¶ Group dynamics
and the Labour Party¶ Back in the 1990s, I was part of a group that
worked out some ideas which we might take to the Labour Party. You may
remember that the dying regime of the Conservatives, Mrs Thatcher and
John Major was hanging on, and with the election in 1997 coming up, the
Labour Party was desperate to convince the electorate of its better
policies. The idea was whether we could give an account of group
dynamics which might be helpful to Labour to understand the way to
create a more democratic society. At the time Labour were talking about
'the third way'; somewhat vague, but it appeared that it might promote
more measured attitudes in Society suggestive of depressive position
thinking -- ambivalence, considerateness towards everyone, and generally
a reluctance towards the unrealistic perfectionism of ideologies. It
seemed there could be a match between the political rhetoric and the
study of unconscious group processes. In the event when we met a couple
of people at Millbank, it was clear they were politely indifferent to
what we were trying to present. Their interest was whether we had the
secret of how to influence the electorate to vote for Labour. They
wanted advice on their marketing. There seemed a radical disconnection
between our earnest views about a more mature society, and their wish
for effective marketing.¶ I have thought, over the years, about our
naïvety. Obviously there is a potential for psychology to be used as a
social and public instrument for manipulation, and later, I came across
the writing of one of the founders of marketing and public relations, in
the US back in the 1920s. He wrote,¶ If we understand the mechanism and
motives of the group mind, is it not possible to control and regiment
the masses according to our will without their knowing about it?
(Bernays 1928, p, 71).¶ and¶ The conscious and intelligent manipulation
of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important
element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen
mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the
true ruling power of our country (Bernays 1928, p.37).¶ I find this
unpalatable. Shamefully, this author, a founder of this 'invisible
government' as he called it, was Edward Bernays, Freud's nephew. He,
like Freud, was interested in the 'unseen mechanisms' at work in
individuals -- but for different purposes. ¶ Political change and
psychoanalytic change¶ [The aim of psychoanalysis is to change
things.]{.underline} That is what patients want help with. [The aim of
politics is also to change things. But the changes, and how they are
brought about, are completely different. Is that difference
bridgeable?]{.underline} [Influencing a patient towards some healthy
state, and doing the same for society, shouldn't be impossibly
different. After all a society is made of people. So what really is the
difference,]{.underline} and how can one inform the other?¶ [[Practising
psychoanalysts address the internal unconscious]{.mark} factors that
determine an individual's personality --]{.underline} and how the
individual is captured and controlled by them. [On the other hand,
[political attitudes and actions are socially generated]{.mark},
arising,]{.underline} many would say, [from the economic system of
production. [The individual is located at the junction of these two sets
of influences]{.mark}, one from inside and one from
outside.]{.underline} If someone has [a phobia for spiders]{.underline},
he [is driven by internal factors]{.underline} (his unconscious
imagining, say, that the web-like embrace is a controlling mother). [If
someone drives his car on the left-hand side of the road, it is from
social forces -- the highway-code, police patrol cars,
etc]{.underline}.¶ [These are inherently different kinds of
influences.]{.underline} How do social and unconscious determinisms fit
together? [Edward Bernays decided it is simple, the external social
category is used to manipulate the individuals' interior unconscious
choices]{.underline}. Well.... for me [that is not good
enough]{.underline}, and I am interested in whether there are other ways
by which these two categories of influences can be combined in our
understanding). ¶ Interpreting society!¶ I claim we need to find models
of interaction between social relations and psychodynamics. [[It
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, otherwise, [so [easy for]{.mark}]{.underline}
us, [[psychoanalysts]{.underline}]{.mark}, [to approach society or
social institutions as if they were individuals. [To equate a]{.mark}
social [organisation with the individual]{.mark} mind [risks leaving out
the very valid social, historical, political forces that]{.mark} act on
organisations, create cultures and [induce or enable individuals to
collaborate]{.mark} unconsciously]{.underline}, [as well as consciously,
with each other]{.underline}.. ¶ I am thinking of the campaign started
by psychoanalysts [in the 1980s]{.underline}, [Psychoanalytic
Psychotherapists against Nuclear War]{.underline}
([[PPANW]{.underline}]{.mark}). Led by Hanna Segal's especial interest,
expressed in her paper 'Silence is the real crime' (Segal 1987), [the
individual defence mechanisms she suggested seemed to be simply
aggregated, and she [talked of regression during wartime]{.mark} from
depressive position to paranoid-schizoid functioning. The campaign
remained largely ineffective, so, it seemed [there were serious
limitations]{.mark}]{.underline} [to]{.underline} this kind of
individualistic political approach --[interpreting a supposed
unconscious as if it were an individual unconscious. **[The political
problem only disappeared with a political
solution]{.mark}**]{.underline} [-- the collapse of the cold war in
1990. I would suggest that **attributing individual dynamics to social
and political issues risks psychoanalysis becoming irrelevant to social
scientists and politicians.**]{.underline}

Second, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[structural-[epistemological
problem]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[is]{.mark} that]{.underline}, if
psychoanalytic practice is not to be theoretically heavy-handed, then
[[psychoanalysts can]{.underline} **[only know what
individuals]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[within analysis [can
know]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and if]{.underline} [social relations are
reified]{.underline}, then [[there is a]{.underline} **[socially imposed
limit]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [insights]{.mark}
achieved [and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[future
prospects]{.underline}**]{.mark} [delivered [via
analysis]{.mark}.]{.underline} If social objectivity is dissimulated and
mystified, that is, [if the structures of our interdependence are
socially opaque]{.underline} and the forces organizing modern social
life are self-obscuring, [then this reification is bound to be
reproduced in the source material of analysis, that is, in the
analysand's self-experience]{.underline}. So, [when [the analyst]{.mark}
facilitates the analysand's freedom to experience]{.underline}, think,
feel, and ultimately commit [herself otherwise]{.underline}, **[[all he
really can do is help the analysand]{.underline}]{.mark}**, say,
[[commit]{.mark} herself [to forms of]{.mark} self- and world [relation
that appear]{.mark}]{.underline} less injurious or [[more
livable]{.underline} ***[to her]{.underline}***]{.mark}, [[but what
appears]{.underline}]{.mark} less injurious or [more viable
will]{.underline} in all likelihood [be limited to that
which]{.underline} ***[can appear so]{.underline}*** [from the
historically sedimented purview of a]{.underline} more or less
[bourgeois, self-interested, rights-bearing being]{.underline}. That is,
[what becomes available via [analysis is that which can become available
to the]{.mark} sociohistorically positioned
[analysand]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[not only is there]{.underline}
**[nothing psychoanalysis can do to get around this]{.underline}**,
[psychoanalysis is]{.underline} **[not even in a position to shed light
on the problem]{.underline}**]{.mark} without delving into social theory
and thereby abdicating its mandate to tarry with the problems and issues
that the analysand experiences as at the heart of her predicaments.
[[Analytic practice is]{.underline}]{.mark} caught **[[in a double
bind]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [[as it seeks the emancipation of the
analysand]{.underline}, [either it is]{.underline}]{.mark} forced to
become **[[politically didactic and]{.mark} consequently
[counterproductive]{.mark}]{.underline}** (or at least problematic qua
analysis), [[or it]{.underline} **[promotes]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[the [extremely limited forms of emancipation]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[imaginable by a]{.mark} typical [bourgeois
subject]{.mark}]{.underline}---and so it should be no surprise that,
from Freud onward, emancipation tends to be figured in terms of greater
capacities for love and work. \[Italics in original\]

[Humanity's **capacity for self‐destruction**]{.underline} [poses a

[survival interdependence]{.underline} . [Survival interdependence means
that the survival of human societies on one side of the
world]{.underline} **[increasingly depends]{.underline}** [on the
(in)action of human societies on the other]{.underline}. For most of
history, human societies -- clans, tribes, city‐states, empires, and
nation states -- could seek security irrespective of the security of
other societies; but today **[no single nation state]{.underline}** [can
solve the biggest security problems of the times on their

security' -- but material (Deudney, 2007, 2018), especially certain
human‐driven trends in technology and the environment that could
threaten humanity with destruction. Security policy must take into
account the significance of these changes. Thus, [a **new security
framework** is required]{.underline}.

**[['Existential security']{.underline}]{.mark}** [responds to a similar
set of questions as]{.underline} **[alternative security
frames]{.underline}** (see Table 2). **[Security for
whom?]{.underline}** [The **['referent object']{.mark}** of existential
security [is **humanity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Security]{.mark}
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [[about]{.mark} **[humanity's
survival]{.mark}**]{.underline} . **[Security for which
values?]{.underline}** [The 'values' to be secured are]{.underline}, at
the minimum, [the survival of humanity]{.underline} (i.e. [the
**biological entity** of the human species and **cultural entity** of
human civilization]{.underline}), and, at the maximum, the long‐term
prosperity of human civilization and the planet. [The security of
humankind ranges from the survival of existing human beings and
societies to past and future generations of humanity -- the **past whose
memory is recorded in history and preserved by the present**, and the
future whose possibilities of existence depend on actions taken in the
present]{.underline}. **[Existential security]{.underline}** therefore
[[adopts an **intergenerational perspective**]{.mark} of
security]{.underline}, **[[not only for utilitarian
reasons]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([e.g. quantifying the potential
gains/losses in 'future lives']{.underline}) (Baum, 2015; Bostrom, 2002,
2013; Torres, 2017), [but [also because **the significance of
humankind**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- that is, [all its **past
sufferings**, **present achievements**, and **future
potential**]{.underline} -- [[is at stake]{.underline}]{.mark}, [since
existential risks simultaneously threaten humanity's past, present, and
future]{.underline} (Morgenthau, 1961).

**[How much security?]{.underline}** [Nick Bostrom]{.underline} (2013,
p. 19) [proposes the principle of 'maxipok']{.underline}, [in which
security policy would seek to 'maximise the probability of an "OK
outcome"]{.underline}, [where an OK outcome is any outcome that avoids
existential catastrophe']{.underline}. [While reducing the probability
of existential risk to 'zero' may]{.underline} [be
impossible]{.underline}, [the amount of security should be determined by
a level of risk‐aversion equivalent to existential threats]{.underline}.
[Since thinking in terms of 'worst‐case scenarios' is a common practice
in the security domain]{.underline}, [and since some **['worst‐case
scenarios']{.mark}** could include civilizational collapse or human
extinction]{.underline}, [this]{.underline} [should imply a **strong
aversion to risk**]{.underline}. [Although there are logical limits to
the 'precautionary principle' with respect to existential
risks]{.underline},10 [it [has **practical**]{.mark}
**[implications]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for]{.underline}]{.mark}
security [[policy]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[such as
taking]{.underline}]{.mark} preventive, cost‐effective, and
**[[long‐term oriented action]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Clarke, 2005).
More generally, [[making]{.mark} (existential) [security a]{.mark}
[priority **does not**]{.mark} **imply the [sacrifice]{.mark} of all
[other values]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. political liberty, economic
wealth), **[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** it [[does
mean]{.underline}]{.mark} that [potential **[gains]{.mark} in other
values** [be weighed against]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[potential
losses]{.mark} in security]{.underline}**. [Security is always a
question of degree]{.underline} (Wolfers, 1952).

**[From what threats?]{.underline}** [Existential security is [concerned
with]{.mark} those [threats that have]{.mark} their [**origins in human
agency** and could bring about]{.mark} civilizational collapse or human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. This requires broadening the security
agenda beyond its conventional focus on 'security from violence', while
excluding 'natural' existential risks (e.g. asteroids and
supervolcanos). [There are two main reasons for emphasizing
anthropogenic threats]{.underline}. [The first is the low probability of
natural risks on **timescales relevant to humanity**]{.underline}
(Bostrom, 2013; Bostrom and Cirkovic, 2008;), [whereas anthropogenic
threats are, by definition, relevant to human timescales]{.underline},
[including the twenty‐first century]{.underline} (Rees, 2003). The
second is that many prevention/mitigation strategies for anthropogenic
existential threats act on their drivers in human agency, which makes
little sense for natural risks. [The spectrum of anthropogenic
existential threats includes threats to international peace and
security]{.underline} (**[[e.g. nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}**),
[dangers from human intervention in the natural environment]{.underline}
(**[e.g. [climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}**), [[and]{.mark} risks
from emerging technologies]{.underline} (**[e.g.
[AI]{.mark}]{.underline}**). [Existential security must take into
account the complex relationships between human, environmental, and
technological systems, as well as inherent uncertainties about
existential threat scenarios]{.underline} (e.g. 'nuclear winter',
'hothouse Earth', or 'superintelligence').

**[By what means and modes of protection?]{.underline}** [The
existential security frame requires innovation in the means and modes of
security policy]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline}
[because]{.underline} the **[conventional emphasis]{.underline}** [on
military capabilities and balancing is either inadequate]{.underline}
(e.g. nuclear war), [irrelevant]{.underline} (e.g. climate change), [or
counterproductive]{.underline} (e.g. AI). Moreover, the [pursuit of
**relative gains/losses** in security is fundamentally
misguided]{.underline} for anthropogenic existential threats, since --
as a general principle -- [either all human societies are safe, or none
of them are]{.underline}. Existential security requires a paradigm shift
from thinking about security policy as a matter of (national) 'defense'
to being a matter of (global) 'governance'. [Governance is **not an end
in itself**]{.underline} (e.g. the creation of a 'world state'),
**[but]{.underline}** [rather **a means to security**]{.underline} (i.e.
**[the survival of humankind]{.underline}**). [The pursuit of
existential security requires means of protection that involve a
comprehensive set of political, economic, and technological resources --
not merely military capabilities]{.underline}. The **[modes of
protection]{.underline}** [are primarily **'restraint'** and
**'resilience'**]{.underline}. Restraint is a prevention strategy, while
resilience is a mitigation strategy, which take on different forms for
different threats. [For the]{.underline} [nuclear threat]{.underline},
[restraint manifests itself in the policies of **disarmament**, **arms
control**, and nonproliferation]{.underline}, while resilience comes
mostly in the form of nuclear bunkers and shelters (Bull, 1961; Deudney,
2007). [For climate change]{.underline}, [restraint is]{.underline}
primarily [about limiting greenhouse gas emissions and the degradation
of carbon sinks, while resilience is about making societies less
vulnerable to heat stress, rising seas, food and water scarcities, new
diseases, and human migration]{.underline} (Wallace‐Wells, 2019; World
Bank, 2012). For AI, restraint entails the slow and careful development
of AI (Bostrom, 2014) -- or perhaps forgoing the 'AI dream' altogether
(Joy, 2000) -- while resilience is about reducing societal vulnerability
to technological disruption (e.g. cybersecurity). Importantly, the
growing survival interdependence of human societies implies that
restraint and resilience must be mutual to be effective. If only some
states choose disarmament or nonproliferation, if some societies reduce
carbon emissions while others increase them, or if one technology firm
decides to rapidly pursue 'superintelligence', then the (in)action of
some actors may affect the security of all humankind. This emphasis on
mutual restraint and resilience [**contrasts** with the **national
security frame\'s** emphasis on **'self‐help'**]{.underline}.

[With regard to ontological security, the distinction between security
and insecurity is]{.underline} the more **[critical]{.underline}** one.
[In a state of **ontological insecurity,**]{.underline} [the Self
experiences **instability**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[uncertainty of being]{.underline}**. [Ontological insecurity refers
to a]{.underline} [state of **disruption**]{.underline} [where the Self
has **lost its anchor**]{.underline} [for the definition of its
identity]{.underline} [and,]{.underline} consequently, [its ability to
sustain a narrative and answer questions about doing, acting, and being
(]{.underline}Kinnvall 2004). It may arise from deep uncertainty (Mitzen
2006a) and/or from the failure to have its sense of Self affirmed by
others (Zarakol 2010). [Conversely, in a state of ontological security,
the Self experiences a **stable**, **certain**, and **consistent**
social existence]{.underline}, [where it remains in control about its
identity and capacity for action]{.underline}. While I do not rule out
the possibility of a state of ontological asecurity, where the Self is
simply not concerned with the stability and certainty of its identity, I
do not explore this possibility and how it varies across different
states of physical security in this article.

Having identified different states of physical and ontological security,
I make the further assumption that [since **ontological** and
**physical** security]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
**[distinct]{.underline}**, [states of security do not vary
**uniformly** across the ontological and physical layers of
security.]{.underline} [One can be at a state of physical insecurity
while being at a state of ontological security, and vice
versa.]{.underline} Consequently, Table 1 charts out the four possible
states of security based on the conception of security as both
ontological and physical.

[The [state of **ontological
insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline}[/[physical
(in)security]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is]{.mark} one [where]{.mark} [the
Self experiences concern about]{.mark} **[physical
harm]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the
**[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and uncertainty [of its
**being**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Ontological insecurity **tempts
actors** to engage in practices that mark Others as not only
**different**]{.underline}, [but also as **morally
inferior**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[threatening]{.underline}**
(Campbell 1992). **[[Ontological]{.mark} insecurity [and physical
(in)security reproduce one another]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[As actors
**seek ontologica l security**]{.mark} [through **constructing Others
as**]{.mark} **[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to their
security-as-survival]{.underline}, [[they **mobilise**]{.mark} **their
[physical defences]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} the **[pursuit of
physical security]{.mark}**]{.underline} [through representing the
sources of threat as **different** and **morally
inferior.**]{.underline}

[Similarly, in a state of ontological security/physical (in)security,
actors experience stability and certainty of being in a relationship
where the Other is constructed as threat to their security-as-survival.
Consequently, they remain locked]{.underline} [into]{.underline}
**[conflict-producing routines]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[maintain their certainty of being]{.underline}** (Mitzen 2006a). In
protracted conflicts such as in Cyprus and Israel/Palestine, this state
of security sustains a stable Self/Other relationship based on enemy
roles. [When in such a state of security, minority and majority groups,
migrants and host societies perceive and represent each other's
identities as radically different and inherently incompatible, and
reproduce these perceptions and representations through acts of
securitisation]{.underline} [in order to **ensure their ontological
security**.]{.underline} The states of ontological insecurity/physical
(in)security and ontological security/physical (in)security are both
securitised states; however, whereas the former compels actors to
construct new narratives of difference and threat and engage in the
securitisation of new issues to regain their certainty and stability of
being, the latter compels actors to reproduce the existing narratives
and continue the securitisation of existing differences and conflicts to
maintain it.

[[The state of **ontological security**/**physical asecurity**
is]{.mark} certainly **the [most attractive]{.mark} state of
security**]{.underline} [from a **normative**]{.underline} [point of
view]{.underline}. [[**Security communities** in i]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations]{.underline}, and in particular, the European non-war
community (Wæver 1998) and the Nordic community (Browning and Joenniemi
2012) [[constitute the best examples]{.mark} of such a state of security
in international relations.]{.underline} [[A **collective identity
discourse**]{.underline} [makes it possible]{.underline} ]{.mark}[for
states in security communities [to maintain]{.mark} the [us/them]{.mark}
[distinctions]{.mark}, which are]{.underline}
[**[necessary]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the
**certainty** and **[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of
being]{.underline}]{.mark}, [while remaining in a state of **physical
asecurity** vis-à-vis one another]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006b; Browning
and Joenniemi 2012). [[In this state]{.mark} of security, **[conflicts
are sustainably resolved]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [issues that have
propelled conflict in the past are either **settled**]{.underline} [or
have **[shed]{.mark} their [physical
security-ness]{.mark},**]{.underline} [and are negotiated in normal
political channels]{.underline}. Yet, identity differences maintain
their ontological security-ness as groups reproduce their distinct
identities through various social and cultural practices.

[[Hybrid warfare]{.mark} [indicates]{.mark} a [**multitude** of]{.mark}
possible **[contingencies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[generating anxiety
about]{.mark} one's [ability to **remain oneself**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}and to continue to act. [It is thus [linked to "anxiety over
the **vulnerability of \[Western\] power**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Bell
2012, pp. 230--231), [threatening the West about losing its
particularistic **form of existence**]{.underline} (cf. Creppell 2011,
p. 455). Anxiety, in contrast to fear, which per Giddens (1991, p. 43)
constitutes a response to a specific threat, concerns "perceived threats
to the integrity of the security system of the individual" (Giddens
1991, pp. 44--45, cf. Browning and Joenniemi 2017, p. 38; Rumelili
2015). [[OS-seeking aims to **mitigate the effects** of such hard
uncertainty]{.mark}, **[bringing it within bearable
limits]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 346).
**[Routines]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
**[instrumental]{.underline}** [here, as they "**pacify the cognitive
environment**]{.underline} ... '**[inoculating' individuals against
paralytic, deep fear of chaos]{.underline}**" (Mitzen 2006, p. 347).

[[Being able to **survive**]{.mark} the ["hybrid threats" is]{.mark}
**directly [pertinent]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the [survival
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the EU and **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as
particular kinds of organisations, underpinned and **driven by specific
values**]{.underline} -- [which cannot be sacrificed or diluted in the
struggle for physical and institutional survival]{.underline}. [Yet,
hybrid warfare disturbs **the OS**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the EU
and [NATO]{.underline} in subtly distinct ways. Due to the
particularities of their institutional set-ups and historical
foundations, the OS drives of the two organisations are somewhat
distinctive. NATO's history is occasionally told through its surpassing
of a sequence of crises, albeit the end of the Cold War and the collapse
of its original enemy created a situation of unprecedented uncertainty
and ontological insecurity for the Alliance. Meanwhile, the EU's
ontological insecurity is a more recent phenomenon, stemming mostly from
the Eurocrisis and the looming possibility of a Grexit a few years ago;
the refugee/migration crisis in Europe of 2015 (Dingott Alkhoper 2018;
Mitzen 2018); the actual UK decision on Brexit in 2016 (Browning 2018);
and the rise of populist politics within the EU (Kinnvall, Manners,
Mitzen 2018) and the United States. [[NATO]{.mark} as a military
alliance [has been]{.mark} historically more [accustomed to]{.mark} the
othering [practices of **concrete geographical
places**]{.mark}]{.underline}, whereas the EU is generally regarded as
an organisation that has risen above geopolitical othering, juxtaposing
itself to Europe's dark past instead (Rumelili 2018, Subotic 2018, and
Della Sala 2018). Accordingly, the EU might be more at home with hybrid
threat management due to its historically broader conceptualisation of
security through the paradigm of intertwined risks rather than being
focused more strictly on "the threat, use and control of military force"
in the manner of a traditional defence alliance (Walt 1991, p. 212;
Manners 2002). Regardless of its perpetual transformer's self-image,
[[hybrid threats represent]{.mark} the uncomfortable "hard" or
"[**fundamental**" uncertainty for NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} (cf. Mitzen
2006, p. 346) [[and are]{.mark} thus [**ontologically disturbing** for
the security of **its self** as a **traditional alliance**]{.mark} [with
a **collective security pledge** bound to **"armed
attack"**]{.mark}]{.underline} [against one or more of its member
states]{.underline}.

[[In order to achieve OS, actors strive for **"routinizing**
]{.mark}**their [relations with]{.mark} significant
[others"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 342).
**[[Routines]{.underline}]{.mark}** [help to **[keep ontological fears
at bay]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [out of **everyday discursive
consciousness**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 348). From this
perspective, NATO's naming and shaming strategy vis-à-vis Russia as part
of its hybrid warfare countering strategy links the uncertainty
emanating from the hybrid nature of the new threats to the known and
routine relationship with its traditional antagonist.8 The
incapacitating [[difficulties related to **planning ahead**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [**anticipating** and]{.underline}
[**[countering]{.underline}** [hybrid engagements
are]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [somewhat
**[alleviated]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} latter's [attachment to a **known
rival**]{.underline}. [Russia's hybrid intervention in Ukraine has
concurrently provided NATO with the familiar parameters of the cognitive
"cocoon]{.underline}" (Giddens 1991, pp. 39--40) [which enables the
alliance to **reproduce its cognitively "knowable" world**]{.underline}.
A Mitzenian reading of NATO's emerging response to hybrid
threats/warfare thus points at the renewed routinisation of the
"programmed cognitive and behavioral responses" to Russia as the
alliance's original nemesis.

Restoring traditional vigilance vis-à-vis Russia, buttressing the
forward defence along the Alliance's eastern flank with the respective
military reinforcements, **[[contingency planning]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and exercises, [the emerging response of NATO to the hybrid menace could
also be read [as a]{.mark}n []{.mark}**attempted [restoration of a known
normative order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for the North Atlantic
Alliance]{.underline}. [Hybrid warfare endangers the basic features of
the said normative order]{.underline} (or that of the broadly conceived
Western security community in general, including the EU as well) as its
efficient countering would likely compromise the underlying principles
for this order's particularistic existence (cf. Creppell 2011, p. 450).
As a threat of subversion, [hybrid warfare exposes the internal
vulnerabilities in the body of the traditional security alliance
(NATO)]{.underline} and a self-proclaimed post-modern security actor
(i.e. the EU; cf. Cooper 2004). This concerns, in particular, the
ever-elusive (and contested) balance between national/organisational
security and individual liberties (cf. Waldron 2003, Neocleous 2007), as
strategic communication is inherently at odds with free speech as a core
value of Western liberalism. Countering hybrid warfare is conducive of
generating a security predicament of perpetual pre-emption which, by
definition, would indicate pre-emptive gathering of all sorts of data,
thus likely infringing on the privacy of the individuals for the sake of
the organisational/regional/national security. This precautionary logic
resonates with the risk society approach which characterises the
struggling with a sheer volume of risks with potentially fundamental
consequences as a key feature of modernity, implying that "decisions are
... made not in context of certainty, nor even of available knowledge,
but of doubt, premonition, foreboding, challenge, mistrust, fear, and
anxiety" (Ewald 2002, p. 294).

Critical Situations and Ontological Insecurity

The [issue of critical situations which produce ontological insecurity
of collective actors has been a neglected topic in the literature on OST
in IR.]{.underline} So far, only a few authors have reflected on the
role of critical situations in ontological security processes in world
politics. Drawing on Giddens, Brent Steele for example argues that
[[critical situations are]{.mark} unpredictable [events
that]{.mark}]{.underline} affect a large number of individuals,
[**[catch state]{.mark} [agents off-guard]{.mark}** [and
**disrupt**]{.mark} **their [self-identities]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Steele 2008: 12). [It is **irrelevant**]{.underline}, in his view,
[whether or not a]{.underline} **[researcher]{.underline}**
**[decides]{.underline}** [if an event constitutes a critical
situation]{.underline}; [[what matters is whether]{.mark}
**[policymakers]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[interpret them as
such]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Critical situations are
therefore]{.underline} not objective facts but [social constructions
produced in the very process of interpretation]{.underline} (ibid.).
Dimitry Chernobrov has a similar understanding of international crises
as unpredictable set of events that create great uncertainty and which
states often (mis)recognise because they rely on narcissistic
self-conceptions (Chernobrov 2016).

While I fully concur that critical situations are radical and socially
constructed disruptions that put self-identities to the test, they seem
to be more than that. In fact, such conceptualisation of a critical
situation is so wide and elastic that most crises in world politics, if
not all, can easily fit into this definition. For example, it could be
argued that every terrorist attack is usually unpredictable, affects a
large number of individuals, catches a state off-guard and disrupts
self-identity narratives. And yet, if any crisis can be treated by
analysts as a critical situation, the concept of ontological
(in)security loses analytical sharpness and an important part of its
value to IR theory. As a result of this conceptual underdevelopment, we
currently have few conceptual tools in IR to identify and analyse
critical situations and the conceptual distinction between ontological
security and ontological insecurity remains elusive.

This book fills this gap by proposing a conceptual framework to study
ontological insecurity and critical situations. By drawing on the work
of Anthony Giddens, I [[define]{.mark} [**ontological security**
in]{.mark}]{.underline} [[world politics as
**possession**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [on the level of the unconscious
and practical consciousness]{.underline}, [[of answers to]{.mark} four
[fundamental questions]{.mark}]{.underline} [that all polities in some
way need to address.]{.underline} These questions are [[related to
existence]{.mark}; finitude; relations and auto-biography]{.underline}.
[Collective [actors become ontologically]{.mark} [insecure when critical
situations rupture their routines]{.mark}, thus [bringing]{.mark}
**[fundamental questions]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the **level of discursive
[consciousness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Their inability to **'bracket
out' fundamental questions** [produces **anxiety** and a **loss of
agency.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

What does it mean to be ontologically secure? According to Giddens, 'To
be ontologically secure is to possess, on the level of the unconscious
and practical consciousness, answers to fundamental existential
questions which all human life in some way addresses'. These fundamental
existential questions relate to existence and being, finitude and human
life, the experience of others and the continuity of self-identity
(Giddens 1991: 47). As he noted, 'To live our lives we normally take for
granted issues which, as centuries of philosophical enquiry have found,
wither away under the sceptical gaze' (Giddens 1991: 37). In other
words, in order to be ontologically secure, agents have to be able to
'bracket out' these fundamental questions through routines of daily
life, thus building trust into the constancy of their social and
material environment and fending off existential anxieties. If unable to
put aside these existential trepidations related to death, transience of
life and the continuity of the self and others, individuals simply
cannot 'go on' with their daily life. [Ontological insecurity, on the
other hand, is a result of critical situations, circumstances of radical
and unpredictable [disjuncture]{.mark} 'that **[threaten]{.mark}** or
**destroy** the certitudes of **[institutionalised
routines']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Giddens 1984: 62). Critical situations
remove the protective cocoon created by routines and move fundamental
questions, previously taken for granted, into the realm of discursive
consciousness. The result is the 'flooding through' of shame and guilt
from the unconscious mind (ibid.: 57). [The sudden inability of agents
to 'go on' by relying on the unspoken know-how unleashes an upsurge of
anxiety expressed in regressive modes of behaviour followed by attempts
to **re-establish routines** and **regain cognitive
control**]{.underline} [over the changed environment]{.underline}
(ibid.: 64). In these 'faithful moments' as Bahar Rumelili calls them,
'anxieties can no longer be controlled' and 'ontological security comes
under immediate strain' (Rumelili 2015b: 11).

The distinction between discursive consciousness, practical
consciousness and unconsciousness is of paramount importance here
(Giddens 1984: 41--45). Discursive consciousness is the ability of
actors to verbally express their actions. Practical consciousness,
crucial for the maintenance of ontological security, is tacit knowledge
about how to 'go on' without a need to express it discursively. Between
practical and discursive consciousness there is a free flow of
information. When asked to give discursive expression of something that
is based on background knowledge, such as driving a car or practising
table manners for example, agents are more or less able to do it but
they do not need much knowledge to carry out a competent performance.
Finally, unconsciousness includes cognitions that are 'either wholly
repressed from consciousness or appear in consciousness only in
distorted form' (ibid.: 5). Unlike practical and discursive
consciousness, the unconscious mind is therefore separated from the
previous two with a bar of repression.

The starting point of this book is that [critical situations can also
affect **collective agents.**]{.underline} However, in contrast to
individual experience of anxiety that does not have to be expressed
discursively, I posit that when collective actors are concerned, anxiety
outbursts are performed through a public discourse on fundamental
questions. Several studies on ontological security in IR have made a
passing reference to this feature of ontological security as the ability
to 'bracket out' fundamental questions in order to 'go on' with daily
unfolding of international life (Kinnvall 2004: 759; Krolikowski 2008:
111; Steele 2008: 51). However, none of these studies have delved deeper
into what these questions were, their relationship with critical
situations and how all this could be translated into the field of world
politics. In the rest of this section, I intend to bridge this gap. The
first fundamental question is related to 'existence and being' that,
according to Giddens, is about an 'ontological framework of external
reality' (Giddens 1991: 48). This awareness 'of being against non-being'
lies at the core of human freedom that generates anxiety. Giddens writes
that answers to this fundamental question (like all others) are lodged
at the level of practical consciousness. In pre-modern contexts, it was
tradition that provided answers to this existential question and creates
a sense of firmness of the world. In the context of high modernity,
individuals can try to rely on tradition but this will not provide them
with safe ground. Consequently, they have to continuously reflexively
reorder their activities in light of new information.2

This book posits that [[collective actors]{.mark} in world

**continuity** of their **external environment**]{.underline}. [The

**[traditions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[institutions]{.underline}**, [offers one such ontological framework
for states]{.underline} (Bull 1977). [[To be **ontologically

insecurity has been well documented in psychology and social

For polities, feeling at home in international society [provides a

[Bracketing out the fundamental questions is accomplished through
routinisation]{.underline} [of]{.underline} what the English School
calls the primary institutions of international society. Here I have in
mind '[deep and relatively durable social practices']{.underline} [[such

**durability** of]{.underline} [the secondary institutions of
international society, such as **[security
regimes]{.mark}**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[international
organisations]{.underline}**, [[can]{.mark} also **[inoculate states

**international security institutions'**]{.underline}, argue
Berenskoetter and Giegerich, '[because they enable states to gain (and
sustain) **ontological security**]{.underline} [[by negotiating a
**shared sense of international order**]{.mark} with
friends']{.underline} (Berenskoetter and Giegerich 2010: 410). Taking
part in these durable practices of international society [provides

claimed, intersubjective pressures and stigmata exerted in the past by
the 'civilised' society of states become with time an integral part of

Tragedy is largely absent from the existing normative debate on
securitization. Instead, the [[debate has]{.underline}]{.mark} become
[[organized around whether securitization]{.mark} [is]{.mark} a
[**"negative"** or **"positive"**]{.mark} concept]{.underline}. In the
classic formulation, the Copenhagen School points to how "\[n\]ational
security should not be idealized. It works to silence opposition and has
given power-holders many opportunities to exploit 'threats' for domestic
purposes" (Buzan et al. 1998, 29; Williams 2003). [Securitization has
negative effects when it functions as "a political technology that
consistently favors the interests of the powerful and enables violence
and exclusion"]{.underline} (McDonald 2015, 154). Correspondingly, Wæver
admits a "'bias' for desecuritization" or de-escalation, although he
quickly notes that this is "not always better than securitization"
(Wæver 2011, 469). **[At the same time]{.underline}**, a number of
approaches point to cases where **[securitization]{.underline}** [is
ethically desirable]{.underline}. In her compelling consequentialist
argument, for example, Floyd asks "whether the consequences of, and the
gains from, the securitization are preferable relative to the
consequences and gains from a politicization" (2007, 338). Relatedly,
Roe contends that "[[the extent to which securitization
necessitates]{.mark} a **[lack of]{.mark} openness and
[deliberation]{.mark}** [has been **overexaggerated**]{.mark}" and
suggests it may even elicit unappreciated forms of
cooperation]{.underline} (2012, 250).

[[The]{.mark} problem with the **negative/positive [debate]{.mark}** is
that it appears to [impose **moral certitude** where there]{.mark} often
[is none]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Registering securitizing moves as
clearly positive or negative can be difficult because their effects can
be mixed and temporally distant]{.underline}. The difficulty in making
this determination may also be an indicator of the uncertainty
surrounding securitizing moves. [In the end, [because]{.mark} the
[outcomes of security claims are]{.mark} **[uncertain]{.mark}**, [we
cannot know]{.mark} in advance [whether they will lead to positive or
negative consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline} Instead, [we should
entertain a distinctly tragic vision of securitization that
council]{.underline}s [an ethic of **self-limitation**]{.underline}. The
core of this tragic vision is a recognition that the powerful allure of
using security talk to "gain control" over a situation will always be
present (Wæver 1995, 54). However, we should also recognize that this
control is always illusory because it presumes all of its effects can be
predetermined. The tragedy of securitization is that the failure to
recognize how contingency imposes limits on action lures political
actors into a false sense of certainty and the conviction that they can
determine the future. This leads to a hubristic adoption of "misplaced
certainty," such as when Vice President Dick Cheney declared in August
of 2002 that "there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of
mass destruction" (quoted in Mitzen and Schweller 2011, 3). A similar
situation emerged when Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld subsequently
claimed in November that the Iraq conflict could be "\[f\]ive days or
five weeks or five months, but it certainly isn't going to last any
longer than that" (Esterbrook 2002). A similarly misplaced certainty is
evident in US General Stanley McChrystal's assurances to the Obama
administration in 2009 that a surge in troops and resources were
critical to stave off American defeat in Afghanistan (Woodward 2009).
More recently, it is visible in President Donald Trump's 2018 assertion
that he was "100 percent right" on the weaknesses of the Iran nuclear
deal (CNN 2018).

Yet, tragedy cuts both ways. **[[Blanket
opposition]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to **securitizing
moves**]{.underline}]{.mark} can also [have unanticipated
effects]{.underline}. Ironically, the [desecuritization of an issue [may
not]{.mark} just [result in]{.mark} its
**[repoliticization]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} its
**[[disappearance from public view]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Floyd 2010,
57--58). [Viewing security discourse as negative also underplays how the
[**management of threats** can serve as a **focal point** for
**democratic cooperation** among different]{.mark} political
[actors]{.mark}]{.underline} (Roe 2012, 250, 257--58). The point is not
that every security discourse and the practices it justifies has
catastrophically perverse consequences. Instead, the goal is to
highlight a sensible restraint over the limits of seeing into the
future, how this shapes choice, and the dangers of hubris that follow.
[[When]{.underline}]{.mark} properly **[[adapted]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} this **[[constructivist
context]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the tragic vision of **[[securitization
can]{.mark} be an important tool in [cultivat]{.mark}ing prudence and
[restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}** (cf. Lebow 2003, 364).

The problem with this tragic vision is that it points to
[[processes]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[are
**never**]{.underline}]{.mark} entirely [[in our
possession]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Whether [in]{.mark} the form of
**[background knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Pouliot 2008),
**[[habits]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Hopf 2010), **[[or
routines]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Mitzen 2006), much of **[[social life
occurs without conscious deliberation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
reflection. These forms of unthinking action impair reflexivity and
limit actors' ability to see how the world might be different and thus
how outcomes can be uncertain. In some cases, this can be benign, such
as the unreflexive amity between Canada and the United States that
allows these countries to "escape" from the traditional security dilemma
(Collins 2014, 572--73). But just as practices of amity can be habitual,
so too can enmity. [The hawkish US senator may designate Iran's nuclear
program as threatening because that is what hawkish US senators do, and
there is no perceived way to be hawkish otherwise]{.underline}. The
result is that the uncertainty surrounding securitizing moves becomes
concealed under an unthinking veil of common sense. The tragedy of
securitization then is not only that political figures often exceed
their limitations by ignoring how contingency can derail securitizing
moves---it is that these limitations often never even register

This means overcoming the tragedy of securitization require a certain
degree self-reflexivity. This is similar to what Booth and Wheeler
describe as the "security dilemma sensibility," or an actor's ability
and willingness to reflect upon their actions, including one's own role
in provoking insecurity in others (2008, 7). By sensitizing leaders to
how uncertainty is an endemic feature of political life, and how their
actions can be interpreted in unintended ways, security competition can
be mitigated, at least in part (Booth and Wheeler 2008, 265). Yet, these
moments of self-awareness and [**[reflection]{.underline}** [are
difficult]{.underline}]{.mark} precisely [[because]{.mark} there are
powerful forces that demand simplicity and closure: namely our desire
for a stable sense of self or what is widely referred to as
**ontological security**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006). [Reflecting on the
[uncertainty]{.mark} of international politics [can erode **one's sense
of identity and agency**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [ultimately [leading to
a]{.mark} "deep, **[incapacitating state]{.mark} of not knowing how to
get by in the world**"]{.underline} (Mitzen and Schweller 2011, 29).
Booth and Wheeler's security dilemma sensibility may have the laudable
goal of alerting leaders to the role of uncertainty in political life,
but this confronts the problem that many would prefer that it remain
hidden.

The consequence is that this tragic aspect of the securitization dilemma
takes on an intractable character. Either unwilling or unable to "know
one's limits," as Herz would say (1950, 179), the role of uncertainty
becomes hidden and security claims appear as a reliable strategy for
control and influence. Like the classic realist dilemma, the
securitization dilemma is pervasive because it is often invisible. The
compelling need for a logic of selflimitation---of a careful and
reflective use of security language and how it can be derailed by
contingency--- is obscured because of an aversion to
recognizinguncertainty. It is this specter of a need for reflection and
restraint that may not be realized, I suggest, which demands that we
rethink the role of the analyst in provoking reflexivity among
power-holders.

Conclusion: Rethinking the Role of the Analyst

Motivated by the absence of unintended and perverse consequences in
constructivist theorizing of security, this article has pursued a
reconceptualization of the security dilemma. Viewing the dilemma as a
logic of limitation shaped by choice, uncertainty, and tragedy, the
argument focuses on transposing this logic to the constructivist context
of securitization theory. By showing how the choice to engage in the
social construction of threats is complicated by uncertainty and the
tragic failure to recognize one's own limits, the dilemma analytic helps
us to understand how securitization can be both a potent instrument for
mobilization, as well as a volatile source of unpredictability.
Moreover, this conceptual lens lays the foundation for an ethical
imperative of self-limitation among securitizing actors---albeit one
made difficult given the desire for simplicity and closure. Far from a
rebuke of constructivist theorizing, the argument shows that taking the
social character of security seriously means appreciating how political
claims are always vulnerable to being derailed by different types of
contingency.

This reconstructive move has important implications for studying the
social construction of security. First, while the initial influence of
realism on securitization theory is well-documented (Floyd 2010; Gad and
Peterson 2011), few attempts have been made to show how engaging with
these realist roots can yield new insights.22 Here, the reconstruction
of the security dilemma demonstrates how [returning to realist themes
can yield a fresh insights]{.underline}. Second, the argument pushes
scholars studying securitization to expand their universe of outcomes
beyond the reductive binary of success and failure and to consider cases
of perverse and unintended consequences. Not only are these outcomes
relatively common, they undercut the prevailing image of securitization
as a reliable technology of control. Third, the securitization dilemma
shows why uncertainty is more of an enduring problem for social action
than constructivists typically acknowledge. Contra earlier arguments
where learning and socialization effectively mitigate the problem of
uncertainty (Wendt 2006, 208--9), this perspective stresses how
contingency means that social acts like securitizing moves can have
unpredictable effects.

The most important result of this reconstruction, however, may be in how
taking the tragic element of the dilemma seriously reorders the
political role of the analyst. [[Rather than
assessing]{.underline}]{.mark} the validity of **[[a particular security
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[or exposing its socially
constructed nature]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[this
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark} asks the analyst to
[[provoke]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[reflexivity]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[on behalf of power-holders over the risks associated with
securitization]{.underline}. While this entails a bias toward
deescalation and desecuritization, unlike other approaches this is [[not
achieved through]{.underline}]{.mark} overt references to
[[an]{.underline}]{.mark}y liberal, democratic, or **[[emancipatory
ideal]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Instead]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[it
is packaged for power-holders as a strategy of
self-preservation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here, the analyst presents the
move to securitize as a risk-laden and potentially self-defeating
strategy. The analyst points to a series of precedents showing how such
a strategy can produce perverse consequences: how today\'s tough talk
can become tomorrow\'s liability; how audiences can interpret
threatening messages in unexpected ways; and how today\'s framing of
security can lead to perverse consequences tomorrow. By foregrounding
the problem of uncertainty, the analyst works to accentuate and impress
upon actors the dilemmatic quality of securitizing moves.

Yet, the problem with presenting the move to securitize as a risk is
that it may become accepted. Ironically, framing an escalation in enmity
as possible but dangerous is precisely what may legitimize such a move
in the eyes of risk-insensitive actors. This is Huysmans' (2002) now
familiar normative dilemma of writing security. The indeterminacy of
language means that political actors may interpret advice in
unpredictable ways. Frustratingly, this may include the precise opposite
of the analyst\'s intention. This situation is likely inescapable, but
it may be mitigated. What I suggest is that analysts should strive to
cultivate a deeper subjectivity of risk sensitivity, comparable to Booth
and Wheeler\'s security-dilemma sensibility, among political actors.

Key to this argument is how visions of the future satisfy the human
desire for certainty. As Berenskoetter argues, "visions depicting the
self in an imagined future order serve as anxiety controlling
mechanisms" (2011, 654). Visions of the future inoculate actors against
the anxiety of uncertainty by providing a narrative of where they are
going and how to get there. Indeed, normative debates on securitization
are already loaded with such visions. The impulse to securitize is
underpinned by a utopian future where the security frame can finally
mobilize a response to an otherwise intractable problem. Conversely, the
impulse to desecuritize is sustained by a dystopian future defined by
unrestrained authoritarian politics. A tragic vision of the future does
something different: it presents a future where the only thing we can
know decisively is that it is indeterminate and attempts to conclusively
control it are vulnerable to failure. The very recognition of
fundamental limits on human freedom (Steele 2007, 281--82) becomes
transformed into a source of ontological security. This tempers the
human need for cognitive closure by reconfiguring it into what Herz
understood as a "fundamentally humble posture toward the value and
precariousness of life" (Sylvest 2008, 442). **[[An actor with a]{.mark}
greater [sensitivity to indeterminacy may still pursue securitizing
moves, but with a cautious awareness that they are]{.mark} volatile acts
[best pursued sparingly]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[The analyst]{.mark}
does not simply educate political leaders by pointing to the
indeterminacy of the world; she seeks to [make]{.mark} political
[subjects]{.mark} more [sensitive]{.mark} toward it **[by crafting
visions of a precarious future]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Finally, this tragic vision cannot, and should not, escape its own need
for reflexivity. Its scholarly proponents need to engage in their own
process of self-reflection, focusing on how their knowledge and
interests are themselves historically situated. The ethic of restraint
is a value, and not necessarily the value for all historical
circumstances. A recognition of the social construction of security
"facts" must be sobered by a recognition of the social construction of
security "values" (Hamati-Ataya 2012, 685).
