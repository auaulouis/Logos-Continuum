#### The [OSCE]{.underline} fails\-\--they can't paper over [fundamental differences]{.underline} AND [Russian propaganda]{.underline} undermines their credibility

Why [the OSCE Is the **Wrong Platform**]{.underline} . . . for Now

[Despite]{.underline} these [indications]{.underline} of the positive
role the OSCE could play in resolving the current situation, [there are
**strong counterarguments**]{.underline}. The first is that
[**[Russia]{.underline}** [and the]{.underline}
**[West]{.underline}**]{.mark} [remain]{.underline} **[[too far apart on
basic positions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to]{.mark} make [use]{.mark}
of]{.underline} [the **[OSCE]{.underline}**]{.mark}'s good offices. As a
veteran U.S. diplomat and former OSCE mission head concluded, [the
organization, like]{.underline} **[any other]{.underline}** multilateral
institution, ["**reflects** the state of]{.underline}
**[relations]{.underline}** [among]{.underline} the
**[nations]{.underline}** [that make up]{.underline} its
[membership]{.underline}. [When relations are]{.underline}
**[good]{.underline}** or most of the member states are like-minded,
[the organization **works well**. When [relations
are]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[bad]{.underline}** [and there
are]{.underline} ]{.mark}[major]{.underline}
**[[disagreements]{.underline}]{.mark}** among members,
[[th]{.mark}at]{.underline} **[same [organization]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[will]{.underline} **[not function]{.underline}**]{.mark}[." For the
OSCE to serve as a]{.underline} useful [**platform for discussions**,
Russian officials and Western counterparts will need to come to Vienna
with the belief that it is **possible to bridge their divergent
positions**, and they must have an **idea** of **where common ground
might be found**. It is unclear whether]{.underline} the
**[faint]{.underline}** glimmer of **[optimism]{.underline}** after the
January 10 bilateral meeting between U.S. and Russian leaders in Geneva
[will]{.underline} **[endure]{.underline}**. While Deputy Secretary of
State Wendy Sherman and Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov remarked
on the serious and businesslike tone of the meeting, [**[little
headway]{.underline}** [was made to **narrow**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
negotiating **[margins]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The OSCE's new
chair-in-office, Polish foreign minister Zbigniew Rau, who assumed the
one-year position at the beginning of the year, has indicated his
readiness to hold a dialogue on a revised security paradigm---"provided
that countries do not violate existing norms in order to gain a
privileged position in such a discussion." [[Unless]{.underline}
**[Russia]{.underline}** **[drops]{.underline}**]{.mark} its more
strident **[[demands]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [negotiations in the
**OSCE**]{.underline} track [will yield the **same
results**]{.underline} as talks in Geneva and Brussels.

A second concern is [that]{.underline}
**[[disagreement]{.underline}]{.mark}** on fundamental principles [could
[lead]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[crisis]{.mark} within the
organization]{.underline}**. In its recent proposals to the United
States and NATO, and in statements by top officials, [Russia offered
far-fetched interpretations of "indivisible security" according to which
Ukraine's right to apply for membership in NATO presents a "legitimate"
threat to Russia's security interests]{.underline}. However, [its
disregard of]{.underline} the **[specific commitments]{.underline}**
outlined in the Decalogue [suggests]{.underline} that [Moscow is
inclined to view comprehensive security as a]{.underline} **[rhetorical
fig leaf]{.underline}** [rather than a]{.underline} **[shared
principle]{.underline}** [guiding]{.underline}
**[relations]{.underline}** between states. Accordingly, [if OSCE
participating states were to engage in a deep, formal discussion of
these principles, it is **unclear** whether they would be able to reach
**consensus**]{.underline} on previous shared positions that heretofore
were considered the least common denominator. [Parallels between the
current context and the ill-fated Corfu Process of 2008--2010, which
ultimately led to a "near death experience" for the OSCE, will likely
prompt]{.underline} several [delegations to]{.underline} **[refrain from
convening for a summit]{.underline}** [to consider existential questions
regarding European security]{.underline}.

Finally, [[Russia has]{.underline} **[systematically undermined public
confidence in the OSCE]{.underline}** [through]{.underline}
**[disinformation]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[obstructionism]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In recent years, Russia [has
leveled]{.underline} **[accusations of bias]{.underline}** [against the
OSCE]{.underline}, particularly its Special Monitoring Mission to
Ukraine (SMM), which was established in 2014 to report objectively on
the situation in the country at a time when "little green men" began to
appear in Crimea. Russian [officials and press outlets frequently accuse
the organization of **ignoring** alleged violations by **Ukrainian
authorities**]{.underline}, but in reality, many of these allegations
are hyperbolized or cannot be corroborated according to the mission's
strict reporting standards. Elsewhere, [Russia undermined the
organization's long-standing effort to achieve a political resolution
to]{.underline} the **[Nagorno-Karabakh]{.underline}** dispute [by
**unilaterally**]{.underline} [brokering a]{.underline} **[hasty
ceasefire]{.underline}** agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan in
2020, [despite serving as a lead facilitator of OSCE peace
talks]{.underline}. Further **[examples abound]{.underline}**. [The
[Kremlin]{.mark}'s tendency to **[undermine the OSCE]{.mark}**,
[cast]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[aspersions on its
cred]{.underline}**]{.mark}ibility, [and [question]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[its **[competence]{.mark}**]{.underline} [when it cannot
be]{.underline} **[manipulated]{.underline}** to serve Moscow's aims
[has taken a]{.underline} **[toll]{.underline}** [on the organization's
reputation, particularly in]{.underline} [**Russia**. This makes it more
difficult for an OSCE-brokered outcome to be presented to the public or
to be respected by officials and military leaders in
Russia]{.underline}.

#### Perm do both\-\--regulatory fora are [complimentary]{.underline}, NOT [competitive]{.underline}

Daniel **Mügge 21**, Professor of Political Arithmetic at the University
of Amsterdam, "Cooperation á la carte is the way forward for EU AI
regulation," London School of Economics, 11/26/2021,
https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2021/11/26/cooperation-a-la-carte-is-the-way-forward-for-eu-ai-regulation/

Earlier this year, the EU became the first major jurisdiction to publish
a set of draft rules for artificial intelligence (AI). [There
are]{.underline} good [reasons to keep]{.underline} close legislative
[tabs on AI **tech**]{.underline}nology. Concerns range from algorithmic
discrimination and distorted democracy to ubiquitous surveillance and
outright oppression.

Beyond these questions loom deeper concerns. A world saturated with
machines able to predict and exploit our fears and desires fundamentally
challenges human autonomy. At the same time, AI-led automation has the
potential to deprive many people of their jobs once the government
debt-fuelled post-pandemic boom peters out. Already, automation has
driven a wedge between the upper and lower echelons of labour markets.
Aided by smart machines, many highly educated workers have seen their
productivity rise, while jobs with more routine tasks, in contrast, have
slowly disappeared.

The European Commission proudly touts a European third way on AI
regulation: rather than letting algorithms serve the state (as in China)
or large corporations (as in the United States), the Brussels approach
aims to put them at the service of people -- 'trustworthy AI', as the EU
slogan puts it. This entails curtailing the freedom afforded to the
masters of AI -- be they governments or companies.

This European approach will encounter two key obstacles. First, by most
measures the EU tech sector already lags those in China and America.
Slamming the breaks on AI applications is bound to widen that gap. After
all, algorithms thrive on 'learning by doing'. The creation of a
European data space and coordinated seed investment by EU member states
is meant to boost the homegrown sector. But whether that's enough to
make European AI more than a sideshow on the global stage is anybody's
guess.

Second, American politicians and pundits alike increasingly frame AI as
a security issue. Earlier this year, the final report issued by the US
National Security Commission on AI portrayed AI as a tech race between
China and the United States, with the loser vulnerable to the winner's
AI supremacy. Such a dog-eat-dog tech world has little patience for the
finer points of AI ethics. Hence, the report implies that Europeans
would be well-advised to climb into the passenger seat of a US-led
alliance of 'freedom-loving' tech powers and leave the steering to
Washington and Silicon Valley.

These forces are pulling European states in opposite directions. Ethical
concerns inspire caution, competitiveness concerns encourage European
boldness, while the security-framing of AI suggests Europe should play a
junior role in a Western alliance. So, what is the way forward?

Cooperation á la carte

[[Much]{.mark} of the current **[debate]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the global
dynamics of [AI]{.mark} regulation [is **unduly simplistic**]{.mark},
treating 'AI regulation' as]{.underline} though it were [a]{.underline}
**[single, monolithic block,]{.underline}** to be
[approached]{.underline} **[either]{.underline}** alone or [in
cooperation with **one**]{.underline} **[or]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} **[other partner]{.underline}**. [Instead, [a
**nuanced** perspective would]{.mark}]{.underline} be to [[recognise the
**enormous breadth**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark} uses and
**[[regulatory concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}** currently [lumped under
the AI-heading.]{.underline}

To be sure, with open economic borders the effectiveness of European AI
rules hinges on what other major jurisdictions do -- the AI field is
rife with 'regulatory interdependence'. What good are EU rules against
invisible discrimination in automated CV-sorting when clients can simply
use US-based services instead? What good are tight privacy rules when we
can import AI systems trained on data unethically harvested from
citizens abroad?

Yet this regulatory interdependence is variegated: in some domains --
say, the global spread of automated weapons systems -- the EU is
entirely dependent on cooperation with other major powers. In others,
such as safety standards for self-driving cars, it can craft its own
rules and testing procedures, quite irrespective of what others do.
[Some applications, such as the resilience of AI-powered infrastructure,
have direct relevance for **NATO**]{.underline} [as a **security**
alliance]{.underline}; **[others]{.underline}**, like rules for
Twitter-algorithms or automated loan approval, [are]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** [security-relevant **at all**]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline} **[[variegated regulatory
interdependence]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- high in some cases, low in
others -- [[invites a **differentiated approach to global AI
regulation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Where global standards might align
with European regulatory goals, they are clearly preferrable. When such
agreement is out of reach, second-best options emerge: mini-lateral
solutions such as shared standards crafted in the newly minted
Transatlantic Technology Council. Mutual recognition of different but
equally stringent standards are also an option, as is support for
private tech-industry standards.

But where EU ethical goals are best served by Brussels forging ahead on
its own -- as it did with the General Data Protection Regulation -- it
should have the courage to do so. [There is **no reason
to**]{.underline} think the EU will [be]{.underline} well-[served by a
**one-size-fits-all-AI-uses**]{.underline} [approach to international
regulatory cooperation. It should not blindly give in to the '**are you
with us or against us' logic prominent in American
thinking**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
**[[diverse]{.underline}]{.mark}** ethical [**[trade-offs]{.mark}** AI
raises [weigh too **heavily** to be tackled]{.mark} **well** [in a
**uniform**]{.mark} international [mould]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Always heedful of which approach allows it to maximise its digital
sovereignty on any particular issue, the EU should cooperate where
feasible and dare to go it alone where it must. [[Such an]{.mark} **á la
carte**]{.underline} [[approach]{.mark} to global regulation [has
**served**]{.mark}]{.underline} the EU [**[well]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline} **[many]{.underline}** other
**[fields]{.underline}**]{.mark}, from finance and food safety to
pharmaceuticals. [There is no reason to think it would fail in relation
to AI.]{.underline}

### OSCE CP\-\--NATO Key\-\--Interop

#### NATO is key\-\--they have unique institutions for facilitating legal interoperability

[One vital and unique contribution for [NATO]{.mark} is
[facilitat]{.mark}ing **[legal interop]{.mark}erability**]{.underline}
[among]{.underline} the [Allies [to]{.mark}
[resolve]{.mark}]{.underline} some of [the most **[pressing legal
barriers]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for AI implementation [in
**future**]{.mark}]{.underline} Allied
**[[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Legal
interoperability]{.underline}, a subset of larger coalition
interoperability, [refers to the **operational
coordination**]{.underline} [around]{.underline} [partner]{.underline}
legal [obligations and interpretations]{.underline}.75 [It ensures "that
within a military alliance, military operations can be conducted
**effectively**]{.underline} **[consistent]{.underline}** [with
the]{.underline} [legal **obligations** of **each
nation**]{.underline}."76 [Legal [interop]{.mark}erability [is
a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[critical component of multilateral
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[that]{.mark}
ha[s]{.mark}]{.underline} thus far [been]{.underline}
**[under-examined]{.underline}**, [despite its **[central]{.mark}ity**
[to **successful military
op**]{.mark}**eration[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} largely [because]{.underline} "[legal factors have a
**bearing**]{.underline} [on]{.underline} **[everything]{.underline}**
[in alliances and coalition operations---from determining basic
'troop-to-task' considerations to decisions regarding the **targets** to
be **engaged**]{.underline}---[and]{.underline} the **[types of
ordinances]{.underline}** [that may be used]{.underline}."77

[To **enhance**]{.underline} legal [interoperability, [NATO can
**exert**]{.mark} its **[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline} [on how Allies
can develop and deploy AI consistent [with]{.mark} their [**legal
obligations** through]{.mark}]{.underline} [its **[unique
standardization capacities]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Historically, [NATO
has taken significant steps to bridge the legal gap]{.underline} between
Allies [on critical procedures]{.underline} that bridge responsible
state behavior with such "troop-to-task" considerations. [One
instructive example]{.underline} from past operations [is **detention
policies**]{.underline} in non-international armed conflicts.78 The
[promulgation of]{.underline} **[detention standards]{.underline}**
[illustrates the]{.underline} **[operational significance]{.underline}**
[of NATO's common legal procedures, even for coalitions of the
willing]{.underline} that **[formally]{.underline}** operate
**[outside]{.underline}** [NATO structures]{.underline}. By way of
background, the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan had internal debates
regarding the 96-hour security detention time period.79 The United
States advocated extending the 96-hour rule, where coalition partners
insisted adhering to the NATO standard, even though it was not a NATO
operation.80 Generally the detention example illustrates NATO legal
standards providing clarity to non-NATO operations; in some cases,
Allies adopt NATO standards as accepted thresholds that continue to
inform coalition policies beyond NATO structures and operations.

[Implementing]{.underline} **[AI]{.underline}** [in future military
operations will]{.underline} almost certainly **[complicate legal
interoperability]{.underline}** [as there is a]{.underline} **[lack of
uniform standards]{.underline}**, [as in]{.underline} the
[detention]{.underline} example. [Even some]{.underline} of the more
**[basic]{.underline}** [implementation measures will
garner]{.underline} **[legal uncertainty]{.underline}** [and Allies
will]{.underline} [inevitably navigate with **minimal legal
clarity**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[no standard
procedure]{.underline}**s. [Despite]{.underline} the [roots of the legal
debate stemming from the question of lethality, the most]{.underline}
**[pressing]{.underline}** ([and]{.underline} **[urgent]{.underline}**)
[legal issues will address the **integration**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} [**necessary AI-enablers**, such as
**data**]{.underline} gathering and **[sharing]{.underline}**.

Furthermore, [[NATO has]{.underline} **[coordinated
initiatives]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to promote awareness of Allies'
legal obligations [and has a **dedicated office**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[focusing on]{.underline} **[legality]{.underline}**]{.mark}[.
This]{.underline} **[[centralizes]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[institutional capacity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to focus on alignment
not only [between]{.mark} the [policies of **NATO Allies**]{.mark}, but
coherence with the]{.underline} **[international community [more
broadly]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Among others, the NATO Legal
Practitioners' Workshop and inter-organizational dialogue between NATO,
the UN, and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the
latter of which has a delegation to NATO that provides legal training
and education to practitioners.81 [The NATO]{.underline} **[Office of
Legal Affairs]{.underline}** (OLA) itself [can also play a]{.underline}
**[central role]{.underline}** [in navigating]{.underline} the
**[challenges]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} legal
[**interoperability**. As the example of]{.underline}
**[detention]{.underline}** standards [illustrates, [NATO]{.mark}
ha[s]{.mark} been]{.underline} **[[successful]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[in]{.mark} implementing legal standards which translated into
**[operational clarity and coalition policy outside NATO
operations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As part of its focus on responsibility in its EDT agenda, [NATO has
opportunities to facilitate AI legal standard-setting and coalition
policies to ensure safer and responsible use of AI in Allied
operations]{.underline}.

### OSCE CP\-\--NATO Key\-\--OSCE Fails

#### The OSCE [fails]{.underline}\-\--it can't mediate conflicts if the parties aren't open to mediation. 

Philip **Remler 21**, nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, "The OSCE as Sisyphus: Mediation, Peace Operations,
Human Rights," Istituto Affari Internazionali (IAI), 2021, JSTOR,
https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep30942

Over the past decade, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in
Europe (**[OSCE]{.underline}**) [has]{.underline} unwillingly [been
returning to its origins as a Cold War--era Conference]{.underline} -- a
forum [where states and blocs, often **antagonistic to one
another**]{.underline} [and espousing **opposing ideals**, can **air
their frictions and hostilities and look for ways to overcome
them**]{.underline}.

A brief historical review is necessary. The Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) established by the 1975 Helsinki Final Act
was one manifestation of Europe's aspiration to establish an
international order to keep the peace and, as Andrei Sakharov wrote in
his Nobel speech that year, to stress "the link between defense of peace
and defense of human rights".1

However, the CSCE was created without the legal personality other
international organisations possessed, and operated on the principle of
consensus -- i.e., all "participating States" (members) must agree to
every decision. The lack of legal personality, a US demand at the time,
prevented the development of a strong executive and professional cadre
along UN lines, and made such basic operational issues as diplomatic
immunities and customs clearances dependent upon individual states. The
consensus principle, advocated by the Soviet Union, blocked most unified
action except in narrowly defined and relatively uncontroversial areas.
To this day, these two characteristics render the organisation heavily
dependent on and constrained by its participating States.

The end of the Cold War temporarily loosened those constraints and after
1989 the CSCE flowered in the prevailing spirit of pan-European
cooperation. Consensus was the norm, allowing the OSCE to establish
missions throughout the former Soviet Union and Balkans despite the
absence of legal personality. Based on the Charter of Paris (1990),
accepted by all participating States, the CSCE eventually became the
OSCE in 1994 and acted as an executive organisation in matters of
mediation, peace operations and the promotion of human rights and
democratic governance. Russia even allowed the OSCE to establish a
mission in 1995 in wartorn Chechnya; and the Office of Democratic
Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) deployed election monitoring
missions in states that had not held free elections in living memory, if
ever.

The lack of legal personality and requirement for consensus were moot --
for a time. But as attitudes towards Charter of Paris commitments
fragmented over the last decade, these constraints resurfaced, shrinking
the OSCE's room for manoeuvre. Missions closed, mediation -- never very
successful -- returned to individual states, and the promotion of human
rights and democratic governance met a backlash that brought the
organisation to a standstill. In essence, the OSCE is returning to its
origins as a permanent forum for dialogue only -- with extremely
constrained executive action capabilities -- among states and blocs,
often hostile toward one another.

The OSCE's efforts span a broad range of activities within the three
"dimensions" of its original mandate: security and political-military
affairs (with an emphasis on mediation), economics/environment and the
"human dimension", including human rights and governance. The three
overlap and "cross-dimensional" activities are frequent. Conflict
mediation, peace operations and the promotion of human rights and
democracy remain among OSCE's most important activities to this day and
offer evidence to assess the state of the organisation.

1\. Mediation

**[Mediation]{.underline}** [became]{.underline}
**[crucial]{.underline}** [to OSCE efforts]{.underline} in the 1990s
[with the outbreak of **armed conflicts**]{.underline} in the wake of
the Soviet collapse. [The OSCE has mediated]{.underline} in **[several
"frozen conflicts" in the former Soviet space]{.underline}**
([namely]{.underline} **[Karabakh]{.underline}** in Azerbaijan, **[South
Ossetia]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Abkhazia]{.underline}** in
Georgia [and]{.underline} **[Transdniestria]{.underline}** in Moldova)
[and in **Ukraine**]{.underline}, a conflict that was on its way to
becoming frozen even as intense fighting raged. As an OSCE Head of
Mission succinctly put it, "[the conflicts themselves are not frozen --
only the **peace processes** are]{.underline}".2 The last ten years have
seen progress through international mediation in only one of the four
"traditional" frozen conflicts listed below. Because the OSCE's efforts
regarding the conflict in Ukraine are so bound up with its observer
deployments there, they will be examined in the following section on
peace operations.

Azerbaijan, Armenia and the Karabakh conflict: The Karabakh conflict
began in 1988 and intensified to full-scale military operations in 1992,
ending in Armenian military victory and a ceasefire in 1994 that left
the Karabakh Armenians in control of large areas of Azerbaijan but
without international recognition.3 Large-scale hostilities broke out
again briefly in April 2016 and for an extended period between September
and November 2020, during which Azerbaijan reclaimed lands it had lost
and the southern part of Nagornyy Karabakh.4

In 1992 the Italian CSCE Chair-in-Office attempted to convene a Minsk
Conference to resolve the conflict. It never met: the sides imposed
mutually contradictory conditions for participating. The Chair then
created a Minsk Group to steer negotiations. The Group's co-chairs --
Russia, France and the United States (US) since 1997 -- took over its
functions, but in practice acted autonomously on behalf of their three
countries, not the OSCE. After Dmitry Medvedev assumed the Russian
presidency in 2008, Russia came to dominate the mediation process.
Medvedev, eager for foreign affairs accomplishments in what he called
Russia's "sphere of privileged interests", mediated negotiations between
Armenia's Serzh Sargsyan and Azerbaijan's Ilham Aliyev, convening them
to eleven summits during his presidency. The US and French co-chairs
became passive. They helped prepare papers for the negotiations and
received debriefs afterwards but played no role in the meetings
themselves. After the failure of Medvedev's final attempt in Kazan in
2011, the Minsk Group ceased to play a significant role. It made no
contribution to mediation following either the April 2016 fighting or
the more recent hostilities in September--November 2020, in both of
which Russia mediated unilaterally. After the 2020 war, Azerbaijan's
President Aliyev bluntly stated that the OSCE Minsk Group played no role
in resolving the conflict.5

Georgia and the Abkhazia/South Ossetia conflicts: Hostilities broke out
in both regions with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late 1991.
By 1993 Russianbacked separatists had emerged victorious and forced
Georgia to accept Russian peacekeeping forces. Since then the sides in
these conflicts have never engaged in good-faith negotiations on a
political settlement. The CSCE was mandated to lead mediation in South
Ossetia and deployed unarmed military monitors there; in Abkhazia it
assisted the United Nations (UN), which mediated negotiations and
maintained a large observer mission mandated only to observe Russian
peacekeepers. After the 2008 Russia-Georgia war, Russia recognised both
separatist polities as independent states and blocked renewal of both
the UN and OSCE mandates. Those missions closed. The European Union (EU)
Monitoring Mission in Georgia took on the patrolling function in October
2008.

Since then, the OSCE has co-chaired the Geneva International Discussions
(along with the UN and the EU) and the Incident Prevention and Response
Mechanism, which meets in Ergneti, near the Georgian--South Ossetian
frontline. Neither forum covers political resolution of the conflicts.
They deal with day-to-day security and humanitarian issues. The most
political issue is the process of "borderisation": Russian peacekeepers
fencing off territory previously controlled by Tbilisi. In 2014--15,
following the Crimea crisis, Russia concluded treaties that integrated
significant executive authorities of the entities into the respective
Russian government institutions, including the foreign affairs, military
and security apparatuses.6 This crypto-annexation has put the process of
resolving the overarching political conflict into a further deep-freeze.

Transdniestria conflict: 7 In 1991 pro-Soviet forces, fearing that
Moldova would unify with Romania, declared independence on the left bank
of the Dniester River. A short war followed in which Russian and local
forces secured the separation of Transdniestria from the rest of Moldova
and the deployment of a Russian peacekeeping force to protect it.
Communication between populaces on both sides of the river remained
robust, however, with constant crossings for family visits, commerce,
education and transit. Because the lack of a settlement caused little
inconvenience and there has been no threat of resumed combat, there has
been correspondingly little impetus to reach a compromise settlement. In
2003, while official negotiations were ongoing mediated by the OSCE,
Russia and Ukraine, Russia opened a secret second channel of
negotiations, aiming to secure peace on its own terms, including
favourable geopolitical orientation and military basing rights in
Moldova. The attempt failed. In 2006 official negotiations were broken
off.

The past decade has seen some progress from OSCE mediation between the
two banks of the Dniester, as well as repeated Russian attempts to
bypass the "5+2" process in which Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE mediate,
with the US and the EU participating as observers. Before 2009, the
Communist government in Moldova tried to persuade outside powers to
force unconditional capitulation on Transdniestria. From 2009, when a
pro-European government gained power, the OSCE focused its attention on
laying the groundwork for renewing official negotiations: promoting
one-on-one meetings between the two sides' negotiators, resurrecting
moribund sectoral working groups, hosting conferences with security
officials from both sides in Germany and Austria, and working with the
EU and United Kingdom (UK) on dialogue projects.

In June 2011, Russia tried once again to bypass the OSCE and broker a
peace unilaterally. The attempt failed when Russia's negotiator
circulated three different -- and mutually contradictory -- draft
declarations within ten days.8 Soon thereafter, in September 2011, the
OSCE persuaded the leaders of Moldova and Transdniestria to restart
official negotiations. This success, however, owed more to the leaders
themselves than to the OSCE. Moldovan premier Vlad Filat was willing to
ignore his cabinet and advisors to meet Transdniestrian leader Igor
Smirnov at Bad Reichenhall, in Germany. For his part, Smirnov was aware
that Russia wanted to oust him and would oppose him in upcoming
Transdniestrian "presidential" elections, and he therefore sought
support from the West. On such a flimsy basis, the renewed negotiations
went nowhere: Smirnov was out a few months later. His successor, more
obedient to Russia, obstructed progress. The OSCE redoubled its efforts,
especially under the German chair in 2016. Much progress has been made
on the "packet" under discussion since then, but that packet consists of
humanitarian and confidence-building measures that may improve the lives
of people on both sides of the river but do not comprise a comprehensive
resolution of the conflict.

That episode illustrates several important points: mediators do not make
peace, the sides in conflict do (indeed, mediators who are also involved
in the conflict, and therefore also have a stake in the outcome, can
play a negative role). The willingness of the sides' leaders to make
peace is wholly dependent on their calculations of what will preserve
and increase their power. Humanitarian and confidence-building measures
do not threaten the power or lives of leaders. While they do not settle
conflicts, negotiating them is valuable for three reasons: 1) the
measures themselves have intrinsic value; 2) they give the sides a stake
in, and familiarity with, the negotiations that produce them, preparing
the sides to move on to more substantive negotiations; and 3)
negotiating these measures gives sides a forum for raising their
concerns, which can prevent or delay a recurrence of active hostilities.

2\. Peace operations: The case of Ukraine

A peacekeeping role has often been raised for the CSCE/OSCE, first in
1992 with the suggestion of "Yellow Beret" OSCE peacekeepers for the
Karabakh conflict. OSCE observers were deployed in the South Ossetia
conflict from 1992 to 2008. An OSCE Chair's Personal Representative
participated in a supporting role in implementing the Dayton Accords for
Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1995 to 2015. The OSCE rapidly deployed an
international police presence to Kyrgyzstan during widespread unrest in
2010.

The OSCE peace operations in Ukraine since the crisis erupted in 2014 --
the Special Monitoring Mission (SMM), the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG)
and the Observer Mission at the Russian Checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk
(OM) are, together, the largest endeavour the OSCE has undertaken in the
last decade, and perhaps the most consequential. Today they deploy over
700 monitors from 44 OSCE participating States. The military and
political situation changed rapidly in 2014-- 15, with armed hostilities
in eastern Ukraine falling into three phases: "hybrid war", Ukrainian
"anti-terrorist operations" and a Russian-backed counter-offensive.
Finally, the conflict cooled into a simmering pattern of ceasefires with
frequent violations.

Flexibility was the key to the SMM's transitions through these phases.
It was created before armed hostilities broke out in eastern Ukraine.
Negotiations on forming a mission for national reconciliation began on 2
March 2014. By 21 March, when the OSCE Permanent Council authorised the
SMM, unrest was engulfing much of eastern Ukraine and Russia had annexed
Crimea. The project staff quickly found themselves becoming conflict
monitors. Russia's price for agreeing to the deployment was barring the
SMM from Crimea. The monitors were not allowed to operate in areas along
the Russian border and had no enforcement powers. The OSCE's lack of a
legal personality meant that the SMM had to use the umbrella of the NATO
office in Kyiv merely to open a bank account.

The Mission's initial reporting9 describes the outbreak of civil unrest:
on 1 March in Donetsk, on 6 April in Luhansk and Kharkiv, on 12 April in
Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, and by 17 April in Mariupol. Civil unrest
quickly turned into what came to be known as a "hybrid war".10 In
Ukraine the term meant Russian "little green men" (that is, Russian
military units operating on the ground without insignia) and pro-Russian
separatist forces hiding among activists, pretending to be Ukrainian
civilians as they took over city governments by occupying buildings. A
campaign of this type depends for success on the target state treating
all opposing forces -- fighters and civilian protestors alike -- as
fellow citizens and refraining from using force against them. On 17
April the foreign relations chiefs of Ukraine, Russia, the United States
and the European Union met in Geneva. Their statement called for
de-escalation measures and called upon the SMM to play a leading role in
helping Ukrainian and local authorities implement them.11 Daily SMM
reports track the spread of unrest fomented by "armed opponents of the
central government".12 Although the government in Kyiv announced that it
was engaged in an "antiterrorist operation",13 this appears to have been
aimed at militarily useful objectives outside the main towns, such as
airfields, leaving city administration buildings in the hands of
"activists".

The hybrid war stage ended abruptly on 2 May, when in Odessa Ukrainian
proMaidan forces, including "Right Sector" militants, treated "little
green men" and anti-Maidan civilian protestors alike as armed invaders,
not citizens. Forty-two burned to death in the building they had
occupied.14 Over the next few weeks SMM teams mostly reported
consolidation of the sides: the separatists strengthened their hold over
parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, while Ukrainian authorities
regained control over cities outside those regions.

The second phase of the conflict began in late May with heavy clashes in
the Donetsk region as Ukrainian "anti-terrorist" operations began in
earnest. Repercussions for the SMM were immediate. On 26 May,
separatists detained four SMM observers based in Donetsk. On 29 May,
four observers based in Luhansk were taken prisoner. Both teams spent
the next month in captivity.15 On 28 May, eleven observers were detained
west of Donetsk, but were released later the same day. The SMM made a
point of continuing its work in both regions, demonstrating the
international community's resolve not to be intimidated. As clashes
increased, the mission gradually changed from observing hybrid war to
monitoring full-scale hostilities.

Initially, Ukrainian forces met with some success, leading Russia to
accept international talks in the Normandy Format (France, Germany,
Ukraine and Russia) on 6 June. That meeting in turn led to an 8 June
meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group (OSCE, Russia, Ukraine), chaired
by the experienced Russian-speaking Swiss diplomat Heidi Tagliavini, who
was appointed as special representative by the OSCE's Swiss
Chair-in-Office. Thus the OSCE, which had a presence on the ground in
eastern Ukraine, was tasked with conducting the day-to-day negotiations
that Germany and France had put in motion. Petro Poroshenko, elected
president of Ukraine on 5 May, took office on 7 June and by 20 June had
proposed a peace plan. Peace negotiations began in earnest, paving the
way for the 27--28 June release of the two groups of OSCE observers who
had been held captive by separatists since late May.

Russia took steps, however, to roll back Ukraine's advances on the
battlefield. The third phase of the conflict was marked by a more or
less open (though rigorously denied) Russian military presence in
Donetsk and Luhansk. Moscow sent both personnel and heavy weapons across
the border. As the Russian presence grew, the separatists were able to
reverse Ukrainian gains. An early event of this new stage was the
downing of a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine on 17 July 2014, killing
all 298 persons aboard. A Dutch Safety Board forensic investigation,
granted access through OSCE intervention, confirmed that the cause was
an anti-aircraft missile from a Russian-military BUK system spotted
earlier in the hands of separatists. The Dutch Ministry of Justice later
identified and charged some alleged perpetrators.16 Energised by the
atrocity, the international community again deputised the OSCE. The OSCE
Permanent Council decided on 18 July to deploy observers to two Russian
crossing posts, Gukovo and Donetsk, on the separatist-controlled part of
the border between Ukraine and Russia to observe traffic between Russia
and the separatists.17 However, the observers were limited to static
posts.

Diplomatic efforts continued over the summer in the Trilateral Contact
Group (TCG). Observers believe the driving force came from Germany,
which was careful never to give the impression that it was acting
unilaterally so as not to raise historical memories and suspicions.
France was Germany's partner in the Normandy Format and the OSCE was the
face of the West in the TCG. On 5 September 2014, the TCG signed the
Minsk Protocol, which established a ceasefire in place and mandated
autonomy talks for Donbas under Ukrainian law. However, the ceasefire
left a Ukrainian salient at Debaltseve, a rail and road junction
controlling traffic between Luhansk and Donetsk. In January 2015 a
Russian-backed offensive began that over the next month encircled,
besieged and shelled the town; the US charged that Russian artillery was
responsible for the shelling.18 A Normandy Format meeting in Minsk
proclaimed another ceasefire on 12 February 2015 ("Minsk II"), but the
offensive continued until Ukrainian troops abandoned Debaltseve on 18
February.

Throughout this period the SMM patrolled in zones of combat and
shelling, staying in close touch with both the Ukrainian military and
the Joint Control and Coordination Commission (JCCC) set up between
Ukrainian and Russian military authorities. The SMM reported extensively
on shelling of civilians by both sides as well as movements of heavy
weapons to the separatists.19 The SMM enhanced its capabilities in
October 2014 by deploying uncrewed aerial vehicles to places
inaccessible to patrols.20 The SMM thus adapted to the outbreak of
full-scale combat by reporting objectively on what both combatant sides
would have preferred to remain lost in the fog of war.

After new frontlines stabilised in Donbas, the role of the OSCE began to
resemble other frozen conflicts, albeit with failures of successive
ceasefires, widespread ceasefire violations and continued casualties.21
The SMM and OM monitored and reported to the international community;
the TCG, meeting every two weeks, negotiated on day-to-day issues; and
the SMM liaised with the Joint Control and Coordination Commission --
which took on the form of combined military commissions seen in other
frozen conflicts, e.g., the Joint Control Commission in the
Transdniestria conflict.

This frozen-conflict system was disturbed in 2016, during Germany's term
as OSCE Chair-in-Office, when foreign minister and OSCE Chair
Frank-Walter Steinmeier cast aside Germany's usual behind-the-scenes
approach and proposed a formula for holding elections according to
Ukrainian law in separatist-controlled areas. The OSCE would monitor the
elections, and if it judged them to be free and fair, an interim
self-governing status would be initiated in exchange for the return of
Ukrainian control over its borders. Despite some back and forth, and
endorsement in 2019 by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the
initiative failed; the separatists ignored the formula and held their
own unrecognised elections in 2018.

To summarise, through the SMM, the Observer Mission at the border points
and the TCG, the OSCE has performed a valuable service since 2014 in
maintaining and managing the international involvement in a dangerous
conflict in the heart of Europe and keeping the international community
informed. Flexibility and nimble navigation of bureaucratic procedures
allowed for quick deployment and rapid adaptation to changing
politico-military environments. The OSCE was able to give institutional
support to the Normandy process and, through the TCG, to blunt
suspicions of German leadership. One factor for success was Russia's
continued view of the OSCE as neutral -- according to one analyst, the
first Russian officers to participate in the JCCC even wore OSCE
armbands.22 This contrasted sharply with Russia's evolving assessment of
the EU. In 2008 Russia agreed to EU observers in the wake of its war
with Georgia. With Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency, the
Russian government adopted the view, previously limited to the
military/security services, that the EU was a rival, not a partner.

But the SMM came at a cost. Just as the OSCE gave Germany a multilateral
screen, it did the same for Russia, lending a veneer of legitimacy to
Russia's assertion that it was a mediator, not a belligerent. Russia
also limited SMM/OM activity: Russia's proxies in Donbas constrained and
intimidated the SMM; and while static observers could see groups of men
of military age and bearing crossing the border, heavy weapons later
seen inside Ukraine entered through crossings beyond their view.

3\. Democracy and human rights

In 2020 the OSCE underwent a leadership crisis. The terms of the four
leaders of its premier institutions -- the Secretary General, the
Director of the ODIHR, the High Commissioner on National Minorities
(HCNM) and the Representative on Freedom of the Media (RFoM) -- expired
in July. They had been appointed three years earlier in a package deal,
and their renewal was expected by consensus. But on 11 June, Azerbaijan
announced that it would oppose renewing the RFoM, the French politician
Harlem Désir, for his "excessive criticism" of the state of free speech
in Azerbaijan.23 Turkey and Tajikistan followed by opposing the renewal
of ODIHR Director Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir, an Icelandic politician;
ODIHR had often targeted those countries on human rights grounds. In
retaliation France and Iceland, supported by Canada, Norway and Armenia,
vetoed extensions for Secretary General Thomas Greminger, a Swiss
diplomat; and HCNM Lamberto Zannier, the Italian diplomat who had
previously served two terms as OSCE Secretary General.24 The OSCE's
institutions were thus left leaderless for six months, until a new
package deal to fill the posts was reached on 4 December at the OSCE's
annual Ministerial Council meeting in Tirana.25

What caused this crisis? ODIHR had been critical of human rights and
elections practices since its inception in 1991; the RFoM had been
criticising the persecution of journalists since 1998; and their
criticisms had frequently caused irritation in OSCE participating
States, especially those "east of Vienna". But no state had ever blown
up the process of choosing a slate of leaders for the institutions. What
led Azerbaijan -- followed quickly by others -- to take this step?

To answer this question, we must look back to the OSCE's origins. The
Helsinki Final Act of 1975 represented a grand bargain between East and
West. The Soviet Union achieved recognition of its sphere of influence:
its political, economic and security bloc in Eastern and Central Europe.
In return, the West received Eastern recognition that respect for human
rights was a universal obligation and therefore that human rights
anywhere were of legitimate concern everywhere. 26 By the end of World
War II, democracy had become the only legitimate form of governance --
had it not been, the "Democratic" People's Republic of Korea and the
German "Democratic" Republic would have chosen different names -- but
the Helsinki Final Act, adopted while Leonid Brezhnev ruled the Soviet
Union, makes no mention of democracy or the rule of law. That was
remedied in 1990 by the adoption of the Paris Charter.27 As new states
emerged and joined the CSCE/OSCE, they, too, assumed the Charter's
commitments to democratic governance, rule of law and respect for human
rights as universal ideals -- the price of admission to a Europewide
organisation in which small states could speak on equal footing with the
large.

To actualise those ideals, the Charter established many of the OSCE's
current institutions: the Secretariat, the Conflict Prevention Centre
and the Permanent Council (originally the Committee of Senior
Officials), all now in Vienna; and a Committee for Free Elections (now
ODIHR) in Warsaw. The Charter mandated a Geneva conference in 1991 that
led to the creation of the office of the High Commissioner on National
Minorities in The Hague. It mandated the parliamentary outreach that
became the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly based in Copenhagen. The
institutions created by the Paris Charter began the process of turning
the CSCE into the OSCE: from a Conference to an Organization with
executive functions, still dependent on a consensus of the participating
States to ratify its actions, but with rudimentary policy-making
capability. That capability grew exponentially in the early 1990s with
the establishment of many field presences, mostly in the new states,
often war-torn, that emerged from the ruins of the Soviet Union and
Yugoslavia. Each field presence possessed the latitude to pursue
programmes and policies to promote peace, security, democracy, the rule
of law and respect for human rights in places where all these were, when
the Charter was adopted, in very short supply.

The hard truth, however, is that regardless of the hopes and dreams of
many, democracy failed to survive in most of the former Soviet Union
outside the Baltics. In Central Asia, Communist Party first secretaries
remained in place, making a seamless transition to
presidencies-for-life. In the South Caucasus, democratically minded
nationalists only briefly replaced the party leaders. In 1992, warlords
overthrew Georgia's Zviad Gamsakhurdia and installed former Party first
secretary and Politburo member Eduard Shevardnadze as a figurehead
president. To gain real power, Shevardnadze allied with both old Party
figures and young democrats. In Azerbaijan, Abulfaz Elchibey and his
democratic allies in the Popular Front took power in 1992, upon which
Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan's Party boss turned president for life,
reportedly commented, "Such a man will survive one year".28 One year
later, Elchibey was indeed ousted in favour of former Party and KGB boss
and Politburo member Heydar Aliyev. Levon Ter-Petrosyan survived in
Armenia until 1998, when he was ousted by the even more nationalistic
Robert Kocharyan. In Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko won the first
presidential election in 1994 and then installed a Soviet-style
authoritarian regime. More democratic -- but extremely corrupt --
governments emerged in Ukraine and Moldova. Most significantly,
democracy failed in Russia, where Boris Yeltsin's initial promise was
drowned in corruption, organised crime and impoverishment. In all these
countries -- with only partial exceptions in Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia
and Armenia -- the very concept of democratic governance as an ideal was
discredited.

If we take as a proxy for democratic governance the peaceful transition
of power from one leader to an elected opponent without the intervention
of a revolution, coup or uprising, how many times has this happened in
the former Soviet Union (outside the Baltics)? Never in Central Asia,
where presidents have left only through revolution or death -- or, in
the case of Kazakhstan, retirement in favour of a personally designated
successor. Never in Russia, where Yeltsin designated his successor, who
has remained in power since, though nominally changing positions. Never
in Armenia or Azerbaijan, and in Georgia not until 2013, and never
since. The only states to experience multiple peaceful democratic
transitions of government were Ukraine (1994, 2010 and 2019) and Moldova
(1997, 2001, 2016 and 2020).

In place of democratic ideals, nascent autocrats nurtured an ideology of
grievance -- based on the real lawlessness and impoverishment of
immediate post-Soviet life -- that blamed early attempts at democracy
for abasing their countries. In Russia, the Putin narrative holds that
the early 1990s represented a period of misery, disgrace and weakness
that the West exploited to expand at Russia's expense, promoting Western
-- not universal -- "interpretations" of democracy and human rights as a
means of keeping Russia subjugated. This narrative has found widespread
acceptance both inside and outside Russia. It has given political cover
to other states adopting overtly authoritarian measures. They use it to
buttress an ideology asserting that Western "interpretations" of
democracy and human rights are a transplant that corrodes traditional
values, a club to bludgeon sovereign countries into weakness and
submission.29

The OSCE, in its efforts to promote democratic governance and respect
for human rights, never developed an effective strategy to counter this
narrative. ODIHR heads and other OSCE officials presented -- and
continue to present -- the issue in simple terms: participating States
had undertaken solemn commitments to universal ideals and needed to live
up to them. Civil society activists who flocked to ODIHR's Human
Dimension Implementation Meetings in Warsaw, Europe's largest annual
human rights conferences, believed the most effective way to get wayward
states to live up to these commitments was to "name and shame" those who
did not, unaware that figures such as Vladimir Putin could exploit
naming and shaming by the West to boost their domestic standing.

ODIHR election monitoring missions were sent out to "east of Vienna" and
"west of Vienna" countries with equal frequency -- ODIHR was sensitive
to criticism that it thought only "east of Vienna" was worth monitoring
-- but found far more to criticise in the east, especially in Azerbaijan
and Central Asia. From 1999 to 2020 ODIHR issued thirty statements and
reports expressing concern, criticism or condemnation of Azerbaijani
elections or human rights practices and thirty-five about Kazakhstan,
but only sixteen on Russia and eleven on Hungary (mostly about
Roma/Sinti issues). The RFoM similarly found much to criticise in
Azerbaijan: for the same period, the Representative issued seventy-four
statements of concern, criticism or condemnation on Azerbaijan (mostly
for high-profile prosecutions of journalists), but only thirty-eight
about Kazakhstan and seventeen about Hungary. On Russia the RFoM issued
few statements until Putin's return to the presidency in 2012 but has
issued ninety-four since then.

OSCE efforts to promote democratic governance and respect for human
rights in states unreceptive to that message has resembled, over the
last two decades, Sisyphus pushing the boulder uphill, with the slope
steepening after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Already hobbled
since the financial crisis of 2008 by a "zero nominal growth" budgetary
policy, the OSCE suffered from a structural disadvantage imposed by the
consensus principle: all decisions require unanimity, including annual
consent on the budgets and mandates of field presences. To be sure,
field presences had closed in the past: host countries joined the EU and
no longer needed the programmes or services provided by OSCE missions,
or the single purpose for which some presences were established became
obsolete (e.g., the Representative to the Estonian Expert Commission on
Military Pensioners). But in 2010 Belarus took a new step: it closed the
Office in Minsk, whose director was vociferous in raising democracy and
human rights issues. The crisis of 2014 emboldened those who resented
OSCE criticisms. In 2014 Azerbaijan downgraded the OSCE Office in Baku
to a Project Coordinator and closed it entirely the following year. In
2017 Armenia followed suit, closing the Office in Yerevan.

It was only a matter of time before participating States threatened
breaking consensus to promote other demands, and in 2020 Azerbaijan set
off the cycle that vacated the leadership positions in ODIHR, RFoM, HCNM
and the Secretariat. Now that participating States have seen what is
possible, it cannot be unseen and will be difficult to reverse. While it
will be the task of the 2021 Swedish Chair-inOffice (CiO) and her
successors to help re-establish the institutions to carry out their
tasks effectively, the threat of any participating State's breaking
consensus reminds the institutions of the cost of doing their jobs. In a
Zoom webinar with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on 28
January 2021, CiO Ann Linde, Foreign Minister of Sweden, reiterated --
in the same words as previous OSCE officials -- determination to press
for respect for human rights and democracy as commitments undertaken
without reservation by participating States. The drama continues.

Conclusion

[The OSCE has met with]{.underline} decidedly **[mixed
results]{.underline}** [over the last]{.underline} ten
[years]{.underline}. OSCE [mediators' best efforts were no more
successful than in the twenty preceding years. A mediator cannot make
peace if the **sides**]{.underline} -- or in some cases, their patrons
-- **[do not want it]{.underline}**. The Special Monitoring Mission in
Ukraine can be judged as a success in keeping the international
community informed and involved but the consensus principle and the lack
of a legal personality, which render the OSCE heavily dependent on its
participating States, make it impossible for the OSCE to go beyond the
bounds set by those states, especially when the latter are belligerents.
That limitation is even more severe in the case of promotion of
democratic governance and human rights. [Participating States can -- and
did --]{.underline} **[disrupt]{.underline}** all
**[activities]{.underline}** [in these areas. What do these cases tell
us about]{.underline} **[where]{.underline}** the **[OSCE is
heading?]{.underline}**

In 2016, [following Russia's annexation of]{.underline}
**[Crimea]{.underline}** [and the]{.underline} **[war in]{.underline}**
eastern [**Ukraine**, the OSCE established]{.underline} a **[Structured
Dialogue]{.underline}** to work on "challenges in the wider
politico-military sphere" [in areas on which East and West were still
capable of finding common ground]{.underline}.30 It followed an earlier
attempt at dialogue, the Corfu Process, created by the Greek CiO in 2009
in the wake of the Russian-Georgian War and Medvedev's proposal for a
new European security treaty.31 [The Structured Dialogue
**can**]{.underline} [be viewed as a]{.underline}
**[return]{.underline}** to the CSCE of 1975: [a]{.underline}
**[permanent conference of states]{.underline}**, most [affiliated
with]{.underline} **[rival]{.underline}** security, political and/or
economic [**blocs**, whose purpose was]{.underline} [**discussing issues
of European security and cooperation**. Given the continuing
difficulties the OSCE faces in carrying out]{.underline}
**[executive]{.underline}** [functions, the question participating
States must ask themselves becomes: "what future do we
**want**]{.underline} for the OSCE**[?]{.underline}**" If the answer is
a return to the 1975 CSCE, they need do nothing: the Structured Dialogue
is that future, barring only window dressing. [A]{.underline}
**[return]{.underline}** to 1975 [would]{.underline} still [leave the
OSCE a]{.underline} **[valuable organisation]{.underline}**, especially
since some participating States appear to look forward to a return of
blocs, spheres of influence and a more Westphalian and less multilateral
world.

[If, however, the participating States want an OSCE capable of carrying
out the **executive functions**]{.underline} [needed to]{.underline}
**[mediate peace]{.underline}**, mount effective observer missions and
promote the democratic and human rights commitments they undertook at
Helsinki in 1975 and Paris in 1990, [they must]{.underline} agree to
**[strengthen the OSCE's executive capabilities]{.underline}** and give
the organisation more autonomy from their own day-to-day pressure. They
can start this process in three ways: the first -- and admittedly most
difficult -- is to amend the process of achieving consensus in choosing
the leadership of OSCE institutions to negate direct threats from
participating States with a particular grievance -- the drama we saw in
2020. We can only hope that [the]{.underline} **[certainty of a
stalemated organisation]{.underline}** [-- in]{.underline} **[every
function]{.underline}** -- will serve to concentrate minds.

Secondly, participating States should agree on a legal personality for
the OSCE that will allow it to carry out basic day-to-day tasks that are
now barred -- as we saw, the SMM in Ukraine could not even open its own
bank account. In this regard the position of the United States will be
key, since it represented the original resistance to a legal personality
and a stronger executive. Historically, "Jacksonian"32 US legislators,
suspicious of internationalism, led that charge. After four years of
Jacksonian foreign policymaking by the Trump Administration, President
Joseph Biden and his team face an uphill battle in credibly asserting
that a return of US commitment to internationalism will outlast the new
Administration.33 One step in rebuilding credibility would be
strengthening the OSCE's executive capabilities -- furthering the twin
goals of re-engaging with multilateralism and re-engaging with Europe.

Lastly, states committed to democracy, the rule of law and respect for
human rights need to work together to come up with a better argument for
furthering those goals among all participating States. Merely doubling
down on insisting that these are universal ideals to which those states
undertook commitments has not proved effective in the past and is
unlikely to be effective in the future. [States now]{.underline}
**[undermine the OSCE]{.underline}** acquis not [by]{.underline}
**[challenging]{.underline}** democracy, legality or human rights per
se, but rather the meaning ascribed to them by Western powers. Calling
those **[ideals]{.underline}** aspects of geopolitical struggle, a
community of "**[illiberal]{.underline}**" **[states]{.underline}** [now
**claim**]{.underline}s [the right to **define them in Orwellian
oxymorons**]{.underline}. The democracies of Europe, still the majority,
are fragmented but also diverse -- which also means they have voices
that can bridge the divide.

ОБСЕ или Организация по безопасности и сотрудничеству в Европе --
довольно молодая организация по поддержке безопасности и стабильности
относительно своих коллег, таких как ООН, ЕС или НАТО, создана лишь в
1975 году. Создание Организации по безопасности и сотрудничеству в
Европе было направлено на закрепление 10 принципов хельсинкского
Заключительного акта Совещания по безопасности и сотрудничеству в
Европе: суверенного равенства, неприменения силы и ее угроз, нерушимости
границ, территориальной целостности государств, мирного урегулирования
споров, невмешательства во внутренние дела, уважение прав человека и
основных свобод, включая свободу мысли, совести, религии и убеждений,
равноправие и право народов располагать своей судьбой, сотрудничество
между государствами и добросовестное выполнение обязательств по
международному праву. И по сей день, со времен образования первых
организаций по обеспечению мирного порядка, таких, как Лига Наций,
главной целью мирового сообщества остается поддержание безопасности и
контроль за соблюдением прав человека.

В 1995 году ОБСЕ стала первой организацией, отвечающей за
общеевропейский порядок. Ее спектр действий направлен на предупреждение
кризисов и конфликтных ситуаций, их урегулирование и постконфликтная
реабилитация. Помимо решения вопросов экономики и экологии, укрепления
мира и безопасности в Европе, немаловажным аспектом деятельности ОБСЕ
является защита прав людей. Уважение прав человека и основных свобод
является ключевым элементом всеобъемлющей концепции безопасности ОБСЕ.
Во-первых, идет борьба с торговлей людьми. Действия ОБСЕ против торговли
людьми координируются Управлением Специального представителя и
координатора по борьбе с торговлей людьми. Во-вторых, идет обеспечение
гендерного равенства, свободы религии, слова, передвижения, СМИ.
В-третьих, ОБСЕ выявляет, ищет пути разрешения напряженности между
этническими представителями и устанавливает стандарты прав для групп
меньшинств. Создано Бюро по демократическим институтам и правам человека
(БДИПЧ), которое представляет собой институт по содействию обеспечению
прав человека, развитию демократии и утверждению верховенства закона.

Рассмотрим работу организации на примере Республики Кыргызстан. В летнее
время жители сел югозапада страны сталкиваются с проблемой нехватки
поливной воды. Здесь проживают представители различных этнических групп,
и ограниченный доступ к воде может привести к конфликтам. ОБСЕ
организовала курсы посредников для местного населения для того, чтобы
обученные «вестники мира» могли помочь разрешить разногласия в своих
общинах. Центр ОБСЕ в Бишкеке стремится к долгосрочному позитивному
воздействию на жизнь жителей Кыргызстана, работая в таких сферах, как
укрепление отношений между общинами, укрепление надлежащего управления,
содействие защите прав человека и верховенства закона, а также
продвижение гендерного равенства. Так, браки по договоренности все еще
реальны для многих молодых женщин Кыргызстана. Большое количество таких
браков распадаются, и часто женщина остается одна, затрудняясь
справиться со сложившейся ситуацией. ОБСЕ поддерживает местные
организации, в том числе сеть «Женских Инициативных Групп», которые
оказывают помощь и содействие женщинам, оказавшимся в подобной ситуации.

Все бы хорошо, но везде есть свои изъяны и недостатки. По нашему мнению,
деятельность ОБСЕ недостаточно эффективна. Начнем с того, что
организация не может принуждать государства к миру, так как это
прописано в Хельсинкском документе 1992 года. Она не является
доминирующей на фоне своих коллег, таких как ЕС и ООН. Ей отведена роль
«гуманитарного контролера», который действует в своих геостратегических
интересах, а не следует задаче восстановления мира в том или ином
регионе. Явным примером, на наш взгляд, является ситуация в Украине, где
велись ожесточенные бои в районах Донбасса, Краматорска, Донецка.
Насколько было известно из СМИ, представители ОБСЕ были в местах
напряженности, но это не привело к какому-либо немедленному разрешению
противоречий.

Можно долго рассуждать о проблемах деятельности ОБСЕ и, хотя при ее
гибкой, мобильной работе, она остается ограниченной в своих полномочиях,
что влияет на выполнение своих обязанностей, таких как обеспечение
миропорядка на территории Европы, ведь, повторимся, ОБСЕ не имеет права
силой принуждать страны к миру. По нашему мнению, организация нуждается
в реформах, так как нет ничего неизменного. Всему в этом мире нужно
развиваться.

[The]{.underline} **[[OSCE]{.underline}]{.mark}** or the Organization
for Security and Co--operation in Europe [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[fairly [young]{.mark}]{.underline}** organization to support security
and stability [relative to its counterparts]{.underline}, such as the
UN, EU or NATO, established only in 1975. The creation of the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe was aimed at
consolidating the 10 principles of the Helsinki Final Act of the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe: sovereign equality,
non-use of force and its threats, inviolability of borders, territorial
integrity of States, peaceful settlement of disputes, non-interference
in internal affairs, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms,
including freedom of thought, conscience, religion and beliefs, equality
and the right of peoples to have their own destiny, cooperation between
States and the faithful fulfillment of obligations under international
law. To this day, since the formation of the first organizations to
ensure a peaceful order, such as the League of Nations, the main goal of
the world community remains to maintain security and monitor the
observance of human rights.

In 1995, [the OSCE became the first organization responsible for the
**pan-European** order. Its range of actions is aimed at preventing
crises and conflict situations, their settlement and post-conflict
rehabilitation]{.underline}. In addition to addressing economic and
environmental issues, strengthening peace and security in Europe, [an
important aspect of the OSCE\'s activities is the protection of **human
rights**]{.underline}. Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
is a key element of the OSCE\'s comprehensive security concept. Firstly,
[there is a fight against **human trafficking**]{.underline}. OSCE
actions against human trafficking are coordinated by the Office of the
Special Representative and Coordinator for Combating Human Trafficking.
Secondly, **[gender]{.underline}** equality, [freedom of
**religion**]{.underline}, **[speech]{.underline}**,
**[movement]{.underline}**, [and the **media**]{.underline} [are being
ensured]{.underline}. Thirdly, [the OSCE identifies and seeks ways to
resolve tensions between **ethnic** representatives and sets standards
of rights for **minority groups**]{.underline}. The Office for
Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) has been established,
which is an institution for the promotion of human rights, the
development of democracy and the establishment of the rule of law.

Let\'s consider the work of the organization on the example of the
Republic of Kyrgyzstan. In the summer, residents of villages in the
south-west of the country face the problem of lack of irrigation water.
Representatives of various ethnic groups live here, and limited access
to water can lead to conflicts. The OSCE has organized mediation courses
for the local population so that trained \"messengers of peace\" can
help resolve differences in their communities. The OSCE Center in
Bishkek strives to have a long-term positive impact on the lives of
Kyrgyz residents by working in areas such as strengthening community
relations, strengthening good governance, promoting human rights and the
rule of law, and promoting gender equality. So, arranged marriages are
still real for many young women in Kyrgyzstan. A large number of such
marriages break up, and often a woman is left alone, finding it
difficult to cope with the current situation. The OSCE supports local
organizations, including a network of \"Women\'s Initiative Groups\"
that provide assistance and assistance to women who find themselves in a
similar situation.

Everything would be fine, but [[there are **flaws**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[shortcomings everywhere]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In
our opinion, [the OSCE\'s [activities are **not
effective**]{.mark}]{.underline} enough. Let\'s start with the fact that
[[the organization cannot **force**]{.underline}]{.mark} [states to
**[peace]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as it is prescribed in the Helsinki
Document of 1992. [It [is **not dominant**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[against]{.mark} the background of its **colleagues**]{.underline},
[such as [the **EU**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**[UN]{.underline}**. [It]{.underline}]{.mark} [is assigned the role of
a \"humanitarian **controller**\" who [acts in]{.mark} his
**[geostrategic interests]{.mark}**, and does [not]{.mark} follow the
task of [restoring **peace**]{.mark}]{.underline} in a particular
region. [[A clear example]{.underline}]{.mark}, in our opinion,
[[is]{.mark} the situation in **Ukraine**]{.underline}, where fierce
battles were fought [in]{.underline} [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} areas of
**[[Donbass]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Kramatorsk, Donetsk. As far as it
was known from the media, [[OSCE]{.mark} representatives
[were]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[in places of tension]{.underline}**, [but
this did not **lead to**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[any immediate
[resolution]{.mark} of the contradictions]{.underline}**.

One can talk for a long time about the problems of [the OSCE\'s
[activities]{.mark}]{.underline} and,
[al**[though]{.mark}**]{.underline} with its
**[[flexible]{.underline}]{.mark}**, mobile work, it
**[[remain]{.underline}]{.mark}**s [**[limited]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [its **[power]{.mark}**s]{.underline}, [which
affects the performance of its duties, such as ensuring world
order]{.underline} in Europe, because, again, [the OSCE has no right to
**force** countries to **peace**]{.underline}. In our opinion, the
organization needs reforms, since nothing is unchangeable. Everything in
this world needs to evolve.

#### OSCE is wrecked

Daniel **Trachsler 12**, analyst at CCS Analysis in Security Policy,
"The OSCE: Fighting for Renewed Relevance," CCS Analysis, No. 110, March
2012, https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/141518/CSS-Analysis-110-EN.pdf

Loss of relevance

For about ten years now, the [OSCE has been **struggling**]{.underline}
[against]{.underline} a **[loss of relevance]{.underline}**. This
challenge stems [from a **number** of reasons]{.underline}: firstly,
[competition from **other actors**]{.underline}; secondly,
**[paralysis]{.underline}** of the organisation [due to an **East-West
split**]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} thirdly, [its]{.underline}
**[diffuse profile]{.underline}** and low degree of visibility. Europe's
security architecture has changed, and the [OSCE has become **less
attractive**]{.underline} as a consequence. The expansion drives of
**[NATO]{.underline}** and the EU [were]{.underline} **[crucial
factors]{.underline}**. Numerous countries joined these two
organisations, which had more to offer their members than the OSCE did:
concrete security guarantees as well as economic and financial prowess.
NATO and the EU also introduced frameworks of association apart from
full membership, reducing the importance of the OSCE's encompassing
nature.

The OSCE also faced competition in its areas of activity. With the
establishment of a common security and defence policy, the EU became
active in areas that had previously been regarded as core competencies
of the OSCE, e.g., election monitoring, conflict mediation and field
missions (e.g. EUPM in Bosnia-Herzegovina, EUMM in Georgia after the
2008 war). This led to a duplication of competencies on unequal terms,
as Brussels has vastly greater resources. There is also an overlap
between the OSCE and the Council of Europe, particularly in the human
dimension of security (e.g., promotion of human rights and democracy).
Vienna and Strasbourg have established co-ordination mechanisms. A
clearer division of labour exists with NATO, which as a defence alliance
guarantees the military security of its members. The UN, in turn, has
recognised the OSCE as a regional organisation, while the OSCE itself
regards support for the UN, e.g. in the area of conflict prevention, as
one of its tasks. Here, too, co-operation and division of labour are
crucial. There is no argument over jurisdiction when it comes to
authorising sanctions and coercive measures, which is done under the
aegis of the UN Security Council.

The renewed East-West divide within the OSCE is also problematic, since
it weakens the organisation's ability to act. **[NATO]{.underline}**/ EU
[countries stand in **opposition** to **Russia**]{.underline} and other
likeminded states, [in the context of the generally tense political
relations between Moscow and Washington, in particular with regard to
the Eastern **expansion of NATO**]{.underline} and the US development of
a missile defence shield. OSCE-specific factors are also important,
specifically the erosion of the normative consensus among member states
and the crisis of confidence this has entailed. With the end of the Cold
War, the OSCE's human dimension gained in importance. In Copenhagen
(1990) and Moscow (1991), member states agreed that obligations relating
to the human dimension (human rights, democratisation, good governance)
could not be considered as exclusively domestic affairs. The
introduction of relevant instruments ("Moscow mechanism") implied a
curtailment of the sovereignty principle.

This development is meeting with increasing resistance from Moscow. The
dominant view in Russia is that the co-operative strategy of the 1990s
has failed. Western states, it is believed, have ignored Russian
security interests, e.g., with regard to missile defence and the CFE
treaty, and there is a widespread perception that the West has not
respected Moscow's sphere of interests, as evinced by its support of the
"colour revolutions" in Central Europe. Russia makes three accusations
in particular: First, that the human dimension within the OSCE is
overemphasised at the expense of the political/military dimension.
Secondly, that the OSCE resolves the tension between state sovereignty
(territorial integrity, non-intervention, inviolable borders) and
fundamental rights of the people (human rights, self-determination) in a
lopsided manner favouring the latter (e.g., when recognising the
independence of Kosovo). And thirdly, that the geographic equilibrium of
the OSCE's activities has been lost. The OSCE, according to this view,
essentially only intervenes 'east of Vienna', although relevant issues
also exist further West (e.g., Basque country, Northern Ireland). This
criticism culminated in 2007, when Russian President Vladimir Putin
accused the OSCE of having degenerated into a vulgar instrument of
asserting Western interests.

[Due to the **consensus**]{.underline} [rule, the split]{.underline}
between East and West **[paralyses]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
**[organisation]{.underline}**. [Member states **failed to pass a joint
action plan**]{.underline} at the Astana summit [and did not agree on
**final statements**]{.underline} [at]{.underline}
**[several]{.underline}** ministerial **[meetings]{.underline}**. The
**[budget]{.underline}** [was]{.underline} also [the subject of frequent
dispute. The rift has led to **key**]{.underline} OSCE
**[missions]{.underline}** [not being]{.underline}
**[extended]{.underline}** [or their]{.underline}
**[mandates]{.underline}** [being watered down]{.underline} (e.g.,
Georgia, Belarus, Uzbekistan). Similarly, [Moscow tried to
strengthen]{.underline} [political **control**]{.underline}
[over]{.underline} the relatively independent [OSCE
institutions]{.underline} (ODHIR, HCNM, RFM). [The]{.underline} current
**[logjam]{.underline}** has also [impeded]{.underline} any
[clarification of]{.underline} the OSCE's **[legal status]{.underline}**
and the passing of an OSCE convention. The Western states suspect that
[Russia would use this as an opportunity to]{.underline} **[weaken the
organisation]{.underline}**'s competencies and limit the autonomy of its
institutions.

[The OSCE's]{.underline} **[low]{.underline}** degree of
**[visibility]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[also not
helpful]{.underline}** [to its reputation]{.underline}. Usually, [the
organisation only enjoys media coverage during]{.underline}
**[election-monitoring]{.underline}** campaigns [and]{.underline}
**[summit meetings]{.underline}**. Aside from that, [it]{.underline}
**[rarely]{.underline}** [creates]{.underline} [**positive headlines**.
Its]{.underline} most important **[successes]{.underline}** (such as the
missions in Kosovo, Croatia, and Bosnia) [are a]{.underline} [**thing of
the past**. In Europe's]{.underline} **["frozen
conflicts",]{.underline}** e.g., [in Transdniestr or Nagorno Karabakh,
where the OSCE has long been active, progress is a]{.underline} [**long
way off**. The]{.underline} **[hard day-to-day work]{.underline}** that
[the OSCE performs]{.underline} competently in many places (e.g.,
Kyrgyzstan mission, activities of ODIHR and HCNM) often
[goes]{.underline} **[unnoticed]{.underline}** by the public.
**[Success]{.underline}** in conflict prevention [is]{.underline}
**[notoriously difficult]{.underline}** to demonstrate. As a result,
public awareness of the OSCE's relevance is limited at best.

[This effect is]{.underline} **[further]{.underline}** [intensified by
the OSCE's]{.underline} **[diffuse profile]{.underline}**. After
1989/91, its activities grew organically rather than in a strategically
controlled manner. This resulted in the currently almost excessively
broad range of activities, from conflict prevention, over the fight
against terrorism, and human trafficking to the promotion of media
freedom and trade. Extending OSCE activities into the domains of energy
security and cybersecurity is also being discussed. Added to this is the
lack of continuity arising from the rotating chairmanship and the
limited strategic planning competencies of the OSCE secretariat. While
cross-dimensional activities are part and parcel of the OSCE, they also
carry the risk of dissipating energy in the absence of clear thematic
focus.

### OSCE CP\-\--NATO Key\-\--Norms

#### NATO is key\-\--they possess unique intellectual and political capital to propagate best practices. 

Dr Ulf **Ehlert 21**, head of Strategy and Policy in the Office of the
Chief Scientist at NATO headquarters, "Why Our Values Should Drive Our
Technology Choices," NATO Review, 12-16-2021,
https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2021/12/16/why-our-values-should-drive-our-technology-choices/index.html

Setting norms -- a role for NATO?

Emerging and Disruptive Technologies (EDTs) came into NATO's political
focus in 2019, when NATO leaders adopted an implementation roadmap for
seven such technologies. Regardless of their tremendous promise, we must
realise that these technologies are not yet mature, not yet "fully out
there". Therefore, considerable uncertainty remains to which extent
these fledgling technologies and their foreseeable applications are
appropriately contained within established legal, ethical, and moral
norms. These questions are not limited to military applications, nor do
they stop at national borders: rather, they cut across many government
departments and business sectors, and they affect humanity in its
entirety.

In this complex, fast moving, high-stake setting, we must view
technology and values as intertwined. While our values should guide our
use of technology, we must recognise that our technology choices will,
whether intended or not, reflect the values we adhere to.

[As inaction is not an option, we must take active measures to
**establish norms**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the
[future]{.underline} use of [technologies; norms that are deeply rooted
in our **values**]{.underline}; [technologies that are currently
emerging and have recognised disruption potential (such as]{.underline}
**[AI]{.underline}**, biotechnology, and quantum technology). [How could
we realistically master this novel challenge? The following three
proposals could pave the way]{.underline}.

> We must effectively cope with the uncertainties of technology
> evolution. Hence, I suggest evolutionary policy-making, building on
> current knowledge, but flexible enough so that today's decisions can
> be adjusted or corrected in the future.
>
> We must strive to limit potential harm without unduly constraining the
> benefits a technology can bring. Therefore, our policies should set
> limits for the application of technologies (such as genetically
> optimised super-soldiers) rather than banning entire technology areas
> (in this case, biotechnology).
>
> [We need to **understand when policy changes are
> necessary**]{.underline} and what those changes should be. [Reflecting
> the diversity of interests, we need to institutionalise a broad
> **stakeholder engagement**]{.underline} that reaches out to all
> parties affected by a technology and influencing its evolution.

Within this broadly applicable framing, **[NATO's role is
specific]{.underline}**. [As the international organisation committed to
**defence and security in the North Atlantic**]{.underline} area, [it
convenes **considerable political, military, economic, and technological
power**]{.underline}. [Building in **particular** on its **political**
and **intellectual capital**]{.underline}, [the Alliance can **credibly
spearhead norm setting for technology applications in defence to comply
with Western values.**]{.underline}

[With its recently published AI Strategy, NATO fulfils its traditional
role in an innovative way. This Strategy embraces **principles** of
responsible use, which express the **value-driven norms that
NATO**]{.underline} and its member **[nations will adhere
to]{.underline}** in the application of AI. [By making these principles
public, they **set an example**]{.underline} for other nations to
consider and potentially adopt NATO's principles. This is an effective
approach towards proposing and gradually implementing an international
norm, not unlike the European Union's General Data Protection
Regulation.

#### NATO's direct integration into military issues makes it uniquely effective at ensuring compliance with international law.

International legal norms

In certain respects, the legal debate mirrors much of the ethical debate
surrounding AI as the two address many of the same issues. International
law is a values-based system embedded in certain principles and
practices agreed-upon within the international system. This section
certainly identifies the complementarity of the ethical discussion
surrounding AI, but it also illustrates where the legal debate can
depart from the ethical considerations to address different sorts of
legal challenges that face the Alliance.

[Lawyers]{.underline}, researchers, and civil society [grapple
with]{.underline} existing [legal regimes relevant to military
operations and the uncertainty and ambiguity surrounding automated
decision-making, particularly in lethal decision-making. Thus far,
the]{.underline} legal [dialogue has been]{.underline} heavily [anchored
in]{.underline} the applicability of international humanitarian law
([IHL]{.underline}), and other relevant legal regimes, to lethal
autonomous weapons systems.72 IHL, also known as the laws of war or the
laws of armed conflict, regulate the means and methods of warfare and,
as such, is pivotal to the emergence of military technology and how
existing legal structures are disrupted. [The legal debate]{.underline}
often [revolves around the prospect of a "treaty **ban**" of
LAWS]{.underline}.73

[But the]{.underline} legal [debate is **much more
nuanced**]{.underline} [than the likelihood of]{.underline}
international **[treaties]{.underline}** **[banning]{.underline}** [any
particular weapon system]{.underline}. Especially [because **NATO**
is]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** a **[regulatory]{.underline}**
body, [it]{.underline} **[cannot institute measures to regulate emerging
technology for the Allies]{.underline}**. [Instead, NATO's function in
the legal domain may be **more** effective **outside** the
**traditional**]{.underline} [legal debates around emerging military
technology and more embedded in **fostering cooperation and coordination
among military partners**]{.underline}.

[Other avenues of legal regulation may fall short of an international
convention or prohibition, but nevertheless factor
significantly]{.underline} in regulating and/or delineating state
policies. Additionally, non-lethal applications of AI, as well as
applications of AI that do not figure into autonomous systems, also
raise important legal questions under international law. Arguably, norms
around non-lethal applications are more urgent as their development is
more advanced, harder to define, and less controversial in
integration.74 [Ultimately, NATO's]{.underline} **[facilitative
power]{.underline}** [can help ensure that **integration of EDTs like
AI**]{.underline} [into]{.underline} **[military
capabilities]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} into **[multinational
coalition operations]{.underline}** [is **consistent**]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} member [states' **legal obligations**.]{.underline}

### OSCE CP\-\--Perm Do Both

#### The [perm]{.underline} is best\-\--NATO and the OSCE are [complimentary]{.underline}\-\--[combining]{.underline} dialogue [best]{.underline} propagates new security norms

Anton Sergeevich **Gavrilov 18**, Антон Сергеевич Гаврилов, researcher
at Mariisk State University, "Международные организации как механизмы
регулирования международных отношений (ООН, ОБСЕ, НАТО)," or
"International Organizations as Mechanisms for Regulating International
Relations (UN, OSCE, NATO)," Марийский государственный университет,
2018, pp. 490--492, translated by Yandex

На сегодняшний день систему международных отношений невозможно
представить без таких организаций, как ООН и ОБСЕ. Современный мир все
больше сталкивается с проблемами вооруженных столкновений, с самого
разного типа кризисными ситуациями. И лучший ключ к разрешению подобных
проблем --- деятельность данных организаций. Нельзя недооценивать всю
значимость миротворческих операций, проводимых ООН, невозможно выразить
всю благодарность деятельности ОБСЕ за проводимые ей планы по
урегулированию кризисных ситуаций, возникших в том или ином регионе. Это
лишь немногие плюсы данных международных организаций. Подводя итог в
данном вопросе, стоит сказать, что значимость ООН и ОБСЕ огромна.
Военнополитический блок НАТО, несмотря на свои сомнительные и далекие от
доверия средства решения возникших проблем, также представляет собой
важного игрока на международной арене и оказывает существенное влияние
на нее. НАТО так же, как ООН и ОБСЕ, способствует эффективному
предотвращению конфликтов и активно участвует в кризисном регулировании.

Помимо собственных целей, которые ставят перед собой данные
международные организации, они также следуют и целям коллективного
характера. Ярким примером взаимодействия двух игроков международной
арены в рамках коллективного целеполагания является взаимодействие НАТО
и ООН.

Вопросы, касаемые кризисного регулирования, объединяют НАТО и ООН.
Уместно будет сказать о правовой основе решения подобных вопросов. Глава
18 Устава ООН и Вашингтонский договор 1949 года подтверждают
приверженность Североатлантического союза основным принципам ООН. НАТО и
ИСАФ (Международные силы поддержания безопасности) тесно сотрудничают с
Миссией ООН по содействию Афганистану, а также и с другими
международными структурами, которые поддерживают работу по
государственному восстановлению, развитию и управлению. Стоит сказать,
что тесное взаимодействие ООН и НАТО проходит в самых различных форматах
как в Афганистане, так и в столицах стран ООН и НАТО. Сюда можно
добавить, что это, прежде всего, совместное членство в Объединенном
совете по координации и мониторингу, осуществляющем надзор за
соблюдением Афганского договора. Однако, несмотря на все вышеуказанные
положительные моменты данного сотрудничества, все же стоит сказать, что,
хотя НАТО и ООН сегодня весьма крупно развивают взаимодействие по
сложным вопросам осуществления безопасности, их отношения нельзя назвать
достаточно крепкими в плане партнерства.

Еще одним примером коллективного взаимодействия является сотрудничество
ООН и ОБСЕ. Здесь важно отметить, что ОБСЕ ведет активный диалог с ООН и
поддерживает с данной международной организацией весьма крепкие
партнерские отношения. ООН и ОБСЕ довольно упорно и слаженно
сотрудничают в сфере раннего обнаружения, своевременного отслеживания и
предотвращения конфликтов и кризисов. Обе международные организации в
своей работе делают упор исключительно на политико-дипломатические и
правовые средства решения возникших проблем в соответствии с уставом
ООН. Как в ОБСЕ, так и в ООН имеется широкий арсенал средств и
механизмом раннего предупреждения конфликтов и недопущения их
перерастания в военные конфликты.

Также стоит сказать, что все вышеперечисленные международные организации
сотрудничают совместно. ОБСЕ и ООН косвенно поддерживают отношения с
НАТО. Однако здесь речь может идти лишь о путях координации усилий НАТО
с деятельностью ООН и ОБСЕ. Рассуждая о дальнейшем сотрудничестве НАТО с
ООН и ОБСЕ, стоит отметить, что у НАТО практически отсутствуют
инструменты решения проблем, которые можно было бы использовать в сфере
превентивной дипломатии. Из этого следует вывод, что было бы довольно
положительно для НАТО чаще прибегать к встречам с Генеральным секретарем
ООН и ОБСЕ, обмениваться информацией, а также привлекать специальных и
личных представителей Генсекретаря ООН, действующего председателя ОБСЕ,
посредников и специалистов в области превентивной дипломатии.

Однако все же, говоря о взаимодействии данных игроков международной
арены, нельзя не сказать об истории их возникновения.

Хочется начать с Организации Объединенных Наций. Данная международная
организация была основана 24 октября 1945 года, именно к этому дню Устав
ратифицировали: Китай, Советский Союз, Великобритания, Соединенные
Штаты, Франция, а также большое количество других подписавших его
государств. Главной своей целью ООН ставит поддержание мира между
странами и народами, предупреждение возможных конфликтов и улаживание
споров дипломатическими средствами.

Говоря об Организации по безопасности и сотрудничеству в Европе, стоит
сказать, что создание этой международной организации приходится на 1975
год. Итоговый акт был подписан в конце июля -- начале августа 1975 года
в столице Финляндии, Хельсинках. С того времени Совет по безопасности и
сотрудничеству в Европе стал проводить свои встречи регулярно. Данная
организация ориентирует свое внимание на таких вопросах, как
предотвращение возникновения конфликтов в регионе, урегулирование
кризисных ситуаций, ликвидация последствий конфликтов.

Закончим данный краткий исторический экскурс информацией об истории
создания и целях военнополитического блока НАТО.

НАТО была создана 4 апреля 1949 года в городе Вашингтон. Стоит сказать,
что с самого начала НАТО была нацелена и ориентирована на полное
противодействие Советскому Союзу, а также и странам --- участницам
Организации Варшавского договора позднее. Сама стратегическая концепция
определяет многие первостепенные задачи НАТО. Выделим несколько:
выступает основой стабильности в Евроатлантическом регионе; служит
форумом для проведения консультаций по проблемам безопасности;
способствует эффективному предотвращению конфликтов и активно участвует
в кризисном регулировании и т. д. В своей деятельности НАТО опирается на
особые программы сотрудничества. Одной из таких является программа
«Партнерство ради мира». Данная программа представляет собой форму
двустороннего практического сотрудничества, особенно в военной сфере,
между НАТО и отдельными странами-партнерами.

Подводя итог рассуждениям по данному вопросу, надо сказать, что
деятельность всех вышеперечисленных международных организаций оказывает
большое влияние на систему международных отношений. Действительно, это
своего рода механизмы работы великой машины, имя которой ---
международные отношения, и каждый механизм важен для продуктивного и
правильного функционирования этого уникального средства для поддержания
дипломатии, диалога и сотрудничества.

Today, it is impossible to imagine the system of international relations
without such organizations as the UN and the OSCE. [The modern world is
increasingly faced with]{.underline} the [problems of]{.underline}
[**armed clashes**, with]{.underline} **[various]{.underline}** types of
**[crisis situations]{.underline}**. And [the]{.underline} best
**[key]{.underline}** [to **solving**]{.underline} [such problems
is]{.underline} the activities of [**these organizations**. It
is]{.underline} **[impossible to underestimate]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} **[importance]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} UN
peacekeeping operations, it is impossible to express all gratitude to
the **[OSCE]{.underline}** for its **[plans]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[resolve crisis situations]{.underline}** that have
arisen in a particular region. These are just a few advantages of these
international organizations. Summing up on this issue, it is worth
saying that the importance of the UN and the OSCE is enormous. The NATO
military-political bloc, despite its dubious and far from trustworthy
means of solving the problems that have arisen, also represents an
important player in the international arena and has a significant impact
on it. NATO, as well as the UN and OSCE, contributes to effective
conflict prevention and actively participates in crisis management.

In addition to their own goals set by these international organizations,
they also follow collective goals. A striking example of the interaction
of two players in the international arena within the framework of
collective goal-setting is the interaction of NATO and the UN.

Issues related to crisis management unite NATO and the UN. It would be
appropriate to say about the legal basis for solving such issues.
Chapter 18 of the UN Charter and the Washington Treaty of 1949 confirm
the Alliance\'s commitment to the basic principles of the UN. NATO and
ISAF (International Security Support Force) work closely with the UN
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, as well as with other international
structures that support the work on state reconstruction, development
and governance. It is worth saying that close cooperation between the UN
and NATO takes place in a variety of formats both in Afghanistan and in
the capitals of the UN and NATO countries. It can be added here that
this is, first of all, joint membership in the Joint Coordination and
Monitoring Council, which oversees compliance with the Afghan Treaty.
However, despite all the above-mentioned positive aspects of this
cooperation, it is still worth saying that, although NATO and the UN are
developing cooperation on complex security issues on a very large scale
today, their relations cannot be called strong enough in terms of
partnership.

Another example of collective cooperation is the cooperation of the UN
and the OSCE. It is important to note here that [the OSCE
conducts]{.underline} an **[active dialogue]{.underline}** [with the UN
and maintains very strong **partnership**]{.underline} [relations with
this]{.underline} **[i]{.underline}**nternational
**[o]{.underline}**rganization. [The UN and]{.underline} the [OSCE are
cooperating]{.underline} quite hard and **[harmoniously]{.underline}**
[in the field of early]{.underline} detection, timely
**[tracking]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[prevention]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[conflicts and
crises]{.underline}**. Both international organizations in their work
focus exclusively on political, diplomatic and legal means of solving
the problems that have arisen in accordance with the UN Charter. Both
the OSCE and the UN have a wide arsenal of tools and a mechanism for
early warning of conflicts and preventing them from escalating into
military conflicts.

It is also worth saying that all of the above international
organizations cooperate together. The OSCE and the UN indirectly
maintain relations with NATO. However, here we can only talk about ways
to coordinate NATO\'s efforts with the activities of the UN and the
OSCE. [Speaking about]{.underline} **[NATO\'s]{.underline}** further
[cooperation with the]{.underline} UN and the [**OSCE**, it
is]{.underline} [worth noting that NATO has]{.underline} practically
**[no problem-solving tools]{.underline}** [that could be used in the
field of]{.underline} [**preventive diplomacy**. It follows from this
that it would be quite]{.underline} **[positive]{.underline}** [for NATO
to]{.underline} resort **[more often]{.underline}** to
**[meet]{.underline}**ings [with the]{.underline} UN Secretary General
and the [**OSCE**, to]{.underline} **[exchange
information]{.underline}**, as well as to involve special and personal
representatives of the UN Secretary General, the OSCE
Chairman-in-Office, mediators and specialists in the field of preventive
diplomacy.

However, speaking about the interaction of these players in the
international arena, it is impossible not to say about the history of
their origin.

I would like to start with the United Nations. This international
organization was founded on October 24, 1945, it was on this day that
the Charter was ratified by: China, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, the
United States, France, as well as a large number of other signatory
states. The main goal of the UN is to maintain peace between countries
and peoples, prevent possible conflicts and settle disputes by
diplomatic means.

Speaking about the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe,
it is worth saying that the creation of this international organization
falls in 1975. The final act was signed in late July -- early August
1975 in the capital of Finland, Helsinki. Since that time, the Council
for Security and Cooperation in Europe has been holding its meetings
regularly. This organization focuses its attention on such issues as the
prevention of conflicts in the region, the settlement of crisis
situations, the elimination of the consequences of conflicts.

Let\'s finish this brief historical digression with information about
the history of the creation and goals of the NATO military-political
bloc.

NATO was established on April 4, 1949 in Washington. It is worth saying
that from the very beginning, NATO was aimed and focused on complete
opposition to the Soviet Union, as well as to the member countries of
the Warsaw Pact Organization later. The strategic concept itself defines
many of NATO\'s primary tasks. We will single out several: acts as the
basis of stability in the Euro-Atlantic region; serves as a forum for
consultations on security issues; promotes effective conflict prevention
and actively participates in crisis management, etc. [In its activities,
NATO relies on]{.underline} **[special cooperation
programs]{.underline}**. One of these is the Partnership for Peace
program. This program [is a form of]{.underline} **[bilateral practical
cooperation]{.underline}**, especially [in the]{.underline} **[military
sphere]{.underline}**, [between]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[individual partner countries]{.underline}**.

Summing up the reasoning on this issue, I must say that the activities
of all the above-mentioned international organizations have a great
influence on the system of international relations. Indeed, these are
some kind of mechanisms of the great machine, whose name is
international relations, and **[each mechanism]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} **[important]{.underline}** [for the productive and
proper functioning of this unique means for maintaining diplomacy,
dialogue and cooperation]{.underline}.

### OSCE CP\-\--Perm Russia in NATO

#### Only [offering Russia integration]{.underline}\-\--[even]{.underline} if it [refuses]{.underline}\-\--[communicates]{.underline} NATO's benign intent\-\--[integration]{.underline} solves [broad security coop]{.underline}

Relations, "NATO\'s Final Frontier: Why Russia Should Join the Atlantic
Alliance," Foreign Affairs, May/June 2010,

Nonetheless, [the West is making a **historic mistake**]{.underline} [in
treating Russia as a **strategic pariah**. As made]{.underline}
**[clear]{.underline}** [by the **settlements** after the **Napoleonic
Wars and World War II**]{.underline} \-- in contrast to the one that
followed World War I \-- **[including]{.underline}** [former adversaries
in a postwar order is **critical** to the **consolidation of great-power
peace**. **Anchoring** Russia in an enlarged Euro-Atlantic order,
therefore, should be an **urgent priority for NATO today**.]{.underline}

[[Russia has been disgruntled with]{.mark} the
**[expansion]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of NATO]{.mark} ever since the
alliance began **courting new members**]{.underline} from the former
Soviet bloc in the early 1990s. [However, Russia\'s economic and
military decline and the West\'s primacy encouraged NATO members to
discount the potential **consequences**]{.underline} [of Russian
discontent. \"As **American** capabilities **surged**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[Russian]{.underline}** [capabilities
**waned**]{.underline},\" the political scientists Daniel Deudney and G.
John Ikenberry have observed, \"[Washington policymakers increasingly
**acted** as though Russia **no longer mattered** and the United States
could **do whatever it wanted**]{.underline}.\"

[The]{.underline} **[strategic landscape]{.underline}** [has since
**changed dramatically**, however, and [the costs of **excluding**
Russia]{.mark} from the Euro-Atlantic order [have **risen**]{.mark}
**substantially**]{.underline}. The Kremlin\'s recentralization of power
and Russia\'s economic rebound thanks to higher energy prices have
brought the country back to life. [[Russia now has]{.mark} the
[confidence]{.mark} and the capability [to **push back** against NATO
\-- just as the West urgently needs Moscow\'s **coop**]{.mark}eration on
a **host of issues**]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} the
containment of **[Iran]{.underline}**\'s nuclear
ambitions**[,]{.underline}** **[arms control]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} non**[prolif]{.underline}**eration, the stabilization
of **[Afghanistan]{.underline}**, counter**[terror]{.underline}**ism,
[and]{.underline} **[energy]{.underline}** security.

Moreover, [the [ongoing **expansion**]{.mark} of NATO [has made]{.mark}
the question of [Russia\'s place]{.mark} in the Euro-Atlantic order even
[more **pressing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In its new military doctrine,
released this February, [Russia **identified NATO
enlargement**]{.underline} [as a **primary external threat**. The
alliance has been contemplating membership for Georgia and Ukraine, a
move that would dangerously **escalate tensions**]{.underline} between
NATO and Russia. Indeed, the Russian-Georgian war of 2008 was to some
extent a reflection of Moscow\'s disquiet about Georgia\'s westward
geopolitical alignment. And rather than just opposing NATO enlargement,
Russia is now offering its own ideas for revamping the Euro-Atlantic
security architecture. In November 2009, the Russian government released
a draft of a new European security treaty that laid out Moscow\'s
proposals for a pan-European institution. [NATO allies]{.underline}, it
seems, [no longer have the luxury of **indefinitely postponing**
consideration of Russia\'s place in the post-Cold War
settlement]{.underline}.

[[A vision for]{.mark} bringing [Russia into the Euro-Atlantic]{.mark}
space [is]{.mark} readily [within reach: **Russia should become a member
of NATO**.]{.mark} The country\'s eventual admission to the alliance
would be the logical **completion** of a Euro-Atlantic order in which
NATO is the primary security institution]{.underline}. Having embarked
on the process of enlarging NATO when the Soviet bloc collapsed, [the
Western allies should now do their best to conclude that process by
integrating Russia and other members of the]{.underline} Commonwealth of
Independent States ([CIS]{.underline}) [into the alliance.]{.underline}

[There are, of course, many other options for pursuing a pan-European
order]{.underline}, such as fashioning a treaty between NATO and the
Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization; elevating the
authority of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), of which Russia is a member; or picking up on Russia\'s proposal
for a new European security treaty. [But now that NATO]{.underline}, the
world\'s most powerful military alliance, [has 28 members and more to
come, these [**other** options are]{.mark} **merely [strategic
sideshows]{.mark}**[. Countries will be **either NATO**]{.mark}
**members** [or **outsiders**. The only **logical** path]{.mark} to a
**pan-European** order thus [entails Russia\'s **integration**]{.mark}
**into the alliance**.]{.underline}

Russia may ultimately reject inclusion in NATO due to the requirements
and constraints membership entails, instead choosing to go its own way.
[But if the primary institutions of the Euro-Atlantic community
ultimately fail to extend their reach to Russia, let it be due to the
**Kremlin\'s** missteps, **not** because the **Atlantic
democracies**]{.underline} [failed to demonstrate the
**vision**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} the **[will]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[embrace Russia]{.underline}** in a pan-European
order.

#### It\'s a [more sustainable solution]{.underline} to tensions with Russia than [stopping]{.underline} NATO expansion.

Third, [[Russia\'s integration]{.mark} into NATO would **[enable Georgia
and Ukraine to join]{.mark} the alliance [without]{.mark} provoking [a
crisis with Moscow]{.mark}**[. According to]{.mark} the
**[Russia]{.mark}**n political scientists]{.underline} Sergei Karaganov
and Timofei Bordachev, [the [admission]{.mark} of these countries into
NATO would **[increase]{.mark}** \"the risk of a
**[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} with unforeseeable consequences.\"
**[[Stopping]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the [enlargement]{.mark} of NATO
[**could** **avert this**]{.mark} **problem**]{.underline}
**[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** [would]{.underline} **[leave
another]{.underline}** one [**unsolved**: [How can
**Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and its **neighbors**]{.underline}
[[be]{.underline} **[integrated into a]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[unitary
[Euro-Atlantic order?]{.mark}]{.underline}** As Andrew Monaghan of the
NATO Defense College notes, \"[[Even if **enlargement
stops**]{.underline}, [Russia]{.underline} **[remains
excluded]{.underline}**]{.mark} [from Euro-Atlantic
mechanisms]{.underline}.\"

[[The]{.underline} **[solution]{.underline}**]{.mark}, then, [[is for
Georgia and Ukraine to **join** a]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}**
[in which **Russia is already**]{.underline}]{.mark}[**, or is soon to
be, [a member]{.mark}**[, ensuring]{.mark} that [their entry would cause
**little, if any**]{.mark}**, geopolitical
[tension]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More generally, [[if]{.mark} membership
in [the **CIS** remains **separate**]{.mark} from membership in NATO,
Europe\'s [East and West will be]{.mark} [subject to
**indefinite**]{.mark} **geopolitical [division]{.mark} and
jockeying**]{.underline} [over]{.underline} [**zones of influence**. In
contrast, [if NATO **opens its doors**]{.mark} to members of the CIS,
such dividing lines and the **[competition]{.mark}** that accompanies
them [will]{.mark} likely **[fade away]{.mark}**. There is a
**precedent**]{.underline} for this evolution: **[all]{.underline}** [of
the CIS members **already** **cooperate** with NATO through the
Partnership for Peace program and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council.]{.underline}
