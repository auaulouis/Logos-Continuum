#### NATO's "Smart Defense" policy for cybersecurity creates policy resilience to hybrid threats\-\--solves the case while preserving e-innovation

Security and Strategic Affairs on NATO issues and NATO-Russia relations,

Resilience as methodology: NATO's strategic aim

[**Resilience** is a method]{.underline}. A dedication to the goal. It
is therefore an aim. Terminologically is announced in security-led
strategies yet also business-led strategies. It holds a completely sound
operational aim. To deliver and stick to the requested. [It is brand
name that defines strategy through which it results to operational
capacity that sustains and grows; [at]{.mark} the level of
[NATO]{.mark}, with the capacity to apply in diverse fields of
operations adding value, to [an **already robust** **policy
decision**]{.mark} and operational **[capacity]{.mark}** building and
actions; at the level [of **cyber-security policy**
]{.mark}]{.underline}

[**[resilience]{.mark}** to the framework [is a "strong-hold" policy to
deliver]{.mark} a **[protection]{.mark}** mechanism and
method.]{.underline}

[Resilience's framework acknowledges the will for **preparedness** so as
to counter]{.underline} a possible integrative part of possible
[emerging crises]{.underline}. It is seen as [an innovative strategic
management policy procedure and tool.]{.underline} Strategically, it
applies to operational capacity building, both civil and military. It is
an element of acknowledged standardization of procedures. [In the
defense sector, when forces are deployed, they need **flexible** and
effective means of countering threats; while in the field of
cyber-security, they need **agility** in operational network centric
**op**eration**s**, and constant accurate flow of
**info**rmation.]{.underline}

[Strategic resilience in cyber-security requires flexible adaptability
to new challenges]{.underline}. [Its **strategic resilience** works as a
tool for closeness, mitigation, and/or **negotiation**; it
[allows]{.mark} for **[coop]{.mark}**eration [among]{.mark} allies or
[members]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[NATO's vigilance and resilience in security-led affairs including
cyber-security [defines]{.mark} strategic **[plans]{.mark}** and
re-assesses **risks** that will [allow us to think **entrepreneurial**
and **innovative**]{.mark}. For NATO members]{.underline}, Heads of
State, and Governments, [cyber-security creates a modern administrative
and operational format and framework of the alliance at a virtual level
that is flexible and e-oriented, [reflective to]{.mark} the **[market
needs]{.mark}** for security and stability, while [augmenting]{.mark}
market **[e-innovation]{.mark}** and while [adapting]{.mark} to [**new
affordable methods**]{.mark} of **economic** and socio-economic
**growth**. NATO acquires protection mechanisms [while]{.mark} its
**[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** and memberships
**[enlarge]{.mark}** while operational [challenges are]{.mark} upgraded
and **[updated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. NATO needs to provide militarily
and technologically agile and interoperable forces with added value,
through civilian capabilities (NATO's Cyber-Defense Policy, 2011).

[Resilience in security-led affairs through innovation and
entrepreneurship therefore should be [a **leveled adaptation
process**]{.mark} for NATO; a phase to consequently strategize and draw
new scenarios for cyber-security]{.underline} among others. [This comes
through operational result processes of **training** and
**experiences**, when countered in an effective manner [with
**lessons**]{.mark} to be [**learned**]{.mark} constantly [in
**adaptable** new circumstances]{.mark} against any forms of
cyber-attacks.]{.underline}

[Resilience becomes thus a policy orientation for NATO's **["Smart
Defense"]{.mark}** clause.]{.underline} [NATO
[boosts]{.mark}]{.underline} on **[[military
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [methods of operational
support]{.underline} and deliverables [and protection mechanisms, while
remaining relevant as a political military organization]{.underline}, a
regional and global asset value to security and strategy application at
a time of vast changes and challenges.

#### The plan undermines our tech edge 

Camille **Grand 20**, NATO's Assistant Secretary General for Defence
Investment, Matthew Gillis, Defence Investment Staff Officer at NATO HQ,
\"Alliance capabilities at 70: achieving agility for an uncertain
future\", NDC Policy Brief No. 01, Jan 2020,
<http://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1408>

Secondly, [the pace of change has accelerated at a tempo that risks
outpacing our ability to exploit and, as necessary, counter the
technological advancements on the horizon. Many of these technologies
are driving towards **[faster]{.mark}** and [more **distributed**
decision-making]{.mark}, which in turn [bumps up against]{.mark} the
sometimes [**bureaucratic** and **conservative**]{.mark} nature of
[NATO]{.mark}'s machinery and [**decision making**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**Posturing the Alliance to fully embrace these tech**]{.mark}nologies
**[will require]{.mark}** an adapted mindset and culture of delegating
authority and **[accepting ambiguity.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

One case for improvement is in the area of NATO processes, particularly
those that manage procurements, standardization, and capability life
cycles. [We often strive for perfection in our future requirements, and
engineer our processes around [**numerous decision gates** and
**complicated management structures**]{.mark}. The [result is]{.mark} a
[capability]{.mark} that can be [**over budget**, **late**, and
**obsolete** when delivered. NATO has taken]{.mark} some [healthy
steps]{.mark} in this direction [with]{.mark} the adoption of [a **new
model**]{.mark} for governing common funded capabilities [with fewer
decisions]{.mark} and streamlined oversight. [But **continued efforts
are needed.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Industry also has a substantial role to play in this area. [Our]{.mark}
traditional **[d]{.mark}**efence **[i]{.mark}**ndustrial
**[b]{.mark}**ase [should not be]{.mark} complacent with a business
model that can be slow, cumbersome, and **[risk
averse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In what Klaus Schwab has defined as the
"fourth Industrial Revolution", [the changes on the horizon "herald the
transformation of entire systems of production, management, and
governance"]{.underline}1 [while entirely upending existing industrial
value chains. **The [success of Allies' industries will depend on more
acceptance of risk]{.mark}**, greater investment in research and
development, and an adapted mindset towards partnering with players
outside the traditional defence sphere.]{.underline}

#### The impact is great power war

Jim **Talent et al 19**, Senior Fellow, Bipartisan Policy Center, Former
U.S. Senator (R-MO), Robert O. Work, Distinguished Senior Fellow, Center
for a New American Security, Former Deputy Secretary of Defense,
12/3/19, \"The Contest for Innovation: Strengthening America's National
Security Innovation Base in an Era of Strategic Competition\", Report of
the Task Force on 21st-Century National Security Technology and
Workforce, The Ronald Reagan Institute,
https://www.reaganfoundation.org/media/355297/the_contest_for_innovation_report.pdf

[The **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates has entered an era of
long-term [**competition**]{.mark} with **revisionist powers**. A key
aspect of this competition [will revolve around]{.mark} a contest for
**[tech]{.mark}**nological **[superiority]{.mark}** waged
[between]{.mark} the national **innovation bases** of the respective
competitors. [The outcome]{.mark} of this competition [will
determine]{.mark} not just American national security but also how the
nations of the world interact---and [whether a **free and open**]{.mark}
political and economic [**system** will remain]{.mark} the foundation of
those interactions.]{.underline}

After a long post-Cold War focus on rogue regional powers and nearly two
decades of continuous warfare in the Middle East and a focus on rogue
regional powers, [the United States now faces a new defining national
security challenge: a long-term strategic competition with a resurgent
[**Russia** and]{.mark} a rising **[China]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Russia [seeks to reestablish]{.mark} itself as a **[global
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While Russia is able to compete with the
United States militarily in certain domains, its economic outlook and
long-term demographic prospects are grim. Accordingly, it is unlikely to
develop and nurture a true national innovation ecosystem. Given these
disadvantages, [Russia is limited to acting as a **geostrategic
spoiler** seeking [to]{.mark} undermine and [weaken the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates, its **[alliances]{.mark}**, and
its global interests.]{.underline}

China, on the other hand, is already challenging the United States
economically, militarily, and politically. China's economy has surpassed
that of the United States in terms of purchasing power parity and could,
under some scenarios, pass the U.S. GDP in absolute terms in the mid- to
late 2020s. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, China
defines its vital national interests in ways that are irreconcilable
with both the interests of the United States and the values of
self-determination and individual freedom to which we and our allies are
committed. [[China's]{.mark} global expansion, from both a trade and
military perspective, is [challenging the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [in]{.mark} virtually **[every region of the
world.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[In pursuit of its goal of reshaping the world order, China aims to
supplant the **U**nited **S**tates as the world's **leading
tech**nological **power** by 2030. China has articulated a distinct
strategy of statedriven innovation, defined by its concept of
"military--civil fusion," to lead the world in cutting-edge technologies
that might allow it to leapfrog the United States both economically and
militarily.]{.underline}

That strategy presents a two-fold challenge for the United States.
Economically, the challenge is to sustain American prosperity and access
to markets on equal terms with other nations against China's ambition to
control the economic sectors that will determine national primacy in the
decades ahead.

[Militarily, [the]{.mark} fundamental [mission]{.mark} of the U.S.
government (USG) [is to **deter a great-power war** and, if deterrence
fails, to **prevent escalation**]{.mark} of the conflict and end the war
on terms favorable to the United States and its allies. [An important
**key**]{.mark} to this mission [is]{.mark} achieving and maintaining
**[military--tech]{.mark}**nical [**superiority**.]{.mark}
However,]{.underline} over the last several decades,
[China---and]{.underline}, to a lesser extent, [Russia---has invested
heavily in advanced military capabilities specifically aimed at
overcoming the technological lead of America's armed
forces.]{.underline}

[As a result, [the **conventional overmatch**]{.mark} that [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has relied upon]{.mark} to **undergird**
its **deterrence** posture since the end of the Cold War [is
**eroding**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The balance of power in East Asia has
already shifted substantially in China's direction. [[If this]{.mark}
trend [continues]{.mark}, effective [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} in
that region [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[fail, leaving the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [to face]{.mark} the unattractive
alternatives of accepting aggression against its interests or its allies
or triggering **[armed conflict]{.mark}** with the]{.underline} People's
Liberation Army [(PLA), with all the attendant risks of
escalation.]{.underline}

The point of departure for any contemporary analysis of the means and
ends of innovation for national security should be the 2018 National
Defense Strategy (NDS).1 The strategy describes [a complex and dynamic
security environment marked primarily by a renewal of rivalry
[among]{.mark} the **[major powers]{.mark}**]{.underline} and with it
new forms of strategic competition and new forms of strategic conflict.
Among the dynamic elements it highlights is [the technological
dimension: **[strategic competition]{.mark}** with Russia and China [is
characterized by a]{.mark} seemingly [**relentless drive** to
develop]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**new tech**]{.mark}nologies---
[**advanced computing**, **big data**]{.mark} analytics,
**[a]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence, [**autonomy**,
**directed energy**, **hypersonics**,]{.mark} and
**[biotech]{.mark}**nology. **[Multiple simultaneous
tech]{.mark}**nological [**revolutions**]{.mark} are likely to
significantly [impact the **character of war**. The competitor that
**best harnesses**]{.mark} these **[tech]{.mark}**nologies [will have
the **advantage** in]{.mark} fighting and **[winning the wars of the
future]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The NDS exhorts the nation to [foster a
competitive mindset]{.underline} and emphasizes the need [to "out-think,
out-maneuver, out-partner, and out-innovate" our competitors and
potential adversaries.]{.underline}

It is not surprising that the NDS focuses on
**[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** as [a [**key** to **out-competing
adversaries**]{.mark} during a period of rapid technological
change.]{.underline} At the same time, the NDS hints that technological
innovation is a necessary, but not sufficient condition, for
outinnovating the competition. [[As tech]{.mark}nology
[advances]{.mark}, the nation's [military must]{.mark} also seek to
[innovate its **operational concepts**]{.mark} and
**[doctrine]{.mark}**, as well as its
**[organizations]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Each is explored below.

#### Coordinating tech innovation solves all global challenges\-\--saves humanity

Daniel **Araya 20**, PhD, Public Policy, University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, Senior Partner with the World Legal Summit and Senior
Fellow with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, 9/1/20,
\"Is The Venus Project The Next Stage In Human Evolution?\", Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielaraya/2020/09/01/is-the-venus-project-the-next-stage-in-human-evolution/#1d09e43c5c35

[A seismic shift is under way. Against the backdrop of rising
temperatures, collapsing ecosystems, and the threat of species
extinction, technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics
are now moving to transform the global order]{.underline}. Indeed, for
the first time in our history, [we have the tools and technologies to
guide and shape our evolution. But what will this future look
like?]{.underline}

I recently spoke with Roxanne Meadows and Nathanael Dinwiddie of The
Venus Project to better understand their thoughts on the future. As they
explain, the status quo is no longer working. [Climate change, social
inequality, and technological innovation are now disrupting a
market-driven society. [The key to resolving]{.mark} these [global
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}, they suggest, [is rooted in a
[R]{.mark}esource [B]{.mark}ased [E]{.mark}conomy.]{.underline}

The term "Resource Based Economy" was first coined by Jacque Fresco, the
founder of The Venus Project. Fresco believed that [a Resource Based
Economy could support the scientific [integration of]{.mark} automating
technologies ([AI and robotics]{.mark}) and engineering systems in
providing the highest possible living standards]{.underline}. Meadows
and Dinwiddie suggest that [this kind of economy is the next stage in
human evolution.]{.underline} But what do they mean?

1\. What is The Venus Project?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: The Venus Project is a non-profit organization
that presents a new socio-economic model utilizing science and
technology. For the past 40 years, we have maintained a 21-acre research
center in Venus, Florida. We propose [a new scientific
foundation]{.underline} in [[transcending humanity's]{.mark} current
[problems]{.mark} by]{.underline} testing a new social design for
[organizing our society as a global "operating system".]{.underline}

Taken as a whole, the Venus Project fills the egregious gap between the
sciences and the humanities by combining a social philosophy of the
future [with technical knowledge applied at a global scale to solve the
problems of the human condition]{.underline}. Our methodologies are
designed [to realize the full potential of science and technology to
achieve social betterment for all living systems]{.underline}--- without
exception. Our approach to social organization calls for changes in
governance, economics, urban planning, education, human relationships,
language, and values.

2\. We appear to be in the early stages of a massive economic
depression. What is your sense of what is happening politically and
economically right now?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: We are witnessing an unprecedented political
polarization and economic disruption around the world today. The status
quo is no longer working. [Many people are now beginning to understand
how dysfunctional the management of nations, peoples, and resources has
been. Human needs and the needs of our environment are far too complex
to be managed by political means, arbitrary economic direction, or an
elite without the relevant understanding of science and
technology.]{.underline}

Compounding this problem, [nature operates as a closed-loop system, but
we do not. We extract [resources]{.mark} without replenishing them,
accumulate [waste]{.mark} materials without recycling them, and we
pollute our [air, water]{.mark}, and [food]{.mark} crops for the need to
maintain competitive profit margins. There are [many]{.mark} other
[factors converging]{.mark} at once besides the pandemic, all of which
[contribute to]{.mark} the system's [unrest]{.mark}.]{.underline}

3\. Younger generations seem disaffected with Capitalism. Could you
describe your vision of a post-scarcity society?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: The Venus Project recognizes that if we utilize
[a global systems approach as a basis for organizing and managing
resources]{.underline}, we can design a much more humane environment for
all. Our goal is to advance the health and the protection of the
ecosystem, as opposed to the accumulation of wealth, property, and
power. We do not have enough money to fulfill the needs of the world's
people, but we do have enough resources, if wisely managed. Ultimately,
it is not money that people need, but unencumbered access to the
necessities of life and self actualization.

[Accomplishing this is a technical and engineering challenge [requiring
massive coordination]{.mark} by transdisciplinary teams of engineers and
scientists in [managing]{.mark} the Earth's [resources within]{.mark}
its [carrying capacity]{.mark}. This kind of scientific endeavor [would
eliminate]{.mark} the vicious [rivalries over]{.mark} scarce
[resources]{.mark} and, in turn, generate very different behavior
amongst people.]{.underline}

Briefly, this is what Jacque Fresco, founder of The Venus Project,
termed a "Resource Based Economy". [This is a necessary step for
humanity's evolution. It could be thought of as a new science, a science
of Earth Management where, by necessity, all of Earth's resources become
the common heritage of all the world's people.]{.underline}

4\. How does the Venus Project differ from Socialism or Communism?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: Rather than worker revolts and the forcible
overthrow of the system (Communism), or the redistribution of capital
(Socialism), The Venus Project approaches social change as a process of
guided evolution. In our view, [the challenges before us are a matter of
engineering and design]{.underline}. The Venus Project calls for an
experimental analysis of a new social system. This system is unlike any
communist revolution, utopian commune, or coup d'état tried in the past.

In our view, [[the fundamental issue]{.mark} limiting social management
in the past [has been]{.mark} the [lack of]{.mark} an effective
[data-driven methodology for]{.mark} evaluating and [improving the
system]{.mark}'s functioning.]{.underline} Full-scale blanket
application of social policies to vast geographic areas--- be it through
revolution or legislation--- without a means for evaluating their
effectiveness, follows from an approach heavy in ideology but short in
scientific method. The Venus Project calls for iterative prototyping of
cities that we take as the unit of analysis in validating or falsifying
hypotheses. All of this begins with testing a prototype, not a
revolution.

Although Karl Marx did envision a society wherein money, private
property, and social hierarchy were abolished, he could not begin to
imagine how to implement this system at a technical level. In contrast
to Communism, The Venus Project calls for [the total redesign of cities
(transportation, distribution, manufacturing, recycling, infrastructure)
to produce abundance of goods and services.]{.underline} This is
[achieved through automation and optimized infrastructural
efficiency.]{.underline}

5\. What role does technology and automation play in The Venus Project?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: [For the first time in history, we have the tools
and technology to guide and shape our evolution]{.underline}. To
accomplish this, The Venus Project advocates the humane and intelligent
use of technology and the methods of science directed toward the
well-being of all people and the environment which sustains all life.

In our view, technology and automation should be strictly used for
social betterment and to eliminate repetitive, dangerous and monotonous
work. If automation displaces a job, for example, that means all people
would gain more access to the products those machines produce. The
necessities of life are distributed without a fee with the aim of
expanding to all goods and services. Consequently, there is no threat
resulting from technological labor displacement. On the contrary,
[technology and automation have the potential for enhancing the world's
standard of living]{.underline}, enabling people to learn, spend time
with their families, travel, [and confront the new frontier of
challenges in improving the resilience of the system as a
whole.]{.underline}

6\. How do you envision utilizing AI in decision-making?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: [Applying the methods of science and technology
(including AI) to the operation of the world's societies will lead to a
substantially more reliable functioning of support systems than we have
today. Homelessness, [starvation, war, and environment]{.mark}al
degradation [are consequences of]{.mark} today's political and economic
approaches to [decision-making]{.mark}. A [R]{.mark}esource
[B]{.mark}ased [E]{.mark}conomy operates within a unified systems
approach that utilizes the methods of science and AI to arrive at the
most appropriate decisions at any given time]{.underline}. Unlike
today's implementation of technology, this new approach would be
carefully carried out with the utmost human and environmental concern.
[The real-time influx of quantitative and qualitative data [would
provide real-time feedback, enabling humanity to]{.mark} constantly
observe and [continually improve]{.mark} the operation of the system
over time.]{.underline}

7\. What are the future goals of The Venus Project?

Meadows and Dinwiddie: At present, we are focused on formalizing and
systematizing the body of work of The Venus Project's founder, Jacque
Fresco. In an age that is sorely lacking an approach updated to current
knowledge and capability, we enter uncharted territory with the methods
of science to help us through. This is the crucial job that no one has
attempted, until now.

In the short term, we are focused on a systems approach to organize a
holistic understanding of the natural world and human culture. This
involves understanding economics and human social systems in the broader
contexts of Earth processes and ecosystems, and communicating this
understanding through books, videos, the internet, podcasts, transmedia
storytelling, and course curricula.

In the mid-term, we aim to fulfill the [desperate need for]{.underline}
the [strategic coordination of consilience by synthesizing the knowledge
of academia and the know-how of industry. [This network of intelligence
will produce a]{.mark} transdisciplinary research agenda, research
program, and [global theory of change]{.mark}]{.underline}. Constructing
a new planning center will function as a living lab and think tank
devoted to designing the first prototype city.

In the long term, The Venus Project hopes to see the construction of new
prototype cities for the purpose of testing the hypothesis of [a
holistic, technical design-solution for a social system.]{.underline}
Iterations of these prototypes [will form a worldwide network of
cities]{.underline}. The study of these cities will function as [the
basis for a science of Earth management, the models of which guide the
intelligent allocation of resources for the purpose of optimizing
civilization to adapt and evolve in relationship with an Earth
ecology.]{.underline}

There is a lot to consider and we welcome participation in the
development of such a system.

### Overview\-\--Turns Case\-\--NATO/Russia

#### Innovation provides the adaptability NAO needs to meet future strategic challenges

Statecraft in London, ""NATO@70": still adapting after all these years",

No. 08, Jan 2020, http://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1414

[Future adaption: what are the most likely evolutions of the Alliance
looking forward?]{.underline}

[The **complexity** of NATO's future **adaptation** challenge must not
be under-estimated. The [**modernisation** of Russia]{.mark}'s armed
forces [is part of]{.mark} a new form of complex [**strategic coercion**
that employs **systematic pressure** across **5Ds**]{.mark} of
disinformation, destabilisation, disruption, deception and implied
destruction. Moscow's enduring aim is to use the implicit threat of
force [to keep]{.mark} the Western [allies **permanently**]{.mark}
strategically, politically and militarily **[off-balance]{.mark}** and
the threat of overwhelming force [as a form of]{.mark} strategic
**[extortion]{.mark}** racket focused on those at the margins of the
Alliance.]{.underline} As a consequence, future adaptation and the
Alliance concept of deterrence and defence will require an entirely new
and innovative concept of protection and projection.

[The nature of future war must also be seen within the context of the
emerging complex strategic coercion that Russia is pioneering.
**[Tech]{.mark}**nology-**[led]{.mark}** [**cross-domain**
**war**]{.mark}fare [will]{.mark} see the battlespace [become an]{.mark}
integrated [**air**, **sea**, **land**, **space**, **cyber**,]{.mark}
information (including electronic warfare) and knowledge
**[super-domain]{.mark}** for the conduct of operations. Faced with such
threats transatlantic political [**cohesion** and]{.mark} Alliance
military [**interoperability** will be **vital**. The Alliance]{.mark}
and its member states [must be in the **vanguard** of the **Revolution**
in **Military Tech**]{.mark}nology that is [now underway.
**A**]{.mark}rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence, **[quantum]{.mark}**
computing and [**machine-learning**, **nano-tech**]{.mark}nologies,
**[drone]{.mark}** and other semi or fully **[autonomous]{.mark}**
delivery systems [are now appearing in a **battlespace** that stretches
from]{.mark} the depths of [the **oceans to outer-space**, **across all
landmasses**]{.mark}, and within and between changing societies and
communities.]{.underline}

[Adapting NATO to meet the strategic challenges of the twenty-first
century must thus be the priority]{.underline} for "NATO@70". [If not,
[there is a]{.mark} very [**real danger** the Alliance will lack the
**nimbleness**]{.mark} to meet strategic change and technological
developments, [and ultimately **fail**]{.mark} as a
consequence]{.underline}. There is also a danger that [Alliance cohesion
will]{.underline} progressively [fade]{.underline} if such ambitions are
not properly enunciated through a new Strategic Concept that enshrines
at its heart a new form of flexible response. Above all, European words
must be matched by European deeds through further organisational and
internal reform to enable a properly agile and modernised Alliance that
would give meaning to the 360-degree approach and enable the Allies to
strike a balance between technology, capability and affordability

Operationally, national and [[**cooperative forces** need to be
**continuously agile**]{.mark} and technologically advanced. In an
asymmetrical world]{.underline}, which is complete [[with
**unforeseen**]{.underline}]{.mark} challenges and [[**threats**, we
need]{.mark} forces with [**flexibility**, **adaptability**]{.mark},
operational and strategic [command structure, based on]{.mark} high
technologically sophisticated **[info]{.mark}**rmation [**"coming
in,"**]{.mark} but also being used [while in training or]{.mark} through
[active op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}.]{.underline}

On a theoretical scale, the current article requests a cyber-security
strategic framework adoption of resilient adaptability and
interoperability policy in the framework of safety and defense. The
article considers that [[understanding]{.mark} the realities of [threats
is **by definition a natural innovation**]{.mark} and [as we move ahead,
we structure and operate]{.mark} a single [strategy]{.mark} on
cyber-security [against a]{.mark} virtual [threat **from wherever it
comes from**]{.mark}. Its [long-term resilience may be **more complex**
as]{.mark} operational [capacity needs to constantly]{.mark} develop and
[adapt]{.mark} into the convergence of societal structures, and methods;
where socio-economic, technological, defense even health, and education
issues are affected.]{.underline}

When theory on cyber-security, resilience, and operational capacity will
be applied [at NATOs level, [it will **enable**]{.mark} allies and
**[members]{.mark}**, jointly, [to create]{.mark} a [true]{.mark} policy
and strategy for **[cyber-security resilience]{.mark}** against hybrid
virtual threats.]{.underline} The methodology on how to is presented
through this current article.

### UQ\-\--Smart Defense\-\--2NC Solves Case

#### The DA is a status quo gradualism counterplan with an external impact of tech dominance

#### Smart Defense solves the case now\-\--it's a defense posture to hybrid threats that uses bottom-up, business-led input to determine how we should respond\-\--but broad Article 5 interpretation is key\-\--it incentivizes tech innovation in order to stay prepared against all hybrid threats

#### Smart Defense solves clarifies NATO's response to hybrid threats\-\--avoids over and under reactions

Associating smart defense with cyber-resilience: "engagement through
policy adaptation"

As fiscal austerity measures are applied and cutbacks are in effect,
according to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, [NATO allies have to
decide on methods to approach NATOs political agenda
decisions]{.underline}. Allies must enhance capacities and capabilities
to implement new and innovative methods of tactical management for the
benefit of security toward the Alliance space (Chicago Council on Global
Affairs, 2012). According to the Atlantic Council, "...The Alliance,
given its new strategic landscape, currently finds itself in, requires a
new strategy. [[NATO's]{.mark} current three core tasks---[collective
defense]{.mark}, crisis management, and cooperative security---are
['tasks']{.mark} but not strategies---they [do not identity]{.mark} the
full spectrum of [ends, ways, and means]{.mark}, and therefore [do not
tell]{.mark} the Alliance and its [members]{.mark} either [what to
do]{.mark} or the risks involved. NATO has been working diligently but
without great clarity or common agreement as to its end
goals]{.underline} (NATO's Cyber-Defense Policy, 2011)".

Heads of States and Governments do listen and observe, but are not keen
in stepping in the extra mile; to therefore consult and call on NATO to
hold Summit meetings, to negotiate or mitigate current issues, and to
elaborate and concentrate more on economic, political, military and
management innovation and efficiency of administrative cooperation in
all policy regulated fields of NATO.

[A strategic framework policy on "[Smart Defense]{.mark}," which is yet
to be achieved by 2020, may render a cheaper cost for the total sharing
of burden by member states, while [attract]{.mark}ing [more]{.mark}
elements or [variables where tech]{.mark}nology [can be used]{.mark} to
minimize costs]{.underline}. Surely, not all members share the same
burden to this day by are reflective to all countries security defenses
when it comes to cyberspace.

While a policy on smart defense lowers overall long-term cost, and if
burden sharing is actually increased but equaled to lower levels of
fiscal sharing, long-term results will show, that in fact, [less cost
will be achieved and [cyber-innovative methods can]{.mark} help
[mitigate]{.mark} possible [costs]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[While cyber-security becomes a core, NATO policy for smart defense and
resilience attracts attention to stake holders. [Through
evolving]{.mark} and [constant communication]{.mark} and marketing
perspectives, social media and workshops, and conferences, cyber-defense
should continue to be promoted and have a clear aim]{.underline}.
Reflecting on the needs for a global element of cyber-security against
current and emerging challenges, exchange of scientific information and
operational processes promote such ideology, where experts from around
the world exchange information and discuss the risk assessments and how
to manage.

Cyber-security then works as a "decree of specialization, which now
requires adaptation if not done so already for each member state",
politically, strategically, tactically, and operationally but also
legally. Cyber-security must and should always be provided as a
methodological tool for operational success of NATO against current and
emerging threats. It is and will always be a tool for a joint framework
of cooperation, globally.

As smart defense is being upgraded and developed, cyber-defense "...not
a conception but a real-politic issue... (Efthymiopoulos, 2008b)",
should remain an element of specialization policy, a key for concrete
strategic engagement of all resilient member states. It will emerge to
become a policy of innovative unity among states (political) yet also
business continuity (strategic orientation) about the future of NATO
(The entrepreneurial and managerial side of things).

[[NATO's]{.mark} strategic [approach post]{.mark} Warsaw and Brussels of
2017 and [2018]{.mark} Summits is estimated to [reflect a]{.mark} much
need [realistic plan of]{.mark} operations and engagement in the field
of [cyber-security]{.mark} and defense. [NATO]{.mark} should continue to
be collective to be a force projector and force protector. It
[should]{.mark} [not limit its role and actions but should allow and
seek out enlarged coop]{.mark}erations tailored to the global and
regional needs [to counter]{.mark} the existing [challenges]{.mark} or
emerging challenges, considering]{.underline} that as aforementioned
[challenges are now borderless.]{.underline}

[Cyber-security and technological progress within NATO are synonymous.
They can therefore be seen as [the core of]{.mark} collaboration on
[smart defense, to be finalized and achieved by 2020]{.mark} standards.
Cyber-security being technologically advanced is]{.underline} [resilient
to changes]{.underline} [and is innovative as a method as it was never
been done before at NATO until the date that it was presented to. It
[does]{.mark} [provide adaptable]{.mark} technological architecture and
[posture]{.mark}]{.underline}, which will be discussed below considering
the opportunities but also challenges. It will provide robust
deliverables with minimum human capital, fiscal but requests technical
deliverables.

### UQ\-\--Smart Defense\-\--AT: UQ Overwhelms

**It\'s going to be finalized this year\-\--but the aff undermines
efficiencies by creating gaps in coverage**

Security and Strategic Affairs on NATO issues and NATO-Russia relations,

By 2008, seven Alliance countries according to the Memorandum of
Understanding on the cyber-defense center, supported Estonia to get full
operational capability (Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and
Spain), which lead to an evolution period. By 2016, [NATO [Allies are
expected to]{.mark} discuss further and [finalize the framework]{.mark},
logistics, and operations, elements of cyber-resilience and procedures
on the policies, when considering threats and challenges in a changing
environment. NATO is yet to decide on the resilience policy, as hybrid
warfare is developing, at a time when smart defense of NATO nations are
expected to achieve the goals and aims which are to be seen [by]{.mark}
the year [2020]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The cyber-attacks in Estonia of 2007 are still today the biggest and
most organized electronic attack, with a duration period of several
weeks, provided NATO with a motive and multipurpose task for years to
come. [[NATO's leadership was]{.mark} in fact correct in its judgment
that (1) such an operational center and policy was needed, (2) its
operational center would [constantly]{.mark} be [evaluating]{.mark} and
evaluated, and would research on prospective [evolutions in
tech]{.mark}nology, malware, and cyber-security (3) that NATO requires
resilience when considering the current or future threats and
challenges.]{.underline}

[The inauguration of its Cooperative Cyber-Defense Centre of Excellence
(CCDCOE) in Tallinn Estonia in May 2008, led to a mission, which holds a
clear vision and statement. It is yet to be "politically ratified" and
adopted as a key core policy by Allies. Its raison d'être as stated is
"to enhance the cooperative Cyber-Defence capability of NATO and NATO
nations, thus improving the Alliance's interoperability in the field of
cooperative Cyber-Defence,"]{.underline} therefore [reflecting on the
key core elements to counter hybrid threats and be constantly resilience
to strategic requests and needs]{.underline}. The vision is for the
CCDCOE to become "a specialized and expertise center for NATO in
cooperative cyber-defense" (CCDCOE, Training Catalogue, n.d.).

The domain of the cooperative cyber defense center in the framework of
cooperative security within NATO focuses in the fields of research which
include:

"Legal and policy elements"

Concepts and strategy

Tactical environment

Critical information infrastructure protection (NATO, 2016c)

The Centre's core policy created an outcome of research and
policy-orientation, as already analyzed. It was presented primarily as a
first outcome, then accepted by the Supreme Commander Allied Command
Transformation (SACT), deriving from a request of NATO HQ (Headquarters)
and by the North Atlantic Council (NAC) level. This included Doctrine
and Concept Development, Awareness and Training, Research and
Development Analysis, and Lessons learned and finally Consultation.

[In July 2018 during the Brussels NATO meeting, the Heads of States and
Governments agreed to the opening of [the cyberspace center]{.mark} as
part of the new NATO command structure reform that [provides]{.mark}
more agility and [assurances of]{.mark} operational
[preparedness]{.mark}, while ensuring force command operations and
agility]{.underline} (Efthymiopoulos, 2013). [The agreement includes a
creation of policy and action reflecting key core issues including a
framework policy for the cyberspace operations center of NATO to learn
and coordinate in operations how [to counter emerging
challenges.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Results: NATO innovates with reflection to cyber-security

In terms of cyber-security, the [Centre for Excellence in Tallinn
continues to portray and project NATOs need for a methodological
cyber-resilience policy. [At]{.mark} NATO [Brussels]{.mark} summit,
[cyber-security became operational]{.mark}. Therefore, NATOs
cyber-defense policy and [smart]{.mark} efficient [methods]{.mark} while
also requested for more interoperability agility and security resilience
in the field of cyber-security [becomes a core
policy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The attempt as an idea and method to reach out on cyber-security agility
of forces for operations is not a new one. On February 6th and 7th 2009,
NATO's Science for Peace and Security (SPS) sponsored a workshop. It
foresighted the possibility of cyber-security framework. Something we
commend through this article: a framework strategy for operational and
efficient cyber-security to become a core policy of resilience at NATO.
The 2009 workshop titled "Operational Network Intelligence: Today and
tomorrow" aimed at adaptation knowledge procedures considering the
evolving and fast growing technology. It spoke about innovation and
entrepreneurship. It talked about methodological approaches that may
bring allies together, while bring cooperative sides together in
investment through R&D opportunities.

Its overall purpose therefore was to introduce the possibility of
innovation: "rethink present strategies and identify urgent measures to
be taken in order to minimize the strategic and economic impacts of
cyber-attacks" (NATO, 2009b). This was the level of anticipation at the
time; considering future correlation of smart-defense with the policy of
cyber-defense at its core. In 2019, innovation seems to be a sound but
lone option; a process where through cooperative security and military
and technological entrepreneurship NATO can move forward.

[In 2019, considering the risk assessments on hybrid
threats]{.underline} and challenges (Davis Jr., 2015), [the need for
better civil awareness and readiness, at a time of much needed
cooperative defense, [Allies have to decide for a]{.mark} robust
[long-term]{.mark} planning innovative and [entrepreneurial
strategy]{.mark} for current and future operations of NATO. [Keeping in
mind the need for]{.mark} strong [success]{.mark} in field operations,
including success in and at a multi-dimensional level of operations
[against all threats while making op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} to be
[cost efficient]{.mark} with minimum human casualty
numbers.]{.underline}

[NATO increasingly recognizes that organized [cyber-attacks]{.mark} seek
to [take advantage of "gaps"]{.mark} in the "system social and market
matrix."]{.underline} Therefore, it should be a request from member
states to examine the increasing need for coordination of human factors
related to the issues of electronic warfare, operational network,
intelligence, and cyber-defense, whether for training, scientific
exchange, and or operations (NATO Review, 2015).

NATO is currently using people involved in e-systems, security, IT
engineers, researches, officers dealing with network operations and
operational centres, as well as professional and academics, among others
including military specialists. [[Specialists]{.mark} in the field on
both a strategic and tactical levels [should continue to be
systematically involved]{.mark} at organized levels of research,
sharing, discussion, and exhibition of outcomes, [which will]{.mark} in
turn [enrich]{.mark} the abilities, capabilities, and capacities of
rendering current [smart-defense]{.mark} and cyber-security [as
a]{.mark} key and [successful]{.mark} resilient and collaborative
[defense policy to NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### UQ\-\--Smart Defense\-\--AT: No Smart Defense Now

As previously noted, cyber-security capabilities in a smart and
resilient way is the "operational goal." NATO members prepare well and
also at joint levels. **[[NATO's Smart
Defense]{.underline}]{.mark}**,Footnote1 [a policy framework for
defensive tactical advice and operations, [**used** to be the method
that]{.mark} among others [branded the **need for a cyber-security

[adopted]{.mark}]{.underline} during the Warsaw Summit
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} July [[2016 and
reflective]{.underline}]{.mark} to the July NATO summit [[in 2018,
expects allies to take **continued actions** through **standardized

and its [new **cyberspace**]{.mark} operations

[What is **[well known]{.mark}** through policy analysis is [that

operational and tactical levels, so as to [operate in]{.mark} and around
**["article and non-article 5

### UQ\-\--Tech Innovation

#### NATO's proving its capable of innovative tech development now

Camille **Grand 20**, NATO's Assistant Secretary General for Defence
Investmen, Matthew Gillis, Defence Investment Staff Officer at NATO HQ,
\"Alliance capabilities at 70: achieving agility for an uncertain
future\", NDC Policy Brief No. 01, Jan 2020,
<http://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1408>

Blueprints for the future?

[The [**future outlook** for **disruptive tech**]{.mark}nology [is
**not**]{.mark} entirely **[negative]{.mark}**. Two [**new initiatives**
show]{.mark} exceptional [promise to invert traditional]{.mark}
capability development [models]{.mark}, while seizing upon the
opportunities offered by new technology. [They demonstrate]{.mark}
vividly [how **NATO adapts.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The first is [the Maritime Unmanned Systems
Initiative]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here, 14 Allies have committed to a
cooperative framework for developing and integrating unmanned systems
into NATO's defence architecture.2 The project is aimed at bringing
autonomy and unmanned capability to bear in support of tedious and
dangerous jobs at sea, including anti-submarine and counter-mine
warfare. Beyond leveraging new technology, the project is also
leveraging a "start up" mindset for agility and lean approaches. The
project has benefi ted from experience drawn from industry, academia,
and government, including Coca Cola and the Pentagon's Defense
Innovation Unit. This model has already paid dividends: less than a year
after the fi rst commitment was taken, the largest-ever exercise of NATO
unmanned underwater, surface and air vehicles took place off Portugal.3

[The second initiative is [the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control
capability]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a novel example of obsolescence
management, NATO leaders have committed to cooperate towards defi ning a
replacement for NATO's AWACS fl eet in anticipation of its retirement
around 2035. The project launched in 2016 with a fundamental
re-evaluation of NATO's future needs, eschewing any assumptions that
AWACS would simply undergo a "likefor-like" replacement. The project has
since arrived at capability requirements that drive for an integration
of surveillance and C2 across multiple domains. Allied industries have
now been challenged to offer ideas on how NATO's requirements could be
fulfi lled by 2035. Up to six concepts are being sought in order to
encourage a wide variety of innovative solutions, including those that
leverage emerging and disruptive technologies.

[Both of these projects [are in their early steps. Nevertheless]{.mark},
their models [are contesting]{.mark} the [traditional approaches to
defence acquisition]{.mark} by **[embracing disruptive
tech]{.mark}**nology, tapping into industry expertise, and [**leaving
space** for **future capability growth**]{.mark}**.** These projects
[**offer promise** for]{.mark} the [**future adaptability** and
**agility** of **NATO capability development**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
as such deserve close attention and support.

### Link Wall\-\--2NC

#### Commitment\-\--fully embracing emerging tech requires a defense posture that accounts for the uncertainty of future developments\-\--broad acceptance of risk increases the demand for new tech innovations

[In twenty-first century security affairs, NATO forces are required to
be well prepared for possible rules of engagement at all levels and
dimensions. They should be able [to counter]{.mark} symmetrical and
asymmetrical battles, threats or challenges, **[hybrid]{.mark}** or
non-hybrid. At the level of cyber-security and cyber-resilience and
preparedness, scenarios, of possible attacks and battles, can be
anticipated. Along the lines of the new cyber-space operations center,
NATO should prepare operational methods for action, whether this is for
defense or cooperation for cyber-space.]{.underline}

The use and necessity today of technology is limitless. So is the
virtual world of defense and security, where technology and
cyber-defense merge. These are the tools for action.
[**[Tech]{.mark}**nology [plays a **key role**]{.mark} in a global
reach. Yet [**so does NATO**, through the **framework** of]{.mark} a
**[limitless tech]{.mark}**nology applied [in **military
op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}**. NATO uses technology to train,
prepare, ready, deploy, and operate its forces.]{.underline} Technology
for NATO works as tools with which the Alliance protects and defend, yet
also is capable to counter-assault, with counter-measures where and when
is needed, required, or decided.

[Since the adoption of the NATO Cyber-Defense policy]{.underline}
(NATO's Cyber-Defense Policy, 2011), [[NATO trains]{.mark} its military
and civilian assets [for **possible action** against **possible
threats**.]{.mark} NATO is **[constantly]{.mark}** training its forces
in cyber defense]{.underline} training can be achieved through national,
bilateral even multilateral levels of NATO, [through the association of
member states, at the level of Centres of Excellence, such as the NATO
Cyber-Defense Centre for Excellence (CCDCOE)]{.underline} (NATO, n.d.)
[and now through the Cyberspace Operations center]{.underline} in Mons
Belgium. [[**Training and exercises** are]{.mark} now [anticipated to
**expand and enlarge**. So are **multinational
op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} held through remote areas
and locations. [[NATO is now to get **more engaged**]{.mark} in the
field of **cyber-defense**, in both operations and tactics. It is
anticipated within the Alliance that NATO is **well prepared**, both
[for **current** and **future**]{.mark} challenges, countering multiple
and multileveled dimensions of **[cyber-attacks]{.mark}**. Yet, it also
holds an open option, if necessary, to conduct counter-offensives to
prevent further escalation of cyber or military actions]{.underline}
(Hughes, 2009).

[NATO Missions, "will continue to require agile and interoperable,
well-trained and well-led military forces"]{.underline} (Carayannis,
Campbell & Efthymiopoulos, 2014). [This new technological and
operational environment through cyber-defense provides NATO with a new
level of technological possibilities, new tools for use against possible
threats but also protective "cyber-objectives." Allies have an added
policy, mission, and value. [**Ongoing** and **constant**
transformation]{.mark} through its operational and capacity building
resilience, [aims to reach]{.mark} in [**updated capabilities** and
**political excellence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in 2016. NATO aims for
well-coordinated missions in cooperation with and/or participation with
other international organizations, when prompted to react on
international threats or challenges. As such, [NATO has the ability to
continue to be a force and security provided in future potential
of]{.underline}, what we may call it, [the "online" security protection
initiative against all possibly known threats.]{.underline}

[NATO seeks excellence, in [achieving the **best**]{.mark} smartest
**[way to protect]{.mark}** but also counter-attack. By "nature," NATO
exists to prevent and defend member states from attacks. Through **smart
ways** and **agile training**, NATO can counter most known ways of
interface (whether virus or virtual) attacks or even e-spying
attempts.]{.underline}

#### Decision-making framework\-\--centralizing decision gates through complicated management structures ensures capabilities will be over budget, late, and obsolete when delivered\-\--government limitations get in the way of 'business-led' innovations

[During]{.underline} the year [2018, there was a new]{.underline}
security cultural security [comprehension]{.underline}; it is
[considered]{.underline} as [multi-leveled and
multi-dimensional]{.underline}. In 2018's NATO summit of July, [allies
evaluated current developments in cyber-security]{.underline}
considering challenges, threats, but also opportunities. Evaluated
current strategic and geopolitical challenges. [They upheld
methodological preparedness for network defense and operations and
declared under the new NATO command structural reform the setting up of
a cyberspace operations center]{.underline}, as part of the adapted
command structure. [Allies now request for more awareness and openness,
innovation methods, and capacity building in cyber-security, considering
changes in the market economy, more tangible and operational capacity
building through R&D companies. [**Any decision**, considering the
**changing nature of security**]{.mark} and strategic market, [should be

alliance, at a time of inside and outside NATO members' landscape
threats and challenges.

**[[Defense capacity building]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the twentieth

assessments.]{.underline} NATO is still to enhance but also maintaining
military capacities and military capabilities.

[The new strategic concept of NATO requests the alliance to move
forward. Twenty-first century needs and challenges require agility and
compatibility of forces and force command at all levels, including
network-centric operations and defense.]{.underline}

[NATO forces, force command, technology, and **[methodological
approach]{.mark}** in military elements and standards [**cannot**
be]{.mark} or remain [**static**. They need to]{.mark} technologically
advance, progress methodologically innovate, to [accommodate for
the]{.mark} increasing need for **[multi-dimensional ways of
security]{.mark}** and defense. NATO needs to have interoperable,
capable, and well-equipped technologically agile forces considering
innovation and entrepreneurial thinking in a period of technological
advance.]{.underline}

[In an emerging globalized world, where complexity may become a key
characteristic in strategy and security, **resilience** will become an
**integrated** part of NATOs policy orientation and
application.]{.underline} [[**New**]{.mark} vulnerabilities and
[**threats** continue to emerge. Political pressure will require
NATO]{.mark} leaders [to **take decisions**]{.mark} about the
organization's future]{.underline}. Yet all agree that NATO is a
necessity. As such, [[NATO should become **more open**]{.mark}, more
adaptable, [and]{.mark} more [**flexible**. With]{.mark}]{.underline}
more burden sharing, [[**better smart**]{.mark} budgeting,]{.underline}
long-term **[[planning]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and operational

[**organization** that **does more** to offer security]{.mark} and
strategic alignment to truly current but also **future** challenges and
**threats**, that we **may not yet anticipate** or think
of.]{.underline}

In the not so long past, such similar actions reaffirmed by the Heads of
States, included among others, the Treaty of London in 1990 Summit, to
the 1994 Summit in Brussels, and in 1999 over its 50th year anniversary
Summit in Washington, to the immediate decisions taken in 2001 after the
terrorist acts in the USA (NATO, 2001b) to its 60th anniversary, which
was held in Strasbourg and Kiehl accordingly in April 2009 to the
Chicago Summit of 2012 and the Wales Summit of 2014, which added value
to the Alliance and Allies reaffirming NATOs long-term necessity but now
also strategic resilience to multi-dimensional challenges and threats.

[Vulnerabilities and threats considering multidimensional challenges
such as [cyber-security require NATO to be]{.mark} truly, strategically
and operationally **[agile]{.mark}**. It requires NATO to be
**adaptable** to **conditions unforeseen**.]{.underline}

[Considering technological advancements, we are yet to acquaint
ourselves, our institutions, governments, and international
organizations with true phenomena of a new, yet networked global

now affect a region and possibly a larger area. [**Our abilities are

[**[NATO's]{.mark} concept of [cyber-defense]{.mark}** in
2019]{.underline}

It was NATO's Military Committee decision to adopt a "Cyber-Defense
Concept" (Efthymiopoulos, 2008e). The Committee's aim was and still is
to deliver business continuity and military resilience. [[As]{.mark}
NATO is a [provider of **collective defense**]{.mark} and as a
collective organization in a globalized and currently unsafe e-world, it
[needs to be **agile**]{.mark}. In an environment of insecurity, the
Alliance' delivers new policy results. Taking into perspective **new**
forms of asymmetrical **threats**, such as cyber-attacks.]{.underline}

Historically, [the 2002 Prague Summit first marked NATO's tasking
authority committee with regards to **all activities** that should be
held in relations to **cyber-defense**. **As tech**nical **achievements
were delivered**, so **policy-makers delivered policy** results on
cyber-defense. That is why, [Allied leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} during
the Riga Summit of 2006 [[acknowledged the need to]{.underline}]{.mark}
include these as is stated on its decisions at the Press Communiqué: (1)
to [protect NATO's operational information systems, and]{.underline} (2)
to [**[protect]{.mark}** its allied [countries from
**any**]{.mark}]{.underline} e-, or in other words
[**[cyber-attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} by new forms and means
developed by NATO's Allied Command Transformation (ACT) In Norfolk
Virginia.

[The output of the informal Meeting of the Ministers of Defense in
October 2007]{.underline} of NATO (NATO Defence Ministers Meeting, 2007)
[gave way to the inauguration of NATO's Center for Excellence (COE),
which at a later stage got accredited to]{.underline} have
[become]{.underline} the Allied Command Transformation on cyber-defense,
named as [Cooperative Cyber-Defense Centre of Excellence,
CCDCOE]{.underline} (NATO, 2008a). It [was [based on]{.mark} the concept
and early understanding of **[cyber-resilience]{.mark}** for NATO's
future policies in countering challenges and threats]{.underline}, as
was agreed by NATO's Military Committee.

[The central and final decision-making role over the policy of
cyber-defense however is the North Atlantic Council (NAC),]{.underline}
which accordingly is [led by Heads of State and Governments. This is the
highest deciding political authority which decides, creates, and
overviews policy.]{.underline} It also evaluates, considers, and adopts
NATO's policies and activities with regards to political and military
affairs or standing issues on challenges and threats, among others.
Below the NAC, is NATO's Consultation Control and Command Agency (NC3A)
(NATO NC3A, 2002) now transformed to the NCIA agency (NATO, 2008a) and
the NATO Military Authorities (NMA). The latter authority has
implementation as its major task (NATO's Cyber-Defence policy, 2008).

[The implementation of NATO's cyber-defense policy is considered as the
second most important decision by now, once the decisions are taken by
the NAC. The "Concept of Cyber-Defence" "adds practical action
**[programmes]{.mark}**, to [fit within]{.mark} the **[overarching
policy]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (NATO, 2009a). The "Cyber-Defence
Management Authority" that is tasked upon its policy concept "brings
together the key actors in NATO's Cyber-Defence activities." [Its aim is
[to]{.mark} manage and [support **all NATO**]{.mark} communication and
information networked **[systems]{.mark}** and individually allies upon
request]{.underline} (NATO, 2008c).

[NATO's policy creation and activity is "encouraged" by Allies. [The aim
is to **adapt the alliance to**]{.mark} the new strategic and security
environment that is "**[hybrid]{.mark}**" and [thus]{.mark} the creation
of [the **cyber**]{.mark}space operations **[center]{.mark}** in Mons in
Belgium. [To engage **as many**]{.mark} as **possible**
**[governments]{.mark}**, industry-related market [**companies**, and
**individuals**]{.mark}. In accordance to its best practice policy, NATO
considers that its "operational forum" can and should be considered as
the **best joint** operational **[coop]{.mark}**eration [between states
and market]{.mark}, as to also [avoid **duplication of efforts** and use
the **necessary**]{.mark} global [**knowledge** to achieve
**interoperability**]{.mark} of force action and **command** also in
cyber-space.]{.underline}

[Practically, in military policy, implementation, or operational areas,
NATO has adopted "three phases of practical activity and
cooperation":]{.underline} the initial phase includes a NATO Computer
Incident Response Capability (NCIRC). It was established as "interim
operating capability" for NATO to build up on both security risk and
manage the element of cyber-threats. Its second phase involved an ever
more realistic and pragmatic perspective that required the coordination
of all initial "offering" states to the attempt to establish a
cyber-center (under the NATO agreement between states of a voluntary
national contribution---VNC), in bringing the NCIRC to a full
operational capability (NATO, 2008c).

New and innovative policies were adopted. They were proposed and came to
effect (well-known procedure of internal NATO working process) until the
adoption of "MoU"; a memorandum of understanding was drafted and
proposed to NATO, by a sponsoring state which would establish a center
for cyber-training, in this case in Estonia.

From that point on, it became an administrative decision of the Allies,
that once the aforementioned stages would be put into effect, then a
third phase would come into existence. Needless to say, [this third
phase was a complete implementation and **[rule-based]{.mark}**
operational **[procedure]{.mark}** that would soon enough bring about
into existence NATO's request for technological agility and
resilience]{.underline}, which is finalized at the Warsaw Summit of July
2016. [It [consists of]{.mark} incorporating---**lessons
learned**---from the prior two phases as [using]{.mark} new and
**[latest]{.mark}** cyber-defense measures (use of new
**[tech]{.mark}**nology and getting more knowledge on the security
environment), in order [to enhance]{.mark} **cyber-defense
[posture]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Once the third phase was evaluated, the
Allied Command Transformation (ACT) decided, to accredit the operational
center---in this case the Cooperative Cyber Defense (CCD) COE (Estonia),
what is called as a "Centre of Excellence". In turn, this resulted to
the inauguration of the CCDCOE by May 2008.

#### Limiting Article 5 commitment to hybrid threats undermines cyberdefense integration

CDR Wiesław **Goździewicz 16**, Legal Advisor NATO Joint Force Training
Centre, "From Riga to Wales. NATO's Road to Collective Cyberdefence",
NATO Road to Cybersecurity, The Kosciuszko Institute,
https://ik.org.pl/wp-content/uploads/nato_road_to_cybersecurity_the_kosciuszko_institute_2016.pdf

[The Wales Summit Declaration]{.underline}8 was a major step forward in
acknowledging the challenges posed by complex cyberattacks. It was the
first official document in which the Member Nations of the Alliance
confirmed the possibility of a cyberattack to cross the threshold of an
armed attack and thus become the basis for invoking Article 5 of the
North Atlantic Treaty. It was reiterated that cyberthreats and attacks
would continue to become more common, sophisticated, and potentially
damaging. In Paragraph 72, the Alliance Nations declared that:

"Cyberattacks can reach a threshold that threatens national and
EuroAtlantic prosperity, security, and stability. Their impact could be
as harmful to modern societies as a conventional attack. We affirm
therefore that cyber defence is part of NATO's core task of collective
defence. A decision as to when a cyberattack would lead to the
invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on
a case-by-case basis."

[This clearly demonstrates [the Alliance's view]{.mark} whereby
cyberattacks can cross the threshold of an armed attack, allowing
individual or collective self-defence to be invocated under both Article
51 of the UN Charterand Article 5 of the North Atlantic
Treaty]{.underline}. Moreover, for the first time since NATO took on the
topic of cyberdefence in 2006, it was explicitly stated that
cyberdefence became part of the Alliance's collective defence tasks and
efforts.

[The Member Nations adopted the Enhanced Cyber Defence Policy (ECDP)
which [reaffirms]{.mark} the principles of the [**indivisibility** of
Allied security]{.mark} and of prevention, detection, resilience,
recovery, and defence and clearly states that]{.underline} "(...)[the
fundamental cyber defence responsibility of NATO is to defend its own
networks, and that assistance to Allies should be addressed in
accordance with the spirit of solidarity, [emphasizing]{.mark} the
**[responsibility]{.mark}** of Allies [to develop]{.mark} the
[**relevant capabilities** for]{.mark} the [protection]{.mark} of
national networks."]{.underline} The ECDP recognises the applicability
of international law to cyber operations, including the International
Humanitarian Law (IHL) or the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC).

[The Nations committed themselves to further develop their national
cyberdefence capabilities and enhance the cybersecurity of their
networks, upon which the Alliance depends]{.underline}. NATO's top
priority for cyberdefence is the protection of NATO-owned communications
and information systems (CIS); however, [[the Alliance will **assist**
the Nations in defending their national networks **considered critical**
for NATO's missions]{.mark}.]{.underline} For this purpose, [the
Alliance cooperates with national authorities to ensure an appropriate
level of cyberdefence of national CIS.]{.underline} Such cooperation is
being formalised in Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) signed between the
Cyber Defence Management Board and the respective nations. Cyberdefence
MOUs are based upon a template developed in the Cyber Defence Action
Plan in line with the principles of the ECDP. [They set the foundations
for mutual support in the area of cyberdefence, including
**[info]{.mark}**rmation **[sharing]{.mark}**, participation in
**[training]{.mark}** and **[exercises]{.mark}** as well as the
provision of reciprocal assistance in the form of
**[intel]{.mark}**ligence and **["manpower"]{.mark}**]{.underline} [(CIS
specialists and cyberdefence experts).]{.underline} The Czech Republic
was the first NATO Nation to sign such a MOU on 12 October 2015.9
Assistance to Allies may be provided by one of the Rapid Reaction Teams
formed by the NCIA as part of the Alliance's collective cyberdefence
capability.10

[The Wales Summit Declaration further [provided]{.mark} for a continued
[**integration** of cyberdefence into **NATO
op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}** and operational and contingency
planning, as well as the enhancement of information sharing and
situational awareness among Allies. The key role of partnerships in
addressing cyberthreats was stressed.]{.underline}

Also [the ECDP requires NATO to include cyberdefence aspects in the
**[defence planning]{.mark}** process.]{.underline} This has been
achieved by implementing respective cyberdefence annexes in Operations
Plans (OPLANs) developed for real-life operations, training and
exercises as well as contingency plans. The training and exercise
programme has grown to include cyber-specific exercises such as Cyber
Coalition and Locked Shields. In addition, an extensive cyberdefence
play has been incorporated into more "classic" training and exercises,
including the biggest NATO exercise over the last decade -- Trident
Juncture 15 and Coalition Warrior Interoperability eXploration,
eXperimentation, eXamination, eXercise (CWIX), to which the Joint Force
Training Centre has been the proud host for the last five years.11

[One of the most important aspects of the NATO ECDP is cooperation in
broad terms: with NATO Nations]{.underline} (as described above),
[Partner Nations, international actors such as the UN and the EU,
industry and academia.]{.underline} [**[Coop]{.mark}**eration [with
**industry** has been formalised]{.mark} in the NATO Industry Cyber
Partnership (NICP), which was founded and endorsed by the Alliance
**[based]{.mark}** up[**on** the conclusion]{.mark} that [NATO and
industry faced **shared risks**]{.mark} in cyberspace, and that
addressing these challenges required new frameworks for action. Within
the NICP framework, the NCIA has launched the cybersecurity incubator
concept tasked to develop a new model for NATO-industry cooperation with
the aim to decrease the time required for NATO to develop its cyber
response capabilities, based upon the results of research and
development programmes already run by industry and
academia.]{.underline}

There are many other cooperation frameworks such as the Cyber
Information and Incident Coordination System (CIIS), a web-based
application developed for sharing cyberdefence information within a
trusted community and available to all NATO Nations and Partner Nations
as well as commercial organizations.

NATO does not develop offensive cyber capabilities. Although the
Alliance focuses on defence against cyberattacks, it does not preclude
particular Member Nations from developing their own national offensive
cyber capabilities. In fact, there are nations who openly admit they
pursue such capabilities involving "(...)countering (disorganising,
jamming and destroying) the sources of threats (active defence and
offensive actions) (...)".12 As a matter of fact, NATO Rules of
Engagement13 in Series 36 (Information Operations) envisage the
possibility of conducting offensive computer network operations (namely
Computer Network Attacks -- CNAs); however, none of these offensive ROEs
have been authorised so far by the North Atlantic Council in operations
or exercises.

This short text hopefully illustrates how [NATO's approach to
cyberdefence has evolved over the last decade to culminate in a
[**clear** and **unambiguous** declaration that **cyberattacks can
trigger**]{.mark} the invocation of **[Article 5]{.mark}.** While the
Alliance is committed to assist Allies in their defence efforts, it
encourages the Member Nations to develop their own cyberdefence
capabilities in the spirit of Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty.
This evolutionary approach [should be **continued** to ensure the
**adaptation**]{.mark} of the Alliance's cyberdefence policy [to **new
trends**]{.mark} in cyber operations, [including]{.mark} the development
of response options to]{.underline} e.g.:

[1) cyber actions amounting to armed attacks;]{.underline}

[2) [the possibility of a **broader application** of cyber means]{.mark}
and methods [of war]{.mark}fare [in **future
conflicts**]{.mark};]{.underline}

[3) terrorist acts with the use of cyber means.]{.underline}

[**[Adaptability]{.mark}** and **[flexibility]{.mark}** as well as [a
**broad range of response**]{.mark} options [are a **must**]{.mark} in
the world where the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure are no
secret and neither is the reliance of countries on critical
infrastructure]{.underline} which in many cases is shared between two or
more countries.

### Link Wall\-\--Baltics

#### Baltic participation in tech innovation to counter hybrid threats drives multilateral adoption throughout Europe 

Justinas **Mickus 19**, Associate Analyst of Vilnius Institute for
Political Analysis, and Piret Kuusik, International Centre of Defence
and Security Junior Researcher, October 2019, "The Baltic Risk
Landscape,"
https://efpi.icds.ee/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2019/11/Mickus-Kuusik_The-Baltic-Risk-Landscape_October-2019.pdf

To an extent, then, the [developed [expertise]{.mark} in [combatting
cyber threats can]{.mark}]{.underline} and already has
**[[enable]{.underline}]{.mark}**d [the [Baltic]{.mark} state[**s** to
**set multilateral standards and**]{.mark} **craft [collective]{.mark}
policy [solutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the field. And yet, [with
the increasingly widespread appreciation of hybrid and next-generation
threats, the comparative advantage the Baltics have today will likely
decrease in the future. Should Baltic politicians]{.underline} wish to
[further pursue [leadership in cyber and hybrid security]{.mark}, they
[will **require further policy innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline} (a
similar note could be made about the self-declared Baltic expertise on
Russian/Eastern Neighborhood questions more broadly).

The Baltics, certainly, may also focus on other areas in which they play
a unique role and boast unique expertise. Today, individual Baltic
states have made significant inroads in developing notable expertise in
e-governance (Estonia) or fintech (Lithuania). Survey respondents from
Latvia and Estonia also demonstrate high appreciation for and diverse
understanding of the impact the rising pace of technological change is
likely have on Baltic politics. For both sets of respondents, this trend
ranks among the top three and is connected with various economic,
societal, and security risks (by contrast, increasing cyber-dependence
is primarily through the security lens).

Whether they choose [[to further develop]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[hybrid and cyber capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} or expand their
focus to different fields, the [[Baltic states stand to benefit
from]{.mark} international **[coop]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}. As
[**[continuous]{.mark} policy [innovation requires new inputs]{.mark}**,
seeking diverse [international partnerships]{.mark} can greatly
[augment]{.mark} the [policy instruments]{.mark} currently employed by
the Baltic states]{.underline}. For example, should the Baltic
governments focus on the trend of ageing population (among the experts
surveyed, it ranked as the most important trend in the Baltic region),
the could consult the expertise and experience of Japan, which has
recently developed an ambitious strategy of tackling the transformation
into a digital society for an ageing population.11

ACTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE MEMBERSHIP

Unique expertise alone is not sufficient for small states to shape the
international order with the use of postwar institutions -- there is a
difference between being a one-issue state and the leader on the issue.
[[Small states must]{.mark} **simultaneously [be]{.mark} active and
[constructive partners]{.mark}** [to other members of the core group
of]{.mark} the [postwar order]{.mark}]{.underline}. As their
institutional innovations need the assent and backing of greater powers
to have any tangible effect, [fostering stable and [productive
partnerships with key allied powers]{.mark} to secure their buy-in
[is]{.mark} a [necessary]{.mark} tactic for small states]{.underline}.

[Russia's]{.underline} illegal [annexation of]{.underline}
**[[Crimea]{.underline}]{.mark}** in March 2014 [and its military
actions in]{.underline} [Ukraine have [led]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[transatlantic policy-makers]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[reassess]{.mark} collective [defence

to as NATO's "eastern flank".]{.underline} [Extending north]{.underline}
partially beyond the "eastern flank" [is a region that comprises
eight]{.underline} Nordic and **[[Baltic states]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[which have become]{.underline} [increasingly
interdependent]{.underline} in security terms. [The region [is
of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[rising importance]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[in]{.mark} the context of Europe's changing security
order]{.underline} -- [and]{.underline} **[[defence and
deterrence]{.mark} is set to be high on the agenda]{.underline}** [at
NATO's summit meeting in Warsaw]{.underline}, Poland, in July.

[NATO has a]{.underline} **[strong role]{.underline}** [in coordinating
closer security ties]{.underline} between the region's states. Finland
and Sweden are not members of the Alliance and are therefore not covered
by NATO's collective defence clause. However, [the [Allies are]{.mark}
[working]{.mark} closely]{.underline} with both countries -- two of
NATO's most active partners -- [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[assess
security]{.mark} [in the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Baltic Sea
region]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[expand
exchanges of information]{.underline}]{.mark}, including **[[on hybrid
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**, coordinating training and exercises,
[and to]{.underline} **[[develop better]{.mark} [joint situational
awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[The prospects are positive for]{.underline} [improved]{.underline}
NATO-Nordic-[Baltic defence cooperation]{.underline}, yet a number of
important challenges need to be overcome. [The [region will
test]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[NATO's flexibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[in strengthening defence ties]{.underline} among its members and
crucial partner states.

#### Bolstering hybrid response in the Baltics is the [first step]{.underline} towards broader NATO/EU adoption

Andrew **Radin 17**, political scientist at the RAND Corporation, 2017,
"Hybrid Warfare in the Baltics: Threats and Potential Responses,"
https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1500/RR1577/RAND_RR1577.pdf

[[Improving]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[response to]{.underline}]{.mark}
potential [[Russian covert action can be]{.mark} thought of in [three
phases]{.mark}: detecting and [attributing Russian
action]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[strengthening]{.underline}**]{.mark}
the [[**capacity of the Baltics to respond**, and **formulating an
effective**]{.mark} **and appropriate [EU and NATO
response]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Better intelligence gathering and coordination and a clearer
understanding of the signs of Russian covert aggression can help bolster
defenses against active subversion. U.S. Air Force assets, such as
unmanned aerial vehicles and ground-based radars, could be beneficial at
filling gaps in these countries' existing intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance capabilities, both for covert action and conventional
warfare.7 [[NATO is]{.underline}]{.mark} also currently
[[undertaking]{.mark} several [initiatives to improve
**intel**]{.mark}ligence [and coordination]{.mark} related [to Russian
covert action]{.mark}]{.underline}, including developing shared
indicators and warnings, NATO Force Integration Units (NFIUs), and
combined exercises. Although NATO has made progress in developing
institutions for intelligence sharing, NATO's structures and processes
for intelligence sharing remain cumbersome and dependent on
often-reluctant nations to share.8 Given NATO's slow progress in this
area, [further [developing bilateral]{.mark} intelligence [sharing
between]{.mark} the [Baltic countries and]{.mark}]{.underline} the
United States or [[other NATO countries could be
valuable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Additional research could also contribute
by identifying the signs and mechanisms of past instances of large-scale
Russian covert activities in Georgia, Crimea, and eastern Ukraine. So
far, there is little open source information about how to differentiate
between "everyday" Russian exercises and influence operations and the
start of a large-scale campaign mirroring the operation in Crimea. More
clearly identifying the modus operandi of Russian agents would help to
separate out the cases that justify a NATO deployment and those that
might not.

The capacity of the Baltic countries to counter covert action can
certainly be improved. U.S. special operations forces have conducted
extensive engagement with their Baltic counterparts, to the point that
there is a sense of saturation, especially given the small size of the
Baltic special operations forces. Additional research may be beneficial
to help identify gaps in the Baltic countries' capacity, including
within civilian agencies, and to conduct targeted missions that could
offer more focused benefits. Support for the Baltic states to counter
covert action may also strengthen their ability to resist Russia in the
event of an invasion.9 The U.S. Air Force may be able to directly assist
with the development of technical capabilities for border control, air
and maritime domain awareness, and intelligence gathering, including
assistance with acquiring unmanned aerial vehicles, radars, and other
sensors. Another specific area where the United States may be able to
offer assistance is in planning exercises and war games to improve
contingency planning and coordination, especially in Latvia.

Finally, the United States, [[NATO, and the Baltic countries can do
more]{.mark} to think practically through how a response to Russian
covert action would proceed]{.underline}. The 2014 Wales Summit focused
on the development of greater "responsiveness" through the Readiness
Action Plan and the creation of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force
(VJTF). However, it remains uncertain how these new, more responsive
forces would be employed if there was warning of a significant Russian
covert (or conventional) military action in the Baltics.10 While the
development of the VJTF and implementation of the Readiness Action Plan
is complex and will take time, [[it is highly beneficial for]{.mark} the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and other [NATO allies
to think through]{.mark} on a practical level [how]{.mark} a
[high-readiness forces would deploy]{.mark} and be employed [in the
Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}, and how they would coordinate its actions
with the Baltic security forces.

need to [work at the **speed of relevance** rather than the **speed of
approval**. This means **new**]{.mark} ways of **[financing]{.mark}**
technologies, interacting with tech firms both big and small, and much
more [**agile acquisition**]{.mark} models, [which carry]{.mark} the
empowerment and [**incentives** to]{.mark} those responsible for
**[equip]{.mark}**ping **[the Alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Such a
cultural shift will not be easy -- but innovation rarely is.

[As we look towards NATO 2030]{.underline} and heed Eisenhower's words
of achieving both security and solvency, while noting that the
foundation of military strength is economic strength, [[a **resilient
innovation pipeline** that leverages our **comparative advantage**,
**creativity** and **capital** will be **critical** to]{.mark} the
Alliance [maintaining]{.mark} its **[tech]{.mark}**nological [**edge**
built on **shared Allied values.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Innovation IL\-\--NATO-Led Key

#### NATO is key to innovation\-\--fragmenting efforts won't means we lose the tech edge to competitors

#### NATO focus has a stronger effect on innovation priorities

[But before we get to commercialisation, we need to create the direction
of what it is we wish to see commercialised. Technological disruptive
[innovation]{.mark} does not just happen. It [starts with a
**mission-oriented vision**, where **measuring risk** is impossible
and]{.mark} only [**uncertainty** reigns. It requires **bold moves**
that will **signpost the future**; the **confidence** to place **big
bets** on tech]{.mark}nology [not yet invented; and an ability to **pick
winners**]{.mark} -- all of [which must be underpinned by **persistent
engagement**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} encouragement and
enlightenment. Since the end of the Second World War, only one entity
has taken-on such uncertainty: Allied governments (see image below).

Step 1: agree innovation priorities among Allies

[[The **first step** towards **fixing**]{.mark} the
**[fragmentation]{.mark}** of Allied disruptive innovation [is for
Allies, through the **NATO framework**, to focus on **agreed innovation
priorities**.]{.mark} This will allow them to pick winners and invest
public patient capital]{.underline} -- the private sector is unlikely to
invest venture capital as the risk is simply too high (nations tend not
to go out of business and can take on such uncertainty). [This
[**direction** and **investment** will]{.mark} help to [maintain
NATO's]{.mark} overarching **[tech]{.mark}**nological
**[edge]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Indeed, as Keynes and Weber argued, [the
ability to make things happen that otherwise would not needs a
combination of technological, policy and bureaucratic skills matched by
investment]{.underline}

#### Networking is key to maximize innovation

https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2020/09/01/building-a-resilient-innovation-pipeline-for-the-alliance/

Step 2: leverage the comparative advantage of the Alliance

[If Allies are [to achieve most defence at less cost with least
delay]{.mark} built with wisdom and efficiency, then it is logical to
[leverage]{.mark} those natural [advantages that **geography** and
**skill sets** afford]{.mark} NATO **[member]{.mark}**
state**[s]{.mark}**. [A **network** of the finest universities]{.mark}
across the Alliance [should be established and resourced to allow
**cutting-edge multinational research** to take place across **multiple
disruptive tech**]{.mark}nologies **[simultaneously]{.mark}**. Perhaps
Stanford could lead on relevant AI research, while Delft and the
University of Chicago partner on quantum; maybe Imperial College London
looks at biotechnologies with Johns Hopkins University, while Tallinn
University centres its efforts on next generation cyber defences; and
the École Polytechnique and Massachusetts Institute of Technology
examine future telecommunication needs.]{.underline}

The point is [[**Allies** will need to leverage such networks]{.mark} of
universities [in **conjunction** with]{.mark} national
**[government]{.mark}** research [labs to provide **maximum innovation
coherence**.]{.mark} The [**diversity** of]{.mark} multinational,
multi-disciplined defence and security innovation [research
teams]{.mark}, which NATO can engender, [is a **huge asset** and]{.mark}
is [the Alliance's **competitive advantage**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Utilise, adopt and scale

[Where the first stage of NATO's innovation pipeline should centre on
the creation of disruptive innovative technologies, stage two is all
about their [**utilisation** and **adoption at
scale.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Utilisation

[This [is where]{.mark} initial **[public]{.mark}** venture capital
(**[VC]{.mark}**) entities]{.underline}, such as in-q-tel, NSSIF,
DefInvest and SmartCap, [[can]{.mark} help **['crowd in']{.mark}**
trusted **[private v]{.mark}**enture **[c]{.mark}**apital [to provide
**safe financing**]{.mark} to NATO's fledgling start-ups, thereby
[minimising]{.mark} their [susceptibility to **nefarious
f**]{.mark}oreign **[d]{.mark}**irect **[i]{.mark}**nvestment. This
issue is [impacting]{.mark} many [start-ups]{.mark} as they raise funds
and carries implications [when they wish to **export**]{.mark} their
products [but may not]{.mark} be able to, [due to **unfriendly foreign
ownership** and **tech**]{.mark}nology [**transfer** concerns]{.mark}
raised by Allied governments.]{.underline}

In addition to Venture Capital entities supporting the trusted financing
of Allied start-ups, **[[innovation accelerators]{.underline}]{.mark}**
-- in combination with elite universities, and [[supported by **Allied
defence professionals**]{.underline}]{.mark} (operators, investors and
procurement experts) -- [[can]{.mark} help [provide the **necessary
'polish'**]{.mark} to start-ups and their value propositions. This will
create the necessary ecosystem [to **maximise**]{.mark} the
[**likelihood** of **commercial success**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
United States' Air Force Ventures is an interesting model of this
approach, which helps to acquire new start-up products at speed without
being bogged down by acquisition bureaucracy.

#### Startups need NATO to get off the ground

Rob **Murray 20**, head of the Innovation Unit in NATO's Emerging
Security Challenges Division, MSc, ISR Management, University of
Lincoln, MBA, The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, MA,
International Policy and Diplomacy, Staffordshire University, 9/1/20,
\"Building a resilient innovation pipeline for the Alliance\", NATO
Review,
https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2020/09/01/building-a-resilient-innovation-pipeline-for-the-alliance/

Adoption

But even when dual-use disruptive innovation is commercialised, turned
into prototypes and the product/market fit is achieved, [the challenge
of getting initial contracts from customers]{.underline} (both
government and commercial) remains. [Cash is king for **[young
companies]{.mark}**, as they [do not have]{.mark} the [**financial
reserves** to work through **long acquisition processes**]{.mark} often
[associated with **Allied governments**]{.mark}. If start-ups cannot
close deals in a matter of weeks and months rather than quarters and
years, then they would not attempt to (opportunity cost).]{.underline}

Now, some commentators may argue: Why spend so much time discussing
start-ups? Traditional large armaments companies can be innovative. Why
go through all this effort for tiny companies that may or may not make
it?

The reason is simple: [the competition and creativity generated by
**[start-ups]{.mark}** is good for the **Allied defence ecosystem**.
Allied open democracies and open educational models bring about levels
of creativity which other forms of government are unable to do. This
[**maximises**]{.mark} disruptive [innovation]{.mark} efforts and, as
such, [forces incumbents]{.mark} (large companies) [to
**compete**]{.mark} with new, fresh thinking -- it [builds
**resilience**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Such [**creativity** and **disruption** is **NATO's competitive
advantage**]{.mark}. Therefore, [NATO needs to]{.mark} adapt its
acquisition models to [accommodate start-ups,]{.mark} their timelines
and their potential. This fundamentally means our acquisition
professionals should be empowered to take measurable risk]{.underline}.
As one Ally's legislative body recently remarked: "[[Defence
stakeholders must **integrate the risk culture**]{.mark}, which is [the
**only way** to both **enable innovation**]{.mark} in defence and to
very quickly capture dual or civilian innovation. Acculturation to
innovation is a priority]{.underline}."

Scaling

[If we have managed to commercialise new technology, adopt it quickly as
a prototype and now wish to scale, how might this be done? Big tech
could have a role to play here]{.underline}. In May, it was reported
that, in the first quarter of 2020, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet
and Microsoft spent over 29 billion US dollars on research and
development (R&D). That is more than the entire 2020 NASA budget and
represents a 17 per cent increase on the same time period last year.

In November 2018, the US Congressional Research Service noted: "In 1960,
the United States accounted for 69% of global R&D, with U.S.
defense-related R&D alone accounting for more than one-third of global
R&D (36%). Additionally, the federal government funded approximately
twice as much R&D as U.S. business. However, from 1960 to 2016, the U.S.
share of global R&D fell to 28%, and the federal government's share of
total U.S. R&D fell from 65% to 24%, while business's share more than
doubled from 33% to 67%. As a result of these global, national, and
federal trends, federal defense R&D's share of total global R&D fell to
3.7% in 2016."

[[**Big tech** has the **resources** and **wherewithal**]{.mark} to be
able [to **scale new tech**]{.mark}nologies [at **speed**. They
could]{.mark} partner with successful start-ups, perhaps
[through]{.mark} a joint venture or [an **Alliance-wide
p**]{.mark}ublic-**[p]{.mark}**rivate **[p]{.mark}**artnership, to
[provide]{.mark} those [scale-up skills that start-ups lack]{.mark} (for
example, [compliance, legal support, production on mass,
i]{.mark}ntellectual [p]{.mark}roperty [protection]{.mark})]{.underline}
without necessarily acquiring these young companies.

### Innovation IL\-\--AT: Gov Innovation Fails

#### Gov innovation works

As the image above shows, [[governments have **done this

(**[internet]{.mark}**, **[GPS]{.mark}**, **[touchscreen]{.mark}** et
al, which fed into the building of the iPod and [**iPhone**) have had a

all those successes, there]{.mark} will [have been many
**failures**]{.mark} and **[this is where Allies will need to get

defence innovator: ["[if]{.mark} our [success rate]{.mark} begins to [go

stopped taking big enough risks**]{.mark}."]{.underline} Indeed,
[obvious research areas Allies might collaborate on include the

[[In aggregate, the Alliance has an abundance of world-class academic
institutions]{.mark}, the finest scientific [researchers]{.mark},
amazingly creative [start-ups]{.mark} and a mature [well-resourced
financial eco-system]{.mark}.]{.underline} These constitute [[the core
ingredients]{.mark}, which, [when combined and focused, can
solve]{.mark} dual-use, ['tough-tech' problems]{.mark}]{.underline} --
that is, challenges facing both defence and non-defence sectors, such as
augmented reality and quantum computing.

#### Yes incentive

https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2020/09/01/building-a-resilient-innovation-pipeline-for-the-alliance/

[[A dual-use model is important]{.mark} for disruptive defence
innovation because when we eventually get to commercialising such
tough-tech breakthroughs, Allies will need start-ups and tech firms [to
maximise]{.mark} the [reach of]{.mark} their [products]{.mark} by
looking at 'total addressable problems' rather than 'total addressable
markets'.]{.underline} In other words, we should not want start-ups
building the next wave of technology to have governments as their only
customer. We want such technologies to benefit society too and therefore
have civil, commercial use. Such [[commercial use]{.underline}]{.mark}
then [[drives]{.underline}]{.mark} the [subsequent [development]{.mark}
of said technology, pulling the government-side along with it, [which
means better products]{.mark} and technology all round -- building
defence with wisdom and efficiency.]{.underline}

Indeed, [[dual-use potential will]{.mark} help [align]{.mark} the
[incentives]{.mark} of our researchers, entrepreneurs and finance
communities [as]{.mark} the [prospective commercial upside]{.mark}
(problem) [will be big enough for them to undertake]{.mark} the
[investment]{.mark} of commercialisation. [The geopolitical
advantage]{.mark} such disruptive innovation fosters (picking winners
via big bets on the next breakthrough) [will]{.mark} also [be large
enough]{.mark} to allow [for]{.mark} its [creation via early
stage]{.mark} patient [public]{.mark} sector capital
[investment]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Innovation IL\-\--Commitment Key

#### Commitment generates urgency\-\--motivation gaps risk military failure

the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD Center) of the National
Defense University in Washington, DC, ""Innovating" Versus

Second, [**[we need a sense of urgency]{.mark}** and the means to
accurately assess what others are doing. [Russia and China are committed
to developing **leading-edge military tech**]{.mark}nologies and
fielding "high-tech forces"]{.underline} in part [because they see U.S.
dominance as an existential threat. [They are **highly motivated**. It
is **not clear** the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [is]{.mark}
as sharply motivated, [which creates]{.mark} the potential for
[a]{.mark} focus or [**commitment gap**. Closing]{.mark} any [such gap
is something leadership should pay attention to; otherwise it may take a
**crisis** or a **military failure** to generate the necessary sense of
urgency]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Innovation IL\-\--Integration Key

#### Integration is key\-\--we need to incorporate all elements of innovation to outcompete great powers 

Paul **Bernstein 19**, a distinguished research fellow at the Center for
the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD Center) of the National
Defense University in Washington, DC, ""Innovating" Versus
"Out-Innovating": Innovation as a Form of Strategic Competition",
Getting Innovation Right, Center for Global Security Research, Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, Sept 2019,
https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1635772

Third, [[we need an **integrated**]{.mark} approach. A [**dynamic**
approach to **innovating**]{.mark} for operational [advantage requires
taking account of **all forms** of innovation, determining the
**appropriate mix** for the **types of conflicts**]{.mark} the armed
[forces are likely to engage in]{.mark} and the specific operational
challenges they will need to overcome. [Innovation encompasses]{.mark}
not only **[tech]{.mark}**nology but also operational [**concepts**
and]{.mark} organization/ **[process]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Military
innovation and transformation leaders have long argued against an
overemphasis on technology at the expense of other factors. Typically it
is some combination of technology, concepts, and organization that
provides a basis for breakthroughs. Often we are reminded of this when
an adversary demonstrates it.

High-end regional war is generally the default lens through which we
view requirements for innovation and it may be true that the bulk of
defense innovation will be directed at this problem. But [[the
**spectrum of conflict**]{.mark} also [includes **hybrid
warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline} (a mix of regular and irregular armed
conflict) [and coercive activities short of armed conflict ("political
warfare")]{.underline}---modes of conflict that are not entirely new,
but whose contemporary manifestations are indeed novel and for which the
United States generally seems poorly prepared. [[We **cannot
dismiss**]{.mark} the requirements for [innovation in these aspects of
**great power competition**]{.mark}, not least because [they may lead us
down pathways]{.mark} much [different from]{.mark} those shaped by the
demands of [highend]{.mark} regional [war]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The following matrix may be useful as a very simple way to visualize the
"battlespace" for innovation.

It is worth noting here that political warfare may be somewhat anomalous
when considered as an arena of great power competition. In this domain,
[[the goal of the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark}
its **[partners]{.mark}** is]{.underline} not to out-innovate
adversaries so as to build the more advanced toolkit for political
subversion, social division, economic warfare, and coercion. Rather, the
West's goal is [to greatly [improve the ability of liberal states to
**reduce**]{.mark} their **[vulnerability]{.mark}** to such strategies
[and]{.mark} actively **[resist]{.mark}** them.]{.underline} This is a
somewhat different context for innovation, but an important one given
the strategic stakes.

### Innovation Impact\-\--China AI

#### China AI competition escalates

Calum **Chace 20**, co-founder of the Economic Singularity Foundation,
global keynote speaker about AI, MBA, Cranfield University, 6/30/20,
\"Thucydides And The Dragon: Artificial Intelligence And Sino-US
Rivalry\", Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/calumchace/2020/06/30/thucydides-and-the-dragon-artificial-intelligence-and-sino-us-rivalry/#1c7a93d94fc1

From Cold War to Code War?

[[The **most dangerous**]{.mark} source of [**conflict** could
be]{.mark} **China**'s determination to catch up with and then surpass
America as the leading developer of **AI**, our most powerful
technology]{.underline}. Some fear that [the Cold War between the two
nuclear superpowers could be followed by [a **Code War** between]{.mark}
its [**two AI superpowers**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Taiwanese venture capitalist Kai-Fu Lee, a former Google and Apple
executive, argues that China will overhaul the US in AI because it has
more hard-working and aggressive entrepreneurs and researchers, and also
because it has a disregard for privacy which allows its researchers to
amass more data. ["If data is the new oil, China is the new Saudi
Arabia",]{.underline} as one critic put it.

It is true that the 9-9-6 work ethic (72 hours a week) makes Chinese
startup scene a highly competitive one. Many Chinese students no longer
want to stay in the US when they finish their degrees in computer
science. They are keen to return home and get rich there.

Do Chinese people care about privacy?

It is also true that China's attitude to privacy distinguishes it from
the US, and even more from Europe. The Social Credit system being
pioneered today has the potential to become a level of government
surveillance that would make Big Brother jealous. This is happening
partly because the communist party wills it so, and resistance is pretty
much impossible for most citizens. It is also partly because corruption
is endemic and severe in China, and levels of trust outside family
networks are low. A system which punishes anti-social behaviour swiftly
and effectively is less resisted in China than it would be elsewhere.

But we should not over-state the extent to which being oblivious to
privacy issues is a killer app. China watcher JJ Ding argues that
Chinese people do care about privacy, and that the government knows it
cannot take their acceptance for granted. [The US tech giants still have
a significant lead in technology and expertise, and they still have
momentum. AI is increasingly a duopoly between China and the US, not an
emerging Chinese hegemony.]{.underline}

The US managed to avoid the utter disaster of full-scale military
confrontation with the Soviet Union, and in many ways its relations with
China are much closer, which should make confrontation less dangerous.
The US economy is less open than those of most developed countries --
trade accounts for 27% of US GDP, compared to 61% for the UK, and 33%
for China. But the US and Chinese economies are far more entwined than
America's ever was with the Soviet Union. GM sells more cars in China
than in the USA and Canada combined, and Apple, Qualcomm and most other
large US companies are similarly exposed.

[Avoiding the splinternet: a role for Europe]{.underline}

Trump's populist attacks on Huawei won't kill it, although they could
certainly curb its growth, and perhaps shrink it for a while. In the
longer run they could easily have the perverse effect of damaging the US
tech sector: [[China may decide]{.mark} that [America is]{.mark} an
inherently **[untrustworthy]{.mark}** partner, and make the very heavy
investments of time and treasure required to wean itself off US
suppliers, and build its own chip industry]{.underline}, for instance.
[They could [lead to **"the splinternet"**]{.mark}**,** a
[fracturing]{.mark} of [the]{.mark} world's [tech]{.mark}nology
[ecosystem]{.mark} into two distinct communities, [which]{.mark} would
[make **global co-op**]{.mark}eration [harder]{.mark}, and
[provoke]{.mark} mutual [**fear**]{.mark} and suspicion.]{.underline}

[[**War**]{.mark} between China and the US (or NATO) [is the
worst]{.mark} possible [outcome]{.mark}, but at this stage it still
looks unlikely. [Both]{.mark} the US and Chinese [governments must walk
a tightrope between]{.mark} pursuing their legitimate grievances on the
one hand, and **[provoking]{.mark}** outright [**hostility** and
**communications breakdown**]{.mark} on the other.]{.underline} This
requires wisdom and diplomatic skills which are not prominently on
display in both Beijing and Washington at the moment.

[[It would help if there were **three AI superpowers**]{.mark}, not just
two]{.underline}. AI is not a race, as there is no finish line, and
unless the internet splinters completely, the advances made by any party
help everyone. [[But at the moment, **Europe** is barely involved.
**That ought to change**]{.mark}, and soon.]{.underline}

### Innovation Impact\-\--China Quantum

#### China quantum competition escalates

Arthur **Herman 19**, director of the Hudson Institute\'s Quantum
Alliance Initiative, 11/10/19, \"The Quantum Computing Threat to
American Security\", Wall Street Journal,
https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-quantum-computing-threat-to-american-security-11573411715

Google announced last month that it had achieved **[[\"quantum
supremacy,\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** demonstrating the potential of [a
new kind of computer that can perform certain tasks many orders of
magnitude faster than the most advanced supercomputers.]{.underline}
It\'s [a [**crucial**]{.mark} moment [for **America\'s national
security**, which depends on **winning the race** to]{.mark} do what
quantum computers will do best: [decrypt]{.mark} the vast majority of
existing [public]{.mark}-key encryption [systems]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Google reports that its quantum computer, dubbed Sycamore, solved a
mathematical calculation in 200 seconds that would take a supercomputer
10,000 years. IBM, a quantum competitor, asserted that Google\'s claim
of supremacy is overblown, and that the world\'s most powerful classical
computer, the Summit OLCF-4 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, could have
done the same calculation in 2.5 days---roughly a thousandfold
difference rather than 1.5 trillionfold. Still, [[quantum
computers]{.mark} are no longer science fiction.]{.underline}

To process information, digital computers use bits, essentially switches
that can be either off or on, corresponding with the binary digits, 0
and 1. Quantum computers employ \"qubits,\" which use the probabilistic
nature of quantum physics to represent any combination of 0 and 1
simultaneously, enabling them to encode more complicated data.

Their computing power grows exponentially as the number of qubits
expands. Sycamore\'s 54-qubit chip allowed it to outcompute the best
supercomputer. [A 2,000- to 4,000-qubit quantum computer [would render
most]{.mark} public-key **[encryption]{.mark}** architectures---used for
applications [from **banking**]{.mark} and credit cards [to the]{.mark}
power [**grid**---**obsolete**]{.mark}.]{.underline} They rely on
numbers too big for conventional computers to factorize, but which a
quantum computer could.

[Building quantum computers is a very heavy lift.]{.underline} They
require hugely expensive infrastructure to stabilize the qubits at
temperatures near absolute zero. They also generate high error rates, or
\"quantum noise,\" for which researchers have to compensate. [Developers
are probably years away from the large-scale code-breaking quantum
computer everyone worries about---although once scientists and engineers
start using quantum computers to build the next generation of quantum
computers]{.underline} (since modeling complex systems like themselves
is one of their strengths) [the timeline could quickly
shorten.]{.underline}

[[Beijing]{.mark} is America\'s chief quantum-computing
rival]{.underline}. It spends at least \$2.5 billion a year on
research---more than 10 times what Washington spends---and has a massive
quantum center in Hefei province. [China [aspires to develop the]{.mark}
code-breaking [**\"killer app,\"**]{.mark} which means
[**protecting**]{.mark} U.S. data and networks [from **quantum
intrusion** is]{.mark} a **[vital]{.mark}** security
interest.]{.underline}

Congress enacted the National Quantum Initiative Act late last year,
which commits an additional \$1.25 billion over five years---still a
fraction of China\'s effort. In addition to more money, [the U.S.
needs]{.underline} a three-phase national-security strategy [to protect
and defend American data, networks and infrastructure from future
quantum attack.]{.underline}

First, dramatically increase efforts to develop encryption methods based
on algorithms large and complex enough to foil quantum intrusion. The
National Institute of Standards and Technology is working to set a
comprehensive standard for these quantum-resistant algorithms so they
can be deployed by 2024, but companies in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere
are already building algorithms and other protective tools.

Second, use quantum technology itself to create the \"unhackable\"
networks of the future. The same particles that make quantum computing
possible can provide randomized and unhackable keys for encrypted
transmissions, in the form of quantum random number generators and
quantum key distribution, a method of securing information shared
between two parties. Dismissed as a fantasy a few years ago, quantum
cryptography has spawned companies in the U.S., Switzerland, South Korea
and Australia, which are deploying the first components of a new
quantum-based information-technology infrastructure. Eventually this
will include satellites using quantum keys to transmit encrypted data.

Here again China has moved quickly. It launched the world\'s first
quantum satellite in 2016 and shocked the world by creating a
quantum-encrypted intercontinental video link from space to a
China-Austria study group in Vienna. China has also created a 1,263-mile
ground link between Beijing and Shanghai using quantum-encrypted keys
between relay stations, which offers an ultrasecure network for
transmitting sensitive data, including for China\'s military and
intelligence services.

Third, require that all U.S. data and networks, including future 5G
technology, be made secure from quantum attack while devoting resources
to build [the [**hack-proof** quantum]{.mark} communication
[networks]{.mark} of the future]{.underline}. That [will [**require**
working with]{.mark} America\'s closest **[allies]{.mark}**, several of
which are [making **key breakthroughs**]{.mark} in the same quantum and
postquantum technologies.]{.underline}

[Promoting such cooperation]{.underline} has been a core mission at the
Quantum Alliance Initiative, which convened a consortium of companies
and universities from [the U.S. and allied countries to [develop
**global standards**]{.mark} for quantum random number generators and
quantum key distribution]{.underline} late last year. [But [no one can
do]{.mark} all [this alone]{.mark}]{.underline}, not even Google plus
IBM plus Microsoft and the other big companies working in quantum
computing. Leadership from the federal government is more imperative
than ever. Google\'s breakthrough proves that [the threats, as well as
the opportunities, of quantum technology are real---and that
[**quantum** is]{.mark} poised to become **[the national-security issue
