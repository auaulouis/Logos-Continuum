### Data

#### Data-collection in service of security sorts feminine subjects into the category of victim which objectifies them and denies them agency

In these sections I trace in my interview data a formal logic of
masculinist protection and a corresponding linking of the feminine to an
uncertain and hard-to-articulate sense of insecurity. Arguably,
"\[p\]lacing people at the centre of an exploration of peace politics
prompts the question ... of what work gender was (and is) doing in these
sites, given that all social practices operate in and through logics of
gender" (Shepherd 2014, 103). [Throughout, it becomes clear that "the
gendered body in need of securing is female" (McLeod 2015, 59). Yet it
also surfaces that international actors are implicated in the creation
of the need to secure, both in terms of the need to secure the foreign
female self, and Afghan women (Fluri 2009, 2011).]{.underline} When
speaking about the interactions between protection and gender in an
Afghan peacebuilding context, my respondents' opinions, experiences and
perceptions were marked by hybridity, victories and setbacks, change
understood as positive and negative, power and agency playing out in
unusual ways. [Protection held complex connotations linked to the
(in)security of women. For example, Kate pointed out that dominant
narratives that coded women as inherently insecure victims with the
intention of protecting them were unhelpful:]{.underline} \[Y\]ou find
people mobilizing the discourses of women as passive victims of war and
conflict, of women as naturally peaceful. And even though people want to
mobilize that discourse to assist women in participating in peace, I
think it actually recreates the stereotype about women which I don't
think is particularly useful.5 Sally provided an interesting example of
this kind of mobilization: she discussed with great optimism a project
that blended innovative crowd-mapping technologies and the reporting of
gender-based violence, illustrating a problematic engagement between
liberal peace processes and gender-based insecurities: \[T\]he aim of
this project was to enhance the use of innovative tools in reporting
about violations of women's rights ... in the form of a map. ... You can
basically record it by type of the case: rape, kidnapping, stuff like
that. Everything what you need, and then you can have access to this
data in the visual way, so you can use it for better mediation, or
approaching donors, or media \[sic\]. [Here, a globally available
data-visualization tool, the Ushahidi platform, is used to reinscribe
localized gender insecurities onto a technologically advanced, easily
measurable and easily categorized template.]{.underline} This is done so
that information can be ordered in the format best suited to donor and
media requirements. [Yet it can be read as a means of technocratic
governance (MacGinty 2012) in which a liberal order subsumes individual
abuses within an overarching perspective on gender insecurity that is
simplistically sorted, and subject to gendered and racialized logics of
identity and expected behaviors: violent/victim-based or
protector/protected (Grove 2015).]{.underline} This well-intentioned
project was ostensibly designed to try to protect women from insecurity
and violence. [However, its manifestation echoes Kate's frustration with
dominant narratives about women and her understanding of the ubiquitous
stereotyping of Afghan women as victims in order to offer them
protection (and the Othering of Afghan men as perpetrators), which
undermined their relationship to action and agency, constituting a
different kind of insecurity]{.underline}. Kate summed this up by
saying, "that idea of the victim Afghan woman -- that actually persists
even now, so yeah I don't know how much it has changed." Tela discussed
the negative implications of certain kinds of masculinist protection in
Afghan society very directly based on her perception and experience:
That protection is really a sort of indicator of the patriarchy that is
going on in this society, and we girls, women, daughters, wives, we are
considered as the savior of family's name ... a woman if she works, if
she studies, something wrong happens to her or she for example makes a
mistake then it is all, like -- the family loses honor, and the family's
man is mandated to actually do something to protect that honor. So
that's why when they say that we are protecting our girls, we're
protecting our honor. And that protection is actually encircling her, so
that she is not able to move anywhere, she's not able to speak out. ...
And that's what they think protection is all about in this society,
because it's really -- I think it's caging rather than protection -- so
that she is caged, she is shamed, she is not able to make a decision,
whoever she wants to marry she has no right to even say. It is us the
family who will decide whom she will marry, what she will do, where she
will live. So this whole notion of protection is actually caging her,
chaining her, because there is this understanding if a woman is free she
will be immoral. [A logic of masculinist protection threads through
Tela's account, one that leads to a construction of men as protectors
and women as "protected" to the detriment of their freedom and
security]{.underline}. The way that Tela speaks about "this society"
transcends the particulars of individual actions and relationship
dynamics. She is speaking in concrete terms but also making reference to
a broader sense of a patriarchal climate, an affective climate
sedimented over time, in which protection logics prescribe and delineate
possibilities, choices and meanings. Carlo echoes this as well, speaking
about his perception of how protection operates in an Afghan context: I
don't think they can go back to Taliban period, never, but there is
still a very traditional way of thinking about women. Women are the
object of the honor of these men but they are not, yeah it is an
abstract way of thinking about honor. So if you look at a woman -- if
another man look at your woman -- it is not an honorable thing, if mmm,
the woman not behave according to the strict traditions -- Islamic law
-- it is not good \[sic\]. But it is really more abstract than that,
they do it because they're used to doing it. [The way that Carlo
presents the logic of masculinist protection here, as abstract and
habitual, can be read as an affective force, one in which women are
automatically in need of protection by a masculine entity]{.underline}.
At another point in the interview, Carlo discussed what he understood to
be the vulnerability of foreign women in Afghanistan, linking this to
his own capacity as a man to protect women he accompanied in public,
allowing them more \[but still limited\] freedom of mobility: I have a
lot of friends in the international community, and of course girls here,
women here, are much more restricted; I can go out in the street and I
can do things that they couldn't think to do. They go sometimes around
with me, but there is still a restriction. [While these gendered
contexts and restrictions in the experience of Afghan and international
women cannot be equated, taken together they point to an almost
precognitive disposition (in that it is not understood as being gendered
in any deep sense, just simply natural) in Carlo and more generally to
regard international women as in need of masculinist protection, and to
perceive a somewhat similar (though not the same) logic operating
habitually in the Afghan context. Equally, in the project Sally
discussed and the frustration with dominant discourses articulated by
Kate, fragments of power hierarchies cut through the meaning of gender,
rendering the female state a disempowering one, always referencing it in
some uncertain, hybrid way as protected or in need of
protection]{.underline}. Discourses and understandings in which women
are automatically assigned victim status (and men assumed violent, etc.)
are not uncommon in many contexts and institutional frameworks (McLeod
2015). However, in Afghanistan these were arguably shaped by a very
specific affective environment -- hybridized and bounded by masculinist
protection of different kinds.

CRISES." The Routledge Handbook of Feminist Economics. Pp 361-365. LJS

However, improving gender representation, regulating credit or even
reducing inequality would not make the economy fully crisis resistant.
[Instead feminist economists are calling for a more fundamental
reorientation of economic policy goals away from growth, measured by GDP
or shareholder value, in favor of a more people-centered approach to
economic management]{.underline}. For some this reorientation involves,
following Sen (1985), enhancing the capabilities of all citizens (Fukuda
Parr, Heintz, and Seguino 2013) while others call for a Polanyian
conception of embedding the market within the society, so that finance
and production would serve the needs of the social reproduction sphere
rather than vice versa (Elson 2014). Gender and crisis policies [A
second issue of concern to feminist economists is how the state responds
to economic crises. In the Keynesian demand management era, the expected
response of the state to downturns was countercyclical expansionary
fiscal or monetary policy]{.underline}. Keynes argued that even using
public employment to dig holes in the road and fill them in again would
be beneficial. [Unfortunately, this construction example appears to have
become fixed in policymakers' minds, for even if most seek to build new
infrastructure rather than simply dig holes, their expansionary
investment projects almost always focus on physical infrastructure that
favors male-dominated sectors]{.underline}. This approach has been
challenged by, for example, the UK's Women's Budget Group (WBG) that
produced Plan F as an alternative approach to promoting growth (WBG
2015), demonstrating that by investing in the care industries instead of
construction approximately twice as many jobs would be generated. This
approach is feminist as it focuses not only on a sector where most
employees are women but also on one that supports the social
reproduction sphere, the neglected side of the economy. A related
approach was adopted by the Foundation for European Progressive Studies
through its "pink" new deal campaign to promote gender equality,
including investments in social infrastructure (Corsi 2014).
Furthermore, a major report on care by the ILO (ILO 2018) showed that
investment in the care economy could be a major source of new jobs
worldwide. Thus, one contribution of feminist economics has been to
expand the options available for countercyclical investment policies.
[However, even more problems of gender bias emerged when the
macroeconomic focus changed from how to expand the economy to how to
reduce public expenditure and deregulate economies.]{.underline} This
anti-Keynesian twist emerged first in the 1980s following the Latin
American crisis and again in the Asian financial crisis of the late
1990s (Elson 2014). In return for the IMF loans needed to survive the
crisis, the most affected countries had to agree to implement SAPs and
reign in public expenditure. However, as pointed out in Elson's (1991)
well-known gender critique, these policies did not consider the impact
on social reproduction. [The implicit assumption was that any cuts in
public service provision---including, for example, failure to maintain
water supplies---would be resolved through more unpaid labor on women's
part (e.g., walking further to fetch water). This uncosted increase in
unpaid labor for women also came on top of pressure to increase their
wage work to compensate for reduced men's earnings in the
crisis]{.underline}. This critique of SAPs, however, failed to influence
responses to the global financial crisis of 2008, particularly after it
was converted from 2010 onwards into a sovereign debt crisis. [Countries
were pressurized to implement austerity policies, a new term for
SAPs]{.underline}. The extent by which the financial crisis morphed into
a sovereign debt crisis varied by country as did the mechanisms by which
private debt was converted into public debt (Karamessini 2013). Where
banks were bailed out by taxpayers, public expenditure cuts were
implemented to offset the higher debt levels, thereby passing much of
the burden onto those most dependent on public expenditure, whether in
the form of direct transfers, public sector employment or state-funded
public services. Women are a majority of those affected by cuts on each
of these indicators in most of the Global North. [Austerity policies
have involved cuts in benefits and transfers; women often dominate among
pensioners, as well as among carers reliant on benefits, though the
number of men affected also increased along with the loss of jobs in
male-dominated sectors]{.underline} (Karamessini and Rubery 2013). [Not
only did all countries effectively fail to analyze the gender impact of
austerity but also even the official policy commitment to reducing
gender inequality disappeared from the European agenda in the immediate
aftermath of the crisis (Smith and Villa 2013).]{.underline} Many
European countries were required to freeze or restrict both recruitment
and pay for the female-dominated public sector workforce, yet the impact
on gender equality was not referred to or explored (Rubery 2013). [The
effects of the public services' squeeze depended on the state of
development of welfare systems; in some cases it involved dismantling
care systems (e.g., in the UK) while in others it postponed or halted
plans to expand provision to address the care infrastructure deficits
(e.g., Spain). Only the wealthier households have the opportunity to use
private sector services as a substitute for public provision but this
group in practice often relies on the use of informal private services
provided by underpaid women]{.underline}. For those unable to access
private services the cutbacks could only be met by increased unpaid
labor in the family---mainly by women---or by reductions in care. The
latter is a very real outcome in countries where it was not feasible for
families to fill the gap. For example, in the UK the cutbacks to
home-based social care for the elderly have resulted in bed blocking in
hospitals in part because the family is unable to fully substitute,
either because of geographical dispersion or the now high rate of female
employment. Most attention on the impact of austerity has focused on
those southern and eastern European countries that came under pressure
from the EU and the IMF to cut public expenditure. [However, a study of
128 countries in the Global South found that public expenditure was also
cut during the austerity period, following expansionary policy in the
immediate aftermath of the financial crisis (Ortiz and Cummins
2013).]{.underline} Furthermore, Elson (2010a) developed a framework for
both the Global South and the North to consider the interactions between
finance, production and social reproduction in response to the financial
crisis. [The analysis of how austerity processes have affected both paid
and unpaid work and the overall provision of care has highlighted both
the policymakers' neglect of the social reproduction system and their
expectation that they can still rely on women to compensate for gaps in
provision]{.underline}. Interestingly, policymakers in Europe have
sometimes had to rethink their care policies particularly with respect
to childcare, as women have increased their commitment to wage work
despite cutbacks. For example, despite being responsible for major cuts
to childcare in the 2010--15 period, by the 2015 election the
Conservative party was offering employed parents 30 hours of free
childcare for children aged three as they feared losing women's votes
(WBG 2018). However, willingness to reverse or adjust austerity policies
to minimize the impacts on the vulnerable depends on the political
orientation of the government. For example, the leftwing Greek
government succeeded in implementing a major expansion in childcare
provision (Hatzivarnava-Kazassi and Karamessini 2018) despite facing the
most severe fiscal retrenchment requirements by making creative use of
European social funds. The motivation, however, was to address child
poverty, not gender equality per se. [A comparison of Canada and Spain
has also revealed the importance of the policy orientations of the
national governments (Lahey and de Villota 2013). The Canadian
conservative government was already slashing expenditure before the
crisis while the Spanish socialist government tried to mitigate the
impact on women]{.underline}. Lahey and De Villota (2013) found that had
the Spanish socialist government remained in power past 2011 and
continued its policies, the adverse impact on women would have been
greater in Canada than in Spain, despite the more favorable overall
economic conditions. Crises and women's labor force participation The
initial feminist explorations of women's labor force participation
during crises relied on the Marxist industrial reserve army theory
(Bruegel 1979). [Although Marx did not specifically identify women as a
source of the industrial reserve army, for many economists---both
Marxist and mainstream---they constitute the apparently ideal flexible
labor force, to be drawn in to fill labor shortages in the boom and
expelled in the downturn. This flexible supply both limits workers'
power in the upturn as mobilizing new supplies of labor reduces the risk
that labor shortages will lead to industrial unrest (Kalecki 1943) and
reduces the risks of high open unemployment in the downturn as the
dismissed women are assumed to return to domestic work. Feminist
economists have challenged this conceptualization of female labor as a
constantly available flexible resource on a number of grounds. First,
Humphries (1983) criticized the construction of the industrial reserve
army thesis as applied to women as the cyclical reserve army. This she
considered a distortion of Marx's theory of the constant reproduction of
relative surplus population that acted as the floating part of the
reserve army to provide potential substitutes for those currently
employed in order to exert pressure on them to work intensively and
accept low wages or face substitution and displacement]{.underline}.
From a Marxist perspective the objective of integrating women into the
wage labor force was more for long-run secular reasons not for cyclical
flexibility, namely to convert them into the floating reserve, to act as
a potential threat to men's jobs and working conditions. [However, the
extent to which women act in practice as either a cyclical or secular
reserve army has also been shown to be restricted once a gender
perspective is adopted. One of the restrictions is the pattern of gender
segregation in the labor market which restricts the potential for women
to act as either a buffer or a substitute for men in employment (Bruegel
1979; Rubery and Tarling 1982; Rubery 1988). A second critique of the
cyclical reserve army thesis is that the women's integration into wage
work induces changes in both household organization and in women's
expectations and aspirations which make any reversal
unlikely]{.underline}. This approach regards the system of social
reproduction as developing "relatively autonomously" from the system of
production (Humphries and Rubery 1984). The reversal of women's
participation may thus be constrained by new social norms of higher
shares of wage goods in household consumption, by associated changes in
relative prices and productivity between domestically produced and wage
goods and services, and the changing expectations and aspirations of
women, reinforced by investments in their skills and education. [This
persistence of women's active participation even under low labor demand
could result in women acting as a secular reserve army, threatening
substitution for men's jobs, as has been feared by trade unions at
various points in history, particularly after the world wars (Milkman
2016). However, this substitution threat again depends, as I review
below, on the potential for desegregation of jobs and on whether women
do act as a low wage reserve army.]{.underline} In countries where women
are fully integrated into the wage labor market and institutions ensure
a high level of gender equality in work, the threat from women as a
substitute labor supply may be considerably reduced. [These critiques of
women acting as a cyclical reserve have largely been accepted by Marxist
or other nonmainstream economists but it is mainstream economists that
have relied more on the notion of women continuing to act as a
contingent labor supply in their modeling, thereby implicitly regarding
women everywhere to be mothers first. Not only are women assumed only
willing to participate in employment if this is compatible with their
prior care responsibilities but they are also assumed to be ready to
return to full-time unpaid care work if demand for female wage labor
declines]{.underline}. This approach was taken to extremes by Bertola,
Blau, and Kahn (2007) who argued that trade unions would prioritize
raising pay in sectors where the displaced workers---mainly women or
young people---would be happy to return to other activities (care work
or studies respectively) and to be maintained by other family members,
thereby reducing the social costs of the resulting reduced labor demand
(see Rubery 2011 for critique). [Such grand generalizations of both
trade union strategies and women's behavior lack plausibility; not only
are trade-union strategies far from centrally coordinated in many
countries but also women's willingness to return to unpaid care work
will depend both upon their expectations and aspirations and on their
access, for example, to unemployment benefits, training and redeployment
opportunities.]{.underline} Women in Sweden who enjoy strong rights for
flexible working and maternity leave benefits provided they are in
employment are unlikely to willingly exit the labor market. Moreover,
taking breaks from employment during periods of child raising has been
declining across all European countries, except when funded through
long-term parental leave schemes. [Feminist economists stress the
importance of context in assessing women's participation response to
economic crises, as attention to context opens up the possibility for
change in gender relations, in contrast to mainstream economists' search
for universal sexrelated behavioral responses (see Rubery 2011).
Feminist scholars have also examined the impact of crises at the
individual household level on time spent in paid work and unpaid work.
These micro level and household-specific responses may have aggregate
impacts on overall labor supply but these may be small if the
added-worker effects in some households are offset by discouraged-worker
effects in others.]{.underline} In the recent global crisis and
austerity period there is evidence of significant added-worker effects
that often outweighed discouraged worker effects. In one study of 28
transition economies, Khitarishvili (2013) distinguished between a
household-specific added-worker effect and an aggregate discouraged
worker effect induced by the less favorable macro environment; while the
discouraged-worker effect dominated among men, the added-worker effect
dominated women's responses. One study in Spain (López Andreu and Rubery
2018) found significant evidence of added-worker effects that occurred
through various mechanisms, involving reduced labor market quits for
domestic reasons, increased flows from inactivity to unemployment as
well as employment, and increased take up of part-time work but on an
involuntary basis as full-time work could not be found. A comparative
study of Spain and Portugal of women from lowincome households found
that despite decreases in pay, security and work-life balance, women's
attachment to the labor market strengthened, induced in part by the
increasing importance of women's earnings to household income (Tavora
and Rodríguez-Modroño 2018). Berik and Kongar (2013) also found evidence
in the US of narrowing gender gaps in both paid and unpaid work as men's
paid work declined and women substituted paid hours of work for unpaid
hours (while men's total work hours declined). In countries with large
informal sectors the alternative to formal sector work may be engaging
in the informal sector. Chandrasekhar and Ghosh (2009) found that women
entered informal employment in all the countries affected by the Asian
crisis and consequently suffered from falling rates of remuneration, a
pattern that was repeated in the 2008--09 crisis (Ghosh 2013). [Although
evidence on impacts on unpaid work hours is limited, one can anticipate
that many women are under pressure to increase both paid and unpaid
working hours to offset both lower men's earnings and reduced public
services.]{.underline} In a study of six low- and middle-income
countries, Elson (2010b) found that women were increasing unpaid work
hours but this was not providing anything like full compensation for the
decline in household income. In some countries, austerity policies are
also being used to extend the pressure on those with heavy care
responsibilities such as lone mothers to engage in wage work (Whitworth
and Griggs 2013). It is also employment among older women that is rising
fastest across Europe under requirements to work longer for pension
entitlements due to women's interrupted careers and the ending of the
social norm that women should be able to retire earlier than men. In the
decade up to 2018 employment rates of those aged 55--64 rose in the EU28
by 10.7 percentage points for men but by 15.9 percentage points for
women (Eurostat 2019). [These efforts to increase participation may be
interpreted as both an austerity policy to reduce welfare costs and a
strategy to increase work discipline (Greer 2016).]{.underline} Crises,
segregation and gendered labor market outcomes [One of the key critiques
of the cyclical reserve army characterization of women has been that
women and men are not straightforward substitutes in the labor market
due to the prevalence of gender segregation]{.underline}. Gender
segregation by type of firm and occupation constrains women's roles as a
cyclical reserve in a number of ways. [First, where the crisis has
uneven sectoral impacts it is highly likely that the immediate pattern
of job loss will be shaped by]{.underline} the pattern of gender
segregation by sector prior to the downturn. Gender segregation may thus
either protect women from or expose women to job loss. [In the 2008
crisis, initially male-dominated segments, such as manufacturing and
construction, were most seriously affected, leading to the crisis being
called a "man-cession," but the following austerity-driven crisis
threatened key areas of women's employment such as the public sector
leading to often more job losses or other losses of income for women
workers (Karamessini and Rubery 2013).]{.underline} These effects of
gender segregation are thus contingent on the nature of the crisis. In
other respects, the pattern of gender segregation may be considered
itself in part shaped by cyclical and long-term restructuring of the
production system. The cyclical reserve army hypothesis might expect
women to be concentrated in those occupations that face the heaviest job
losses, for example in manufacturing in the more labor-intensive
processes (Bettio 1988). The concentration of women in such vulnerable
employment areas may be related both to their relative disposability and
to their availability at low wages. This buffer hypothesis with respect
to gender segregation was tested for the 1970s/80s recessions for the
UK, US, Italy, and France and the overall result found some evidence of
women acting as a buffer in some manufacturing industries, but not
overall or in services (Rubery 1988). In the more recent crisis, not
only has manufacturing declined in significance but also results suggest
that young people and migrants were more often the buffer labor force
than women (Bettio et al. 2013).

### Liberalism/ Realism

#### Both realist and liberal approaches to IR recreate a patriarchal world order---traditional views of war and peacebuilding either elide gendered violence altogether or acknowledge it while supporting the structures that allow gendered violence to continue

There are three points that we wish to make in relation to this
analytical move. First, that we seek to build on the 'four generations'
framework to highlight gender blind-spots. [A feminist gaze could ask
how and why this narrative is frequently reproduced or note that, by
paying it attention, we are reproducing patriarchal ideas where feminism
has been marginalised and excluded from the account]{.underline}. We
deploy the 'four generations' framework because it is a reference point
for both feminist10 and critical scholars.11 It allows us to chart the
connections and concerns shared between critical and feminist PCS,
whilst demonstrating [the entrenched history of feminist marginalisation
from thinking about peace and conflict.]{.underline} [Despite its rich
heritage, feminist work frequently receives token acknowledgement by
critical scholars rather than sustained engagement and
analysis]{.underline}.12 This highlights that scholarship is deeply
political and deeply saturated in (gendered, racialised, classed) power
relations, a point that feminists have long recognised.13 Using the
'four generations' [framework as our starting point for a feminist
intervention allows us to be attentive of gender blindness and to
develop a more holistic understanding]{.underline} of PCS. There is
therefore a political purpose to telling this story. Second, we believe
[that the marginalisation of feminist theorising on peace and conflict
is reflected within practices of peacebuilding. The citational myopia
and other patterns of exclusion faced by feminist scholarship is
mirrored in practice, with gender concerns often ghettoised by
policymakers and practitioners. For example, the UN's expanding 'Women,
Peace and Security' (WPS) Agenda is rarely, if ever, discussed by
scholars not typically working within feminist 'camps'.]{.underline}
Furthermore, research on gender within the UN Peacebuilding Commission
demonstrates that references to WPS are rare within documents produced
by the Peacebuilding Commission.14 Moreover, [there is a 'tendency to
describe the WPS agenda as a "normative" agenda, and to engage with
questions of women's participation as normative questions']{.underline}.
15 Our article focuses on the marginalisation of scholars who examine
the ghettoization of women and/or gender issues in practice. I[f we are
to meaningfully transform the way that gendered and feminist goals are
addressed within peacebuilding, then the 'theoretical' and 'academic'
space is a productive starting place]{.underline}. Finally, this is not
to say that feminist and critical PCS scholars should 'merge their
perspectives, modes of inquiry, and strategies for action'. 16 We agree
with Christine Sylvester's argument that there are 'too many healthy
ambiguities within women, and within feminist theories, for there to be
any healthy reconciliation of feminist and peace projects'. 17 Rather,
[we want to realise and acknowledge the ways that feminist scholarship
and its heritage is central to critical PCS, and that continuing to
marginalise feminist analysis will result in deficiencies and
limitations]{.underline} in our analysis of peace and conflict. First
generation approaches: conflict management & achievement of negative
peace [Conflict management approaches -- associated with international
negotiation, mediation, and traditional peacekeeping -- are largely
inspired by the realist belief in the inevitability of conflict and the
impossibility of achieving resolution.18 These focus narrowly on
managing conflict situations and achieving 'negative peace'19 by halting
overt violence.]{.underline} The aim is to reinforce international order
and security by 'isolating' and 'containing' conflict.20 There is shared
agreement between critical and feminist PCS regarding the inadequacies
of conflict management approaches for building sustainable peace.
[Traditional peacekeeping missions, for example, hold a mixed record in
limiting armed conflict, and are 'virtually uniform' in their failure to
achieve conflict resolution.21 They rarely created the conditions for
peace, and worked largely to 'freeze' rather than resolve
conflict.22]{.underline} Women and gender issues were largely excluded
from traditional peacekeeping missions: for instance, between 1957 and
1989, the number of women participating in the military component of
peacekeeping missions was a mere 0.1%.23 Furthermore, the coercive power
wielded by armed peacekeepers is criticised by feminists -- for
reproducing violent masculinities which (re)create gendered forms of
insecurity,24 and for perpetuating relations of domination which are at
the root of violent conflict.25 [Traditional diplomacy, meanwhile,
frequently produced settlements based on 'peace without justice' and
often found it difficult to address the rising number of intra-state
conflicts due to its state-centric view of conflict.26 Feminist scholars
have documented the long-standing absence of women from formal peace
negotiations.27]{.underline} Obstacles include highly gendered norms and
practices of diplomacy, which associate negotiations and mediation with
men, masculinity, and military affairs.28 The lack of recognition of
women as significant peace-making actors is another factor; as is the
priority afforded to high-level political and military actors (usually
men), at the expense of women's interests and demands.29 [From a
feminist perspective, conflict management approaches, in theory and in
practice, reflect and sustain a 'cult of power' within peace research --
one which marginalises the perspectives and contributions of relatively
'powerless' non-state actors, including many women, girls, and
non-binary people.30 Furthermore, the goal of promoting negative peace,
is strongly criticised by feminists, who point out that this leaves
(gendered) forms of direct violence (e.g. gender-based violence),
structural violence (patriarchy), and cultural violence (militarism)
unaddressed.31]{.underline} Second generation approaches: conflict
resolution & fulfilment of human needs 'Second generation' conflict
resolution approaches to ending conflict emerged in response to the
limitations of conflict management methodologies, and take the view that
[conflicts can be resolved rather than merely managed]{.underline}.32
[These approaches aim to create grass-roots mechanisms and processes
capable of j conflicts.33 Through problem-solving workshops, third-party
facilitation, and project-oriented approaches, bottom-up methods are
employed to address the social, psychological, and structural roots of
conflict.]{.underline}34 Feminist scholars and activists have challenged
[the absence of women, gender, and feminist insights from conflict
resolution theory and practice.]{.underline}35 Conflict resolution
approaches are appealing, given that [they engage civil society in
peacebuilding, and promote a peace based around mutual agreement and
justice.]{.underline}36 They advocate a shift from official, Track I
diplomacy towards the use of unofficial, Track II initiatives. [These
processes are designed to enable all parties to feel that they have
'won']{.underline} 37 [by satisfying basic needs -- to security,
recognition, political representation, and economic participation --
which are considered the root causes of conflict.]{.underline}38
Furthermore, [the techniques deployed by third-party mediators are
designed not to achieve manipulation or control, but rather to assist
conflicting parties in processes of self-realization and immanent
transformation,39 and a true resolution rather than a compromise or
settlement.]{.underline}40 [This may unlock possibilities for achieving
a self-sustaining peace]{.underline}.41 Yet, despite their early promise
and innovative techniques, commentators have questioned the efficacy of
these methods.42 Critical PCS scholars highlight that, [if undertaken
without adequate consideration of the impact of asymmetric power
relations and structural constraints, conflict resolution will merely
strengthen the stronger party's position and (re)produce conditions of
domination, injustice, and inequality]{.underline}.43 [The isolation of
peace-making from the social and cultural context in which conflict is
embedded is also identified as a major weakness.44]{.underline} Feminist
researchers critique [the 'gender-blindness' of mainstream theories and
practices for excluding women]{.underline} from Track II mediation (as
facilitators and participants); and note that [problem-solving workshops
often fail to consider the significance of gender for conflict analysis
and resolution]{.underline}.45 [Without explicit discussion of how
gender roles, identities, and structures of power are entangled in
conflict]{.underline} and its resolution, Track II initiatives may
create the 'impression that conflict and war are genderless phenomena'.
46 To ensure that conflict resolution processes and outcomes are
gender-just, feminists identify the need for theorists and practitioners
to build theories and methodologies that can identify and [address
context-specific gender norms, identities, and power structures in sites
of conflict, and also recognize the 'practical' and 'strategic' gender
interests of women situated in conflicted contexts]{.underline}.47 Third
generation approaches: the liberal peace [Women, gender, and feminism
have historically been relegated to the margins of PCS, as our
discussion of the first and second generations illustrates]{.underline}.
Yet, from the 1990s onwards, major transformations in peace operations
were accompanied by a growing acceptance that gender equality is a
significant aspect of peacebuilding. After the Cold War, internationally
supported peacebuilding missions were legitimated by the aim of building
a 'liberal peace'.- 48 Peacebuilding interventions in sites of conflict
followed a standardised, top-down model of reconstruction that
prioritises Western politico-cultural norms and neo-liberal economics.49
Liberal peacebuilding combines traditional forms of peacekeeping,
mediation, and negotiation, with a range of activities designed to
promote democratisation and good governance, respect for human rights
and the rule of law, active civil society, and the development of open
market economies.50 Such missions were deployed in Africa (Namibia),
Asia (Cambodia), Europe (Croatia), and Latin America (El Salvador), from
as early as 1989.51 [In many contexts, the United Nations and other
international peacebuilding actors have held extensive mandates to
organise elections, reshape military and civil administration, maintain
law and order, repatriate and resettle refugees, and rehabilitate
infrastructure.52 What is clear is that conflict management and
resolution had moved a long way from simply 'freezing' a
conflict.]{.underline} In parallel with these changes, peacebuilding
actors increasingly recognised the genderspecific impact of armed
conflict, and the significant role that women play in all aspects of
peacebuilding. Significantly, the UN Security Council passed Resolution
1325 on Women, Peace and Security in October 2000, which urged for the
integration of a gender perspective across UN peace and security
processes. To date, a total of eight WPS resolutions have been
adopted.53 Taken together, these resolutions articulate an agenda to
prevent sexual and gender-based violence, encourage the meaningful
participation of women in peace and security processes, and to protect
women's rights in conflict and post-conflict contexts. The effects of
the WPS agenda has been surprisingly pervasive and wide-ranging. It has
shaped funding and agendas across the UN system; programmes of national
governments and regional organisations54; influenced feminist activism
across the world55; and academic interest in the WPS agenda can be
described as 'an industry'.56 [Feminist scholars and activists have
fought hard to integrate women and gender perspectives into
peacebuilding. Yet, significant obstacles to gender justice and equality
remain]{.underline}. For example, between 1992 and 2011, only 2 percent
of chief mediators and 9 percent of negotiators in peace processes were
women.57 And, of 85 peace agreements signed between 1990 and 2010, only
16 percent contained any references to women and/or gender.58
[Post-conflict peacebuilding initiatives frequently (re-)produce a
'patriarchal gender order'.59 There is an ongoing need to challenge
masculinist visions of peace as a process which excludes women, and as
an outcome which fails to tackle gender-based violence and provide for
gender justice and equality.60]{.underline} Liberal peacebuilding
interventions have been roundly critiqued by both critical and feminist
PCS scholarship. [Both 'camps' have, for example, highlighted the gulf
that exists between the normative agenda espoused by liberal
peacebuilding actors and the everyday realities of those groups and
communities affected by peace and conflict.61]{.underline} Both
approaches have examined the unequal encounters, narratives and
interactions between 'local' and 'international' actors in conflicted
and post-conflict settings.62 [They note the tendency for peace and
security interventions to reinforce, rather than disrupt, hierarchical
structures and relations of power,63 and have examined the differential
capacities of peacebuilding subjects to respond in agential and
resistant ways.64]{.underline} In particular, critical PCS has
questioned the failure to engage with the everyday needs, voices, and
interests of 'local' stakeholders.65 [Peacebuilding, they argue, has
been captured by hegemonic interests and neo-colonial agendas, and the
liberal vision of peace is fatally undermined by cultural insensitivity,
technocratic rationality, exclusion, and coercion.66 Feminist scholars
point to the significant gaps between international rhetoric on WPS, and
the reality of implementation.67]{.underline} They highlight the
propensity of liberal peacebuilding actors to articulate essentialist
notions of gender and (re)produce gendered hierarchies of power in
(post-) conflict environments.68 As the above discussion highlights,
there is much that is shared between critical and feminist analyses of
peacebuilding. Both have articulated important questions about the
effectiveness and the legitimacy of the liberal peace. [However, as we
outline below, feminist work frequently receives token acknowledgement
by critical scholars rather than sustained engagement and
analysis]{.underline}. Despite potential connections, the synergies
between critical and feminist approaches remain under-explored.

### Military

#### The aff is rooted in masculine ideologies that make any ethical anti-war solutions impossible. Only a radical reconceptualization of masculinity in politics will solve the deep-rooted misogynistic values in the military. 

**Partis-Jennings 17** (Hannah Partis-Jennings research focuses on
gender, performance, and spatial practice in liberal peace paradigms and
her PhD, from the University of St Andrews, focused specifically on
Afghanistan where she conducted field research in 2014**, "**Military
Masculinity and the Act of Killing in Hamlet and Afghanistan." Men and
Masculinities. 2019; 22(2): 254-272. doi:10.1177/1097184X17718585) -SAJ

[Military masculinity is a term to describe the sets of norms and
behaviors most valued and aspired to in a military context]{.underline}
(Eichler 2014). It includes elements such as physical strength, bravery,
a lack of emotions such as fear and sadness, and a denigration of the
feminized (p. 82). It is both an individual and an institutional
paradigm (Kronsell 2016). Feminist scholarship has grown wary of
simplistically engaging military masculinity as a category of analysis
noting that it is a fluid and shifting category, complex, and
intersectional and that naming it contributes to the process of its
construction (see Bulmer 2013; Higate 2003; Welland 2013). I use it here
to elucidate how gendered performances of war frame acts of killing as
they take place. Yet I also push the boundaries of thinking around
[military masculinity]{.underline} to argue that [it implies a process
of performance and interpretation---witnessing performance, telling of
it, framing it---as well as of action]{.underline}. Butler writes that
[our identities are bound tightly together with our vulnerability to
others, our inherent need to be defined as an entity in fluid relation
to that Other which stands definitional against the "I]{.underline}"
(2010, 33). Her conceptions of ethics and the nature of being are
connected to our inevitable dependence upon the Other. Yet she sees the
notion of relational ethics, of relating to another within an ethical
spectrum, as strictly bound within certain logics of war and violence.
While [soldiers/combatants/wartime populations may be encouraged to
develop fierce loyalty to their intimate group/fellow soldiers or
citizens, the possibility of relating to the enemy Other is cognitively
curtailed]{.underline}. There are nuances and complexities within this,
and it is a fluid and performative construction of enmity. Yet, arguably
[there is a particular conception of the "enemy" employed in traditional
performances of military masculinity which shuts down any possibility of
understanding them as fully human]{.underline} (Butler 2010; Hearn 2012,
46). [This war-based enmity is structured by those who manifest it
through cognitive boundary making with gendered and racialized elements
such as gendered shaming and the denigration of that which is understood
as feminized]{.underline} (Cohn 1987; Mann 2014). Cohn suggests that
[the masculine ideal fostered by the military is one which validates
action over thought, which cultivates the capacity to subdue the
thinking mind and is therefore fundamentally "antiethical," and she
argues that many emotions are suppressed in war and hatred is given a
prime position in the hierarchy of allowable feelings]{.underline}
(1999, 462). Moreover, the capacity and desire to think ethically, [to
consider the relationality of human existence which might provoke
empathy and render violence more difficult, can be coded as feminine and
radically denigrated and devalued]{.underline} (Cohn 1987). Arguably,
[within the context of military training, a certain capacity to act
without excessive thought is associated with masculine
bravery]{.underline} (Mann 2014). As Hamlet suggests, ["conscience does
make cowards of us all" where conscience and therefore cowardliness are
the domain of the feminized]{.underline} (Shakespeare 2007, 1958).
Thus[, the supremacy of action over thought and the denigration of
relational intellectualizing are gendered and become a justificatory
mechanism, a fundamental structure of heroic masculinity which shuts
down ethical cognition, policing the boundaries of allowable action.
Institutionalized fear of any feminized trend toward nonviolence in the
structures of militarism has severe consequences]{.underline}. In the
First World War, for instance, the British Army executed 306 of its own
soldiers for "cowardliness"---the refusal to fight and kill
(Taylor-Whiffen 2011). Cohn's (1999) analysis of gendered military
practices and the film Saving Private Ryan makes the point that one
character is symbolically vilified for his feminized capacity to show
mercy, and his nonviolent ethic is linked to the subsequent death of
heroic masculine soldiers[. What is most notable about this notion of
cowardliness is the shamefulness it evokes]{.underline} Partis-Jennings
3 (Mann 2014; Cohn 1987). [That understood as feminine is purged
partially through linking it with shame and the necessity to prove one's
capacity to demonstrate masculine traits, shaming and humiliating those
that cannot maintain the "courage, power and authority exclusively
associated with masculinity" in the logic of warfare and
militarism]{.underline} (Sasson-Levy 2003, 451). In the case of Marine
A, the act of killing itself, recorded visually and audibly, is the
moment which fixed a performance to be interpreted. [Killing as
performance is the most intimate act, the most imbued with gendered
weight where "militarized masculinities function as spatiotemporal
landmarks that give killing in war its'orientation' and make it morally
intelligible"]{.underline} (Daggett 2015, 361). This perfor-mance of
enmity enacted within and through the confusion and fear of active war
killing is a site of particular ethical significance. Yet arguably, the
echoing up of this performative infrastructure generated by the public
availability of the killing is an equally central site of mediated
enmity in which the affective centrality of the logic of war becomes
evident in a virtual domain (in this article, particularly YouTube anda
specifically designed website).To discuss this incident in a way that
elucidates a particular performance mili-tarized masculinity, I draw on
Shakespeare'sHamlet. I am thus engaging with theso-called aesthetic
turn---a mode of understanding and interpretation which"reorients our
very understanding of the political" (Bleiker 2001, 511), where by
"aesthetic sources are models for rethinking political global
predicaments" (L. Frost2010, 435). Using an aesthetic lens to understand
aspects of the study of interna-tional relations has interesting lineage
(see Bleiker 2001; L. Frost 2010; Holden2006; Jabri 2006; Moore and
Shepherd 2010). This approach highlights "\[t\]he factthat through the
work of art a truth is experienced that we cannot attain in any
otherway" (Gadamer 1975, 18) and the implications this has for global
politics. Thus, in looking at the intertextual dynamics between
Hamletand Marine A shooting aninjured Taliban insurgent, I engage with
an approach that is both disruptive and reflective, that offers insight
while equally making the familiar strange (L. Frost2010) and implicating
the interpreters and representations of a given moment in the
overarching logic that gives that moment meaning (Jabri 2006; Bleiker
2001, 513).Military masculinity then can be understood as an
interpretative framework throughwhich war is read, an aesthetic through
which violence is consumed. [Technology and virtual consumption are
implicated in militarized masculinity as it now exists. Eisenstein
argues that "\[ign this techno-masculinist world we inhabit we are shown
war as the drama of manhood"]{.underline} (Eisenstein 2007, 24[), a
drama not always dependent on biological sex or particular acts but upon
"masculine discourses that can be adopted by males or
females]{.underline}" (p. 27) and represented in the wider public
domain.

### Securitization

#### Securitization serves to reinforce the US role as masculine protector, subjecting the "protected" to US violence

**Partis-Jennings 17**

Hannah, Lecturer in the School of Politics and International Relations
at University College Dublin. "The (in)security of gender in
Afghanistan's peacebuilding project: hybridity and affect,"
International Feminist Journal of Politics, 19:4, 411-425, DOI:
10.1080/14616742.2017.1279418 LJS

Hybridity is described by critical peacebuilding scholars in different
ways, however for the purposes of this article it can be understood as
the way that aspects of the "international" and aspects of the "local"
can "coalesce and conflict to different extents on different issues to
produce a fusion" (MacGinty 2010, 397). It involves the merging of the
"liberal international order ... with other non-liberal indigenous
institutions, norms and practices at the domestic level" (Laffey and
Nadarajah 2012, 406). [Central to the notion of hybridity is the idea
that power is flexible and contradictory; that a paradigm of dominance
can be shifted and reinterpreted, taken up in different forms and with
different intentions, and still maintain the central touchstones of its
hierarchies intact]{.underline} (Kothari 2006, 239). [McLeod (2015)
provides a feminist critique of the concept of hybridity, arguing that a
feminist lens elucidates "a nuanced perception of the power relations
between local and international actors" (49--50) and that comparing and
"contrasting the wartime experiences of local and international actors
allows a sense of the organising logics that limit and make possible
certain meanings of gender" (59).]{.underline} It is specifically
feminist in exploring the "diversity of the personal," which hybridity
normally neglects, and in understanding "international" actors as
individuals rather than just as a collective (52). A feminist approach
to hybridity understands that "\[a\]s war and post-war can be
experienced in multifarious ways, local and international advocates
bring diverse conceptualisations of that war based upon the windows of
knowledge that they can access, and have accessed" (49). McLeod suggests
a focus on the emotional and the embodied levels of peacebuilding,
noting that "how the body 'feels' the world impinges upon how the world
is experienced and described" (53), and I build further on McLeod's
insights using the notion of affect. Shepherd's (2014) feminist
engagement with peacebuilding suggests "reorienting research towards the
affective and relational dimensions of peace activities" (112), and I
attempt to do that here. [Affect understood as prepersonal is slightly
different from particular emotions, and not individual as such, but
environmental (Shouse 2005). It is the conditions in which emotions can
come to be articulated fully, a sensory perception of the parameters
that are set for feelings to be felt]{.underline}. I thus go back a step
from McLeod, looking for felt experiences but also the environmental
aspects that bring them into iteration. Using both interview data and
observation, I perceive affect as "amorphous potential that remains
outside of discourse, which is difficult to articulate but none-the-less
has effects within discourse" (Solomon 2012, 908).2 In the latter part
of the article I "underline the not-necessarily reflexive sensory
dimensions of experience by paying attention to the perceptual
dimensions of our actions and the habituated and routine nature of
everyday existence" (Vannini 2015, 323). [This aligns with McLeod's
(2015) view that "hidden or mundane practices and processes operate
alongside macro-political processes" in peacebuilding (52). I illustrate
how different kinds of interactions in the protection--gender--security
nexus in my field research data and experience were affectively coded
with deep uncertainty and imbued with power imbalances between
masculinist protector and feminized protected. My central argument in
this article is that a masculinist logic of protection in peacebuilder
security practices helps to create an affective environment in which
being female becomes always already hybrid, uncertain and affectively
linked to insecurity. Young (2003) develops a framework in which a
masculinist protector figure shields a subservient, feminized protected
from a dangerous and unknown male Other "out there" who must be
securitized against.]{.underline} Should the protected resist, there is
an understanding that they would be abandoned to an unknowable threat
(14). [Thus, the protected and feminized in this paradigm is always
subject to the uncertainty of a disempowering safety, a protection that
is also an implicit threat. I argue here that the logic of masculinist
protection seen in security practices helps to foster the kind of
affective environment in which notions of patriarchal protection are
constantly underlying and intertwining with gender
meanings]{.underline}. This affective environment is a hybrid between
the protective logics of security practices linked to peacebuilding, and
a sense of traditionalist patriarchal protection frameworks in the
Afghan context. I do not mean to equate the experiences of peacebuilding
actors with Afghan women who may be subjected to patriarchal control,
but to point to an affective hybridity tied to certain kinds of
protection logics, in which gender is bounded and delineated. Given the
space restrictions of this article, I do not unpack the meaning or
reality of traditionalist patriarchal protection frameworks in
Afghanistan, but consider references to it in my interviews. My
intention here is to investigate how affective environments might relate
to gender and (in)security, and how this can be read through the lens of
a feminist approach to hybridity in which ideas around Afghan
patriarchy, security routines, foreign status and female status mix
together.

#### Narratives of insecurity serve to retrench masculine authority and myths of women as victims

**Partis-Jennings 17**

Afghanistan's peacebuilding project: hybridity and affect,"

[These extracts also suggest different kinds of cross-cutting complicity
between the "international" and a logic of masculinist protection. While
there is a constant process of flux and contradiction operating here
(particularly in the relationship between international and gender
status), there is also an affective gendered order in which, once again,
female equates to vulnerability faster and more "naturally" than male
ever would.]{.underline} Gendered security praxis In addition to the
mode of hybridity demonstrated in how civil society actors talked about
the protection--gender--security nexus that I have discussed above, I
now move to include a consideration of how less conscious, routine,
unnoticed or habitual practices relating to protection and security help
to create a gender-liminal space in Afghanistan, marked by hybridity. It
is here that my feminist take on hybridity builds most on McLeod's by
prompting questions of embodied and affective power and (in)security. It
is not my intention to offer an alternative way of practicing security
in dangerous settings, or to suggest that these security procedures are
necessarily unjustified. However, a feminist curiosity leads me to
explore how these practices are coded with gender in certain ways, and
what kind of power dynamics and "embodied subjectivity" (Frerks, Ypeij,
and König 2014, 8) this gendering might involve (Shepherd 2014). Since
both male and female peacebuilders (and Afghan elites) are protected by
these practices, my discussion must be understood in abstract terms,
exploring how protection logics are founded on gendered ideas. [It is
the feminized international (and elite national) body that is secured by
routine practices, rather than just women, but the validation of
masculinist protection required has affective, gender-laden
implications.]{.underline} From what I saw and heard about in Kabul,
most business and expatriate homes were guarded by private security
personnel -- all were men, some were Afghan, many were not. These
private security personnel operate through performances of masculinity
in various ways, and with varying degrees of theatricality and
visibility (Higate 2012a, 2012b). In Afghanistan particularly, because
of the high perceived and actual threat level, these masculine
performances center on weapons, masculine physicality and a stoic, tough
demeanor; often sunglasses and military-style clothing feature strongly,
and the notion that these gendered indicators will be perceived as
threatening and dominating by others is vital for their success (Connell
2005; Higate 2012b). [Performances and props of violence have an
undeniably hypermasculine dimension (Higate 2012a, 2012b), particularly
when those private security actors wielding or performing them are
almost exclusively male, and manifest their working identities through
stereotypical tropes of masculine prowess.]{.underline} In my
experience, the structures that made up homes, cafes and workplace
compounds were also laden with the symbolism of masculinist militarism
and aggression -- razor wire, high blast-proof walls, guard buildings
and watchtowers. [In an affective mode, symbols of security such as the
fortified aid compound are compatible with an ideology of aggression and
Othering connected to a certain kind of (hyper)masculinized frontierism
(Young 2003, 2), and a militarized logic that prioritizes masculine
dominance in an abstract form -- the values associated with notions of
masculinity rather than actual men]{.underline} (Hutchings 2008; Hearn
2012). An embodied, spatial and commonsensical dichotomy existed in
Kabul between vulnerable/feminized (devoid of the trappings of
violence), and the hypermasculine means of violent action that protect
against vulnerability (Young 2003; Frerks, Ypeij, and König 2014). Lisa
was the only one of my respondents to directly link security practices
and the protective infrastructure in Afghanistan to her (in)security. Of
all my respondents, Lisa was the most reflexive, and also someone who
demonstrated the greatest hybridity in her responses. She was very vocal
(as illustrated in the previous section) about feeling unsafe as a woman
particularly, and yet equally articulated a sense that this insecurity
was exacerbated by the affective environment in which she found herself,
an insecurity that went beyond that generated by the Taliban: \[T\]he
securitization of space matters so much, I don't know that I'm nearly as
unsafe as I feel, I used to walk a lot, when I first came I walked all
the time, I don't know that my decision to not walk is really based on
anything rational or on the fact that nobody else that I know walks,
everywhere you go there is razor wire. I really think that the
psychology of conflict architecture, of having blastwalls everywhere,
police checkpoints every twenty feet, guys with AK47s everywhere makes
you feel deeply unsafe, if you were in a safe place why would it look
like it does? Picking up on Lisa's experience of "guys with AK47s
everywhere" and unpacking it further, I suggest that the fortified aid
compounds and private security personnel (as well as armored cars, the
prevalence of weaponry, security checkpoints, procedures for entering
buildings, safe rooms, etc.) generate an affective environment of
insecurity that is also gendered. [In this context, "narratives of risk
and response" created by security personnel or institutions set the
parameters for how a given environment can be perceived, and police the
mechanisms that can be used to negotiate the everyday contexts of these
environments (Higate 2012a, 14). Ideas around masculinity and masculine
dominance are engaged in complex relation with this "construction and
governance of insecurity and danger" (Berndtsson 2011, 1; Higate 2012a,
20), since "(male) (security) operational rationality" and physical
capacity is understood to mitigate risk (Stiehm 1982; Higate 2012a, 17).
While private military contractors and personnel provide a gendered
narrative and meaning that is often complex and negotiated (Higate
2012c; Eichler 2015), in an affective mode in Kabul these security
personnel signaled a hypermasculine frame of reference founded on the
visuality of lethal weapons, the macho demeanor of the men wielding them
and the implicit understanding that "military calculation" is the
"epitome of rationality" (Stiehm 1982, 375; Higate 2012a, 20). Security
practices, such as living and working in guarded buildings, traveling
with and hiring close protection staff, armored cars, security liaisons
and so on, thus create a situation whereby safety and violence are
behaviorally conflated, and the trappings and rituals of violence are an
affective foundation for any understanding of gender in that
environment]{.underline}. It is an environment that martials a
precognitive sense of (almost) fear and (always) threat in gendered
terms. [This raises questions of the extent to which, within the
peacebuilder paradigm, the "cultivation of fear and anxiety ... was
fostered as a disciplinary strategy" that in affective ways "cemented
the masculinised protector role rooted in control and authority" (Higate
2012a, 14).]{.underline} In an extract from my field notes I illustrate
a sense of oppressive gendering that I almost but not directly linked to
the ubiquity of men with guns; I am aware of being female in a negative
sense, but it does not seem like I cognitively process why that is the
case: Again the feeling of being female was palpable. I could smell the
particular kind of bread they cook here. The air was dusty and damp. The
streets were quiet. There were a few men sitting around with guns. As
usual it was unclear what they were guarding. (Author field notes 1 May
2014) Lisa more explicitly articulated her perception of a feedback loop
between masculinized protection, which understood women (and children)
as vulnerable and men as their protectors, and the affective impact of
security measures: \[Y\]ou are coming into a society where there is
already a very strong tradition of protection around women, part of that
is after you have come through decades of sustained conflict and of
course men and women experience that differently and especially in
Afghanistan, where you have already a patriarchal society, so many
children -- so there is a need to protect women and children in a
conflict environment. [When you have this sustained, visible insecurity
-- in the sense of measures to try to prevent insecurity -- it is a
further justification to continue this need to protect who you have been
protecting all along.]{.underline} I read a visceral understanding in
her words, a struggle to make verbal sense of what work a pre-discursive
mode of masculinized protection, which seems to self-perpetuate in
commonsensical ways, does for gender and for what it means to be female
or male in Afghanistan. The fact that the logic of masculinist
protection in civilian peacebuilding practices remained just beyond and
beneath full articulation (Holland and Solomon 2014), and yet did seem
to have affective implications for how my participants thought about
gender, would indicate that the affective nature and ubiquity of this
logic helps to render it commonsensical. A feminist approach to
hybridity pays attention to the way that war or postwar is experienced
differently by different actors. [Thus looking at the mode of security
practices in Afghanistan that are engaged to protect peacebuilding
actors (and Afghan elites), and seeing that this operates within a
gendered logic, elucidates how gender and security in Afghanistan must
necessarily be understood within a liminal space that values
masculinized protection]{.underline}. Added to this is the push to
demonstrate improvements in women's rights since 2001, and the
perception of a fundamentally patriarchal social context (Billaud 2012).
While more research needs to be done on further implications of this
dynamic[, I suggest that the reliance of peacebuilding practices on a
logic of masculine protection, and the coding of hypermasculine
signifiers as harbingers of security, influence the affective
environment in which gender can be understood, owned, resisted and
reinterpreted. In this affective environment, the hybrid interactions
between gender and security evidenced by my interview data take on a
particular kind of framing. They can be seen to be bracketed by a
constant flux and unease, which renders gender, particularly female
gender, always already a hybrid, insecure and uncertain
concept.]{.underline}

[Critics of contemporary feminism argue that these objectives have
recently been cannibalized by neoliberalism]{.underline}. Fraser (2013),
Prügl (2015) and Rottenberg (2014), among others, argue strongly that
the 'neoliberalization of' feminist movement agendas has occurred. [This
includes the emergence of 'transnational business feminism' (Roberts,
2015) whereby states, corporations, international bodies and
non‐governmental organizations (NGOs) develop a 'business case' for
women\'s equality, and 'market feminism' (Kantola & Squires, 2012)
whereby products and marketing campaigns draw on feminist notions of
'choice' (Kirkpatrick, 2010) and 'empowerment' as selling
points.]{.underline} Indeed, the ostensibly feminist goals of
empowerment, choice and agency have proliferated as buzzwords under
neoliberal feminism (Kirkpatrick, 2010; Rottenberg, 2014). These are
defined with reference to the advancement of individual women, rather
than as a shared struggle in search of collective solutions to advance
gender equality in society (Rottenberg, 2014). The neoliberalization of
feminism has proliferated in the context of rising corporate power and
neoliberal economics (Rottenberg, 2014), and has involved sidelining
debates about the gendered, and racialized, structures and substructures
which underpin organizations and which perpetuate inequality (Acker,
2006). [Yet feminist social movements have not gone away]{.underline}.
They are, in fact, alive and kicking. [We argue that we need to look
more closely at how they are evolving to adopt new strategies for gender
equality in the context of an increasingly corporate‐dominated
world]{.underline}. It is these strategies that this article elucidates
and theorizes in such contexts[. By so doing we address the question of
how feminist social movements contest the neoliberalization of feminism
in an increasingly corporate‐dominated world and develop new strategies
for their transformative social change objectives]{.underline}? In
addressing these issues, this article focuses on corporations.
Corporations have been of long‐standing interest to feminist scholars
because they employ large numbers of people globally and have been shown
to rely on gender inequality as a resource (Acker, 2006), exploiting
women\'s low pay transnationally and relying upon the unpaid care work
done by women to sustain workers and organizations. [In this sense,
organizations can be conceived of as 'inequality regimes']{.underline}
(Acker, 2006). Corporations are also powerful: influencing regulation,
business practices and popular culture globally, including gender
relations. We argue that the growing economic and political power of
corporations, and their global reach, means that the ways in which they
do or do not address gender equality have become increasingly important
with respect to feminist agendas, and increasingly worthy of
investigation (Grosser & Moon, 2017). One of the key ways in which
corporations advance more neoliberal forms of feminism is through
corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives (Roberts, 2015;
Tornhill, 2016a). CSR is a highly contested concept extending to
corporate accountability for social and environmental impacts, and
involves a wide range of strategies, actions and governance systems
relating to workplaces, supply chains, communities and the environment
(Crane, Matten, & Moon, 2008). [Numerous social movements now focus on
and develop strategies to influence corporations, as well as
governments, acting as adversaries but also at times as partners (den
Hond & de Bakker, 2007; Mena & Waeger, 2014; Rasche, de Bakker, & Moon,
2013), including in CSR initiatives]{.underline}. Therefore, it would
not be surprising to find feminist social movements also campaigning
against corporations, participating in CSR initiatives or building new
alliances with corporate actors. This article thus explores the ways in
which these strategies are emerging amongst feminist social movements.
[The key argument is that in order to understand the neoliberalization
of feminism, and in particular how it is being contested, we need to
refocus our attention on feminist social movements themselves, where
activism occurs]{.underline}. To this end, we draw upon social movement
theory (SMT) (McAdam, McCarthy, & Zald, 1996; Pollack & Hafner‐Burton,
2000) to elucidate feminist activist involvement in political
opportunities, mobilizing structures and strategic framing processes in
the context of new governance involving business as well as government.
This article makes two contributions: first, we extend theory with
respect to the relationship between CSR and feminism (Grosser & Moon,
2017), contributing to research on the neoliberalization of feminism and
providing a conceptual framework for further research on this topic.
Second, we provide examples of new kinds of feminist activist strategies
that contest the neoliberalization of feminism as advanced by
corporations and through CSR. The theory article proceeds as follows. We
first define the neoliberalization of feminism, and explore the rising
power of corporations and their involvement in new governance systems.
[We elucidate the growth of CSR and gender initiatives as key sites
where neoliberal feminism is being advanced]{.underline}. We then use
three key SMT concepts: political opportunities; mobilizing structures;
and strategic framing processes, to help us explore how feminist social
movements organize and agitate for change[. We argue that far from being
co‐opted, feminist social movements contest neoliberalism in a variety
of innovative ways.]{.underline}

-SAJ

In my article 'Problematizing military masculinity, intersectionality
and male vulnerability in feminist critical military studies'(2017), I
outline some of the innovations in previous research on military
masculinity; its plural and more broad formation as militarized
masculinities; and some of the new, yet limited, directions of research
which pays attention to gender in studies of militarized individuals and
communities. In particular, I draw on the work of Crenshaw (1989, 1991),
one of the founding black feminist scholars of the concept of
intersectionality, in order to share my increasing anxiety with what I
argue is a process of depoliticization in critical military studies
(CMS). However, to call this depoliticization is itself problematic.
[What I should have argued is that this is rather a re-politicization
and reinforcement of racial, gender, and class hierarchies both inside
and outside of formal militaries and within and across a range of
academic disciplines. This is evident in the superficial engagement with
intersectionality by some military masculinity scholars or the use of
intersectionality in what Carbado (2013) calls'colour-blind'ways which
'cover over' privilege1 through the co-optation of a radical and
emancipatory body of theories for examining 'multiple differences' and
which I discuss in more detail (Henry 2017).]{.underline} Scholars who
use intersectionality as a framework for challenging interlocking
oppressions, and those primarily interested in the interface or the
mutually constituting nature of masculinities and militarization, may be
engaged in different epistemic and political projects. Yet it is
surprising that the feminist inspiration generated by Enloe in the
concept of military masculinity (1983) seems to have waned in regard to
paying attention to constructions of femininity, femininities, and
patriarchy (Enloe 2017). [There is a scholarship that pays attention to
women in the military, military femininities, and female military
masculinities (i.e. Sasson-Levy 2011; Tasker 2002), but this work
remains marginal within the subfield of militarized
masculinities]{.underline}. Has the potential for critical perspectives
within CMS been extinguished by a focus on military masculinity without
feminism? Without intersectional feminism? While the subfield of
militarized masculinities has been innovative in taking gender seriously
in the context of male-dominated institutions, I ask, where are studies
that focus on the persistence of patriarchy (Enloe 2017) and militarized
femininities as a subject in their own right (Enloe 2015)? While work on
Israeli military identities raises a number of questions about
intersectionality's limits, [it is evident that the burden of analysing
gender (and its intersection with other axes of difference) remains with
feminist critical military scholars. However, I argue that militarized
masculinities cannot afford to neglect feminist theories and concepts
and must engage in the project of smashing what bell hooks refers to as
imperialist white supremacist capitalist \[hetero\]
patriarchy]{.underline} (hooks 2006: 60). This means that
military/militarized masculinities could return to the critical and
radical basis of intersectionality, the lived experiences of those
communities referred to by such concepts, or the normative project for
which intersectionality is the daily bread: black feminism (i.e.
Combahee River Collective 1977; Lorde 1984; hooks 1984; Collins 1986).
While my article was cynical about the growing epistemic commodification
of intersectionality more generally, I am hopeful for new scholarship in
the subfield. [Recent studies of militarized masculinities, although not
always using intersectionality directly, demonstrate hope for a radical
transformation of the existing gendered, classed, and racial global
order by politicizing which and when differences matter; why
inequalities persist; and where military men and women are not equally
recognised, posititioned or privileged]{.underline}. Some examples of
this work include Richter-Monpetit (2016), Barkawi (2017); Burnett and
Milani (2017), Ingelaere and Wilén (2017), Chisholm (2017), McCaffrey
and Donohue (2017) Partis-Jennings (2017), Zalewski (2017), Eriksson
Baaz and Verweijen (2018) and Myrttinen (2018). [This work is situated
within new epistemic assemblages which challenge the gendered, sexual,
racial, and/or neoliberal systems of oppression by paying homage to the
work of critical, radical, and political scholarship on heterosexism,
colonialism, and capitalism]{.underline} (Ahmed 2013), or by simply
taking up the task of smashing. There is no better moment for CMS
scholars to do the same.

## Impacts

### Authoritarianism

#### Authoritarianism is a product of patriarchy---wielding authoritarian power becomes an exercise in masculinity and policy reforms merely make this patriarchy more sustainable

**Enloe 17**

Cynthia, Research Professor in the Department of International
Development, Community, and Environment, with affiliations with Women's
and Gender Studies and Political Science, all at Clark University in
Worcester, Massachusetts. . "CHAPTER ONE Pink Pussy Hats vs.
Patriarchy." The Big Push Exposing and Challenging the Persistence of
Patriarchy. University of California Press. Pp 34-43. LJS

[The fact that patriarchy is a term so many people shy away from using
is one of the things that enables it to survive.]{.underline} Patriarchy
is everyday sexism, but it is more than everyday sexism. Patriarchy
embraces misogyny, but relies on more than misogyny. Patriarchy produces
gender inequality, but its consequences run deeper than gender
inequality. [Patriarchy is a system---a dynamic web---of particular
ideas and relationships]{.underline}. That system of interwoven ideas
and relationships is not brittle; it is not static. [Patriarchy can be
updated and modernized]{.underline}. It is stunningly adaptable. That is
the sense in which it is useful, I think, to talk about patriarchy as
"sustainable." Today, we think of "sustainability" as a positive thing,
as a reference point with which to measure whether any practice or
policy is worthy of our support. Thus the newest United Nations goals
for international development are called the Sustainable Development
Goals ("SDGs" to UN insiders). To be positively sustainable, a project
should meet more than short-term objectives; it should be designed for
the long term. To be sustainable, an undertaking should eschew narrow
self-interests, insteadproviding benefits for the widest possible
constituency. To be sustain able, a policy should be earth-centric, not
merely human-centric. • Planting cash crops dependent on soil-degrading
chemicals is not sustainable. • Designing a transport system that
continues to rely on fossil-fuel-guzzling automobiles and trucks is not
sustainable. • Crafting a national development plan that raises the
Gross National Product while widening the gap between the rich minority
and the poor majority is not sustainable. • Negotiating a formula for
ending a war that satisfies only the armed men at the table will not
create a sustainable peace. Sustainability, however, is only as positive
as the thing we choose to perpetuate. "[Sustainable patriarchy" sounds
odd, but it is not a contradiction in terms. It simply describes how a
system of ideas and relationships that so many women have risked their
reputations and lives to challenge has, nonetheless, managed to
survive]{.underline}. Describing patriarchy's stubborn survival and its
remarkable adaptability is not to drape it in a mantle of
unassailability. The concept of "sustainable patriarchy" is not intended
to deepen despair or feed resignation. Quite the opposite. [Exposing the
ways patriarchal systems are being perpetuated today will enable us to
more effectively challenge and dismantle them. The ideas and
relationships that comprise any patriarchal system are multiple, but
knowable]{.underline}. They are not mysterious. They are not abstracted
from daily life. Patriarchy is what we live. Patriarchal ideas include
both beliefs (that is, how we explain how the world works) and values
(what we deem is worthy, good, attractive, as well as what we find
unworthy, bad, distasteful). Both can be appealing---and in fact are
appealing, not only to most men, but to a lot of women. That appeal is
one of the things that sustains it. [When we explore what persuaded so
many American women to vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential
election---or to support conservative parties in Britain, Poland, Chile,
Japan, or Australia ---we should think seriously about the appeals and
rewards of patriarchy for diverse women.]{.underline} Patriarchal
beliefs include understandings about whether sex is fixed at birth,
whether gender is synonymous with sex, whether women and men are
"naturally" different, whether maleness is inherently rational, while
femaleness is inherently emotional. [Patriarchal beliefs also include
understandings about whether humans of different races are "naturally"
ranked in a hierarchy, whether the core elements of human societies are
biological families, and whether the world is a dangerous place that
necessitates men acting as the protectors of women]{.underline}.
Patriarchal beliefs include, as well, potent notions of fate and
inevitability. A shrug of one's shoulders can express a belief. In other
words, our beliefs are how we go about making sense of our complex
surroundings and the wider universe in which we live. For instance,
current arguments about transgender people and about climate change have
starkly exposed deeply held conflicting beliefs. Likewise, learning only
now, fifty years after their achievements, that African American women
mathematicians were crucial players in the creation of the US space
program can be unnerving to many people.31 Perhaps our surprise when we
learn this history reveals that, until now, we had believed that Black
women did not have the capabilities to master advanced mathematics.
Patriarchal values are supported by patriarchal beliefs, but are
intended more explicitly to steer behavior. Thus we tend to make values
the topics of our debates among friends, families, and political
parties, even if it is our differing beliefs that ignite the deepest
conflicts with each other. Among the patriarchal values that have been
most contentious are those assigning more worth to reason than to
emotion, those which bestow inherent worth on traditions, and those
which prioritize family loyalty over all other sorts of commitment. [To
rank governments on the basis of whether they are militarily
sophisticated and paternalistically authoritarian towards their citizens
also demonstrates our absorption of patriarchal values. Patriarchal
values often include admiration for what are imagined to be manly forms
of leadership, and, as a patriarchal complement, admiration chiefly for
women who devote themselves first and foremost to
mothering]{.underline}. Thus, to anyone embracing such patriarchal
values, hearing Liberian Leymah Gbowee praised for her successful
mobilization of the Liberian women's peace movement, without any
reference to her behavior as a wife or a mother, can feel uncomfortable.
[Authoritarian values are commonly thought to characterize leaders who
themselves aspire to be authoritarian in their own wielding of power.
Across many cultures, leaders' authoritarian inclinations are
intertwined with their presumed manliness. Contempt for
femininity---even while showing off one's "winning way with women"---is
often coupled with masculinized authoritarian leadership]{.underline}.
This insight is notable in feminist explorations of authoritarianism. No
continent or culture has a monopoly on authoritarian leaders. Zimbabwe's
president, Robert Mugabe, has often been described as a proto-typical
authoritarian ruler. Egypt's former general and current president, Abdel
Fattah el-Sisi, and China's president, Xi Jinping, may sit on top of
quite dissimilar state systems, but both exhibit distinctly
authoritarian modes of leadership. So too does Russian president
Vladimir Putin and his Middle East ally, Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad.32 In 2017, Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, held a
national referendum which narrowly passed a constitutional amendment
that in effect enabled him to wield state power in a more authoritarian
manner. [Of course, women who become leaders can absorb and advocate for
authoritarian values, though the gendered credentials are
distinctive]{.underline}. One thinks of Margaret Thatcher and Indira
Gandhi. Both women were admired for their allegedly masculinized skills.
"The only man in the room," according to each of their male admirers.
[Many American Women's March participants voiced alarm at Donald Trump's
apparent efforts to transform the US presidency into an authoritarian
post]{.underline}. They saw evidence of his valuing a sort of leadership
that was dismissive of the presidency's relationships with co-equal
legislative and court branches. [He appeared to value a sort of
masculinized authority that would not be constrained by the deliberately
complex system of American constitutionalism. To accept such structural
constraints, in his mind, it seemed, bordered on becoming
feminized.]{.underline} It is a mistake, however, to think of
authoritarian values as adhering just to a certain kind of leader.
[Authoritarian values are embraced by those men and women far from the
centers of power who, nonetheless, admire the type of manly leader who
presents himself as "strong." That is, among its followers,
authoritarianism can take the form of submissiveness. The iconic version
of masculinized submission to an authoritarian leader is the "loyal
lieutenant." But there are other masculinized versions as well: the
fawning courtier, the self-interested crony, theaspiring wannabe, the
proverbial "foot soldier." To be an authoritarian voter is to be
someone---of any gender---who yearns for a manly man (or a suitably
masculinized woman) to take firm hold on the reins of power and sweep
away all the frustrating complexities of constitutional checks and
balances]{.underline}. Such a voter hopes that this leader will eschew
the time-consuming give-and-take of democratic debate and compromise. To
absorb authoritarian values in one's role as citizen fosters admiration
for a leader who dismisses the constraints of law and the messiness that
is the characteristic of a genuinely open public arena. Vladimir Putin,
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Donald Trump have each had their fervent
admirers, even when those admirers do not garner direct benefits from
that leader's rule. Though they might imagine themselves to be defiantly
individualistic, these admirers are authoritarian in both the values
they espouse and the relationships in which they take comfort. Values
and beliefs often capture our attention more readily than patriarchal
relationships. Patriarchal relationships have to be minutely observed
over time. That calls for stamina, patience, and attentiveness.
Patriarchal relationships are hard to reveal in a snapshot and only
occasionally appear on a formal organizational chart---X reports to Y,
while Z has the power to promote or fire Y. Most lived relationships are
nuanced. They are made visible not just through speeches, memos,
minutes, punches, gunshots, or exchanges of cash---though trackingeach
of these can be revealing. Relationships are charted by taking careful
note of small gestures, unrecorded silences, and little-noticed
absences. The artful rendition of relationships has drawn thousands of
readers to the novels of Jane Austen and Elena Ferrante. That is why we
binge watch House of Cards and The Crown. [To say that patriarchy has
proved remarkably adaptable is not to argue that there have been no
significant successes in challenging it. Patriarchy would not need to
constantly adapt if those anti-patriarchal successes had not been
achieved.]{.underline} The forcing of men by women to accept their
casting ballots on equal terms with men, in countries as different as
Sweden, South Africa, and Brazil, has compelled patriarchal men and
women to find new ways to ensure the privileging of masculinity in
governance. Similarly, women in countries as disparate as Samoa, Turkey,
and Britain who have managed to drag the practice of wife-beating out of
the domestic shadows, and compel reluctant governments to treat it as a
crime, have motivated patriarchy's adherents to craft new strategies for
intimidating women. [It has been this combination of feminist
achievement and patriarchy's adaptability that has required women's
movements across the world to keep reinventing themselves]{.underline}.
To grapple with an adaptable patriarchy takes time, energy, and ever
more diverse alliances. Patriarchy's beneficiaries count on us getting
tired. Patriarchal systems---those dynamic webs of beliefs, values, and
relationships---have to be able to adapt in ways that make them look
new, reformed, "up-to-date," occasionally even revolutionary. Their
advocates have to perform these repeated facelifts while sustaining
patriarchy's essential core: the privileging of particular forms of
masculinity over despised masculinities and over all forms of
femininity. [A few select women can be let into the boardroom---or onto
the television sportscast or into the law school---but on (usually
unwritten and denied) conditions: that those few women do not insist
that many more women of diverse races join them; that those allowed
inside internalize masculinized ways of thinking (about profits, war,
sexuality, inequality); or, by contrast, that those few selected women
act out a form of patriarchal femininity that complements but does not
supplant masculinized privilege. There is an alternative process for
perpetuating patriarchal beliefs, values, and relationships, which is to
turn what used to be a site of masculinized privilege into a site of
feminized marginalization]{.underline}. The classic example is bank
clerking. In Dickens's time, to be a bank clerk was to be a respectable
manly man with a foot on the lower rung of the patriarchal ladder; by
the early twenty-first century, bank clerking has become feminized and
the ladder leads nowhere.33 Similarly, the anchoring of television news
programs used to be an exclusively male job. It, too, has been feminized
in many countries in ways that have sucked much of the authority out of
the position. [Likewise, military male commanders deciding that certain
once-masculinized roles could be feminized, without risking the
reputation of the military as a site for men to prove their manliness,
is as old as uniformed female soldiers serving as secretaries for male
officers.]{.underline} Recently, for example, the US military has taken
steps to replace male soldiers with female soldiers at war zone
checkpoints. Women are under-represented in all but two of the world's
national legislatures, those of Bolivia and Rwanda.34 They are making
gains, however, at the same time as many governments, in the name of
"anti-terrorism," are investing more power in their security officials.
[It may not be fantastical, then, to wonder if one day elected
legislators will become so powerless that patriarchs will encourage the
feminization of legislatures, while real power will be wielded by men
(and a few select women) occupying masculinized posts atop the treasury,
the military, and the security and intelligence agencies.]{.underline}

### Language

#### Gendered language sustains patriarchy---it conceals gendered violence to prop up patriarchal systems

Patriarchy." The Big Push Exposing and Challenging the Persistence of
Patriarchy. University of California Press. Pp 47. LJS

[It is worth pausing here to take a second look at language.
Independently from the practice of patriarchy, the very choice of
language can perpetuate patriarchal beliefs.]{.underline} Commonly used
by officials of international agencies and governments, as well as by
staffers of nongovernmental human rights and humanitarian aid
organizations, many of whom are dedicated to improving girls' and
women's lives, this familiar phrase, "child marriages," may be helping
to sustain patriarchy. How does this work? ["Child marriages" implies
that boys as well as girls are offered up in marriage by their parents
while they are still minors. This is true. However, by adopting the
phrase "child marriages" one is suggesting that boys are just as likely
as girls to be married while still in their childhood, and this is not
true]{.underline}. For instance, researchers for UNICEF concluded, in
their detailed 2016 report A Study on Early Marriage in Jordan, 2014,
that, among both Jordanian children and Syrian refugee children living
in Jordan, less than even one half of one percent of the children
married were boys. [That is, in reality, these are not "child
marriages." They are girl marriages. Each of us helps to sustain
patriarchal ideas and practices when we hide the workings of gendered
inequities behind a curtain of ungendered language. And, when we hide
patriarchy, we are sustaining it.]{.underline}

### Violence

#### Military masculinity causes violence---pathological violence becomes an assertion of masculinity

**Partis-Jennings 17** (Hannah Partis-Jennings research focuses on
gender, performance, and spatial practice in liberal peace paradigms and
her PhD, from the University of St Andrews, focused specifically on
Afghanistan where she conducted field research in 2014**, "**Military
Masculinity and the Act of Killing in Hamlet and Afghanistan." Men and
Masculinities. 2019; 22(2): 254-272. doi:10.1177/1097184X17718585) -SAJ

[A key factor that polices military masculinity is the possibility of
gendered shame befalling those who cannot live up to a masculine ideal.
The word shame is indebted]{.underline} 10 [Men and
Masculinities]{.underline} XX(X) [to terms meaning "to cover, to veil,
to hide" which is indicative of its impact on individuals]{.underline}
(Pattison 2000, 40). [When shamed, we physically and mentally withdraw.
We feel undone, cripplingly self-conscious, debilitating aware of our
own perceived inadequacy, and totally unable to manage the impact of
that awareness]{.underline} (p. 41). [Crucially, shame is so viscerally
and emotionally powerful that it shuts down cognition. Shame is anathema
to considered thought, to processes of thinking, and therefore to moral
deliberation. Moreover, shame gathers momentum, if reiterated and
referred to habitually, and in cultural discourse, it can produce a
sustained feeling of urgency]{.underline}. There is a need to rectify
the imbalance felt in ones sense of self, to eliminate shame via
"hyperbolic displays of agency" manifesting in aggression or violence
(Mann 2014, 41, 117). Nussbaum (2004) and Jordan (1989) note that [shame
denies the possibility of empathy]{.underline}. Mann goes a step further
and argues that [in order to banish shame, there is a need to humiliate
others, to practice violence upon them in order to reassert the broken
sense of self]{.underline} (2014, 117, 124). [Shame taps into the
deepest roots of identity structures, and therefore, unsurprisingly, it
can have strongly gendered implications and causes. Feminist scholars
have pointed to the role of basic military training in generating
gendered shame]{.underline} (Goldstein 2001; Whitworth 2004). [If a male
soldier is perceived as weak, failing, or overly thoughtful, he is
associated with the feminine.]{.underline} [He is a "pussy," a "faggot,"
a "little bitch"]{.underline} (Mann 2014, 212). [His gendered identity
becomes vulnerable, the notion of the feminine becomes a weapon, which
can disrupt his most personal sense of self-worth.]{.underline} In the
audio recording of the Marine A incident, the [soldiers refer to their
enemy as a "cunt," an expletive which, similar to "fuck"]{.underline}
(also used by the soldiers), [has a specifically gendered
connotation]{.underline} (McKinnon 1989, 4). [This word seems to
function as the visceral expression of disgust at the feminine; the
attempt to expel or purge the female, for the soldiers to force gendered
shame upon the enemy Other.]{.underline} Mann argues that [shame in the
masculine domain provokes the feminization of others in an attempt for
the shamed subject(s) to recover their sense of self]{.underline}
(2014). The actions of Marine A can therefore be understood as a product
of gendered shame, abstracted through the cultural and behavioral
framework of military training and practice (Sasson-Levy 2003). [A
gendered "shame-to-power conversion]{.underline}"4 (Mann 2014, 131--40)
[by the soldiers is visible in the feminizing and killing of the
injured]{.underline} Afghan insurgent; Marine A manifests the desire to
control his identity in an uncontrollable context, [to regain agency by
denying agency to the Other, shaming him, dehumanizing him, committing
violence against him, and in doing so striving to regain some semblance
of the promised military masculine power]{.underline} (Mann 2014;
Richter-Montpetit 2007; Welland 2013[). Scholars have pointed out that
behavioral expectations generated by military masculinities are becoming
disconnected from actual soldiering tasks]{.underline}. As
RichterMontpetit argues, citing Whitworth, this [disconnect renders
masculine identities in the military "inherently fragile."]{.underline}
There are "discrepancies between the myth/ promise-fueled expectations
fostered in military training on the one hand, and the Partis-Jennings
11 unstable and uncontrollable reality of war on the other"
(Richter-Montpetit 2007, 45). Duncanson writes about [peacekeeper
masculinity as a modification of the traditional military masculine
framework to include more previously feminized tasks]{.underline} (2013,
95). Similarly, Welland (2013) argues that asexuality and discipline are
hard won myths through which the [homosocial behavior and feminized
tasks of soldiering are obfuscated. These frameworks signal the
adaptation of masculine identity structures in the face of the shifting
conduct and requirements of war that often include peace-related
activities and population engagement]{.underline} (Duncanson 2013; Paris
2013). However, [there is an inherent tension in the ability of
individuals to adapt to "softer" tasks]{.underline} (like peacekeeping)
[and to reconcile their ideas and expectations about militarized
masculine practice with the situations they find themselves in and the
tasks they perform]{.underline} (Duncanson 2013; Welland 2013). There is
often a sense that [soldiers are trained to be masculine and then
paradoxically expected to carry out feminized activities]{.underline}
(Welland 2013). The [military masculinities]{.underline} which Mann
(2014, 125) argues [are fostered in basic training through gendered
shaming require an outlet, yet the possibilities for banishing this
shame through demonstrations of military masculinity are becoming more
restricted and more confused in the modern, hybridized, and regulated
military climate. Violent outbursts are hardly pathological in this
context, but the logical corollary of the logic of war which relies on
contradictions, psychological pressures, and Othering]{.underline}
(Welland 2013). [The relationship between gendered shame, acts of
violence/killing]{.underline} (such as in the Marine A case), and
military masculinity can be further elucidated by looking at the
parallels between this context and Hamlet's. The notion of femininity is
deeply connected to ideas around shame, humiliation, and original sin in
Hamlet (Adelman 1992). For Adelman, what Hamlet battles in the text is
the shameful "subjection of male to female" inherent in his inability to
act decisively, and she argues that the whole story is centered on
combatting the contamination of the feminine. This echoes Cohn and
Weber's point that military praxis requires a "purging of the feminine"
(Cohn 1999, 462). Thus, the aesthetic of gendered shame and preemptive
gender crisis that Hamlet demonstrates offers an insightful parallel
into the dangerous psychological consequences of the required
"shame-to-power conversion" in military masculinities (Mann 2014,
131--40). [Through this aesthetic lens, pathological acts of violence
committed by soldiers can be seen as a way of trying to regain ownership
of the gendered self; an attempt to banish shame and the linked
possibility of being contaminated by femininity. The Marine A incident
might not have been understood as gendered, but as mentioned above, one
of the justifications for his actions offered by a fellow soldier was
that the British feel feminized and weak in Afghanistan and must try to
emulate or equal what he called "Taliban masculinity" (Terrill 2014).
These gendered parallels between Marine A and Hamlet thus require us to
contemplate the effects of institutional destabilization of gender
identity and of forcing soldiers to prove their gender and thus
selfhood, according to the unattainable and unrealistic parameters
characteristic of the logic of war.]{.underline}

#### Reinforcing masculinity makes violence a necessity---war becomes an inevitable to assert the masculine hero image

**Partis-Jennings 17** (Hannah Partis-Jennings research focuses on
gender, performance, and spatial practice in liberal peace paradigms and
her PhD, from the University of St Andrews, focused specifically on
Afghanistan where she conducted field research in 2014**, "**Military

pg.13)-SAJ

In Hamlet , there is a particular power associated with the performance
of mur- der---Hamlet arranges a play version of his father's murder in
order to confirm his suspicions about the culprits---but it is also a
display of bravado. The play is the means through which Hamlet makes
Claudius afraid, through which he tries to demonstrate his capacity to
avenge his father like a real man. Performance here is gendered; Hamlet
uses theatricality to demonstrate and justify his own capacity and
desire to kill and to fulfill his gendere d filial duty (Shakespeare
2007, 1952-- 56). The video/audio recording of Marine A shooting t he
insurgent is also notable for its theatricality. Not only is the use o f
the Shakespeare quote performative in and of itself, but the whole scene
demonstrates a strange staginess. This was noted in the BBC documentary
where one marin e commented that Marine A was putting on an act of
bravado highly common in the context of war. He suggested that it is an
"air of drama that comes with command a bit of bravado" (Terrill
2014).Arguably, [the performance of hypermasculine aggression and
callous detachment is a mechanism for leadership in the military, a way
to show those in your command that gender is on your side, and that like
a real military man, you have the situation under control. Performance
is an undertheorized but vital component of warfare]{.underline} (see
Higate and Henry 2009), and the fact that Hamlet uses a theatrical
production to frighten his enemy resonates with modern war practice.
Mann (2014) points out that [soldiers often fight because they are
embarrassed not to be seen as brave and masculine in a gendered theatre.
Performance is vital for attempting to display masculine bravado, to
banish fear through pretense and drama, and thus is significant first at
the individual level, yet also by its very nature transcends this level
of significance.]{.underline} An examination of performativity is a
central tenet of meaning within an aesthetic methodology and
intertextual analysis. Bauman and Briggs state that performances move
various discursive components "into a reflexive arena where they can be
examined critically" (1990, 60). Thus, "[performative infrastructure"
(particularly in war) is the locus where "meanings are produced,
identities constituted, social relations established"; yet on a more
universal scale, it also allows for "political and ethical outcomes \[to
be\]\... made more or less possible"]{.underline} (Bialasiewicz et al.
2007: 406, 415). Hamlet uses performance to move his father's murder
from suspicion to reality, from internal to public, and from personal to
political (the play is staged in the Royal Court); "\[p\]erformance puts
the act of speaking on display---objectifies it, lifts it to a degree
from its interactional setting and opens it to scrutiny by an audience"
(Bauman and Briggs 1990, 73). [The act of violence committed by Marine A
was made visible by the accidental recording on his fellow soldier's
head camera and remains visible through media representation and online
advocacy such as the website JFMA.5 These mediated performances of
killing are defined by the masculine aesthetic of war.]{.underline} The
performance of murder in Hamlet is meta-theatrical, meaning it is a play
within a play and equally the audio recording of the incident functions
as a performance, a piece of drama available for public consumption yet
it simultaneously exists within the wider performance of a nation at
war. [Thus, even as a singular act, it must necessarily signal the
deeply political, structurally gendered consequences of states anctioned
killing. If the audio recording on YouTube is understood as a play
within a play, the politically constituted framing of war is the larger
piece of gendered aesthetics and theatricality (Mann 2006).]{.underline}
The citational expression, evoking Hamlet, contributes to a particular
aesthetic event and "aesthetic events register a double moment, which,
at its most basic, is both a destabilizing aesthetic or performative
experience where thought is made strange to itself and a moment of
reflection on the aesthetic, political or ethical consequences of this
experience" (L. Frost 2010, 436). [The combined performativity of the
Hamlet quote and the framing of Marine A's fate as tragic on the website
JFMA evoke a heroic military masculinity through a tragic
aesthetic]{.underline}. Aristotle argues in the Poetics that a tragic
hero provokes pity and fear, pity because of this tragic fate and fear
because his fate could have belonged to any other (Erskine and Lebow
2012, 3). [JFMA seeks to draw upon the pity and fear that resonate with
a tragic aesthetic by portraying Marine A as a kind of heroic everyman.
He is a masculine character, and his love of sport (a manly pursuit)
particularly rugby and swimming (in which he achieved a "life-saving
certificate") is hugely emphasized; he is depicted as normal guy with a
mum and dad, who loves his nieces and nephews and squeezes in a round of
golf when he can]{.underline}. Equally, his extraordinary military
masculine heroism is highlighted on the JFMA Facebook page,6 which
proclaims slogans such as "Never Was So Much Owed By So Many" and "He
Put His Life on the Line for Us" in posters of Marine A. JFMA seeks to
emphasize in the Marine A incident, the presence of an impossible
ethical choice as set out by the core of a tragic dilemma. The home page
of the website has only one sentence of content text: "Sgt Alexander
Blackman has been sentenced to 8 years to life for allegedly killing a
Taliban insurgent who moments before was trying to kill him and the men
under his command." [Implicit in this sentence is the same sentiment
expressed by those who commented under the YouTube audio: war is war and
the ethics of life and death are not the same in war.]{.underline}
Erskine and Lebow suggest that "an appreciation of tragedy . . . has the
potential to inform our thinking about the perceived dilemmas that arise
in war when there appear to be multiple, conflicting obligations and,
therefore, no obvious right course of action" (2012, 11). [JFMA taps
into this idea, reiterating the notion of the fog of war and the
allegiance of a soldier to his country as legitimizing action that may
otherwise be understood as wrongful killing.]{.underline} A central
ethical difference between Greek and Shakespearean tragedy is the
reduction of the role of fate and the centrality of individual moral
responsibility in the latter (Erskine and Lebow 2012, 5). Even as
Hamlet, just as JFMA's narrative, "illustrates how complex and
contradictory the ethical imperatives that make their demands on us
are," it is this personal moral responsibility for killing which
paralyses Hamlet as he contemplates his enemy's humanity (M. Frost 2012,
31[). The question of moral responsibility starkly pursued through a
murder trial and judgment destabilizes the tragic aesthetic
of]{.underline} JFMA and those who support Marine A as [a militarized
masculine hero killing bravely in the name of war, yet they also make
the story a tragic narrative in the first place by signaling seemingly
incompatible ethical frameworks]{.underline} (civilian law and war time
actions). The aesthetic lens through which Marine A and Hamlet are
linked across worlds brings to bear a contemplation of wider complicity
in Marine A's actions, [confronting the public domain with its own
framing, marking the killing as a political act, and elucidating the
fact that "what is considered legitimate and controlled violence, or
illegitimate and uncontrolled violence is not always so
'neat'"]{.underline} (Welland 2013, 899). It is evident in the words of
the YouTube comments, the JFMA website, and supporter sentiments in the
BBC documentary that [military masculinity provides a safe space through
which to rationalize death, killing, and relational vulnerability, to
make it easier to consume a moment of ethical confusion and violence
brought about through the actions of a legitimate state at
war.]{.underline} The depiction of Marine A as a tragic masculine hero
is both inverted and supported by the most direct reference to a tragic
hero in the entire incident---an intertextual evocation of Hamlet who is
perhaps one of culture's most famous tragic heroes. In other words, this
evocation shines a light on both Marine A's lack of ethical
contemplation and inhumanity and the fundamentally difficult,
violence-oriented conditions and mode of interpretation in which his act
is situated, in which we are all complicit and for which he alone cannot
be to blame. This citational instant [draws both parallels and
distinctions that are gendered and relational, rendering a killing in
Afghanistan visible in a different light through an aesthetic lens and
equally illustrating that it has wider gendered and political
significance.]{.underline}

### Solvency -- Epistemology

#### Feminist interventions in IR are key to breaking down binaries that cause conflict and decolonizing knowledge itself within academic settings

**McLeod & O'Reilly 19**

Laura, lecturer in International Politics at the University of
Manchester, UK; O'Reilly, lecturer in Politics and International
Relations at Leeds Beckett University, UK. "Critical peace and conflict

[Critical PCS comes under fire for reinforcing binaries -- such as
local/international; everyday/exceptional; male/female -- and for
perpetuating hierarchies between lay/ expert forms of
knowledge]{.underline}. The articles in this special issue of
Peacebuilding all draw on feminist theory, epistemology, and/or
methodology to highlight their implications for how we might critically
analyse and reflect upon peacebuilding practice. [One key insight is
that feminist approaches open the way for a less binary, more nuanced
approach to PCS]{.underline}. Stefanie Kappler and Nicolas Lemay-Hébert
explore this in relation to hybridity, the everyday, and narratives --
key areas of PCS research which may reaffirm binaries and power
hierarchies if approached without care. Kappler and Lemay-Hébert
introduce an 'intersectionality of peace' approach to prompt a broader
understanding of power relations as they are lived and experienced on
the ground by a variety of actors (including researchers and
peacebuilding interveners). [They show that feminist understandings of
intersectionality, firstly, enable an exploration of hybrid identities
without (re)producing common dichotomies; secondly, allow the complex
power dynamics operating within everyday dimensions of peacebuilding
interventions to be unpacked; and, finally, support an approach to
narrative analysis which identifies structural inequalities. This has
implications for how we analyse peace in theory and practice, pushing us
to overcome rigid binaries (such as local/international, us/them,
male/female), and to challenge discursive and material structures of
domination which pervade (post-)conflict settings. One reason that
feminist perceptions help to destabilise binary boundaries the emphasis
of feminist research practice upon reflexivity]{.underline}.88 Feminist
researchers recognise that 'the selection of research questions and . .
. the development of (new) research practices' are among the areas
'where feminist insights can make their biggest impact'.89 In this
Special Issue, Catherine Baker explores how young people engage with
popular music in Croatia, Rachel Julian, Berit Bliesemann de Guevara and
Robin Redhead examine artistic expressions of silenced voices in
Myanmar, and Hannah PartisJennings asks questions about the
manifestations of the 'third-gender' in Afghanistan. These articles, and
others in this Special Issue, emphasise emancipatory and participatory
forms of research across a range of very different post-conflict
contexts. [Such approaches allow researchers to break down barriers
between private and public aspects of peace.]{.underline} They enable
scholars to tap into voices, culture and community that often remain
hidden or unappreciated by existing approaches to PCS, and can introduce
everyday experiences of conflict and peace that are not frequently
captured. [By recentring on ideas about emancipation and participation,
feminist methodologies can be deployed to subvert and address gendered
power relations shaping the practice of research in PCS.]{.underline}
Key to the self-reflexivity of feminist research is to raise 'new
ethical and political dilemmas that expand methodological inquiry'.90
Again, all the articles in the Special Issue do this in one way or
another. In particular, Julian et al explore the effects of
methodological choice in their investigation of the 'Raising Silent
Voices' project in Myanmar. [They note that feminist epistemology
prompted them to foreground the experiential knowledge of 'ordinary
people' in conflict situations. Such knowledge, they contend, is
essential for understanding the social world and should be placed at
centre of analysis]{.underline}. The authors demonstrate how
experiential knowledge can be gathered with arts-based methodologies. In
doing so, they highlight the importance of knowledge about
conflict/peace being produced from standpoint of women and marginalised
others whose experiences are so often written out. They argue that this
involves reworking and contesting hierarchical power relations between
'researched' and 'researcher'. In recognising that knowledge is produced
intersubjectively, the authors note the importance of 'raising silent
voices' (and indeed of the silence) of those who have experienced war.
In doing so, they make a compelling case for the value of feminist
insights for PCS research. Embodiment, experience and sensory
perceptions Feminism has much to offer in terms of understanding that
spaces between conflict and peace are all lived, embodied experiences.
[A key contribution of feminism to critical PCS is the nuanced sensory
perception that feminist analysis offers.]{.underline} This arises out
of several key feminist insights about the personal, about bodies, and
about experience. While not all feminist work explicitly refers to
senses, sensory perceptions shape feminist research, analysis and
writing. This is because making sense of the human social experience
requires us to draw on bodily senses. We cannot know about the world
without seeing, hearing, touching, smelling or tasting. Senses are
crucial data for perceiving the world, and how you use your senses
affects how you interact and make sense of the world. [Realising that
senses are data is a powerful realisation: data are bits of information
that we put together -- but how do we access that information? Through
our senses]{.underline}. Likewise, processes of conflict and peace are
encountered/perceived through the senses -- indeed, the common phrases
used to describe war refer to senses, e.g. the cry for war/peace; sight
of suffering; touch of violence/care; smell of death/disease; the taste
of victory (sweet) or defeat (bitter). [This means that developing a
nuanced sensory perception of the world is crucial to better
understanding the processes and practice of international
peacebuilding.]{.underline} Catherine Baker, in this Special Issue,
explores how young people engage with (listen to, sing) popular music in
post-conflict Croatia to provide insights into how understandings of
everyday peace are contested. By exploring how gendered and racialised
constructs are attached to and detached from material bodies within
audio-visual media, she shows how feminist and aesthetic approaches can
help critical PCS reach a deeper understanding of the affective politics
of post-conflict masculinities. [Sensory explorations are a powerful
reminder of how the personal is political: apparently personal, private,
'merely' social aspects of daily life (such as popular music heard and
listened to by teenagers) are 'in fact infused with power' and so are
intensely political.91 There are important connections to be made
between sensory perceptions, bodies and experience, which may open the
way for a more nuanced analysis within PCS.]{.underline} Feminist
scholars make gendered bodies and corporeality central to critical PCS.
[This begins from the premise that it is necessary to avoid adding
'women' as an essentialised category to analyses of peace and conflict.
Rather, as noted earlier, gender as an analytical category needs to be
contextualised, conceptualised and analysed in all its messy, glorious
complexity]{.underline}. The contributions in this Special Issue do this
in various ways. Tarja Väyrynen argues against abstract and theoretical
understandings of peace, pointing to the significance of vulnerability
and corporeality in comprehending how peace is expressed through
situated, embodied encounters. Tiina Vaittinen, Amanda Donahoe, Rahel
Kunz, Silja Bára Ómarsdóttir and Sanam Roohi suggest that placing
feminist understandings of care and of everyday peace at the forefront
of critical PCS debates on the 'local turn' would significantly expand
understandings of how peace emerges in theory and practice. Vaittinen et
al spotlight the vital contributions offered by gendered relations of
care and of caring towards the construction of everyday peace. As they
show, these relations are invaluable, yet are frequently neglected by
critical analyses of peace. The articles by Väyrynen and by Vaittinen et
al demonstrate that corporeality can give greater texture and depth to
the role that gendered power relations play in the shift towards
'post-liberal peace'. The feminist interest in corporeality has no doubt
emerged out of a wariness 'of any attempts to link women's
subjectivities and social positions to the specifics of their bodies'.-
92 [As noted earlier in this introduction, critical PCS tends to view
gender as a problem, or an issue to solve (rather than a critical lens
on the world). A feminist perspective about corporeality enables us to
think about how bodies have an ability to 'extend the frameworks which
contain them'.93]{.underline} The ramifications of this insight is
powerfully made in this Special Issue by Hannah Partis-Jennings, who
explores the use of the 'third gender' by international peacebuilders
working in Afghanistan. By developing a framework of gendered hybridity,
Partis-Jennings demonstrates how bodies and performances of female
internationals adopting and/or assigned the category of the third
gender, is central to understanding how actors perform and shape peace
promotion at the everyday level. [This article is a valuable addition to
a growing body of scholarship on hybridity -- which highlights how a
feminist perspective can prompt a more complex set of questions about
the gendered dynamics between local and international actors and how
that shapes and produces gender in the practice and process of
post-conflict reconstruction.94]{.underline} Decolonising the concepts
and methods of PCS [Critical scholarship has been criticised for its
propensity to recreate rather than adequately challenge the hierarchies,
binaries, and exclusions of mainstream scholarship.95]{.underline}
Bennett and Watson, for example, note 'a lack of real engagement' with
local stakeholders plus a failure of 'white middle class Western
researchers' to reflect on their positionality and privilege and its
impact on relationships with research participants.96 Sabaratnam
highlights a tendency to disregard or downplay the agency and
subjectivity of societies and communities targeted by liberal
interventionism, despite critical scholars claiming to search for
'local', 'everyday', or 'subaltern' understandings of peace.[97 There is
an urgent need to decolonise PCS research by challenging neo-colonial
modes of knowledge production.]{.underline} We do not claim that
feminist scholarship has entirely escaped Eurocentric assumptions. We
acknowledge that the authors in this Special Issue are in the main white
scholars situated in the Global North. Furthermore, as Heidi Hudson
points out, 'the exploration of gender and decoloniality in relation to
peacebuilding remains underrepresented and undertheorised, with the
literature focussed on gender and coloniality generally'.98
[Nevertheless, we contend that feminist scholarship is an invaluable
source for critical scholars engaging with many of the difficult
theoretical issues, methodological challenges, and ethical dilemmas
involved in undertaking 'decolonial' research.]{.underline} Feminist
research aims to build 'non-exploitative relationships within research'
by paying attention to the significance of gender whilst attending to
the intersections between sexism, racism, heteronormativity, classism,
and so on.99 [Central to this is the understanding that research
relationships are shot through with dynamic, shifting, yet hierarchical
relations of power.100]{.underline} Thinking about the complexity of
power relations in relation to gender and decoloniality is crucial for
thinking about 'local' and 'everyday' in analyses of peacebuilding.
Making sense of how to use global peacebuilding architectures (such as
the WPS resolutions) in local contexts requires us to draw upon feminist
ideas about the local, the everyday, and lived experience.101 [Feminists
have long argued that 'gender analysis offers a bottom-up foundational
logic' which may counter the ways that liberal peacebuilding projects
masks disparities between a range of civil society
actors.102]{.underline} Building on these ideas, in this Special Issue,
Tarja Väyrynen draws on a long heritage of feminist peace research about
everyday embodied experiences to develop a construct of 'eventness'.
Through 'eventness' she highlights how to bring peace back to the lives
of ordinary people, seeking to expose the radical potential embedded in
the everyday by recognising the spectacular within the ordinary. [Part
of decolonising PCS includes considering the ways that scholarship and
research practices continue to perpetuate the colonial and Eurocentric
nature of academia itself.103]{.underline} This awareness was especially
heightened around the 'Sapphire Series' panels at the International
Studies Association (ISA) annual conference in 2015, where the showpiece
panels created by ISA were all-white scholars situated in the Global
North.104 [Feminist approaches to research and scholarship can support
decolonising the academy. To achieve this, researchers often 'engage
creative strategies and a range of traditional and contemporary media as
resources through which the subaltern speaks in varied social and
community contexts'.105]{.underline} In this Special Issue, the articles
by Julian et al, Väyrynen, and Baker all do this via making use of the
visual arts to 'raise silent voices', personal vignettes to highlight
the significance of the mundane, and audio-visual media taken from a
video-sharing website to problematise masculinities. As noted, the very
practice of academic scholarship also needs decolonising. Feminists have
sought to address this. One article in this Special Issue -- by
Vaittinen et al -- was the product of Feminist Peace Research Network
meetings organised by the Universities of Tampere, Lund and Tromsø
during 2016--17.106 This international, interdisciplinary network brings
together feminist PCS researchers from both Global South and North, as
well as from academic and practitioner backgrounds. One of the network's
innovative practices was to group participants with similar research
interests from across the Global North and South to develop a
co-authored paper.107 The impetus behind this was to build a research
network celebrating diverse lived experiences and to strengthen
collaborations across research communities. [Both critical and feminist
PCS scholars might develop similar collaborative research practices in
order to democratise knowledge production within PCS and challenge
institutions and practices that maintain injustice.]{.underline}

While defining 'feminist PCS research' is contentious, and indeed, there
are various ways and extents to which scholarship can be feminist, [we
take the view that feminist PCS research seeks to develop and apply
feminist theory and/or methodology to produce insights about issues of
peace and conflict. Feminist approaches, while varied, understand gender
as a concept or category that must be unpacked and engaged with to make
sense of why conflict emerges and how peace can/should be
built.]{.underline} Feminist PCS shares many commonalities with critical
PCS scholarship, as we outline below.2 Both represent alternative
approaches to the positivist research agenda that dominates mainstream
PCS. Like critical PCS, [feminist PCS]{.underline} research [aims to
achieve positive social change, by critiquing dominant ideologies and
methodologies of building peace that (re)produce inequalities of power
along lines of gender, race/ethnicity, nationality, class, sexuality,
dis/ability, and so on.]{.underline} Both schools tend towards bottom-up
methodologies [that place lived experience at the centre of the research
proces]{.underline}s. However, unlike critical scholarship, [feminist
PCS research is characterised by an explicitly feminist commitment,
firstly, to identify the androcentric nature of PCS, and, secondly, to
challenge the tendency of mainstream and critical PCS researchers to
ignore, minimise, or marginalise the perspectives of women, girls, and
non-binary people, and/or the category of gender in their
analyses.]{.underline} That said, it is impossible to talk of 'critical
PCS' and 'feminist PCS' as coherent entities that talk at odds with each
other. We do not seek to develop a grand definition of what constitutes
feminist or critical PCS -- both are very diverse fields, and this is to
be celebrated. Acknowledging that there is much slippage, in this
Special Issue we aim to illustrate and make this slippage explicit,
while demonstrating what is different when feminist scholars intervene
in PCS. This introductory article proceeds in three parts. First, we
unpack the key concepts underpinning this Special Issue, making explicit
why we feel a feminist intervention is necessary. Second, we chart the
connections between critical and feminist approaches to PCS, via an
investigation of the 'four generations' of PCS scholarship.3 [Our
analysis highlights that: (a) the marginalisation of feminist ideas is a
continual thread throughout the development of PCS, and (b) although the
'fourth' generation (critical PCS) has taken some inspiration from
feminist scholars, there remain opportunities for deeper
conversations]{.underline}. Third, we highlight the three key
contributions that a feminist intervention into critical PCS achieves:
(1) [Feminist theory, epistemology and methodology is a rich resource,
opening way for a less binary, more nuanced approach to
PCS]{.underline}. (2) Feminist analysis encourages a nuanced sensory
perception of peace and conflict, following several key feminist
insights about the significance of the personal, of embodiment, and of
experience. (3) [Efforts to decolonise the modes of knowledge production
within PCS cannot be fully realised without incorporating a feminist
critique of concepts such as 'the local' and 'the everyday' which are
currently at the heart of critical PCS scholarship.]{.underline} For us,
these three reasons begin to address what is different when feminist
scholars contend with issues of peace and conflict. These represent
three key contributions of a feminist intervention into critical PCS,
which is explored further throughout this Special Issue. Finally, the
article concludes by outlining suggestions for how to foster a more
effective dialogue between these fields. Feminism is provocative, and we
do not want to pin it -- feminism -- down and define it. Sara Ahmed
[think]{.underline}s [of feminism as 'homework', because 'we have so
much to work out from not being at home in a world']{.underline} (2017,
7). As feminists, we do not always feel at 'home' within critical PCS. A
paper about feminism presented at a conference sometimes leads to an
awkward silence. Why? Sara Ahmed's insight that ['when you expose a
problem you pose a problem' comes to mind.4 Or perhaps it is because
'nonfeminist scholars seem convinced that feminist knowledge does not
concern them -- a feeling reproduced by a common understanding that
feminism is only about "identity politics" or "women's stuff"'. 5 This
provokes us to wonder if there has been a wilful blindness and
marginalisation of the potential and actual contributions of feminist
scholarship]{.underline} by many working in critical PCS. As stated,
this Special Issue seeks to demonstrate that [feminist approaches are
vital to achieving a subtle and nuanced analysis of key
issues]{.underline} [in PCS]{.underline}. [Paying serious attention to a
wide range of feminist scholarship would highlight useful insights for
peacebuilding policy and practice, make stronger efforts to decolonise
PCS, and develop a nuanced sensory analysis within PCS
scholarship]{.underline}. It is useful to [distinguish between the terms
women, gender, and feminism.]{.underline} It might seem obvious, but
'women' relates to a biological sex. 'Gender' typically refers to
socially constructed understandings of bodies and how they behave.
Gender is a contested and slippery concept. It may be best understood as
a 'category developed to explore what counts as "woman" and as "man"'. 6
Gender recognises that [masculinity and femininity are culturally and
socially constructed and are analytically different to categories such
as male/female, boy/girl, which are (problematically) deployed to
establish a sexual difference based upon bodily characteristics. Like
gender, 'feminism is tricky to define, and we do not wish to police what
does or does not count as being feminist. Broadly, feminism may be
understood as a political orientation and ideological movement geared
towards the transformation of gendered power relations. These ideas
about transformation are often informed by concepts such as inequality,
patriarchy, misogyny, androcentricism, and sexism.]{.underline}
'Intervention' is a word that we use often in PCS. International
intervention. Humanitarian intervention. Statebuilding interventions.
Intervention can be understood as being intrusive. Marysia Zalewski
notes that [feminism's presence in International Relations (IR) is an
'explicitly gendered figure', where the shape of arrival is seen as 'an
intruder's knowledge', where 'feminism's presence seemingly naturally
requires explanation, justification and evaluation]{.underline}'. 7 Our
experience is that PCS has been similar. We deliberately chose to title
this Special Issue 'Feminist Interventions' because we wanted to
intervene into a field stridently, and to point out what needed to be
thought about differently. Our intervention is staged because we are
concerned that there is a tendency within critical scholarship to engage
with many concepts -- hybridity, agency, the everyday, friction, the
local, participation, and narratives -- without paying attention to
feminist insights. As the authors in this Special Issue demonstrate,
many of these concepts have deep feminist roots, stretching back
decades. These roots are rarely acknowledged. Additionally, throughout
the Special Issue, authors have sought to demonstrate the ways in which
[feminist ideas can push us to rethink key concepts, approaches, and
methods]{.underline} in contemporary PCS. It is not that feminism is a
new approach to PCS, but rather, that [the moment is ripe for a
sustained feminist intervention, given the increasing use of popular

The Big Push Exposing and Challenging the Persistence of Patriarchy.

[It can be easy to slip into the sanguine notion that time itself
creates positive change]{.underline}. Back then, systematic rape wasn't
considered a war crime. Back then, women journalists were relegated to
the paper's Style page. Back then, factory bosses could lock garment
workers inside their unsafe factories. [Phrasing it this way makes each
change appear as though it didn't take analyzing, organizing and
risk-taking by scores of diverse women and their male allies in scores
of different societies to achieve even small advances. All it took to
roll back patriarchy was the mere passage of time. It is perhaps this
optimism---a faith in the passage of time to create progress---that
fueled my own too-easy presumption in 2013 that, after two decades of
directing my attention elsewhere, when I revisited arenas in the
globalized political economy I would find patriarchy in
retreat]{.underline}. I was in for a surprise. Patriarchy is not reliant
on just one or two attitudes that feminists have needed to
challenge---for instance, that daughters are worth less parental
investment than sons, or that men make better scientists than
women---though, of course, those attitudes do indeed have to be altered
if patriarchy is to be dismantled. Patriarchy is not even reliant on
just a few relationships that feminists have had to transform---for
example, men being given unlimited sexual access to their wives; or
women being positioned in organizations as the loyal assistants to their
male bosses. [Though, again, transforming these patriarchal
relationships has been a monumental task, which so many advocates of
women's rights have taken on their shoulders. Patriarchy is a particular
complex web of both attitudes and relationships that position women and
men, girls and boys in distinct and unequal categories, that value
particular forms of masculinity over virtually all forms of femininity,
and---and this is crucial---that ensure that men who fulfill these
favored forms of manliness will be able to assert control over most
women. In other words, patriarchy is wide and it is deep. It is
distinct, but it feeds off both racism and classism.]{.underline}
Patriarchy's workings are not automatically rejected by women and girls.
There are many rewards bestowed on a woman who finds ways to fit into a
patriarchal system: marital economic security, societal respectability;
even, occasionally, state honors. The woman who does not rebel against
patriarchy will be complimented on her beauty, on her femininity, on her
loyalty (as a daughter, a wife, a secretary); she will be praised for
her endurance, her good sense, her domestic skills, her maternal
devotion, her sexual appeal, her caring sacrifice, her patriotism.
[Patriarchy, precisely because it is woven out of so many ideas and
sustained through such a plethora of intimate and formal relationships,
is stubborn, while also surprisingly flexible.]{.underline} I have the
original Hollywood poster here in my study. It was my brother, David, a
1940s movie buff, who found it. The poster announced Busby Berkeley's
1943 film The Gang's All Here. It was one of his over-the-top cinematic
extravaganzas. Its release came during a brutalizing wartime. Most
moviegoers were just clawing their way out of a deep economic
depression. But in Busby Berkeley's world it was all giant strawberries.
David had hunted down the poster because he knew that I had become
suddenly intrigued by the political roles played by the Brazilian
actress and singer Carmen Miranda. By 1943 she had left Brazil, where
she had become a radio and recording star, to dazzle audiences first on
Broadway stages and then on Hollywood's silver screen. Technicolor was
made for her. There she is in the middle of the movie poster, strutting
between phalanxes of giant strawberries. On her head is a plantation's
worth of bananas. This was the striking image splashed across the cover
of Bananas, Beaches and Bases, where I started my journey to make
feminist sense of international politics. I began doing the research
that led to Bananas, Beaches and Bases in the late 1980s, after having
already spent more than a decade investigating and teaching about racism
in militaries, the comparative politics of women, and the politics of
Southeast Asia. I wrote the manuscript specifically for the innovative
small British feminist publisher Pandora Press. A year after its British
publication (in 1989), Bananas was published in the United States, by
the University of California Press. While I consciously wrote the book
for a feminist trade press, it was after its publication in paperback by
a well-known university press that it seemed to take off. Frankly, that
took me by surprise. Looking back, I realize that it was the timing that
was propitious. In the early 1990s, more women's studies teachers were
trying to internationalize their courses. Simultaneously, more teachers
of international politics were beginning to explore the long-ignored
gendered dynamics of those relationships. Bananas. It had taken me a
surprisingly long time to think about bananas politically and
internationally, and an even longer time to ask where were the women
(and thus where were the men) in the global politics of bananas---and
why? I say "surprising" because, for years, I had been in close
proximity to other plantation crops. In Malaysia I had lived on the edge
of a rubber plantation. In the coolness of the tropical mornings, I
would watch the Malaysian Indian tappers as they emptied the
latex-filled coconut cups tacked to the slim, dappled rubber trees. Just
a few years earlier, Communist guerrillas had controlled this
plantation, but by the mid-60s the latex was once again flowing and
heading for the international market, where it would be turned by Dunlop
into tennis balls and automobile tires. Five years later I was teaching
a night-time class for a group of civil servants at Guyana's national
university. The campus was situated on the fringe of a sugar plantation.
Large beetles flew through the open windows of our classroom, attracted
by the light. This was in post-colonial Guyana. The multinational
corporation Booker still owned most of Guyana's sugar, though it was
Guyanese Indian workers who performed the hard work of planting and
harvesting the cane. Rubber and sugar. Tappers and cane workers. Dunlop
and Booker. Malaysia and Guyana. [For years, I thought about all of them
without any gender curiosity. Race, ethnicity, class,
nationality---those were the concepts that provided me with my
analytical lenses]{.underline}. Each concept was--- and has
remained---crucial for making sense of the politics of rubber and sugar.
Imagining plantation workers anywhere simply as "workers" will not yield
reliable political explanations, much less forecasts. Yet, even when
combined, these four complicating and clarifying concepts have turned
out to be inadequate to explain the full workings of power that made and
still make (and occasionally transform) the international politics of
globalized plantation crops: rubber and sugar, as well as coffee, tea,
pineapples, and palm oil. [When I returned twenty years later to
international banana politics as I was writing a revised and updated
Bananas, Beaches and Bases, some of the political players were
strikingly the same: Chiquita (formerly United Fruit), Dole and Del
Monte; the government officials of the United States, the Philippines,
the United Kingdom, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Colombia, and the Windward
Islands; housewife consumers; banana workers' unions. But I soon
discovered that there were also new actors claiming roles on bananas'
world stage: large globalized super market chains such as Carrefour,
Tesco, Walmart, and Costco; the ambitious Ecuadorian anti-union banana
magnate Álvaro Noboa and his Bonita brand; the World Trade Organization
(WTO); Brussels-based EU officials; fairtrade non-governmental
organizations (NGOs); the transnational network of women banana
workers]{.underline}. And, of course, the electronic social media: it
has connected plantation worker activists and food security activists.
The Web, however, has also reduced Carmen Miranda to merely an
inspiration for drag selfies. [Despite all these changes, I discovered
that two things have persisted. First, as in earlier decades, today's
international political economy of bananas would have come unraveled
without the labor of low-paid and unpaid women. This sophisticated
system of growing and shipping and marketing a fragile fruit has been
made to rely on imagining that women's work is unskilled and that their
wages are mere "pin money." Secondly, even with this being the reality,
and even with the recent outpourings of smart feminist-informed
scholarly studies and activist reporting, it remains all too easy for
many (most?) inter national political commentators to dismiss gender
investigations of a highly profitable globalized product as an
analytical side show]{.underline}. This is worth thinking about next
time you slice a banana on top of your morning cereal. [The workings of
globalizing patriarchy, which had been so often trivialized in the late
twentieth century, I found still remained an afterthought for many
observers, even critical observers, who claimed to make sense of the
world today. It was not just patriarchy that had proved sustainable, it
was many experts' lack of feminist curiosity that had
persisted]{.underline}. Who is making the gender analysis of the World
Trade Organization a featured case study in their university lectures?
Which teachers are encouraging their students to undertake explicitly
gendered analyses of the international politics of Tesco, Carrefour, or
Chiquita? [If anyone in a university, in an agency, or in a large NGO
answers such a question confidently with, "Oh, our gender specialist
handles those things," that is evidence of the persistent "sideshow"
phenomenon. Paying close attention to what is getting relegated to a
"sideshow"---and who exactly is doing the relegating---can shine a
bright light on what it is taking to sustain patriarchy]{.underline}. By
doing a "gender analysis" I mean, initially, charting over time the
positions of the women and of the men on all rungs on the ladder of any
organization, institution, industry, or social movement. Then, looking
at the chart, one needs to discover how the women got some places, and
the men got other places. [Next question to pose: who benefits from most
women and men being where they are?]{.underline} "Gendering," in other
words, does not happen just down on the lowest rungs---in the trenches,
on the assembly floor, amid the rubber trees, in the voting booths.
[Gendering happens up on the elite rungs as well.]{.underline} If most
of those who are involved in trade treaty bargaining (or in peace
negotiating or coup d'état plotting) are men, that decision-making is
usually riddled with the workings of manliness. [For instance, in each
process there are likely to be efforts by one of the participants, maybe
most of them, to feminize the others in order to damage their
credibility. Therefore, doing a gender analysis also requires that one
investigate (again, over time) each and every manipulation ---by any of
the actors, whether rivals or allies---of the ideas and practices of
both masculinities and femininities]{.underline}. For example, when the
male executives running the big three banana corporations introduced
washing-sheds on their plantations in the 1960s, they manipulated ideas
about femininity and what it meant to do "women's work[." They engaged
in these sorts of patriarchal manipulations so that they could justify
characterizing washing-shed work as low skilled precisely because women
were performing it. Women wash. That is what women do naturally. Thus it
is not a skill. Therefore, it does not have to be paid for as if it were
skilled work]{.underline}. [Similarly, ideas about manliness are
manipulated for organizational objectives. When the men (and
occasionally a few women) devise strategies to recruit sufficient
numbers of young men into either their statist or insurgent armed
forces, they routinely portray fighting---or at least their wielding of
weapons---as proving "real" manhood]{.underline}. If they can convince
enough young men of the authenticity of this gender credential, they
will be able, they believe, to fill their militarized ranks. [Doing
gender analysis is intellectually demanding.]{.underline} Neither casual
observations nor stereotypical assumptions are enough. I learned this
anew as I set about writing the updated Bananas, Beaches and Bases.
[Yet, when I plunged into the updating of the international politics of
military bases, of bananas, of garments, of tourism, of diplomacy, of
domestic workers, and of nationalism, I was struck again by how, amidst
all the admittedly important changes that had occurred during that last
twenty-five years, the patriarchal dynamics of international politics
had persisted. Finding these persistencies has reinforced my sense that
patriarchy is a crucial concept for making reliable sense of
international politics]{.underline}. It is not some old-fashioned
notion. Patriarchy is as up-to-date as the ripest banana and as the
deadliest military unit. [International political relationships and
tendencies are patriarchal when either of them depends, in significant
measure, on the privileging of certain sorts of masculinities in both
the distributions of power and the distributions of status and material
rewards]{.underline}. And patriarchy is at work when anything that is
deemed feminine is positioned either on a pedestal, to be admired but
not to wield authority, or on the lower rungs of the international
system's ranked order, where it can be controlled and/or exploited for
the benefit of those deemed less feminized. [At the same time, finding
these persistencies has made me newly aware of international political
patriarchy's remarkable capacities for adaptation. The only way to study
adaptability is to track the phenomenon over time. Merely to pay
attention to the present will lead one to underestimate the capacities
of any structural system, or of any cultural system, for
adaptation]{.underline}. And that will risk not only failing to press
for meaningful change, but being left in the theoretical dust. Here are
some patriarchal persistencies I uncovered while researching the new
edition of Bananas, Beaches and Bases. [The Pentagon can close its
mammoth Subic navy base in the Philippines, and dramatically expand its
bases in Guam and Italy, and open new "lily pad" bases in the United
Arab Emirates and Sub-Saharan Africa, yet the US security doctrine
continues to depend on government-to-government agreements to control
the interactions of local women with its own male military
personnel]{.underline}. Look at any government's military bases anywhere
on the globe. Each of those military bases---American, Russian, Chinese,
French, British, Saudi---depends in part on governments controlling
soldier husbands' relationships with their civilian wives, who usually
are left back at home (see Chapter Six). [Simultaneously, each of those
bases relies on cooperating with host government officials to regulate
sexual relationships between military men (and militarized contractor
men) and local or refugee girls and women in the vicinity.]{.underline}
Nationalists of assorted stripes may now be utilizing Facebook and
Twitter, yet a great many of them continue to envision an old-fashioned
"nation" made up of masculinized protectors and the feminized protected.
In that sort of nation, the protectors remain the ones popularly
presumed to have the skills required to lead peace negotiations, write
constitutions, rank state priorities, deploy security forces, and go
head-to-head with foreign rivals. [Foreign service bureaucracies of
myriad countries can open their diplomatic career tracks to more women
and even declare that diplomats' spouses need only perform social roles
as "volunteers"; nonetheless, they can continue to rely on women as
unpaid wives to grease the diplomatic gears of their trade and security
negotiations]{.underline}. (The growing numbers of diplomatic spouses
who are male do not really figure into this persistent calculation.)
Globalized apparel corporations can migrate from South Korea to China,
or to Bangladesh, Indonesia, or Cambodia, while also inserting more
intermediaries between themselves and the workers at the sewing
machines, with the goal of staving off the criticisms of new NGO
monitors; [all the while, those same corporations' executives and their
host country state elite partners persist in masculinizing their own
alliances and in feminizing clothing production as the joint sine qua
non of their respective institutional securities.]{.underline} Mango,
North Face, and Old Navy may offer hip new styles, but they are relying
on old gender formulas. Now, a warning: to uncover these continuities
does not mean that nothing in the gendered character of international
politics has changed in recent decades. [In fact, each of these
explorations has shown me how much more work---how many more exercises
of power---it takes now than it did, say, in the 1980s to sustain
international patriarchal cultures and structures.]{.underline}

[For labor market and social protection policies to fulfill their role,
they need to adapt and respond to the nature of current labor
markets.]{.underline} Economic growth does not automatically translate
into new and better jobs. Since the 1980s, austerity macroeconomic
policies have led to increasing unemployment in formal labor markets
while increasing informal employment (UN Women 2017). [While women's
labor force participation has been growing, limited decent job
opportunities constrains women's employment options in formal labor
markets.]{.underline} In Latin America, the best outcomes in terms of
formalization in the early 21st century have occurred in contexts of
accelerated economic growth and institutional interventions and
comprehensive policies, such as changes in legislation, labor
enforcement of labor regulations and employment policies
(Salazar-Xirinachs and Chacaltana 2018). Some of the formalization
strategies specifically aimed at work with considerable informality
rates. For instance, in several Latin American countries special
taxation schemes were designed for micro and small enterprises and
own-account workers and pieces of legislation were passed to regulate
minimum wage and working hours of domestic and rural workers. [However,
thus far, informality rates have not changed dramatically, suggesting
that there is a strong structural component in the regional labor market
segmentation]{.underline} (UN Women 2017).Informal work in the Global
South 203 [The debate on benefits of formalization includes the
perspective of organized women informal workers of the Global South.
Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO) argues
that the right to the city (i.e., a claim to recognize the city as a
co-created space) as well as economic rights should prevail when
discussing, for instance, street vendor's activities]{.underline}. A
legalist approach that forces them to formalize may have negative effect
on women's well-being as this may push them out of employment.
[Alternatively, there are good examples of regularization via complex
public, private and community partnership models such as in
Bhubaneshwar]{.underline}. This city is among the first ones in India to
acknowledge street vendors as an integral part of the city by
establishing aesthetically pleasing fixed kiosks in legally sanctioned
vending zones (Kumar 2012). [Some public policies tend to be gender
blind and lack awareness regarding the importance of promoting women's
autonomy and economic empowerment to move toward a more egalitarian
society. Accordingly, policy changes regarding work formalization in
Latin America do not have clear objectives regarding the gendered
constraints women face in informal employment]{.underline} (except for
those addressing domestic service work). However, in 2016--17, a growing
number of economies in the Global South have implemented employment
policies and measures based on both gender equality principles and
formalization of the informal economy. [Even when policy is
gender-blind, it can benefit women]{.underline}. Otobe (2017) describes
two such experiences: the National Human Resources and Employment Policy
for Sri Lanka and the National Employment Policy of Mozambique[. While
articulation of policy measures on formalization of informal employment
is not necessarily gender inclusive or responsive in either case, policy
measures stated under gender issues could contribute to formalization by
promoting formal employment for both women and men equally.]{.underline}
Feminist insights on the impact of informal employment Remunerated work
opportunities vary from low-waged precarious forms of informal
employment to formal jobs, which normally offer higher wages, more
stability and a certain level of social protection and security.
Informal work may lead to economic and social empowerment as it
contributes to poverty alleviation at the household level (USAID 2005)
and it may ease the "double burden" of paid and unpaid work, through
more flexible work schedules. However, freer access to informal labor
markets will not eliminate the disadvantages arising from male-biased
institutions (Meagher 2010). For example, gender pay gaps are often
wider in informal employment compared to formal employment. For
instance, in sub-Saharan Africa, the gender pay gap is 28 percent in
informal employment compared to 6 percent for formal workers. In the
informal economy, men predominate among employers and employees while
women are over-represented among the least-secure and lowest-paying
occupations (e.g., homeworkers and contributing family workers) (UN
Women 2017). [On the other hand, informal work could allow women to have
their own incomes and access to the public sphere, thus reducing their
dependence on male income-earners (Kabeer 2008, 2012).]{.underline} In
their study of the Ecuador, Vega et al. (2016) conclude that the
economic livelihood strategies are not necessarily translated into
empowerment processes. [Nevertheless, they argue that particularly young
women see informal activities as temporary, in which case these
strategies may be a means to enhance social mobility and to improve
their prospects]{.underline}. Moreover, there are examples of informal,
poor women workers organizing and being empowered, such as through SEWA
(Self Employed Women's Association) and WIEGO. Agenda for decent work
Most studies of informal employment have not incorporated a critical
perspective that examines gendered power relations (Chant and Pedwell
2008). They also lack an intersectional approach that takes into account
the differences and relations among women. An in-depth study of these
aspects requires quantitative and qualitative research, which will shed
light on the processes and subjective elements and their impact on
women's autonomy and economic empowerment. Gender-blind analyses of the
mechanisms and features of informality in labor markets lead to partial
explanations and therefore partial solutions to informality. Thus,
addressing economic and social causes of informal employment is as
important as identifying and examining the implications of gender
discrimination and employment segregation and the gender division of
paid and unpaid work that contribute to informality. Moreover, it is
necessary to incorporate an intersectional perspective, which addresses
not only gender but a range of axes of social differentiation such as
class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, age, nation, religion and ability
(Chant and Pedwell 2008). [Considering that informal employment is
principally a problem of weak labor demand, macroeconomic policies
should target increasing labor demand. Particularly, to tackle gender
inequality in the labor market, there is a need to invest in public care
services and create decent job opportunities in the areas of health,
education, child and elderly care services (ILO 2018d).]{.underline} The
redistribution of unpaid household work and care work not only within
households (between women and men) but also among public and private
sector actors should be included as part of public policies based on
principles of equity and social co-responsibility. [Public policies that
facilitate equitable sharing of care work allow women to enter the labor
force and to avoid precarious forms of work]{.underline}. These policies
include parental leave policies and public provision of child and
elderly care services. [To combat occupational segregation, public
interventions are important to address its root causes, including
differences in educational attainment, training and experience as well
as stereotypes about the roles of women and men in society.]{.underline}
To provide women with income opportunities beyond informal employment it
is also necessary to strengthen women's income security, for example, by
providing access to unemployment protection and public work programs (UN
Women 2017). [Addressing informality and decent work deficits require
changes in the design and application of social protection
programs]{.underline}. As the 101st Session of the International Labor
Conference made clear in Recommendation No. 202, the social protection
floor is a means of extending social security coverage where the
contributory and noncontributory benefits operate in conjunction (ILO
2012). This combination may have positive impacts on job quality and may
promote formalization. Given higher levels of participation of women in
informal, precarious forms of work and the interruption of their work
career because of their reproductive role and disproportionate care work
burden, a strong non-contributory pillar of social protection scheme
could be the key to promoting gender equality in social protection.

### Liberalism Good

#### Liberalism is key to checking oppression---policy reforms key to maintaining the liberal world order

**Traub 22**

James, nonresident fellow at New York University's Center on
International Cooperation. \"Liberalism Isn't Dead---but It's Very
Sick\", Foreign Policy, 5/10/2022,

LJS

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has played out like a terribly grim, but
so far at least, profoundly ennobling laboratory experiment in the
relative virtues of autocracy and liberal democracy.]{.underline} Yet
evidence that a (more or less) liberal democracy can defeat or withstand
an autocracy even in war---the one sphere that so obviously favors the
latter---hasn't, and probably won't, meaningfully diminish the forces
that have undermined liberalism in the West and around the world.
Indeed, the sharp division between Western democracies that regard the
invasion as an intolerable violation of moral principle and non-Western
and barely liberal ones like India and South Africa that have treated it
as geopolitics as usual only reinforces the idea that liberal democracy
occupies a diminishing space in the world. It is possible that liberal
democracy was a historically contingent experiment that depended on
underlying conditions that no longer obtain. In his 2018 book, The
People vs. Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger and How to Save It,
Harvard scholar Yascha Mounk described those limiting conditions as
broadly shared prosperity, relative demographic homogeneity, and sources
of information that encompass the whole population. That was the last
century, not this one. [Yet if you believe that all alternatives to
liberal democracy are much worse---indeed, unbearable---then you must
proceed as if the illness it suffers from is curable.]{.underline} That
is the premise of Mounk's new work, the more optimistically titled The
Great Experiment: Why Diverse Democracies Fall Apart and How They Can
Endure, as well as Liberalism and Its Discontents by Francis Fukuyama,
also a long-standing combatant in the liberalism wars. [Liberalism, as
Fukuyama describes it, functions as a political technology for the
management of otherwise irreconcilable differences]{.underline}.
Liberals from the time of Thomas Hobbes in the 17th century have erected
a series of procedural rules and normative principles---above all, the
rule of law and the rights of individuals to pursue their own
preferences---to limit the reach of absolutist doctrines. Liberal rules
and norms allow people of different views not only to get along but to
subscribe to the implicit "contract" on which democratic government
rests. Liberalism is endangered when the "factions," to use James
Madison's term, that arise naturally in society cease to respect the
rules and norms. But liberalism has a problem when those factions
consist not of like-minded individuals but of tribes: ethnic or
religious groups bound together less by changeable beliefs than by
immutable characteristics. A "diverse democracy," in Mounk's sense, is a
heterogeneous one. In such states, "where virtually everyone votes along
religious or ethnic lines," Mounk observes, "a large portion of the
population forms a permanent minority," locked out of power, while
majorities use their power to dominate or marginalize minorities, as
white people did to Black people in the American antebellum and Jim Crow
South and as Hindus now do to Muslims in India. Liberalism addresses
people as equal, free-standing citizens; but Mounk has concluded that
the wish to stand apart from kin, culture, and state is less primordial
than we think[. Both experience and social science research show us that
people are by nature "groupish." The chief threat to liberalism over the
last decade has been majoritarian nationalism provoked by real or
alleged threats to collective identity]{.underline}---whiteness in the
United States and Europe, Hinduism in India, Judaism in Israel, and
Islam in Turkey. Against this rage, liberal universalism, the idea that
we all have equal rights based in our common humanity, has steadily
retreated. No one has developed an entirely convincing answer to the
problem of diverse democracy. The "consociational" model, where power is
allocated among groups that enjoy formal status, has worked out well in
the Netherlands, divided between Catholics and Protestants, but very
badly in Lebanon, where power-sharing among different religious factions
has currently produced a vacuum of governance very close to anarchy.
Slightly over 40 percent of the French public just voted for a
presidential candidate who promised to restore the primacy of natives
over newcomers and, not coincidentally, white people over people of
color. The first wave of rise-of-illiberalism books---including Mounk's
and Fukuyama's earlier books as well as Steven Levitsky and Daniel
Ziblatt's How Democracies Die and my own What Was Liberalism?: The Past,
Present, and Promise of a Noble Idea---focused almost entirely on the
right-wing nationalism of former U.S. President Donald Trump, French
politician Marine Le Pen, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and
others. That's old news by now. One of the features of the new
generation of liberalism-in-peril books is worry over the rise of an
identitarian left that is equally contemptuous of liberal restraints.
Fukuyama writes of a species of identity politics that "sees the lived
experiences of different groups as fundamentally incommensurate." White
people cannot understand what it means to be Black; racism is not an
individual attitude but is rather imprinted in the structures of power,
and thus in collective consciousness. Mounk describes the "strategic
essentialism" of those who insist that we treat race or gender as
ineradicable essences. This is the new groupishness of the left. Anyone
who has spent time in the advanced institutions of American
culture---universities, art museums, foundations, newspapers---will
recognize this mentality. It is, however, striking that while right-wing
nationalism has circled the globe, the so-called woke left is an almost
entirely U.S. phenomenon. It explains nothing about illiberalism in
India or Poland and very little about France or Germany. Why is it that
the most advanced progressive thinking in the United States, but not
elsewhere, is obsessed with the policing of group boundaries and the
honoring of group rights? Perhaps because of the unique role that racial
anger and racial shame play in the United States. The effect, in any
case, is to set up a kind of reciprocal tribalism, where the left and
right goad each other to greater extremes. Both agree on the need to
weed out evil books from libraries but disagree violently over the books
in question; meanwhile, what historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called the
"vital center" recedes to an ever more distant horizon. [What is to be
done? Fukuyama's answer is to defend the citadel]{.underline}. In this
slim volume (a euphemism for a long magazine article by a famous author
that publishers are eager to issue in book form), Fukuyama, in the
manner of philosopher Isaiah Berlin, traces the evolutionary path of the
new illiberal ideologies, locating their origin in the postmodern
critique of rationality of philosophers Jacques Derrida and Michel
Foucault, a doctrine of the radical left later picked up by the right.
And then, like a stout crusader of liberalism, he smites them one and
all. [Fukuyama first refutes what might be called the neoliberal or free
market heresy of liberalism, noting that while humans are indeed
self-seeking, "they are also intensely social creatures who cannot be
individually happy without the support and recognition provided by their
peers." But neoliberalism is a heresy, or a perversion, for liberal
societies created the redistributionist state that promoted equality in
the 20th century. Fukuyama goes on to note that liberalism is not so
obsessed with the individual as to inevitably atomize society, as many
Catholic conservatives claim:]{.underline} "Private associational life
has grown enormously" in the liberal societies of the West. Nor must
liberal states plead guilty to colonialism. How, after all, should we
explain the rise of liberal East Asian states innocent of that charge?
Fukuyama reminds liberals of what they stand for and why they are right
to stand for it. Of course, that's not a solution. Mounk writes that big
books about ideas tend to be far better at explaining the problem than
at offering solutions. Another way of putting it, though, is that
illiberalism is the kind of problem to which solutions inevitably feel
inadequate because the problem is not a failure of policy but of
collective belief. [How do you create conditions that will favor a
restoration of a vanished consensus? For Mounk, that comes down to the
question of mechanisms to contain and channel the tribalism that one
cannot wish away]{.underline}. Ranked choice voting, for example, will
help gain representation for minorities, he argues. [Much of Mounk's
agenda resembles the current Democratic Party platform: broad-based
economic growth, progressive taxation, and opportunities for social
mobility---all designed to create a sense of collective rather than
tribal good]{.underline}. In that vein, he argues---against the
progressive left---for universal rather than race-conscious policies and
for limits on immigration, a flash point for the nativist right. These
are good solutions, but I do not see how they will cure the patient.
(For the record, I was not entirely convinced by the solutions I offered
in What Was Liberalism?) Mounk doesn't entirely disagree: [He writes
that liberalism ultimately must be defended at the level of private and
social behavior]{.underline}. He advises all of us to think for
ourselves and be prepared to criticize our own side and restrain the
impulse to vilify the other. I am guessing that most readers of his book
will not need that advice, whereas the tribalists of left and right
would sneer at it. I read The Great Experiment while thinking about
India, the biggest and most diverse of the world's democracies. India is
also among the sickest patients in the liberal democracy ward. Born
under the star of secularism and tolerance, India under Modi has
increasingly become a theistic and intolerant society that advances the
cause of Hinduism at the expense of its more than 200 million Muslims. I
asked myself whether Mounk had anything to offer the many Indians who
believe in the nation's secular values and deeply fear their demise. The
answer is: not much. Some diseases prove fatal; others can only be cured
very slowly, as the patient's own defenses finally rally. I am in favor
of everything Mounk suggests; I am even more in favor of Fukuyama's
rousing call to truth. [Only liberalism, as both authors argue, can
allow us to live safely and prosperously in a diverse world. But I
recognize that the restraints imposed by liberal rules and norms ask a
great deal of citizens, far more than nativism, nationalism, or
majoritarian tyranny do. We need to keep fighting for what is right even
as we recognize that the road will be long.]{.underline}

#### Modern liberalism good---defensive liberalism is the most effective tool for emancipation in modernity and reforms solve its flaws

Democracy: Liberal Internationalism and the Crises of Global Order. Pp

[On what grounds can we defend liberal internationalism?]{.underline}
This question can be answered by looking at six major debates that
liberal internationalists have had among themselves over their project's
scope and character. In these debates, they have grappled with the
trade-offs between efficiency and social stability, sovereignty and
interventionism, and global openness and political community. They have
debated the nature of "the global"---the forces and logic shaping the
modern world and their implications for the security and well-being of
liberal democracy. As they did in past crises, liberal internationalists
must again debate the character, limits, and possibilities of their
project. Efficiency versus Social Stability A core strand of liberal
internationalism has been a commitment to open trade. Countries linked
by trade and open markets gain both economically and politically.
[Ideally, trade generates efficiency and welfare gains for countries
that participate, thus facilitating their growth and advancement. These
mutual gains and interdependence have political effects, including
heightened incentives to settle disputes peacefully.]{.underline} From
the British repeal of the Corn Laws to the post-1945 building of a
multilateral trading system, liberal democracies have consistently
looked for ways to realize the gains of trade. [Winners win more than
losers lose, so if the winnings are distributed in ways that compensate
the losers, everyone comes out ahead]{.underline}. But open trade is a
disruptive threat to workers and communities, and the social bargains
that soften the impact of economic dislocation are imperfect. In giving
national governments space and policy tools to pursue economic
stabilization and development, the "embedded liberalism" behind the
reconstruction of the postwar Western world tried to reconcile open
trade and free-market capitalism with social protections and economic
security. [As we saw in chapter 8, this compromise has broken down. The
embrace of neoliberal policies and the deregulation and global
integration of capital markets that accompanied the post--Cold War
spread of economic and political liberalism have been driving
forces.]{.underline} The Western governments' capacity and willingness
to maintain their social democratic commitments has waned. Even under
the best of conditions, the model of international trade at the heart of
economic liberalism oversimplifies reality. "It neglects all the
noneconomic considerations that so often turn governments away from its
prescriptions, such as the social and cultural side-effects of trade, or
the frequent neglect of public goods, collective equipments, and
education," writes Stanley Hoffmann. "Above all, it ignores factors of
inequality: the benefits from free trade spread slowly, if at all, and
unevenly through the formidable barriers of privilege, class, and status
within societies (in which small groups often monopolize the rewards)
and the obstacles of unequal endowments and levels of development in the
world."1 Not all the rise in inequality or the breakdown in economic and
social protections is traceable to the liberalization of trade and
capital flows. Technological changes in the workplace and shifts from
manufacturing to services also play a role.2 But efficiency gains from
deeper economic integration seem to be slowing relative to the rise of
economic insecurity and inequality. Dani Rodrik argues that the advanced
industrial countries have already passed the point beyond which expanded
trade does more to redistribute wealth within their societies than to
increase efficiency and growth. Although economic globalization is
intensifying the gaps between the winners and losers, it is not
generating sufficient economic gains to compensate the losers.3 In
making the case for economic openness, liberal internationalists will
need to reestablish the foundations of embedded liberalism---that is,
managed openness that reconnects trade and markets with social security
and shared gains. The industrial world cannot return to the early
decades of the Bretton Woods system, but it can look for new ways to
balance openness and social protections. [The aim of reforming
international rules and institutions should be to enable national
governments to make good on their social democratic
commitments]{.underline}. "Democracies have a right to protect their
social arrangements," Rodrik argues, "and when this right clashes with
the requirements of the global economy, it is the latter that should
give way."4 [Economic openness can last in liberal democracies only if
it is tied to a social ethic of fairness and shared benefits. Without
inaugurating a new era of protectionism, liberal democracies have to
reestablish the multilateral system of rules and institutions that
allows states to manage openness, guided by the liberal norms of
multilateralism, reciprocity, and nondiscrimination]{.underline}. They
need to rebuild the social contract at home and renew the international
rules and norms that balance openness with social stability. Sovereignty
versus Interventionism [The norms of sovereign equality and national
self-determination are integral to the modern liberal international
vision]{.underline}. As we have seen, by the second half of the
twentieth century, the liberal international project was firmly built on
a Westphalian foundation. [To be sure, the United States and other
liberal states have repeatedly practiced all the dark arts of power
politics.]{.underline} Throughout the Cold War and post--Cold War
decades, they have transgressed sovereignty norms through military
intervention, covert action, and coercive regime change. [But the norms
and principles of state sovereignty remain firmly embedded in the
institutions and legitimating rationale of the post--World War II
liberal international order.]{.underline} American military
interventionism during the Cold War played out as part of the
geopolitical and ideological struggle with the Soviet Union. The Korean
and Vietnam Wars were the most tragic and costly of the dozens of armed
interventions carried out by the United States across the Cold War
periphery. [Since the Soviet Union fell, the reasons for interventions
have expanded to include humanitarian disasters, human rights
violations, and nonstate terrorist threats]{.underline}. In areas of
humanitarianism, economic policy, and democracy promotion, the Western
liberal states look increasingly as if they are trying to impose their
own values and interests on weaker states.5 [In this regard, it is
useful to distinguish between two versions of liberal internationalism:
defensive and offensive.6]{.underline} Defensive liberalism is the older
liberal orientation anchored in the norms of self-determination and the
right of countries to maintain their own institutions and doctrines.
[Offensive liberalism is the more recent universalizing agenda that
involves the reordering of other societies.7 Rising states such as
China, India, and Brazil tend to embrace defensive liberalism and resist
the intrusiveness of the newer liberalism.]{.underline} In accommodating
these rising powers, liberal internationalism will need to rethink their
offensive liberal impulses[. Gaining agreement on the broader principles
of order---sovereignty and multilateral rules and institutions that
allow states to manage their interdependence---should take precedence
over efforts to force convergence on the details of development or
governance]{.underline}. [In the areas of human rights and transnational
terrorism, the dilemmas are less about the imposition of liberal values
on unwilling states than about the circumstances under which the
international community needs to act.8]{.underline} When a state commits
mass domestic violence such as genocide or ethnic cleansing, the outside
world cannot simply look away. If a state is collapsed or unable to
prevent transnational terrorist groups from operating on its territory,
these circumstances might also require the international community's
intervention[. The response proposed for these occasions is the evolving
norm of "responsibility to protect" (R2P), which was adopted by the
United Nations in 2005 and remains controversial.9 R2P is not a license
for great powers to unilaterally intervene in weaker
states]{.underline}. It is meant to stimulate international agreement on
the circumstances under which agents of the international
community---authorized by the United Nations---are morally obliged to
prevent or stop atrocities. The burden of the norm is actually
Westphalian in implication. Its goal is to strengthen the presumption
that national governments must make good on their obligations as
sovereign states and that the international order should help them do
so. [Only in the absence of this Westphalian state capacity---and under
extreme conditions defined by the international community---do outside
powers intervene]{.underline}. The goal for liberal internationalists
should be to seek as wide an agreement as possible on the legal bases
for intervention.10 Clubs and Open Systems The postwar liberal
international order was built around exclusive groupings of states, such
as NATO and the European Union, as well as wider multilateral
organizations with more open membership, such as the United Nations.
When the Cold War broke the world into bipolar blocs, the United States
and its partners put their efforts into building the Western economic
and security order. This Western political grouping resembled a club. It
was a clearly defined, exclusive group of like-minded states with a
shared identity based on their regime characteristics, geography, and
historical experience. There was little doubt about who was inside and
who was outside the order.11 As I argued in chapter 6, the club
character of the postwar liberal order was important for its
functioning. To be inside was to have rights and responsibilities. The
club offered protection and provided governments with institutions and
capacities to facilitate cooperation and problem solving. The
compromises of embedded liberalism were organized within its confines.
That there were barriers to entry only reinforced commitment and
cooperation. In chapter 8, I argued that the erosion of this club-like
nature is a defining feature of the current crisis. [Open systems of
multilateral cooperation, which reflect the Westphalian norms of
sovereign equality and nondiscrimination that are embedded in the wider
global order, are also integral to the liberal international
vision]{.underline}. Membership in these organizations is predicated not
on regime character, but only on recognition of a state's sovereign
status and its commitment and ability to carry out the responsibilities
of membership. [If the legitimacy of the club of liberal democracies
lies in their shared social purposes, the legitimacy of open systems of
order derives from the universalism inherent in Westphalian principles
of sovereignty]{.underline}. An open system's strength is its
inclusiveness. [For many realms of international relations---including
arms control, pandemic disease prevention, environmental regulation, and
management of the global commons---regime type is not relevant to
cooperation]{.underline}. Addressing these problems requires as wide a
participation of states as possible. The weakness of open systems is in
enforcement. If the rules say that any state can be in or out as it
chooses, the benefits of membership cannot be predicated on embracing a
suite of values and responsibilities. Liberal internationalists,
including Woodrow Wilson, have spoken up for both types of order.
Initially, in offering American support for a postwar organization,
Wilson argued in favor of open and universal membership. In his speech
to the League to Enforce the Peace in May 1916, Wilson said the United
States "shall be as much concerned as the nations at war to see peace
assume an aspect of permanence." This was why it would be in the
nation's interest to participate in a "universal association of the
nations . . . to prevent any war begun either contrary to treaty
covenants or without warning and full submission of the causes to the
opinion of the world---a virtual guarantee of territorial integrity and
political independence." Eager not to be seen as committing the United
States to upholding an unjust status quo, Wilson advanced general
principles that would guide the settlement, including famously asserting
that "every people" had "a right to choose the sovereignty under which
they shall live," and small states were entitled to "the same respect
for their sovereignty and for their integrity that great and powerful
nations expect and insist upon."12 During the years of American
neutrality, Wilson did not once mention that the peace settlement would
be linked to the way states were internally governed or the character of
their regimes.13 In January 1917, Wilson's "peace without victory"
speech explicitly called for a settlement between existing states and
regimes. It was only after Wilson brought the United States into the war
that he shifted the focus to freedom and democracy as prerequisites for
peace. In his War Address in April 1917, Wilson now asserted that "a
steadfast concert of peace can never be maintained except by a
partnership of democratic governments. No autocratic state government
could be trusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants."14
Wilson was now envisaging a more exclusive grouping of democracies that
would be bound together ideologically and oriented toward building a
democratic peace. After the war was over, Wilson essentially reverted
back to the open and universal version of his program. For Wilson, in
the end, the establishment of a League of Nations was more important
than the specific logic of its membership. The question today for
liberal internationalism is: How much of the clublike character of
liberal order should and can be rebuilt? The goal is not to undermine or
ignore the Westphalian principles that set the terms of wider global
cooperation. [But what is the future of the deeper, more exclusive
cooperation among liberal democracies? In security relations, human
rights, and the political economy of industrial society, liberal
democracies have specific interests and values that illiberal states do
not. Exclusive groupings within the wider international order are still
an important means for advancing these values]{.underline}. So too is it
important to strengthen the mechanisms of conditionality and the
enforcement of norms and principles within the club. The European Union
is struggling to respond to member states that transgress its common
standards. NATO has also found itself struggling to deal with alliance
members that lose their democratic character.15 The irony of the rise of
China and Russia as overt challengers to Western liberal democracy is
that it may strengthen the identity and functioning of the liberal
democratic world as a political grouping, even as it gives illiberal
states an alternative club to join. Relations with the Illiberal World
Dealing with illiberal great powers is one of the oldest problems facing
the liberal international order. Do you invite them in, anticipating
that they will become socialized and move toward liberal democracy? Do
you exclude them? Do you actively seek to confront their revisionist
agendas, or seek peaceful coexistence? At different times over the past
two centuries, liberal states have pursued all these strategies. [The
underlying reality is that the liberal international order---open,
rules-based, and organized around a core of liberal democracies---is a
threat to illiberal states]{.underline}. From their perspective, the
United States and the liberal capitalist order are revisionist. The
American grand strategy at the end of the Cold War was to invite the
illiberal states into the liberal order. [Once China and Russia gained
the benefits of trade and exchange, went the reasoning, they would
understand that it was in their interest to become "responsible
stakeholders."]{.underline} Implicit in this logic was the expectation
that these states would engage in self-initiated regime change. They
would slowly shed their autocratic and authoritarian institutions and
move closer to the Western liberal democratic model. [This has not
happened, and liberal internationalists must now reassess their
assumptions and consider new approaches. One option is to seek
accommodation with these illiberal states by making the liberal
international order less revisionist. This might mean curtailing efforts
to promote "offensive" liberalism"---that is, efforts to push and pull
these states toward the liberal democratic model]{.underline}. In
effect, this strategy calls for making the liberal international order
friendly to China and Russia by stepping back from the vision of a
one-world liberal order. [The emphasis instead would be on coexistence,
building on the "defensive" liberal principles of self-determination,
tolerance, and ideological pluralism]{.underline}. Liberal
internationalism would be made more conservative.16 Another option is to
confront illiberal states more aggressively. The assumption here is that
China and Russia are the vanguard of a broader longterm challenge to the
liberal international order. If it cannot contain the ambitions of these
countries, the liberal order itself is threatened. This view hinges on a
key claim about China: that it hopes to perfect an authoritarian model
of industrial society that can compete with---and even surpass---the
long-term growth capacity of liberal democracy. The jury is still out.17
But if China does succeed in offering the world an illiberal pathway to
modernity, the stakes for the liberal democratic world rise and the
rivalry can easily become a Cold War--style struggle between deeply
antagonistic ideological and political projects. [Finally, liberal
internationalists might pursue a mixed strategy of looking for
opportunities to cooperate with China and Russia on the playing field of
Westphalian internationalism, focusing on shared functional problems
such as arms control, environment, and the global commons, while
actively seeking to consolidate and strengthen cooperation across the
liberal democratic world. Here the assumption is that the liberal
democracies---particularly if they are organized worldwide---have
long-term advantages that will bend the grand struggle in their
favor]{.underline}. The key is to renew and defend liberal democracy
within like-minded states and to strengthen the institutions,
functionality, and legitimacy of the liberal international order.18
Hegemony and Restraint on Power [Over the past century, the liberal
international project has become deeply entangled with the exercise of
American power]{.underline}. Woodrow Wilson carried liberal
internationalist ideas to the Paris Peace Conference. After World War
II, the United States built a liberal hegemonic order organized around
open, rules-based relations and a core of Western liberal democracies.
As I argued in chapter 6, this liberal hegemonic order both amplified
and legitimated American power as well as shaped and restrained it. The
United States tied itself to the other leading liberal states and
exercised power through an array of economic, political, and security
institutions. How restrained it was during the postwar era is a subject
of much debate. Institutional restraints were certainly not an iron
cage, and the United States reserved the right to act unilaterally when
it chose. Power politics was hardly eliminated from the democratic
world. [Nonetheless, this liberal hegemonic order did manifest important
features of consent. The United States and the other Western liberal
democracies used institutions to establish restraint and commitment, and
in doing so, they created an order that was somewhat independent of
balance-of-power and imperial logics. The presence of liberal
institutions allowed these states to dampen the two forces that
typically shape international order---anarchy and empire. These forces
never totally disappeared, of course, but they retreated enough to
define the Western order as a hierarchical order with liberal
characteristics.19]{.underline} Liberal internationalism has both
benefited and suffered under American hegemony. Like Great Britain in
the nineteenth century, the United States in the twentieth century
incorporated liberal internationalist ideas and projects into its
hegemonic order building while pursuing other great-power strategies.
Great Britain held on to its empire, and the United States engaged in
crude imperial ventures and cultivated close relations with illiberal
states. [But particularly after 1945, it is difficult to see how liberal
internationalism--- defined as open and rules-based order with
progressive social purposes--- would have fared any better if it were
not closely tied to America's efforts to organize and dominate the
postwar international order]{.underline}. As I argued in chapter 6,
American postwar leaders recognized the value of binding the nation to
other liberal democracies and operating within the postwar system of
multilateral institutions. This strategy made American power more
legitimate and enduring. The liberal great power's pursuit of
enlightened self-interest was integral to the rise and spread of liberal
ideas and projects. Yet the United States also demonstrated, repeatedly,
that it can be an unfaithful steward of liberal internationalism. Under
the Trump administration, it is actively seeking to undermine the
liberal features of the existing global order. The challenge for liberal
internationalists is to try to recover the connections between hegemony
and liberal order. The reasons powerful liberal states might want to
build and operate within a system of open, rules-based relations are
clear enough. As I argued in chapter 8, the hollowing out of the
security-community character of the existing liberal order is one reason
it is now in crisis: today it is easier for leaders to offer alternative
narratives of the American national interest. The Trump administration's
claims that the liberal order generates more costs than benefits for the
United States also register with some voters. [Yet the costs that the
United States incurs from seeking to operate outside the rules and norms
of liberal international order are also real---and over the long term,
they are much greater. They include the loss of influence, credibility,
and the cooperation of friends and allies.]{.underline} America's
democratic allies clearly want the United States to remain within this
order. During the high tide of American unipolarity, it was possible for
US officials to see less value in liberal rules and institutions. [But
in an era of declining American power, the value of cooperation with
other liberal democracies should grow]{.underline}. Roles,
responsibilities, expectations, bargains---these aspects of the postwar
liberal order draw our attention precisely because the Trump
administration ignores and undermines them. [Yet lurking in this new
danger is an opportunity to renegotiate the hegemonic character of
liberal internationalism or, short of this, build a post-hegemonic
consortium of like-minded states that could collectively underwrite a
reformed liberal order.]{.underline}

### A2 Liberalism = Imperialism

#### Liberalism is key to checking imperialism---liberal ideology elevates universal rights

[If liberal internationalism had an urge for empire, it also had an urge
to oppose it. In the late nineteenth century, liberal thinkers in the
United States and Europe added their voices to movements against empire
and colonialism]{.underline}. After the world wars, many liberal
internationalists, particularly in the United States, championed the
League of Nations and the United Nations as institutions that enshrined
principles of self-determination and sovereign equality---and thus
offered a path away from empire. As the twentieth century unfolded,
liberal internationalists grew increasingly committed to postimperial
forms of order. These changes in orientation played out in the struggles
between the United States and Britain during and after World War II over
imperial preferences and global spheres of influence. The shift away
from empire emerged as part of the general reimagining of liberal
internationalism in the 1940s and during the Cold War, when the United
States put its weight behind a world organized around sovereign states
as it pursued its expanding geopolitical interests and built postwar
order. [In important respects, however, it was not the West that turned
liberal internationalism against empire and imperialism but the
non-West, which seized upon ideas and principles---universal in
character but often instrumental in origin and purpose---and applied
them to struggles over sovereignty, rights, and rules.]{.underline}
Wilson-era liberal internationalism had offered global ideas, but it
retained an old-style Western parochialism. The vision of liberal order
put forward by Wilson and his peers was more "civilizational" than
"universal." The League of Nations would be open to the wider world, but
it was organized around the Western liberal democracies. States that
were considered insufficiently mature to join the community of sovereign
states would have to wait until they were ready. As Edward Keene argues,
the League of Nations entailed the "internationalization" of
civilization---so there were limits on the universal or global scope of
membership and standing. "Although ideological concerns were beginning
to become more important in defining the boundaries of the civilized
world, racial discrimination was still a major element in deciding which
peoples were entitled to membership in the new organization and thus to
have their sovereign status recognized."62 [With the rebuilding of order
after World War II and the establishment of the United Nations, this
civilizational view---the distinction between the "family of civilized
nations" and the rest of the world---gave way to a more universalistic
and inclusive conception]{.underline}. Keene argues, "Simply put: the
United Nations was envisioned as, or quite rapidly became, an
organization of all the world's peoples, with universal participation in
the projects of preserving peace and developing global civilization,
whereas the League had, above all, been an organization of civilized
nations, working collectively for all the world's peoples." Postwar
notions of states, peoples, sovereignty, and civilization were becoming
less based on nineteenth-century notions of the social hierarchies of
peoples. As Keene notes, "the development of the UN system reflected a
much more inclusive attitude toward non-European peoples, in keeping
with the recognition that they were no less civilized than their
European counterparts."63 [What changed between 1919 and 1945 was the
conception of how peoples and societies from different regions and
civilizations related to each other as moral and legal entities, a move
driven in part by a fuller acknowledgment of the universal reach of the
notion of sovereign equality.64 But it was also driven by the growing
salience of the "rights of peoples"---the spread of the claim that all
human beings, by virtue of being human, have fundamental and inalienable
rights.]{.underline} Behind this shift were changing views of modernity
and civilization. Civilization itself was weakening as an intellectual
construct, and modernity was not seen simply as something spreading
outward from its Western center. [The new divide was not the West versus
the non-West---which had become untenable---but the liberal democratic
world versus the illiberal world]{.underline}. Modernity empowered both
sides of this political universe. In World War II, the great struggle on
behalf of civilization had been against Nazi Germany, a European power
that was itself employing scientific theories of race to legitimate its
violence and aggression---ideas that had been used in the nineteenth
century to defend European imperial domination over "backward"
non-European peoples.65 In this sense, the old civilizational
justification for two world orders---a Western system of civilized
states and a backward and uncivilized world beyond---did not fail
because non-European peoples gradually joined the "family of civilized
nations." It collapsed when civilized states---Germany, Japan, and
Russia---joined the noncivilized world.66 As I noted in chapter 5, this
shift in thinking occurred in the United States during the war years and
continued during the Cold War. [The rise of fascism and totalitarianism
led Roosevelt and his contemporaries to let go of their notions of
civilization, race, and nation and rethink the nature of liberalism and
modernity. With threats to the liberal capitalist order now coming from
inside the West, what it meant to be civilized could no longer be
defined by race or culture or geography]{.underline}. This sentiment was
captured by Leonard Woolf in a short book published in 1939, Barbarians
at the Gate, in which he argued that civilization was not a geographical
or even a cultural construction but a way of regulating individual
behavior within human communities. Europe might have found a distinctive
approach to restraining violence, tyranny, and predation, but
civilization was distributed more widely around the world---and so too
was the antithesis of civilization, or what Woolf called barbarism.
Writing on the eve of World War II, Woolf argued that "the barbarian is,
therefore, not only at the gates; he is always within the walls of our
civilization, inside our minds and our hearts."67 This new sense that
the dangers to the liberal democratic world came from inside that world
forced American and European internationalists to rethink their
principles and projects. [American liberal internationalists began to
make more serious efforts to separate their project from the legacies of
European imperialism. This separation was driven by evolving ideas about
sovereignty and self-determination, grand shifts in geopolitical
interests, depression, and wartime politics within Western liberal
democracies, as well as by more immediate struggles brought on by the
war and the way it changed the Anglo-American relationship]{.underline}.
The United States did not have the same attachments to empire as the
British, and cracks opened up within the West on whether and how the
world would transition away from empire.68 This was seen most clearly at
the Atlantic Charter meeting in 1941, where Roosevelt and Churchill
disagreed over the future of the British imperial preference system and
the principles of sovereign rights and self-determination.69

#### Liberalism is ideologically opposed to imperialism---the right to self-determination created an anti-colonial feedback loop between liberal democracies, former colonies, and oppressed groups within great powers

[A second force separating liberal internationalism and empire was the
ideas themselves, filtered through political movements both in the
liberal democracies and outside the Western world]{.underline}.
Roosevelt's Four Freedoms and the Atlantic Charter, the most sweeping of
these ideas, can be seen as efforts by wartime democratic leaders to
mobilize their people for war. In this sense, they served an
instrumental purpose. For Roosevelt, the Atlantic Charter was a way to
legitimize for the American people their imminent entrance into the war.
It was an effort to counter Nazi propaganda by offering subjugated
nations and neutrals in Europe a sweeping liberal democratic vision of a
better world to come. [But even if universalist principles are uttered
for instrumental reasons, once they enter into the discourse they become
part of the contested ideological landscape upon which political
struggles are waged.76 To be sure, some liberal internationalists were
deeply committed to presiding over liberalism's separation from
empire]{.underline}. Roosevelt's closest adviser on postwar planning,
Sumner Welles---the driving force behind the Atlantic Charter and later
the United Nations---earnestly sought to use wartime negotiations with
the British to escort Britain's empire offstage. He and other Wilsonians
had spent the 1930s reflecting on the failures of 1919, looking for new
ways to build a cooperative global order that, as Welles put it,
"implies the juridic equality of every nation and the acceptance of a
moral order and of effective international law."77 Welles sought to lay
down principles that would weaken the political standing of empire in
the postwar world.78 [But it was the wider use of self-determination and
sovereign equality that gave these principles impact]{.underline}. This
struggle was waged on many fronts, driven by geopolitical and
ideological clashes and movements within the West and between it and the
non-West. [It is not simply---or primarily---a story of the West
"externalizing" its ideas and institutions to the rest of the world.
NonWestern peoples and societies seized on the principles and
institutions that the West had developed for itself and adapted them for
their own purposes in their struggles for independence]{.underline}.
Witnessing the decolonization movements in 1964, Rupert Emerson observed
that when non-Western people "press for equality, democracy, and the
right of self-determination, they are asking their present and erstwhile
rulers to live up to the ideals which these same rulers have transmitted
to them and proclaimed as their own. . . . [The nationalism which
developed in the imperial West in the nineteenth century, with its
implied right of self-determination, can in this sense be seen as one of
the key sources of anti-colonialism]{.underline}."79 Westphalian and
liberal internationalist ideas were both pushed and pulled into the rest
of the world. The "reception and remolding of Western ideas" by peoples
and societies in the non-West, C. A. Bayly argues, "set limits on the
nature and extent of their domination by European power-holders."80 The
formal and informal unraveling of empire and colonialism is one of the
great dramas of the post-1945 era. [From the 1950s to the early 1960s,
the previous century's era of imperial expansion underwent a radical
reversal]{.underline}. Robin Winks notes, "One after another, the
colonized territories tried to establish their independence from
European control. From Guinea to Somalia, from Morocco to India, the
flags of France, Britain, Italy, Holland, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal
came down. In their place were hoisted newly designed flags of the newly
sovereign states. By the mid-1980s, no substantial area was under
colonial rule, although the radically discriminatory regime prevailed in
the Republic of Africa."81 The predominant view in Europe at the end of
the nineteenth century was that the imperial system would remain the
core organizing logic of world order. Yet, in less than a hundred years,
these empires---along with the Soviet Union---had disappeared.82
[Political movements in the United States and the other liberal
democracies also had a behind-the-scenes impact on their government's
policies toward empire]{.underline}. In the nineteenth century, the
British anti--slave trade movement pressed the Parliament to abolish the
slave trade throughout the British Empire. During and after World War I,
the women's suffrage movement in the United States and Britain became
increasingly active in international affairs. The war itself affected
the lives of women, galvanizing the suffragist movement and illuminating
the role of war in modern society. Many in the movement made a direct
connection between the right to vote and campaigns for peace and
worldwide social justice.83 During the war, women's groups on both sides
of the Atlantic, led by figures such as Jane Addams and Emily Greene
Balch, actively participated in debates on the postwar settlement.84
Together, Addams and Balch became leaders of the Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom, devoted to peace education, international
dialogue, and socially progressive causes, for which they later received
the Nobel Peace Prize.85 [This group and others explicitly linked the
denial of women's rights and social justice in their societies to the
pursuit of militarism and imperialism abroad.]{.underline} During the
1940s, domestic political struggles---particularly over civil
rights---and the continuing activities of progressive movements
reinforced liberal internationalist efforts abroad. [Americans
struggling for civil rights explicitly linked their causes with
anticolonial movements.86]{.underline} The linkage showed itself, for
example, in June 1942, when Walter White, representing the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, met with Sumner
Welles and urged the Roosevelt administration to call a "Pacific
Conference" devoted to ending colonial rule in Asia. White wanted FDR to
meet with Indian leaders such as Nehru and Gandhi and the Chinese
nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek to announce America's support for
Asian statehood and national self-rule. White also suggested that, with
the "Pacific Charter" in hand, a delegation of Americans, led by Wendell
Willkie and a "distinguished American Negro whose complexion
unmistakably identifies him as being a colored man," should go to India
and announce American support for the Indian struggle."87 The idea did
not have great support in the administration. Even those who took issue
with the British Empire were unwilling to take steps that might weaken
Britain's position in the struggle with Nazi Germany. After World War
II, the American civil rights movement and social justice campaigns drew
connections between their struggles and the struggles of nationalist and
anti-imperialists abroad. In 1947, W. E. B. Du Bois used the platform of
the United Nations for "An Appeal to the World," describing the
injustices of racial segregation and inequality in the United States and
associating the struggles of African Americans with the victims of
colonialism in Africa and elsewhere. "Our treatment is not merely an
internal question for the United States," he argued, "it is a basic
problem of humanity."88 [Not only did civil rights activists appeal to
international audiences for support and solidarity, many US political
leaders also saw progress on civil rights as integral to fighting the
Cold War]{.underline}. During these decades, the American government's
relationship to civil rights legislation was shaped by the sense that it
was necessary to manage its international image. As the historian Mary
Dudziak argues, "the need to address international criticism gave the
federal government an incentive to promote social change at home."89
[The connections also ran in the other direction as the American civil
rights movement, along with other social justice advocates, put pressure
on the US government to support anticolonial causes
abroad.90]{.underline}

#### Liberalism is structurally opposed to imperialism---liberal organizations are vehicles for anti-colonial and anti-patriarchal struggle

[Third, the international organizations established after the two world
wars created platforms and capacities that experts and activists could
use in their struggles against empire]{.underline}. While the League of
Nations and, later, the United Nations helped Britain and other European
states secure what remained of their imperial holdings, they also served
as institutional sites for activism and repositories of universalistic
norms and principles that opponents of empire could deploy in their
struggles for self-rule. [Both the league and the United Nations created
institutional channels for groups that previously had little input into
diplomacy or the shaping of international rules and practices to provide
a counterweight to the old imperial order. These groups included women's
organizations, international activists, and non-Western governments and
peoples.91]{.underline} As I have noted, the Great War did not quell the
European appetite for empire, and the League of Nations was widely seen
in Europe and Great Britain as an opportunity to strengthen the prestige
and administration of imperial rule. But the league also played a
role---if a conflicted and awkward one---in moving the world toward the
end of empire and the spread of selfdetermination. "If one considers its
work in stabilizing new states and running the minorities protection and
mandates system," Susan Pedersen argues, "the League appears as a key
agent in the transition from a world of formal empires to a world of
formally sovereign states."92 Pedersen looks specifically at the
league's Permanent Mandates Commission, the system established in 1921
to manage the territories in Africa, the Middle East, and the Pacific
that Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire had lost in the
war. The mandates system did not directly alter the aims of the
remaining imperial powers, which sought to preserve their colonies and
continued to see empire as a civilizing mission. "What was new,"
Pedersen argues, "was the apparatus and the level of international
diplomacy, publicity, and 'talk' that the system brought into being."
The mandates system was a vehicle for "internationalization"---a process
"by which certain political issues and functions are displaced from the
national or imperial, and into the international realm."93 [Unintended
by its architects, the mandates system became a vehicle by which those
favoring self-determination and revision of the Versailles settlement
could press their claims. It provided a platform for internationalists,
humanitarians, nationalists, and others who sought to expose the dark
side of imperial rule.]{.underline} The wider league complex of
institutions had the same effect, drawing international commissions,
organizations, lobbyists, and experts into a sprawling and ongoing
debate about the future of European empire and the normative foundations
of statehood.94 It would take decades and another world war to bring
about a global system of sovereign states. But the league pointed the
way. India took advantage of the League of Nations to gain rights and
recognition before its independence in 1947. Great Britain, in an effort
to strengthen its presence and voting share at Versailles, overcame the
opposition of the other great powers to gain separate representation for
its dominions, including India. Although still a British dependency,
India---along with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South
Africa---actively participated in the conference's deliberations and
signed the peace treaty on the basis of "legal equality."95 Because the
Covenant of the League of Nations was part of the peace treaty, India
acquired the right to become a founding member of the league, the only
state among the thirty-one original members that was not legally
self-governing. India's internal and external relations continued to
rest with the British government, but as one observer notes, "for the
first time in the modern period, \[India\] came into direct and formal
contact with the outside world."96 Between 1919 and 1947, India's
position within the international legal system remains anomalous. While
formally not a sovereign state, India exercised treaty-making power and
participated in almost every international conference after 1920. As a
league member, India attended the Washington Conference on Naval
Armaments in 1921, signed the Washington treaty, and was admitted to the
International Labour Organization, the Permanent Court of International
Justice, and other league-related organizations. It signed numerous
multilateral treaties, including the KelloggBriand Pact of 1928.97 In
1945, India was invited to the San Francisco Conference of the United
Nations, and it became a founding member of the new world organization.
Over this period, India's self-governing status remained limited and
many Indian nationalist leaders saw their country's presence in these
international bodies as a capitulation to British imperialism.
Nonetheless, India took advantage of the status it gained over these
decades to pave the way for independence, consolidating India as a
diplomatic unit and giving its nationalist movement international
recognition.98 [The United Nations was even more explicit in
facilitating the transition away from empire. It formally enshrined the
idea of universal membership in a world of sovereign states and provided
the legal and political framework for the recognition and integration of
new states into the postimperial Westphalian order]{.underline}. As
decolonization accelerated, the United Nations rapidly expanded from 51
original members in 1945, to 100 in September 1961, and to 159 by the
end of 1985. Ironically, the United Nations is widely seen as the
embodiment of internationalist ideas, but its greatest achievement may
be the global triumph of the sovereign state system. Adam Roberts notes
the United Nations' importance in providing a framework for
decolonization: [The UN sometimes assisted the process of decolonization
through referenda, and also through General Assembly resolutions---most
notably the 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples. But its most important contribution was in
providing a framework for entry into international society of the
numerous new and reconstituted states, many of which were intensely
vulnerable. For them, the UN was not just the main means of securing
diplomatic recognition, but also a world stage, a negotiating forum, a
provider of well-paid jobs, and a source of symbolic protection. The UN
embodies principles, including racial equality and the sovereign
equality of states, that were vital to the decolonization
process.99]{.underline}

#### Liberalism is least coercive and self-reflexive

How do we square these contradictory impulses? If liberal
internationalism has offered a vision of a postimperial global order, is
it also implicated in a pattern of liberal interventionism, or liberal
imperialism? [Some critics see liberal internationalism as a fig leaf
with which elites disguise and legitimate more traditional great-power
impulses]{.underline}. The problem with liberal internationalism is that
it does not put a sufficient ideological or political brake on American
interventionism. [Other critics make an even stronger argument---that
liberalism itself drives American interventionism]{.underline}. As
ideologies and political projects, liberalism and liberal
internationalism are inherently revisionist. It is American liberalism
that leads the United States to intervene and seek to reshape other
societies. For realist critics, the liberal sources of American
interventionism look particularly striking since the end of the Cold
War, when the United States emerged unrivaled and undisciplined by the
bipolar balance of power. Equipped with unipolar power and liberal
internationalist ideas, the United States found itself supporting the
expansion of NATO and the European Union, engaging in humanitarian
intervention, projecting itself into regional conflicts and civil wars,
and pursuing violent regime change, most fatefully in the 2003 invasion
of Iraq. The suggestion is that a more realist-oriented America would
have pursued a more restrained vision of the national interest.106 [The
liberal tradition has certainly informed the conduct of American foreign
policy]{.underline}. As I noted in chapter 6, during the Cold War,
liberalism became a "fighting faith" that tied American power to a
global struggle to protect the liberal democratic world when that world
was under attack from powerful illiberal forces. [A great contest
between open societies and totalitarian challengers was an ideological
struggle but also a military and geopolitical struggle]{.underline}.
Leading liberal thinkers of the day, such as Arthur Schlesinger Jr.,
Isaiah Berlin, and Raymond Aron, considered the survival of the
democratic way of life to be at extreme risk. Western liberal
democracies had stumbled in the 1920s and 1930s by failing to respond to
the instabilities and inequalities of capitalist society. In response,
these Cold War liberals, as Jan-Werner Müller argues, sought to "craft a
principled politics of freedom for the twentieth century."107 Their view
of the threats to liberal democracy focused on both the troubled
internal politics of Western societies, where the political center was
threatened by extremism on the Right and the Left, and the wider
world-historical struggle then unfolding with the Soviet Union and
international communism. Schlesinger's influential 1949 book The Vital
Center epitomized this worldview. It offered a defense of pluralism and
open societies and called for the continuation of New Deal--style reform
by activist governments. But in response to the larger global challenge,
Schlesinger urged collective action by the liberal democracies, led by
the United States, to defend their institutions and the liberal
international order from totalitarian rivals.108 The challenge to
liberal democracy was manifest in a worldwide struggle between
alternative visions of modernity. [Cold War liberalism offered a
narrative that put liberal internationalism in the service of an
activist American foreign policy.109]{.underline} Is the American
liberal tradition inherently interventionist? Do liberal principles
predispose the United States to actively seek to impose democracy on
other states? A long tradition of realist thinking has argued that they
do. As Henry Kissinger maintains, "the idea that peace depends above all
on promoting democratic institutions has remained a staple of American
thought to the present day," and he traces this idea back to Woodrow
Wilson.110 The United States is often depicted as a "crusader state"
seeking, under the sway of liberal ideas, to remake the world in its own
image.111 More recently, realist scholars have linked American
liberalism to controversial American foreign policy actions in the wake
of the September 11 terrorist attacks, such as the doctrine justifying
preventive war and forcible regime change. [John Mearsheimer argues that
liberalism provides the impulse and legitimating rationale for repeated
episodes of American military interventionism]{.underline}. Liberal
ambitions spurred the United States to push Western institutions to the
doorsteps of Russia and China and provided the rationale for the
disastrous war in Iraq. Similarly, Michael Desch traces American
interventionism to the founding ideas of liberal internationalism. He
sees Kantian liberalism as providing the philosophical justification for
military efforts to democratize illiberal sovereign states by force. In
effect, the liberal tradition generates what David Hume called an
"imprudent vehemence" toward illiberal regimes.112 [These claims bring
the debate back to the question of whether liberalism contains an "urge"
to empire]{.underline}. Mearsheimer and Desch essentially take the view
of liberalism that is elaborated by Uday Mehta in Liberalism and Empire.
Here it is not empire but military interventionism that the leading
liberal state uses to bring backward people and regimes into the modern
world. Intervention and regime change are embedded in the assumptions
that liberalism makes about the "state of nature" and the conditions for
peace. Only when all states embrace representative government will
liberal democracies be truly safe[. But the urge to intervene to promote
democracy is clearly contingent, not absolute.]{.underline} Most liberal
internationalists would almost certainly agree that, all else being
equal, liberal democracies would be safer in a world dominated by
liberal democracies. But whether this justifies forcible regime change
is another matter. Kant's view of intervention was surely more
complicated---and contingent---than Desch admits. [Kant did believe that
a republican constitution is the ideal, he also acknowledged that even
despotic states have a claim of legitimate authority that entitles them
to nonintervention. Kant did argue that "perpetual peace" depends on all
states developing republican forms of rule, but this does not generate a
right by liberal states to bring about such a result by force.113
Michael Doyle has shown that liberalism is conflicted---even
"congenitally confused"---on the question of intervention]{.underline}.
Liberalism embraces principles that are in tension with each other. [On
one hand, liberal principles accord all states, including illiberal
states, the right to noninterference, even when these states inflict
harm on their own populations or violate their rights. On the other
hand, liberalism also emphasizes that the rights of individuals in these
societies must also be respected, and this opens the door---at least
under extreme conditions---to intervention.114]{.underline} Doyle argues
that Kant "made a strong case for respecting the right of
non-intervention because it afforded a polity the necessary territorial
space and political independence in which free and equal citizens could
work out what their way of life would be."115 But Kant could also
imagine polities that so abused their people---committing massacres or
genocide, for example---that the duty of nonintervention would not
apply. [This contingency, of course, raises the question of how liberal
states should decide whether and how to respond.]{.underline} Liberalism
thus offers arguments for and against intervention. Georg Sørensen has
described these alternative logics as the "liberalism of imposition" and
the "liberalism of restraint."116 [The liberalism of imposition is
manifest in the state's employment of power to expand liberal
principles]{.underline}. John Stuart Mill argues this position when he
writes that noncivilized societies---which he calls "barbarous"
nations---do not observe the rules and traditions of international
morality, and therefore their independence does not merit full respect.
[Liberalism of restraint, Sørensen argues, stresses a different set of
liberal values, such as "pluralism, non-intervention, respect for
others, moderation, and peaceful cooperation on equal
terms."117]{.underline} This is the vision that Gerry Simpson has called
"charter liberalism," with its values embodied in the United Nations
Charter. [States are accorded equality of treatment, their sovereign
independence is respected, and each state is allowed to determine how to
establish its own rights and protections.118 Restraint liberals
recognize that some states will violate basic rights, but until some
extreme line of violence and genocide is crossed diversity is tolerated,
in the belief that over the long run, these societies will evolve toward
universal standards of rights and decency.119]{.underline} These debates
within the liberal tradition burned fiercely during the years
surrounding the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq. How much was
liberal internationalism implicated in this decision? The Bush
administration articulated a sweeping new doctrine of national security
based on American global dominance, the preventive use of force,
"coalitions of the willing," and the struggle between freedom and
tyranny. [In the spring of 2003, this doctrine provided the intellectual
backdrop for the invasion of Iraq. As the invasion turned into a
protracted war, the Bush administration increasingly invoked liberal
internationalist ideas to justify its actions]{.underline}. In his now
famous second inaugural address, George W. Bush stood on the steps of
the US Capitol and proclaimed, "We are led, by events and common sense,
to one conclusion: the survival of liberty in our land increasingly
depends on the success of liberty in other lands."120 The echoes of
Woodrow Wilson and the Cold War liberal internationalism of Truman and
Kennedy were unmistakable. But was Bush truly Wilson's heir? Liberal
internationalists themselves debate this issue.121 Some argue that Bush
followed a "neoconservative" stand of liberal internationalism, focused
on putting the full weight of American power behind bringing the
"blessings of liberty" to oppressed people.122 [Others argue that this
neoconservative turn in American foreign policy was a distortion of
liberal internationalism and that the Bush grand strategy was more
imperial than liberal.]{.underline} Multilateralism is at the heart of
the liberal international vision, these people argue, but the Bush
administration willfully put the United States above the rules and
institutions of the liberal order. In the long run, liberal democracies
will be safer and more secure in an international order undergirded by
shared rules and norms, cooperative security, and mutual restraint---and
the Bush administration was undermining such an order.123 Liberal
internationalists clearly differ on the importance of democracy
promotion to their project, and on whether democracy is best promoted
through force or example.124 But were the ideological origins of the
Iraq War really traceable to liberal internationalism? [The principal
architects of this ill-fated venture were, by all accounts, Vice
President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Deputy
Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz.125 It is difficult to describe the
political ideology of any of these officials as liberal
internationalism]{.underline}. For all three, the primary objective of
the war was the preservation and extension of American primacy in a
region important to American national interests. [They saw Iraq as a
regional revisionist state with a demonstrated record of
chemical-weapons use and a long-standing ambition to acquire nuclear
weapons, making it a military threat to American forces and allies in
the region]{.underline}. The decisive defeat of Iraq was also meant to
provide a worldwide demonstration of America's capacities and
willingness to defend its global position against challengers such as
North Korea and Iran and to dispel lingering doubts created during the
Clinton years about America's willingness to use force. In the decade
before the war, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Wolfowitz had all been associated
with efforts to enunciate a post--Cold War American grand strategy of
preventing the emergence of a peer competitor.126 All three had publicly
urged the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime for more than a decade
before the 2003 invasion. Their utterances betrayed no trace of liberal
internationalism. [Put simply, the Bush administration's policy in Iraq
was decidedly realist.]{.underline} Prominent academic realists opposed
the war, offering eloquent critiques of American hubris and grand
strategy.127 But the case for war was also argued, at least initially,
in realist terms. Democracy promotion was among the rolling rationales
for the war offered by the Bush administration, but it is difficult to
believe that this goal was the originating impulse for the war. It is
more plausibly seen as the administration's public justification for the
war and possibly a template for postwar Iraqi reconstruction. [Democracy
was not a core objective: it emerged later, as a program for making Iraq
into a pillar of the hegemonic American order in the
region.128]{.underline} Some liberal internationalists supported the war
and others opposed it, but many of those supporters were less focused on
democracy promotion than on the genuinely frightening threats that
weapons of mass destruction posed and on the search for responses to
this threat when deterrence and arms control were not effective. (It
turned out, of course, that the reason Hussein could not be persuaded to
give up his weapons of mass destruction was that he had nothing to give
up, and he wanted to hide this fact from neighboring enemies like Iran.)
Finding cooperative solutions to rising problems of security
interdependence was at the top of the post--September 11 liberal
internationalist agenda, but it tended to get lost in the controversies
over the Iraq War.129 Even if one could disentangle American liberalism
from power politics, it is not clear that a purely realist-oriented
foreign policy would be more restrained or enlightened. [There is no
necessary link between liberal internationalism and coercive regime
change. Liberalism may provide reasons to intervene abroad, but it also
provides ideological and institutional mechanisms that restrain the
exercise of military power]{.underline}. Realist critics think they can
prevent another Iraq by removing liberal internationalist ideas from
policymaking. But liberal internationalism also inspired the building of
the wider system of postwar rules, institutions, and partnerships.
Realists cannot assume that this system would have been built in a
purely realist world of offshore balancing. [If the goal is a
"restrained" foreign policy, the postwar system of rules and
institutions that ties the liberal democracies together under shared
commitments and rules of conduct is surely part of the solution and not
the problem.130]{.underline} A large part of the resistance to the Bush
administration's war in Iraq was based on standards of conduct that the
United States had championed. Western Europeans, for example, criticized
the war as a transgression of liberal internationalist notions of
sovereignty, multilateralism, and international law. Two scholars have
called this "liberal anti-Americanism."131 [If military interventionism
is not inherent in either liberalism or realism, the question comes down
to the quality of political institutions and decision making. Does the
United States learn from its mistakes? The lack of enthusiasm for new
Iraqi-style interventions does suggest that foreign policy decision
makers---liberal internationalists or not--- do rethink their
views.]{.underline}

### A2 US Bad

#### US liberalism was key to anti-imperial struggle---opposition to imperial powers and building platforms for state sovereignty

[Finally, the deepest and most far-reaching force separating liberalism
from empire has been the struggle over the global expansion of the
Westphalian state system. A world of sovereign states was a precondition
for the spread of liberal internationalism. Therefore, the struggle to
extend sovereign rights of statehood to peoples and nations was the real
bulwark against empire]{.underline}. By building on and reinforcing this
grand shift from empire to the nation-state, liberal internationalism
ultimately placed its "project" within the Westphalian system---it
became, in a sense, the set of ideas for organizing the world once the
world finally shed its imperial foundations. Empire had ordered the
world for centuries, and when the twentieth century asked what would
replace empire as the world's organizing logic, liberal internationalism
stepped forward as the alternative. How the Westphalian state system
came to encompass the world is a question that still requires scholarly
attention.100 The sovereign state arrived quite late for most regions
outside the West---essentially in the twentieth century, after the world
wars. [For most of the past five hundred years, European great powers
were not eager to export or universalize the Westphalian order. They
held on to empire and colonies until forced to give them up. In this
sense, the spread of Westphalia is not a story of the imposition of a
Western idea on the rest of the world, but of the failure of the
European state system to sustain empire.101 To pursue movements for
independence and selfdetermination on their own, peoples and societies
outside Europe took advantage of the cracks and clashes in the European
imperial system.]{.underline} As noted earlier, Edward Keene argues that
great wars between liberal and totalitarian states discredited the old
civilizational vision of sovereignty and imperial hierarchy. Christian
Reus-Smit finds, in the universalization of norms of sovereignty and
self-determination after two hundred years of struggles over individual
rights, a story of the "evolution and transmission of the legitimating
institutions that sustain sovereignty."102 This surely is part of the
explanation. But it remains to be explained why empires, as a form of
global order, failed. John Darwin argues that empires have tended to
fail for four reasons: "external defeat or geopolitical weakness;
ideological contagion and the loss of legitimacy; domestic enfeeblement
at the centre of empire---the loss of political will and economic
capacity; and colonial revolt."103 All of these triggers of imperial
crisis seemed to be present in the twentieth century. Considered as wars
of empire, the world wars decisively weakened and brought to an end the
European system of empire. [In this drama, the United States played an
important role in both undercutting empire and promoting the Westphalian
state system. It did this first during the two world wars, by joining
and later leading coalitions of allies that ultimately defeated states
with expansive imperial projects]{.underline}. In World War I it was
Imperial Germany, which had conquered a large area of Eastern Europe and
seized much of the Russian Empire's western territories. This war
resulted in the collapse of four long-established European empires:
Romanov Russia, Habsburg Austria-Hungary, Hohenzollern Germany, and
Ottoman Turkey. World War II effectively finished off the Japanese
empire and severely weakened the British and French empires, though the
latter two, because they were on the winning side, took a couple of
decades to dissolve. During the Cold War, the United States also engaged
in balancing against the Soviet Union---seeking to contain the expansion
of Soviet power and influence as well as thwarting communist coups and
revolutions in many weak, independent states. [At the same time, as
noted earlier, the United States played a variety of roles in
facilitating states' ability to survive as independent members of
international society. It led efforts to institutionalize Westphalian
norms of nonaggression and sovereign independence, first with the League
of Nations and then with the United Nations Charter]{.underline}. In the
second half of the twentieth century, the American-led international
order institutionalized open trade and multilateral cooperation,
providing the infrastructure for a global economic system, which in turn
strengthened the smaller states' ability to sustain their sovereignty.
[Also in the second half of the twentieth century, the American system
of military alliances dampened violent conflicts among allied states,
particularly in Europe and East Asia, and this prevented the Westphalian
system from falling back into violent conflict and empire building.104
Thus the "American century" was also the century of the global spread of
the nation-state.]{.underline} They were different political projects,
but each helped the other gain ground.
