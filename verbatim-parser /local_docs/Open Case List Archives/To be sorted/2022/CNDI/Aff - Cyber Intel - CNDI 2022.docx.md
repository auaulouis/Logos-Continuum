[Malicious cyber activity has **increased substantially** over the past
years]{.underline} while the world has kept turning amid the omnipresent
pandemic and now war in Ukraine. [States, non-state actors, and criminal
groups]{.underline} compete and [are]{.underline} increasingly
[weaponizing]{.underline} sensitive information [and infiltrating other
countries' networks]{.underline} [to]{.underline} steal data, seed
misinformation, or [disrupt critical infrastructure]{.underline}. [The
coronavirus pandemic further complicated the cyber-threat
landscape]{.underline}. In March 2020, attempts to mitigate the spread
of the coronavirus led to social distancing measures, travel
restrictions, and remote work. In a short span of time, IT security
professionals had to respond to the challenges of working from home,
such as enterprise data movements when employees accessed cloud-based
apps via their home internet, corporate software, videoconferencing, and
file sharing.11ENISA: European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, The Year
in Review. ENISA Threat Landscape from January 2019 to April 2020, 2020.
Even if hardware and software solutions were in place to secure the
organization's data, there were often no established policies to help
employees wade through the jungle of threats and vulnerabilities they
faced when moving their workplace out of the traditional office
environment.22NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence,
Recent Cyber Events: Considerations for Military and National Security
Decision Makers, No. 10, May 2021.¶ According to the FireEye Mandiant
Special Report: M-Trends 2021, the top five most targeted industries in
2020 were business and professional services, retail and hospitality,
finance, healthcare, and high technology. The main methods used were
extortion, ransom demands, payment card theft, and illicit transfers.
Direct financial gain was the likely motive for 36% of intrusions, and
an additional 2% of intrusions were likely perpetrated to resell access.
In 2021, data theft remained an important mission objective for threat
actors; in 32% of intrusions, adversaries stole data.33Fire Eye Mandiant
Services, Special Report, M-Trends 2021, pp. 17-19.Currently, highly
organized, technically proficient [criminal syndicates comprise the most
significant cyber threat to allies. These groups try to steal data or
extort money through ransomware]{.underline}. In 2021, prominent
ransomware attacks struck Colonial Pipeline, the operator of the largest
fuel pipeline on the East Coast of the United States; JBS, the largest
meat processing company in North America; and Coop, a major supermarket
chain in Sweden. Healthcare was also targeted---in May of the same year,
the entire health service system of Ireland was disrupted for weeks, and
over the spring and summer, dozens of hospitals in Europe and the United
States were locked out of life-critical systems by ransomware
attacks.44Ciaran Martin, "Cyber Criminals Will Cause Physical Harm,"
Wired, February 2, 2022 [Another set of threats comes in the form of
belligerent state actors that seek to steal sensitive data for
espionage]{.underline}. In December 2020, [Russian intelligence services
infiltrated the digital systems run by US tech firm SolarWinds and
inserted malware]{.underline} into its code. During the company's next
software update, the virus was inadvertently spread to about 18,000
clients, including large corporations, the Pentagon, the State
Department, Homeland Security, the Treasury, and other US government
agencies. The hack went undetected for months before the victims
discovered vast amounts of their data had been stolen.55Jack Stubbs,
Raphael Satter, and Joseph Menn, "US Homeland Security, thousands of
businesses scramble after suspected Russian hack," December 14, 2020.
[There are also politically motivated cyberattacks mandated by states
that interfere in democratic processes]{.underline} and political
discourse. In September 2020, the internal email system of Norway's
parliament was hacked.66Catalin Cimpanu, "Finland says hackers accessed
MPs' email accounts," ZDNet, December 28, 2020. Ine Eriksen Søreide, the
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Norway, underlined the significance of
the attack by calling it an important cyber incident that affected the
"most important democratic institution" of the country.77BBC, "Norway
blames Russia for cyberattack on parliament," October 13, 2020.
Norwegian authorities later identified Russia as the actor responsible
for the attack, marking the first time that Norwegian authorities had
made a political attribution to such an attack.¶ Since the beginning of
this year, [Ukraine's government has been hit by a series of
cyberattacks that]{.underline} defaced government websites and [wiped
out]{.underline} the [data]{.underline} on some government computers. In
mid-January, hackers defaced about 70 Ukrainian websites, including the
Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defense, Energy, Education, and Science,
as well as the State Emergency Service and the Ministry of Digital
Transformation, whose e-governance portal gives the Ukrainian public
digital access to dozens of government services. The hackers replaced
the home pages of about a dozen sites with a threatening message: "be
afraid and expect worse." After a couple of days, however, most of the
sites were restored.88Kim Zetter, "What We Know and Don't Know about the
Cyberattacks Against Ukraine," Substack, January 17, 2022. The
international hacktivist collective Anonymous has declared "cyberwar"
against Russia's government, claiming credit for several cyber incidents
including distributed denial of service attacks that took down Russian
government websites and Russia Today, the state-backed news
service.99Monica Buchanan Pitrelli, "Global hacking group Anonymous
launches 'cyber war' against Russia," CNBC, March 4, 2022. Around the
globe, **[aging critical infrastructure has long been vulnerable to
attack]{.underline}**. [The most worrying type of cyberattack
is]{.underline} sophisticated [malware]{.underline} designed by states
or state-backed actors **[that act as "time bombs" in the critical cyber
networks of target countries, such as the energy, telecom, and
transportation sectors]{.underline}**. Around the globe, [aging critical
infrastructure has long been vulnerable]{.underline} to attack. In 2020,
the UK's National Cyber Security Centre issued a warning of Russian
attacks on millions of routers, firewalls, and devices used by
infrastructure operators and government agencies.1010Alix Pressley, "The
'cumulative effect' of ransomware and the lessons for UK national
infrastructure," Intelligent Cio, July 20, 2021. On the day of the
Russian invasion, ViaSat, a provider of high-speed satellite broadband
services, was hacked along with one of its satellites Ka-Sat, whose
users included Ukraine's armed forces, police, and intelligence service.
Destructive wiper malware attacks by Russia against Ukraine included

that "provide critical executive branch or emergency response
functions";1111Microsoft Security, Destructive malware targeting

CaddyWiper, spotted by researchers at the Slovak internet security
company ESET in mid-March.1313ESET Research, CaddyWiper: New wiper
malware discovered in Ukraine, March 15, 2022. [All of them were
designed to wipe or overwrite critical files on infected systems and
leave computer hard drives corrupted and unrecoverable. These incidents
demonstrate that]{.underline}, in the words of cyber expert and
Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank chairman Dmitri Alperovich,
"**[Cyberattacks have become a theater for great-power conflict in which
governments and militaries fight in the hybrid 'gray
zone]{.underline}**,' where the boundaries between peace and war are
blurred."1414Dmitri Alperovitch, "How Russia Has Turned Ukraine Into a
Cyber-Battlefield," Foreign Affairs, January 28, 2022. The actors
navigate a complex web of ambiguous and deeply interconnected
challenges, where c[yberattacks]{.underline} [are]{.underline} not a
separate front, but rather [an extension of the conflict.]{.underline}
While they can offer some advantages in military operations,
cyberattacks also have limitations in feasibility and effect. In the
event of military attacks, military objectives can be supported by
intelligence-gathering operations, operations aimed at disrupting the
opponent's military, and psychological operations against the opponent's
public.1515Ibid. Nevertheless, sophisticated cyberattacks require a lot
of luck, but also skill and time---for example, the 75-minute power
outage in 2016 in Kyiv took 31 months to prepare.1616Ciaran Martin,
"Cyber Realism in a Time of War," Lawfare, March 2, 2022. [The Russian
military exercise]{.underline} Zapad 2021 in September [included one of
the largest uses of electronic warfare, which has been increasingly on
display in eastern Ukraine]{.underline} since 2014 and in Syria since
2015. Roger McDermott, a leading analyst on Russian military
developments has described that "**[Russia's growing technological
advances in EW \[electronic warfare\] will allow its forces to jam,
disrupt, and interfere with NATO communications, radar and other sensor
systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other
assets.]{.underline}**"1717Roger McDermott, "Russia's Electronic Warfare
Capabilities to 2025," ICDS, September 2017. [Russia sees EW as a
seamless whole, ranging from kinetic combat operations on the
battlefield to missions in cyberspac]{.underline}e and the information
domain.1818Jonathan Marcus, "Zapad: What can we learn from Russia\'s
latest military exercise?" BBC, September 20, 2017. While there were no
public sources confirming any navigation or communications disruption by
the Baltic-Polish defense leadership during Zapad 2021, **[it is
nevertheless important that NATO continue to adapt to the evolving
cyber-threat landscape]{.underline}**.

#### Status quo NATO efforts aren't enough -- [deterrence, defense, and interoperability]{.underline} are failing because of a [lack of coordination]{.underline}. 

**Blessing '21** (Dr. Jason Blessing is a Research Fellow at the
American Enterprise Institute and a returning DAAD Postdoctoral Fellow
at the Foreign Policy Institute of Johns. "Fail-Deadly, Fail-Safe, and
Safe-to-Fail: The Strategic Necessity of Resilience in the Cyber
Domain," Chapter 12 in NATO 2030: Towards A New Strategic Concept and
Beyond, SAIS Press, 2021,
<https://www.sais.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/NATO2030AndBeyondAccessibleVersion.pdf)-mikee>

There are, however, [several dynamics]{.underline} that [reveal the
**limits** of the fail-deadly and fail-safe logics **underlying NATO's**
collective defense initiatives]{.underline}. [In short, these strategic
logics only apply to a narrow set of threats]{.underline}; they will not
apply to the full spectrum of threats presented by the cyber domain.
[Fail-deadly deterrence is only likely to succeed in preventing
state-level adversaries]{.underline} from undertaking resource-intensive
cyber operations [that reach the threshold of armed conflict with
physical,]{.underline} destructive effects and that are quickly
attributable.38 [Fail-safe defensive measures also face several
political and technical challenges]{.underline}, all of which point to a
role for cyber resilience. Three main complications limit the
applicability of the fail-deadly logics underpinning collective defense
efforts in cyberspace. The first is deciding which actors are to be
deterred. Compared to traditional warfighting domains, there are
relatively low entry costs for conducting operations in the cyber
domain.39 As such, both state and non-state actors can target the
Alliance. [There are also asymmetric operational costs---actors are
faced with multiple avenues for potential gains and few
risks]{.underline}. [This means that it will be near-impossible to
change the decision calculus of a malicious actor deploying low-cost,
low-risk techniques such as distributed denials of service]{.underline}.
Conversely, sophisticated cyber operations that can produce strategic
effects equivalent to those of conventional military attacks will have
both significant and costly intelligence requirements that can only be
borne by state actors. These higher 'start-up' costs mean it may be
possible to change the decision calculus of actors seeking to conduct
highly sophisticated cyber operations. [Due to this asymmetry, only
state actors undertaking costly cyber operations are likely to be
deterred]{.underline}. In all other circumstances, deterrence will be
more prone to failure.40 Attribution difficulties present further
challenges to the 'who' of deterrence. Adversaries with rapidly changing
tactics, techniques, and procedures---along with the ability to easily
conceal an operation's origin and perpetrator---can pose hurdles to
technical attribution.41 [Technical difficulties can weaken deterrent
postures by delaying the timeliness of retaliatory
punishment.]{.underline} Moreover, the effects of an operation that a
defender notices may actually be second- or third-order effects. This
can add additional time between attribution and punishment.42 [The
larger attribution issues]{.underline}, however, are
[political.]{.underline} [NATO lacks common standards or guidance for
attributing cyber operations in either a technical or political
sense]{.underline}. Indeed, attribution remains a member state
prerogative. Not only are the targeted member states responsible for
attribution, but those members looking to contribute to collective
defense must perform independent attribution assessments, and the
political decision for a collective defense response must come from the
NAC.43 [Reaching a consensus decision to trigger collective defense in
response to cyberspace operations is likely to be politically
contentious, and member states will have few incentives to risk
revealing the intelligence sources and methods that underlie attribution
decisions.]{.underline} These dynamics are likely to intensify when
additional links in the attribution chain are required, such as when a
perpetrator is encouraged or sponsored by an adversarial state but lacks
direct ties. Attribution is less likely to be politically controversial
across the Alliance once a conventional conflict is underway as
contextual clues from kinetic attacks can reduce uncertainty. This
discussion points to a greater role for deterrence-by-denial. Deterring
an adversary by taking measures to deny potential gains does not hinge
on attribution and thus possesses a potentially wider scope of
application.44 A second and related hurdle for cyber deterrence is
determining which actions the Alliance seeks to deter. Much of the
activity in cyberspace falls below the physical effects thresholds
associated with the disruption, degradation, or destruction of computers
and networks. Such considerations complicate decisions to invoke Article
5---specifically, the types of cyberattacks to which Article 5 should
apply. Indeed, cyber operations targeting military assets or critical
civilian infrastructure can be incredibly costly but may not reach
damage levels associated with conventional attacks.45 Moreover,
espionage via network exploitation is widespread, varied, and falls well
below the threshold of armed conflict.46 Problematically, such
exploitation can be nearly indistinguishable from operations that
eventually seek to attack computers or networks and produce effects.
Network exploitation can even be precursor to conventional military
operations.47 Determining how to deter presents a third obstacle to
NATO's cyber deterrence efforts. Threatening conventional military means
in response to cyber operations poses dilemmas of proportionality and
can risk unintended escalation.48 [Retaliation with cyber tools carry
their own problems. First, the Alliance faces issues of political
reliability, particularly in the context of the SCEPVA
framework.]{.underline} [Legally, Allies retain different constitutional
restraints on offensive cyber operations that can hamper the ability to
volunteer sovereign effects]{.underline}. Strategically, states may be
hesitant to volunteer their 'best' cyber effects for fear of burning an
exploit that could have had a greater payoff when used in a national
context. Volunteering sovereign effects can also inadvertently give
unwanted insight to an adversary regarding an Ally's techniques,
tactics, and procedures. Second, the temporary and transient nature of
cyber capabilities makes it incredibly difficult to establish repeatable
and predictable effects required of deterrent threats.49 Finally,
signaling in cyberspace is generally ambiguous and rarely
straightforward.50 For instance, an adversary may not even recognize a
signal, believing it instead to be a technical glitch. Even if a costly
signal is received, there is no way to ensure that it has interpreted as
intended. In addition to deterrence, NATO's fail-safe cyber defense
efforts face political and technical challenges. [Because NATO will not
undertake any active defense measures, **actions to mitigate the effects
of a cyberattack are limited** to NATO networks or to individual member
state networks when requested. This fore**closes the possibility of
developing an institutional strategy to mitigate** the costs of a
cyberattack upstream by disrupting the source of an attack, much like US
Cyber Command does with its "defend forward" posture]{.underline}.51
[**More problematically**, Allies have and will continue to have
different legal, strategic, doctrinal, and threat frameworks for
cyberspace that complicate defensive measures for the
Alliance]{.underline}. Most immediately this means that Allies will
locate resources to different aspects of cyber defense based on
individual country circumstances. Different strategic focuses have the
potential to intensify disparate threat perceptions, capabilities, and
skillsets. **[This can also exacerbate interoperability
problems]{.underline}**; for example, during an operation or crisis,
some systems will be controlled by NATO while others will be controlled
by an ally or a group of allies with different skill and knowledge
levels. In the longer term, disparate legal understandings, particularly
regarding sovereignty in cyberspace, will become more impactful as a
greater number of allied nations develop forward defense strategies and
the requisite capabilities for out-of-network operations. An
out-of-network operation can in and of itself cause operational
friction. However, differing definitions of sovereignty in
cyberspace---and what violates it---inevitably create political friction
between Allies as some look to operate and produce effects on other
Allies' networks.52 This political friction will contribute to even
greater hesitancy over cyber-intelligence sharing and complicate the
coordination of defensive mitigation measures across the Alliance. Even
if political barriers were removed, there are technical challenges to
Allied implementation of fail-safe measures. Although there are
conditions that can favor defense, such as the ability to manipulate the
environment,53 offensive cyber operations can be both unpredictable and
undetectable. [Moreover, cyberspace presents a large and complex attack
surface, where attacks can have unintended, cross-border effects. Given
the sheer quantity of daily network probes experienced by NATO and
individual member states, it is unlikely that every intrusion can be
successfully countered or even identified]{.underline}. Highly
sophisticated cyber operations are also likely to evade most defensive
measures. [Finally, fail-safe measures cannot effectively mitigate
supply chain risks, as computers and systems increasingly rely on
commercially available products and internationally based
manufacturers]{.underline}. Defensive strategies will have limited
utility if hardware or software components have been preloaded with
malware.54 [Each of these technical hurdles can contribute to slow-downs
in decision-making, coordination, and response times for the Alliance
while highlighting the need for greater resilience.]{.underline}

\*\*\*END FOOTNOTE\*\*\* the same strategic logic that leads us to view
cyberwar as a limited political instrument in most situations also leads
us to view it as incredibly destabilizing in rare situations. In a
recent Israeli wargame of a regional scenario involving the United
States and Russia, one participant remarked on "how quickly
**[[localized]{.underline}]{.mark}** [cyber [events]{.mark} can
[turn]{.mark} **dangerously [kinetic]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[when
leaders are ill-prepared]{.underline}]{.mark} to deal in the cyber
domain" \[17\]. Importantly, [this sort of **catalytic instability**
arises not from the cyber domain itself but through its interaction with
forces and characteristics in other domains]{.underline} (land, sea,
air, etc.). [Further, it arises]{.underline} only in situations [where
actors possess, and are willing to use, robust]{.underline}
[**traditional military force**s]{.underline} to defend their interests.
**[Classical]{.underline}** [deterrence theory developed to explain
nuclear deterrence with nuclear weapons, but]{.underline} different
types of weapons or **[combinations]{.underline}** of operations in
different domains can [have]{.underline} **[differential
effects]{.underline}** on deterrence and defense \[18, 19\]. [Nuclear
weapons and cyber operations are]{.underline} particularly
**[complementary]{.underline}** (i.e. nearly complete opposites) [with
respect to their strategic characteristics.]{.underline} [Theorists and
practitioners have stressed the unprecedented
**destructiveness**]{.underline} [of nuclear weapons in explaining how
nuclear deterrence works, but it is equally, if not more, important for
deterrence that capabilities and intentions are]{.underline} **[clearly
communicated]{.underline}**. As quickly became apparent, **[public
displays]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} their [nuclear arsenals
improved deterrence.x At the same time, disclosing]{.underline}
**[details]{.underline}** of a nation's nuclear capabilities [did not
much degrade the ability to strike or retaliate, given that defense
against nuclear attack remains extremely difficult.]{.underline}
Knowledge of nuclear capabilities is necessary to achieve a deterrent
effect \[20\]. [**Cyber** operations, in contrast, rely on **undisclosed
vulnerabilities**]{.underline}, social engineering, and creative guile
to generate indirect effects in the information systems that coordinate
military, economic, and social behavior. Revelation enables crippling
countermeasures, while the imperative to conceal capabilities constrains
both the scope of cyber operations and their utility for coercive
signaling \[21, 22\]. The diversity of cyber operations and confusion
about their effects also contrast with the obvious destructiveness of
nuclear weapons. The problem is that [transparency and
deception]{.underline} [**do not mix well**. [An attacker who
hacks]{.mark} an adversary's [nuclear **c**]{.mark}ommand [and
**c**]{.mark}ontrol apparatus, or the weapons themselves, [will gain an
**advantage**]{.mark} **in warfighting**]{.underline} [that the
attacker]{.underline} [**cannot reveal**, while the **adversary** will
**continue to believe it wields a deterrent that may no longer
exist.**]{.underline} [Most analyses of inadvertent escalation from
cyber or conventional to nuclear war focus on "use it or lose it"
pressures and fog of war]{.underline} created by attacks that become
visible to the target \[23, 24\]. [In a US--China conflict scenario, for
example, conventional military strikes in conjunction with cyber attacks
that blind sensors and confuse decision making could [generate
incentives for both sides to rush to preempt or
escalate]{.mark}]{.underline} \[25--27\]. These are plausible concerns,
but the revelation of information about a newly unfavorable balance of
power might also cause hesitation and lead to compromise. Cyber blinding
could potentially make traditional offensive operations more difficult,
shifting the advantage to defenders and making conflict less likely.
**[[Clandestine attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that remain invisible to
the target]{.underline} potentially [present a]{.underline} **[[more
insidious threat to crisis stability]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There are
empirical and theoretical reasons for taking seriously the effects of
offensive cyber operations on nuclear deterrence, and we should expect
the dangers to vary with the relative cyber capabilities of the actors
in a crisis interaction. Nuclear command and control vulnerability
General Robert Kehler, commander of US Strategic Command (STRATCOM) in
2013, stated in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee,
"we are very concerned with the potential of a cyber-related attack on
our nuclear command and control and on the weapons systems themselves"
\[28\]. Nuclear command, control, and communications ([NC3]{.underline})
[form the nervous system of the nuclear enterprise]{.underline} spanning
intelligence and early warning sensors located in orbit and on Earth,
fixed and mobile command and control centers through which national
leadership can order a launch, operational nuclear forces including
strategic bombers, land-based intercontinental missiles (ICBMs),
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and the communication and
transportation networks that tie the whole apparatus together \[29,
30\]. [NC3 should ideally ensure that nuclear forces will **always be
available** if **authorized**]{.underline} [by the National Command
Authority (to **enhance deterrence**) and never used]{.underline}
**[without authorization]{.underline}** ([to enhance **safety** and
**reassurance**]{.underline}). **[Friendly errors]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[enemy interference]{.underline}** [in NC3 can
**undermine the "always-never" criterion**]{.underline}**, [weakening
deterrence]{.underline}** \[31, 32\]. [NC3 has long been recognized as
the **weakest link** in the US nuclear enterprise]{.underline}.
According to a declassified official history, a Strategic Air Command
(SAC) task group in 1979 "reported that tactical warning and
communications systems ... were 'fragile' and susceptible to electronic
countermeasures, electromagnetic pulse, and sabotage, which could deny
necessary warning and assessment to the National Command Authorities"
\[33\]. Two years later, the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense
for Research and Engineering released a broad-based, multiservice report
that doubled down on SAC's findings: "the United States could not assure
survivability, endurability, or connectivity of the national command
authority function" due to: major command, control, and communications
deficiencies: in tactical warning and attack assessment where existing
systems were vulnerable to disruption and destruction from
electromagnetic pulse, other high altitude nuclear effects, electronic
warfare, sabotage, or physical attack; in decision making where there
was inability to assure national command authority survival and
connection with the nuclear forces, especially under surprise
conditions; and in communications systems, which were susceptible to the
same threats above and which could not guarantee availability of even
minimum-essential capability during a protracted war. \[33\] [The
nuclear weapons safety literature]{.underline} likewise [provides a
**number of** troubling **examples** of **NC3 glitches**]{.underline}
[that illustrate some of the **vulnerabilities** attackers
**could**]{.underline}, in principle, **[exploit]{.underline}**
\[34--36\]. The SAC history noted that **[NORAD]{.underline}** [has
received **numerous false launch indications**]{.underline} from faulty
computer components, [**loose circuits**, and even a **nuclear war
training tape** loaded by mistake into a live system that produced
erroneous Soviet launch indications]{.underline} \[33\]. In a 1991
briefing to the STRATCOM commander, a Defense Intelligence Agency
targeteer confessed, "Sir, I apologize, but we have found a problem with
this target. There is a mistake in the computer code ... . Sir, the
error has been there for at least the life of this eighteen-month
planning cycle. The nature of the error is such that the target would
not have been struck" \[37\]. It would be a difficult operation to
intentionally plant undetected errors like this, but [the presence of
bugs does reveal that]{.underline} such **[a hack is
possible]{.underline}**. [Following many near-misses and
self-audits]{.underline} during and after the Cold War, [American NC3
improved with the addition of new safeguards and
redundancies]{.underline}. As General Kehler pointed out in 2013, "the
nuclear deterrent force was designed to operate through the most extreme
circumstances we could possibly imagine" \[28\]. Yet vulnerabilities
remain. In 2010, the US Air Force lost contact with 50 Minuteman III
ICBMs for an hour because of a faulty hardware circuit at a launch
control center \[38\]. If the accident had occurred during a crisis, or
the component had been sabotaged, the USAF would have been unable to
launch and unable to detect and cancel unauthorized launch attempts. As
Bruce Blair, a former Minuteman missileer, points out, during a control
center blackout the antennas at unmanned silos and the cables between
them provide potential surreptitious access vectors \[39\]. The
unclassified summary of a 2015 audit of US NC3 stated that "known
capability gaps or deficiencies remain" \[40\]. Perhaps more worrisome
are the unknown deficiencies. A 2013 Defense Science Board report on
military cyber vulnerabilities found that while the: nuclear deterrent
is regularly evaluated for reliability and readiness ... , most of the
systems have not been assessed (end-to-end) against a \[sophisticated
state\] cyber attack to understand possible weak spots. A 2007 Air Force
study addressed portions of this issue for the ICBM leg of the U.S.
triad but was still not a complete assessment against a high-tier
threat. \[41\] [If NC3 **vulnerabilities** are unknown, it is also
**unknown** whether]{.underline} [an **advanced cyber actor** would be
able to **exploit** them.]{.underline} As Kehler notes, "**[We don't
know what we don't know]{.underline}**" \[28\]. [Even if NC3 of nuclear
forces narrowly conceived is a hard target, cyber [attacks on]{.mark}
**other [critical infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline} in preparation
to or [during a nuclear crisis could **complicate** or **confuse
government decision making**]{.underline}. General Keith Alexander,
Director of the NSA in the same Senate hearing with General Kehler,
testified that: [our infrastructure that we ride on, the [**power**
and]{.mark} the **[comm]{.mark}**unication**[s]{.mark}** grid, are one
of the things that is a source of concern ... we can go to backup
generators and we can have independent routes, but ... our ability to

further emphasized that "there's a continuing need to make sure that we
are protected against electromagnetic pulse and any kind of
electromagnetic interference" \[28\]. Many NC3 components are antiquated
and hard to upgrade, which is a mixed blessing. Kehler points out,
"[Much of the nuclear command and control system today is the legacy
system]{.underline} that we've had. [In some ways that helps us in terms
of the cyber threat. In some cases it's point to point, hard-wired,
which makes it very difficult for an external]{.underline} cyber [threat
to emerge]{.underline}" \[28\]. The Government Accountability Office
notes that the "Department of Defense uses 8-inch floppy disks in a
legacy system that coordinates the operational functions of the nation's
nuclear forces" \[42\]. While this may limit some forms of remote
access, [it is also indicative of reliance on an earlier generation of
software when **security** engineering standards were **less
mature**]{.underline}. Upgrades to the digital Strategic Automated
Command and Control System planned for 2017 have the potential to
correct some problems, but these changes may also introduce new access
vectors and vulnerabilities \[43\]. Admiral Cecil Haney, Kehler's
successor at STRATCOM, highlighted the challenges of NC3 modernization
in 2015: Assured and reliable NC3 is fundamental to the credibility of
our nuclear deterrent. The aging NC3 systems continue to meet their
intended purpose, but risk to mission success is increasing as key
elements of the system age. The unpredictable challenges posed by
today's complex security environment make it increasingly important to
optimize our NC3 architecture while leveraging new technologies so that
NC3 systems operate together as a core set of survivable and endurable
capabilities that underpin a broader, national command and control
system. \[44\] In no small irony, the internet itself owes its
intellectual origin, in part, to the threat to NC3 from large-scale
physical attack. A 1962 RAND report by Paul Baran considered "the
problem of building digital communication networks using links with less
than perfect reliability" to enable "stations surviving a physical
attack and remaining in electrical connection ... to operate together as
a coherent entity after attack" \[45\]. Baran advocated as a solution
decentralized packet switching protocols, not unlike those realized in
the ARPANET program. The emergence of the internet was the result of
many other factors that had nothing to do with managing nuclear
operations, notably the meritocratic ideals of 1960s counterculture that
contributed to the neglect of security in the internet's founding
architecture \[46, 47\]. Fears of NC3 vulnerability helped to create the
internet, which then helped to create the present-day cybersecurity
epidemic, which has come full circle to create new fears about NC3
vulnerability. NC3 vulnerability is not unique to the United States. The
NC3 of other nuclear powers may even be easier to compromise, especially
in the case of new entrants to the nuclear club like North Korea.
Moreover, the United States has already demonstrated both the ability
and willingness to infiltrate sensitive foreign nuclear infrastructure
through operations such as Olympic Games (Stuxnet), albeit targeting
Iran's nuclear fuel cycle rather than NC3. It would be surprising to
learn that the United States has failed to upgrade its Cold War NC3
attack plans to include offensive cyber operations against a wide
variety of national targets. Hacking the deterrent The United States
included NC3 attacks in its Cold War counterforce and damage limitation
war plans, even as contemporary critics perceived these options to be
destabilizing for deterrence \[48\]. The best known example of these
activities and capabilities is a Special Access Program named Canopy
Wing. East German intelligence obtained the highly classified plans from
a US Army spy in Berlin, and the details began to emerge publicly after
the Cold War. An East German intelligence officer, Markus Wolf, writes
in his memoir that Canopy Wing "listed the types of electronic warfare
that would be used to neutralize the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact's
command centers in case of all-out war. It detailed the precise method
of depriving the Soviet High Command of its high-frequency
communications used to give orders to its armed forces" \[49\]. It is
easy to see why NC3 is such an attractive target in the unlikely event
of a nuclear war. [If for whatever reason deterrence fails and the enemy
decides to push the nuclear button, it would obviously be better to
disable or destroy missiles **before they launch**]{.underline} than to
rely on possibly futile efforts to shoot them down, or to accept the
loss of millions of lives. American plans to disable Soviet NC3 with
electronic warfare, furthermore, would have been intended to complement
plans for decapitating strikes against Soviet nuclear forces. Temporary
disabling of information networks in isolation would have failed to
achieve any important strategic objective. A blinded adversary would
eventually see again and would scramble to reconstitute its ability to
launch its weapons, expecting that preemption was inevitable in any
case. Reconstitution, moreover, would invalidate much of the
intelligence and some of the tradecraft on which the blinding attack
relied. Capabilities fielded through Canopy Wing were presumably
intended to facilitate a preemptive military strike on Soviet NC3 to
disable the ability to retaliate and limit the damage of any retaliatory
force that survived, given credible indications that war was imminent.
Canopy Wing included \[50\]: "Measures for short-circuiting ...
communications and weapons systems using, among other things,
microscopic carbon-fiber particles and chemical weapons." "Electronic
blocking of communications immediately prior to an attack, thereby
rendering a counterattack impossible." "Deployment of various weapons
systems for instantaneous destruction of command centers, including
pin-point targeting with precision-guided weapons to destroy 'hardened
bunkers'." "Use of deception measures, including the use of
computer-simulated voices to override and substitute false commands from
ground-control stations to aircraft and from regional command centers to
the Soviet submarine fleet." "Us\[e of\] the technical installations of
'Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty' and 'Voice of America,' as well as the
radio communications installations of the U.S. Armed Forces for creating
interference and other electronic effects." Wolf also ran a spy in the
US Air Force who disclosed that the Americans had managed to penetrate
the \[Soviet air base at Eberswalde\]'s ground-air communications and
were working on a method of blocking orders before they reached the
Russian pilots and substituting their own from West Berlin. Had this
succeeded, the MiG pilots would have received commands from their
American enemy. It sounded like science fiction, but, our experts
concluded, it was in no way impossible that they could have pulled off
such a trick, given the enormous spending and technical power of U.S.
military air research. \[49\] One East German source claimed that Canopy
Wing had a \$14.5 billion budget for research and operational costs and
a staff of 1570 people, while another claimed that it would take over 4
years and \$65 million to develop "a prototype of a sophisticated
electronic system for paralyzing Soviet radio traffic in the
high-frequency range" \[50\]. Canopy Wing was not cheap, and even so, it
was only a research and prototyping program. Operationalization of its
capabilities and integration into NATO war plans would have been even
more expensive. This is suggestive of the level of effort required to
craft effective offensive cyber operations against NC3. Preparation
comes to naught when a sensitive program is compromised. Canopy Wing was
caught in what we describe below as the cyber commitment problem, the
inability to disclose a warfighting capability for the sake of
deterrence without losing it in the process. According to New York Times
reporting on the counterintelligence investigation of the East German
spy in the Army, Warrant Officer James Hall, "officials said that one
program rendered useless cost hundreds of millions of dollars and was
designed to exploit a Soviet communications vulnerability uncovered in
the late 1970\'s" \[51\]. This program was probably Canopy Wing. Wolf
writes, "Once we passed \[Hall's documents about Canopy Wing\] on to the
Soviets, they were able to install scrambling devices and other
countermeasures" \[49\]. It is tempting to speculate that the Soviet
deployment of a new NC3 system known as Signal-A to replace Signal-M
(which was most likely the one targeted by Canopy Wing) was motivated in
part by Hall's betrayal \[50\]. Canopy Wing underscores the potential
and limitations of NC3 subversion. Modern cyber methods can potentially
perform many of the missions Canopy Wing addressed with electronic
warfare and other means, but with even greater stealth and precision.
Cyber operations might, in principle, compromise any part of the NC3
system (early warning, command centers, data transport, operational
forces, etc.) by blinding sensors, injecting bogus commands or
suppressing legitimate ones, monitoring or corrupting data
transmissions, or interfering with the reliable launch and guidance of
missiles. In practice, the operational feasibility of cyber attack
against NC3 or any other target depends on the software and hardware
configuration and organizational processes of the target, the
intelligence and planning capacity of the attacker, and the ability and
willingness to take advantage of the effects created by cyber attack
\[52, 53\]. Cyber compromise of NC3 is technically plausible though
operationally difficult, a point to which we return in a later section.
To understand which threats are not only technically possible but also
probable under some circumstance, we further need a political logic of
cost and benefit \[14\]. In particular, how is it possible for a crisis
to escalate to levels of destruction more costly than any conceivable
political reward? Canopy Wing highlights some of the strategic dangers
of NC3 exploitation. Warsaw Pact observers appear to have been deeply
concerned that the program reflected an American willingness to
undertake a surprise decapitation attack: they said that it "sent
ice-cold shivers down our spines" \[50\]. The Soviets designed a system
called Perimeter that, not unlike the Doomsday Device in Dr.
Strangelove, was designed to detect a nuclear attack and retaliate
automatically, even if cut off from Soviet high command, through an
elaborate system of sensors, underground computers, and command missiles
to transmit launch codes \[54\]. Both Canopy Wing and Perimeter show
that the United States and the Soviet Union took nuclear warfighting
seriously and were willing to develop secret advantages for such an
event. By the same token, they were not able to reveal such capabilities
to improve deterrence to avoid having to fight a nuclear war in the
first place. Nuclear deterrence and credible communication Nuclear
weapons have some salient political properties. They are singularly and
obviously destructive. They kill in more, and more ghastly, ways than
conventional munitions through electromagnetic radiation, blast,
firestorms, radioactive fallout, and health effects that linger for
years. Bombers, ICBMs, and SLBMs can project warheads globally without
significantly mitigating their lethality, steeply attenuating the
conventional loss-of-strength gradient \[55\]. Defense against nuclear
attack is very difficult, even with modern ballistic missile defenses,
given the speed of incoming warheads and use of decoys; multiple
warheads and missile volleys further reduce the probability of perfect
interception. If one cannot preemptively destroy all of an enemy's
missiles, then there is a nontrivial chance of getting hit by some of
them. When one missed missile can incinerate millions of people, the
notion of winning a nuclear war starts to seem meaningless for many
politicians. As defense seemed increasingly impractical, early Cold War
strategists championed the threat of assured retaliation as the chief
mechanism for avoiding war \[56--59\]. Political actors have issued
threats for millennia, but the advent of nuclear weapons brought
deterrence as a strategy to center stage. The Cold War was an intense
learning experience for both practitioners and students of international
security, rewriting well-worn realities more than once \[60--62\]. A key
conundrum was the practice of brinkmanship. Adversaries who could not
compete by "winning" a nuclear war could still compete by manipulating
the "risk" of nuclear annihilation, gambling that an opponent would have
the good judgment to back down at some point short of the nuclear brink.
Brinkmanship crises---conceptualized as games of Chicken where one
cannot heighten tensions without increasing the hazard of the mutually
undesired outcome---require that decision makers behave irrationally, or
possibly that they act randomly, which is difficult to conceptualize in
practical terms \[63\]. The chief concern in historical episodes of
chicken, such as the Berlin Crisis and Cuban Missile Crisis, was not
whether a certain level of harm was possible, but whether an adversary
was resolved enough, possibly, to risk nuclear suicide. The logical
inconsistency of the need for illogic to win led almost from the
beginning of the nuclear era to elaborate deductive contortions
\[64--66\]. Both mutually assured destruction (MAD) and successful
brinksmanship depend on a less appreciated, but no less fundamental,
feature of nuclear weapons: political transparency. Most elements of
military power are weakened by disclosure \[67\]. Military plans are
considerably less effective if shared with an enemy. Conventional
weapons become less lethal as adversaries learn what different systems
can and cannot do, where they are located, how they are operated, and
how to devise countermeasures and array defenses to blunt or disarm an
attack. In contrast, relatively little reduction in destruction follows
from enemy knowledge of nuclear capabilities. For most of the nuclear
era, no effective defense existed against a nuclear attack. Even today,
with evolving ABM systems, one ICBM still might get through and
annihilate the capital city. Nuclear forces are more robust to
revelation than other weapons, enabling nuclear nations better to
advertise the harm they can inflict. [The need for transparency to
achieve an effective deterrent is driven home by the satirical Cold War
film, Dr. Strangelove: "the whole point of a Doomsday Machine is lost,
if you keep it a secret! Why didn't you tell the world]{.underline},
eh?" [During the real Cold War]{.underline}, fortunately, [Soviet
leaders paraded their nuclear weapons through Red Square for the benefit
of foreign military attaches and the international press
corps]{.underline}. Satellites photographed missile, bomber, and
submarine bases. While other aspects of military affairs on both sides
of the Iron Curtain remained closely guarded secrets, the United States
and the Soviet Union permitted observers to evaluate their nuclear
capabilities. This is especially remarkable given the secrecy that
pervaded Soviet society. [The relative transparency of nuclear arsenals
ensured that the superpowers could calculate risks and
consequences]{.underline} within a first-order approximation, which led
to a reduction in severe conflict and instability even as political
competition in other arenas was fierce \[61, 68\]. Recent insights about
the causes of war suggest that **[divergent expectations]{.underline}**
[about the costs and consequences of war are **necessary for contests to
occur**]{.underline} \[69--73\]. These insights are associated with
rationalist theories, such as deterrence theory itself. [Empirical
studies and psychological critiques of the **rationality** assumption
have helped to **refine models** and bring some **circumspection** into
their application, but the formulation of **sound strategy** (if not the
**execution**) still requires the articulation of **some rational
linkage** between cause and effect]{.underline} \[19, 62, 74\]. [Many
supposedly **nonrational factors**, moreover, simply manifest as
**uncertainty** in strategic interaction.]{.underline} Our focus here is
on the effect of uncertainty and ignorance on the ability of states and
other actors to bargain in lieu of fighting. [Many wars are [a product
of]{.mark} what adversaries do not know or what they misperceive,
whether as a result of [**bluffing**, **secrecy**, or **intrinsic
uncertainty**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[75, 76\]. [If knowledge of
capabilities or resolve [is]{.mark} a prerequisite for deterrence, then
[one reason for **deterrence failure**]{.mark} is the inability or
unwillingness to **credibly communicate details of the genuine balance
of power**]{.underline}, threat, or interests. Fighting, conversely, can
be understood as a costly process of discovery that informs adversaries
of their actual relative strength and resolve. From this perspective,
successful deterrence involves instilling in an adversary perceptions
like those that result from fighting, but before fighting actually
begins. Agreement about the balance of power can enable states to
bargain (tacit or overt) effectively without needing to fight, forging
compromises that each prefers to military confrontation or even to the
bulk of possible risky brinkmanship crises. [Despite other deficits,
nuclear weapons have long been considered to be stabilizing with respect
to **rational incentives for war**]{.underline} (the risk of nuclear
accidents is another matter) \[77\]. [If each side has a secure second
strike]{.underline}---or even a minimal deterrent with some nonzero
chance of launching a few missiles---[then each side can expect to gain
little and lose much by fighting a nuclear war.]{.underline} Whereas the
costs of conventional war can be more mysterious because each side might
decide to hold something back and meter out its punishment due to some
internal constraint or a theory of graduated escalation, even a modest
initial nuclear exchange is recognized to be extremely costly. As long
as both sides understand this and understand (or believe) that the
adversary understands this as well, then the relationship is stable.
Countries engage nuclear powers with considerable deference, especially
over issues of fundamental national or international importance. At the
same time, nuclear weapons appear to be of limited value in prosecuting
aggressive action, especially over issues of secondary or tertiary
importance, or in response to aggression from others at lower levels of
dispute intensity. Nuclear weapons are best used for signaling a
willingness to run serious risks to protect or extort some issue that is
considered of vital national interest. As mentioned previously, both
superpowers in the Cold War considered the warfighting advantages of
nuclear weapons quite apart from any deterrent effect, and the United
States and Russia still do. High-altitude bursts for air defense,
electromagnetic pulse for frying electronics, underwater detonations for
anti-submarine warfare, hardened target penetration, area denial, and so
on, have some battlefield utility. Transparency per se is less important
than weapon effects for warfighting uses, and can even be deleterious
for tactics that depend on stealth and mobility. Even a single tactical
nuke, however, would inevitably be a political event. Survivability of
the second strike deterrent can also militate against transparency, as
in the case of the Soviet Perimeter system, as mobility, concealment,
and deception can make it harder for an observer to track and count
respective forces from space. Counterforce strategies, platform
diversity and mobility, ballistic missile defense systems, and force
employment doctrine can all make it more difficult for one or both sides
in a crisis to know whether an attack is likely to succeed or fail. The
resulting uncertainty affects not only estimates of relative
capabilities but also the degree of confidence in retaliation. At the
same time, there is reason to believe that platform diversity lowers the
risk of nuclear or conventional contests, because increasing the number
of types of delivery platforms heightens second strike survivability
without increasing the lethality of an initial strike \[78\]. While
transparency is not itself a requirement for nuclear use, stable
deterrence benefits to the degree to which retaliation can be
anticipated, as well as the likelihood that the consequences of a first
strike are more costly than any benefit. Cyber operations, in contrast,
are neither robust to revelation nor as obviously destructive. The cyber
commitment problem Deterrence (and compellence) uses force or threats of
force to "warn" an adversary about consequences if it takes or fails to
take an action. In contrast, defense (and conquest) uses force to "win"
a contest of strength and change the material distribution of power.
Sometimes militaries can change the distribution of information and
power at the same time. Military mobilization in a crisis signifies
resolve and displays a credible warning, but it also makes it easier to
attack or defend if the warning fails. Persistence in a battle of
attrition not only bleeds an adversary but also reveals a willingness to
pay a higher price for victory. More often, however, the informational
requirements of winning and warning are in tension. Combat performance
often hinges on well-kept secrets, feints, and diversions. Many military
plans and capabilities degrade when revealed. National security involves
trade-offs between the goals of preventing war, by advertising
capabilities or interests, and improving fighting power should war break
out, by concealing capabilities and surprising the enemy. The need to
conceal details of the true balance of power to preserve battlefield
effectiveness gives rise to the military commitment problem \[79, 80\].
Japan could not coerce the United States by revealing its plan to attack
Pearl Harbor because the United States could not credibly promise to
refrain from reorienting defenses and dispersing the Pacific Fleet. War
resulted not just because of what opponents did not know but because of
what they could not tell each other without paying a severe price in
military advantage. The military benefits of surprise (winning) trumped
the diplomatic benefits of coercion (warning). Cyber operations, whether
for disruption and intelligence, are extremely constrained by the
military commitment problem. Revelation of a cyber threat in advance
that is specific enough to convince a target of the validity of the
threat also provides enough information potentially to neutralize it.
Stuxnet took years and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop but
was patched within weeks of its discovery. The Snowden leaks negated a
whole swath of tradecraft that the NSA took years to develop. States may
use other forms of covert action, such as publicly disavowed lethal aid
or aerial bombing (e.g. Nixon's Cambodia campaign), to discretely signal
their interests, but such cases can only work to the extent that
revelation of operational details fails to disarm rebels or prevent
airstrikes \[81\]. Cyber operations, especially against NC3, must be
conducted in extreme secrecy as a condition of the efficacy of the
attack. Cyber tradecraft relies on stealth, stratagem, and deception
\[21\]. Operations tailored to compromise complex remote targets require
extensive intelligence, planning and preparation, and testing to be
effective. Actions that alert a target of an exploit allow the target to
patch, reconfigure, or adopt countermeasures that invalidate the plan.
As the Defense Science Board points out, competent network defenders:
can also be expected to employ highly-trained system and network
administrators, and this operational staff will be equipped with
continuously improving network defensive tools and techniques (the same
tools we advocate to improve our defenses). Should an adversary discover
an implant, it is usually relatively simple to remove or disable. For
this reason, offensive cyber will always be a fragile capability. \[41\]
The world's most advanced cyber powers, the United States, Russia,
Israel, China, France, and the United Kingdom, are also nuclear states,
while India, Pakistan, and North Korea also have cyber warfare programs.
NC3 is likely to be an especially well defended part of their cyber
infrastructures. NC3 is a hard target for offensive operations, which
thus requires careful planning, detailed intelligence, and long
lead-times to avoid compromise. Cyberspace is further ill-suited for
signaling because cyber operations are complex, esoteric, and hard for
commanders and policymakers to understand. Most targeted cyber
operations have to be tailored for each unique target (a complex
organization not simply a machine), quite unlike a general purpose
munition tested on a range. Malware can fail in many ways and produce
unintended side effects, as when the Stuxnet code was accidentally
released to the public. The category of "cyber" includes tremendous
diversity: irritant scams, hacktivist and propaganda operations,
intelligence collection, critical infrastructure disruption, etc. Few
intrusions create consequences that rise to the level of attacks such as
Stuxnet or BlackEnergy, and even they pale beside the harm imposed by a
small war. Vague threats are less credible because they are
indistinguishable from casual bluffing. Ambiguity can be useful for
concealing a lack of capability or resolve, allowing an actor to pool
with more capable or resolved states and acquiring some deterrence
success by association. But this works by discounting the costliness of
the threat. Nuclear threats, for example, are usually somewhat veiled
because one cannot credibly threaten nuclear suicide. The consistently
ambiguous phrasing of US cyber declaratory policy (e.g. "we will respond
to cyber-attacks in a manner and at a time and place of our choosing
using appropriate instruments of U.S. power" \[82\]) seeks to operate
across domains to mobilize credibility in one area to compensate for a
lack of credibility elsewhere, specifically by leveraging the greater
robustness to revelation of military capabilities other than cyber. This
does not mean that cyberspace is categorically useless for signaling,
just as nuclear weapons are not categorically useless for warfighting.
Ransomware attacks work when the money extorted to unlock the
compromised host is priced below the cost of an investigation or
replacing the system. The United States probably gained some benefits in
general deterrence (i.e. discouraging the emergence of challenges as
opposed to immediate deterrence in response to a challenge) through the
disclosure of Stuxnet and the Snowden leaks. Both revelations
compromised tradecraft, but they also advertised that the NSA probably
had more exploits and tradecraft where they came from. Some cyber
operations may actually be hard to mitigate within tactically meaningful
timelines (e.g. hardware implants installed in hard-to-reach locations).
Such operations might be revealed to coerce concessions within the
tactical window created by a given operation, if the attacker can
coordinate the window with the application of coercion in other domains.
As a general rule, however, the cyber domain on its own is better suited
for winning than warning \[83\]. Cyber and nuclear weapons fall on
extreme opposite sides of this spectrum. Dangerous complements Nuclear
weapons have been used in anger twice---against the Japanese cities
Hiroshima and Nagasaki---but cyberspace is abused daily. Considered
separately, the nuclear domain is stable and the cyber domain is
unstable. In combination, the results are ambiguous. The nuclear domain
can bound the intensity of destruction that a cyber attacker is willing
to inflict on an adversary. US declaratory policy states that
unacceptable cyber attacks may prompt a military response; while nuclear
weapons are not explicitly threatened, neither are they withheld.
Nuclear threats have no credibility at the low end, where the bulk of
cyber attacks occur. This produces a cross-domain version of the
stability--instability paradox, where deterrence works at the high end
but is not credible, and thus encourages provocation, at low
intensities. Nuclear weapons, and military power generally, create an
upper bound on cyber aggression to the degree that retaliation is
anticipated and feared \[22, 83, 84\]. In the other direction, the
unstable cyber domain can undermine the stability of nuclear deterrence.
Most analysts who argue that the cyber--nuclear combination is a recipe
for danger focus on the fog of crisis decision making \[85--87\].
Stephen Cimbala points out that today's relatively smaller nuclear
arsenals may perversely magnify the attractiveness of NC3 exploitation
in a crisis: "Ironically, the downsizing of U.S. and post-Soviet Russian
strategic nuclear arsenals since the end of the Cold War, while a
positive development from the perspectives of nuclear arms control and
nonproliferation, makes the concurrence of cyber and nuclear attack
capabilities more alarming" \[88\]. Cimbala focuses mainly on the [risks
of **misperception** and **miscalculation**]{.underline} that [emerge
when a cyber attack muddies the **transparent
communication**]{.underline} [required for opponents to understand one
another's interests, redlines, and willingness to use force, and to
ensure reliable control over subordinate commanders. Thus a nuclear
actor "faced with a sudden burst of **holes**]{.underline} [in its vital
warning and response systems might, for example, press the **preemption
button** instead of **waiting to ride out the attack and then
retaliate**]{.underline}" \[85\]. [The outcome of fog of decision
scenarios such as these depend on how humans react to risk and
uncertainty]{.underline}, which in turn depends on bounded rationality
and organizational frameworks that might confuse rational decision
making \[89, 90\]. These factors exacerbate a hard problem. Yet within a
rationalist framework, cyber attacks that have already created their
effects need not trigger an escalatory spiral. While being handed a fait
accompli may trigger an aggressive reaction, it is also plausible that
the target's awareness that its NC3 has been compromised in some way
would help to convey new information that the balance of power is not as
favorable as previously thought. This in turn could encourage the target
to accommodate, rather than escalate. While defects in rational decision
making are a serious concern in any cyber--nuclear scenario, the
situation becomes even more hazardous when there are rational incentives
to escalate. Although "known unknowns" can create confusion, to
paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld, the "unknown unknowns" are perhaps more
dangerous. [A successful clandestine penetration of NC3 can **defeat the
informational symmetry that stabilizes nuclear
relationships**.]{.underline} [Nuclear weapons are useful for deterrence
because they impose a degree of **consensus** about the distribution of
power; each side knows the other can inflict prohibitive levels of
damage, even if they may disagree about the precise extent of this
damage. Cyber operations are attractive **precisely because they can
secretly revise the distribution of power**]{.underline}. [NC3
neutralization]{.underline} may be an expensive and rarified capability
in the reach of only a few states with mature signals intelligence
agencies, but it [is much cheaper than nuclear attack]{.underline}. Yet
the very usefulness of cyber operations for nuclear warfighting ensure
that deterrence failure during brinksmanship crises is more likely.
[Nuclear states may initiate crises of risk and resolve]{.underline} to
see who will back down first, which is not always clear in advance.
Chicken appears viable, ironically, be[cause each player understands
that a nuclear war would be a disaster for all, and thus all can agree
that someone can be expected swerve.]{.underline} Nuclear deterrence
should ultimately make dealing with an adversary diplomatically more
attractive than fighting, provided that fighting is costly---as would
seem evident for the prospect of nuclear war---and assuming that
bargains are available to states willing to accept compromise rather
than annihilation. [If, however, one side knows, but the other does not,
that the attacker has disabled the target's ability to perceive an
impending military attack, or to react to one]{.underline} when it is
underway, then [they will not have a shared understanding of the
probable outcome of war, even in broad terms.]{.underline} Consider a
brinksmanship crisis between two nuclear states where only one has
realized a successful penetration of the rival's NC3. The cyber attacker
knows that it has a military advantage, but it cannot reveal the
advantage to the target, lest the advantage be lost. The target does not
know that it is at a disadvantage, and it cannot be told by the attacker
for the same reason. The attacker perceives an imbalance of power while
the target perceives a balance. A dangerous competition in risk taking
ensues. The first side knows that it does not need to back down. The
second side feels confident that it can stand fast and raise the stakes
far beyond what it would be willing to if it understood the true balance
of power. Each side is willing to escalate to create more risk for the
other side, making it more likely that one or the other will conclude
that deterrence has failed and move into warfighting mode to attempt to
limit the damage the other can inflict. The targeted nature and
uncertain effects of offensive cyber operations put additional pressure
on decision makers. An intrusion will probably disable only part of the
enemy's NC3 architecture, not all of it (which is not only operationally
formidable to achieve but also more likely to be noticed by the target).
Thus the target may retain control over some nuclear forces, or
conventional forces. The target may be tempted to use some of them
piecemeal to signal a willingness to escalate further, even though it
cannot actually escalate because of the cyber operation. The cyber
attacker knows that it has escalation dominance, but when even a minor
demonstration by the target can cause great damage, it is tempting to
preempt this move or others like it. This situation would be especially
unstable if only second strike but not primary strike NC3 was
incapacitated. Uncertainty in the efficacy of the clandestine
penetration would discount the attacker's confidence in its escalation
dominance, with a range of possible outcomes. Enough uncertainty would
discount the cyber attack to nothing, which would have a stabilizing
effect by returning the crisis to the pure nuclear domain. A little bit
of uncertainty about cyber effectiveness would heighten risk acceptance
while also raising the incentives to preempt as an insurance measure.
[[Adding]{.underline} **[allies]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in[to the mix
**introduce**s **additional** instability]{.mark}]{.underline}. An ally
emboldened by its nuclear umbrella might run provocative risks that it
would be much more reluctant to embrace if it was aware that the
umbrella was actually full of holes. Conversely, if the clandestine
advantage is held by the state extending the umbrella, allies could
become unnerved by the willingness of their defender to run what appear
to be outsize risks, oblivious of the reasons for the defender's
confidence, creating discord in the alliance and incentives for
self-protective action, leading to greater uncertainty about alliance
solidarity. The direction of influence between the cyber and nuclear
realms depends to large degree on which domain is the main arena of
action. Planning and conducting cyber operations will be bounded by the
ability of aggressors to convince themselves that attacks will remain
secret, and by the confidence of nuclear nations in their
invulnerability. Fears of cross-domain escalation will tend to keep
instability in cyberspace bounded. However, if a crisis has risen to the
point where nuclear threats are being seriously considered or made, then
NC3 exploitation will be destabilizing. Brinksmanship crises seem to
have receded in frequency since the Cuban Missile Crisis but may be more
likely than is generally believed. President Vladimir Putin of Russia
has insinuated more than once in recent years that his government is
willing to use tactical nuclear weapons if necessary to support his
policies. Cyber power and nuclear stability Not all crises are the same.
Indeed, their very idiosyncrasies create the uncertainties that make
bargaining failure more likely \[75\]. So far our analysis would be at
home in the Cold War, with the technological novelty of cyber
operations. Yet not every state has the same cyber capabilities or
vulnerabilities. Variation in cyber power relations across dyads should
be expected to affect the strategic stability of nuclear states. The
so-called second nuclear age differs from superpower rivalry in
important ways \[91\]. There are fewer absolute numbers of warheads in
the world, down from a peak of over 70 000 in the 1980s to about 15 000
today (less than 5000 deployed), but they are distributed very unevenly
\[92\]. The United States and Russia have comparably sized arsenals,
each with a fully diversified triad of delivery platforms, while North
Korea only has a dozen or so bombs and no meaningful delivery system
(for now). China, India, Pakistan, Britain, France, and Israel have
modest arsenals in the range of several dozen to a couple hundred
weapons, but they have very different doctrines, conventional force
complements, domestic political institutions, and alliance
relationships. The recent nuclear powers lack the hard-won experience
and shared norms of the Cold War to guide them through crises, and even
the United States and Russia have much to relearn. Cyber warfare
capacity also varies considerably across contemporary nuclear nations.
The United States, Russia, Israel, and Britain are in the top tier, able
to run sophisticated, persistent, clandestine penetrations. China is a
uniquely active cyber power with ambitious cyber warfare doctrine, but
its operational focus is on economic espionage and political censorship,
resulting in less refined tradecraft and more porous defenses for
military purposes \[16\]. France, India, and Pakistan also have active
cyber warfare programs, while North Korea is the least developed cyber
nation, depending on China for its expertise \[93\]. It is beyond the
scope of this article to assess crisis dyads in detail, and data on
nuclear and cyber power for these countries are shrouded in secrecy.
Here, as a way of summing up the arguments above, we offer a few
conjectures about how stylized aspects of cyber power affect crisis
stability through incentives and key aspects of decision making. We do
not stress relative nuclear weapon capabilities on the admittedly strong
(and contestable) assumption that nuclear transparency in the absence of
cyber operations would render nuclear asymmetry irrelevant for crisis
bargaining because both sides would agree about the terrible
consequences of conflict \[94\]. We also omit domestic or psychological
variables that affect relative power assessments, although these are
obviously important. Even if neither India nor Pakistan have viable
cyber--nuclear capabilities, brinksmanship between them is dangerous for
many other reasons, notably compressed decision timelines, Pakistan's
willingness to shoot first, and domestic regime instability. Our focus
is on the impact of offensive and defensive cyber power on nuclear
deterrence above and beyond the other factors that certainly play a role
in real-world outcomes. First, does the cyber attacker have the
organizational capacity, technical expertise, and intelligence support
to "compromise" the target's NC3? Can hackers access critical networks,
exploit technical vulnerabilities, and confidently execute a payload to
disrupt or exploit strategic sensing, command, forces, or transport
capacity? The result would be some tangible advantage for warfighting,
such as tactical warning or control paralysis, but one that cannot be
exercised in bargaining. Second, is the target able to "detect" the
compromise of its NC3? The more complicated and sensitive the target,
the more likely cyber attackers are to make a mistake that undermines
the intrusion. Attribution is not likely to be difficult given the
constricted pool of potential attackers, but at the same time the
consequences of misattributing "false flag" operations could be severe
\[95\]. At a minimum, detection is assumed to provide information to the
target that the balance of power is perhaps not as favorable as imagined
previously. We assume that detection without an actual compromise is
possible because of false positives or deceptive information operations
designed to create pessimism or paranoia. Third, is the target able to
"mitigate" the compromise it detects? Revelation can prompt patching or
network reconfiguration to block an attack, but this assumption is not
always realistic. The attacker may have multiple pathways open or may
have implanted malware that is difficult to remove in tactically
meaningful timelines. In such cases the cyber commitment problem is not
absolute, since the discovery of the power to hurt does not
automatically disarm it. Successful mitigation here is assumed to
restore mutual assessments of the balance of power to what they would be
absent the cyber attack. Table 1 shows how these factors combine to
produce different deterrence outcomes in a brinksmanship (chicken)
crisis. If there is no cyber compromise and the target detects nothing
(no false positives) then we have the optimistic ideal case where
nuclear transparency affords stable "deterrence." Transparency about the
nuclear balance, including the viability of secure second strike forces,
provides strategic stability. We also expect this box to describe
situations where the target has excellent network defense capabilities
and thus the prospect of defense, denial or deception successfully
deters any attempts to penetrate NC3. This may resemble the Cold War
situation (with electronic warfare in lieu of cyber), or even the
present day US--Russia dyad, where the odds of either side pulling off a
successful compromise against a highly capable defender are not
favorable. Alternately the attack may be deemed risky enough to
encourage serious circumspection. However, the existence of Canopy Wing
does not encourage optimism in this regard. \[\[TABLE 1 OMITTED\]\]
Conversely, if there is a compromise that goes undetected, then there is
a heightened risk of "war" because of the cyber commitment problem. This
box may be particularly relevant for asymmetric dyads such as the United
States and North Korea, where one side has real cyber power but the
other side is willing to go to the brink where it believes, falsely,
that it has the capability to compel its counterpart to back down. Cyber
disruption of NC3 is attractive for damage limitation should deterrence
fail, given that the weaker state's diminutive arsenal makes damage
limitation by the stronger state more likely to succeed. The dilemma for
the stronger state is that the clandestine counterforce hedge, which
makes warfighting success more likely, is precisely what makes
deterrence more likely to fail. The United States would face similar
counterforce dilemmas with other dyads like China or even Russia,
although even a strong cyber power should be more circumspect when
confronted with an adversary with a larger/more capable nuclear and
conventional arsenal. More complex and cyber savvy targets, moreover,
are more likely to detect a breach in NC3, leading to more ambiguous
outcomes depending on how actors cope with risk and uncertainty.
Paradoxically, confidence in cyber security may be a major contributor
to failure; believing one is safe from attack increases the chance that
an attack is successful. If the successful compromise is detected but
not mitigated, then the target learns that the balance of power is not
as favorable as thought. This possibility suggests fleeting
opportunities for "coercion" by revealing the cyber coup to the target
in the midst of a crisis while the cyber attacker maintains or develops
a favorable military advantage before the target has the opportunity to
reverse or compensate the NC3 disruption. Recognizing the newly
transparent costs of war, a risk neutral or risk averse target should
prefer compromise. The coercive advantages (deterrence or compellence)
of a detected but unmitigated NC3 compromise will likely be fleeting.
This suggests a logical possibility for creating a window of opportunity
for using particular cyber operations that are more robust to revelation
as a credible signal of superior capability in the midst of a crisis. It
would be important to exploit this fleeting advantage via other credible
military threats (e.g. forces mobilized on visible alert or deployed
into the crisis area) before the window closes. One side may be able
gain an unearned advantage, an opportunity for coercion via a "bluff,"
by the same window-of-opportunity logic. A target concerned about NC3
compromise will probably have some network monitoring system and other
protections in place. Defensive systems can produce false positives as a
result of internal errors or a deception operation by the attacker to
encourage paranoia. It is logically possible that some false positives
would appear to the target to be difficult to mitigate. In this
situation, the target could believe it is at a disadvantage, even though
this is not in fact the case. This gambit would be operationally very
difficult to pull off with any reliability in a real nuclear crisis.
Cyber--nuclear coercion and bluffing strategies are fraught with danger.
Detection without mitigation might put a risk-acceptant or loss-averse
target into a "use-lose" situation, creating pressures to preempt or
escalate. The muddling of decision-making heightens the risk of
accidents or irrational choices in a crisis scenario. Worry about
preemption or accident then heightens the likelihood that the initiator
will exercise counterforce options while they remain available. These
pressures can be expected to be particularly intense if the target's
detection is only partial or has not revealed the true extent of damage
to its NC3 (i.e. the target does not realize it has already lost some or
all of what it hopes to use). These types of scenarios are most usually
invoked in analyses of inadvertent escalation \[23--27\]. The essential
distinction between "use-lose" risks and "war" in this typology is the
target's knowledge of some degree of NC3 compromise. Use-lose and other
cognitive pressures can certainly result in nuclear war, since the
breakdown of deterrence leads to the release of nuclear weapons, but we
distinguish these outcomes to highlight the different decision making
processes or rational incentives at work. A "spiral" of mistrust may
emerge if one side attempts a compromise but the defender detects and
mitigates it. Both sides again have common mutual estimates of the
relative balance of power, which superficially resembles the
"deterrence" case because the NC3 compromise is negated. Unfortunately,
the detection of the compromise will provide the target with information
about the hostile intentions of the cyber attacker. This in turn is
likely to exacerbate other political or psychological factors in the
crisis itself or in the crisis-proneness of the broader relationship.
The strange logical case where there is no compromise but one is
detected and mitigated could result from a false positive misperception
(including a third-party false flag operation) that could conflict
spiraling \[96, 97\]. The bluff and coercion outcomes are also likely to
encourage spiraling behavior once the fleeting bargaining advantage
dissipates or is dispelled (provided anyone survives the interaction).
The risk of crisis instability is not the same for all dyads. It is
harder to compromise the NC3 of strong states because of the redundancy
and active defenses in their arsenal. Likewise, strong states are better
able to compromise the NC3 of any states but especially of weaker
states, because of strong states' greater organizational capacity and
expertise in cyber operations. Stable deterrence or MAD is most likely
to hold in mutually strong dyads (e.g. [the United States
and]{.underline} the Soviet Union in the Cold War or
**[Russia]{.underline}** today to a lesser extent). Deterrence is
slightly less likely in other equally matched dyads
(**[India--Pakistan]{.underline}**) where defensive vulnerabilities
create temptations but offensive capabilities may not be sufficient to
exploit them. Most states can be expected to refrain from targeting
American NC3 given a US reputation for cyber power (a general deterrence
benefit enhanced by Stuxnet and Snowden). The situation is less stable
if the United States is the attacker. The most dangerous dyad is a
stronger and a weaker state (United States and **[North
Korea]{.underline}** or **[Israel]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Iran]{.underline}**). [Dyads involving strong and middle powers
are]{.underline} also **[dangerous]{.underline}** ([United States and
**China**]{.underline}**).** [The stronger side is tempted to disrupt
NC3 as a warfighting hedge in case deterrence breaks down, while the
weaker but still formidable side has a reasonable chance at detection.
The marginally weaker may also be tempted to subvert NC3, particularly
for reconnaissance; the stronger side is more likely to detect and
correct the intrusion but will be alarmed by]{.underline} the
[ambiguity]{.underline} in distinguishing intelligence collection from
attack planning \[98\]. [In [a **brinksmanship

A [[NATO military response to]{.underline}]{.mark} the postulated
[[Russian aggression seems]{.mark} very [likely.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Perhaps evidence of its preparations to move forces into position to
defend its ally and liberate its territory from Russian occupation would
be enough to catalyze a diplomatic resolution of the crisis. If not,
however, the [[stage would be set for]{.mark} the possible eruption of
[**World War III**. Russia might]{.mark}]{.underline} try to [[impede a
deployment through **cyber**]{.mark}-, **space**, and **other such
[attacks]{.mark}**[, which would]{.mark} likely only [slow]{.mark} the
[deployment]{.mark}]{.underline}, not stop it. [[Thus **escalation could
easily result**.]{.underline}]{.mark} 62 [[Once shots were fired, **NATO
would be unlikely to back down**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Not every nation
would necessarily send significant military forces, to be sure, but some
key countries would probably remain resolute. [Much more likely than
acceptance of defeat would be a **redoubled commitment** to **complete
the mission**---and, **if Russian nuclear weapons had been used** by
that point, **even in a limited attack**, to **respond in
kind**.]{.underline} Put differently, if Russia did choose to try to
physically prevent the deployment of large forces into eastern NATO
territory in likely preparation for a counterattack, there would be two
possibilities. If that attempt failed, a showdown in the east on land
would still loom. If it succeeded, NATO would then face a momentous
decision: accept defeat, or reinforce dramatically with conventional
forces (perhaps after a period of repairing damage and building more
equipment and weaponry, depending on how many losses it had already
suffered), or escalate to the nuclear level. In situations of this sort,
the parties to the conflict might find themselves living scenarios like
those that nuclear theorists pondered throughout the Cold War. [[They
could be engaged in]{.underline}]{.mark} behavior that Thomas Schelling
might have described as "the threat that leaves something to chance" or
that Herman Kahn might have placed on the lower rungs of [[a **nuclear
escalation ladder** that **reached**]{.mark} **potentially [to all-out
war]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} 63 American planners saw these
kinds of escalatory ladders and options as ideas that might serve U.S.
interests; thus it would not be too surprising to see Russian planners
invoke them now. 64 And [whatever the [dangers during]{.mark} the
[deployment]{.mark} phase, they [would **snowball**]{.mark} during any
actual maneuver warfare in eastern Europe.]{.underline} For example, it
is entirely imaginable that an operation designed to liberate a Baltic
state from a Russian occupation would trespass onto Russian territory to
cut off supply lines and possible reinforcements. 65 Moscow may or may
not simply take NATO's word that it has no designs on the country's
government. In other words, [it might even fear that NATO's
counteroffensive could aspire to regime change in Russia.]{.underline}
It may or may not have a clear picture of the kind of attack it is
experiencing, as **[[command and control systems would be
compromised]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the course of conventional battle,
quite possibly [[including those]{.mark} systems commonly [used for
**nuclear weapons**.]{.mark}]{.underline} 66

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, [even [in a]{.mark}n
all-out [nuclear war between]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite horrific casualties, [neither
country's population is likely to be completely destroyed **by the
direct effects of the blast**]{.underline}, fire, and radiation.8 [The
[aftermath could]{.mark} be **much worse**]{.underline}: the
[burning]{.underline} of [flammable materials could [send
massive]{.mark} amounts of [smoke into the
atmosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}, which would absorb sunlight and cause
sustained global cooling, severe ozone loss, and agricultural disruption
-- **[[a nuclear winter]{.underline}]{.mark}**. According to one model 9
, [an all-out exchange of 4,000 weapons]{.underline}10 [[could]{.mark}
lead to a [drop]{.mark} in [global temperatures]{.mark} of around 8°C,
[making it **impossible to grow food**]{.mark} **for**]{.underline} 4 to
[**5 years**. This could leave some survivors]{.underline} in parts of
Australia and New Zealand, [but they would be in a very precarious
situation and the **[threat of extinction]{.mark} from other sources
[would be great]{.mark}**. An exchange on this scale is **[only possible
between the US and Russia]{.mark}** who have more than 90% of the
world's nuclear weapons]{.underline}, with stockpiles of around 4,500
warheads each, although many are not operationally deployed.11 Some
models suggest that even [[a small]{.mark} regional nuclear [war]{.mark}
involving 100 nuclear weapons would]{.underline} produce a nuclear
winter serious enough to [put two billion]{.underline} people [at
risk]{.underline} of starvation,12 [though this]{.underline} estimate
**[might be pessimistic]{.underline}**.13 [Wars on this scale [are
**unlikely to lead to**]{.mark}]{.underline} outright **[human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but this does suggest that conflicts
which are around an order of magnitude larger may be likely to threaten
civilisation. It should be emphasised that there is very large
uncertainty about the effects of a large nuclear war on global climate.
This remains an area where increased academic research work, including
more detailed climate modelling and a better understanding of how
survivors might be able to cope and adapt, would have high returns. [It
is]{.underline} very [difficult to precisely estimate [the]{.mark}
probability of **existential [risk]{.mark} from nuclear
war**]{.underline} over the next century, and existing attempts leave
very large confidence intervals. According to many experts, [the most
likely nuclear war]{.underline} at present [is between India and
Pakistan]{.underline}.14 [However, given the relatively modest size of
their arsenals, the risk of human extinction [is]{.mark} **plausibly
[greater]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} a conflict between the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Tensions between these countries have
increased in recent years and it seems unreasonable to rule out the
possibility of them rising further in the future.

If any initial conventional engagements went against its interests,
[[Russia]{.mark} might]{.underline} also [consider **limited nuclear
employment** options.]{.underline} Indeed, some of [its
**[strategists]{.mark}** currently [entertain]{.mark} an ["**escalate to
de-escalate**"]{.mark} concept [that would attempt to **intimidate NATO
allies**]{.mark}]{.underline} into reversing their plans. [Russia might
detonate a nuclear weapon high in the atmosphere to create
a]{.underline} powerful nuclear-induced electromagnetic pulse [(**EMP**)
that could prove **lethal** to air defense radars, **military
communications systems**, and much civilian infrastructure over a
region]{.underline} many hundreds of kilometers in radius. A Russian EMP
burst using a high-altitude nuclear weapon would be an extremely
provocative and risky move, to be sure. 57 But some [Russian leaders
could argue]{.underline} that [it was not strictly speaking a nuclear
attack, since no humans would be killed by the direct explosive effects
of such a weapon---and]{.underline} thus might [delude themselves
into]{.underline} thinking [it was a relatively low-risk
option.]{.underline} In fact, the risks could be very high. Some types
of [EMP attacks (or even [cyberattacks) by Russia
could]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~disable~~ [[\[**shut down**\] large chunks
of]{.mark} the [**U.S. or European electricity grids** for]{.mark}
**many [months]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}58 A severe [attack of
[this]{.mark} type [might]{.mark}]{.underline} even [[**lead to a U.S.
nuclear response**, in light of]{.mark} the [**new nuclear doctrine**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration.
59 Beyond the EMP option, Russia could use nuclear weapons directly
against ships that carried military equipment, missile defense radars,
or other capabilities. Indeed, it threatened to target nuclear missiles
at any Danish ships joining the U.S.-led missile defense effort in 2015.
Again, the provocation would be enormous--- but the direct human stakes
might be fairly limited, since only dozens of sailors, or at most a
couple hundred, might be on a given naval vessel. 60 [Moscow
might]{.underline}, perhaps delusionally, [think the risks were
acceptable.]{.underline} Of course, there would be enormous significance
and risk to crossing the nuclear threshold in any way. But if weapons
were used against isolated military targets (as both sides contemplated
in various ways during the Cold War), [[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}
again [[might convince itself]{.underline},]{.mark} rightly or wrongly,
[that [escalation risks could be]{.mark} tolerated and
[managed.]{.mark}]{.underline} That might be particularly true for
attacks limited to the kinds of target sets that posed disproportionate
vulnerability and dependence for NATO. These could include cargo ships
at sea, rail marshaling yards where train tracks change gauge
(necessitating unloading and reloading) at the Poland- Lithuania border,
or particularly weak bridges without nearby alternative routes. 61 If
Russia could limit NATO fatalities to hundreds of sailors and not itself
present any target sets that were characterized by a similar combination
of relatively high military importance and relatively great separation
from vulnerable civilian populations, NATO might not have a good
recourse. [Moscow might hope as much, at least---[and]{.mark} so **elect
to [roll the dice]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Such a decision would
be reckless and foolish, but perhaps not beyond the pale of how human
beings have behaved historically in wars they felt they were otherwise
likely to lose.

Crops]{.mark} and livestock [require water delivered by]{.mark}

is only 6% more than in 1900, yet productivity has increased 50 fold
\[69\]. As stated by Dr. Lowell L Wood in Congressional testimony: "If
we were no longer able to fuel our agricultural machine in the country,
the [food production]{.underline} of the country [would simply
stop]{.underline}, because we do not have the horses and mules that used
to tow agricultural gear around in the 1880s and 1890s". "So the
situation would be exceedingly adverse if both electricity and the fuel

#### Cyberwar causes nuclear war and draw-in even if NATO-Russia war does not\-\--[independently]{.underline} crushes nuclear [deterrence]{.underline}

For the past several years, the U.S. Department of Defense has been
exploring how it could employ its own very robust cyberattack
capabilities to compromise or destroy enemy missiles from such states as
North Korea before they can be fired, a strategy sometimes called "left
of launch."3 Russia and China can assume, on this basis, that their own
launch facilities are being probed for such vulnerabilities, presumably
leading them to adopt escalatory policies such as those espoused in the
2018 NPR report. Wherever one looks, therefore, [the [links between
cyberwar and nuclear war are growing]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Nuclear-Cyber Connection These links exist because the [[NC3
systems]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the United States
and other [[nuclear-armed states are heavily dependent
on]{.underline}]{.mark} computers and other digital
[[processors]{.underline}]{.mark} [for]{.underline} virtually [every
aspect of]{.underline} their [operation [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
because those systems [are [**highly vulnerable to
cyberattack**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Every nuclear force is composed,
most basically, of weapons, early-warning radars, launch facilities, and
the top officials, usually presidents or prime ministers, empowered to
initiate a nuclear exchange. Connecting them all, however, is an
extended network of communications and data-processing systems, all
reliant on cyberspace. Warning systems, ground- and space-based, must
constantly watch for and analyze possible enemy missile launches. Data
on actual threats must rapidly be communicated to decision-makers, who
must then weigh possible responses and communicate chosen outcomes to
launch facilities, which in turn must provide attack vectors to delivery
systems. All of this involves operations in cyberspace, and it is in
this domain that great power rivals seek vulnerabilities to exploit in a
constant struggle for advantage. The use of cyberspace to gain an
advantage over adversaries takes many forms and is not always aimed at
nuclear systems. China has been accused of engaging in widespread
cyberespionage to steal technical secrets from U.S. firms for economic
and military advantages. Russia has been accused, most extensively in
the Robert Mueller report, of exploiting cyberspace to interfere in the
2016 U.S. presidential election. Nonstate actors, including terrorist
groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State group, have used the
internet for recruiting combatants and spreading fear. Criminal groups,
including some thought to be allied with state actors, such as North
Korea, have used cyberspace to extort money from banks, municipalities,
and individuals.4 Attacks such as these occupy most of the time and
attention of civilian and military cybersecurity organizations that
attempt to thwart such attacks. Yet for those who worry about strategic
stability and the risks of nuclear escalation, it is the threat of
cyberattacks on NC3 systems that provokes the greatest concern. Gen.

Services Committee hearing on February 14. He warned that China and
Russia are conducting sustained cybercampaigns against the United
States. (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)This concern stems from the
fact that, despite the immense effort devoted to protecting NC3 systems
from cyberattack, no enterprise that relies so extensively on computers
and cyberspace can be made 100 percent invulnerable to attack. This is
so because such systems employ many devices and operating systems of
various origins and vintages, most incorporating numerous software
updates and "patches" over time, offering multiple vectors for attack.
Electronic components can also be modified by hostile actors during
production, transit, or insertion; and the whole system itself is
dependent to a considerable degree on the electrical grid, which itself
is vulnerable to cyberattack and is far less protected. Experienced
"cyberwarriors" of every major power have been working for years to
probe for weaknesses in these systems and in many cases have devised
cyberweapons, typically, malicious software (malware) and computer
viruses, to exploit those weaknesses for military advantage.5 Although
activity in cyberspace is much more difficult to detect and track than
conventional military operations, enough information has become public
to indicate that the major nuclear powers, notably [[**China**,
**Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, along
with such secondary powers as [[**Iran** and
**No**]{.underline}]{.mark}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea,
[[have]{.mark} established]{.underline} extensive cyberwarfare
capabilities and engage in **[[o]{.mark}ffensive
[c]{.mark}yber[o]{.mark}peration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** on a regular
basis, often [[aimed at **critical**]{.mark} **military
[infrastructure]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} "Cyberspace is a
contested environment where we are in constant contact with
adversaries," General Paul M. Nakasone, commander of the U.S. Cyber
Command (Cybercom), told the Senate Armed Services Committee in February
2019. "We see near-peer competitors \[China and Russia\] conducting
sustained campaigns below the level of armed conflict to erode American
strength and gain strategic advantage." Although eager to speak of
adversary threats to U.S. interests, Nakasone was noticeably but not
surprisingly reluctant to say much about U.S. offensive operations in
cyberspace. He acknowledged, however, that Cybercom took such action to
disrupt possible Russian interference in the 2018 midterm elections. "We
created a persistent presence in cyberspace to monitor adversary actions
and crafted tools and tactics to frustrate their efforts," he testified
in February. According to press accounts, this included a cyberattack
aimed at paralyzing the Internet Research Agency, a "troll farm" in St.
Petersburg said to have been deeply involved in generating disruptive
propaganda during the 2016 presidential elections.6 Other press
investigations have disclosed two other offensive operations undertaken
by the United States. One called "Olympic Games" was intended to disrupt
Iran's drive to increase its uranium-enrichment capacity by sabotaging
the centrifuges used in the process by infecting them with the so-called
Stuxnet virus. Another left of launch effort was intended to cause
malfunctions in North Korean missile tests.7 Although not aimed at
either of the U.S. principal nuclear adversaries, those two attacks
demonstrated a willingness and capacity to conduct cyberattacks on the
nuclear infrastructure of other states. Efforts by strategic rivals of
the United States to infiltrate and eventually degrade U.S. nuclear
infrastructure are far less documented but thought to be no less
prevalent. Russia, for example, is believed to have planted malware in
the U.S. electrical utility grid, possibly with the intent of cutting
off the flow of electricity to critical NC3 facilities in the event of a
major crisis.8 Indeed, every major power, including the United States,
is believed to have crafted cyberweapons aimed at critical NC3
components and to have implanted malware in enemy systems for potential
use in some future confrontation. Pathways to Escalation Knowing that
the NC3 systems of the major powers are constantly being probed for
weaknesses and probably infested with malware designed to be activated
in a crisis, what does this say about the risks of escalation from a
nonkinetic battle, that is, one fought without traditional weaponry, to
a kinetic one, at first using conventional weapons and then,
potentially, nuclear ones? None of this can be predicted in advance, but
those analysts who have studied the subject worry about the emergence of
dangerous new pathways for escalation. Indeed, several such scenarios
have been identified.9 [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} first and possibly
[[**most dangerous path to escalation** would arise from]{.mark} the
[**early use** of cyberweapons in a great power
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} to ~~paralyze~~ the vital command, control,
and communications capabilities of an adversary, many of which serve
nuclear and conventional forces. In the "fog of war" that would
naturally ensue from such an encounter, [the
[recipient]{.mark}]{.underline} of such an attack [[might fear]{.mark}
more [punishing]{.mark} follow-up kinetic [attacks,]{.mark} possibly
**[including]{.mark} the use of [nuclear weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline},
and, fearing the loss of its own arsenal, launch its weapons
immediately. [[This might occur]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example,
[[in]{.mark} a **[confrontation between NATO and Russia]{.mark}n
forces**]{.underline} in east and central Europe or between U.S. and
Chinese forces in the Asia-Pacific region. Speaking of a possible
confrontation in Europe, for example, James N. Miller Jr. and Richard
Fontaine wrote that "both sides would have overwhelming incentives to go
early with offensive cyber and counter-space capabilities to negate the
other side's military capabilities or advantages." If these early
attacks succeeded, "it could result in huge military and coercive
advantage for the attacker." This might induce the recipient of such
attacks to back down, affording its rival a major victory at very low
cost. Alternatively, however, [the [recipient might view]{.mark} the
[attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} on its critical command, control, and
communications infrastructure [[as]{.mark} the **[prelude to]{.mark} a
[full-scale attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} aimed at neutralizing its
nuclear capabilities [[and]{.mark} **choose to [strike
first]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "It is worth considering," Miller and
Fontaine concluded, "how [[even a]{.mark} very [limited attack]{.mark}
or incident [could set]{.mark} both sides on [a **slippery slope to
rapid escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}."10 U.S. servicemen conduct a

NC3 systems so dangerous is that it may not even need to be activated to
increase the risk of nuclear escalation]{.underline}. [[If a]{.mark}

Pitts-Kiefer wrote in 2018 paper for the Nuclear Threat Initiative.
"\[T\]he introduction of a flaw or malicious code into nuclear weapons
through the supply chain that compromises the effectiveness of those
weapons could lead to a lack of confidence in the nuclear deterrent,"
undermining strategic stability.11 Without confidence in the reliability
of its nuclear weapons infrastructure, a nuclear-armed state may
misinterpret confusing signals from its early-warning systems and,
fearing the worst, launch its own nuclear weapons rather than lose them
to an enemy's first strike. This makes the scenario proffered in the
2018 NPR report, of a nuclear response to an enemy cyberattack, that
much more alarming.

Some argue the US nuclear deterrent should be eliminated because its
existence represents Cold War think. If nuclear deterrence is Cold War
think, then one might posit machine guns are World War I think and main
battle tanks are World War II think and conclude the US does not need
those anymore for the defense of the nation. In fact, nuclear deterrence
is not Cold War think. The reality is [[nuclear deterrence
underpins]{.mark} the **[national security]{.mark}** of the United
States and will **continue to do so** for the foreseeable future. [It
remains relevant]{.mark}]{.underline} and necessary today [[to
deter]{.mark} the **[existential threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} to our
nation [posed by both **Russia** and **China** and]{.underline} by
lesser but certainly horrific threats posed by the Democratic People's
Republic of [**North Korea**. [It]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[helps]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[deter]{.mark} nonnuclear attacks that
could have [**catastrophic consequences**, such as]{.mark} attacks
involving **[bio]{.mark}**logical [**weapons**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
term Cold War think is a pejorative typically proffered by those who
have never thought seriously about, let alone studied, deterrence theory
or by those who have run out of ways to defend their position. It is
generally the last throwaway line of argument from an uninformed
antinuclear ideologue. "No One Would Ever Use a Nuclear Weapon against
the United States" Those who would use this argument seem willing to
risk the very existence of the nation on the basis of their speculation
and without forethought. However, this is not a wager military planners
should ever risk. The [[US]{.mark} military [must ensure]{.mark}
**national [survival]{.mark} through deterrence** [provided by a]{.mark}
**safe**, **[secure]{.mark}**, **capable**, **reliable**, **flexible**,
and **vigilant [nuclear posture]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} It is our duty to
**assume the worst** and then take steps to ensure it never
happens.]{.underline} Additionally, [[we must deter attacks on]{.mark}
our friends, **[allies]{.mark}**, and fielded **US military forces**
deployed abroad. This will become more challenging [as **Russia**,
**China**, and **North Korea**]{.mark} appear to [include]{.mark} the
possible **[employment of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}** in their
planning; indeed, Russia and North Korea openly discuss nuclear weapons
as instruments to be used [in]{.mark} future **[conventional
conflicts]{.mark}** with the US and **NATO**.]{.underline}

### 1ac -- NATO Unity

#### Diverging cyber security policies lock in current rifts in the alliance.

Dr. Max **Smeets 21** \[Center for Security Studies, ETH Zürich
(Switzerland). "**[NATO allies']{.underline}** offensive cyber policy: A
growing divide?". August 6, 2021.
https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/\]

Yet [when it comes to the direction of allies' cyber
policy]{.underline}, [**growing differences** are apparent]{.underline}
-- [especially in the development and deployment **offensive cyber
capabilities**]{.underline}. First, even though most states now have --
or are in the process of -- establishing a cyber command, operational
[capabilities vastly differ across states]{.underline}. Whereas some
governments are increasingly allocating significant resources to conduct
cyber operations -- and are now starting to benefit from these
investments -- [the majority of allies still run their cyber commands on
a budget of a few million a year]{.underline} --[an amount that is
**insufficient for effective operations** in the cyber
domain.]{.underline} Secondly, [**until a few years ago**, NATO members'
strategic visions were largely aligned]{.underline}. National cyber
strategies shared a common threat focus on operations that could
potentially cause major societal havoc, such as taking down the power
grid. Allies' national strategies were also largely unified in their
vision to address this threat, discussing the need for deterrence,
resilience, and norms. However, [this changed with the publication of
the US Department of Defense's strategy on Defend Forward and US Cyber
Command's vision on Persistent Engagement.]{.underline}\[8\] [The United
States emphasizes the need to **cause friction**]{.underline} "wherever
the adversary maneuvers," [operating "**globally**, **continuously** and
seamlessly"]{.underline} (potentially) below the threshold of armed
attack. "We must...maneuver seamlessly across the interconnected
battlespace, globally, as close as possible to adversaries and their
operations, and continuously shape the battlespace to create operational
advantage for us while denying the same to our adversaries," in the
words of NSA director and Cyber Command head Gen. Paul Nakasone.\[9\]
Whereas [deterrence is about changing your adversary's cost-benefit
calculus, Persistent Engagement is about taking the opportunity away
from the adversary to act.\[]{.underline}10\] Third, [NATO member
positions on how international law applies]{.underline} -- particularly
the obligations of states vis-a-vis sovereignty -- **[are now more
divergent]{.underline}** than a decade ago. Whereas countries like [the
**Netherlands** and **France** are located on the side of the
**"sovereignty as a rule"**]{.underline} camp, [the **U**nited
**K**ingdom]{.underline} [has taken the position that a remote cyber
operation by one state into another's cyber systems or network does not
violate the latter's sovereignty.]{.underline}

[The **divergence in cyber policy** across NATO member states **is
problematic**]{.underline}. [Allies disagree on both the **goals** of
cyber policy **and** **the ways and means** to achieve
them.]{.underline} [This **can cause tension** between
allies]{.underline}, especially when it comes to the necessity and
legitimacy of operating on each other's national systems and networks.
[Some may argue that these differences result from differences in
maturity]{.underline}. Some states simply have not caught up with the
latest developments, goes the argument. [This assumes a single path to
cyber maturity or that the dynamics of cyberspace pull all states in the
same direction.]{.underline} [It suggests that]{.underline} -- even
**[without major policy coordination]{.underline}** -- [allies' cyber
policies will converge over time]{.underline}. [But a more persuasive
understanding]{.underline} of the current trend [is that even though
states can learn from each other's institutional progress, **differences
do not merely stem from states "lagging behind."**]{.underline} [These
states are on a **different policy path**]{.underline}. [This means it
requires dedicated and sustained policy attention]{.underline} to, at a
minimum, [coordinating the different policies of states -- and
potentially **bring them closer together**. What can be done to ensure
that this **divergence** in cyber policy does not cause **further
friction between allies**?\[11\] What can be done to ensure that this
**divergence** in cyber policy does not cause **further friction between
allies**]{.underline}?\[11\] I have previously proposed **[a
NATO]{.underline}** Memorandum of Understanding (**[MoU]{.underline}**)
[to]{.underline} **[reduce discord among the allies]{.underline}**; the
goal **[would]{.underline}** be to [enhance **trust**, **transparency**,
**and confidence** between allies]{.underline} [and to **improve the
effectiveness of disrupting and deterring adversaries' operations in
cyberspace**]{.underline}.\[12\] [The main purpose of the MoU would be
to **reach an agreement** on the equities involved in permitting
signatories to conduct cyber effect operations in **each other's
networks**]{.underline}---and the relative weight of those equities.

#### Russia will exploit divisions between NATO members to instigate nuclear crises\-\--extinction.

European Leadership Network; European Leadership Network, "Envisioning a
Russia-NATO Conflict: Implications for Deterrence Stability,"

Escalation: Can a NATO - Russia conflict be managed?

[[Once]{.mark} a [conflict was **under way**, the "**fog of war**"
and]{.mark} **rising [unpredictability]{.mark}** [would **inevitably**
set]{.mark} in, **complicating** the implementation of any]{.underline}
predetermined theories of escalation, deescalation and inter-[conflict
management. The **actual** dynamics of]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline} and the perceptions of the stakes involved [are
**extremely difficult** to predict. Simulations]{.underline} and
table-top exercises can [give]{.underline} only [limited
insights]{.underline} into the actual decision-making processes and
interactions.

Still, [[Russian]{.mark} military [theorists]{.mark}]{.underline} and
practitioners seem to **[[assume]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [a
[conflict]{.mark} with NATO [can be]{.mark} **managed** and
**[controlled]{.mark}** in a way that would bring it to a **swift end**
consistent with Russian aims. The [Russian **theory**]{.mark} **of
victory**]{.underline} would [seek to [**exploit weak points**
in]{.mark} an [Alliance]{.mark} war effort. Based on the **conviction**
that democracies are weak and]{.underline} their leaders and populations
are [risk-averse, [Russia]{.mark} may **[assume]{.mark}**
that]{.underline} its [[threats of]{.mark} **horizontal** or **vertical
[escalation]{.mark}** [could be]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly
[[effective. It would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [try to bring home the
notion]{.underline} that [it has **much higher stakes** in the
conflict]{.underline} (regime survival) [than]{.underline} a majority of
the [NATO members]{.underline} involved, [and]{.underline} thus [will be
ready to **[push]{.mark} the [boundaries]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the
[conflict further. It would]{.underline} most likely [[try to]{.mark}
**test** and **[exploit]{.mark}** potential **[divisions]{.mark}**
within the Alliance, combining **selective diplomacy** and
**activation** of its intelligence assets in]{.underline} some [NATO
states]{.underline} with a degree of selectivity in terms of targets of
particular attacks.

[**[Any]{.mark}** NATO-Russia [conflict would]{.mark} **inevitably**
[have a **nuc**]{.mark}**lear [dimension]{.mark}**. The role of
**nuclear weapons** as a tool [for **escalation control**]{.mark} for
Russia has been]{.underline} thoroughly [debated by experts, but
when]{.underline} and how [Russia might use]{.underline} (and not merely
showcase or activate) [nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an **open
question**. Beyond]{.underline} catch phrases such as ["**escalate to
de-escalate**"]{.underline} or "escalate to win" [[there are a]{.mark}
**wider [range]{.mark}** [of options for Russian]{.mark} **nuclear
weapon [use]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [[a single
**nuclear**]{.mark} **warning [shot]{.mark}** [could be lethal]{.mark}
or non-lethal. It could be directed against a]{.underline} purely
[military target or a]{.underline} military-[civilian one. [Detonation
could be]{.mark} configured for an [**EMP effect**. A "**false
flag**"]{.mark} attack is]{.underline} also [conceivable. These
options]{.underline} might be used to [**signal escalation** and could
**significantly [complicate]{.mark}** NATO's
[responses]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. [It is less
clear how far the Alliance would be **willing to escalate** the
conflict]{.underline} to achieve these goals, [and what
mechanisms]{.underline} and means [it would use while trying to
maintain]{.underline} some degree of [control]{.underline} over the
conflict.

[The goals]{.underline} and methods [of waging a [conflict]{.mark} with
Russia [would]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[have to be limited]{.mark}
in order [to avoid]{.mark} a **massive [nuclear exchang]{.mark}e**. Such
limitations]{.underline} would also involve restrictions on striking
back against targets on Russian territory. But too narrow an approach
[could put **too much restraint** on NATO's operations: the Russian
**regime's stability** may]{.underline} ultimately [need to be
threatened]{.underline} in order [to **force the leadership** into
**terminating** the conflict]{.underline}. NATO would thus need to
establish what a proportional self-defence response to Russian actions
would involve, and to what extent cyber operations or attacks against
military targets in quite different parts of Russia would be useful as
tools of escalation to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover, individual NATO
Allies, especially those directly affected by Russia's actions, might
pursue their individual strategies of escalation.

With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance, with the US taking the
lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

[[Relying on]{.mark} concepts of **[escalation
control]{.mark}**]{.underline} and on lessons [from the Cold
War]{.underline} confrontation [[might be **misleading**]{.mark}. The
circumstances in which a [**Russia-NATO conflict** would]{.mark} play
out would [be]{.mark} **radically different** from the 20th
century]{.underline} screenplay. Moreover, [instead of
**gradual**]{.underline} (linear) [escalation or **salami tactics**
escalation, it is possible to imagine]{.underline} surprizing [["**leap
frog**" escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}, possibly
[connected]{.underline} with actions [in **different
domains**]{.underline} (e.g. a cyberattack against critical
infrastructure). Flexibility, good intelligence and inventiveness in
responding to such developments would be crucial.

Conflict termination

[Russian and NATO assumptions regarding conflict termination
would]{.underline} most likely [**not survive** the **first hours**
of]{.underline} an [actual conflict. [Both sides]{.mark} are capable of
**[underestimat]{.mark}ing** the **[resolve]{.mark}** of the other side
to prevail]{.underline} in a conflict [and the other side's
**willingness** to]{.underline} commit the necessary resources and
[endure the costs, especially once both]{.underline} sides [start
committing]{.underline} their [political capital]{.underline} and
resources and the casualties accumulate.

#### Russian cyber ops are the key to their strategy of disrupting NATO unity- fragmentation gives Russia leverage to increase populism.

EASTERN FLANK TO WESTERN ELECTIONS: RUSSIAN OPERATIONS AGAINST THE EU
AND NATO; The Center for European Policy Analysis;
https://cepa.org/the-evolution-of-russian-hybrid-warfare-eu-nato/

While Russian influence operations have a history that goes far beyond
the concept of hybrid warfare, they have seldom gotten such attention.
This chapter investigates the evolution of Russian hybrid means and the
ends to which they are applied. [The Russian leadership's best bet
against the collective West is currently in these
operations]{.underline}. [The core of countering them lies in changing
the Russian cost-benefit analysis that suggests]{.underline}, so far,
[that conducting these operations holds great rewards]{.underline} and
carries fairly small risks.¶ 1. RUSSIAN GOALS AND THE LIMITS OF RUSSIAN
POWER¶ [At their foundations]{.underline}, the European Union (EU) and
**[NATO are based on a political agreement that acknowledges mutual
interests,]{.underline}** security, and support. [This is the focus of
the conflict between Russia and the West]{.underline} (here shorthand
for the EU and NATO). **[Russia stands little chance of prevailing in
this conflict in the face of a committed and united West]{.underline}**.
Conversely, **[it has a great opportunity to succeed against a divided
West]{.underline}**. Unfortunately, **[many divisions exist that can be
exploited]{.underline}**. [Fragmenting the West's political unity lies
at the core of Russia's strategy as it seeks to promote economic ties
with some European states]{.underline} --- Germany and France ---
**[while isolating and provoking others]{.underline}**. This paper
focuses on Russian influence operations against both the EU and NATO as
well as individual member states.¶ [The Russian leadership's ability to
achieve its goals]{.underline} --- [regime security]{.underline} and
great power status [through weakening]{.underline} the EU and
[NATO]{.underline} --- [comes from its power of destruction]{.underline}
rather than its power of attraction. Russia has few true allies in the
world. Even China, which shares an increasingly close relationship with
Russia, cannot be considered an ally.1¶ [The United States and Europe
have seen increasing political polarization and decreasing trust in
democracy]{.underline} over the past few decades.2 **[Russia has sought
to exploit this fact through its support for far-right and populist
actors and movements that are united in their opposition
to]{.underline}** the EU, **[NATO]{.underline}**, or simply "the
establishment."3 [This enables Russia to have a destructive influence
over processes that are already contentious]{.underline}.¶ [Elections
and referenda,]{.underline} which, in essence, are processes to settle
political contention, [are particularly vulnerable.]{.underline} The
core idea of popular votes is that even if one's own side does not win,
one will accept the outcome as the process was free and fair. [There
is,]{.underline} therefore, **[an incentive for Russia to influence the
outcome of these processes to sow doubt and create
instability]{.underline}**.4 [The European Parliament accurately
summarized the goal of Russian cyber operations]{.underline} targeting
the EU [as]{.underline}: "distorting truths, provoking doubt, [dividing
Member States, engineering a strategic split between the European Union
and its North American partners]{.underline} and paralyzing the
decision-making process, [discrediting]{.underline} the EU institutions
and [transatlantic partnerships]{.underline} ... undermining and eroding
the European narrative based on democratic values, human rights and the
rule of law."5

[Nationalist **populists** as leaders of states that possess nuclear
weapons **undermine the nuclear order** and increase nuclear **dangers**
in novel, significant, and persistent ways]{.underline}. Such leaders
talk differently about nuclear weapons; they can put nuclear policy
making and crisis management in disarray; and they can weaken
international alliances and multilateral nuclear institutions. The rise
of nationalist populists in nuclear-armed states, including some of the
five nuclear-weapon states recognized under the 1968 Treaty on the
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, shatters the presumed distinction
between responsible and irresponsible nuclear powers and complicates
attempts to heal rifts in the international order. Policies to wait out
populists or to balance their influence in multilateral institutions
seem to have had limited success. A sustainable strategy to deal with
the challenge posed by populists would need to start by recognizing that
we can no longer assume that nuclear weapons are safe in the hands of
some states but not in others'. Introduction **[The rise of nationalist
populists1 to power in nuclear-armed states and their allies is
undermining the nuclear order and raising the risks of nuclear
war]{.underline}**. [That populists such as Boris Johnson, Narendra
Modi, Vladimir Putin, and Donald Trump were able to take charge of
nuclear arsenals, including in some of the nuclear powers recognized
under the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),
challenges the assumption that established nuclear-weapon states behave
responsibly.]{.underline} Nationalist populism,2 understood as a
nationalist, anti-elitist, illiberal, and anti-pluralist set of ideas
and politics conducted in the supposed interests of "the people" ---
that is, the domestic constituencies of the nationalist-populist
leaders---has been on the rise globally since the mid-2000s. It has come
to include the leadership of a growing number of countries3 and has
begun to influence the effectiveness of time-honored institutions of the
nuclear order. We argue that this rise of nationalist populists and
their foreign and defense policies weakens the nuclear order in novel,
significant, and persistent ways. [Three characteristics are typical of
nationalist populists' nuclear policies: they talk differently about
nuclear weapons; they have a specific way of getting involved in
national decision making on nuclear-weapon issues; and their approach to
international alliances and institutions is unique.]{.underline} [The
fact that nationalist-populist leaders]{.underline} have assumed control
over nuclear weapons in countries at the core of the nuclear order
shat[ters the presumed distinction between "responsible" and
"irresponsible" nuclear powers. These leaders **threaten the nuclear
order** built on the principled acceptance of a logic of restraint by
the nuclear-weapon states]{.underline}.

#### Russian cyber ops undermine NATO unity through the spread of disinformation, which causes democratic backsliding.

[Given Russia's military shortcomings in Ukraine, many in the West are
already celebrating his failure]{.underline}. However, [it is too early
to do so]{.underline}, in [part because Putin still has a
powerful]{.underline} non-military [tool]{.underline} at his disposal:
**[information weapons]{.underline}**. [The Kremlin]{.underline} does
not limit itself to hacking our computers --- it also [wants
to]{.underline} hack our minds, aiming to **[disrupt our democracies,
polarize our societies, and sow fear and doubt]{.underline}** among our
populations.¶ [The importance of information operations is clear to
anyone who follows Russia closely]{.underline}. [The
Soviets]{.underline} were known for "active measures." They [used
disinformation campaigns to shape the information space abroad and
influence events in other countries;]{.underline} they often referred to
these campaigns as "political warfare."¶ **[Russian active measures
today do not differ]{.underline}** **[in their goals]{.underline}**.
[The only difference is in the technology used]{.underline} to pursue
them. [Social media platforms allow Russia]{.underline} both
[to]{.underline} increase its reach and to [target specific
audiences]{.underline} when conducting information operations, [which
Moscow uses]{.underline} both [for political warfare]{.underline} and to
augment conventional military operations. Last year,
[Russia]{.underline} [published]{.underline} [a]{.underline} new
National [Security Strategy, in which it devoted an entire section to
"information security]{.underline}." Similarly, [Russian Minister of
Defense]{.underline} Sergey Shoigu [declared that "information has
become a weapon]{.underline}." In 2017, Russian officials acknowledged
the establishment of information warfare troops.¶ **[Moscow's
information operations and other hybrid warfare undertakings in Europe
aim to undermine]{.underline}** European security [**and NATO
unity.**¶]{.underline} **[Russia's information campaigns are integral
part of its hybrid warfare strategy]{.underline}**. Russian information
operations against Ukraine kicked into high gear in 2014. When the war
started, Russia used disinformation to shape the information space. For
instance, Moscow claimed that NATO's enlargement was a threat to Russia.
Russia and Putin have spread a long line of such falsehoods about
Ukraine. Moscow claimed that Russian-language speakers in Ukraine faced
"genocide" at Kyiv's hands and would welcome a Russian invasion. Moscow
denied Ukrainian statehood, claiming Ukraine has always been part of
Russia and framing its "special military operation" as necessary to
"liberate" Ukrainians from their "Nazi leader." [This messaging was
intended to be consumed inside Russia, in Ukraine, and
globally]{.underline}. Ukraine, which has been strengthening its
information operations tools for over a decade, has achieved notable
victories in this space since the war began.

#### Democracy [solves]{.underline} every impact\-\--it's comparatively [more stable]{.underline} than autocracies

Matt **Kroenig 20,** Professor of government and foreign service at
Georgetown. 4/3 "Why the U.S. Will Outcompete China"
<https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/why-china-ill-equipped-great-power-rivalry/609364/>

National-security analysts see China as one of the greatest threats
facing the United States and its allies. [According to an emerging
conventional wisdom, China has the leg up on the U.S. in part because
its authoritarian government can strategically plan for the long term,
unencumbered by competing branches of government, regular elections, and
public opinion]{.underline}. **[Yet this faith in autocratic ascendance
and democratic decline is contrary to historical fact. China may be able
to put forth big, bold plans]{.underline}**---the kinds of projects that
analysts think of as long term---**[but the visionary projects of
autocrats don't usually pan out]{.underline}**. Watch White Noise, the
inside story of the alt-right The Atlantic's first feature documentary
ventures into the underbelly of the far-right movement to explore the
seductive power of extremism. Stream Now Yes, [democratic governments
are obligated to answer to their citizens on regular intervals and are
sensitive to public opinion---t**hat's actually democracies' greatest
source of strength. Democratic leaders have a harder time advancing big,
bold agendas**, but the upside of that difficulty is that the plans that
do make it through the system have been carefully considered and enjoy
domestic support]{.underline}. Historically speaking, once a democracy
comes up with a successful strategy, it sticks with the plan, even
through a succession of leadership. Washington has arguably followed the
same basic, three-step geopolitical plan since 1945. First, the United
States built the current, rules-based international system by providing
security in important geopolitical regions, constructing international
institutions, and promoting free markets and democratic politics within
its sphere of influence. Second, it welcomed into the club any country
that played by the rules, even former adversaries, like Germany and
Japan. And, third, the U.S. worked with its allies to defend the system
from those countries or groups that would challenge it, including
competitors such as Russia and China, rogue states such as Iran and
North Korea, and terrorist networks. America can pursue long-term
strategy in part because it enjoys domestic political stability. While
new politicians seek to improve on their predecessor's policies, the
United States is unlikely to see the drastic shifts in strategy that
come from the fall of one political system and the rise of another.
[Democratic elections may be messy, but they're not as messy as coups or
civil wars.]{.underline} Daniel Blumenthal: The Unpredictable Rise of
China **[Open societies]{.underline}** have many other advantages as
well. They **[facilitate innovation]{.underline}**, **[trust in
financial markets]{.underline}**, and economic growth. Because
**[democracies]{.underline}** tend to be more reliable partners, they
**[are typically skillful alliance builders]{.underline}**, and they can
accumulate resources without frightening their neighbors. **[They tend
to make thoughtful, informed decisions on matters of war and
peace]{.underline}**, and to focus their security forces on external
enemies, not their own populations. Autocratic systems simply cannot
match this impressive array of economic, diplomatic, and military
attributes. David Leonhardt recently wrote in The New York Times,
"Chinese leaders stretching back to Deng Xiaoping have often thought in
terms of decades." Commonly cited examples of that long-term thinking
include the Belt and Road Initiative, a program that invests in
infrastructure overseas; Made in China 2025, an effort to subsidize
China's giant tech companies to become world leaders in 21st-century
technologies, such as artificial intelligence; and Beijing's promise to
be a global superpower by 2049. Since putting in place sound economic
reforms in the 1970s, China has seen its economy expand at eye-popping
rates, to become the world's second largest. Many economists predict
that China could even surpass the United States within the decade, and
some have suggested that China's model of state-led capitalism will
prove more successful, in terms of economic growth, than the U.S.
template of free markets and open politics. I doubt these predictions.
Because autocratic leaders are unconstrained and do not have to contend
with a legislature or courts, they have an easier time taking their
countries in new and radically different directions. Then, when the
dictator changes his mind, he can do it again. Mao's autocratic China
ricocheted from one failed policy to another: the Great Leap Forward,
then the Hundred Flowers Campaign, then the Cultural Revolution. Mao
aligned with the Soviet Union in 1950 only to nearly fight a nuclear war
with Moscow in the next decade. Beginning in the time of Deng Xiaoping,
China pursued a fairly constant strategy of liberalizing its economy at
home and "hiding its capabilities and biding its time" abroad. But
President Xi Jinping abandoned these dictums when he took over. As the
most powerful leader since Mao---he has changed China's constitution to
set himself up as dictator for life---he could once again jerk China in
several new directions, according to his whims, and back again.
According to the Asia Society, he has stalled or reversed course on
eight of 10 categories of economic reform promised by the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) itself. Moreover, Xi is baring China's teeth
militarily, taking contested territory from neighbors in the South China
Sea and conducting military exercises with Russia in Europe. The problem
for Beijing is that stalled reforms will stymie its economic potential
and its confrontational policies are provoking an international
coalition to contain them. The 2017 U.S. National Security Strategy
declared great-power competition with China the foremost security threat
to the U.S.; the European Union labeled China a "systemic rival"; and
Japan, Australia, India, and the United States have formed a new "quad"
of powers to balance China in the Pacific. Furthermore, the plans often
cited as evidence of China's farsighted vision, the Belt and Road
Initiative and Made in China 2025, were announced by Xi only in 2013 and
2015, respectively. Both are way too recent to be celebrated as
brilliant examples of successful, long-term strategic planning. [A
certain level of domestic political stability is a prerequisite for
charting a steady strategic course in foreign and domestic
affairs.]{.underline} **[But autocratic regimes are notoriously brittle.
While institutionalized political successions in democracies typically
lead to changes of policy, political successions in autocracies are
likely to result in regime collapse and war]{.underline}**. China's
"5,000 years of history" were pockmarked by rebellion, revolution, and
new dynasties. Fearing internal threats to domestic political
stability---consider the protests this year in Hong Kong and
Xinjiang---the CCP spends more on domestic security than on its national
defense. If you follow the money, the CCP is demonstrating that the
government is more afraid of its own people than of the Pentagon. This
domestic fragility will frustrate China's efforts to design and execute
farsighted plans. If threats to Chinese domestic stability were to
materialize and the CCP were to collapse tomorrow, for example, Chinese
grand strategy could undergo another seismic shift, including possibly
opting out of competition with the United States altogether. Shadi
Hamid: China Is Avoiding Blame by Trolling the World Autocracies have
other vulnerabilities as **[well. State-led planning has never produced
high rates of economic growth over the long term. Autocrats are poor
alliance builders]{.underline}** who fight with their supposed allies
more than with their enemies. And the highest priority of autocratic
security forces is repressing their own people, not defending the
country. [The world has undergone drastic changes in just the past few
years, but these enduring patterns of international affairs have
not]{.underline}. Some fear that Trump's nationalist tendencies will
erode the U.S. position, but the momentum of America's successful grand
strategy has kept the country on a fairly steady course. Despite Trump's
criticism of NATO, for example, two new countries have joined the
alliance on his watch, including North Macedonia this week. The
coronavirus has upended a sense of security in the U.S., leading many
people into the familiar trap of lauding autocratic China's firm
response in contrast to the halting and patchwork measures in the United
States. But there is good reason to believe that this assessment will be
updated in America's favor with the benefit of hindsight. Already we are
seeing evidence that conditions are much worse in China than CCP
officials are letting on and that China's attempts at international
"disaster diplomacy" are backfiring. It has been revealed that the CCP
has continually misrepresented the numbers of COVID-19 infections and
deaths in China, and European nations have rejected and returned faulty
Chinese coronavirus testing kits.

**[Action Plan]{.underline}** for the Next Five Years **[To make NATO
future-proof, it must be cyber-secure and operational.]{.underline}**
But is it doing enough to address the complex and evolving challenges of
cyberspace? NATO's strategic challenge is to blend its successful
conventional deterrence functions with a new strategy for cyber action.
[NATO's ability to send a collective message of resistance and to
establish a credible threat response is its most valuable asset on the
cyber-security front]{.underline}. [Four sets of actions for NATO are
proposed. First, **denying covertness by attribution**:]{.underline}
NATO should persuade opponents that they cannot be clandestine in their
cyber actions. NATO and its members need to demonstrate that it is
difficult or impossible to act covertly and be clear about attributing
responsibility for cyberattacks. Until recently, governments did not
publicly release details on cyber incidents. But since 2018, public
disclosures of cyberattacks by several Western powers indicate a new
multinational policy of state transparency. [The growing relevance of
attribution is partially due to states becoming better at attributing
cyber operations.]{.underline}1 [Greater public knowledge of
cyberattacks heightens awareness of cyber conflicts and leads to greater
**public acceptance of cyber countermeasures**]{.underline}. Ultimately,
what matters is that states engaging in unlawful actions using cyber
means will face consequences. With attribution, policymakers show that
they know what is happening in these networks and can investigate
incidents. It also clearly spells out unacceptable behavior and can help
create state practice. [The best way to implement the international
norms is by calling out behavior and having consequences when these
norms are breached.]{.underline} [Attribution will make
clear]{.underline} to the malicious actor that their actions will be
seen and addressed. It is the basis, under international law, for
countermeasures and self-defense. When should states publicly attribute
cyberattacks? [Effective public attribution requires a clear
understanding of the attributed cyber operation and the cyber-threat
actor, but also the broader geopolitical environment, allied positions
and activities, and the legal context]{.underline}. **[The public
attribution framework]{.underline}** put forward by Max Smeets and
Florian Egloff in March 2021 27 [distinguishes four factors]{.underline}
that act as enablers or constraints in public attribution. These factors
are intelligence, incident severity, geopolitical context, and
post-attribution actions. [The combination of these four components
enables consistent decision-making about whether to publicly disseminate
information]{.underline} about an adversary's actions, privately tell
the adversary, or restrict knowledge of the intrusion to the government
and potentially other partners. **[Collecting and processing
intelligence]{.underline}**---information about foreign countries and
their agents--- [**provides a technical basis for attribution.** How
could allies improve intelligence sharing to conduct more rapid
attribution and enable a response to adversary cyber
activity?]{.underline} During the Nordic-Baltic foreign ministers
meeting in Tallinn in September 2020, a 90-minute tabletop exercise was
organized28 to test the ministers' ability to respond to and attribute
an escalating cyberattack. They answered multiple-choice questions on
communication of and possible diplomatic countermeasures to the attack.
The ministers learned through first-hand experience that a timely
exchange of technical intelligence can be key in attributing any
cyberattack. "The shared view \[of the countries involved\]---especially
when it comes to complicated issues---is crucial," said Urmas Reinsalu,
Foreign Minister of Estonia.29 [Attribution is only as good as the
information that allies are willing to share.]{.underline} **[NATO's
value can be in becoming the preferred platform for sharing cyber
information]{.underline}**. General Paul Nakasone, who heads US Cyber
Command, told the House Armed Services subcommittee on intelligence that
"in 35 years" he has never seen a better sharing of accurate, timely,
and actionable intelligence than what has transpired with Ukraine. 30
[**Sharing information and intelligence** with allies "**builds
coalitions"** and can "shine a light on disinformation"
campaigns,]{.underline} like the one Russia used to lay the groundwork
for their invasion of Ukraine. As the second course of action, NATO
should use the current crisis to accelerate the progress with setting up
NATO's own cyber command and sharpen allied responses to malicious cyber
actions. Overall, this would give more credibility to its cyber defense.
In February 2019, allies endorsed a set of tools to respond to
cumulative cyber activities, but not much has happened to take it
forward. It is now time to build upon this set and develop concrete
steps at the political, military, and technical levels to model alliance
behavior according to the threat landscape. This means a sharper focus
on future responses to highand low-end cyberattacks along with concrete
deterrence actions and tools for individual sectors and target types.
[Much of this is based on the high-end cyber capabilities of select
individual allies called "volunteer sovereign cyber effects," where
cybercapable nations deliver voluntarily offensive cyber effects on a
target designated by an operational-level commander.]{.underline} The
NATO Cyber Command would be responsible for matching military needs with
the willingness and capabilities of the nations potentially able to
deliver such effects.31 [The alliance should clarify which allies are
responsible for offensive cyber operations against certain targets and
the information-sharing and notification requirements. **A good plan
requires practice**]{.underline}. The scenarios of cyber responses that
are under the Article 5 threshold should be regularly practiced, and the
NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) Locked
Shields exercise is a good way to do so. Organized since 2010, it
enables cyber-security experts to enhance their skills in defending
national IT systems and critical infrastructure under real-time attacks.
The focus should be on realistic scenarios simulating the entire
complexity of a massive cyber incident, including strategic
decision-making and legal and communication aspects. [Locked Shields is
a unique opportunity to encourage experimentation, **training, and
cooperation** among]{.underline} allies in an authentic but safe
training environment. [NATO should also make more use of its Cyber
Range]{.underline}, a platform for NATO exercises and training in
Estonia operated by the Estonian Ministry of Defense. The Cyber Range
already facilitates NATO's flagship annual cyber defense exercise Cyber
Coalition, and NATO CCDCOE has based Locked Shields on Cyber Range for
over a decade. The versatility and computing power of the platform
allows a different, complex scenario to be simulated every year for an
increasing number of participants. The technical, red-teaming exercise
CrossedSwords, organized by NATO CCDCOE, tests the capabilities and
skills needed when executing a full-spectrum cyber operation in real
life, focusing on experimentation with integrating kinetics and
offensive cyber operations in the context of a modern battlefield. [More
operational- and technical-level joint activities should be practiced
among allies and with likeminded partners in order to contribute to
imposing costs to malicious actors in cyberspace.]{.underline} [Given
that NATO's cyber response teams are stretched thin due to protecting
NATO's own networks, bi- and multilateral **collaboration enables
countries to share best practices**]{.underline} and, in the event of an
emergency, provide mutual rapid assistance in crisis response. The cyber
exercise Baltic Ghost originated from a series of cyber defense
workshops in 2013 and should be expanded to include all NATO
battlegroups in the Baltics and Poland. Currently it is facilitated by
the United States European Command with the objective to develop and
sustain cyber partnerships between Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania on one
end, and the Maryland, Michigan, and Pennsylvania Army National Guards
on the other end. Building on the success of Baltic Ghost, **[regular
cyber exercises should take place in multinational NATO battlegroups,
led by]{.underline}** the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and **[the
United States]{.underline}**, in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.
[Future exercises should regularly support NATO enhanced forward
presence forces and train participants to respond to aggression in a
contested, degraded, and denied cyberspace environment]{.underline}.
[The third action focuses on building resilience of domestic critical
infrastructures]{.underline}. Doors are locked to keep homes safe.
Likewise, all NATO member states should address their digital insecurity
by locking digital doors as individuals, companies, and countries. The
strategic vulnerability to disruption and sabotage lies not so much in
the military space but in the hospital booking system, logistics
schedule, power grid, and thousands of other mainstream, civilian,
mostly privately owned networks. Based on the 2016 Cyber Defence Pledge,
in which member states committed to improving their ability to protect
their cyber networks, [the alliance could formulate a NATO
cyber-security baseline with **concrete resilience goals** to achieve or
maintain the baseline]{.underline}. [These resilience goals could then
be apportioned among member states in the same way as the
defense-planning capability targets]{.underline}. [This should come with
obvious financial and investment implications.]{.underline} Public
debates on burden sharing within NATO for too long have focused on how
much member states spend on defense in isolation, without adequate
prioritizing where those funds are going. Member states should be
rethink defense spending relative to emerging threats and collective
security challenges. To ensure funding for cyber security is
appropriately prioritized, [NATO should strengthen a commitment to
digital defense spending,]{.underline} building on the strong base it
has developed in terms of doctrine, standards, and requirements. This
also includes strengthening the political resilience of member states by
broadening NATO consultations to include more areas of government.
Regular North Atlantic Council-format meetings among member state
directors of cyber authorities at the political and military levels
would help build consensus on cyber policy issues. [Another course of
action for NATO in cyber security is to increase its cyber
**capacity-building efforts** for partner countries of strategic
importance, reinforcing NATO's commitment to partners and projecting
stability in NATO's neighborhood]{.underline}. This kind of cyber
capacity-building could include various types of support, **[ranging
from strategic advice and cyber institution-building in defense sectors
to education and training or advice and assistance in cyber
defense]{.underline}**. The objective should to be to enable
capacity-building activities for military actors, along with the
provision of training, equipment, and infrastructure for security
purposes. [This would allow NATO to improve the capacities of partners
to address crises, prevent conflicts, and cater for their own security
and stability by themselves, to the benefit of their
population.]{.underline} As one example, NATO could fill a gap in
capacity building for partner countries by bringing together military
Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) to share information on
incident management dynamics, a key factor in modern cyber defense.
While partner countries can receive support from donors in establishing
mechanisms and processes to exchange information between civilian CERTs,
such cooperation and communication channels are much less developed in
the military domain due in large part to the high sensitivity of the
information. There is a need to extend the information-sharing practices
used in civilian circles to partner countries' military CERTs. Building
cyber-security capacity should focus on partners' ability to respond to
and recover from cyber incidents. In sum, most future conflicts will
have cyber components that require a technical, political, and
diplomatic response. Whether the adversary is a state's elite unit or a
criminal group rendering ransomware as a service, cyber security is
about risk management and solid, pragmatic defense and response measures
to improve the security of the digital environment. There is a technical
aspect to hardening defenses and building redundancy in data and
services, but the core of resilience lies in leadership that does not
ignore the problem. How our national cyber-security strategies are
translated into policies and procedures needs to be understood by all
stakeholders. It is now up to the alliance's member states to provide
clarity and coherence to successfully draft a new Strategic Concept that
includes defense and deterrence. But this is not a job for NATO
alone---it requires close coordination across national governments and
the private sector, and NATO and the European Union must therefore
continue to work very closely on this vital issue.

#### Increased US cyber security cooperation, in the form of intelligence sharing and training, solves NATO cohesion and cyber deterrence.

Long-Term Thinking [In the long run]{.underline}, though, **[the
U.S]{.underline}**. and its more technologically advanced allies---such
as its fellow Five Eyes (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K.),
France and Japan---[**will have to make important policy changes** in
the interests of furthering alliance cooperation in cyberspace: **a
willingness to sometimes risk sensitive sources** and methods in order
to get cyber threat intelligence into the hands of other countries
better positioned to take policy action, an end to classifying public
information like IP addresses solely because of their acquisition via
classified means, and **greater transparency** on their own
decision-making. Government cyber leaders within the alliance should
consider]{.underline} taking another page out of the private-sector
playbook as well: [running cyber-crisis exercises that involve more than
the IT department]{.underline}. In the commercial world, the more
successful practice runs involve leaders at both the CISO level and some
presence from nontechnical teams that would weigh in during a crisis,
such as communications and legal. The best exercises involve executives,
too, who despite their busy schedules must see for themselves how their
companies would survive and respond during a potentially ruinous
cyberattack, and work through the minutiae of leading a response
themselves. [The experience and confidence is invaluable if ever called
on during a real-life crisis, and the organizational introspection by
involving decision-makers at all levels is irreplaceable.
**Military-to-military cyber training** as part of cross-country force
standardization and joint operational planning could pull in more senior
national leadership]{.underline}, beyond battlefield commanders, and be
coupled with increased funding for foreign affairs-led training for
nontechnical leaders. The private sector could also meaningfully
contribute during NATO consultations when developing Allied Joint
Publications to make sure that definitions and requirements for threat
intelligence incorporate the best practices of NATO member countries'
private sectors. If a U.S. diplomat reaches out to his or her
counterpart in an allied country to ask for assistance responding to
malware that's damaging critical infrastructure, and that counterpart
has to ask what malware is, the response isn't going to happen. \*\*\*
[NATO's essential and enduring purpose is to safeguard the **freedom and
security** of all its members by political and military
means.]{.underline} [Tolerating cyberattacks]{.underline}, especially
those deliberately targeting civilians and the political legitimacy of
governments---[without the alliance having the capability to jointly
discuss attribution]{.underline} and have the confidence to act and
assist one another---**[undermines this core purpose of the
alliance]{.underline}**. Likewise, [pursuing only deterrence and
response without an active role for the alliance in reaching peaceful
diplomatic agreements]{.underline} with potential adversaries abrogates
member responsibilities to their citizens but [is impossible without a
common language and operational picture to discuss enforcement of such
agreements.]{.underline} [The U.S. is stronger with allies, and with
attention to these issues its cybersecurity can be too]{.underline}.

#### NATO cooperation is key -- cyber system resilience depends on coordinated information sharing. The plan spills up, and out, to include all allied networks.

**['Safe-to-Fail': Building Cyber Resilience into NATO]{.underline}**
[The political and technical dynamics discussed in the previous section
highlight the necessity of a safe-to-fail strategy for NATO in the cyber
domain.]{.underline} **[Cyber resilience offers a way for the Alliance
to address a range of threats]{.underline}** below the threshold of
armed conflict to which fail-deadly and fail-safe strategies fail to
apply---such as ransomware attacks, distributed denials of service,
exploitation of digital supply chains, or operations conducted by
non-state proxy actors. Moreover, even low-sophistication cyberattacks
can produce disruptive and cascading effects across societies with
consequences that are difficult to anticipate. [**Resilience thus offers
a broader strategic umbrella** for the Alliance to plan for, recover
from, and adapt in the wake of unanticipated disruptions from
cyberspace.]{.underline} [From a technical perspective, cy**ber
resilience hinges on the ability of key information and communications
systems** to anticipate and withstand disruptions to service provision

their ability to recover at or above original capacity]{.underline}.55
These same principles can be applied to the strategic level. As a
safe-to-fail strategy, cyber resilience is premised on both the failure
to deter and defend against all cyber threats and the failure to foresee
all potential strategic disruptions. The goal of cyber resilience is
thus to favorably shape the conditions of such failures by forecasting,
preparing for, and learning from strategic shocks in or through the
cyber domain that can have unanticipated, multiple-order, and spillover
effects **[NATO already possesses the strategic foundation for pursuing
greater cyber resilience]{.underline}** and has recently reiterated its
commitment to resilience writ large.56 At the 2016 Warsaw Summit, Allies
agreed to seven baseline requirements for national resilience, one of
which seeks to strengthen civil communications systems. This requirement
was updated in November 2019 to reflect considerations for 5G.57 [The
Cyber Defense Pledge offers a more specific platform for linking
national capability development to allied resilience. It emphasizes the
need for greater **resources**, more domestic stakeholder interaction
and **information sharing**, and better cyber hygiene and
**education**]{.underline}.58 **[However]{.underline}**, [these
initiatives have both been couched in the self-help]{.underline}
principle of Article 3 of the North Atlantic Charter, whereby Allies
work towards greater resilience "separately and jointly, by means of
continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid."59 [As such, Allies
pursue cyber resilience relatively independently]{.underline}. For
example, the Cyber Section of NATO's Emerging Security Challenges
Division (ESCD) conducts a regular survey of all member states for the
Cyber Defense Pledge, but [national responses are voluntary]{.underline}
and Allies must individually request information from previous surveys.
[Yet, fully incorporating safe-to-fail principles into the Alliance
necessitates viewing resilience outside of the Article 3 context as a
necessarily shared effort among member states.]{.underline} The
limitations of collective defense discussed in this chapter highlight
the potential for cyber operations to produce unanticipated,
cross-boundary effects. [Allied resiliency is inextricably
interdependent---the digital interconnectedness of allied economic and
defense efforts means that the vulnerabilities of one ally become
vulnerabilities for all]{.underline}. Entanglement with the private
sector is also an important confounding factor for members' self-help
efforts. NATO and its members will continue to rely on the private
sector and civilian infrastructure for mission-critical systems and new
technologies. The speed and spillover of disruptive cyber incidents like
the WannaCry ransomware and the NotPetya
wiperware-disguised-as-ransomware speak to the insufficiency of relying
only on self-help measures to build cyber resilience.60 Resilience
through selfhelp is therefore only part of the puzzle; **[safe-to-fail
policies require more formalized coordination across
NATO.]{.underline}** [Such efforts can leverage consultation mechanisms
and processes derived from Article 4 of the North Atlantic
Treaty,]{.underline}61 and Article 2 provides a powerful basis for
members to coordinate with the private sector and deconflict economic
policies underlying cyber resilience.62 This shared resilience must also
be projected forward outside the bounds of the Alliance to NATO's
partners. The same cyber threat dynamics that make resilience a shared
endeavor among members also highlight the importance of developments in
partner and other third-party states (on partnerships, see Elgin and
Wieslander in this volume). Unlike in traditional domains, NATO's
resilience and collective defense in the cyber domain are directly
affected by the resiliency of non-members. Ukraine serves as a key
example, as the country has been a testbed for Russian cyber operations
with international implications. For instance, the BlackEnergy Trojan
malware deployed against the Ukrainian power grid in 2015 was later
found on US power grid networks.63 In the case of the 2017 cyberattacks
on Ukraine, the NotPetya malware self-replicated and spread rapidly and
destructively to over 150 countries using the Windows-based exploits.64
[These incidents show the tenuous nature of cyber resilience and the
need for the Alliance to aid partners in modernizing and building
resilient digital infrastructures]{.underline}. [Article 10 of the
Treaty already lays the foundation for projecting resilience forward to
aspiring members65 and can be used to set cyber resilience requirements
alongside more traditional standards]{.underline}. Forward cyber
resilience is in NATO's best interests: the Alliance will be more
resilient if its neighbors and partners are more resilient.
Operationalizing shared and forward cyber resilience as a safe-to-fail
strategy will require four main lines of effort.66 First, critical cyber
assets, functions, personnel, and intersections and dependencies, must
be identified and prioritized. Prioritization hinges on determining the
relative exposure and significance of assets, how they may be targeted
and attacked, and the areas where greater risks can be assumed. Second
and related is risk minimization, particularly in terms of supply
chains. One issue that has risen in prominence is the use of 5G
infrastructures and networks. For instance, relying on non-allied
suppliers of military or other vital communications infrastructures,
such as Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, can entail increased
vulnerabilities for the Alliance.67 Other important aspects of risk
minimization include continuous threat monitoring and the development of
continuity-of-operations plans for cyber crises. Continuity plans are
particularly crucial for ensuring that adversaries gain fewer and
shorter-term payoffs from disruptions like ransomware attacks or
sophisticated wiper worms that delete information. Third, foresight and
long-term trend analysis are critical for cyber resilience, as strategic
and technological change will further complicate an already complex
operational environment. Threat actors will continue to develop new
doctrines, institutions, and capabilities for the cyber domain. Emerging
technologies, such as quantum computing, and the increased use of
artificial intelligence will undoubtedly impact the scope, nature, and
disruptive potential of cyber threats to the Alliance and its members.68
In this vein, NATO's proposed establishment of a defense innovation
accelerator is an important forward-looking development.69 Fourth,
effective cyber resilience requires not only bouncing back to normal
from disruptions, but also bounding forward via adaptation and the
institutionalization of 'lessons learned.' Each of these lines of
efforts will require institutionalized cooperation among member states
and between NATO and its partner countries. Shared and forward cyber
resilience complements collective defense by addressing a range of grey
zone threats to which fail-deadly and fail-safe logics do not apply. At
the same time, [the safe-to-fail logic of resilience can strengthen the
Alliance's ability to carry out its other core tasks. Resilience makes
collective defense more credible, as the continuity of critical
functions and services are crucial for reducing the benefits of
disruption for adversaries.]{.underline} For instance, [implementing a
safe-to-fail strategy helps to reduce the impact of defensive capability
gaps between allies in the cyber domain.]{.underline} [Resilience
efforts also support collective defense by overlapping with
deterrence-by-denial measures]{.underline}.70 Moreover, and particularly
in terms of crisis management, cyber resilience can support efforts in
traditional domains by ensuring that NATO and Allied land, sea, and air
components dependent upon cyberspace can continue to operate with
minimal disruption. **[Projecting cyber resilience forward to NATO's
partner countries also provides an avenue from which to strengthen the
Alliance's cooperative security engagements]{.underline}**. [Finally,
the future-oriented and adaptive nature of resilience provides an
important foundation for collective defense, crisis management, and
cooperative security in the cyber domain to evolve with the emergence of
new technologies and threats as the Alliance heads into the next decade
and beyond.]{.underline}

[The United States should invest more capabilities and training in
cybersecurity threat mitigation]{.underline}. [Russia's cyber
capabilities have evolved to become increasingly
sophisticated]{.underline} and far-reaching. [The United States, and
other Western allies, are not immune to cyberattacks]{.underline} ---
rather, **[Western countries are quickly becoming prime
targets]{.underline}** for Russian cyber operations. The 2020 SolarWinds
hack, attributed to Russia, infiltrated more than 250 U.S. federal
agencies as well as hundreds of U.S. companies.1¶ The 2018 U.S. cyber
strategy opened the door for the United States to pursue offensive cyber
capabilities.2 U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) should fully explore and
carefully deploy these capabilities to deter future cyberattacks by
Russia.¶ **[In the longer term, the United States and Europe will need
to work together to develop a cyber deterrence strategy]{.underline}**
[vis-à-vis Russia and other state actors that seek to use cyber tools to
attack critical infrastructure systems, steal sensitive national
security data, and breach intellectual property rights]{.underline}.
[Such a strategy should set out clear parameters for engaging with
adversarial states in the cyber domain]{.underline}, which should
include an elaborate response framework that works to de-escalate
confrontation between cyber superpowers.¶ COGNITIVE RESILIENCE¶ The
fight against information manipulation --- Russian or otherwise ---
starts at school and must continue through all demographics. It is of
the utmost importance to offer future generations of information
consumers the proper tools to decipher the informational environment.
Comprehensive media literacy education is indispensable for a long-term
defense against norm destabilization and disinformation. It provides a
safety net as media practices evolve and should be woven into national
curricula from an early stage.¶ In this regard, there are lessons that
Western countries can learn from frontline states, such as Ukraine and
Estonia, that have been targets of Russian information warfare for
decades. Developing a critical lens for misleading or manipulative
information as part of a broader civics education should be a priority
in secondary education curricula.¶ 2. UNITY OF ENDEAVOR¶ REASSESS THE
NATURE OF THE 'RUSSIA CHALLENGE'¶ After the end of the Cold War and the
West's declaration of "victory" over the Soviet Union, Russia studies
were quickly relegated to an unwanted dark art. Meanwhile, Russian
military planners never stopped red teaming the West.¶ It is time to pay
more attention to Russia studies. There is an urgent need for a better
policy understanding of the evolution of Russian strategic thinking and
its tactical applications. The U.S. government should increase support
to public institutions, agencies, research centers, and think tanks
working on Russia studies. This must be done by taking into
consideration the diversity of national approaches to Russia, and the
need to better coordinate expertise and policy in the United States and
beyond.¶ Through more coordinated and calibrated policy, the goal should
be to achieve a sense of unity in the West as regards the nature of the
"Russia challenge." This could be achieved in the United States through
increased engagement with European partners, fostered by the Biden
administration. While it may be hard to achieve a common understanding,
greater policy coherence with Western partners should be pursued.¶ In
parallel, it is vital that the new U.S. administration does not relegate
Russia affairs to the back burner or deprioritize them. The "Russia
challenge" is here to stay and should not be overlooked as a consequence
of the overarching necessity to address all things China.¶ COOPERATION
AND SUPPORT FOR ALLIES¶ [The United States cannot push back against
Russia alone. It should spearhead more comprehensive links with partners
and allies in order to calibrate not only policies but also
effects.]{.underline}¶ [Sharing best practices is critical in that
regard, **alongside increased coordination and support** in countries
targeted by Russian hybrid warfare]{.underline}. [This could take the
form of increased intelligence sharing, return of experience, and
lessons learned from successfully pushing back against Russian hybrid
attacks, as well as specific cooperation programs between NATO
allies]{.underline} **[--- an effort the United States could
lead.]{.underline}**

**allow NATO a key role in taking on the China** challenge in ways that

NATO in straddling the chasm between member states prioritizing threats
from either China, Russia, the Middle East, or North Africa, since cyber
and space threats potentially stem from all of them]{.underline}, and
the effectiveness of cyber and space defense mechanisms do not
necessarily depend on geographical origin. Cyber and space would allow
NATO a key role in the China challenge without prioritizing China
Improved communication between NATO and the EU will be essential for
NATO to successfully address the military aspects of cyber and space
threats. The framework for permanent EU-NATO relations, Berlin Plus, was
concluded in March 2003. It allows for the exchange of classified
information, the EU's use of NATO assets and capabilities for EU-led
crisis management operations, and the establishment of consultation
arrangements.31 Due to disagreements over responsibilities and
jurisdiction, however, meaningful coordination did not take place until
July 2016. On this occasion, NATO and the EU issued a joint declaration
stating their intention to work together on security and defense
responses to unprecedented challenges emanating from the South and East
of the Euro-Atlantic area.32 During Biden's visit to Brussels in June
2021, NATO promised to strengthen cooperation with the EU on promoting
peace and stability including protecting critical infrastructure,
strengthening resilience, maintaining a technological edge, and
addressing challenges to a rules-based order.33 The EU-US summit
statement from the same visit merely reaffirms support for robust
NATO-EU cooperation and promises to strengthen the partnership.34 At the
level of policy implementation, it is clear when talking to NATO and EU
officials that usually they do not coordinate their strategies and
tactics for countering China challenges.35 The EU-US summit statement's
negligible mention of cooperation with NATO indicates that the ball is
in NATO's court if strengthening NATO-EU coordination is to take place.
French and German concerns about entrapment are a major barrier to
meaningful NATO-EU cooperation. The area of cyber and space security may
allow NATO to work around this roadblock. In line with the EU's practice
of supporting the efforts of groups of member states to take the lead on
issues where EU institutions cannot trump sovereignty, in the area of
cybersecurity the EU has decentralized implementation to work around
national resistance. This has allowed the EU to respond collectively and
effectively to cyberattacks in Europe, primarily through bolstering
capacities and law enforcement cooperation.36 However, the EU is not yet
a globally influential and effective cyber-power because differences
among member states over issues such as whether to prioritize tech
sovereignty or Europe's global tech competitiveness prevent the EU from
acting in unison on the global stage. The first US-EU TTC meeting held
in September 2021 was an important step in strengthening the EU's global
position in cooperation with the United States, and hence called into
question whether NATO has a role to play in cyber security.37 The next
couple of years will demonstrate whether the EU and the US are able to
focus on becoming mutually supportive global cyber security guardians by
cooperating on strengthening investment screening, export controls, and
rebalance global supply chains in semiconductors. The successful
implementation on both sides of the Atlantic of the recommendations of
the TTC working groups will determine if transatlantic cooperation
positions the US and the EU as global partners in guarding cyber space.
In part, this will depend on the EU's ability to forge common positions
that meet the US halfway on issues such as tech sovereignty and data
privacy, points of contention through which transatlantic relations have
been marred by conflict. The potential [convergence of transatlantic
views on cybersecurity leaves room for **NATO**]{.underline} [to play a
significant role because the EU is a civilian and economic, rather than
military, set of institutions]{.underline}. The NATO summit in Brussels
in 2018 carved out a role for NATO which the EU cannot fulfill, allowing
NATO members to integrate their sovereign cyber capabilities into NATO
operations and missions.38 However, compared to the EU's major role in
cyber, NATO's role is negligible. As EU civil-military cooperation ramps
up in enhancing Europe's autonomous defense profile while allowing US
companies a role in this effort, the union looks set to become an even
more dominant actor in transatlantic cyber defense. [Because NATO is a
military organization, it has the procedures and instruments to
**position** itself in a **key** **role**]{.underline} [in coordinating
and implementing]{.underline} **[the military aspects of cyber defense
between the US and Europe]{.underline}**. The multinational
cybersecurity effort which is confronting the global threat posed by
Chinese state-sponsored cyberattacks involves NATO, the EU, Australia,
New Zealand, and Japan, and sets NATO off to a good start in enhancing
its profile in countering Chinese challenges to transatlantic
cybersecurity.39 However, it remains to be seen if it manages to deliver
mechanisms that succeed in integrating allied responses in the military
sector in a way that complements US and EU cyber defense initiatives. In
outer space, the EU is also increasingly active, recognizing the need to
deepen investments in areas such as satellite navigation, earth
observation, space situational awareness, and secure communications,
which are all central to enhanced space security. The EU has established
the EU Agency for the Space Programme, which has oversight over
everything the EU does in orbit as a bloc. Moreover, the EU uses the
European Space Agency (ESA) as technical advisor and industrial
procurement agent. This setup allows the EU to become more agile,
dynamic, and innovative in space as rapid industrialization is taking
place with US entrepreneurs and well-funded Chinese space programs in
leading roles.40 In the pipeline are a next generation of Europe's
satellite-navigation system, Galileo, and an extension of the scope and
capabilities of its Copernicus-Sentinel spacecraft, which monitors the
state of the planet. The EU focuses on ensuring that Europe has
independent space capabilities, but it does not develop instruments such
as space weapons systems.41 In the outer space realm, NATO has
tremendous potential for playing a key role in developing instruments in
the military sector that involve European and US space capabilities.
NATO's decision to declare outer space an operational domain at the
London summit in 2019 is a first step in allowing NATO an active role in
addressing growing anti-satellite threats from China and Russia.42 With
the US as the leading power in outer space and with the EU developing
its space platforms to enhance situational awareness and security, NATO
has the tools to work out a common transatlantic definition of the
anti-satellite challenges that need to be addressed. The establishment
of [mechanisms that ensure coordination across **military NATO
commands**]{.underline} [regarding intelligence gathering]{.underline}
and the interface between cyber and space defense, as well as civilian
and military occurrences and initiatives, [would potentially strengthen
the ability of allies to **counter anti-satellite threats
considerably**]{.underline}. As with cyber, NATO must first integrate
the space issue into all its organizational and operational structures,
and secondly, develop mechanisms that focus on coordination between US
and European capacities on the basis of a common understanding of the
challenges to be addressed. NATO has the tools to work out a common
transatlantic definition of anti-satellite challenges NATO's Role in the
Global Commons NATO can only be as effective as its member states allow
it to be. NATO reflects the state of transatlantic relations: are US and
European security outlooks sufficiently compatible such that the
alliance is able to address threats from China collectively? This
question is reflected in how well they manage to define common
challenges and establish mechanisms that allow them to address these
challenges together. NATO was a natural center of security focus for
Washington when Europe was the main arena for US-Soviet deterrence.
Today, the Indo-Pacific competes for US attention and resources as
competition with China has moved to the center stage of US security and
defense priorities. The strategic shift in US priorities does not mean
that Europe cannot continue to remain a significant influence on global
security dynamics. The EU has demonstrated its continued relevance in
the security realm, not merely by relying on its role as a major trade
bloc, but also by reforming the interplay between member states and EU
institutions to avoid being paralyzed by consensus requirements, which
apply in most areas outside the trade sector. This is done by providing
platforms for member states to start initiatives. If successful in
attracting support within the union, the initiatives are consolidated by
supportive mechanisms and programs.43 NATO is not the EU and hence
should not duplicate its methods. The EU is driven by the urge to secure
the continued influence of its member states on major global issues.
NATO's raison d'être is to facilitate transatlantic cooperation in the
military sector to counter common threats and challenges. Coordination
is complex at a time when US and European security outlooks are drifting
apart in terms of threat perceptions and priorities. At the same time,
fears of entrapment stifle NATO's efforts to update its relevance,
principally because key members such as France and Germany are not
interested in NATO taking on China as a threat. Nevertheless, [NATO's
agreement to define China as a challenge promises opportunities for
positioning the alliance in a key role in transatlantic relations.
Because cyber and space encompass threats from other adversaries such as
Russia and Iran, these domains are]{.underline} a [good place to start
taking on China as they do not require that China be singled out as a
threat. By taking on the responsibility for]{.underline} **[coordinating
US and European definitions of cyber]{.underline}** and outer space
**[threats in the military sector]{.underline}**, **[integrating these
domains]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} all organizational and
operational **[NATO structures]{.underline}**, devising mechanisms for
the member states to address cyber and outer space threats,
[and]{.underline} by **[facilitating intelligence exchange and
management]{.underline}** of the vulnerabilities produced by
civil-military interaction and overlapping interfaces between the cyber
and space sectors, **[NATO can demonstrate its continued relevance for
transatlantic security in an era where threats are increasingly global
and transcend geographical boundaries]{.underline}**. There's no time
like the present.

#### Expanding authority for security cooperation with NATO, specifically sharing intel and OCO capabilities, enables effective US cyberposture and restores NATO cohesion

Stuttgart, Germany; The Civil Affairs Association, "The Rhetoric vs the
Reality: Understanding NATO's Capacity to Address Russian Gray-zone
Conflict," Eunomia Journal\]

Despite these challenges, the NATO toolbox does include a variety of
instruments, such as the imposition of sanctions. And while the Alliance
has made clear it neither limits punishment to similar cyber-attacks nor
excludes them, it keeps the option open to use the full range of Allied
capabilities to deter and counter gray-zone actions. At the 2018
Brussels Summit, [Allies expressed their determination "to employ the
full range of capabilities, including cyber]{.underline}, to deter,
defend against, and [to counter the full spectrum of cyber
threats]{.underline}, including those conducted as part of a hybrid
campaign."\[33\] Thus, [NATO could retaliate in a proportional manner,
but it does not necessarily have to do so by granting the authority to
mirror Russian activity]{.underline}, [especially considering Russia
employs tactics that violate the norms of the liberal international
order]{.underline}. Corruption, illicit finance, elections in­terference,
debt traps, the restriction of free speech, spreading false narratives,
territorial aggression, and ex­tra-legal operations are all areas NATO
may rightfully choose to not engage. From a technical standpoint,
[should an adversary proliferate computer viruses to shut down power
grids,]{.underline} [countering with a cyber-attack may not
stop]{.underline}/prevent [the attacker's imminent capacity to
reengage.]{.underline} Despite an open-ended potential for graduated
response options, [[NATO policy on gray-zone activities, particularly in
cyber]{.mark} and information [remain]{.mark} wholly constructed around
a **[defensive]{.mark} posture**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, [defensive
actions do not adequately address either the safeguarding of personal
data that Russian or other malign actors might use in cyber-enabled
information warfare or the economic incentives that drive users toward
such behavior. **Considering US cyber capacity**]{.underline},
**[DoD's]{.underline}** stepped-up [current posture of "persistent
engagement" bodes well]{.underline} [for active cyber
defense]{.underline}.\[34\] However, questions remain as to whether it
effectively enables operations to be deployed fast enough to address the
ever-changing threat profiles and to manage escalation potential.
Moreover, [the approach requires the tight coupling of strategic
ends]{.underline}---typically identified in an interagency policy
process---[and operational effects]{.underline}. It remains unclear if
the current NATO collective defense strategy is able to deliver that
coupling for US capabilities, which can create risks of unintended
escalation or self-defeating effects not understood by well-meaning
policymakers. Finally, significant gaps remain in intelligence and
warning for cyber incidents across NATO, as well as normative frameworks
to guide responsible use.\[35\] Some efforts to resolve gray-zone
conflict remain in their infancy. For example, in 2016, Finland
instituted the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid
Threats in Helsinki with participation open to EU member states and
NATO.\[36\] However, the Hybrid CoE provides only an analytical
framework for the assessment of current and future hybrid warfare
situations and their practical implication. The development of the
Hybrid CoE is a model that could be applied in other regions for
building capacity, and interoperability, and its existence is an
important step forward for EU and NATO members to informally address
vulnerabilities. However, this effort holds no authority or capacity to
engage a response. Holistically, despite a number of declarations,
increased force presence in Eastern Europe, and newly formed
information-sharing centers, NATO's actions remain pursuant to
conventional forms of military deterrence or research. None specifically
counter gray-zone activity or prevent Russia from targeting weaker
nations. From a military deterrence standpoint, there clearly appears to
be a functional mismatch between NATO's traditional hard deterrence and
the hybrid actions it wishes to remedy. Integrating multiple elements of
national security remains unaddressed. Authorities [[One of the key
challenges]{.mark} often [plaguing US and NATO response to gray-zone
conflict is "authorities]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark} This problem is
two-fold. The first are the challenges [[internal to the
US]{.underline}]{.mark} regarding perceived inadequate or dispersed
authorities to effectuate coherent activity. The second are insufficient
authorities inside the NATO Alliance -- partly a function of the
political bureaucracy within NATO itself, arguably slow to elicit timely
and relevant responses. Much of the literature on countering gray-zone
activity recognizes the need for an interdependent system.\[37\] Critics
have additionally pointed to several issues which include the lack of a
holistic methodology for dealing with Russia's gray-zone behavior.\[38\]
But without a formalized methodology for defining and assigning policy
priorities and actions, effective long-term strategies for deterring,
competing against, and responding to competitors' use of
state-controlled forces will likely be limited. Limitations precluding a
real-time, multi-agency approach to address adversarial actions are
especially salient in the information and cyber domains. Within the US
government, responsibilities and authorities are spread across numerous
entities, to include DoD, DoS, and Treasury. There is no unity of effort
and no specific organization has lead for synchronizing the employment
of all instruments of national power.\[39\] Within DoD, most of the
capabilities reside inside the force structure of geographic and
functional combatant commands (CCMD) and are tasked through unified
combatant command (COCOM) au­thority. Authorities quickly cut across both
functional and geographic lines. This may slow defining roles and
responsibilities. Also, several offensive capabilities are either
compartmentalized due to the technology behind them or, considering
their effect, may yield undesirable strategic impact. Therefore,
authorities for their use -- specifically in the information and cyber
domains are often retained at the SECDEFs level (or above). This can
dramatically impact the speed of response. To fix this, some authorities
(and associated risk acceptance) might be delegated down to Ambassador
level, such that in a steady-state environment, permission might be
granted to create effects in the information environment, while
retaining country-team level and multi-agency awareness. [Additional
[challenges with authority are a result of ambiguity in US law. Both
Title 10 and]{.mark} Title [22 authorities grant DoD]{.mark} and DoS
[authorities to support, train, and partner with
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}, with legal checks and controls on human
rights and ac­countability measures. However, **[[there is no clear
de­lineation over whether building]{.mark}/countering [US local partners
should be under Title 10 or]{.mark} Title [50]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Central Intelligence Agency) authorities. As a result, the question of
who owns long-term proxy strategy and operational development remains
unanswered in the US interagency.\[40\] [This "authorities dilemma" is
even more **convoluted** within the **NATO**]{.underline}
[alliance]{.underline}. The United States' aspirational model for
countering Russia's gray-zone activity via whole-of-government approach,
is not well-suited for a multinational security-based alliance.
Opportunities and Recommendations There are several observably difficult
challenges in how the US and NATO approach gray-zone competition, as a
military, as individual nations, and as Allies. Such challenges do come
with opportunities. The Department of Defense cannot abruptly
restructure itself to engage in all gray-zone activities, nor should it
necessarily want to. What the Alliance does have however, includes
asymmetric advantages of transparency through its rule of law. [The
system of alliances and partners can work to extend]{.underline}
democratic principles, acknowledge humanitarian concerns, [prevent
violent conflict, identify and stymie political and economic
ex­ploitation]{.underline}, and support free and fair media
outlets.\[41\] Thus, developing methods that directly compete in the
gray-zone can exist outside the development of like-capabilities.
Likewise, NATO cannot immediately establish a multi-agency organization,
built to compete across a spectrum of gray-zone activities, empowered to
lead, synchronize, and coordinate diverse capabilities across the
conflict continuum.\[42\] Authorities still must be reconfigured down
and across to appropriate levels to enable proportionality, when
directed. [The good news for US DoD is that it may not have to embark on
a complicated restructuring in order to counter Russia's malign
actions]{.underline}. [[DoD's current approach places war-fighting
authorities under CCMDs]{.underline}.]{.mark} There are certainly
numerous challenges in synchronizing prior­ities, resources, and actions
to leverage a broad toolset and eliminate the stovepipes. Indeed,
[[specific capabilities such as information]{.mark} warfare, or
**[offensive cyber]{.mark}**, are **neither** geographically nor
functionally lim­ited]{.underline}.\[43\] Yet while true, just because
some gray-zone actions cross geographical and functional lines, this
does not inherently mean the response is hindered. While broad oversight
may be an enabler, lack of it is not an inhibitor and it does not mean
that a Combatant Command is disabled. In fact, [Russia's activities
[are]{.mark} often geographically focused]{.underline} --- making them
[[ripe for inclusion]{.underline}]{.mark} into CCMD Campaign Plans.
Under the current structure, the geographic [Combatant Commands
are]{.underline} arguably [best postured to compete against Russia's
gray-zone activities, taking full]{.underline} [advantage of supporting
the coordinated activities of USCYBERCOM as well as the expertise of US
SOCOM.]{.underline} **[[Specific authorities could be
granted]{.underline}]{.mark}** now for implementation **[[by US forces
in support of NATO objectives]{.underline}]{.mark}** to reduce Russia's
information position, [[as well as **granting authorities** for the
**leveraging of the information environment to the benefit of both US
and NATO strategic interests**.]{.mark}]{.underline} While a US
whole-of-government approach with a singular lead organization is a
lofty ideal, this is simply not practical in the short term. [There are
actions that can be taken to establish a unified purpose, and to ensure
that reform priorities for competing in the gray-zone are formed around
making the most of available US strengths by mitigating current gaps in
the ability to execute national interest-based strategy via campaign
plans. If [NATO]{.mark} is to deal effectively with such competition,
then it too [must refocus]{.mark} its own military strategy and forces
[to give gray-zone and hybrid conflicts]{.mark} at least equal standing
with traditional deterrence.]{.underline} At present, NATO has only
recognized cyberspace as a domain of operations since 2016. While an
important first step in combating gray-zone activities in the
information domain, the information centers standing up are limited to
situational awareness, along with some planning and coordination
tools.\[44\][The Alliance has yet to refocus its security strategy to
address the impact of gray-zone activity across global, regional, and
national levels. Delegated [authorities]{.mark} and packaged measures
[will need to be **tailored**]{.mark} and based on a better
understanding of the strategic intent behind the use of gray-zone tools.
This can help the military better engage in the debate and develop
capabilities to support Allies in **countering non-military
threats**]{.underline}, such as using special operations, information,
and psychological operations. A focused approach with delegated
authority would vastly improve NATO's efficiency in influencing the
cost-benefit analysis of potential aggressors in what has now become the
modern theatre of operations. In short[, if opponents increasingly act
in the gray area, NATO must be efficiently enabled to defend, attribute,
and respond]{.underline}. The initial structure is in place, but the
operationalization of strategy and authority for appropriate
comprehensive tools lags. Defeating Russia's sophisticated strategy
requires strategic competence and a concerted effort to restore
confidence in democratic principles, institutions, and processes, along
with remediating the vulnerabilities Russia exploits. To compete
properly, NATO must articulate clear guidance for its threshold warfare
deterrence posture, with options that realistically allow forces to
respond to Russian gray-zone behavior. [Management of these threats must
be an ongoing endeavor, [requiring a change in mindset]{.mark} from the
deliberate sequential planning processes associated with classic forms
of conflict to a more dynamic approach of continuously updated
situational awareness, driving political discussion, option development,
decision-making, and measured response under political
control.]{.underline} To do this effectively, [**[NATO]{.underline}**
[will have to progress from crisis-response
operations]{.underline}]{.mark} [to reinvigorate both its military
strategy and forces and ensure gray-zone and hybrid conflicts are
prioritized along with higher levels of warfare]{.underline}. This may
include refocusing its current security strategy to address the overall
impact of Russian civil competition at all levels by fully integrating
its military, political, and economic strategies and operations. How
much of (and when) technological capacity should be delegated down must
ultimately be considered and reviewed, along with how NATO integrates
response capabilities into the multi-national environment. These gaps
must be bridged to enable multinational teaming. Without them, NATO's
plans for deterrence, defense, and dialogue run the risk of becoming
reactive, or even outmaneuvered. Many gray-zone operations will not
require the actual use of military force. Some will be entirely civil or
economic -- using non-military means to achieve strategic or tactical
objectives. This will inevitably require 'whole-of-government' capacity
within NATO structures in a way that NATO is presently not organized or
enabled to perform. [If NATO members agree that the trend of cyberspace
is the most active battlefield, then it is crucial the Alliance has a
threat preparation and mitigation plan that is continuously monitored,
assessed, and adjusted, with deterrence mechanisms
built-in.]{.underline} Presently they are not. The significance to NATO
is clear. **[NATO must overhaul its deterrence strategy]{.underline}**,
to include options far more nuanced than tactical overmatch, by
re-evaluating the role of its military as a deterrent, through increased
sub-Article 5 capacities. This might even include support from the
private sector and international organizations, with emphasis on a
comprehensive approach. Conclusion Since its inception,
**[NATO]{.underline}** [has been more than just a military alliance. It
has embraced a political role, unifying Allies behind a common strategic
vision]{.underline}. Future uncertainties demand NATO must continue to
adapt. Given the significant changes in the security environment since
Russia's incursion into Georgia and Crimea, this presents an opportunity
to determine the character of the Alliance's military capabilities
vis-à-vis gray-zone warfare. Future decades will certainly be different
than the world the Alliance inhabited during the Cold War. [**[NATO's
cohesion]{.underline}** [resides in the ability]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and will [to act]{.mark} collectively [against shared
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[This is the lifeblood that ensures
the]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[vitality, [credibility, and durability of
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It becomes increasingly important in a
sharpened competitive environment requiring collaboration and effective
networks. Therefore, the distinctive capabilities required to counter
gray-zone warfare must be seriously contemplated.

### NATO Vulnerable Now

#### NATO is at risk for cyber-attacks- autonomous devices vulnerable and easy to manipulate

[Autonomous devices]{.underline} and systems [are]{.underline} platforms
and [devices that can achieve their goals independently]{.underline} and
require little or external control and supervision. [They
combine]{.underline} intelligent [software which]{.underline}, thanks to
AI-enabled autonomy, conducts or [assists with decision-making via
hardware devices]{.underline} which interact with the system's
surroundings and the physical world to collect data and undertake tasks
(Scharre, 2018; Vallor and Bekey, 2017). 92 Autonomous systems can vary
in size, hardware and level of autonomy. The level of autonomy is
typically classified according to the expected 'meaningful human
control', which is a metric reflecting the extent to which humans are
required to intervene in a system's interactions with the real world
(Scharre, 2018; Fong, 2019; Leikas et al., 2019). [A wide array
of]{.underline} [autonomous systems with direct relevance to security
and defence have been developed in recent years]{.underline}, including
autonomous unmanned vehicles, unmanned weapons systems and smart medical
devices. Further advances in this field are expected to stem from
developments in swarming technologies2 and of more sophisticated
autonomous systems, including for autonomous weapons. [These advances
are expected to reduce reliance on humans]{.underline} for
decision-making or operational control[, thus opening vulnerabilities
for the possible disruption and manipulation]{.underline} of autonomous
systems. [From a cyber threat perspective]{.underline}, [the
proliferation of autonomous systems and devices is expected to increase
the attack surface available to adversaries and malicious
actors]{.underline} (Bogan & Feeney, 2020). For example, [autonomous
weapons systems that include a tether]{.underline}, enabling the remote
control of a system from a supplying country wishing to ensure
compliance of the use of its systems with international humanitarian
law, [could result in the embedding of back doors and kill switches
limiting the value of autonomous system assets and
potentially]{.underline} [making them vulnerable to]{.underline}
disruption or [manipulation by]{.underline} other [third
parties]{.underline} (Kajander et al., 2020). Similarly, the use of
autonomous vehicles for logistics could be targeted by adversaries
leveraging cyber vulnerabilities or adversarial AI to disrupt the
logistics and supply chains of a military operation (Danks, 2020; Bogan
& Feeney, 2020).

#### NATO is high for cyber stacks- changing to computing power that are easily manipulated

[Computing power and data storage technologies are]{.underline}
fundamental enablers [of ICT systems.]{.underline} Along with sensors,
[these technologies allow the capture, manipulation and storage of
data]{.underline}. [Advances]{.underline} in these fields [have led
to]{.underline} the development of [sophisticated capabilities able to
record, store and manipulate expanding datasets at increasing
speed.]{.underline} Over the next few years, advances for computing
technologies are expected to lead to increasing miniaturisation and
greater power, enabling a variety of new solutions such as miniaturised
supercomputers, semiconductors and microprocessors like 'smart dust'
(Shaikh et al., 2016; Beijing Innovation Centre for Future Chips, 2018).
With regard to data storage, in addition to the development of
high-density low-energy consumption data storage solutions, it is
expected that the future will see a continuation of the growing use and
reliance of cloud storage technologies, enabling ubiquitous, on-demand
access to data through remote servers (Hess et al., 2019). These trends
and their effects are expected to be further reinforced by advances 2
The development of advanced collective behaviour mechanisms that enable
two or more autonomous systems to operate collectively. 93 in the fields
of sensors. Sensors are used on IT-enabled systems to acquire data to
contribute to the performing of different tasks, including
decisionmaking and the tracking and monitoring of a variety of different
phenomena. [Advances]{.underline} in sensors [are expected to result in
improved performance and accuracy]{.underline}, further miniaturisation3
[and improved ability to record]{.underline} or generate new types of
[data]{.underline}. From a defence standpoint, modern platforms and
systems have already witnessed the embedding of an increasing number and
type of networked sensors which monitor and support their performance.
In the coming decade, sensors could also see a growing integration at
the level of individual soldiers or systems to improve communications,
situational awareness and enable more robust decision-making at
different levels through data fusion and analysis (Kepe et al., 2018).
These trends are expected to be further reinforced thanks to advances in
telecommunications infrastructure. Telecommunications technologies
comprise all the physical and digital infrastructure that enables
information to flow across the internet and between devices and systems.
The global telecommunication infrastructure is expected to continue
evolving rapidly and already encompasses a wide range of technologies
including Wi-Fi, optical fibre, light-fidelity and fifth-generation
mobile networks (5G) (Deloitte, 2017; ENISA, 2019). Advances in
telecommunications technologies in the next years are expected to
increase bandwidth, decrease latency and increase spectral efficiency,
leading to greater connectivity and a more digitalised world[. The
coming decade is likely to see a continuation of the shift from offline
to online]{.underline}, with more devices, systems and services becoming
digital and connected, [including in critical infrastructure
sectors]{.underline} (Bogan & Feeney, 2020). **[This will extend to
military platforms and activities, providing for a greater impact of
cyber threats beyond the cyber domain to traditional military domains of
operations and the day-to-day functioning of military
institutions]{.underline}** (Kepe et al., 2018). Sensors, computing,
data storage and telecommunications technology are therefore expected to
play a key enabling role for trends and challenges discussed in Section
Three of this chapter.

#### NATO's cyber security is at risk-reliance on networks can be damaged by a range of people

[All members of NATO benefit]{.underline} greatly [from digital
connectivity and the]{.underline} many¶ [opportunities it provides
for]{.underline} social, economic and political
[development]{.underline}. At¶ the same time, **[it is widely recognised
that heightened dependency on digital]{.underline}**¶
**[networks]{.underline}** and systems **[is a systemic vulnerability
that can be exploited by a]{.underline}**¶ **[wide range
of]{.underline}** criminal and strategic **[actors]{.underline}**. The
community of like-minded democracies gathered under the
[NATO]{.underline} umbrella [is]{.underline} therefore [being challenged
as never before by]{.underline} diverse and dynamic [cyber
threats]{.underline}. This volume¶ looks ahead to how NATO can best
address these issues over the next decade,¶ contributing to the
conversation begun by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg¶ in June 2020.
In launching the NATO 2030 initiative, the Secretary General¶ canvassed
input from a wide range of stakeholders about how to strengthen¶ NATO
militarily and politically in a turbulent and competitive world
(Stoltenberg, 2020; NATO Science and Technology Organization, 2020).
This¶ volume engages directly with that discussion and aims to stimulate
broader¶ debate on the future operational environment from the
perspective of cyber¶ threat horizon-scanning and analysis, with
particular attention to the impact of new and emerging technologies.¶ In
the period under consideration, [NATO's technological edge will be
increasingly challenged]{.underline}. Recent work by **[NATO has
highlighted the wide range]{.underline}**¶ **[of emerging and disruptive
technologies which may negatively impact international
security]{.underline}** **[and stability]{.underline}** and the ability
to promote democratic norms¶ (NATO Science and Technology Organization,
2020). In May 2019, the Secretary General warned that [new technologies
such as artificial intelligence and]{.underline}¶ [machine learning will
render cyber threats even more pernicious]{.underline}, as well as¶
potentially altering the nature of warfare (Stoltenberg, 2019). [NATO
is]{.underline} fortunate to be already [deeply invested in]{.underline}
addressing [these issues.]{.underline} [The Cyber Defence
Pledge]{.underline} (2016), for instance, [exists]{.underline} in part
'[to ensure the Alliance keeps]{.underline}¶ [pace with the
fast-evolving cyber threat landscape']{.underline} and reasserts a
collective¶ will to tackle cyber threats extending as far back as the
1990s (NATO, 2016;¶ Burton, 2015). [This includes]{.underline}
successive Strategic [Concepts recognising the]{.underline}¶ [critical
importance of cybersecurity to NATO's missions and military
operations]{.underline}. Since 2016, NATO has bolstered its existing
outreach and engagement¶ programmes and embarked upon new ones, all
geared to improving its cybersecurity and that of its member states.¶ As
recognised by NATO, however, [more work is required to understand
the]{.underline}¶ [evolution of the cyber threat
environment]{.underline}. This was emphasised in the Strategic Foresight
Analysis of NATO Allied Command Transformation, which¶ encouraged NATO
to 'develop capacities to detect both subtle and seismic¶ changes in the
information environment and understand them on local, operational and
global levels' (NATO Allied Command Transformation, 2017:¶ p. 51). The
Cyber Defence Pledge itself aims to 'improve our understanding of cyber
threats, including the sharing of information and assessment'¶ (NATO,
2016). In this context, [Alliance political and strategic leaders
need]{.underline}¶ [to improve their understanding of cyber threat
vectors]{.underline}; actors' objectives, ¶ intent and capabilities;
[and the future cyberspace operational environment]{.underline}¶ [across
all phases and contexts. This includes peacetime
conditions]{.underline}, targeted [cyberspace operations
with]{.underline} disruptive or even [lethal impacts]{.underline}, and
kinetic¶ warfighting in conjunction with destructive cyber attacks. In
addition, cyber threat intelligence (CTI) must be comprehensible and
operationalised to¶ support strategic-political decision-making.

#### Current NATO efforts insufficient -- Lack of modernization efforts hinders NATO ability to respond to emerging fronts

At the same time, the U.S. has also maintained good reason to be
concerned about the defense efforts of most European powers, and [there
is a need for the U.S. to pressure given NATO European states to
increase the key aspects of their defense efforts that really matter. As
the country-by-country analysis later in this report also shows, many
European states have fallen short Put simply, the U.S. needs to
recognize that **NATO needs to be fixed** -- rather than
broken]{.underline} -- and Europe needs to recognize that there are no
real European alternatives to Atlantic deterrence and defense. It shows
that the U.S. and each of its NATO European allies need to focus on
making the alliance more effective. [They need to cooperate far more in
shaping NATO's real-world strategy and on actual levels of **meaningful
modernization** and cooperation.]{.underline} Moreover, they need to
focus on nation-by-nation improvements in the common capability to
deter, defend, and cooperate, rather than on burden-sharing, setting
arbitrary spending goals, and substituting good intentions for action.
[NATO needs new realities, not more rhetoric. Every nation in the
alliance needs to do more to actually implement the strategic and force
modernization goals set out in NATO's 2030 plan and to deal with what
NATO calls "emerging and disruptive technologies]{.underline}."5 The
plan shows that the creation of a well-balanced, integrated, and
interoperable mix of national forces for NATO should be a common U.S.,
European, and Canadian objective. At the same time, [the summary
analysis of individual member country's forces in this analysis shows
that such efforts need to address the military strengths and weaknesses
of each member state in very different ways]{.underline}. The NATO
alliance needs a far more nuanced country-by-country approach to force
planning based on a real net assessment, plans, and budgets. Moreover,
the conclusion to this analysis shows that NATO needs to actively review
the changing capabilities of the world's three superpowers and to
consult on the rising threat from China, rather than just focusing on
Russia, terrorism, and the out of area threats near Europe.

#### NATO needs to recognize its vulnerabilities -- Modernization in cyberspace needed to ward off Russia

[NATO must develop]{.underline} clear [NATO Priorities and National
Force Plans that Address the Major Changes Taking Place in Military
Dynamics and in Emerging and Disruptive Technologies (EDTs]{.underline})
The key to dealing with these issues is to go back to the NATO force
planning efforts from the past that attempted to address member
countries' force plans on a country-by-country basis and attempted to
develop both interoperability and goals for sustainability, training and
readiness, and modernization. Some lessons here are obvious. Such
efforts require annual updates, but they must look some five years into
the future as to plans, program, and budgets to develop credible
continuity and planning efforts. The U.S Future Years Defense Program
(FYDP) and the European five-year plans need to be properly implemented,
and these [plans must focus on the full range of military capabilities
instead of simply fixating on major force numbers and weapons
platforms]{.underline}. What is less obvious is [the need is to focus on
a future with very different military dynamics in an era of massive
technological change]{.underline}. NATO has begun to address some of
these issues, but they need to take into consideration both national
force planning as well as the reality that smaller nations and forces
will often need to depend heavily on the large powers and those with the
most advanced technological base. NATO cannot succeed here by asking
every nation to make the same effort in its spending burden. [The
alliance must deal with national, political, and economic realities. It
also faces extremely complex challenges in the form of what is almost
certainly going to be an ongoing revolution in military
affairs]{.underline}. There are issues too complex to deal with in this
analysis in any depth, but the following figures illustrate the sheer
level of change and its complexity. Figure Nine provides a brief summary
of the new military dynamics NATO must adjust to over the coming decade.
Figure Ten shows a NATO-created list of the emerging and disruptive
technologies (EDTs) that the alliance as well as each member country
must adjust to in shaping its future force plans. Figure Eleven shows a
matching list issued by the U.S. Department of Defense of EDTs, and one
that lists clearer force planning and modernization priorities. [They
make it all too clear that member states must develop a common approach
to modernization]{.underline} and joint all-domain warfare.
Interoperability and standardization have always been a clear alliance
priority, but the challenge is now far greater than in the past. To
provide advantage for the joint force in highly contested environments,
[the Department must develop wideband sensors to operate at the
intersection of cyber space, electronic warfare, radar, and
communications. Sensors must be able to counter advanced threats and can
no longer be stove-piped and single function.]{.underline} There is no
easy way to illustrate the scale of the changes in the military balance
between the three current superpowers since many are qualitative rather
than quantitative. Figure Twelve illustrates the quantitative changes in
some detail. It shows just how much smaller U.S., Russian, and Chinese
force numbers are today in many such metrics and that their current
forces bear only a limited resemblance to the forces they deployed in
1991. At the same time, the previous analysis has shown that [the
qualitative improvements in Russian forces mean that cuts in force
numbers]{.underline} in Figure Twelve [do not mean cuts in Russian
capability to threaten, pressure, or fight in a Europe where NATO
countries have made]{.underline} -- at the very least -- equal
reductions in their force numbers. Moreover, Figure Twelve shows that
[the U.S. made major force cuts after 1991, matching those of its
European partners Russia]{.underline} relied heavily on military mass
until the break-up of the FSU, but it has steadily improved its force
quality in many areas like air and missile defense since 1991. It has
remained competitive in conventional weapons modernization, and it has
aggressively modernized it nuclear forces. It [has shown its ability to
compete in gray area warfare in Libya and Ukraine, created new forward
capabilities in Syria, and returned to the Mediterranean -- as well as
steadily improved its cooperation with China in Asia and the
Pacific.]{.underline} Russia may have lost military and economic
strength because of the break-up of the FSU and the liberation of East
European states -- many of which have joined NATO. Yet,
[many]{.underline} of these [former Warsaw Pact states have failed to
modernize their forces and make them more interoperable with
NATO.]{.underline} The fact that [the expansion of NATO]{.underline} has
fundamentally changed the strategic map of Europe **[does not
mean]{.underline}** [that most of the states that have joined
NATO]{.underline} since the break-up of the FSU [do not depend on the
U.S.]{.underline} and other European states [for deterrence and
defense]{.underline}. As this analysis has shown, [rhetoric about
European defense cooperation cannot ignore the critical new
vulnerabilities in NATO's new forward areas. Russia remains a major and
growing threat.]{.underline}

#### NATO interoperability is lacking \-\-- Russia's invasion of Ukraine highlights this. 

Mikayla **Easley 3/9/2022**; Staff Writer; WEB EXCLUSIVE: Ukraine
Invasion Prompts Plea from French Official to Speed Up NATO Tech
Integration; NDIA's Business & Technology Magazine;
https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2022/3/9/nato-must-prioritize-system-interoperability-french-defense-official-says

[NATO officials for years have been preaching the need for
interoperability among member nations' weapon systems. France's top
defense official said in light of Russia's war against Ukraine, it isn't
happening fast enough.]{.underline} French Chief of Defense Gen. Thierry
Burkhard March 8 said: "The systems that are deployed within NATO
countries have to be compatible with the other systems in use within
NATO, so we need to make sure they are compatible \[and\] interoperable
in massive ways," he said. "I think we're not making progress in the
right direction in that field." [Russia's invasion of Ukraine highlights
the need to speed up NATO interoperability,]{.underline} he said. [The
ability for weapons and other military systems to communicate and share
information among NATO allies is one of the most important aspects for
the alliance's success in future fights]{.underline}, Burkhard said
during a fireside chat hosted by the Center for New American Security.
Collective interoperability is not currently the standard, he noted. For
example, [Burkhard has witnessed communication issues with the increased
deployment of the F-35 joint strike fighter into various NATO ally's air
forces.]{.underline} "The F-35 is designed as a very effective and
efficient system," he said. "[It has great qualities, but its design is
a very closed system and I think this is a mistake."]{.underline} NATO
militaries must play a decisive role in ensuring network
interoperability standards across the alliance, he added. [France is
also working to improve interoperability within its own armed
forces]{.underline} in an effort similar to the U.S. Defense
Department's joint all-domain command and control, or JADC2, [which aims
to link sensors and shooters at the tactical edge]{.underline}. France's
internal campaign to achieve interoperability is part of its Scorpion
program, which "aims at digitalizing all land forces in order to be able
to extend information very quickly and also improve \[our\] operational
pace in order to be able to impose our will on opponents," he said. A
document --- Burkhard's Strategic Vision for 2030 --- is not unlike
modernization plans made by the United States and the United Kingdom to
move away from operations against nonstate actors and prepare for
potential conflict with adversaries such as China and Russia. An
exception the U.S. and U.K. militaries' desires to shrink the size of
its land forces. [France will be focusing its attention on upgrading its
Army by the year 2030]{.underline}, he noted. This includes the
development of two new ground vehicles for the French army to replace
the service's aging vehicles and systems: the Griffon, a multi-role
armored vehicle, and the Jaguar, an armored reconnaissance and combat
vehicle. Burkhard said the ability of these vehicles and other new
capabilities to connect and share information across domains is "the
true driver" for success. [Russia's operations --- which have not gone
to Moscow's plans --- signal the true amounts of effort required for
high-intensity operations.]{.underline} ["It doesn't mean that we are
not able right now ready to engage in a high-intensity conflict, but not
with all the assets that were identified or the level of training we
\[expected\] to reach by 2030,"]{.underline} he said. ["The situation
today shows us that we need to speed up the process]{.underline} --- but
let us not lie to ourselves ... that's what the invasion of Ukraine by
the Russian army is showing negatively. [This is something that requires
a lot of effort and a lot of time,"]{.underline} he said.

#### European energy infrastructure is vulnerable now and Russia will target it- increasing cybersecurity is key

Alejandro **Romero**, Jonathan **Nelson**, 3-7-**2022**, \"Why Europe's
energy industry is vulnerable to cyber-attacks,\" ECFR,
https://ecfr.eu/article/why-europes-energy-industry-is-vulnerable-to-cyber-attacks/

**[Russia's war on Ukraine has created widespread concern that European
energy supplies and infrastructure will come under intensifying
cyber-attacks. The Putin regime,]{.underline}** which has long used such
disruptive tactics, **[may retaliate against Western economic sanctions
with cyber-warfare]{.underline}**. European states and energy companies
should reflect on the laundry list of such attacks that have occurred in
recent years to recognise and respond to the risks they face in this
area.¶ On 7 May 2021, the US Colonial Pipeline suffered a critical
ransomware cyber-attack [resulting from a single leaked
password](https://www.reuters.com/business/colonial-pipeline-ceo-tells-senate-cyber-defenses-were-compromised-ahead-hack-2021-06-08/)
-- the largest cyber-attack on infrastructure in US history. This
prompted the authorities to declare a state of emergency in 17 US states
along the east coast and in Washington, and resulted in major fuel
shortages and long queues at gas stations throughout affected sectors.
By early February 2022, a slew of subsequent
[cyber-attacks](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60250956) had struck
oil and gas facilities across Europe, disrupting the operations of
multiple oil transport and storage companies in Germany, Belgium, and
the Netherlands, and threatening production and distribution in the
sector.¶ [**Such attacks are possible due to three unique
vulnerabilities of the global energy ecosystem.**¶]{.underline} Firstly,
[this ecosystem relies on inherently complex
infrastructure]{.underline}. [Utility companies are exposed to
relatively high risks because their networks of both physical
infrastructure and cyber-infrastructure]{.underline} -- including
distributors, suppliers, storage facilities, and other assets -- [often
overlap and are spread across many countries.]{.underline}¶ Secondly,
the digital infrastructure that supports the global energy sector
operates around the clock, with virtually no downtime.¶ Thirdly, [the
vulnerability of the global energy sector is rooted in the many
motivations for attacks against it]{.underline}. As noted in a recent
assessment by the [Canadian Centre for Cyber
Security](https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/cyber-threat-bulletin-cyber-threat-canadas-electricity-sector),
these include attacks carried out by states trying to achieve
geopolitical goals, by criminals attempting to extort money from
desperate companies, and by activists seeking to publicise their agendas
or oppose particular projects.¶ **[Therefore, given the frequency with
which these structures come under attack and how vital they are to the
economy, the energy sector is a key geopolitical
battleground.]{.underline}** The vulnerabilities of Europe's digital
security and global energy interconnections could have a significant
impact on citizens' lives. The World Economic Forum
[highlighted](https://www.weforum.org/whitepapers/cyber-resilience-in-the-oil-and-gas-industry-playbook-for-boards-and-corporate-officers)
this in 2021, arguing that: "as one of the world's most sophisticated
and complex industries makes a multifaceted transition -- from analogue
to digital, from centralized to distributed and from fossil-based to
low-carbon -- managing cyber risk and preventing cyberthreats are
quickly becoming critical to company value chains."¶ The pandemic
accelerated the digitisation of the European economy and prompted a
rapid shift to distributed, hybrid working practices. The process has
dramatically expanded opportunities to attack critical energy
infrastructure. The Putin regime's war on Ukraine is one of many
conflicts to
[involve](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-technology-business-europe-russia-e791990f60841b599f664c34f58403de)
hybrid operations that include targeted cyber-attacks on critical
infrastructure in areas such as banking and internet services -- as was
particulary clear during the surge in attacks on the country that
occurred in early 2022.¶ The attack on the Colonial Pipeline showed how
various actors could exploit a single compromised password to severely
disrupt the energy infrastructure of the United States for several days.
How was this possible?¶ A [recent
report](https://info.constellaintelligence.com/energy-sector-exposure-report-2021)
by Constella Intelligence revealed just how much sensitive personal
information tied to corporate credentials is in circulation. In the last
few years, millions of records of sensitive personal and employee data
linked to the 20 largest global energy companies (by revenue) have
circulated online. Moreover, these risks reach the senior level: nearly
half of the executives of these companies were found to have suffered
exposure of their data in recent years. Each of these data breaches
could create additional vulnerabilities that various actors can
exploit.¶ **[Corporate and geopolitical risks are highly contingent on
the integrity and security of inidividuals' data.]{.underline}** Public
and private security protocols are among the most effective tools to
improve such integrity and security. However, in a rapidly evolving
digital sphere, it is difficult to create legislation suited to protect
private companies, public organisations, and individual citizens. The
**[European Union's push for cyber-resilience has been deliberate and
diligent. Yet the evolution of threats in the digital ecosystem could
outpace the EU's attempts to implement cyber-security measures across
all its member states.]{.underline}**

### Cyber Risk High Now

#### NATO must boost cybersecurity - Risks of cyberattacks on NATO high now

[Cybersecurity has become as crucial as conventional
security]{.underline}, thereby shifting the realm of the security
environment. [Rogue actors have boosted their capabilities, and the
costs of such resources owned by attackers are threatening security on
both sides of the Atlantic. NATO must put forward recommendations and
implement the securitization agenda in order to create an interconnected
approach within different sectors]{.underline}. NATO will need to
continue building the forcemultiplying functions of its cyber
capabilities, improve effective command and decision-making structures
in cyber crisis and conflicts, and enhance the interoperability between
allies and partners in cyberspace. The security challenges of today
require quick responses, necessitating flexible policy frameworks that
allow for coercive reactions from networked actors. [Cybersecurity
has]{.underline} long been part of Alliance calculus but only [recently
came at earnest to the forefront of its agenda.]{.underline} The [2007
cyber-attacks in Estonia]{.underline} [forced NATO to think more
seriously about this type of threat]{.underline}, and in 2008 NATO
developed its very first policy on cyber defense. [The cyber-attacks
fuelling the crisis in Ukraine's Crimea and Donbass regions served as a
definitive wake-up call. At its 2014 Wales Summit, NATO effectively
created a mind-set of urgency, featuring cybersecurity prominently on
top of the meeting's political agenda.]{.underline} Allies endorsed a
new cyber defense policy in Wales and approved a new action plan in line
with the evolving cyber threat. Thinking more creatively about the
implementation of collective security in the digital context on top of
the agenda for NATO. NATO made more significant steps in cybersecurity
at the 2016 Summit in Poland. In Warsaw, Allies decided to
operationalize cyberspace as a domain of NATO defense policy and
planning efforts, in addition to land, sea, and air. An important
product of the Warsaw Summit was the so-called NATO Cyber Defense Pledge
through which member states committed to prioritize the strengthening
the cyber defense of national networks and infrastructures. Most member
states have created national cyber defense strategies, or are reviewing
their existing ones. The concrete result of these policy shifts is a
growing number of workshops, trainings, and exercises to boost the
experience, resilience, and capabilities of Allies in cyberspace. A
remarkable effort in this light is exercise Locked Shields, the world's
largest and most advanced international technical live-fire cyber
defense exercise, which is hosted annually by the NATO Cooperative Cyber
Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCoE) in Tallinn, Estonia. Locked
Shields challenges cybersecurity experts from NATO member states,
partner countries, and industry with scenario-based, real-time
cyber-attacks enabling the participants to practice defending
information technology networks and systems. Cyber and hybrid warfare
crisis scenarios are now also being integrated in NATO's annual Crisis
Management Exercise (CMX), where Alliance civilian and military
personnel test the procedures of decision-making and consultation
through realistic mock Article 4 and Article 5 scenarios. These and
other exercises like the annual Cyber Coalition Exercise are now an
integral part of building NATO's defensive cyber capabilities. As part
of the NATO--EU Joint Declaration at the Warsaw Summit, NATO is also
pressing ahead to boost its cooperation on cyber defense with the
European Union as both share an interest in becoming more resilient.
NATO and the EU signed a Technical Arrangement on Cyber Defense in
February 2016 to strengthen cooperation, communication, and information
sharing between NATO's Computer Incident Response Capability and the
EU's Computer Emergency Response Team. The EU has also become a regular
observer of NATO cyber defense exercises. NATO also increasingly
recognizes the importance of working with industry partners to enable
the Alliance to achieve its cyber defense policy objectives. A
significant effort --- the NATO Industry Cyber Partnership --- was
launched in September 2014 as a signal that NATO and industry must work
more closely together in sharing information, experience, and expertise
to counter cyber threats. Keeping Pace with an Evolving Threat Today
NATO faces ongoing efforts from antagonists, including non-state actors,
to intimidate and destabilize member states through cyber-attacks[. The
notion of cyber warfare is not new, but the scale, speed, and intensity
of the challenge demands a new approach toward the preparation,
deterence, and defense against these threats.]{.underline} One important
innovation that cyber activities provide an adversary is ambiguity, both
of intent and attribution. The source of cyber aggression is not easy to
identify and requires advanced technological capabilities that only a
few member states in NATO possess. Cyber aggression is even more
difficult to prove publicly because laws and regulations in cyberspace
are still incomplete. For NATO, the ambiguity of cyber campaigns present
challenges vis-à-vis action that needs to be collectively addressed
across the political, military, civilian, and technological spectrum.

**alter** the **character** of **warfare**]{.underline}---much like

[Today's [malicious a]{.mark}ctors]{.underline} can now [seek to [cause
physical damage]{.mark} from remote locations through **digital
channels**]{.underline}, [wreaking **devastation** on a country at
**levels** that previously would have required a **kinetic
attack**.]{.underline}

On February 8, 2021, hackers breached the Bruce T. Haddock Water
Treatment Plant in Oldsmar, Fla. using known software vulnerabilities in
an attempt to poison the local water supply with sodium hydroxide---also
known as lye. They accessed the plant through its industrial control
system (ICS)---a system designed to allow for remote control and
supervision of the plant. Taking over the plant's controls, hackers
increased parts of the chemical, used to [adjust the acidity and remove
metals from drinking
water](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-intel-chairman-florida-water-plant-cyberattack), to
one hundred times over the normal level. The system used an [old version
of Windows, was accessible with a shared password, and had no firewall
protection against
intrusions](https://techgenix.com/florida-water-treatment-facility-cyberattack/).
Thankfully, [a supervisor noticed the dangerous change in time whilst
working
remotely](https://www.govtech.com/em/safety/Cyberattack-on-Water-Treatment-Facility-Suggests-More-to-Come.html),
averting a crisis that may have caused chemical burns and blindness
among those exposed to the toxic chemical.

U.S. government officials have recently expressed concerns about similar
vulnerabilities across water and energy sectors and other critical
infrastructure including [health, emergency services, food and
agriculture, and transportation
systems](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-intel-chairman-florida-water-plant-cyberattack).
The cyberattack on the water plant occurred just a week before a major
winter storm led to a widespread blackout and water crisis across
Texas. [More than five
million](https://time.com/5939633/texas-power-outage-blackouts/) went
without power and running water for several days, illustrating the
fragility of such interconnected infrastructure and the physical
devastation that could be caused in the event of a cyberattack targeting
the grid.

[Critical infrastructure is **not alone** in its vulnerabilities to
cyberattacks with physical implications]{.underline}---[[**supply
chains** are]{.mark} also [at **risk**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For at
least a span of months (if not years), [hackers have [exploited

as [March
2020](https://www.securityinfowatch.com/cybersecurity/article/21206223/more-questions-than-answers-as-solarwinds-breach-probe-expands),
[Russian hackers breached]{.underline} the [Orion]{.underline} network
management software designed by SolarWinds, a federal contractor, [and
planted **malicious code** likely intended to gain access to **sensitive
information**]{.underline}. Evidence of malware was first detected [in
December by a cybersecurity
company](https://www.newsweek.com/colorado-representative-says-solarwinds-hack-could-cyber-equivalent-pearl-harbor-1555994) that
also uses the Orion software. [The impact of the SolarWinds cyberattack

[disconnected]{.underline} the software from relevant
networks](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-update-cyber-incident-related-solar-winds-compromise),
[removing the possibility for **deleterious** effects]{.underline}.

#### Cooperation with NATO is key to cybersecurity- Chinese cyberattacks threaten critical infrastructure

President-Elect [Joe Biden's transition team has declared cyber threats
as "one of the defining challenges of our time."]{.underline} In its
early days, [the]{.underline} incoming [US administration must take on
cybersecurity threats as one of its key priorities.]{.underline}
[Nowhere will that effort be more important than with]{.underline} the
United States' closest Allies at [NATO]{.underline}, a cornerstone for
Western security. Today, [NATO's security is threatened by Russia's and
China's continuous cyberattacks]{.underline} on the Alliance and its
members. To accomplish its mission of deterrence and defense[, NATO
needs to implement a strategy of proactive,]{.underline} continuous
[responses to China and Russia]{.underline} in cyberspace, where great
power competition is playing out in real time. [Russia and
China]{.underline} challenge NATO and its members in cyberspace on a
daily basis, as part of ongoing hybrid campaigns to undermine the
transatlantic community. The Kremlin's actions [have involved intrusions
into Allies' critical infrastructures, manipulating Allies' elections
through hacks and disinformation]{.underline}, and even blocking GPS
information critical to NATO activities. The Chinese government has
engaged in cyber espionage against Allies' military capabilities[;
intellectual property theft]{.underline} related to sensitive
technologies, industries, and infrastructure; [and disinformation
against transatlantic countries, including around the
coronavirus.]{.underline} [These efforts to weaken NATO countries and
Alliance cohesion represent a persistent threat to Allied
security.]{.underline} NATO has recognized the collective dangers of
these hybrid attacks in cyberspace. Up to this point, however, [the
Alliance has taken a reactive approach,]{.underline} responding as if
Russian and Chinese cyber attacks are each isolated incidents. But
[because Russian and Chinese cyber efforts are part of continuous
campaigns directed at the overall capability of the Alliance, NATO's
response has been insufficient, failing to reduce or dissuade further
attacks.]{.underline} To assure the security of its members going
forward, [NATO needs its own continuous response campaign to these
threats.]{.underline} President-elect Biden and his team have pledged to
renew US leadership in cooperation with Allies and partners. [That
agenda should start at NATO, and a key focus should be on
cybersecurity.]{.underline} In early NATO meetings, the Biden
administration should champion a cybersecurity continuous-response
campaign, built around three key actions.

### Russia Attacks Increasing

#### [Russia's]{.underline} failure in the Ukraine means it will resort to more cyber-attacks.

)

Is Putin Planning a Cyber Attack? The director of one of the United
Kingdom's top spy agencies warned that [Russia is looking to target the
U.S., NATO, and European Union countries with cyberattacks for their
ongoing support of Ukraine. Putin's Cyberwarfare Plan The war in Ukraine
isn't going well for Russian]{.underline} President Vladimir Putin and
the Kremlin. The Russian military has suffered failure after failure in
Ukraine, losing thousands of troops, tanks, aircraft, and vehicles in
the process. [Russia and Putin are becoming an international
pariah]{.underline} as NATO wants to add new members. Sweden and Finland
have decided to shed hundreds of years of non-alignment and join the
transatlantic military alliance. It seems that **[cyberwarfare remains
the one warfighting domain in which Russia can truly be effective and a
tool Putin can leverage. And the West knows that]{.underline}**. In a
cyber security conference, Sir Jeremy Fleming, the director of the
Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), warned that the
**[Russian military and intelligence services are searching for targets
in the West to potentially attack with cyberweapons]{.underline}**.
"We're seeing it in cyber too. Perhaps, the concept of a 'cyber war' was
over-hyped. But, there's plenty of cyber about, including a range of
activity we and partners have attributed to Russia. We've seen what
looks like some spill over of activity affecting other countries. And
we've seen indications that Russia's cyber operatives continue to look
for targets in countries that are opposing their actions," the GCHQ
director said. GCHQ is the signals and cyber intelligence agency of the
U.K. and an equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). Is
Putin Thinking Cyberattack? On the eve of the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, [Russian hackers launched a cyberattack against the Ukrainian
military's secure communications in an attempt to frustrate or takedown
altogether its command and control (C2) functions]{.underline}. The idea
was to prevent commanders from effectively and timely communicating with
one another and their troops as the Russian ground and air forces were
launching their operations. However, the attack spilled over and took
down satellite communications in other countries, disrupting operations
and internet service for thousands. "Today, in support of the European
Union and other partners, the United States is sharing publicly its
assessment that Russia launched cyber attacks in late February against
commercial satellite communications networks to disrupt Ukrainian
command and control during the invasion, and those actions had spillover
impacts into other European countries. The activity disabled very small
aperture terminals in Ukraine and across Europe. This includes tens of
thousands of terminals outside of Ukraine that, among other things,
support wind turbines and provide Internet services to private
citizens," the U.S. Department of State stated last week in a press
release In addition to that cyberattack, the Russian intelligence
services had been targeting Ukraine with repeated cyberattacks in the
years and months before the invasion. "The UK's National Cyber Security
Centre (NCSC) assesses that the Russian Military Intelligence was almost
certainly involved in the 13 January defacements of Ukrainian government
websites and the deployment of Whispergate destructive malware. The NCSC
also assesses that it is almost certain Russia was responsible for the
subsequent cyber-attack impacting Viasat on 24 February," the U.K.
government announced.

#### Russian cyberattacks are coming and NATO is vulnerable- cyberwar is the lynchpin of Russia's strategy of countering the US

**Dolan 2/15/22**

Dr. Chris J. Dolan is a Professor of Political Science and Director of
the Master's of Science Intelligence and Security at Lebanon Valley
College; NATO Must Boost Hybrid Warfare Defenses; Just Security;
https://www.justsecurity.org/80176/nato-must-boost-hybrid-warfare-defenses/

[Russia]{.underline} could launch a conventional military invasion of
Ukraine at any moment, but it [could]{.underline} also
[destabilize]{.underline} and undermine it [without ever firing a
shot.]{.underline} [Russian military exercises]{.underline} and
positioning [are powerful tools]{.underline} of unpredictability [that
keep NATO]{.underline} and Ukraine [off balance while Russian
operatives]{.underline} and their proxies [wage a hybrid war
through]{.underline} covert operations, coordinated disinformation
campaigns, and [cyber attacks]{.underline}. To build resilience against
hybrid warfare, NATO should collaborate with the private sector and
devote more resources to technology literacy and innovation.¶ Russia's
Hybrid Warfare Strategy¶ [Russia's strategy is centered on promoting a
narrative of grievances]{.underline}. Russia believes the United States
is using Ukraine and promoting NATO expansion to contain Russian
national security interests and encroach on its traditional spheres of
influence. It also contends that Ukraine should return to the Minsk
Agreements and end its attempt to win back Donbas. These are false
narratives because sovereign and independent states have the freedom to
determine their own path and seek membership in any alliance. And it
would be madness for the Ukrainian government to retake Donbas given the
Russian military presence there. The Russian rhetoric is a trojan horse
created by the Kremlin to renegotiate the end of the Cold War and redraw
European borders the same way Russia did when it illegally annexed
Crimea in 2014.¶ **[The effectiveness of the Russian narrative depends
on combining conventional military positioning with hybrid
tactics]{.underline}** or "active measures." [Hybrid
actions]{.underline} taken in the so-called "gray-zone" typically
[consist of]{.underline} measures short of conventional warfare such as
limited strikes, special operations forces, raids, [cyber
attacks]{.underline}, and covert influence operations. **[Hybrid warfare
is a central element of Russia's military strategy]{.underline}**, in
which operatives remain just below the radar and work with proxies to
stage false flags to justify an invasion. To crush the Prague Spring in
1968, Soviet operatives in Czechoslovakia planted weapons in packages
labeled "Made in the USA," which were published in Soviet
state-controlled outlets as signs of a U.S.-led plot. The KGB ran active
measures during the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 1980's, often using
"false bands" of Afghan units posing as CIA-backed guerillas to justify
Soviet military operations.¶ [Misinformation and disinformation are
quickly]{.underline} and efficiently [distributed through]{.underline}
news channels and social [media to influence public
opinion]{.underline}. Russian state-owned outlets Russia Today (RT),
Tass, and Sputnik have a strong presence on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,
and Telegram, echoing the Kremlin's position and portraying NATO and the
United States as aggressors. In 2013-2014, Russian state media framed
the Maidan protests that toppled Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych
as "fomented by the U.S. in cooperation with fascist Ukrainian
nationalists" that were used as a pretext for Russia's little green men
to seize Crimea.¶ One Russian-backed channel on YouTube is НАШ or NASH
TV, which has been promoting Russia's narrative until it was banned in
Ukraine. Founded by former pro-Russia Ukraine parliament member Yevheniy
Murayev, NASH TV is a Kremlin mouth piece flooding viewers with
anti-American and anti-NATO falsehoods. Last month, the United Kingdom
accused Russia of attempting to overthrow Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky and replace him with Murayev. [This is the same approach used
by Russia when it seized Crimea]{.underline} and installed Sergey
Aksyonov as the so-called Prime Minister of Crimea.¶ [Sustained Russian
information operations reinforce specific elements in Moscow's narrative
of grievances]{.underline}. First, NATO's eastward expansion since the
end of the Cold War is the real threat, not Russia. Second, Ukraine and
Georgia joining NATO would threaten the European security order. Third,
the annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in Donbas are
liberations of Russian-speaking communities.¶ [Troll factories and bots
spread large volumes of fake news stories,]{.underline} making it almost
impossible to counter the steady deluge of disinformation. On January
31, it Western media reported that Russia planted fake stories about
bomb threats against Ukrainian schools and shopping malls, forcing
children to online learning and closing businesses. Just last week, U.S.
officials uncovered a plot by Russian intelligence to fabricate a
propaganda video portraying fake explosions, corpses, and grieving women
designed to legitimate a Russian invasion to protect civilians in
Ukraine.¶ **[Russia supplements information operations with cyber
attacks]{.underline}**. [Russian hackers recently breached Ukrainian
networks]{.underline}, replacing publicly facing websites with messages
in Ukrainian and Polish designed to look like a Polish cyber operation.
[Russian cyber attacks targeted Georgian networks during the 2008 South
Ossetia War]{.underline} and again in 2015 when Sandworm, a hacking
group linked with Russian intelligence, took down Ukraine's power grid.¶
**[Russian state-sponsored cyber attacks targeting Ukraine can devastate
U.S. and NATO networks.]{.underline}** The 2017 Notpetya and WannaCry
attacks spread throughout the world soon after hitting their targets.
[In the 2020 Solar Winds hack, cyber criminals directed by Russian
intelligence inserted malicious code into updates]{.underline} in Orion
software [that infected servers used by the U.S. Treasury, Energy, and
Defense Departments]{.underline}, as well as Microsoft, Intel, and
Cisco. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
recently warned **[U.S. networks are vulnerable to more Russian cyber
attacks]{.underline}**.¶ [Russia also uses blended cyber
operations]{.underline}, in which governments tolerate cyber criminals
and ransomware groups operating in their countries. For example, the
2021 cyber attacks against Colonial Pipeline, which controls much of the
fuel along the U.S. East Coast, were launched by criminal group Darkside
operating in Russia. Darkside locked up Colonial Pipeline's networks and
held data hostage until it paid a ransom of \$5 million.

Eight [cybersecurity authorities from]{.underline} the so-called ["Five
Eye"]{.underline} nations (United States, United Kingdom, Australia,
Canada and New Zealand) released a joint statement on Thursday
[warn]{.underline}ing that [more malicious cyber activity]{.underline}
is on the way [as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to undermine
geopolitical stability]{.underline}. Before we look at the statement in
any depth, an important five-pronged caveat is needed: Both the US and
the UK are among the primary antagonists in NATO's ongoing war with
Russia; They both have significant offensive cyber war capabilities of
their own; US intelligence agencies, at Obama's behest, have drawn up a
list of potential overseas targets for cyber attacks; Both countries
have surreptitiously conducted vast surveillance programs, targeting not
only their own populations but also citizens and government leaders of
other countries; The world right now is in the grip of the biggest
information war of this century. As such, any information coming out of
the Five Eyes' intelligence services should be treated with a healthy
dose of skepticism. That having been said, here are the first three
paragraphs of the missive: The [cybersecurity authorities
of]{.underline} the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and
the United Kingdom are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory. The
intent of this joint [CSA]{.underline} is to [warn organizations that
Russia's invasion of Ukraine could expose organizations]{.underline}
both within and beyond the region [to increased malicious cyber
activity.]{.underline} This activity may occur as a response to the
unprecedented economic costs imposed on Russia as well as materiel
support provided by the United States and U.S. allies and partners.
[Evolving intelligence indicates]{.underline} that [the Russian
government is exploring]{.underline} options for [potential
cyberattacks]{.underline} (see the March 21, 2022, Statement by U.S.
President Biden for more information). [Recent Russian state-sponsored
cyber operations]{.underline} have [included]{.underline} distributed
denial-of-service ([DDoS) attacks, and]{.underline} older operations
have included [deployment of destructive malware against Ukrainian
government and critical infrastructure organizations]{.underline}.
Additionally, some cybercrime groups have recently publicly pledged
support for the Russian government. These [Russian-aligned cybercrime
groups have threatened to conduct cyber operations]{.underline} in
retaliation for perceived cyber offensives against the Russian
government or the Russian people. The document also emphasizes the
frontline role likely to be played by Russian state actors, including
the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the Russian Foreign
Intelligence Service (SVR), Russian General Staff Main Intelligence
Directorate (GRU), GRU's Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST)
and the Central Scientific Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics
(TsNIIKhM) of the Russian Ministry of Defense. Clearly, [Russia has the
capability to launch a barrage of cyber attacks against the
west]{.underline}; the question is: does it want to? [The authors of the
document urge critical infrastructure organizations]{.underline} to
[take immediate steps to protect against cyberattacks. Those
steps]{.underline}, they say[, should include patching known exploited
vulnerabilities, updating software, enforcing multi-factor
authentication, securing and monitoring]{.underline} remote desktop
protocol ([RDP)]{.underline} and other "potentially risky" services,
[and providing end-user security awareness and training]{.underline}. As
The Register, a British technology news website, notes, if any of these
recommendations come as a surprise to critical infrastructure operators,
"we're screwed". [The warning]{.underline} from the "Five Eye" nations
[comes]{.underline} just [days after NATO began]{.underline} (as
Bloomberg puts it) "the largest and most complex '[live-fire' cyber
defense exercises]{.underline}" ever conducted. [More than 2,000 people
from 32 nations were expected to participate in the war
game]{.underline}, which began on Tuesday in Tallinn, Estonia. They
include representatives of five to 10 large global financial
institutions, including Santander and Mastercard. This is all happening
[as fears rise that]{.underline} the boundaries of the [cyber
war]{.underline} between Russia and NATO [could]{.underline} soon
[spread beyond Europe]{.underline}, where attacks have been registered
not only [in Ukraine and Russia]{.underline} but also [Poland and
Finland]{.underline}. On March 21, President Joe Biden warned American
businesses to prepare themselves for cyberattacks. [Russia is likely to
deploy cyber attacks as a form of retaliation against US sanctions,
Biden said]{.underline}, adding that Russia has "a very sophisticated
cyber capability," which Putin "hasn't used... yet" but which forms
"part of his playbook."

### Russia Capable

#### Russia absolutely has the capability

**Tidy, 22** (Joe Tidy, 3-22-2022, accessed on 6-16-2022, BBC News,
\"The three Russian cyber-attacks the West most fears\",
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60841924)ao

However, [**Russia is a cyber-superpower** with a serious arsenal of
cyber-tools]{.underline}, and hackers [capable of]{.underline}
disruptive and potentially **[destructive cyber-attacks]{.underline}**.
Ukraine has remained relatively untroubled by Russian cyber-offensives
but [experts now fear that **Russia may go on a cyber-offensive against
Ukraine\'s allies.**]{.underline} \"Biden\'s [warnings seem
plausible]{.underline}, particularly as the West introduced more
sanctions, hacktivists continue to join the fray, and the kinetic
aspects of the invasion seemingly don\'t go to plan,\" says Jen Ellis,
from cyber-security firm Rapid7. Here are the hacks that experts most
fear. BlackEnergy - targeted critical infrastructure attack Ukraine is
often described as the hacking playground of Russia, which has carried
out attacks there seemingly to test techniques and tools. In 2015
Ukraine\'s electricity grid was disrupted by a cyber-attack called
BlackEnergy, which caused a short-term blackout for 80,000 customers of
a utility company in western Ukraine. Nearly exactly a year later
another cyber-attack known as Industroyer took out power for about
one-fifth of Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, for about an hour. The US and
EU named and blamed Russian military hackers for the attacks. \"[Russia
could absolutely]{.underline} try to [execute an attack]{.underline}
like this [against the West]{.underline} as an illustration of
capabilities and [to make a statement]{.underline},\" says Ukrainian
cyber-security responder Marina Krotofil, who helped investigate the
power cut hacks. \"However, no cyber-attack against a power grid has
resulted in an extended interruption of power supply. Executing
cyber-attacks on complex engineering systems in a reliable way is
extremely difficult and achieving a prolonged damaging effect is
sometimes impossible due to in-built protections.\" Experts like Ms
Krotofil also hypothesise that this could backfire on Russia too, as the
West is most likely to have a decent foothold in Russian networks too.
NotPetya - uncontrollable destruction NotPetya is thought to be the most
costly cyber-attack in history and has been blamed on a group of Russian
military hackers by the US, UK and EU authorities. The destructive
software was hidden in an update of popular accounting software used in
Ukraine, but spread worldwide destroying the computer systems of
thousands of companies and causing approximately \$10bn (£7.5bn) of
damage. North Korean hackers are accused of causing huge disruption with
a similar attack a month earlier. The WannaCry \"worm\" (a kind of
virus) scrambled data on approximately 300,000 computers in 150
countries. The UK\'s National Health Service was forced to cancel large
numbers of medical appointments. \"These kinds of [attacks would cause
the greatest opportunity for mass chaos, economic instability, and even
loss of life]{.underline},\" says Ms Ellis. \"It might sound
far-fetched, but [critical infrastructure often depends on connected
technologies]{.underline}, just as much as every other part of our
modern lives, and [we have seen the potential for that with the impact
of the WannaCry on UK hospitals]{.underline}.\" However, computer
scientist Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey, says such
attacks carry risks for Russia too. \"These types of uncontrollable
hacks are much more like biological warfare, in that it\'s very
difficult to target specific critical infrastructure in specific places.
WannaCry and NotPetya saw victims in Russia too.\" Colonial Pipeline -
cyber-criminal attacks intensify In May 2021, a state of emergency was
declared in a number of US states after hackers caused a vital oil
pipeline to shut down. Colonial Pipeline carries 45% of the east
coast\'s supply of diesel, petrol and jet fuel and the supply led to
panic at the pumps. This attack wasn\'t carried out by Russian
government hackers, but by the DarkSide ransomware group, which is
thought to be based in Russia. The pipeline company admitted to paying
criminals \$4.4m in hard-to-trace Bitcoin, in order to get computer
systems back up and running. A few weeks later meat supplies were
affected when another ransomware crew called REvil attacked JBS, the
world\'s largest beef processor. One of the big fears experts have about
Russian cyber-capabilities is that [the Kremlin may instruct cyber-crime
groups to co-ordinate attacks on US targets, to maximise
disruption.]{.underline} \"The benefit of instructing cyber-criminals to
carry out ransomware attacks is the general chaos they can cause. In
large enough numbers they can cause serious economic damage,\" Prof
Woodward says. \"It also comes with the added bonus of plausible
deniability as these groups are a step removed from an attack by the
Russian state.\" How could the US respond? In the highly unlikely case
that a Nato country is on the receiving end of a cyber-attack that
causes loss of life or huge irreparable damage, then this could trigger
Article 5, the alliance\'s collective defence clause. But experts say
[this would drag Nato into a war]{.underline} it does not want to be a
part of, so any [response is more likely to be from the US and close
allies]{.underline}. President Biden has already said that \"we are
prepared to respond\" if Russia launches a large attack on the US.
However, the [unprecedented cyber-chaos seen in Ukraine]{.underline} in
recent weeks from vigilante hackers on either side of the war [shows how
easily **things can escalate**]{.underline}. So any action is likely to
be extremely carefully considered.

### Miscalculation

#### Failure to coordinate with allies causes cyber attacks to generate miscalculation that escalates conflict with Russia

Alina **Polyakova** **and** Mathieu **Boulègue in 2021**

President and CEO of the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) as

University's School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) AND Senior
Research Fellow, Russia and Eurasia Programme @ Chatham House; The
Evolution of Russian Hybrid Warfare: Conclusion;
https://cepa.org/the-evolution-of-hybrid-warfare-conclusion/

[The current Russian leadership has no incentive to dial back its
efforts to undermine Western cohesion,]{.underline} especially since the
assessment in Moscow is that these are largely succeeding. [The West
should]{.underline}, therefore, [expect more]{.underline}, not less,
[tactical exploitation of the logics of chaos for the foreseeable
future]{.underline}. Despite individual countries becoming more
resilient to Russia's evolving hybrid warfare, as seen in the cyber
arena in Estonia and to some extent, the United Kingdom, the problem
remains that **[the broader Western alliance as a whole is still
underprepared]{.underline}** to cope with and respond effectively to
Russian destabilization.¶ **[As a result, miscalculation and overreach
by both sides in crisis scenarios are increasingly more likely and
outcomes more unpredictable]{.underline}**. [Geopolitical competition
will look]{.underline} less like a cold war and more [like a constant
barrage of violent episodes]{.underline}, low-threshold probes of
Western readiness, [and strategic deception]{.underline} and obfuscation
of targets and intentions. **[Russia's resolve to engender global chaos
could unintentionally lead to an escalatory cycle. This danger will be
compounded by Russia's relentless effort to probe NATO's
coherence]{.underline}** and ability to defend its member states.¶
[Without equal assessment and adaptation to Russia's evolving
tactics]{.underline} of hybrid war, [Western policies will become less
effective]{.underline} over the long run. Despite growing sophistication
in certain domains, such as cyber, Russian influence attempts are often
messy and opportunistic, taking advantage of weaknesses within target
states' systems.¶ Moscow has also shown itself to be effective at
identifying and filling, with minimal resources, power vacuums left
behind by Western, and in particular U.S., disengagement. [Comprehensive
measures to address these vulnerabilities should necessarily also
restrict the potential entry points for Russian influence
attempts]{.underline}.

### Deterrence

#### NATO must improve its cyber defense capabilities to credibly deter war

**Lindley-French '22** (Julian is a fellow at the Canadian Global
Affairs Institute and chair of The Alpen Group, 2-1, 22, To keep the
peace, NATO must be ready to fight the wars,
https://ipolitics.ca/2022/02/02/to-keep-the-peace-nato-must-be-ready-to-fight-the-wars/)

The NATO alliance is now facing what could be the most complex set of
challenges in its history. Given the nature and extent of the threats
against citizens of the alliance from Vancouver to Vilnius, urgency must
be the hallmark of Strategic Concept 2022 --- in essence, the alliance's
manifesto --- to more clearly stress defence against, and deterrence of,
Russian aggression in the region. **[[Russia continues to pose the most
immediate threat to NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** (also called the North
Atlantic Alliance). The latter will continue seeking dialogue with
Russia and honouring the NATO-Russia Founding Act, even though Russia
continues to breach the values, principles, trust, and commitments that
were meant to underpin the NATO-Russia Council. Much will depend on
Russia's aggression toward Ukraine, and the alliance can't stand aside.
NATO should launch a Ukrainian Deterrence Initiative to provide military
equipment and training, as well as enhance Ukraine's resilience.
**[Terrorism continues to challenge the rules-based international order
by undermining democracy and stability]{.underline}** across the globe.
**[China's rise as a military power will be the main cause of change in
the coming decade]{.underline}**. While NATO must seek to maintain a
constructive dialogue with China, possibly through some form of
NATO-China Council, Beijing's growing influence and power present
challenges that the alliance must address. NATO must also grasp failure,
and reflect on hard lessons from the chaotic and tragic withdrawal from
Afghanistan. The need for realistic political objectives allied to
strategic patience must be reinforced by strengthened political cohesion
and the equitable sharing of risk and cost. Mass disruption and mass
destruction are merging into a continuum of risk, challenge, and threat,
which the alliance must contend with across a broad spectrum of tasks,
from defence and deterrence to engagement. Strategic Concept 2022 must
reset NATO's purpose. The alliance will continue to lead the collective
defence of Europe in accordance with Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.
**[NATO remains vital to effective crisis management]{.underline}**, and
has a critical role to play in promoting co-operative security with
partners in and around Europe and across the wider world. Something old,
something new? The principle of resilience, making civil society more
robust, is anchored in Article 3 of the alliance's founding treaty. NATO
has also reaffirmed that national and collective resilience is a vital
component of credible deterrence and defence***[. [Cyberattacks and
information warfare on critical civilian and military infrastructures
are now deemed clear and present dangers, and must be
countered]{.mark}.]{.underline}*** But it's deterrence and defence that
must remain NATO's core business. **[*[If the alliance is to remain
credible as a peacekeeper,]{.mark}* [NATO must always be a capable
warfighter. NATO forces must meet the challenge of the fast-changing
character and conduct of warfare, which now stretches across a mosaic of
information war, cyberwa]{.mark}r, and increasingly precise and rapid
"hyper wa]{.underline}**r." U.S. armed forces will continue to lead NATO
for operations in Europe, but they're engaged with the world. By 2030, a
more equitable sharing of alliance burdens is needed, built on a
commitment by the European allies to field 50 per cent of NATO's minimum
military requirement. Call it European strategic autonomy or strategic
responsibility; either way, it realizes that greater European military
capability will be vital. By 2030, Canadian and European allies must be
able to deploy a NATO Allied Command Operations Mobile Heavy Force
(AMHF). By consolidating all Allied Rapid Response Forces into a single
pool of forces, the AMHF could act in any and all emergencies as a
high-end first responder NATO Future Force that reinforces rather than
drains the Americans. Fail to act now, and Europe could face a digital
Pearl Harbor from which it wouldn't recover. **[A catastrophic "bolt
from the blue" would combine strategy, capability, new technologies of
intelligent design, artificial intelligence, Big Data, quantum
computing, etc., to decisively change the character of warfare, and
Europe with it.]{.underline}** By 2030, NATO must be a very different
alliance, because it will be in a very different place. Otherwise, it
could fail, although any such failure might not be the catastrophic
demise some have predicted for so long. A Potemkin NATO would simply be
yet more European-defence pretence: a pretty, reassuring façade of false
security. Strategic Concept 2022 is the best chance NATO leaders have to
set the alliance on course for 2030. Collectively, they must generate
the necessary will, vision, and leadership.

### Impact -- Russia War 

#### NATO-Russia war goes nuclear and kills billions

**Majumdar 18** (Dave Majumdar (the defense editor for the National
Interest). "Doomsday: Why a **[War with Russia Would Go Nuclear (And
Kill Billions]{.underline}** of People)." The National Interest. January
25, 2018.
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/doomsday-why-war-russia-would-go-nuclear-kill-billions-24214>)

[A NATO counter-offensive would be **bloody and fraught with escalatory
risk**---but it's one of the **probable outcomes of a Russian
invasion**]{.underline}. In that eventuality, Russian conventional
forces---of which only a portion are well trained and well
equipped---would likely be severely damaged or even destroyed. Moreover,
if NATO forces hit targets inside Russia or crossed over into Russian
territory, [Moscow might conclude that there is a danger to the
existence of the state]{.underline}. After all, Moscow has expressed
concerns in the past that regime change by the West is an all too real
danger. In that situation, [Russia might counter advancing NATO forces
with its arsenal of **t**actical **n**uclear **w**eapons]{.underline}.
While a recent RAND Corporation study concluded that Russia could
overrun NATO's member states Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the
Baltics within sixty hours, the war games did not simulate the use of
nuclear weapons. [If, however, a war were to breakout between NATO and
Russia, **nuclear weapons would certainly come into play---especially if
the conflict were going poorly for Moscow**. Unlike the Soviet Union,
which had a stated "no first use" policy, modern **Russia explicitly
rejected that pledge** in 1993]{.underline}. In fact, as Moscow's
conventional forces continued to atrophy during the economic and social
meltdown of the 1990s, Russia developed a doctrine called de-escalation
in 2000 . Simply put, if Russia were faced with a large-scale attack
that could defeat its conventional forces, Moscow might resort to
nuclear weapons. In 2010, Russia revised the doctrine somewhat as its
conventional forces started to recover from the aftermath of the Soviet
collapse---the current version states Moscow would use nuclear weapons
in situations "that would put in danger the very existence of the
state."

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, even in [an all-out
[nuclear war between the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite
horrific casualties, neither country's population is likely to be
completely destroyed by the direct effects of the blast, fire, and
radiation.8 The aftermath could be much worse: the burning of flammable
materials [could send massive amounts of smoke into the atmosphere,
which would absorb sunlight and [cause]{.mark} sustained [**global
cooling**, severe **ozone loss**, and **ag**]{.mark}ricultural
[**disruption** -- a **nuclear winter**]{.mark}]{.underline}. According
to one model 9, [an]{.underline} all-out [exchange of 4,000
weapons]{.underline}10 [could]{.underline} lead to a [drop]{.underline}
in [global temperatures]{.underline} of [around 8°C, [making it
**impossible to grow food**]{.mark} for 4 to 5 years]{.underline}. This
could leave some [survivors]{.underline} in parts of Australia and New
Zealand, but they [would be in a very precarious situation and [the
**threat of extinction**]{.mark} from other sources [would be great. An
exchange on this scale **is only possible between the US and Russia**
who have more than 90% of the world's nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, with stockpiles of around 4,500 warheads
each, although many are not operationally deployed.11 Some models
suggest that even a small regional nuclear war involving 100 nuclear
weapons would produce a nuclear winter serious enough to put two billion
people at risk of starvation,12 though this estimate might be
pessimistic.13 Wars on this scale are unlikely to lead to outright human
extinction, but this does suggest that conflicts which are around an
order of magnitude larger may be likely to threaten civilisation. It
should be emphasised that there is very large uncertainty about the
effects of a large nuclear war on global climate. This remains an area
where increased academic research work, including more detailed climate
modelling and a better understanding of how survivors might be able to
cope and adapt, would have high returns.

### Impact -- laundry list

#### Populism, econ, grid, health care

6/14/2022

[As tensions mount]{.underline} between Russia and the West over
Ukraine, [the threat of Russian cyberattacks]{.underline} against the
U.S. [increases]{.underline}. The Department of Homeland Security issued
an intelligence bulletin on Jan. 23, 2022, warning that [Russia has the
capability to carry out a range of attacks, from
d]{.underline}e[n]{.underline}ial-of-[s]{.underline}ervice
[attacks]{.underline} on websites [to]{.underline} disrupting [critical
infrastructure like]{.underline} power [grids.]{.underline}

"We assess that Russia would consider initiating a cyber attack against
the Homeland if it perceived a US or NATO response to a possible Russian
invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security," the DHS
stated in the bulletin, which it sent to law enforcement agencies, state
and local governments, and critical infrastructure operators.

Cybersecurity experts are concerned that in the wake of recent
cyberattacks by hackers affiliated with Russia, [the Russian government
has the capability to carry out disruptive and destructive attacks
against targets in the U.S.]{.underline} The [SolarWinds]{.underline}
attack, uncovered in December 2020, [gave]{.underline} the perpetrators
[access to]{.underline} the computer systems of many U.S. government
agencies and private businesses. The DHS and FBI accused Russian hackers
in March 2018 of infiltrating U.S. energy and infrastructure networks.

[Russian cyberattacks could]{.underline} include continued attempts to
[diminish Americans' confidence in elections, undermine economic
stability, damage the energy grid, and even disrupt health care
systems.]{.underline}

While some components of these systems almost certainly remain
vulnerable to Russian-aligned hackers, the Russian government is likely
to think twice before unleashing highly disruptive attacks against the
U.S., because the U.S. government could interpret such attacks,
particularly those targeting critical infrastructure, as acts of war.
The DHS bulletin stated that Russia has a high threshold for initiating
disruptive attacks. As a researcher who studies cyberwarfare, I believe
a more likely threat from Russian hackers is launching disinformation
campaigns.

DISTRACT, DISTORT AND DIVIDE

Americans can probably expect to see Russian-sponsored cyber activities
working in tandem with propaganda campaigns. These activities are likely
to be aimed at preventing a unified response to Russian aggression in
Ukraine.

Russian military doctrine includes the well-evolved concept of
information confrontation, which uses cyber means to create doubt about
what is true. Russia's information warfare strategy seeks to manipulate
information and relationships.

The specific maneuvers aim to bolster narratives, people and groups that
support Russian interests and undermine those that are counter to
Russian interests. The maneuvers, which include dismissing and
distorting information and undermining opinion leaders, are carried out
in the press and on social media.

Russian intelligence operatives are skilled at using technology,
including amplifying misinformation through fake accounts on popular
social media platforms. In effect, Russia uses social and other online
media like a military-grade fog machine that confuses the U.S.
population and encourages mistrust in the strength and validity of the
U.S. government.

Repressive governments like those in Russia and China have perfected the
manipulation of online information as a way to control their own
populations. Democracies are especially vulnerable to these techniques,
given the open exchange of ideas and lack of centralized control over
sources of information.

In addition, [U.S. society is polarized, and that polarization is
occurring at an increasing rate.]{.underline} A study by researchers at
the University of Oxford examined Russia's computational propaganda
against the U.S. between 2013 and 2018 and found that it was designed to
boost U.S. political polarization.

PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY

Though the Russian government commonly operates through its intelligence
services, including the technical experts in the GRU military
intelligence service and the spymasters in the FSB domestic intelligence
service, it also uses criminal groups to achieve its aims.

History shows that Russia is most likely to recruit proxies to carry out
cyberattacks that disrupt decision-making so that the attacks don't
point directly back to the Kremlin. There is no foggier battlefield than
cyberspace. That is one of the main benefits of cyberspace as an element
of national power -- a cyberattack almost always allows for plausible
deniability.

On Jan. 14, 2022, Russia arrested members of the Russian-based cyber
gang REvil who were responsible for the 2021 ransomware attacks against
meat supplier JBS Foods, headquartered in Greeley, Colorado, and the
Colonial Pipeline, headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia. The unusual
move caused cybersecurity analysts to wonder about Russia's motive,
including speculation about making it easier for the government to deny
a connection to the cyberattacks.

U.S. CYBER DEFENSES

National cyber defense is inherently challenging, but the U.S. is far
from defenseless. Several analysts have noted that the U.S. is the most
capable cyber power in the world. The U.S. also has 20 years of
experience dealing with Russian cyber aggression.

The Biden administration's tough stance on Russian hacking has made some
progress. And though disinformation is among the murkiest of cyber
strategies, cybersecurity experts are making headway on that front, too.

CAUSE FOR CONCERN BUT NO REASON TO FEAR

Cyber activity that creates room for Russia to present the seizure of
Ukraine as a fait accompli is much more likely than a crippling
cyberattack. Though Russia might temporarily deter a U.S. response to
Russian moves in Ukraine by disrupting U.S. critical infrastructure,
Americans are likely to present a unified and powerful response to such
an overt attack. I believe Russia is more likely to prefer a path of
insidious political polarization to weaken U.S. geopolitical influence.

Even if Russia were to launch extensive cyberattacks against the U.S.,
the average American is unlikely to be harmed. The disruption of natural
gas and food supplies would clearly have a significant economic impact,
but it is extremely rare for a cyberattack to lead to loss of life.

If you are worried about the situation in Ukraine and wondering what you
can do to defend against Russian cyberattacks, I recommend tuning out
divisive rhetoric and cultivating common ground with Americans whom you
might not agree with. Though there are many issues U.S. society is
working through, Americans can still try to find some general agreement
in the principles of the American experiment.

### Impact -- Econ

**Decline would collapse deterrence\-\-\--that causes
[extinction]{.underline} but keeping it [solves the case]{.underline}**

**Tønnesson 15** (Research Professor, Peace Research Institute Oslo;
Leader of East Asia Peace program, Uppsala University, 2015,
"Deterrence, interdependence and Sino--US peace," International Area
Studies Review, Vol. 18, No. 3, p. 297-311)

Several [recent works]{.underline} on China and Sino--US relations [have
made]{.underline} substantial [contributions to the current
understanding of how and under what circumstances]{.underline} a
combination of [nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence may
reduce the risk of war between major powers]{.underline}. At least four
conclusions can be drawn from the review above: first, those who say
that [interdependence may **both inhibit and drive
conflict**]{.underline} are right. [Interdependence raises the cost of
conflict]{.underline} for all sides [but]{.underline} [asymmetrical or
unbalanced dependencies and [negative trade expectations]{.mark} may
[generate tensions leading to trade wars]{.mark} among interdependent
states [that]{.mark} in turn **[increase]{.mark} the [risk of military
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Copeland, 2015: 1, 14, 437; Roach,
2014). The risk may increase if one of the interdependent countries is
governed by an inward-looking socio-economic coalition (Solingen, 2015);
second, the risk of war between China and the US should not just be
analysed bilaterally but include their allies and partners. Third party
countries could drag China or the US into confrontation; third, in this
context it is of some comfort that the three main economic powers in
Northeast Asia (China, Japan and South Korea) are all deeply integrated
economically through production networks within a global system of trade
and finance (Ravenhill, 2014; Yoshimatsu, 2014: 576); and fourth,
[decisions for war]{.underline} and peace [are taken by very few people,
who act on the basis of their future expectations]{.underline}.
International relations theory must be supplemented by foreign policy
analysis in order to assess the value attributed by national
decision-makers to economic development and their assessments of risks
and opportunities. [[If leaders]{.mark} on either side of the Atlantic
begin to [seriously]{.mark} fear or [anticipate]{.mark} their own
nation's [decline]{.mark} then [they may blame]{.mark} this on [external
dependence]{.mark}, appeal to anti-foreign sentiments, contemplate the
[use]{.mark} of [force]{.mark} to gain respect or credibility, adopt
protectionist policies, [and]{.mark} ultimately **[refuse to be deterred
by]{.mark}** either **[nuclear arms]{.mark}** or prospects of
socioeconomic calamities. Such a dangerous shift could happen
**abruptly**]{.underline}, i.e. under the instigation of actions by a
third party -- or against a third party. Yet as long as there is both
nuclear deterrence and interdependence, the tensions [in East
Asia]{.underline} are unlikely to escalate to war. As Chan (2013) says,
all states in the region are aware that they cannot count on support
from either China or the US if they make provocative moves. [[The
greatest risk is]{.mark} not that a territorial dispute leads to war
under present circumstances but [that **changes in the world
economy**]{.mark} alter those circumstances in ways that [render
inter-state peace]{.mark} more [precarious]{.mark}]{.underline}. If
China and the US fail to rebalance their financial and trading relations
(Roach, 2014) then a trade war could result, interrupting transnational
production networks, provoking social distress, and exacerbating
nationalist emotions. [This could have unforeseen consequences in the
field of security, with nuclear deterrence remaining the only factor to
protect the world from Armageddon, and unreliably so]{.underline}.
**[[Deterrence could lose]{.mark} its [credibility]{.mark}: one of the
two [great powers might gamble]{.mark} that the other yield [in a
cyber]{.mark}-war [or conventional]{.mark} limited
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or third party countries might engage in
conflict with each other, with a view to obliging Washington or Beijing
to intervene.

### Impact -- Grid

#### A cyber attack on the power grid causes nuclear war

**Tilford 12** (Robert, Graduate US Army Airborne School, Ft. Benning,
Georgia, "Cyber attackers could shut down the electric grid for the
entire east coast" 2012,
<http://www.examiner.com/article/cyber-attackers-could-easily-shut-down-the-electric-grid-for-the-entire-east-coa>
\*\*\*we don't agree with the ableist language)

To make matters worse [**[a cyber attack]{.mark}** that can take out a
civilian power grid]{.underline}, for example
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} also cripple **[[\[wreck\] the U.S.
military]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The senator notes that is that
[the]{.underline} same [[power grids]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
[supply]{.mark} cities and towns]{.underline}, [stores and gas
stations]{.underline}, cell towers and heart monitors also
[power]{.underline} "[**[every military base]{.mark}** in]{.underline}
our [country]{.underline}." "Although [bases would be prepared to
weather a short]{.underline} power outage [with backup]{.underline}
diesel [generators]{.underline}, within hours, not days, fuel [[supplies
would run out]{.underline}]{.mark}", he said. Which means
**[[military]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**[c]{.mark}**ommand [**and**
**c**]{.mark}ontrol centers [could **go dark**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Radar systems that detect]{.underline} [air threats]{.underline} to our
country [would shut Down]{.underline} completely.
"[Communication]{.underline} [between commanders and their
troop]{.underline}s [would]{.underline} also [go silent]{.underline}.
And [many]{.underline} [weapons systems would be left
without]{.underline} either fuel or [electric power]{.underline}", [said
Senator Grassley]{.underline}. "So **[in a few short
hours]{.underline}** or days, [the]{.underline} [mightiest]{.underline}
[military]{.underline} [in the world]{.underline} [would be left
scrambling to maintain base functions]{.underline}", he said. [We
contacted the Pentagon and officials confirmed [the threat of a cyber
attack is]{.mark} something **[very real]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Top
national security officials]{.underline}---including the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs, the Director of the National Security Agency, the
Secretary of Defense, and the CIA Director--- [have said]{.underline},
"[preventing a cyber attack]{.underline} and improving the nation's
electric grids [is]{.underline} among [the most urgent
priorities]{.underline} of our country" (source: Congressional Record).
So how serious is the Pentagon taking all this? Enough to start, or end
a war over it, for sure. [[A cyber attack]{.underline}]{.mark} today
[against the US [could]{.mark}]{.underline} very well [[be **seen as an
"Act of War"**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} could [be met with]{.mark} a "full
scale" US military response**.**]{.underline} [That]{.underline} could
[include the use of]{.underline} "**[[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**", if authorized by the President.

### Impact -- Disease

#### An effective health care system is key to preventing the spread of disease

**Peterson 14** (Kimberly Ann Petersen, Captain, Fremont, CA, Police
Department. "The Affordable Care Act: A Prescription For Homeland
Security Preparedness?" Submitted in partial fulfillment of the
requirements for the degree of Master Of Arts Security Studies (Homeland
Security and Defense) from the Naval Postgraduate School. September
2014.
https://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/43979/14Sep_Petersen_Kimberly.pdf?sequence=1)

[[An effective health]{.mark} surveillance [system requires that those
stricken by]{.mark} illness or [disease]{.mark}]{.underline}---[whether
accidentally contracted or intentionally afflicted]{.underline}---[[seek
treatment]{.mark} from a health care professional.]{.underline} [[The
health care professional works to]{.mark} diagnose the problem,
[prescribe care]{.mark}, [mitigate]{.mark} further [spread]{.mark}, [and
report the illness]{.mark} as necessary to the health care community and
possibly the government. [This]{.mark} process [is critical to]{.mark}
our nation's [security in the event of a bioterror attack]{.mark}, such
as with an Ebola virus or anthrax attack]{.underline}. The same holds
true in managing contagious diseases such as influenza or newly emerging
diseases. The sooner an illness or disease is correctly diagnosed, the
more options remain available to help mitigate the spread or effect.
[[Delays in diagnoses and therefore]{.mark} the [development of]{.mark}
appropriate [treatments can have a limiting effect on]{.mark} both the
health care community's and the homeland security community's choices
and [options in managing the]{.mark} spread and effect of the
[affliction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Jack [Hadley's analysis showed
statistically significant and positive support for the hypothesis that
having health insurance or greater medical care use improves health:
seven of the 10 natural experiments analyzed, six of the seven
longitudinal studies, 29 of 35 of the observational studies showed
"statistically significant results consistent with a positive
relationship between health insurance or medical care use and
health]{.underline}."170 According to author G. Kenny, [the uninsured
received only 55 percent of the medical services received by the
insured]{.underline}.171 [[Increased]{.mark} health insurance [coverage
correlates with]{.mark} an [increased use of health care]{.mark}
services]{.underline},172 [[which is likely to increase the chance of
earlier identification]{.mark} and mitigation of disease. This is good
news for homeland security. The uninsured are more than four times more
likely than the insured to delay needed medical care or forego it
altogether due to cost concerns]{.underline}.173 [[By increasing the
number of insured Americans, we]{.mark} also [increase the
likelihood]{.mark} that [those with]{.mark} contagious [diseases will
seek treatment earlier on]{.mark}, allowing health professionals to
identify, treat and mitigate disease spread more
successfully]{.underline}. This would include diseases of concern to the
homeland security community such as influenza virus, or any disease that
has the ability to spread from person-to-person. A 2012 report from the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence focused on "megatrends"
and future possibilities for the global world in the year 2030.174 One
area of focus was the [increasing likelihood that]{.underline} [[viruses
previously unknown]{.mark} in humans [would]{.mark} continue to [cross
over from the animal reservoir]{.mark} to humans due to increased
livestock production and human encroachment into the
jungles]{.underline}. Examples of prior occurrences include a prion
disease in cattle that jumped to humans in 1980 to cause variant
Creutzeldt-Jacob disease in humans and the bat corona virus transferring
to humans in 2002, known now as SARS.175 [These [diseases can be
devastating]{.mark} to the human population, [due to the lack of prior
exposure]{.mark}, [as well as the lag-time required to]{.mark} diagnose
the disease and [develop treatments]{.mark}. The same is true for any
emerging disease]{.underline}, regardless of source. [[Early detection,
identification, and mitigation are]{.mark} particularly
[critical]{.mark} with emerging diseases. New viruses appear on a daily
basis]{.underline}. Viruses utilize RNA rather than DNA in the
reproductive process. The RNA process is not as exact as the DNA
process, and the reproductions vary in their genetics compared to the
parent. This phenomenon is termed "antigenic drift," and it makes
viruses a moving target in terms of vaccination and treatment. As an
example, there are multiple strains of the rhinovirus (the common cold)
circulating at any one time. By the time a rhinovirus has passed through
a given population, it will be genetically different than the strain
that touched off the contagion. [Early medical care, diagnosis, and
treatment are particularly critical when dealing with newly emerging
diseases that are more dangerous than the rhinovirus, such as
[hemorrhagic viruses]{.mark} like the Ebola virus. These viruses [have
an extremely high mortality rate]{.mark}, as high as 90 percent in some
cases,]{.underline}176 [and for many there are no known
cures.]{.underline} [[When there are no cures for such]{.mark} deadly
[diseases]{.mark} early [identification and quarantine become the
primary management tools]{.mark}. Increased health insurance coverage
makes the U.S. better positioned to find and manage emerging diseases
earlier on in an outbreak]{.underline}. The same holds true for the
health surveillance system as it relates to food safety: an increase in
the number of Americans with health insurance is likely to increase the
health surveillance system's ability to help us in spotting food-safety
issues[. More insured people will seek medical care earlier on, which
allows the surveillance system to pick up on patterns
sooner.]{.underline}

Existential threats to humanity

[In considering the importance of biological warfare]{.underline} as a
subject for concern [it is worthwhile to review the known existential
threats. At this time this writer can identify a]{.underline}t three
[major existential threats to humanity]{.underline}: (i) large-scale
thermonuclear war followed by a nuclear winter, (ii) a planet killing
asteroid impact and (iii) **[infectious disease]{.underline}**. To this
trio might be added climate change making the planet uninhabitable. Of
the three existential threats the first is deduced from the inferred
cataclysmic effects of nuclear war. For the second there is geological
evidence for the association of asteroid impacts with massive extinction
(Alvarez, 1987). As to an existential threat from microbes [**recent
decades have provided unequivocal evidence for the ability of certain
pathogens to cause the extinction of entire species**. Although
infectious disease has traditionally not been associated with extinction
this view]{.underline} has [changed by the finding that a single chytrid
fungus was responsible for the extinction of numerous amphibian
species]{.underline} (Daszak et al., 1999; Mendelson et al., 2006).
[**Previously**, the view that infectious diseases were not a cause of
extinction was predicated on the notion that many pathogens required
their hosts and that some proportion of the host population was
naturally resistant]{.underline}. However, **[that calculation does not
apply to microbes that are acquired directly from the environment and
have no need for a host]{.underline}**, such as the majority of fungal
pathogens. For those types of host--microbe interactions [**it is
possible for the pathogen to kill off every last member of a species
without harm to itself**, since it would return to its natural habitat
upon killing its last host]{.underline}. Hence, from the viewpoint of
existential threats [environmental microbes could potentially **pose a
much greater threat to humanity than**]{.underline} the **[known
pathogenic microbes]{.underline}**, which number somewhere near 1500
species (Cleaveland et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 2001), [especially if
some of these species acquired the capacity for pathogenicity as a
consequence of natural evolution]{.underline} or bioengineering.

**[Erdogan]{.underline}** on Monday [accused the two Nordic countries of
**backing "terrorism".**]{.underline} "[Neither of these countries have
a clear, open attitude]{.underline} towards terrorist organisations,"
Erdogan said, [referring to the Kurdistan Workers' Party
(**PKK**),]{.underline} which Ankara has designated a "terrorist group",
[and other armed **Kurdish groups**]{.underline} active in Turkey and
its periphery. **["How can we trust them?"]{.underline}** On the same
day, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu slammed Finland and Sweden for
not extraditing suspects wanted in Turkey despite Ankara's requests. The
wanted individuals were either accused of having links to the PKK or to
the Gulen movement, which is blamed by Turkey for a 2016 coup attempt
that killed hundreds of people. In response, [the **Finnish foreign
minister**]{.underline}, Pekka Haavisto, [said that while he was
surprised at Turkey's stance]{.underline}, [he did **not want to
"bargain"** with Ankara]{.underline}. **[Erdogan]{.underline}** [also
targeted Stockholm in his remarks for its **arms sanctions** against
Turkey]{.underline}. [Sweden has **frozen arms sales to
Turkey**]{.underline} since 2019 [over Ankara's military operation
in]{.underline} neighbouring **[Syria]{.underline}**. The Turkish
military has carried out several cross-border operations in Syria since
2016, targeting ISIL (ISIS) and Kurdish fighters seen as "terrorists" by
Ankara. Turkey controls swaths of territory in northern Syria and has
been accused by some NGOs of forcing out local residents.

Mensur Akgun, professor of international relations at Istanbul's Kultur
University, told Al Jazeera that [Ankara has also sought to use Sweden
and Finland's **membership bid as leverage** to fix the pressing issues
it has with the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, a staunch supporter
of the bids. ["Ankara has been under US sanctions over **F-35 fighter
jets**]{.underline} and is not happy about it," Akgun said. [Turkey's
purchase of the **Russian S-400 defence system** has been one of the key
issues]{.underline} that have strained relations [between Turkey and the
US]{.underline} in recent years. In July 2019, the US removed Ankara
from its key F-35 fighter jet programme days after Turkey received the
first delivery of the Russian S-400s. [The **US and NATO allies** say
the use of a Russian missile defence system by a NATO member is
**dangerous for NATO's own defence** systems]{.underline}, but Turkey
says it decided to buy the missile system after then-President Barack
Obama's administration stalled on a sale of the US Patriot air defence
system, widely used by NATO member states. [Turkey has also condemned
Washington's support for armed **Kurdish groups**]{.underline} in Syria.
[The US recognises the PKK as a "terrorist" organisation]{.underline}
**[but]{.underline}** [has **militarily** and **politically** supported

standoff in the summer of 2020. [Turkey says Greece is stationing troops
on islands in the Aegean in **violation of peace treaties**]{.underline}
signed after the World Wars, demanding that Greece demilitarize its
eastern islands, citing the 20th-century treaties that ceded sovereignty
of the islands to Greece. Greece counters that the islands need defenses
given threats of war from Turkey, which has NATO\'s second-biggest
military and maintains a large landing fleet on its Aegean coast. Turkey
in recent months has stepped up criticism of Greece stationing troops on
islands in the eastern Aegean, near the Turkish coast and in many cases
visible from shore. These islands were required to be demilitarized
under the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne and the 1947 Treaty of Paris, so any
troops or weapons on the islands are strictly forbidden.

This chapter seeks to offer preliminary answers to two questions. First,
to what degree will Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled information
warfare exacerbate hybrid threats to NATO decision-making? Second, what
can NATO countries do to alleviate the threat? To narrow the research
scope, this chapter will principally look at threats posed by Russian
AI-enabled information warfare operations under the concept of
gibridnaya voyna. The study argues that **[given that AI-enabled
information warfare has the potential to [amplify]{.mark} societal
[polarization]{.mark}, elite [disagreement]{.mark} with[in]{.mark}
domestic [politics, and reshape the perception of]{.mark} the
["Russia]{.mark}n threat" in NATO member countries, it can have [a
direct negative impact on national and NATO
decision-making]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Such operations, however, only
amplify existing symptoms of polarization and disagreement found within
NATO member states and are not their root causes. The chapter concludes
that [[NATO must]{.mark} better [integrate tech-centric]{.mark}
so-called "whack-a-troll" [tactics]{.mark} [with a **whole-of-nation
strategy**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} better **[safe-guard NATO decision-making
and alliance cohesion]{.mark}**. Renewed discussion of whole-of-society
defense concepts to inform national security strategies may be useful in
this regard]{.underline}.

Introduction [NATO defines [hybrid threats]{.mark} as threats that
"combine military and non-military as well as covert and overt means,
including disinformation, cyber attacks, economic pressure, deployment
of irregular armed groups and use of regular forces]{.underline}"
(2019). [Such hybrid methods are used to [blur the line between war and
peace]{.mark} and "attempt [to sow doubts]{.mark} in the minds of target
populations."]{.underline} [NATO further emphasizes that]{.underline}
["\[t\]he [speed, scale and intensity]{.mark} of hybrid threats [have
increased]{.mark} in recent years]{.underline}." [The latter can
partially be [traced back to]{.mark} various technological
**[advances]{.mark}** including **[in]{.mark}** the fields
of]{.underline} Artificial Intelligence ([**[AI]{.mark}**) and offensive
cyber capabilities, utilized in conjunction with deliberate attempts by
competitor nations to [undermine]{.mark} the political **[cohesion of
NATO]{.mark}** member states from within]{.underline}.

[[Hybrid threats pose]{.underline}]{.mark} a number of [[unique
challenges to]{.mark} political [decision-making]{.mark}
within]{.underline} both [NATO]{.underline} member [states
and]{.underline} the Alliance's various deliberative
[bodies]{.underline}, where decisions are based on the principle of
consensus preceded by consultation processes (NATO, 2020). In
particular, [meddling]{.underline} by outside powers [in political
processes]{.underline} by means of influence operations, broadly defined
as "organized attempts to achieve a specific effect among a target
audience," [is one of the top concerns of NATO leadership]{.underline}
(Thomas et al., 2020). [In particular, Russian]{.underline}
tactical-operational influence operations under the concept of
gibridnaya voyna ('[hybrid warfare']{.underline}) have been
[receiv]{.underline}ing a great deal of [attention]{.underline} since
2014. As Ofer Fridman notes, [such operations target society at large,
seeking to undermine political cohesion in an adversary state
[by]{.mark} employing methods that amplify the divisions and
[polarization]{.mark}s among its citizens]{.underline} (2018).

#### Hybrid cyber ops against NATO undermine cohesion through disinformation- new NATO strategy is key

Harlan **Ullman**, 1-30-**2022**, \"The Russia crisis has exposed why
NATO needs a strategy shift,\" Atlantic Council,
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-russia-crisis-has-exposed-why-nato-needs-a-strategy-shift/>

**[The standoff over Ukraine has underscored a pressing need for NATO.
Even though NATO leaders agreed to its new military strategy of defense
and deterrence]{.underline}** in 2019, given the events in Ukraine,
**[that strategy appears dated.]{.underline}**¶ Why?¶ First, Russia has
shown it is prepared to use its military in anger and certainly as a
threat. And it has modernized its conventional and nuclear forces. NATO
has not begun a major modernization for either its conventional or
nuclear forces. And the current strategy, at least the
[parts](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_185000.htm) of the
classified guidance that have been [revealed in
public](https://www.act.nato.int/articles/shape-cos-visits-act), offers
rhetoric and not substantial guidance on modernization.¶ Second, while
NATO created centers of excellence to deal with specific aspects of
hybrid war, **[the Alliance still has not produced a viable and
comprehensive counter-gray area/hybrid-war strategy with corresponding
capabilities. Russia calls these operations "active measures" that
include cyber,]{.underline}** propaganda, **[misinformation,
disinformation, and information operations to erode the will and
cohesion of NATO.]{.underline}**¶ Third, while [advanced technology
has]{.underline} generated revolutionary advances in military
capability, conversely, it also has [created greater
vulnerabilities]{.underline}---particularly in command-and-control and
logistics. Effectively [targeting these vulnerabilities will disrupt any
offensive.]{.underline}¶ In the 1940 Battle for France, had British and
French forces sustained air and long-range artillery attacks on the many
miles of German convoys crowding major roads driving west, one of the
greatest traffic jams in history would have resulted. That did not
happen.¶ Fourth, while NATO spends many times more collectively on
defense than Russia does, costs are rising faster than defense-spending
increases for virtually every item from people to pencils to precision
weapons. As an ironic result, the more is spent on defense, the more
[NATO's forces shrink in
numbers](https://www.amazon.com/Ever-Shrinking-Fighting-Force-Arnold-Punaro/dp/1735911402).¶
[All these factors would seemingly demand a major strategy
review]{.underline}. [The Ukraine crisis intensifies this urgency. The
question is whether NATO will take note.]{.underline}

#### Successful Russian cyber ops undermine NATO cohesion by spreading disinformation that erodes political support

[The conduct of modern conflict is constantly developing
with]{.underline} organizational and [technological innovation, and
through interactions with the participants]{.underline}. Russia's
leadership has notably had a more difficult task as the world has become
more aware of its nonmilitary influence since the 2016 U.S. presidential
election. The big technology companies --- Facebook, Twitter, and Google
--- also seem to have woken up to the fact that they are key arenas for
the information conflict, and have started to take countermeasures. On
the other hand, **[hybrid warfare still favors the attacker as few costs
are imposed]{.underline}**. Moreover, the conditions for such warfare
were particularly favorable during the Trump presidency and the higher
demand for information in the pandemic.¶ It is critical to put Russian
influence operations in perspective. [It is incorrect to dismiss them as
unsuccessful simply because]{.underline} both [NATO]{.underline} and the
EU [are intact]{.underline}, or because many of the posts coming from
the IRA have low viewership and low levels of interaction. In fact,
Russia, starting from a limited power position, is attempting to impact
the world's most powerful political union, the EU, and the world's most
powerful military alliance, NATO, by using relatively cheap means.¶
Moreover, [the aggregate impact of flooding the media with fake news is
often bigger and more important than interactions with individual pieces
of content]{.underline}. This can be seen in a study of the media
landscape in Michigan in the lead up to the 2016 U.S. presidential
election. It found that sensational and conspiratorial material as well
as fake news was shared a lot more on social media than well-researched
news, the proportion of well-researched news being shared was the lowest
ever the day before the election, and that Trump-related hashtags by far
surpassed Clinton-related ones.33¶ That being said, Russian
disinformation attempts can hardly be so effective as Trump himself
stating that it would be the most fraudulent election ever.34
Nonetheless, [it is lazy analysis to simply state that Trump was more
harmful than foreign meddling as that is a false dichotomy.]{.underline}
More correctly, **[the most effective influence operations have always
been about exploiting existing divisions]{.underline}** and local
actors. For example, Trump described Montenegro as "very aggressive" and
said that defending it would lead to World War III.35 The question is,
where did those views originate? It is hard to believe that they
originated from U.S. intelligence briefs. That narrative was only being
pushed by the Russian disinformation machinery. This illustrates the
fact that [the impact of disinformation cannot merely be measured
through Facebook interactions]{.underline}, it can also be seen in a
president's comments that draw either directly from Russian sources or,
more likely, from sources that are susceptible to Russian
disinformation.¶ [Even if Russian influence operations in 2016 did not
sway a single voter, they sharpened the polarization in U.S.
politics]{.underline} and society. This was manifested in the country
being tied up for years in debates on the extent of collusion by the
Trump campaign with the Russians and impeachment procedures.¶ **[The
threat from Russian influence operations remains real]{.underline}**,
even though they are, by their very nature, unlikely to have an
immediate or obvious impact. The EU and [NATO are dependent on political
support from their member states]{.underline}. [In these states, there
is some opposition to both institutions that can be amplified and
exploited by malign Russian actors]{.underline}.

**[The cyber domain is another area which holds a lot of promise for a
revisionist power like Russia to offset a more prosperous]{.underline}**
and superior **[West]{.underline}**. [Russia]{.underline} is skilled at
combining the use of different domains of influence. It [is a
sophisticated cyber actor that has the "full range of capabilities for
undertaking actions in cyberspace]{.underline} .... It implements a very
advanced offensive program."29 [These capabilities were shown in
Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election]{.underline} and are a reminder that [the most significant
impact of its operations was not through fake social media]{.underline}
accounts, **[but the hack-and-leak operation against the]{.underline}**
Democratic National Committee (**[DNC]{.underline}**), **[which started
with a cyber intrusion]{.underline}**.30 U.S. intelligence agencies
concluded that [the DNC hack sought "to undermine public faith in the US
democratic process,]{.underline} denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm
her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and
the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect
Trump."31¶ [Following the exposure of its meddling]{.underline},
including by the Mueller report, [Russia improved its modus operandi
with increased operational security and more stealthy
operations]{.underline}.32¶ [This included "a partly successful attempt
to interfere]{.underline}, [via hack-and-leak, in the French

### China Internal

#### [China]{.underline} is also increasing attacks on NATO members.

**[Cyberattacks against NATO]{.underline}** countries originating
[from Chinese IP addresses]{.underline} have [**increased 116**%
since Russia invaded Ukraine]{.underline} on Feb. 24, new research
shows. [Cyberattacks from Chinese IPs have]{.underline} also [risen 72%
worldwide]{.underline}, according to trends analyzed before and after
Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine by cybersecurity firm Check Point
Research. \"[As the Russia-Ukraine conflict intensifies]{.underline},
[we]{.underline} grew curious around cyber attacks originating from
China. **[We're seeing significant increases in cyber attacks that
originate from Chinese IP addresses]{.underline}**,\" Omer Dembinsky,
data group manager at Check Point Software, the software arm of Check
Point, said in an emailed statement. He noted that while Check Point
researchers cannot attribute the attacks to the Chinese government, \"as
it is difficult to determine attribution in cyber security without more
evidence,\" [it is clear to researchers that \"hackers are using Chinese
servers to launch cyber attacks world-wide, especially NATO
countries]{.underline}.\" Last week, [attacks from Chinese IP
addresses]{.underline} on countries [around the globe were 60% higher
than the first three weeks of the war in Ukraine]{.underline}. The
[increase in attacks]{.underline} from Chinese servers [is]{.underline}
also [significantly higher than the increase in cyberattacks over all
since Russia\'s invasion began]{.underline}, researchers noted. \"The
servers are likely used by hackers within China and abroad,\" Dembinsky
said. \"The trend can have many meanings. For example, the increase can
indicate where it is now easy or cheap to set up and operate a service
or where it is more opportune to hide the real origin of the attack. It
can also indicate how global cyber traffic is being routed at this
moment in time.\" The [FBI]{.underline} earlier this week [announced it
would be partnering with the private sector to combat foreign
cyberattacks against U.S. entities.]{.underline}

While we assess that a Russian attack on NATO in the near-term is highly
unlikely, [it also seems probable that Russia will explore other avenues
to signal its displeasure with]{.underline} ongoing U.S. and [NATO
posture enhancements]{.underline}. Russia has already announced that it
intends to adjust its domestic force posture on its western borders to
compensate for a larger NATO presence. In the past, Russia has used a
variety of mechanisms to respond to U.S. and NATO actions that it
perceives as threatening; such mechanisms include withdrawing from
multilateral security treaties, sending forces for provocative
out-of-area deployments in the Americas, and threatening to base
Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad, among others. [Other
options]{.underline} to protest U.S. and NATO enhancements in the
near-term could [include]{.underline} targeting cross-domain areas of
asymmetric concern to the United States and NATO, such as the
implementation of the Iran nuclear deal, [increasing support for
far-right Western political parties, and cyber attacks on politically or
economically sensitive Western targets]{.underline}

### Impact -- Populism

#### Populism [structurally guarantees]{.underline} more conflict and heightens escalation risks

**Drezner 17** -- PhD, Professor of Int'l Politics (Dan,
"[The]{.underline} Angry [Populist]{.underline} as Foreign Policy
Leader: Real Change or Just Hot Air?, *41 Fletcher F. World Aff. 23*,
Lexis)

[Leaders who rise to power in lower-probability scenarios
are]{.underline} also [likely to have a greater appetite for risk in
foreign affairs]{.underline}. This matters, as Jeff Colgan notes: \"risk
tolerance leads to aggression in international affairs because it
increases the perceived payoff of risky gambles.\" 17 [Populist leaders
more closely resemble revolutionaries than more established
politicians]{.underline}. [And]{.underline} as Colgan warns, \"[the
ambition]{.underline} of revolutionary leaders also **[contributes to
aggression]{.underline}**. [Ambition makes it more likely that a leader
will reject the status quo internationally as well as
domestically]{.underline}.\" 18 [We can see this kind of ambition on
display among elected populists]{.underline}. Hugo Chávez \[\*30\]
persistently proposed radical alternatives to the Washington Consensus.
One longtime friend of Viktor Orbán noted, \"he has always wanted to
upset the status quo, to become a change-maker.\" 19 Orbán himself, in a
meeting with Polish Law and Justice Party head Jaroslaw Kaczynski,
proposed a \"cultural counter-revolution\" in Europe. 20 Donald Trump\'s
inaugural address categorically rejected the postwar liberal order,
arguing in favor of an \"America First\" approach to international
relations. [Populists are therefore more likely to pursue high-risk,
revisionist foreign policies]{.underline}. [Populist
leaders]{.underline} also care about recognition by others, and [will be
quick to anger]{.underline} if that recognition is not forthcoming.
Populists build their legitimacy on their support from \"their\" people,
but part of that support comes from displays of dominance over others.
Russian president Vladimir Putin is well-known for his over-the-top
efforts to look strong and powerful. These range from his shirtless
photos to videos of him weightlifting to scoring eight goals in an
exhibition game with former NHL All-Stars. 21 In Erdogan\'s first two
years as Turkey\'s president, the government has prosecuted more than
1,800 cases of Turkish citizens insulting him\--including a former Miss
Turkey. 22 Donald Trump has insulted anyone who has criticized him since
he started running for president, ranging from erstwhile GOP rivals to
federal judges to media outlets to a former Miss Universe to Meryl
Streep. When dealing with domestic rivals and critics, such displays of
dominance are an easy strategy for elected leaders to pursue. Populist
leaders engage in such behavior to project their strength and mastery
over the political fates. It is tricky to do this on the international
stage, however. [Populist leaders will]{.underline} therefore [be more
concerned than most politicians about]{.underline} the personal
[respect]{.underline} afforded to them by others. At the international
level, this leads to one of two outcomes: recognition by other heads of
state, or a denunciation of leaders who fail to confer such recognition.
If [populists]{.underline} cannot exploit the respect conferred by
others, they [will be quick to reject and delegitimize the leaders who
spurn them]{.underline}. We can see this kind of pattern at work in how
populist leaders have reacted to setbacks on the global stage. Vladimir
Putin began his tenure in office with a much warmer attitude towards the
West. During the first decade of this century, however, Putin lost an
ally during Ukraine\'s Orange Revolution, and witnessed NATO expanding
to Russia\'s borders. It was at this point that Putin began adopting a
more hostile attitude towards the West. After President Obama cancelled
a meeting with Duterte, the Filipino president responded with a series
of tirades insulting the American president. 23 In Trump\'s first week
as president, he faced pushback from the \[\*31\] Mexican president
Enrique Peña Nieto on his policies for the southern border. In response,
Trump tweeted that Peña Nieto should not bother coming to Washington.
The Mexican president responded by canceling his visit. Populists do not
possess a monopoly on anger in politics, but most populists tend to
project anger as part of their leadership style. Based on their pathway
to power and their philosophy of governance, it should not be surprising
that they are commonly associated with that emotion. As previously
noted, populist parties do particularly well after financial crises.
They are adept at exploiting the (often justified) anger that voters
possess towards authorities that were in charge when the crisis
happened. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage warned of \"political anger\"
if the United Kingdom did not follow through on Brexit. In a press
conference blasting the United States, Duterte said, \"If you Americans
are angry with me, then I am also angry with you.\" 24 During one of the
GOP primary debates, Donald Trump explicitly stated, \"I will gladly
accept the mantle of anger.\" Trump famously refuses to apologize when
he makes controversial or problematic statements. 25 Numerous press
reports suggest that Trump lost his temper with the Australian prime
minister in their first phone conversation. [This wave of populist anger
reverses a centuries-long western effort to contain that emotion in
international relations]{.underline}. 26 Recent scholarship on emotions
in world politics suggest that [sustained levels of anger carry risks in
world politics.]{.underline} Anger was valorized in societies with
strong honor cultures and warrior castes, biologically conditioning
citizens towards that feeling. Furthermore, as Neta Crawford notes,
\"[threats that evoke anger]{.underline} (if they are associated with
perceived insults) tend to [**decrease** the perception of a threat and
simultaneously **heighten risk-taking** behaviors on the part of those
who feel angry]{.underline}.\" 27 This is particularly true if populist
leaders find ways to institutionalize anger and resentment through new
laws, executive orders, or bureaucratic structures. [This tendency
towards angry rhetoric can be exaggerated through misperception and
mistranslation]{.underline}. Conventional foreign policy leaders are
prepped to stay within the lanes of \"accepted\" diplomatic discourse,
so that observers can detect subtle shifts in phrasing as a foreign
policy signal. In contrast, populists scorn diplomatic language as
exercises in sophistry and hypocrisy. They rely on language designed to
appeal to their base, which increases the likelihood that outside
observers misconstrue their words. [Angry tirades from
leaders]{.underline} like Trump, Duterte, or Iran\'s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
have been mistranslated\--and usually in a direction that \[\*32\]
[paints the leader as more bellicose than intended]{.underline}. 28
[Populist leaders will be reluctant to correct such
misperceptions]{.underline}, because that would require them to engage
in the diplomatic discourse they have derided. Displays of righteous
indignation might play well with a populist leader\'s domestic base. The
international effect of angry outbursts, however, is to narrow the zone
of cooperation between countries. If a leader unleashes an angry tirade
against another country, that is sure to gain considerable public
attention in both nations. This automatically raises the \"audience
costs\" for both leaders. The larger the audience that is paying
attention to any dispute, the greater the political costs a leader can
suffer if they back down in that dispute. 29 Displays of temper make it
harder for the populist to compromise, but it will also make it more
politically difficult for the object of the tirade to make any
concessions. Through effects on leaders and populations, [provocations
make negotiations more costly and conflict escalation more
likely]{.underline}. 30 Perhaps the most important intellectual trait
that populist leaders share is their tendency to think like hedgehogs.
According to the classical Greek poet Archilochus, \"a fox knows many
things, but a hedgehog one important thing.\" Isaiah Berlin popularized
that quote, arguing that intellectuals could be divided into foxes and
hedgehogs. This works for decision-makers as well. Foxes will possess
the necessary metacognition to adapt to new facts and new circumstances;
hedgehogs will rely on their core beliefs, fitting the world into their
preexisting worldview. 31 Populists are hedgehogs: the one big thing
that they know is to reject the elites and technocrats who heretofore
governed their country. As Philip Tetlock observed more than a decade
ago, foxes and hedgehogs have different strengths when it comes to
thinking about the world. 32 Foxes are much better than hedgehogs in
their predictive accuracy about world events; simply put, foxes are
better at incorporating new information and updating how they think
about the world. Hedgehogs are better than foxes at anticipating big and
unexpected events happening in the world, such as the collapse of the
Soviet Union, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the 2008 financial crisis.
Anticipating those events requires an assuredness about the way the
world works that hedgehogs are more likely to possess. The effects of
these different intellectual styles on foreign policy are
straightforward. As hedgehogs, [populists are more likely to have their
expectations confounded in world politics]{.underline}. At the same
time, [populist foreign policy leaders will face psychological and
domestic political barriers to admitting error or reversing a failing
policy]{.underline}. Any public recognition of a misstep demonstrates a
leader\'s fallibility\--which is problematic for leaders \[\*33\] who
claim that they can divine the general will of the people. At the same
time, as hedgehogs, populists will be reluctant to take any action that
deviates from the way that they think the world works. Stepping back, we
can proffer some tentative predictions of how populist foreign policy
leaders will behave in the coming years. [Populist foreign policy
leaders are likely to reject the pre-existing liberal international
order and espouse]{.underline} a strong form of [ethnic
nationalism]{.underline}. They might try to create alternative
international arrangements to the status quo, but these efforts are
likely to be Potemkin efforts, with more pomp and circumstance than
substance. [Populist leaders will have greater appetites for risk and
ambition on the global stage]{.underline}. These heads of state will
crave recognition from their fellow world leaders, and be quick to anger
if they are spurned in this area. These displays of anger could become
institutionalized and will increase the audience costs of all the
involved actors, making cooperation less likely. And [populists are less
likely to correctly perceive how the world works]{.underline}, and more
likely to hold firm with policies that are not viewed as working
terribly well. [One disturbing conclusion to draw from this particular
constellation of traits is that populist leaders are more likely to
foment international crises]{.underline}. [Breaking with pre-existing
global governance structures can **guarantee a crisis
escalation**]{.underline}. [An international crisis can trigger
**rally-round-the flag** effects]{.underline} within the domestic
population and make it easier for a leader to suppress domestic dissent.
At the extreme, [one could envision populists threatening or launching
diversionary wars to appeal to a nationalist base in times of
trouble]{.underline}. Vladimir Putin employed this tactic. In early
2014, he was still reeling from protests over his return to the Russian
presidency, and a slowdown in the Russian economy. He responded by
annexing the Crimea after the fall of his ally in Ukraine, and
bankrolling a secessionist conflict in Eastern Ukraine. These efforts
caused his public support to skyrocket even though the Russian economy
contracted in 2014 and 2015. It should be stressed that these are all
probabilistic statements. Many of these traits are hardly unique to
populists; other heads of state are likely to display some subset of
these leadership traits. Still, [this combination of]{.underline}
\[\*34\] [attributes suggest that the world is **experiencing an
increase in the number of revisionist, risky, and violent actions in
world politics.**]{.underline}

### Impact -- Laundry List

#### NATO is key to solving the biggest threats to global security

**Burns '18** (Nicholas Burns - a former under secretary of state and
ambassador to NATO, teaches diplomacy and international relations at
Harvard. "What America Gets Out of NATO." The New York Times. 7/11/18.
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/opinion/what-america-gets-out-of-nato.html?)

Donald Trump prepared for this week's NATO summit by doing what no
president had done before --- making a case that the alliance is a bad
deal for the American people. Last week in Great Falls, Mont., he said
that he had told Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, "I don't know how
much protection we get by protecting you." Mr. Trump has been even
tougher on the European Union, branding it "as bad as Nafta" and adding,
"Sometimes our worst enemies are our so-called friends." I have visited
four European countries during the last two weeks, and it has been
shocking to see how far from grace the United States has fallen in the
eyes of its allies. European leaders point to Mr. Trump's support for
anti-democratic populists in Hungary, Poland and Italy. They view his
recent Twitter attack on Ms. Merkel as a transparent attempt to push her
from office. Many fear he may now remove American sanctions against
Moscow over its occupation of Crimea after his meeting with President
Vladimir Putin of Russia in Finland next week. Confidence in Mr. Trump
has plummeted so much that the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas,
recently grouped "Donald Trump's egotistic policy of America First"
along with Russia and China as global concerns. None of this, of course,
is likely to disturb Mr. Trump, who remains steadfast in his belief that
whatever benefits the United States gained from the trans-Atlantic
alliance in the past, the country no longer profits. But he's wrong ---
[there are compelling reasons that NATO in particular will be a distinct
advantage for America's security far into the future. First, **NATO's**
formidable conventional and **nuclear forces are the most effective way
to protect** North America and Europe --- the heart of **the democratic
world** --- from attack.]{.underline} Threats to our collective security
have not vanished in the 21st century. Mr. Putin remains a determined
adversary preying on Eastern Europe and American elections. NATO is a
force multiplier: The United States has allies who will stand by us,
while Russia has none. And while it's true that most of America's NATO
allies need to increase their defense spending under the treaty, they're
not freeloaders: [The United States has relied on NATO allies to strike
back against Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and the Islamic State in the Middle
East]{.underline}. European troops have replaced American soldiers in
peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and contribute the large majority in
Kosovo. [Our NATO allies]{.underline} are also getting better about
contributing their fair share. They [have increased their defense
spending by a total of more than \$87 billion]{.underline} since Mr.
Putin annexed Crimea in 2014. Fourteen more allies will reach NATO's
military spending target --- 2 percent of gross domestic product --- by
2024. Mr. Trump would be smart to claim credit for this at this week's
summit. [A second reason for maintaining the trans-Atlantic alliance is
**America's economic future**]{.underline}. The European Union is our
country's largest trade partner, and its largest investor. [The United
States and the European Union are the world's two largest economies, and
can steer global trade to their advantage if they stick
together.]{.underline} More than four million Americans work for
European companies in the United States. Forty-five of the 50 states
export more to Europe than to China. Mr. Trump is right that the two
sides are also economic competitors, and trade disputes are inevitable.
His predecessors kept this tension in balance lest there be damaging
consequences for American businesses, workers and farmers --- a good
reminder for Mr. Trump, whose ill-conceived trade war with Canada and
Europe risks harming the American economy. Third, [future American
leaders will find **Europe is our most capable** and willing **partner
in tackling** the biggest threats to global security: **climate
change**; drugand **cybercrime** cartels; **terrorism**; **pandemics**
and mass **migration** from Africa and the Middle East]{.underline}.
[And America's NATO allies will continue to be indispensable in
safeguarding **democracy and freedom**, under assault by Russia and
China.]{.underline}

European Union and diminish America's leadership in NATO serves none of
these interests]{.underline}. He seems driven by resentment about
European trade surpluses and low defense budgets, issues that blind him
to all the other benefits Americans derive from our alliance with Europe
and Canada. Mr. Trump may believe his blistering attacks on Europe's
trade policies and defense budgets are a good negotiating tactic before
the summit. But in fact they have already done enormous damage. While
**[he cannot]{.underline}** [outright]{.underline} **[kill
NATO]{.underline}** [--- the American public and Congress support it too
strongly]{.underline} --- he has eroded significant levels of trust and
good will. As it became clear during my recent visits across Europe, a
dangerous breach has opened in the trans-Atlantic alliance --- by far
the worst in seven decades. [Mr. Trump wants Americans to believe that
their allies are simply taking advantage of them. [On Sept. 11]{.mark},
2001]{.underline}, I witnessed a far different reality as American
ambassador to NATO. [[Canada and the European allies volunteered within
hours of the attacks to invoke Article 5 of]{.mark} the
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} treaty, which compels all members to respond
to an attack on any single member, for the first time in history. [[They
came to our defense when we]{.mark} most [needed them]{.mark}. They sent
troops to fight with us in Afghanistan. They are still there with us 17
years later.]{.underline} Are we now going to throw off that mutual
protection, and go it alone in a dangerous 21st-century world? That
would be a historic mistake. But that is where we may find ourselves if
Mr. Trump's anti-Europe vendetta continues.

#### NATO is [key]{.underline}\-\--it's a [full-spectrum]{.underline} force multiplier and [guarantees]{.underline} multilateral logistics 

**Weinrod 16** - Former Secretary of Defense Representative Europe and
Defense Advisor to the U.S. Mission NATO (W Bruce, "We Still Need NATO,"
The American Interest,
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/01/15/we-still-need-nato/)

[Not only does NATO remain relevant, but more importantly it continues
to support and advance U.S. security interests]{.underline}---though
again, often in ways that do not make headlines and that casual
observers rarely appreciate in full. Most fundamentally, [NATO provides
a standing multilateral military capability that can **deter or be
deployed** should a significant security threat arise]{.underline}.
Because NATO has a military capability in place, the core elements for
mobilization, deployment, and sustainment of substantial multilateral
military forces already exist. The [ongoing training, exercises, and
regular communication among the national militaries of NATO members
allows them to **jump-start** preparations and actions when needed
**without** very lengthy preparatory work]{.underline}. [This can allow
the U.S. government to proceed in shaping and leading military
coalitions more quickly, at less cost and with greater effectiveness,
than if NATO did not exist and its functional equivalent had to be
invented from scratch at a moment's not]{.underline}ice. While the U.S.
government retains the capacity and the right to act unilaterally if and
when necessary, it makes sense for it to act with others whenever
possible, whether through NATO or ad hoc coalitions of the willing. [A
multilateral framework can provide both political cover and military
resources, and the United States very much can benefit from
both]{.underline}. [The United States also benefits significantly from
NATO's **logistics** capabilities]{.underline}. Pontificating about
grand strategies sounds impressive, but for military effectiveness and
success, [logistics capabilities are what really count]{.underline}.
[For example, while NATO did not formally participate in the 1991 Gulf
War, NATO resources, supplies, bases, and other infrastructure provided
crucial support prior to and during the U.S.-led coalition military
action to force Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.]{.underline} The coalition
in effect borrowed NATO capacities already in existence, and benefitted
greatly from equipment compatibility and common training and resources.
[Other coalitions of the willing assembled under U.S auspices and
utilizing NATO resources can follow the same approach]{.underline}. In
addition, [the U.S. government has access to the numerous military
facilities and resources that member nations make available to NATO. A
good example is Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, now being used against ISIS
in what is not a formal NATO operation]{.underline}. As importantly,
[working through NATO usually makes it relatively **routine** for host
governments to **agree** to U.S. requests to use facilities within their
territory for military-related purposes]{.underline}. [Without
NATO,]{.underline} in order to fulfill its security responsibilities,
the U.S. government would need to develop and maintain a complex network
of bilateral and multilateral security agreements and arrangements that
would seek to maintain the kind of connectivity and flexibility that
NATO already provides. Further, [the U.S. government would need not only
agreements to access such military facilities but also would likely need
to obtain specific approval from the host nation for each use and
perhaps even in some cases legislative approval]{.underline}. In
general, [it is much simpler, faster, and **easier politically** and
otherwise for nations to grant the United States the use of their
facilities within a NATO framework than it would be to have to grant
permission to the United States on their own]{.underline}. Over recent
decades [NATO]{.underline} has, as noted above, [developed]{.underline}
a [global security]{.underline} network that reflects formalized
relationships with non-NATO nations. For the United States, this brings
the advantage that it can work through NATO to develop or enhance
security relationships with states that belong to the PFP, the MD, the
ICI, and NATO bilateral security relationships. [Working through NATO
provides an extra dimension to U.S. efforts to enhance the military
capacities of friends and allies in various regions who, with training
and assistance, can provide supplementary support to NATO or U.S.-led
operations. NATO also supports U.S. interests by providing a
multilateral framework for a U.S. presence in nations where the U.S.
government wishes to help train and also enhance its military contacts,
but where unilateral U.S. military involvement might be politically
contentious]{.underline}.

### Impact -- Democracy 

#### Democracy solves extinction

\"Democratising Risk: In Search of a Methodology to Study Existential
Risk\" <https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2201/2201.11214.pdf> //pipk

[[There is a]{.mark}n intimate]{.underline} and neglected [[relationship
between existential risk and democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Democracy must be central to]{.mark} efforts [to prevent]{.mark} and
mitigate [catastrophic risks]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is also an
antidote to many of the problems manifest in the TUA. Do those who study
the future of humanity have good grounds to ignore the visions, desires,
and values of the very people whose future they are trying to protect?
[Choosing which risks to take must be a democratic
endeavour]{.underline}. We [understand democracy]{.underline} here in
accordance with Landemore [as the rule of the]{.underline} cognitively
[diverse many who are entitled to equal decision-making power and
partake in a democratic procedure that includes both a deliberative
element and one of preference aggregation]{.underline} (such as majority
voting)45,115. Decision-making procedures are not either democratic or
non- democratic, but instead lie on a spectrum. They can be more or less
democratic, inclusive, and diverse. We posit [three reasons]{.underline}
for why we should democratise research and decision-making in
existential risk: [the nature of collective decision-making about human
futures, the superiority of democratic reason, and democratic fail-safe
mechanisms.]{.underline} **[Avoiding human extinction]{.underline}**, or
crafting a desirable long-term future, **[is a communal
project]{.underline}**. Scholars of existential risk who take an
interest in the future of Homo sapiens are choosing to consider the
species in its entirety. If certain views are excluded, the arguments
for doing so must be compelling. **[[Democracy will improve]{.mark} our
[judgments]{.mark} in both the governance and the study of existential
risks]{.underline}**. [Asking how our actions today influence [the
long-term]{.mark} future [is one of the most difficult intellectual
tasks]{.mark} to unravel, and if there is a right path, **[democratic
procedures]{.mark}** will **[have the best shot]{.mark} at finding
it**]{.underline}. Hong and Page116,117 demonstrate **[[both
theoretically and computationally]{.mark} that [a diverse group]{.mark}
of problem-solving agents [will show greater accuracy]{.mark} than a
less diverse group, even if the individual members of the diverse group
were each less accurate.]{.underline}** **[Accuracy gains from diversity
trump gains from improving individual accuracy]{.underline}**.
Landemore115, builds on this work to advance a probabilistic argument
that **[inclusive democracies will, in expectation, make epistemically
superior choices to oligarchies or even the wise few]{.underline}**.
This is [supported by promising results in inclusive, deliberative
democratic experiments from around the world]{.underline} 118. [In the
long run, democracies should commit fewer mistakes than alternative
decision-making procedures]{.underline}. If this is true, it should
improve the accuracy of research efforts and decision-making. We are
more likely to make accurate predictions about the mechanisms of
extinction, probable futures, and risk prevention if the field invites
cognitive diversity, builds flat institutional structures, and avoids
conflicts of interest. Thereare many ways to consider the interests of
the many. Democratic assemblies could allow global citizens to
deliberate about the futures they prefer, citizens could be surveyed,
and the field of ERS itself could be diversified. At the moment, the
field is, as many academic disciplines are, unrepresentative of humanity
at large and variably homogenous in respect to income, class, ideology,
age, ethnicity, gender, nationality, religion, and professional
background. The latter issue is particularly true of existential risk,
which, despite being an inherently interdisciplinary endeavour, is at
the highest levels dominated by analytic moral philosophers. We need to
be vigilant to what perspectives are not represented in the study of
existential risk. An awareness of bias will go some way towards
mitigating its negative effects. To get close to replicating the
cognitive diversity found among humans, we must begin by inviting
different thinkers with different values and beliefs into the field.
**[[Democracies]{.mark} can [limit harms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Any
approach to [mitigating]{.mark} existential threats [could create
response risks]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the TUA seems particularly
vulnerable to this. [Despite good intentions and curiosity-driven
research, it could justify violence, dangerous technological
developments, or drastically constrain freedom in favour of (perceived)
security]{.underline}. If we hope to explore ideas but minimise harms,
[democracies can]{.underline} be used to [moderate]{.underline} the
[measures taken in response to harmful ideas]{.underline}. It seems, for
example, vanishingly unlikely that a diverse group of thinkers or even
ordinary citizens would entertain the idea of sacrificing 1 billion
living, breathing beings for an infinitesimal improvement in reaching an
intergalactic techno-utopia. In contrast, the TUA could recommend this
trade-off. [The democratic constraint of extreme measures may simply be
a form of collective selfinterest. Voters are unlikely to tolerate
global catastrophic risks (GCRs), which incur the death of a sizeable
portion of the electorate, if they know they themselves could be
affected]{.underline}. We expect that scholars who do not support
sacrificing current lives in the name of abstract calculations, but
would still like to explore the use of expected value theory in
existential risk, will be in support of [[democratic fail-safe
mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Empirically]{.underline}]{.mark},
this fail-safe mechanism [seems to [work]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even
deeply imperfect democracies, like the ones we inhabit now, often avert
detrimental outcomes.]{.underline} [[Democracies prevent
famines]{.underline}]{.mark} 119 (although not malnutrition)120. They
[make [war]{.mark}]{.underline} --- a significant driver of GCRs ---
[less likely]{.underline} 121. The [inclusion of diverse preferences in
democracies]{.underline}, such as those achieved through women's
suffrage, further [decreases the likelihood of violent
conflict]{.underline} 122. [Citizens]{.underline} often
[show]{.underline} a [significant risk aversion in comparison to their
government]{.underline}. While surveys are notoriously difficult to
collect and interpret, existing **[data suggest that [the public has
little support for nuclear weapons use]{.mark}]{.underline}** 123--125,
**[[but]{.mark} strong [support]{.mark} for [action against
climate]{.mark} catastrophe]{.underline}** 126--128. We can further show
that **[[when citizens]{.mark} deliberately [engage]{.mark} with the
subject at hand, their [concern and readiness]{.mark} for action often
[increases]{.mark}]{.underline}** 118. For example, [citizen assemblies
on climate change have recommended widespread policy-changes across
sectors, amendments to incentive structures and laws against ecocide to
reach emissions targets]{.underline} 129. Indeed, many lament that when
it comes to genetically modified organisms and nuclear power, citizens
are far too riskaverse130 . The problem is not that the public is
riddled with cognitive biases that make them unconcerned about global
catastrophes. **[[Democratic debate cannot be an afterthought.]{.mark}
Navigating humanity through [crises will involve]{.mark} many
value-laden decisions under deep [uncertainty]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Democratic procedures can deal with such hard choices. Greater cognitive
diversity should be represented amongst scholars of ERS. Recommendations
on [[policies that would reduce risk should]{.mark} be passed through
deliberative assemblies and [await]{.mark} the [approval of]{.mark} a
wider pool of ordinary [citizens]{.mark}, as they will be the ones who
will bear this risk]{.underline}. A homogenous group of experts
attempting to directly influence powerful decision-makers is not a fair
or safe way of traversing the precipice.

### Impact -- Solves China

#### NATO cohesion is key to maintain US hegemony and influence globally against a rising China

[If a conflict with China arises, the United States will need
a]{.underline} strong, [cohesive NATO]{.underline}, as well as other
partnerships around the world [to maintain order and security in
Europe's neighborhood, and]{.underline} perhaps even
[beyond]{.underline}. The United States remains committed to Europe's
security and stability. But it also expects its European allies to pick
up their share of the burden for collective security so as to help
maintain order in the continent and around the globe. [It is of vital
importance to the United States that its defense and security
relationship with]{.underline} European countries, especially within
[NATO, not only remains healthy but is correctly oriented to current and
likely future challenges.]{.underline}¶ Several things remain to be
achieved if Europe and the United States in this regard. First, they
must build a common approach not only in defense, but across economic,
information, and political domains. Second, they must solve the
continued inequity in burden sharing that hinders a stronger
relationship between them and erodes the confidence of many Americans in
the efficacy of NATO. Third, it is necessary to achieve greater
coherence on NATO's eastern flank, particularly in the Black Sea region.
Fourth, NATO must continue its efforts to improve its deterrence
capability against Russia's aggressive behavior.¶ [The interests and
responsibilities of the United States are global, with freedom of
navigation on the seas and preservation of the global commons being
prime examples]{.underline}. [Its allies]{.underline} and partners
[benefit from these freedoms as well, but these have now come under
threat, most notably in the South China Sea and with China's growing
control over much of the infrastructure of the world,]{.underline}
particularly in Europe and Africa. [The threat from China is real and
growing]{.underline}, and [if it materializes the United States will
need a strong, cohesive NATO,]{.underline} as well as other partnerships
around the world to maintain order and security in Europe's
neighborhood, and perhaps even beyond, [while the majority of its forces
and capabilities]{.underline}, particularly air and naval ones, [are
operating in the Pacific theater]{.underline}.¶ [The stability,
security, and economic prosperity of the United States are directly
linked to that of Europe]{.underline}. [The bulk of its global economic
relationships are in North America and the European Union,]{.underline}
and the majority of its most reliable allies and partners are in Europe.
To give but one example, [the shared intelligence obtained from Europe
is essential to the implementation of the recently published U.S.
National Defense Strategy]{.underline}. In this context, [it is of vital
importance to the United States that its defense and security
relationship with]{.underline} European countries, especially within
[NATO]{.underline}, [not only remains healthy but is correctly oriented
to current and likely future challenges.]{.underline}

[A war between China and the United States is not inevitable, but the
next 15 years could see the eruption of such a conflict]{.underline}.
While this may not reach the threshold of full-scale war or a nuclear
conflict, the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have set
their country on a trajectory that will lead to a strategic situation
that may result in sustained armed conflict, potentially stretching
across the Pacific region, in all domains. Furthermore, the combination¶
of China's huge population, export-oriented economy, and lack of natural
resources could generate an inexorable push towards conflict.¶ [The CCP
leadership has emphasized the development of military capabilities that
could deny the U.S. Navy access to the South China Sea,]{.underline}
including long-range air and missile defense and anti-ship capabilities.
[This anti-access area denial]{.underline} (A2AD) [capability does not
depend on a large Chinese navy but instead uses well-protected,
land-based systems.]{.underline} The creation of artificial islands in
the region, most of which are already being armed and garrisoned with
A2AD capabilities, are violations of international law and agreements
that clearly demonstrate the CCP's strategy and intentions.¶
[Enforcement of freedom of the seas and recognized international waters
by the United States and others is necessary to counter these
policies.]{.underline} In one recent demonstration of CCP intent, there
was a near-collision incident between Chinese and U.S. Navy ships,
caused by unsafe and unprofessional behavior by the Chinese one.
Statements by the China's minister of defense during his recent visit to
the Pentagon, including demands that the U.S. forces stay away from the
articifial islands, indicate that his country will continue to push
aggressively its territorial claims.¶ Meanwhile, [in Europe China has
become an increasingly significant and potentially divisive influence in
a variety of aspects; especially in infrastructure, technology transfer,
and trade]{.underline}. The Belt and Road Initiative has resulted in
dramatic increases in Chinese investment in Europe, control of hundreds
of European companies, and ownership or control of more than 10 percent
of Europe's ports.¶ [These developments]{.underline}, and the CCP's
strategy and behavior, [are cause for concern about the potential for
conflict with China within the next 15 years. They also show why the
United States must prepare for this eventuality.]{.underline}¶ [During
the Cold War,]{.underline} [the United States used a "two and a half
wars" framework for force structure]{.underline}. This was not a
strategy, but rather a mechanism meant to assess how much capability and
capacity its armed forces needed to deter effectively and, if necessary,
win simultaneous conflicts in two different operational theaters and
"hold" in a third, minor theater at the same time, for as long as
necessary.¶ Today, and [for the foreseeable future, the United States
can no longer exercise this capability and capacity]{.underline}.
Therefore[, in the event of conflict with China, it will need a strong,
cohesive NATO as well as partnerships around the world in order to
continue deterring a revanchist Russia and to carry on counter-terrorism
operations in the Middle East while the majority of U.S. forces and
capabilities are operating in the Pacific]{.underline}.

## Solvency Extensions

### S -- Info Sharing 

#### Information sharing is the lynchpin to effective NATO cybersecurity.

[Cyber threat **information sharing** has bedevilled the cyber security
community for at least two decades.]{.underline} [Faulty assumptions
have prevented this fundamentally sound concept from achieving its
potential.]{.underline} But while information sharing is a tough
problem, it is not an insoluble one. If the cyber security community
adopts different underlying assumptions for information sharing then the
volume, quality, and utility of the exchanged information can increase.
In turn, [more effective, relevant information sharing will enable
defenders to better understand and anticipate adversaries, develop
mechanisms to disrupt adversary activities more strategically, and raise
the level of cyber security across the digital ecosystem.]{.underline}
Under these circumstances, cyber threat information sharing can finally
live up to its promise to enable better cyber security for everyone.
[For NATO, updating programmes to reflect these revised information
sharing assumptions would require significant changes to current
operation]{.underline}s. [First, overcoming the technical, economic,
legal, and cultural barriers to sharing relevant, actionable information
across member countries and economic sectors **will require sustained
attention, prioritisation, and funding from NATO's senior
leadership**]{.underline}. Absent such attention, the barriers will
likely prove insurmountable. Second, [NATO should build on its existing
MISP]{.underline} \[Malware Information Sharing Platform\] [use to
create a more **comprehensive system of information sharing that
broadens the types of information shared a**nd widens the number of
recipients]{.underline}. Third, NATO should consider how to better
leverage industry for technical information, while enriching that
information with government-derived information about context,
attribution, and intent. [If NATO shifted its approach to information
sharing as suggested, the Alliance would have the opportunity to assume
a leadership position in this area. If not, NATO will continue to
struggle to make information sharing live up to its
promise]{.underline}.

#### Status Quo Information Sharing Is Lacking -- technical data is not the only form of information that is valuable

**Daniel & Kenway '20** (Michael Daniel currently serves as President
and CEO of the non-profit Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA). Joshua Kenway is

[The assumption that cyber]{.underline} threat [information is
equivalent]{.underline} or primarily composed [of technical
data]{.underline} severely [limits]{.underline} the [potential value of
information sharing. Technical data]{.underline}, while necessary, [is
not the only form of information]{.underline} that can provide value.
For example, a warning from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
that a specific Chinese cyber group is targeting a US company with
cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property would be a useful piece of
non-technical intelligence for that company. [Written advisories about
vulnerabilities]{.underline} and associated patches [are critical to
organisations]{.underline} using vulnerable software or hardware; in
fact, [such information is]{.underline} far [more useful to most
organisations than technical data]{.underline} on one of the many
variations of the LockerGoGo malware. The most common interpretation of
information is too narrow. B. [Every Organisation Should
Produce]{.underline} and Consume [Technical Data]{.underline} If the
underlying assumption is that information sharing means technical
information, then it logically follows that most policies,
infrastructure, and programmes for sharing are built around the idea
that most organisations should produce and consume technical
information. [If everyone were to collect, share, and
consum]{.underline}e such [data, the thinking goes]{.underline},
[security would improve]{.underline} across the ecosystem.
[The]{.underline} problem with this [logic is]{.underline} that [most
organisations are lousy at]{.underline} [collecting, producing, and
consuming technical data]{.underline}---and always will be. Most
companies do not have the capability to identify a malware binary,
analyse it, and use the resulting information, nor would they know how
to handle a malicious domain name. As a [practical matter, this
situation will not change]{.underline}; [no country will have
enough]{.underline} cyber security [professionals for]{.underline} every
[organisation]{.underline} to have this capacity. [Small and medium
businesses do not]{.underline} and will not [have the resources to
collect]{.underline}, [process]{.underline}, [share]{.underline}, [and
consume technical data]{.underline} regularly. This [limitation does not
mean]{.underline} such [organisations would not benefit from cyber
threat informatio]{.underline}n sharing; [rather they need different
information]{.underline}. Neither is this approach economically
efficient. Most [organisations do not]{.underline} need
[access]{.underline} to [technical data in real-time]{.underline}.
Despite the rapidly changing nature of cyber threats in a technical
sense, for most organisations, [cyber security requirements
and]{.underline} best [practices do not change]{.underline} much [from
day to day]{.underline}. 2 For example, see the Cybersecurity
Information Sharing Act of 2015 (Consolidated Appropriations Act of
2016, Division N, Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015) and the
Automated Indicator Sharing Program (DHS Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency, 2020). 182 In addition, not every
business has in-house technical accounting or legal skills---why should
cyber security be different? [Current practice does not]{.underline}
sufficiently [differentiate between organisations]{.underline} in terms
of what information they should share under what circumstances and how
frequently. C. [Information Sharing is Easy]{.underline} In January
2008, the US government started the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity
Initiative (CNCI), formalising it in National Security Presidential
Directive 54 / Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23 (The White
House, 2010). 'Connect the Centers,' one of CNCI's twelve lines of
effort, focused on information sharing with the goal of linking the US
government's cyber centres into one common operating picture; over the
long-term, it was intended to incorporate the private sector. [Everyone
assumed that this element would be the easiest]{.underline} to implement
and the first to be completed. However[, thirteen years later, this
element is]{.underline} arguably [one part]{.underline} of the CNCI
vision [that remains unrealise]{.underline}d as the [cyber security
centres are no]{.underline}t seamlessly [connected]{.underline} and
[many silos remain]{.underline} stubbornly [in place]{.underline}. A
similar situation has played out in the private sector with the creation
of Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). The assumption was
that companies would eagerly join these organisations, share what they
knew and consume the information shared by others. Yet, more than twenty
years after the concept was formalised into national legislation, many
sectors are just now forming an ISAC and, even in the most successful of
them, the percentage of participants that actively share information is
widely understood within the industry to remain low. [Public sector
efforts to share information with]{.underline} the [private sector have
suffered]{.underline} analogous problems. The US government created the
Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) programme as a free service for
general businesses, but few organisations have signed up and even fewer
contribute to the programme (Marks, 2018). This is unsurprising if we
look at what is being shared[; a US government report from 2018
suggested that]{.underline} just [two or three out of the 11,447
indicators submitted to AIS]{.underline} by the Department of Homeland
Security [were]{.underline} 'malicious and [related to cyber
incidents]{.underline} \[... while\] many of [the indicators received
were false]{.underline} positives or redundant information' (DHS Office
of Inspector General, 2017: p. 15). The three examples highlight that
information sharing is difficult for a variety of reasons. Simply
[creating programmes and]{.underline} [establishing sharing mechanisms
is insufficient without addressing obstacles to sharing]{.underline}
actionable [information]{.underline}. [These include]{.underline}
underlying [factors]{.underline} such as [over-classification,
reputational risk,]{.underline} and [legal concerns]{.underline}, [as
well a]{.underline}s operational [hurdles around validation,
standardisation, timeliness, and automation]{.underline} (Zibak &
Simpson, 2019).

#### NATO should increase their information sharing among organizations -- organizations can develop better practices and defensive measures 

**Daniel & Kenway '20** (Michael Daniel currently serves as President
and CEO of the non-profit Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA). Joshua Kenway is

Fellow with the Algorithmic Justice League. "Repairing the Foundation:

The new information sharing presumptions proposed in this
chapter---careful consideration of information type and relevance,
comparative advantage in information production, how to overcome
existing context-specific bar- 188 riers, and [how to create and
maintain trust---make]{.underline} the [cyber threat information sharing
landscape]{.underline} far [more complex]{.underline} than most people
envision. Yet, this very complexity provides an opportunity for
simplification: rather than everyone trying to share everything all the
time, [organizations can concentrate]{.underline} on [the information
types most relevant to them]{.underline}. [Information sharing
architectures, policies]{.underline}, and [systems should assist
organizations]{.underline} in focusing their information sharing
activities. Although identifying all the implications is beyond the
scope of this chapter, some more prominent ones are worthy of mention.
[Few organizations will share every type of cyber threat
information]{.underline}. Most organizations should focus on the types
of information most relevant to their business model. For example, under
this paradigm[, only organizations with strong technical capabilities
would share technical cyber threat information]{.underline}: cyber
security providers, telecommunications companies, Internet Service
Providers (ISPs), Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs), and large,
multinational companies in critical industries. [Government agencies
would focus less on producing stand-alone technical
indicators]{.underline} of compromise (IOCs), which industry has in
abundance, [and more on combining]{.underline} that [information with
strategic and tactical warning]{.underline} about specific threats,
since their comparative advantage lies in their intelligence and law
enforcement capabilities. Most citizens, [businesses and organizations
would]{.underline} primarily [consume information about best practices
and defensive measures]{.underline}. [The focus of information sharing
programs should change]{.underline}. Since most [organizations do not
need to produce]{.underline} or [consume technical cyber threat
information]{.underline}, government [cyber security initiatives should
reflect this]{.underline}. These p[rograms should]{.underline} instead
[encourage]{.underline} most [organizations to hire a cyber security
vendor]{.underline} or MSSP. Those [service providers would
consume]{.underline} the [technical, contextual, vulnerability, and
exploitation information]{.underline} and use it [to make security
adjustments]{.underline} such as updating blacklists or prioritizing
patches. Most organizations would primarily consume updates to best
practice and strategic or tactical warnings. This change would make
information sharing programmed more relevant and cost-effective.
[Information sharing programs need to build trust.]{.underline} Since
trust is a key component for effective information sharing, programs,
structures, and architectures need to build trust over time. [Policies
and structures should include operational processes designed to enhance
confidence and trust]{.underline} when personal rapport among
stakeholders may be lacking, particularly when programs are starting
(see Sauerwein et al., 2017; Sillaber et al., 2016; Vázquez et al.,
2012; Wagner et al., 2019). For example, CTA's information sharing rules
specify the nature and scope of the sharing commitment, how [members
should handle shared information, and what enforcement mechanisms and
penalties]{.underline} will be applied for violating those rules. Such
[clarity and consistency help new members trust]{.underline} that [other
members]{.underline} will treat their information properly. 189
Information sharing products can incorporate more than one information
type. Since the different information types are interdependent, any
given sharing product can contain more than one type. For example, [CTA
members share technical indicators and tactical context]{.underline}
(and occasionally attribution) through the same automated system and
standard format (Cyber Threat Alliance, 2020). A more
[rigorous]{.underline} conceptual [framework for information sharing
does not require a rigid division among]{.underline} the [information
types]{.underline} from a software or process flow perspective. Reducing
the number of organizations expected to share technical information
would make achieving speed and scale easier. [Abandoning the idea that
all organizations]{.underline} everywhere [should engage in technical
cyber threat information sharing makes overcoming]{.underline} the
[barriers to technical sharing easier]{.underline}. [Under this
assumption, the number of organizations with]{.underline} the
combination of [willingness, relevance, and capability]{.underline} [to
engage in technical cyber threat sharing decrease]{.underline}s to a
large but manageable number (Aspen Cybersecurity Group, 2018). At this
size, having most of these organizations participating in formal
information sharing groups becomes a reasonable goal. The information
sharing burden would decrease while the value would go up, increasing
the likelihood that organizations voluntarily participate in such
activities. By focusing sharing activities on the most relevant
information types, the time and monetary investment for most
organizations would decrease. At the same time, the connection between
shared information and the organization's mission or business model
would become clearer, thereby increasing its value, and making that
value easier to assess. [The decreased burden and increased value would
expand the number of organizations]{.underline} that participate in
sharing activities. Additional standard formats for non-technical
information types would emerge, along with systems to share those
formats with increasing degrees of automation. On the technical side,
several standard formats now facilitate automated information sharing,
such as the STIX (MITRE Corporation, 2012) and MITRE's Adversarial
Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) frameworks (MITRE
Corporation, 2020). More [rigorously dividing cyber threat
information]{.underline} into different types [would encourage other
formats to emerge and organizations to adopt them]{.underline}. Standard
formats make consumption of information easier for the recipient.
[Increased automation would increase speed and scale]{.underline},
making sharing more effective. Effective cyber threat information
sharing requires planning, long-term investment, and sustained
commitment. For example, technical cyber threat information sharing is
not merely a matter of adopting a technical standard and installing
software. It takes engineering and analytic time on an ongoing basis as
well as maintenance of the technology and processes. Similarly,
[consuming cyber security best practices]{.underline} is not a [one-time
endeavor]{.underline}; organization's must incorporate regular review
and implementation into their business processes. Absent a long-term
commitment from organizational 190 leadership, sharing usually withers
after an initial burst of enthusiasm. Cyber security should take on the
same status as other business enablers, such as accounting, legal
affairs, and communications; like these areas, cyber security should be
a function that all organization's budget for and sustain over the
long-term.

#### Rebuilding information networks through organized sharing is vital -- effective information sharing shields from cyberattacks

**Daniel & Kenway '20** (Michael Daniel currently serves as President
and CEO of the non-profit Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA). Joshua Kenway is

Fellow with the Algorithmic Justice League. "Repairing the Foundation:
How Cyber Threat Information Sharing Can Live Up to its Promise and
Implications for NATO," in *Cyber Threats and NATO 2030: Horizon

These incorrect assumptions have undermined information sharing as an
effective tool against cyber threats, yet policies, structures, and
processes must be based on assumptions about the overall environment in
order to function. As a replacement for the faulty assumptions explained
above, this chapter proposes four alternative presumptions to enable
effective information sharing. [First, cyber threat information consists
of multiple information types across different levels, with distinct
value to different consumers, meaning that information sharing needs to
be tailored and nuanced. Second, for this reason, relevance and
comparative advantage should drive sharing activities. Third, effective
information sharing efforts must overcome context-specific technical,
economic, legal, and cultural barriers; and fourth, trust is a necessary
component of information sharing.]{.underline} The rest of this section
will explore these alternative presumptions in greater detail. A. Types
of Cyber Threat Information Chismon and Ruks (2015) assembled a useful
taxonomy of cyber information categories based on the kind of decisions
the information informs. A modified version of their taxonomy is shown
in Table I. As detailed in Table I, different categories of information,
from technical to strategic, are intended for different consumers.
However, [information across the four levels---technical, tactical,
operational, and strategic---is interrelated.]{.underline} For example,
technical and tactical information can be combined to generate
operational cyber threat information to improve organisational
understanding of an impending attacker's methods and capabilities
(Chismon & Ruks, 2015). Similarly, post-incident analysis of technical
cyber threat information often provides the foundation for the
implementation of a tactical level decision. A holistic assessment of
technical, tactical, and operational inputs drives the output of
strategic cyber threat information. Despite these complex relationships,
this taxonomy provides a useful way to think about cyber threat
information and is indicative of why technical data-sharing should not
be the sole focus of information sharing programmes. Smaller or less
mature organisations are unlikely to find much utility in technical or
tactical information sharing, while even larger organisations may miss
out on key operational or strategic information insights if they focus
exclusively on the technical information. For this reason, the [Cyber
Threat Alliance (CTA), which includes established cyber security vendors
and related enterprises, shares a total of ten types of actionable cyber
threat information across these four categories, as recalled by the
authors and detailed in Table II.]{.underline} Understanding the value
of these various forms of cyber threat information requires taking a
more mature and nuanced view than the simplistic assumption that more
information sharing means better security. This expanded conceptual
framework for cyber threat information sharing reflects the diversity of
information that industry leaders already know must be shared to
strengthen defences. Each type informs a different aspect of cyber
security and has a different value in different situations. [Broad
adoption of this (still high-level) extension to the framework provided
by Chismon and Ruks (2015) would enable cyber security practitioners to
develop more nuanced and useful policies for information
sharing.]{.underline} B. Relevance and Comparative Advantage in
Information Sharing In other disciplines, from finance to health to
politics to sports, organisations do not produce and consume the same
information equally. Instead, wide variation occurs based on relevance
to business models, missions, and perceived benefits. Cyber security
practitioners and policymakers should expect cyber threat information
sharing to behave similarly. [Different organisations should produce and
consume different types of information based on two principles:
relevance and comparative advantage.]{.underline} These two concepts
should drive who should be sharing what information with whom, in what
detail, and at what periodicity. 1) Relevance of Information Companies,
non-profit organisations, and government agencies all have goals or
missions and employ specific business models to achieve those goals.
Information sharing should relate directly to an organisation's goals
and business model. [Thus, a cyber security vendor should share
technical cyber threat information at speed and at scale continuously
because it is directly relevant to their business model.]{.underline}
Conversely, a medium-sized manufacturer primarily needs strategic and
operational level cyber threat information--- strategic warnings, best
practices, and tactical warnings (e.g., if a government learns that the
business or its industry is being targeted)---all of which need only to
be updated when a change has occurred. Technical cyber threat
information provided at scale to this business would simply not be
useful. 2) Comparative Advantage of Information Sharing Even if some
organisations can produce certain information types, others might be
more efficient at that work. For example, although governments can use
their intelligence and law enforcement capabilities to collect, process,
and produce technical cyber threat information, they do not have a
comparative advantage in that information type. Private sector companies
can perform that function just as efficiently. However, governments have
a comparative advantage in other categories, such as attribution of
cyber attacks, strategic warnings, and tactical warnings, which benefit
from nation-state-level intelligence capabilities and authorities. As in
other activities, the principle of comparative advantage should
determine which organisations should be collecting, processing, sharing,
and consuming different types of information. C. Technical, Economic,
Legal and Cultural Barriers At first glance, the barriers inhibiting
information sharing seem quite varied. However, a closer review shows
they fall into four categories: technical, economic, legal, and
cultural. While their specific manifestations and relative significance
will vary across sharing contexts, these barriers can combine in various
ways to create a formidable obstacle to sharing. Technical barriers
prevent information from moving rapidly at scale or in easily consumable
formats. For example, inconsistent definitions and terminology and
difficulty in achieving interoperability and automation remain
significant obstacles (Zibak & Simpson, 2019). In turn, these barriers
often inhibit the usability or reliability of shared information (ENISA,
2017). Economic barriers stem from the inability to identify a clear
return on investment from sharing activities. Organisations 'participate
in sharing networks when their return is more than the cost to
participate' (Vázquez et al., 2012: p. 432). This problem can be
compounded by first-mover disadvantage, given that 'establishing threat
intelligence sharing infrastructure is expensive ... \[while\] in the
long run, intelligence sharing could help bring down the overall
security cost' (Zibak & Simpson, 2019: p. 7). Absent a clear and
immediate prospect of a return on investment, proponents often have
difficulty making the business case to establish, invest in or sustain
sharing activities. Legal barriers come from uncertainty about what
information can be shared under what circumstances or unanswered
questions about liability, fines, or prosecution. These uncertainties
deter organisations from sharing. Privacy laws can hinder sharing by
inadvertently classifying certain cyber threat information as private
and thereby limiting how it can be used or distributed (Panda Security,
2018). These legal concerns require sharing organisations to undertake
extensive consideration of their potential implications (Borden et al.,
2018; Albakri et al., 2019). Finally, cultural barriers can also impede
sharing (Luiijf & Kernkamp, 2015). For cyber security companies, it can
be hard to overcome the idea that retaining unique data yields a
competitive advantage. For other organisations, it can be hard to
overcome sentiments such as 'no one would target me', 'cyber security is
too complex for executives and non-technical employees to understand',
or 'falling victim to hackers is inevitable, so why bother?' For
governments, long-standing views about the appropriate respective roles
of the public and private sectors get in the way of cooperation and
sharing. The good news is that, over the last twenty years,
practitioners have developed ways to overcome these barriers. The bad
news is that none of these methods is frictionless or cost-free. For
example, adopting technical standards for information sharing may
require organisations to adjust business processes or infrastructure;
high initial costs may need to be met with loans that are paid back by
future sharing participants; legal consultations may be needed to shape
sharing rules; and reluctant executives may need the benefits of
information sharing to be explained in bottom-line terms. Across the
board, information sharing requires organisations to expend resources,
either money or time. These costs can decrease but do not disappear.
Yet, to be worthwhile, information sharing needs to be sustained and
organisations have to pay a long-term, regular cost for engaging in
information sharing activities. This requirement, in turn, means that
information sharing requires incentives to achieve the scope, scale, and
speed required for effective cyber defence. Such incentives can range
from the individual (avoiding the costs of a cyber incident) to the
public (government grants) to the avoidance of sticks (fines or
penalties for not engaging in appropriate sharing). Regardless,
information sharing laws, policies, programmes, and structures should
assume that information sharing is resource-heavy and requires sustained
investment to occur. D. Trust as a Necessary Component of Information
Sharing Experience from previous initiatives and programmes demonstrates
that information sharing only occurs when the providers and recipients
have a degree of trust. As noted by Wagner et al. (2018), trust 'plays a
critical role in sharing' (p. 5). The European Network Information
Agency (ENISA) observes that in situations where trust between members
of the community is diminishing or non-existent the value of information
shared is undermined (ENISA, 2013). For information sharing to work, it
is necessary to 'foster confidence for stakeholders that the provided
information will be acted upon as intended' (Wagner et al., 2018: p. 5).
Information providers have to understand who will receive their
information, what they will do with it, and what level of information
sharing-related risk to expect, while information recipients want to
know where the information came from and its reliability. To reach this
level of confidence, information sharing organisations should 'provide
control mechanisms to specify what information is shared, how much of it
and with whom' (Sauerwein et al., 2017: p. 845). According to ENISA
(2012, cited by Vázquez et al., 2012: p. 433), the use of intentionally
carefully designed trust-building mechanisms, such as 'the policies,
membership rules, requirement for security clearance and interaction
type' can be beneficial in the context of information sharing and will
support the creation of trust. Absent trust, information sharing will
not occur no matter what structures and incentives are put in place.
Trust does not require that the participants all like each other, nor
does it mean they share everything. Trust means that participants have a
reasonable belief that all other participants will adhere to the agreed
rules.

### S -- Transparency

#### Transparency is key- NATO should be clear about capabilities to bolster cyber deterrence

Susan **Davis 19**, general reporter of NATO, "NATO IN THE CYBER AGE:
STRENGTHENING SECURITY & DEFENCE, STABILISING DETERRENCE", STC,
https://www.nato-pa.int/download-file?filename=sites/default/files/2019-09/148%20STC%20Davis%20-%20NATO%20IN%20THE%20CYBER%20AGE%20-%20fall%20revision%20-%20clean%2011.9.19.pdf

[If]{.underline} one [only looked at the bad cyber news flooding media
outlets, policymakers could easily lose hope.]{.underline} However, this
report's in-depth analysis of Allied and NATO cyber strategies,
policies, and activities has shown that NATO is strengthening cyber
security, defence, and deterrence along all dimensions. The new cyber
space doctrine to be adopted by the end of 2019 will be another crucial
step. This progress should not lead to complacency. [NATO must
remain]{.underline} laser-[focused on cyber attacks]{.underline} [that
could threaten an Ally]{.underline}'s territorial integrity, political
independence, or national security and could, thus, lead them to invoke
Article 5. The NATO PA resolution the Rapporteur will present for
adoption at the Annual Session will represent the Assembly's overall
cyber policy recommendations. However, the Rapporteur would like to
propose the following set of recommendations for the Committee's
endorsement. She urges the Committee to closely follow progress on these
recommendations through all instruments available. [The Alliance should
continue to complement cyber security and defence measures with
strategies of cyber deterrence]{.underline}. **[NATO should maintain a
cyber deterrence policy of ambiguity]{.underline}**. [The Alliance
should not set thresholds for when a cyber attack is sufficiently
harmful]{.underline} to cross the threshold [to an armed
attack]{.underline} as well as for what the possible collective response
would be if that threshold was crossed. [Allies and NATO should continue
to signal their resolve and credibility to deter cyber
attacks]{.underline}. [NATO should therefore remain as transparent as
possible when it comes to its cyber capabilities.]{.underline} In areas
where public disclosure is not an option, communicating with potential
opponents through non-public channels should happen as frequently as
possible.[The Alliance should]{.underline} continue to seek to [reduce
escalatory risks]{.underline} through clear diplomatic messaging and
engagement, a [high level of transparency on cyber capabilities and
policies, and support to norm-development and confidence-building
measures in cyber space.]{.underline}

### S -- Public-Private Info

#### NATO must strengthen public private partnerships and information sharing to counter emerging cyber threats and enhance deterrence

**Lete & Dege '17** \[Bruno & Daiga; 2017; senior fellow or security and
defense policy in GMF's security office; trainee in office, "NATO
cybersecurity: a roadmap to resilience,
<https://www.gmfus.org/sites/default/files/NATO%2520Cybersecurity_edited.pdf>\]

The core of NATO cybersecurity efforts lie at the member-state level.
[NATO is responsible for protecting its own institutional information
and communication systems, but it has little say in coordinating how
member states develop their national cyber defense
capabilities]{.underline}. Despite having signed the Cyber Defense
Pledge at the Warsaw NATO Summit, many member states still struggle to
implement and evaluate their national cyber-security plans. [As a result
NATO's efforts at developing uniform, alliance-wide cybersecurity are
undermined]{.underline} by significant inconsistencies across the
national level of the member states and NATO's collective security and
deterrence in cyberspace still show serious vulnerabilities against the
backdrop of a growing number of attacks. For NATO to operationalize
cyberspace as a domain of NATO defense policy and planning --- as was
agreed at the NATO Warsaw Summit --- the Alliance should have
authorizations from member states to do more than just provide advice,
expertise, training, or education. Similar to how NATO coordinates
[Allied military forces in the conventional domain, NATO could also be
asked to evaluate how member states can develop, synergize, and
complement their mutual national cyber defenses. At a minimum, NATO
should develop standards and better indicators that allow a standardized
measurement of a nation's annual progress --- and should be tasked with
testing and measuring members' capabilities annually.]{.underline} To
achieve this objective, a [strong cooperation with the European Union is
essential]{.underline}. NATO and the EU could work together to design
minimum cybersecurity requirements and benchmarks that would also be
adopted by the European Defense Agency. Rapid Assessment and
Decision-Making Tools The scale, speed, and intensity of today's
cyber-attacks demand a new approach to respond at the political,
military, and civilian level. To develop a rapid decision-making process
when facing a cyber-attack NATO can take a few effective measures across
its organization. First, more resources must be allocated to accurately
and quickly detect and define hostile cyber actions. Further work on
indications, warnings, and situational awareness is critical. In this
context, NATO's various civil and military intelligence units, inter
alia, could have a useful role. In addition, the Supreme Allied
Commander Europe (SACEUR) could be granted more powers by the North
Atlantic Council in authorizing some of the preparatory procedures. [At
the same time, NATO headquarters should increase the number of exercises
that test rapid decisions-making procedures in complex and demanding
cyber crisis-conflict scenarios. Much can also be done at the
member-state level.]{.underline} Allies and willing partners should
continue to work on improving and updating threat assessments, and
facilitating closer intelligence cooperation. In this light, Allies
should identify information sharing as a clear requirement and task.
NATO could also intensify its interaction with national intelligence
services and establish supply chain management partnerships with
national industries. Cyber threats come in the form of networks and it
takes a similarly well-organized network of international and
cross-sector cooperation to defeat those threats. [Common Rules of
Engagement NATO has not commonly defined the circumstances, conditions,
degree, and manner in which the use of force may apply if one of its
member states suffers a cyber-attack. Triggering the authorization to
use force in the context of Article 5 may be more obvious if a member
state faces a large-scale, devastating cyber-attack where the source of
the attack can be clearly attributed.]{.underline} But the need is much
more urgent to define when and how NATO must respond against the
day-to-day cyber intrusions that fall below the threshold of being
perceived as a clear act of aggression. [NATO policy still allows for
too many gray zones]{.underline} that are being exploited by adversaries
who are clever enough not to cross a line that would trigger a common
response from the Alliance. Cybersecurity incidents like the alleged
Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee's emails show that the
United States and the NATO Allies are still unclear about the conditions
and manner to respond in cyberspace. The Tallinn Manual published by the
NATO CCDCoE offers a set of guidelines on how states can define rules of
engagement, countermeasures, retaliation operations, and other forms of
response within the context of the international law if they are to face
an act of cyber aggression. But NATO is still far removed from having
adopted a common view and interpretation on the subject. The North
Atlantic Council would still need to assess each individual cyber-attack
case by case without the support of standard measurement tools and
indicators that can help NATO formulate a proportionate political or
military response. [As more cyber policies and laws are taking shape,
NATO could demonstrate political, military, and intellectual leadership
by clearly defining rules of engagement in cyberspace.]{.underline}
Consider Offensive Cybersecurity NATO now recognizes a serious
cyber-attack as a potential Article 5 trigger. But the doctrine and
crisis management conditions enshrined in NATO's cyber policy puts the
emphasis on a defensive posture only. As such, the Alliance fails to
recognize cyber as a force multiplier that could be of importance to the
defense of NATO nations. Russia for instance considers offensive cyber
capabilities to be an integral part of its military power and especially
as a way to make up for its relative lack of conventional forces
compared to NATO. The rise in connectivity, smartphone proliferation,
cloud computing, growth of application development, and other
technological advances open new avenues to attackers and force defenders
to cover an ever-increasing number of fields. In the long run, NATO's
defensive approach is not sustainable[. It is time for NATO to start a
debate on offensive cybersecurity and map the feasibility of
coordinating counter strikes, and to establish a significant offensive
cyber capability.]{.underline} NATO could center this debate on
projecting offensive cyber warfare capabilities as a means of
deterrence, similar to the perceived value of nuclear weapons to deter
attacks against NATO. Offensive security will allow the Alliance to
better control the virtual battlefield. There are valuable cyber
capabilities worth attaining, including the ability to conduct
reconnaissance and surveillance, intercept communications, or deny
resources and access. NATO may find increasing support to have a
conversation on offensive cyber security with its allies. As member
states are increasingly preoccupied with defense and deterrence issues
in cyber-space they will show more receptivity to cooperation with NATO
on developing centralized offensive cyber capabilities. NATO and Cyber
Industry Cooperation Cybersecurity is largely market-driven. Government
intelligence capabilities increasingly find it hard to keep up with the
requirements for combating the surge in cyber threats. [NATO should play
a crucial role in facilitating contacts between those member states that
seek stronger links with the private sector and encourage the role that
industry can play in cyber threat deterrence and intelligence
sharing.]{.underline} Flagship initiatives, such as the NATO Industry
Cyber Partnership, are important steps in that direction but [there is
still a need to build more access and trust between NATO governments and
industry]{.underline}. [Educating member states]{.underline} and partner
nations [about the role of the private sector in cybersecurity is
key.]{.underline} [To make the partnership with the industry more
effective NATO could play a more important role in mapping and
evaluating what kind of cyber defense technologies and intelligence
gathering methods the private sector offers, share lessons
learned]{.underline} with the member states [and encourage capitals to
integrate the best practices into]{.underline} capabilities,
[policy]{.underline}, and implementation planning. [NATO can also play
an essential role in improving communications and information sharing
between the private and the public sectors]{.underline}. More can be
done at the NATO level to identify what kind of information between
governments and companies can or cannot be shared, [to develop
standardized methods and formats for information sharing, and to
encourage the use of automated platform capabilities to share this
information quickly]{.underline}. Build a Robust Public Diplomacy
Campaign The first frontier of cyber defense is the individual. Citizens
who are digitally empowered, cyber aware, and cyber educated will
display a more responsible behavior and automatically increase NATO's
collective security in cyberspace. NATO needs a narrative on why
cybersecurity matters beyond public belief that a major cyber-attack is
improbable. What can NATO do in cyberspace that national security
agencies cannot do? Which level of cybersecurity is needed rather than
which one we can afford? NATO societies should be exposed to debate
through parliaments, media, nongovernmental organizations, and academia.
Externally, the Alliance must adapt to the reality that countries
hostile to NATO will continue to use their own cyber capabilities and
massive state propaganda organizations to attack NATO systems and
discredit everything the Alliance does. NATO has to be able to engage in
and win this information war at the elite decision-maker and
opinion-former levels rather than simply raise awareness of its
existence and activities among a global public.

#### Partnership programs work but are limited---Nato should prioritize partner programs essential for security cooperation

Lisa **Aronsson and** Brett **Swaney 21**;

June 14, 2021; Lisa Aronsson is a research fellow, and Brett Swaney is
an assistant research fellow, at the Institute for National Strategic
Studies at National Defense University.; Atlantic Council; "Three
priorities for NATO partnerships in a contested world";

[NATO's Partnerships programs]{.underline} have provided options for
cooperation with non-member states for more than twenty-five years.
They've [prove]{.underline}n remarkably flexible and [adaptable, serving
partners' as well as NATO's evolving interests. They helped
consolidate]{.underline} democratic [transitions in Europe, provided
support for NATO]{.underline}-led missions and [operations, and
strengthened collective defense]{.underline} and deterrence. Through
Partnerships for Peace, [NATO offers]{.underline} a menu of [more than
1,400 activities]{.underline} open to all forty partner states around
the world. [Partners choose]{.underline} the scope, focus, and intensity
of their [cooperation]{.underline} with NATO. The arrangement has
appealed to a diverse group of states, which NATO organized into the
Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the Mediterranean Dialogue, the
Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, and Partners Across the Globe. [In the
current]{.underline} environment, however, there is mounting pressure to
adapt partnerships to ensure they continue to support NATO's interests.
The patchwork of geographic groupings is increasingly incongruent with
today's challenges. [The groups]{.underline} have generally failed to
promote security cooperation or political consultations at the regional
level[.]{.underline} They [have]{.underline} also [inhibited NATO's
ability to set priorities or steer cooperation with
partners]{.underline} towards its own objectives. Moreover, the
activities that partner states value most---[capacity-building and
interoperability,]{.underline} or the ability to link up their forces
with NATO's and act coherently---[remain underfunded]{.underline}. As
NATO reorients to incorporate China into a broader strategic calculus,
how can NATO preserve what works for partners and adapt its partnership
policies without defaulting to a one-size-fits-all approach? [First,
NATO should ensure that capacity-building and]{.underline} additional
resilience support remain priorities. [China]{.underline} is using its
[economic leverage]{.underline} to expand its security cooperation, and
Beijing, along with Russia, [is undermining Alliance
credibility]{.underline}. Some partners have become testing grounds for
hybrid attacks. [Capacity-building helps counter that by strengthening
partner institutions]{.underline} and resilience, and a sense of shared
security. The Partnership Interoperability Initiative protects
hard-earned interoperability with some partners, and the Defence and
Related Security Capacity Building (DCB) Initiative already supports
Georgia, Iraq, Jordan, Moldova, and Tunisia. The NATO Parliamentary
Assembly has recommended more attention to Ukraine, the Western Balkans,
and areas with weak institutions or where democracy is undermined. Civil
emergency planning through NATO's Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response
Coordination Centre is also valuable. [Capacity-building
programs]{.underline} are also a path to NATO interoperability for
partners, which [remains a major driver for cooperation]{.underline}
with NATO---even among neutral countries that may never contribute to a
NATO military operation. This is because NATO provides internationally
recognizable military standards and the ability to plug-and-play into
European Union (EU), United Nations, or other multilateral operations.
[NATO interoperability]{.underline} certification is in demand among
partners, as are its robust [programs]{.underline} for education,
training, and exercises. These activities [promote defense and security
sector reform]{.underline}, strengthening institutions and transparency.
NATO should work to overcome constraints on partner participation in
exercises, especially for Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New
Zealand. Cooperative security depends on NATO's centrality as an
international standard-setter, a position that cannot be taken for
granted. [Second, NATO should accelerate internal
consultations]{.underline} on China and bring partners in early and
often on topics of mutual concern, [ensuring]{.underline} NATO
[decision-making is informed]{.underline} by partners in the
[earliest]{.underline} stages. This has worked well with Sweden and
Finland, but it should work better with NATO's Indo-Pacific partner
states, those along China's Belt and Road Initiative, and those with
high-end cyber or space interests. The old geographic boundaries are
being redrawn around these issues. NATO should work to better define
mutual expectations and goals with partners and leverage natural
groupings around cross-cutting challenges, perhaps by expanded use of
30+N arrangements or revised "framework nation" models, to bypass the
gridlock of regional mechanisms. Daniel Hamilton of Johns Hopkins'
School of Advanced International Studies recommends offering [Enhanced
Opportunities Partnerships]{.underline} to Japan and South Korea in an
effort to [improve interoperability]{.underline}, information-sharing,
and political consultation[. Finally, NATO should forge new frontiers
in]{.underline} science and technology ([S&T) cooperation]{.underline}
with partner states and the EU. The Alliance has interests [in achieving
dominance in]{.underline} Emerging Disruptive Technologies
([EDTs]{.underline}) and in setting norms [and]{.underline} standards
for their [incorporation into militaries]{.underline}. NATO boasts
renowned research universities and innovation hubs, but so do partner
states like Sweden, Finland, Japan, and South Korea, for example. [NATO
should expand support for S&T collaboration with these partners and
others through the Science for Peace and Security Programme
(SPS).]{.underline} NATO should also explore other avenues to expand
research collaboration with select partners and share lessons learned
from public-private partnerships. [Partners already stand
shoulder-to-shoulder]{.underline} with NATO [on
cybersecurity]{.underline}, for example[, and should be]{.underline}
[brought into S&T Board]{.underline} and other discussions where
possible. A more ambitious NATO-EU relationship in this area would be a
force multiplier. NATO also has a related interest in leading the global
mission to ensure that EDTs are integrated into modern militaries in
ways that are consistent with its values and with the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and United Nations Sustainable Development
Goals. So far, the Alliance's Advisory Group reports that NATO's EDT
strategies are focused internally on harnessing member states' strengths
and building a cohesive Alliance innovation ecosystem that is buttressed
by talent development and novel financing initiatives. NATO is expected
to release an artificial intelligence (AI) and big data strategy this
summer, the first of seven EDT strategies, and it should outline a
broader vision that links NATO's innovation ecosystem with those of its
partners. Partners and other like-minded states around the world are
already looking to NATO for guidance on AI, codes of conduct for
military activity in outer space, and standard-setting for
cybersecurity, for example. Looking ahead, NATO partnerships will remain
demand-driven, but they should adapt to serve NATO as it grapples with
China's rise while still addressing myriad other challenges. The next
Strategic Concept will update the Alliance's approach to cooperative
security. NATO should set a higher level of ambition for partnerships
and fund them so that they continue to appeal to such a diverse group of
states around the world. Expanding capacity-building to include more
resilience support remains paramount, but accelerating political
consultations and forging ahead with ambitious S&T cooperation are also
important. [Failure]{.underline} in these areas [risks]{.underline}
allowing [NATO partnerships]{.underline} to languish and fade into
[irrelevance]{.underline} at a time when the Euro-Atlantic community
most needs a wider network of partners to face a contested world order.

c\. **[Bolster Deterrence and Defense Against Hybrid
Threats]{.underline}** Advancing the Alliance's ability to deter and
defend also means prioritizing ways to deal with unconventional
conflicts that might hover below the Alliance's Article 5 mutual defense
threshold. [These include]{.underline} some types of
[cyberattacks]{.underline}, energy intimidation, financial
destabilization, [election interference, and dis- and misinformation
campaigns]{.underline}. NATO's Strategic Communications Center of
Excellence Command (CoE STRATCOM) needs creative new steps to detect and
counter false information, including real time alerts to Allies on
emerging threats and recommended countermeasures. Many relevant
competences in Europe fall to national civilian authorities, to the
private sector, or to the EU. [While NATO can lead in developing and
adapting cyber-deterrence and counter-disinformation guidelines and
capabilities, better EU-NATO coordination and planning, will be
needed.]{.underline} [There is greater need to align and intensify
action]{.underline} via the Helsinki-based European Center for
Countering Hybrid Threats, ensuring there are operational feedin loops
to NATO and EU decision-making. [NATO and the defense establishments of
its members are under constant attack from cyber hackers seeking to
penetrate their information systems, extract data and plant viruses that
could be used against allies]{.underline}. [Digital disruptors target
NATO systems]{.underline}, the operational cyber networks needed to
execute military missions, and an extensive number of civilian networks
that are essential to critical societal functions. [Allies have
determined that some types of cyber attacks could trigger Article 5 of
the North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline}. In the 2016 Cyber Defense
Pledge, allies affirmed their individual responsibilities under Article
3 of the Treaty to enhance their cyber defenses. [The 2030 Reflection
Group highlighted the need to develop both greater collective defense
capacity in cyberspace and a more robust consultation framework to
facilitate collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative
security in the cyber domain]{.underline}.20 These concerns were largely
echoed by allies in the 2021 Brussels Summit Communiqué.21
**[Nonetheless, allies have been reluctant to organize operational
capabilities via NATO]{.underline}**, and only five member states have
announced that they will make sovereign cyber effects available to the
Alliance.22 [Limited measures thus far undertaken include deployment of
cyber defense elements with NATO response forces, where continuous
coordination and planning of cyber operations is essential.]{.underline}
NATO has also gained initial experience through the SHAPE Cyber
Operations Center (CyOC).

Box 1. **[Enhance Cybersecurity Through "Safe-to-Fail"
Principles]{.underline}** [If NATO is to effectively
address]{.underline} the broad range of [security
challenges]{.underline} emanating from the cyber domain, [the Alliance
could complement its current collective defense efforts by incorporating
**cyber resilience** and "safe-to-fail" principles into the new
Strategic Concept]{.underline}.23 [Until now, NATO efforts to
operationalize collective defense have relied primarily on 'fail-deadly'
and 'fail-safe' logics in cyberspace]{.underline}. Should deterrence
fail, 'fail-deadly' means the Alliance responds with the use of deadly
force, whereas 'fail-safe' efforts are intended to ensure that the
Alliance and its members can continue to operate safely and securely in
the cyber domain.24 [While these two approaches are important, they only
apply to a limited band of the full spectrum of threats presented by the
cyber domain.]{.underline} [**Fail-deadly** deterrence]{.underline} is
only likely to succeed in preventing adversarial states from cyber
operations that reach the threshold of armed conflict with destructive
physical effects that are quickly attributable.25 It [is]{.underline}
likely to be [**ineffective** with state or non-state actors inflicting
lower threshold attacks for which attribution is difficult.]{.underline}
[These considerations are further complicated by the **differing legal
restraints individual allies place on offensive cyber
operation**s]{.underline}. [**Fail-safe** measures also face several
challenges]{.underline}. Given the sheer quantity of daily network
probes experienced by NATO and individual member states, [it is unlikely
that every intrusion can be successfully countered]{.underline} or even
identified. Highly sophisticated cyber operations are also likely to
evade most defensive measures. Moreover, computers and systems
increasingly rely on commercially available products and non-NATO-based
manufacturers. [Defensive strategies will have limited utility if
hardware or software components have been preloaded with
malware]{.underline}.26 **[The Alliance]{.underline}** and its members
[**need to account for a variety of threats and scenarios for which
fail-deadly and fail-safe strategies prove ineffective---**such as
ransomware attacks, distributed denials of service, exploitation of
digital supply chains, or operations conducted by non-state
actors]{.underline}. To withstand and bounce forward from such
disruptions, **[NATO should ensure that military cyber functions and
capabilities are 'safe-to-fail']{.underline}** \-- [that is, they can
fail in ways that do not remove their ability to recover at or above
original operating capacity]{.underline}. Incorporating safe-to-fail
principles would require the Alliance to fill out the full meaning of
Article 3, which is not limited to "self-help" but also includes "mutual
aid." [It would mean coordinating with the private sector and
de-conflicting economic prioritie]{.underline}s, as provided under
Article 2. [It would include developing metrics for assessing Allied
operational success in cyberspace, and horizon scanning for emerging
cyber technologies that could affect Alliance security.]{.underline}27

[The Strategic Concept should take NATO efforts further]{.underline}.
**[The United States might offer to be the framework nation in the next
evolution of NATO cyber operations planning and
coordination.]{.underline}** A full NATO Cyber Defense Forces
Headquarters (NCHQ) should be agreed, based on the proven NATO Special
Operations Forces Headquarters (NSHQ) model. [An NCHQ would improve
cooperation among allies and protect NATO's freedom of action in
cyberspace, strengthening deterrence]{.underline}. [Such a headquarters
should generate the necessary arrangements and readiness to allow
nations to plug their capabilities and produce cyber effects should
there be a collective decision to do so. It should act to achieve
consensus on issues of cyber deterrence, particularly whether individual
Alliance cyber defense capabilities alone are adequate or whether
capabilities are needed to effectively deter major strikes against NATO
networks, the networks of individual nations, or against the critical
infrastructures of allied societies (Box 1]{.underline}). It should be
linked to the EU's broader cyber toolbox.28

#### NATO must develop Resilient Cybersecurity Architectures and Active Cyber Defenses- they will make it more difficult for advisories to attack

https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/nato-needs-continuous-responses-in-cyberspace/

[First,]{.underline} [NATO should require the development]{.underline}
and implementation [of]{.underline} [resilient cybersecurity
architectures for itself, its members' forces, and its key critical
infrastructures]{.underline}. A resilient cybersecurity architecture
involves an integrated set of capabilities that work as a system to
reduce the disruptive effects of cyber adversaries. [Key elements of a
resilient architecture should include use of private sector cloud
technology; zero-trust architecture for effective access
management;]{.underline} development of secure hardware capabilities;
and machine-learning [and artificial-intelligence-augmented cyber
defenses]{.underline}. [This architecture]{.underline} also [needs to be
flexible to incorporate emerging technologies as they are
developed]{.underline}. NATO itself cannot develop such architectures.
It can, however, underscore their necessity and require its members to
do so, using the NATO Defense Planning Process (NDPP), acquisition
procedures, standards and targets, and innovation from Allied Command
Transformation to support a comprehensive research and development
effort. [In establishing requirements for these resilient architectures,
NATO must recognize that one size will not fit all.]{.underline} Not
only will requirements differ among military, government, and critical
infrastructures operators, but, as has been shown in the development of
autonomous vehicles and space capabilities, [there are a variety of
different approaches that may prove effective.]{.underline} In fact,
[having diversity within]{.underline} these [capabilities will increase
resilience]{.underline} [by complicating adversaries' abilities to
infiltrate and attack them.]{.underline} [Second, NATO]{.underline}, in
coordination with its nations, [should undertake active cyber
defense.]{.underline} Even the best exclusionary capabilities in a
cybersecurity resilient architecture can fail due to technical loopholes
or human error. As a result, [the Alliance needs "active cyber defenses"
that can create resilience even when an attacker has breached cyber
protections.]{.underline} These capabilities affect only those networks
in which operators and owners have installed them and are not for
offensive purposes. As the US National Security Agency explains, [key
elements of active defense capacities include "real-time
communications,...sensors that report data on the current state of the
network,]{.underline} sense-making analytics to understand the current
state, automated decision-making to decide how to react to current state
information, [and capabilities to act on those decisions to defend the
network."]{.underline} NATO should include such active defense
capabilities as a requirement of an overall resilient cybersecurity
architecture. As a key element of active cyber defense, [NATO must be
capable of hunting for adversaries within cyber systems critical to
defense.]{.underline} [The Alliance should develop highly capable expert
hunt teams to review system activities,]{.underline} detect anomalies,
[and defeat intruders]{.underline}, for example by deleting malware and
closing unnecessary ports. NATO can significantly enhance Allies' active
defense efforts by establishing an NDPP requirement for national
cybersecurity hunt teams, along with command arrangements for those
teams in both hybrid and Article 5 contingencies. [It should also
establish several NATO Standing Cybersecurity Hunt Teams that would
operate with the consent and active partnership of national governments
and critical infrastructure network operators.]{.underline} As Microsoft
has explained the role of hunt teams, [Standing Cybersecurity Hunt
Teams]{.underline}, acting in conjunction with national capabilities,
[can contest the continuous cyber campaigns of Russia and
China]{.underline}. According to the US Department of Homeland Security,
such hunt teams can conduct deep technical analyses of live networks to
identify "previously unobserved threats." Standing Cybersecurity Hunt
Teams, with a focus on active defense, would expand on the capabilities
of NATO's current Cyber Rapid Reaction teams which are limited in
numbers and operate reactively. While the cybersecurity of
infrastructure and government systems is a national responsibility, a
breach of cybersecurity at the national level can have collective
consequences. Standing Cybersecurity Hunt Teams can be a capability, as
well as connective tissue, to identify and mitigate cyber threats across
national boundaries and enhance NATO's collective defense. [Standing
Cybersecurity Hunt Teams would be able to utilize information and
experience gained from contesting Russian and Chinese cyber-attacks
against one ally in the defense of others. A Standing Cybersecurity Hunt
Team can also serve in a capacity-building role to help allied nations
develop their own cyber capabilities, for example, in conjunction with
the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence.]{.underline}

### S -- Unity

#### Data sharing is key to promoting NATO unity -- resolves longstanding challenges and reunites member states over common threats.

Sharing Systems Coming Soon". June 18, 2022.
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/new-nato-common-data-sharing-systems-coming-soon-203082\]

[**Interoperability** and rapid deployment reinforce one
another]{.underline}. [The more a multinational force is able to **share
sensitive information** in real-time using common standards, interfaces,
or interoperable data links, **the faster a NATO force can move into
position** and conduct joint multi-domain operations.]{.underline}
[**Improving interoperability has been a long-standing challenge** for
NATO forces]{.underline}. Radio frequencies need to be aligned,
[computing protocols need to **enable data exchanges**]{.underline}, and
datalinks between separate countries need to operate with interfaces to
ensure information transmission. [Common command and control
systems]{.underline}, fortified by uniform technical standards, [can
ensure NATO members are increasingly able to act seamlessly]{.underline}
in warfare formations [on the **eastern flank**]{.underline}. One clear
advantage to this effort can be found in the F-35 stealth fighter, as
the aircraft uses a common data link for all F-35s across multiple
nations. The F-35s Multifunction Advanced Datalink (MADL) enables F-35s
from any country to interact with and share information across a
multinational formation of fifth-generation aircraft. [The **alliance is
likely working to move beyond this existing synergy** and connect
drones, aircraft, ground vehicles, and surface ships from multiple
countries in real-time using a common framework.]{.underline} This would
allow an F-35 from Poland to send targeting detail to U.S. Abrams tanks
positioned to defend Finland or to NATO surface ships in the Baltic Sea
trying to disrupt Russian maritime supply lines. NATO will likely seek
to build upon the existing framework of its NATO Standardization
Agreement 4586 (STANAG 4586) to enable drones from different countries
to exchange information in a common format. [STANAG 4586 could perhaps
be upgraded to reduce latency, prevent hacking, or expanded to other
platforms using compatible technical standards, message formats, and
protocol.]{.underline} [**NATO's ability to rapidly respond** relies to
a large extent on the alliance's capacity for common command and control
and data exchange]{.underline}, or else forces from different member
nations will be alienated from one another in combat environments.
[Given the number of breakthroughs the U.S. military is achieving with
**joint information networking**]{.underline}, it makes sense that
Austin would [emphasize ongoing efforts to **extend** this kind of
real-time **connectivity** **among NATO members**]{.underline}.

#### Exposing Russian cyber campaigns alone is not enough- only persistent cooperation and coordination among NATO members can forge the political unity necessary to deter Russian attacks

EASTERN FLANK TO WESTERN ELECTIONS: RUSSIAN OPERATIONS AGAINST THE EU
AND NATO; The Center for European Policy Analysis;
https://cepa.org/the-evolution-of-russian-hybrid-warfare-eu-nato/

[The most immediate lesson for Western governments]{.underline} from the
U.S. elections in 2016 **[was not to be quiet about Russian influence
operations]{.underline}**. **[The biggest benefit of exposing Russian
operations is increasing public awareness of the threat and the
determination to devote sufficient time and resources to countering
it,]{.underline}** **[which will in the long run change the cost-benefit
calculus]{.underline}**.38 Moreover, Bellingcat's investigative
journalism has served to expose Russian intelligence operations and has
become a headache and source of embarrassment for the Russian
leadership.¶ Nonetheless, "[naming and shaming" should not be seen as
sufficient]{.underline} for deterring Russian operations. After the U.S.
elections in 2016, the poisoning of former Russian-British double agent
Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom in 2018, and the poisoning of
Navalny in August 2020, it has become clear that the Russian leadership
is not too worried about some of its high-profile operations becoming
known to the public. On the contrary, the Skripal poisoning was intended
to send a signal to other intelligence officers in Russia and also to
the West. As "Putin and his inner circle appear to believe that they are
in nothing less than a political war, \[naming and shaming\] will at
best influence tactics, not strategy."39¶ With the Russian leadership
committed to the idea that it is in a political war against the EU and
NATO[, more is needed]{.underline} than simply exposing its malign
behaviors. So far, the Western approach has been to primarily rely on
sanctions in lieu of stronger policy measures. Sanctions are an
alternative to escalation. They satisfy the urge to "do something"
rather than fix the underlying problem.40 Moreover, inflicting economic
pain is only effective to the extent that economic development is a
priority for the Russian leadership. Nonetheless, it is demonstrably
subordinate to regime security and great-power status.¶ The EU is
responsible for the political response to the challenge from Russia,
including sanctions, and has since 2014 taken a wide range of measures
to increase preparedness against hybrid threats. These include creating
sectoral strategies, establishing expert bodies (Hybrid Fusion Cell,
Center of Excellence for Hybrid Threats), creating information-sharing
mechanisms, conducting exercises and simulations, partnering with NATO,
and increasing investments in cyber defense.41 Most notably, the EU
adopted an Action Plan against Disinformation42 and set up an EU versus
Disinformation initiative in 2015. In July 2020, the EU also imposed its
first-ever sanctions (asset freeze and travel ban) in response to
cyberattacks on individual GRU officers and the responsible center at
the GRU.43¶ These are all important steps to improve the infrastructure,
but [the core problem for]{.underline} the EU and **[NATO is still
political and about unity]{.underline}**. Both the EU and [NATO have
viewed Russian hybrid warfare as more of a nuisance than a fundamental
challenge. NATO]{.underline} is primarily responsible for the military
instrument, but also **[has a key role maintaining political
unity]{.underline}**. The lack thereof was evident when Macron called
for a rapprochement with Russia in 2019 while failing to grasp the fact
that Russian aggression is premised on the predictability of the West to
always return to the negotiating table even though the fundamental
problem has not been addressed.¶ Indeed, between Russia's invasion of
Ukraine and Macron's call for better relations, Russia had not only
impacted the U.S. and French elections, it had also used chemical
weapons on NATO soil to try and assassinate Skripal, an attempt that
resulted in the death of a British citizen.44 [Western actions have
underlined that the West is unwilling to accept economic pain for
geopolitical gain, in a failure to invest more into]{.underline}
military and nonmilitary [capabilities]{.underline} or impose tougher
sanctions.¶ Governments alone cannot solve the problem of Russian
influence operations. Big technology companies provide an important
arena for these operations. These firms have come a long way since their
2016 laissez-faire approach to beefing up their defenses. Facebook is
now more aggressive about taking down coordinated inauthentic behavior,
Twitter has banned all political advertising, and Google, Facebook, and
Twitter have signed onto the EU's Code of Practice, which sets a wide
range of commitments, including transparency in political advertising
and the closure of fake accounts. However, [as methods for exposing
disinformation are disclosed, Russian strategists will seek to
circumvent them]{.underline}.45 [The task]{.underline} [for]{.underline}
the EU and NATO is [Sisyphean]{.underline}.¶ Just days before the 2020
U.S. elections, the New York Post ran a story based on leaked (or fake)
information against Biden. Twitter was quick to block the story, and
Facebook posted warning labels next to it.46 Regardless of the wisdom of
those actions, it does show the increased awareness of the big social
media companies that staying away from acting is not a strategy.¶
[Russia is constantly adapting its hybrid warfare in response to its
adversaries' actions and technological change.]{.underline} As automated
bots and hack-and-leak operations are exposed, Russian operations have
changed to create more organic-looking means of influence that blend
international and domestic issues.¶ [The key lesson for Russian
strategists so far has been that their operations carry low costs and
have potentially very high rewards. As long as this calculus remains in
place, these operations will continue]{.underline}. **[The political
unity of the West is fragile and already under great domestic strain ---
a reality that Russia seeks to amplify and exploit]{.underline}**.
**[The fundamental challenge for the West is maintaining political unity
to counter Russian operations and successfully deter the most
significant ones]{.underline}**, including election meddling or the use
of chemical weapons on NATO territory.¶ Many other operations, however,
such as [run-of-the-mill disinformation, cannot reasonably be
deterred]{.underline} given the Russian leadership's conviction that it
is in a political war with the West. [Such operations will need to be
countered with]{.underline} hardened defenses, public-private
**[cooperation, and dedication.]{.underline}**

### S -- Interoperability 

#### Interoperability is key to NATO's success- ensures efficient and precise action

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine highlights the need to speed up NATO
interoperability]{.underline}, he said. [The]{.underline} [ability for
weapons]{.underline} and other [military systems]{.underline} to
communicate [and share information among NATO allies is one of the most
important aspects for the alliance's success]{.underline} in future
fights, Burkhard said during a fireside chat hosted by the Center for
New American Security. [Collective interoperability is not currently the
standard]{.underline}, he noted. For example, Burkhard has witnessed
communication issues with the increased deployment of the F-35 joint
strike fighter into various NATO ally's air forces. "The F-35 is
designed as a very effective and efficient system," he said. "It has
great qualities, but its design is a very closed system and I think this
is a mistake." [NATO militaries must play a decisive role in ensuring
network interoperability standards across the alliance]{.underline}, he
added. [France is]{.underline} also [working to improve interoperability
within its own armed forces]{.underline} in an effort similar to the
U.S. Defense Department's joint all-domain command and control, or
JADC2, which aims to link sensors and shooters at the tactical edge.
[France's internal campaign to achieve interoperability]{.underline} is
part of its Scorpion program, which "[aims at digitalizing all land
forces in order to be able to extend information very quickly
and]{.underline} also i[mprove]{.underline} \[our\] [operational pace in
order to be able to impose our will on opponents]{.underline}," he said.
[A document]{.underline} --- Burkhard's Strategic Vision for 2030 ---
[is not unlike modernization plans made by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and]{.underline} the [U]{.underline}nited
[K]{.underline}ingdom [to move away from operations against nonstate
actors and prepare for potential conflict with adversaries such as China
and Russia]{.underline}. An exception the U.S. and U.K. militaries'
desires to shrink the size of its land forces. [France will]{.underline}
be [focus]{.underline}ing [its attention on upgrading its Army by the
year 2030]{.underline}, he noted. [This includes the development of two
new ground vehicles for the French army]{.underline} to replace the
service's aging vehicles and systems: the Griffon, a multi-role armored
vehicle, and the Jaguar, an armored reconnaissance and combat vehicle.
Burkhard said [the ability of these]{.underline} vehicles and other
**[new capabilities to connect and share information across domains is
"the true driver" for success]{.underline}**. [Russia's
operations]{.underline} --- which have not gone to Moscow's plans ---
[signal the true amounts of effort required for high-intensity
operations]{.underline}. "It doesn't mean that we are not able right now
ready to engage in a high-intensity conflict, but not with all the
assets that were identified or the level of training we \[expected\] to
reach by 2030," he said.

#### NATO must strengthen its threat identification, network protection, intrusion detection, etc to defend itself against cyber attacks.

Susan **Davis 19,** general reporter of NATO, "NATO IN THE CYBER AGE:
STRENGTHENING SECURITY & DEFENCE, STABILISING DETERRENCE", STC,
https://www.nato-pa.int/download-file?filename=sites/default/files/2019-09/148%20STC%20Davis%20-%20NATO%20IN%20THE%20CYBER%20AGE%20-%20fall%20revision%20-%20clean%2011.9.19.pdf

[As armed forces]{.underline} around the world, including in potential
adversary states, [build up]{.underline} their cyber capabilities, NATO
and its member states must devise strategies and policies [to counter
the threat]{.underline} of serious state-directed cyber attacks.
Overall, [NATO is leaning heavily on the same general strategies it uses
to counter other attacks: dissuasion by denial and deterrence by
punishment.]{.underline} However, Allies should continue to support work
on international norms and engage in serious discussions if and how
strategies such as persistent engagement, as outlined above, can
supplement overall NATO strategy. [1. Norms in Cyber Space
25.]{.underline} Due to the specific characteristics of malicious cyber
code, arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation measures very
likely remain beyond reach for now, most importantly because
verification seems impossible. However, the [further development of
norms in cyber space could become an important pillar of support against
such attacks]{.underline}. NATO continues to argue that international
law applies to cyber space, including international humanitarian law and
the United Nations Charter. This is also in line with the declaration of
the 2013 Report of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on
Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the
Context of International Security (UN GGE, 2013). The Alliance has
declared its support for "work on voluntary international norms of
responsible state behaviour and confidence-building measures regarding
cyberspace" (NATO, 2016b). [Allies]{.underline} furthermore [made
clear]{.underline} [that they "stand to benefit from a norms-based,
predictable, and secure cyberspace"]{.underline} (NATO, 2018a).
[However, it is unrealistic to expect that NATO]{.underline}, as an
Alliance of 29 sovereign nations, [could become the primary driving
force for the further development of norms.]{.underline} Instead,
individual Allies must continue to drive this effort in the
international community and encourage other member states to do the
same. [2. Cyber Security and Defence 26.]{.underline} Strategies of
dissuasion by denial aim at "dissuading an action by having the
adversary see a credible capability to prevent him from achieving
potential gains adequate to motivate the action" (Davis, 2014). In other
words, [the defender must make such an attack look futile: the attacker
should either fail or,]{.underline} at the very least[, not benefit from
a cyber attack (]{.underline}Nye, 2017). [Such cyber dissuasion is
squarely premised on strong cyber security]{.underline} and defence,
which is primarily a national responsibility, but **[NATO must and does
play a role,]{.underline}** which the next sub-sections show (see also
Box 4). 27. In theory, [cyber security and defence is a straightforward
proposition.]{.underline} Defenders try to reduce vulnerabilities, block
access points, and minimise the impact of payloads. Cyber security and
defence include a range of preventive, passive, and active measures.
[Those seeking to protect]{.underline} their [networks must
strengthen]{.underline} their capabilities in several areas: [threat
identification; network protection; intrusion detection; responses
against attacks; and resilience and recovery]{.underline} (US NIST,
n.d.; see Box 5). [Determined intruders]{.underline} are often very
agile and [adapt rapidly to circumvent new cyber security]{.underline}
or defence [measures]{.underline}. [Allies]{.underline}, thus, [often
turn to more active cyber defence]{.underline}. For example, the US DOD,
under its active cyber defence concept, can synchronise defence across
all government and critical infrastructure networks. In other words,
they defend more than just the networks owned and operated by the DOD. A
step beyond is the so-called 'defend forward' concept, adopted by the
United States in 2018 for example. When defending forward, [defenders
can cross over into the attacker's networks to conduct intelligence
operations]{.underline}; [try to disrupt]{.underline} ongoing or even
planned [attacks]{.underline}; [quickly reverse damage]{.underline} from
attacks; [and]{.underline}, in extreme situations, [punish
attackers]{.underline} (Hoffman and Levite, 2017; US DOD, 2018).

### S -- Training

#### NATO should enhance cyber protection by developing uniform cybersecurity regulations -- aggressive cyberattacks increasing

**Lete & Dege '17** \[Bruno & Daiga; 2017; senior fellow or security and
defense policy in GMF's security office; trainee in office, "NATO
cybersecurity: a roadmap to resilience,
<https://www.gmfus.org/sites/default/files/NATO%2520Cybersecurity_edited.pdf>\]

The core of NATO cybersecurity efforts lie at the member-state level.
[NATO is responsible for protecting its own institutional information
and communication systems, but it has little say in coordinating how
member states develop their national cyber defense
capabilities]{.underline}. Despite having signed the Cyber Defense
Pledge at the Warsaw NATO Summit, many member states still struggle to
implement and evaluate their national cyber-security plans. [As a result
NATO's efforts at developing uniform, alliance-wide cybersecurity are
undermined]{.underline} by significant inconsistencies across the
national level of the member states and NATO's collective security and
deterrence in cyberspace still show serious vulnerabilities against the
backdrop of a growing number of attacks. For NATO to operationalize
cyberspace as a domain of NATO defense policy and planning --- as was
agreed at the NATO Warsaw Summit --- the Alliance should have
authorizations from member states to do more than just provide advice,
expertise, training, or education. Similar to how NATO coordinates
[Allied military forces in the conventional domain, NATO could also be
asked to evaluate how member states can develop, synergize, and
complement their mutual national cyber defenses. At a minimum, NATO
should develop standards and better indicators that allow a standardized
measurement of a nation's annual progress --- and should be tasked with
testing and measuring members' capabilities annually.]{.underline} To
achieve this objective, a [strong cooperation with the European Union is
essential]{.underline}. NATO and the EU could work together to design
minimum cybersecurity requirements and benchmarks that would also be
adopted by the European Defense Agency. Rapid Assessment and
Decision-Making Tools The scale, speed, and intensity of today's
cyber-attacks demand a new approach to respond at the political,
military, and civilian level. To develop a rapid decision-making process
when facing a cyber-attack NATO can take a few effective measures across
its organization. First, more resources must be allocated to accurately
and quickly detect and define hostile cyber actions. Further work on
indications, warnings, and situational awareness is critical. In this
context, NATO's various civil and military intelligence units, inter
alia, could have a useful role. In addition, the Supreme Allied
Commander Europe (SACEUR) could be granted more powers by the North
Atlantic Council in authorizing some of the preparatory procedures. [At
the same time, NATO headquarters should increase the number of exercises
that test rapid decisions-making procedures in complex and demanding
cyber crisis-conflict scenarios. Much can also be done at the
member-state level.]{.underline} Allies and willing partners should
continue to work on improving and updating threat assessments, and
facilitating closer intelligence cooperation. In this light, Allies
should identify information sharing as a clear requirement and task.
NATO could also intensify its interaction with national intelligence
services and establish supply chain management partnerships with
national industries. Cyber threats come in the form of networks and it
takes a similarly well-organized network of international and
cross-sector cooperation to defeat those threats. [Common Rules of
Engagement NATO has not commonly defined the circumstances, conditions,
degree, and manner in which the use of force may apply if one of its
member states suffers a cyber-attack. Triggering the authorization to
use force in the context of Article 5 may be more obvious if a member
state faces a large-scale, devastating cyber-attack where the source of
the attack can be clearly attributed.]{.underline} But the need is much
more urgent to define when and how NATO must respond against the
day-to-day cyber intrusions that fall below the threshold of being
perceived as a clear act of aggression. [NATO policy still allows for
too many gray zones]{.underline} that are being exploited by adversaries
who are clever enough not to cross a line that would trigger a common
response from the Alliance. Cybersecurity incidents like the alleged
Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee's emails show that the
United States and the NATO Allies are still unclear about the conditions
and manner to respond in cyberspace. The Tallinn Manual published by the
NATO CCDCoE offers a set of guidelines on how states can define rules of
engagement, countermeasures, retaliation operations, and other forms of
response within the context of the international law if they are to face
an act of cyber aggression. But NATO is still far removed from having
adopted a common view and interpretation on the subject. The North
Atlantic Council would still need to assess each individual cyber-attack
case by case without the support of standard measurement tools and
indicators that can help NATO formulate a proportionate political or
military response. [As more cyber policies and laws are taking shape,
NATO could demonstrate political, military, and intellectual leadership
by clearly defining rules of engagement in cyberspace.]{.underline}
[Consider Offensive Cybersecurity NATO now recognizes a serious
cyber-attack as a potential Article 5 trigger. But the doctrine and
crisis management conditions enshrined in NATO's cyber policy puts the
emphasis on a defensive posture only.]{.underline} As such, the Alliance
fails to recognize cyber as a force multiplier that could be of
importance to the defense of NATO nations. Russia for instance considers
offensive cyber capabilities to be an integral part of its military
power and especially as a way to make up for its relative lack of
conventional forces compared to NATO. The rise in connectivity,
smartphone proliferation, cloud computing, growth of application
development, and other technological advances open new avenues to
attackers and force defenders to cover an ever-increasing number of
fields. In the long run, NATO's defensive approach is not sustainable[.
It is time for NATO to start a debate on offensive cybersecurity and map
the feasibility of coordinating counter strikes, and to establish a
significant offensive cyber capability.]{.underline} NATO could center
this debate on projecting offensive cyber warfare capabilities as a
means of deterrence, similar to the perceived value of nuclear weapons
to deter attacks against NATO. Offensive security will allow the
Alliance to better control the virtual battlefield. There are valuable
cyber capabilities worth attaining, including the ability to conduct
reconnaissance and surveillance, intercept communications, or deny
resources and access. NATO may find increasing support to have a
conversation on offensive cyber security with its allies. As member
states are increasingly preoccupied with defense and deterrence issues
in cyber-space they will show more receptivity to cooperation with NATO
on developing centralized offensive cyber capabilities. NATO and Cyber
Industry Cooperation Cybersecurity is largely market-driven. Government
intelligence capabilities increasingly find it hard to keep up with the
requirements for combating the surge in cyber threats. [NATO should play
a crucial role in facilitating contacts between those member states that
seek stronger links with the private sector and encourage the role that
industry can play in cyber threat deterrence and intelligence
sharing.]{.underline} Flagship initiatives, such as the NATO Industry
Cyber Partnership, are important steps in that direction but there is
still a need to build more access and trust between NATO governments and
industry. Educating member states and partner nations about the role of
the private sector in cybersecurity is key. To make the partnership with
the industry more effective NATO could play a more important role in
mapping and evaluating what kind of cyber defense technologies and
intelligence gathering methods the private sector offers, share lessons
learned with the member states and encourage capitals to integrate the
best practices into capabilities, policy, and implementation planning.
NATO can also play an essential role in improving communications and
information sharing between the private and the public sectors. More can
be done at the NATO level to identify what kind of information between
governments and companies can or cannot be shared, to develop
standardized methods and formats for information sharing, and to
encourage the use of automated platform capabilities to share this
information quickly. Build a Robust Public Diplomacy Campaign [The first
frontier of cyber defense is the individual. Citizens who are digitally
empowered, cyber aware, and cyber educated will display a more
responsible behavior and automatically increase NATO's collective
security in cyberspace. NATO needs a narrative on why cybersecurity
matters beyond public belief that a major cyber-attack is
improbable]{.underline}. What can NATO do in cyberspace that national
security agencies cannot do? Which level of cybersecurity is needed
rather than which one we can afford? NATO societies should be exposed to
debate through parliaments, media, nongovernmental organizations, and
academia. Externally, the Alliance must adapt to the reality that
countries hostile to NATO will continue to use their own cyber
capabilities and massive state propaganda organizations to attack NATO
systems and discredit everything the Alliance does. NATO has to be able
to engage in and win this information war at the elite decision-maker
and opinion-former levels rather than simply raise awareness of its
existence and activities among a global public.

If the Ukraine crisis ends in anything other than a major conflict, the
U.S. and its [NATO allies must now take a]{.underline} far [**more
serious** look at how they are shaping the future defense of
Europe]{.underline}, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean if NATO is to
hold together; create an effective structure of deterrence and defense;
and ensure that the West, other democracies, and other major powers can
compete with both Russia and China. In doing so, [the U.S.
and]{.underline} all of [its]{.underline} strategic [partners in NATO
must focus on correcting the major shortfalls in the military and
deterrent capabilities of each member state]{.underline}, instead of
fixating on NATO-wide concepts or common funding efforts. This is not
simply a matter of setting broad priorities and issuing new strategies.
Military reality is not an exercise in writing more vague generic
statements of good intentions. [The Russian threat to Ukraine has made
it]{.underline} all too [clear that the U.S. and its allies must create
and]{.underline} actually [implement meaningful force plans]{.underline}
instead of issuing more strategic rhetoric. [NATO must work together to
assess the role each country should play in creating a more effective
alliance rather than referring to NATO-wide generalities]{.underline}.
Member countries must develop credible Cordesman: NATO and the Lessons
of the Ukraine Crisis February 16, 2022 4 force plans, programs, and
priorities that reflect the radically different capabilities of given
NATO countries, and they must find solutions to their radically
different funding needs and capabilities by developing a suitable mix of
very different national defense budgets. In doing so, the U.S. must
fully recognize its own blunders in focusing on burden-sharing. The U.S.
needs to fully consult with its NATO and other strategic partners. [The
U.S. needs to make it clear that there is no case for some "European"
solution to Western security,]{.underline} and it must avoid any future
cases like the casual way in which the U.S. engaged Australia and the UK
in a closer alliance by suddenly substituting U.S. nuclear submarines
for French conventional submarines. As is the case in the Middle East
and the rest of the world, [the U.S. cannot afford to constantly raise
new series of doubts about the ability to rely on the U.S. as a
strategic partner. The U.S. also needs to revitalize its focus on NATO
and Europe.]{.underline} [China's emergence as a major strategic
challenge is all too real, but Europe and Russia are just as critical to
an effective U.S. strategic posture]{.underline} as are China and Asia[.
The recent U.S. focus on the Chinese threat is all too necessary, but so
is the U.S. focus on NATO, Russia]{.underline}, and the rest of the
world. The U.S. must treat all its strategic patterns as real partners,
and the U.S. needs to recognize that its strategic force plans must
continue to be global -- not swing from region to region. At the same
time, Europe needs to be far more realistic about its strategic
dependence on U.S. forces and the major shortfall in most European
forces. [European members of NATO need to do far more to improve the
modernization, interoperability, sustainability, and deployment
capabilities of many of its member states]{.underline}. [They need to
recognize there is no credible European alternative to NATO and an
Atlantic alliance,]{.underline} and they should focus on
nation-by-nation force improvements, rather than burden-sharing and
arbitrary spending levels. As the following summary analysis of current
national forces shows[, NATO]{.underline} not only must deal with many
individual sets of national military weaknesses, it [must address a wide
range of **"emerging and disruptive**" technologies that are steadily
reshaping military forces,]{.underline} tactics, and capabilities.1 Once
again, it must be stressed that this cannot be done by announcing new
NATO strategies in broad terms or setting common goals for the entire
alliance. It also cannot be done by repeatedly issuing equally vacuous
national defense white papers that do not commit countries to specific
actions, plan, programs, and budgets or that do not honestly address the
problems in current national forces. Both the U.S. and European nations
need to properly assess national defense spending levels in terms of
actual country's individual military requirements and spending
capability. NATO-wide quotes are pointless. At the same time. Such
efforts need to be driven by net assessments of the relative size of
Russian and Belarusian military forces, modernization, and spending, and
they need end the present emphasis on burden-sharing by arbitrary
percentage of GDP and equipment spending. The following data on Russian,
U.S., and NATO European military spending alone make it clear that [the
U.S.,]{.underline} all other member countries, [and NATO]{.underline} as
an organization [need to use such net assessments of their]{.underline}
present and future [capability to **deter and defend against
Russia**,]{.underline} determine what actions member countries should
actually do to improve their forces[, and set]{.underline} individual
[national goals for given forces on modernization]{.underline} at a time
when there is an ongoing revolution in military affairs that will last
for at least the next few decades. They also need to plan collectively
Cordesman: NATO and the Lessons of the Ukraine Crisis February 16, 2022
5 to deal with the ongoing emergence of China as a far larger and more
effective military superpower than Russia -- and in doing so to create a
stable balance of deterrence in dealing with both Russia and China.

#### Nato key to Global stability---Nato radiates security

David **Wemer**; July 5, **2018**; "Here's why the United States needs
NATO";New
Atlantist;https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/here-s-why-the-united-states-needs-nato/

[NATO promotes peace within Europe and deters major US adversaries from
launching large-scale conventional wars]{.underline}. World War II cost
the United States more than 400,000 lives and an estimated \$4.1
trillion (in 2011 dollars). NATO has been key to preserving peace within
the European continent and preventing other adversaries from launching a
major conventional war. According to credible sources, a major
conventional war today could cost the United States upwards of \$2.5
trillion per year. [NATO]{.underline} also [promotes the American values
of democracy and rule of law. Twenty-six of the twenty-nine NATO member
states were labelled as "free]{.underline}" by Freedom House in 2018.
[By comparison, just 39 percent of the world's population
lives]{.underline} in ["free]{.underline}" countries. [NATO is a force
multiplier that gives the United States access to military tools in
greater numbers than it can achieve by]{.underline}
[itself]{.underline}. Non-US NATO members have 1,857,000 active duty
service members and 1,232,290 reservists. The seven largest non-US NATO
member armies have the same number of active duty troops as the United
States (1.3 million). Non-US NATO members can deploy 6,983 battle tanks,
34,000 armored vehicles, 2,600 combat aircraft, 382 attack helicopters,
252 major naval craft (including submarines), and 1,582 patrol and
surface combatants. France and the United Kingdom alone provide 30
percent of the Alliance's ballistic-missile-submarine fleet. [NATO's
Eu]{.underline}ropean members [are beginning to host]{.underline} the
first stages of the Alliance's [new ballistic-missile-defense system
aimed at preventing]{.underline} long-range [attacks by rogue states on
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Eu]{.underline}rope.
[NATO members frequently share intelligence across the Alliance, aiding
US operations and intelligence-gathering]{.underline}. The United
Kingdom, France, and Germany alone add 40,000 intelligence personnel to
the Alliance's intelligence capabilities. Non-US NATO members host
twenty-eight US main operating bases in Europe, which cut down on the
time needed for the United States to respond to a crisis and are
critical for US missions in the Middle East and North Africa. In 2009,
for example, Germany contributed \$800 million to offset and improve its
US bases. [NATO undertakes numerous missions to protect member states
and promote security around the globe.]{.underline} NATO has five active
missions around the world deploying 18,000 troops. Since the end of the
Cold War, NATO has completed thirteen missions including two in the
United States (Hurricane Katrina relief and post-9/11 air reconnaissance
patrol). NATO allies contributed thousands of troops to the
International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, including 38,000
in 2011, saving the United States an estimated \$49 billion that year.
The operation in Afghanistan was the first and only time NATO's mutual
defense commitment was invoked. Non-US members sustained more than 1,000
combat deaths in Afghanistan, with an additional one hundred lost by
NATO partners. Non-US NATO members contributed more than 60 percent of
assets for Operation Unified Protector in Libya. Non-US Coalition
members flew one-third of all coalition airstrikes against the Islamic
State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) in Operation Inherent Resolve. NATO's
Operation Ocean Shield against piracy in the Gulf of Aden has been led
at different times by Denmark, Spain, Norway, Italy, the Netherlands,
the United Kingdom, and Portugal. NATO supports and protects the
economies of Europe, which are critical to the health of the US economy.
[US trade with the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [reached
\$699 billion in 2015, only made possible because of the
security]{.underline} and stability provided [by NATO.]{.underline} US
exports to the former Communist NATO member states (not including East
Germany) grew from \$0.9 billion in 1989 to \$9.4 billion in 2016.
Non-US NATO members rely heavily on the US defense industry to supply
their forces. Currently, European members are planning to purchase as
many as 500 new F-35s from the United States.

#### NATO is key to preventing war-- it keeps Russia at bay 

**Hooker 4/21/22**

*Dr. Richard D. Hooker, Jr. is a nonresident senior fellow with the
Atlantic Council* \[ March 2022 "How the West can manage escalation in
Ukraine and
beyond." https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/managing-escalation-in-ukraine/.
Accessed 26 Apr. 2022.

[Moscow's invasion of Ukraine is transforming Europe's security
architecture, as well as NATO's strategic priorities and its defense and
deterrence posture]{.underline}. [Russia's ruthless aggression and
NATO's response increase the possibility of purposeful or inadvertent
escalation in Europe]{.underline}. Whether this takes the form of
heightened conflict in Ukraine, increased tension across the whole or
parts of NATO's eastern flank---from Ukraine and the Black Sea to the
Baltic Region and the High North---or in non-kinetic, subthreshold
domains, understanding how these dynamics might degrade transatlantic
stability is critical. This study will seek to identify key rungs on the
escalation ladder around the war in Ukraine; assess how [the current
crisis might escalate inside Ukraine and across NATO's eastern flank;
explore how the US and NATO posture can prevent or limit escalation; and
offer recommendations for how the United States and NATO can adapt their
strategy, posture, and activities to manage escalatory
dynamics]{.underline}. In response to the invasion of Ukraine, the West
has imposed stinging sanctions, disrupting the Russian economy and
forcing the Kremlin to burn through its financial reserves. Major
Russian banks have been disconnected from SWIFT, the international
system that facilitates financial transactions, while some oligarchs
have been sanctioned. Many allies and partners have provided massive
financial and material aid---in the form of funding, as well as
anti-tank and air-defense systems and other military equipment---to
bolster Ukrainian resistance. This assistance has helped to stiffen an
already stout Ukrainian defense, which has inflicted heavy losses on the
Russian military. Vladimir Putin now faces the real possibility of a
stalled offensive, or even outright defeat. In this circumstance, Russia
still has cards to play. Failure in Ukraine places Putin's political
survival at risk and he is, therefore, unlikely to withdraw. His present
difficulties are more likely to provoke escalation within or around
Ukraine, both in the military realm and in other domains. As he climbs
the escalation ladder, Putin's risk tolerance will increase, as his key
subordinates will surely realize. The ultimate risks, however, are
removal from office, imprisonment, or even execution. Accordingly, Putin
is far more likely to press harder in Ukraine than to acquiesce to a
negotiated settlement that leaves him without tangible gains.¶ The
following discussion of Russian escalatory options is linked to the
progress of the campaign in Ukraine and presents alternate scenarios
based on Russian progress or failure and the degree to which the West
provides critical support and/or direct intervention. Escalatory steps
are described in ascending order of severity and risk. Response options
to control or mitigate Russian escalation follow. It is important to
note that [Russian, Ukrainian, and Western perspectives or "lenses" on
what is escalatory may differ significantly in both time and
space]{.underline}. This factor must be borne in mind when assessing
adversary actions. ¶ [As Putin and his senior advisers consider options,
conditions on the ground will drive their calculus]{.underline}. Should
the Russian military manage to recover its footing and resume progress,
however halting, more extreme options may be held in reserve. [If the
campaign evolves into a "frozen" conflict]{.underline}, like the Donbas
but on a larger scale, [Putin's focus will shift to
destabilizing]{.underline} [the]{.underline} Volodymyr [Zelenskyy regime
in Kyiv]{.underline} and sanctions relief. [Should Ukraine achieve
decisive success in recovering its national territory, Putin's survival
may be at risk]{.underline}, and incentives to employ harsher and more
high-risk measures will grow[. Escalation to each of the below "rungs"
will depend on Putin's perception and assessment of how the campaign is
progressing and the prospects for ultimate success]{.underline} or
failure. Though speculative, likely triggers for escalation into each
subsequent phase of the conflict might include: An assessment that the
campaign has stalled temporarily and different approaches are needed to
regain momentum; An assessment that the campaign has stalled outright
and recovery is unlikely without more extreme measures; and An
assessment that defeat is imminent, and that Putin may fall from power,
placing all his options on the table. As the conflict drags on, NATO and
European Union (EU) actions can be decisive one way or the other, as
described further below.

future of cybersecurity cooperation among the United States and its
Indo- Pacific allies, it is easy to identify numerous challenges,
usually arising from frictions over threat assessments, desired
end-states, doctrine, language, and the different public-private sector
relationships in each country. But these challenges also represent
opportunities, places where concrete progress can be made and where
frictions lend themselves to concerted action. [Progress in working one
will reinforce progress in working the others. Unity of command may be a
bridge too far, near-unity of action is attainable. An achievable goal
is to a place where the US and its allies can convey to an adversary

#### Developing an integrated OCO doctrine among NATO allies solves cyberconflict

Security, https://www.ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/TP_08_2015_0.pdf\]

[The central question for NATO's cyber doctrine is how the [lack
of]{.mark} an **[articulated]{.mark} offensive [cyber
capability]{.mark}** [affects]{.mark} its **[ability to deter]{.mark}**
or defend.]{.underline} Put another way, [can any military force
credibly claim to have advanced capabilities if it does not include
offensive cyber operations in its arsenal? Offensive capabilities,
unlike NATO's current defensive posture, involve deliberate intrusions
into opponent networks or systems with the intention of causing
disruption, damage or destruction.]{.underline} The question of NATO and
offensive cyber capabilities touches on a range of sensitive political
issues that militate against any change in policy in the near term.

[[The US has]{.mark} always [been **overly secretive**]{.mark} about its
offensive cyber capabilities, even after a flood of media leaks have
made the most sensitive doctrine publicly available. [This]{.mark}
**secrecy** [has carried over into **NATO**, and is **unhelpful** in
that it **increases**]{.mark} the [likelihood of]{.mark} opponents
**[miscalc]{.mark}**ulating as they consider the risks of using force or
coercion against NATO members or interests. A [lack of]{.mark} public
**[discourse]{.mark}** [on **o**]{.mark}ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
**[o]{.mark}**peration**[s]{.mark}** **[undercuts]{.mark}** the
[**legitimacy** of **NATO op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}** by failing
to build public understanding, and leaves NATO open to charges of
sinister plots, since denial of offensive capabilities is not credible
when two NATO members are world leaders in cyber
operations.]{.underline}

Parallels between cyber operations and nuclear strategy are usually
misleading, but cannot always be dismissed. The parallel for NATO is
that [cyber attack is a "weapon"]{.underline} with both strategic and
tactical uses, [which only a few NATO members possess]{.underline}.
Unlike nuclear weapons, however, [the [procedures for integrating
**o**]{.mark}ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
**[o]{.mark}**peration**[s]{.mark}** [into **NATO's defensive actions**
are **not**]{.mark} at all **[obvious]{.mark}**, if they exist. [NATO
will **need to describe** how]{.mark} the **[cyber
capabilities]{.mark}** possessed by]{.underline} a few of [its members
[will **support NATO's defensive activities**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
[NATO's credibility in defence **requires some public discussion** on
the use of **o**ffensive **c**yber **o**peration**s**.]{.underline}

There has been a confusing debate over the merits of cyber deterrence,
but one conclusion that we can draw from this discussion is that both
[the contribution of **[cyber op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** to
deterrence and the ability to deter cyber attack [work **best** when
**embedded** in]{.mark} [a larger military]{.mark} force
[structure]{.mark}. Adding offensive cyber capabilities to NATO's force
structure and response doctrine will increase its deterrent
capabilities]{.underline} -- by how much is unclear, but what is clear
is that [a failure to add cyber capabilities will erode a credible
deterrent as cyber operations are increasingly embedded into military
operations]{.underline}.5

Beyond deterrence, two other factors point to the need for additional
consideration of NATO's public posture on offensive cyber operations.
The first is that [**[cyber]{.mark}** technique**[s]{.mark}** are
[**essential** for]{.mark} the kinds of [combat]{.mark} operations that
NATO forces may carry out [in the future]{.mark}. No modern **air
force** would enter into combat without electronic warfare (EW)
capabilities]{.underline}; as cyber and EW merge into a single activity,
[air operations will require cyber support. The same is true for
**special** forces **op**eration**s**. **[Of]{.mark}**fensive
**[c]{.mark}**yber capabilities [will shape the battlefields of the
future.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Second, [NATO's potential opponents will use cyber techniques in new
ways, in what some have called "hybrid warfare".]{.underline}6 [These
include]{.underline} countries traditionally of concern to NATO, but
[[cyber threats could]{.mark} also [come from new actors]{.mark}, such
as **Iran** or **North Korea**, [and proxy or non-state actors
such]{.mark} as the **Syrian Electronic Army**.]{.underline} These
nations and groups, using cyber techniques, now have new ways to strike
NATO countries.

[Military doctrine is changing as opponents seek to circumvent US
military power and use a blend of political action and "influence
operations", special forces, proxies and irregular units, unconventional
tactics and cyber techniques to apply force to gain their
ends.]{.underline} Cyber techniques for political action and "influence
operations" are not intended to destroy or disrupt, but [rather to put
coercive political pressure on targets. This [new]{.mark} style of
[warfare]{.mark} [will **challenge planning for mutual
defence**]{.mark}.]{.underline} For these reasons, the need for more
than defensive or technical cyber capabilities will increase.7

#### [NATO OCOs]{.underline} key to win cyberwar\-\--prevents nuclear meltdowns and financial collapse

[Cyber as a hybrid threat to, and enabler of, military
operations]{.underline}

[**[All]{.mark} future [military confrontations]{.mark}** [are]{.mark}
expected [to be fought with **cyber weapons**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
These [**[offensive]{.mark} cyber [capabilities]{.mark}** [in the hands
of adversaries pose a]{.mark} **significant [threat]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} the **[military forces]{.mark}** [and **critical
infrastructure** of NATO]{.mark} member states]{.underline}; and [the
Alliance **recognizes** that **cyber-attacks** (as hybrid threats) can
be **as damaging as conventional** ones]{.underline}. This is [because
malicious cyber activities against [computers that control physical
processes]{.mark} can be as dangerous as threats that are purely
physical]{.underline} in nature and [[could lead to]{.mark}
**explosions,** **[nuclear meltdowns]{.mark}**, **blackouts**, [or
**financial crises**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As put by NATO Secretary
General, ["[in]{.mark} just [**minutes**, a **single**]{.mark}
cyber**[attack]{.mark}** can inflict billions of dollars' worth of
damage to our economies, bring global companies to a
standstill]{.underline}, ~~paralyze~~ our critical infrastructure,
undermine our democracies and ~~cripple~~ our military capabilities".4

Over the past decade, [Allies have identified a steep increase in cyber
activities targeting the critical infrastructure sectors that NATO
military operations rely upon.]{.underline} Directly or indirectly,
[these malicious cyber activities [can]{.mark} also [disrupt]{.mark} the
Alliance's **[logistics]{.mark}** and **[forward
op]{.mark}**eration[**s**.]{.mark} **NATO's commitment** to]{.underline}
"operate and [**defend itself** "]{.underline}5 [in the **cyber**
domain]{.underline} as effectively as in the geographic domains
[came]{.underline}, thus, [as a **direct recognition** of cyber as a
hybrid threat to both the Allies and the Alliance.]{.underline}

Compared to the air, land and sea domains, the cyber domain is not
constrained by national borders (although certain physical aspects of it
might be located within them). This distinction between the cyber and
the geographic domains is important to note, because NATO was founded in
response to external military threats without the right to intervene in
internal security matters, where member states maintain the monopoly
over the use of force. In the cyber domain, the distinction between
internal and external security threats is harder to ascertain. When
integrating offensive cyber capabilities into its defence and deterrence
mandate, NATO would inevitably tackle certain aspects inherent to
internal security; and yet, not legally infringe on the sovereignty of
the Allies as long as effects amounting to force or intervention are not
employed against the physical systems residing in these nations.6
[[Operating]{.mark} in the cyber domain [requires]{.mark}]{.underline},
thus, [that [member states **better integrate**]{.mark} their
**[offensive cyber]{.mark}** [capabilities]{.mark} into NATO operations
not just to win future wars, but also [to **avoid**]{.mark} elements of
[**friction** between Allies]{.mark}, which may arise [from
**unilateral**]{.mark} cyber **[effects]{.mark}** to defend critical
infrastructure.]{.underline}

NATO's adversaries in the cyber domain

[Warfare in the cyber domain is already conducted against NATO member
states by both state and nonstate actors. It is also conducted by NATO
member states against these external threats. [Within the
Alliance]{.mark}, however, [offensive cyber]{.mark} effects are [**not
yet part** of]{.mark} the **[mission planning]{.mark}** process and
**[integration]{.mark}** of national offensive cyber capabilities [into
**joint**]{.mark} NATO **[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** is
voluntary. [Integrating]{.mark} these national offensive cyber
capabilities into NATO operations, thus **[requires]{.mark}**, not only
a clear understanding of these capabilities, but also [**agreement** on
the]{.mark} cyber **[threat environment]{.mark}**]{.underline},
characterized by the intent and capabilities of NATO's current and/or
potential future adversaries.

[State adversaries]{.underline} in the cyber domain [include
[**Russia**, **China**]{.mark} and/or **[Iran]{.mark}**. These
[are]{.mark} countries known to be [building offensive cyber]{.mark}
capabilities specifically for the **purpose** of **using them [against
NATO]{.mark}** member states]{.underline}.7 In [Russia's]{.underline}
case, [cyber attacks were conducted]{.underline} against the critical
infrastructure of NATO member states and partner nations, as for example
[against US energy infrastructure in 2017 (including against a nuclear
powerplant]{.underline} near Burlington, Kansas)8 or against the Ukraine
power grid in December 2015. [[China has]{.mark} also [been
conducting]{.mark} **[persistent]{.mark}** cyber **[espionage]{.mark}**
using offensive cyber capabilities against core military and critical
infrastructure of NATO member states for years.]{.underline} For this
reason, the US Secretary of Defense, Mark T. Esper, remarked at the 2020
Munich Security Conference that [the **[5G Huawei
infrastructure]{.mark}** [is a **serious threat**]{.mark} to
NATO]{.underline}.9 Lastly, [**Iran's** offensive cyber capabilities
have also been observed during multiple attacks against the critical
infrastructure of NATO partner nations in the Middle East]{.underline}.

[NATO adversaries in the cyber domain also include non-state
actors]{.underline}, such as terrorist organizations. [The
US]{.underline} and the UK have [conducted]{.underline} several
successful **[o]{.underline}**ffensive **[c]{.underline}**yber
**[o]{.underline}**peration[s]{.underline} against those entities.
[These]{.underline} offensive cyber operations [had a significant force
multiplier effect]{.underline}, in conjunction with conventional actions
on the ground, at sea, in the air and from space, that contributed to
the defeat of Daesh in both Iraq and Syria.10 Today, most [Allies are
building offensive cyber capabilities needed to **deny adversaries the
freedom of maneuver**]{.underline} in the cyber domain.

The use of area denial weapon systems in the cyber domain

Anti-Access/Area Denial (**[A2/AD]{.underline}**) [weapon systems have
traditionally been used by NATO]{.underline} and its member states [to
prevent an adversary\'s freedom of maneuver on land, sea or
air]{.underline}. In the geographic domains, these capabilities include
land mines, missiles (cruise, ballistic, surface to air, anti-ship,
etc.), submarines, electronic warfare, and even Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE) weapons. In the cyber
domain A2/AD is achieved through offensive cyber operations.

Those operations have already been used for the purpose of achieving
A2/AD by NATO member states in the cyber domain. This is the case of
**[the US-led]{.underline}** Operation Glowing Symphony
(**[OGS]{.underline}**), [where \"the United States Cyber Command
reportedly]{.underline} acquired administrator [passwords]{.underline}
to \[Daesh\] websites. The passwords enabled deletion of digital
content, including videos used for recruitment, from cyber
infrastructure located in at least five countries outside actively
hostile areas of Iraq and Syria. Similar digital content reportedly
resided on cyber infrastructure in as many as 30 other States. Changing
the passwords reportedly locked IS administrators out of the web-
sites\". OGS restricted Daesh\'s freedom of maneuver on networks
physically residing in Iraq and Syria (which were controlled by the
terrorist group), but also worldwide, where a NATO member state (the US)
achieved denial of service effects against Daesh.

[OGS disrupted Daesh propaganda]{.underline} through content removal
from servers residing in multiple countries and through restricting
access to physical infrastructure needed to store digital data.
[Combined with operational successes against ISIL on the ground, OGS
actions resulted in]{.underline} [propaganda efforts being significantly
reduced]{.underline} on several global social media plat-forms,
including Twitter. One particular offensive cyber operation acted, ipso
facto, as an A2/AD platform where a NATO member state restricted access
to physical networks critical for Daesh recruitment, training,
radicalization, fundraising, and command and control.

**[[Integrating offensive cyber]{.mark} capabilities into NATO\'s
mandate for cyber deterrence and defence]{.underline}**

Operationalizing warfighting capabilities in the cyber domain, beyond
the traditional geographic domains, requires a new way of fighting in
the 21st century, challenging the deterrence and defence mandate of the
Alliance.

Speaking at the Cyber Defence Pledge Conference in London in May 2019,
NATO Secretary General highlighted that for deterrence to have full
effect against state and non-state adversaries, NATO and its member
states must be ready to use the full range of capabilities at their
disposal, to include national offensive cyber capabilities. Deterrence
is the act of diminishing an adversary\'s intent by highlighting the
excessive costs for the said adversary if it proceeds with an undesired
action. In NATO\'s case, deterrence is achieved by highlighting to an
adversary the excessive costs delivered through military means in the
event of an attack against Allies. For deterrence to be successful, the
adversary must believe that NATO is ready and willing to impose these
excessive costs across all operational domains, to include the cyber ■UK

domain. This may call for Allies to develop offensive cyber capabilities
and integrate them with NATO operations in order to collectively impose
a high enough cost to deter adversaries from aggressive behaviour. To
avoid escalation to total war and cyber fratricide during the fog of
war, Allies must also agree on a list of Flexible Deterrent Options
meant to allow for a gradual increase

of pressure in the cyber domain, and then hopefully limiting the scope
and intensity of conflict in this do-main. NATO Flexible Deterrent
[Options in the cyber domain could include]{.underline} (as presented in
Figure 1):

• [[Increasing NATO\'s readiness]{.mark} posture [through **cyber
education, training and exercises;**]{.mark}]{.underline}

• [Deploying NATO **Cyber Rapid Reaction teams** to conduct defensive
cyber operations and protecting critical infrastructure of NATO member
states and/or that NATO operations rely upon]{.underline};

• Increasing public awareness of malicious cyber activities and the
potential for conflict in the cy-ber domain;

• [[Taking steps to gain]{.mark} the [support]{.mark} of all NATO member
states [in response to the cyber threat]{.mark}]{.underline} and in
accordance with commitments of the 2016 Cyber Defence Pledge and the
2018 Brus-sels Summit;

• **[[Triggering Article 4]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the Treaty to
enhance **[[info]{.mark}rmation-[sharing]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and
mutual assistance]{.underline}]{.mark} in the cyber domain;

• Making official statements addressing violations of international law
in the cyber domain;

• Alerting and **[[deploying offensive cyber opera-tions
forces]{.underline}]{.mark}**;

• [Imposing cyber sanctions;]{.underline}

• **[[Conducting offensive cyber operations to achieve A2/AD
effects]{.mark} in the cyber domain]{.underline}**;

Offensive cyber operations have already been used for the purpose of
achieving A2/AD by NATO member states

• Triggering Article 5 of the Treaty; and

• [[Conducting offensive cyber operations]{.underline}]{.mark} in
com-bination with other maneuver forces across all operational domains.

12 Cyber sanctions are defined here as \"the actual or threatened
restriction of digital transactions to affect a behavioural change by a
NATO adversary through the introduction of psychological pressure
against its political leaders and populace\"; see A. Iftimie, \"Cyber
sanctions: weapo- nizing the embargo of flagged data in a fragmented
internet\", Journal of Information Warfare, Vol.19, No.1, 2020, p.52. 

[NATO Cyber Rapid Reaction teams are already equipped to conduct
defensive cyber operations]{.underline} in support of member states if
called upon. A mandate of cyber defence and security implies, however,
that NATO also starts to engage in active military measures to deny,
degrade, disrupt, deceive, or destroy an adversary\'s offensive cyber
capabilities. This requires the development of not only offensive cyber
A2/AD capabilities by Allies, but also the restructuring of the NATO
command structures, policies, processes

To avoid escalation to total war and cyber fratricide during the fog of
war, Allies must also agree on a list of Flexible Deterrent Options

(procurement, intelligence, operations, etc.) and engagements needed to
integrate them by the Alliance. [**[NATO coordination]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline}]{.mark} [both national and regional entities charged
with [cyber **security**]{.mark} **aspects will**]{.underline}, in
particular, **[[need to be enhanced]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Many
agreements already exist in the realm of defensive cyber at national and
regional levels (as seen with the 2016 NATO-EU Technical Arrangement on
Cyber Defence), but [politica]{.underline}l [consensus among Allies is
missing on whether they should be expanded to incorporate the collective
use of offensive cyber A2/AD capabilities.]{.underline}

Conclusion

**[[The lack of integrated offensive cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}** A2/AD
**[capabilities]{.underline}** [[undermines]{.mark} both [the **unity of
the Alliance**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and its mandate of defence]{.mark}
[and **deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the former, the lack of
coordination between Allies during unilateral cyber operations could
lead to friction when resulting effects infringe on Allied
cyber-physical infrastructures[. [It could also lead to **cyber
fratricide**]{.mark}, when **failure to properly attribute** Allied
digital personas occurs during these military operations]{.underline}.
On the latter, while most Allies are developing offensive cyber
capabilities, some remain unable to face the growing number of cyber
threats unilaterally.

[Successful defence and deterrence in the cyber domain calls, thus, [for
ready **collective offensive**]{.mark}]{.underline} cyber A2/AD
**[[capabilities that, when]{.mark} [integrated with NATO]{.mark}
operations]{.underline}**, [[would]{.mark} complement
national]{.underline} [and]{.underline}/ or [regional responses to
malicious cyber activities. If and when this integration
occurs,]{.underline} NATO Flexible Deterrence Options would also need to
be agreed upon in order to [[signal cyber
adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} that Allies will re-spond with one
voice if attacked in the cyber domain. Ultimately, political consensus
within the Alliance would still need to be built on the type of needed
collective offensive cyber capabilities (such as for A2/ AD purposes)
and on how to integrate them into NATO\'s existing operations and
missions.

#### NATO needs to be more offensive when dealing with cybersecurity -- waiting to respond will cause NATO to lose the fight in Cyberspace

Third, [NATO should coordinate a strategy of persistent engagement to
reduce Russian and Chinese activities]{.underline} to undercut the
Alliance in cyberspace. The concept of [persistent
engagement]{.underline} was developed by US Cyber Command, but the
rationale likewise [applies to NATO, deriving from the need to
combat]{.underline} the continuous campaigns of [cyberattacks coming
from Russia and China. Persistent engagement involves]{.underline}
[tracking adversaries]{.underline}, understanding their goals, analyzing
the tools used for attacks, [and taking actions to degrade their
capabilities]{.underline} to blunt ongoing, or prevent future, attacks.
The Alliance needs a persistent engagement cyber strategy as a key
element of its deterrence and defense. Customary international law,
including the law of countermeasures, pleas of necessity, and other
cyber norms, provides the international legal basis for a strategy of
persistent engagement. [Because NATO Allies have already been attacked
and are continuously being targeted by these adversaries, offensive
actions to counter such activities are justified,]{.underline} as long
as they are conducted proportionately. [While persistent engagement
arguably could increase instability in cyberspace, Alliance inaction is
far more dangerous.]{.underline} If Russia and China perceive no
consequences to their malign actions in cyberspace, they will only
continue and even intensify them. Inasmuch as NATO capabilities
generally reside in nations, [NATO nations are the appropriate vehicle
to implement persistent engagement.]{.underline} However, many Allies
lack the capacity to undertake persistent engagement on their own. As a
result, [NATO should leverage its collective nature to help Allies
coordinate a strategy of persistent engagement. NATO should focus its
persistent engagement efforts in three areas of high consequence to
member nations: 1) disruptions of key critical infrastructure (e.g.
electric grids, telecommunications networks, energy pipelines, and
finance systems); 2) cyber espionage to undermine NATO military
capabilities and advanced defense technologies; and 3) manipulation of
Allies' democratic processes, such as elections. NATO support to Allies
in these areas is fundamental to its core task of collective defense and
security.]{.underline} To accomplish persistent engagement effectively
in an Alliance context, [NATO should leverage its intelligence and
defense planning capacities to develop a system for Allies to constantly
track cyber threats from Russia and China]{.underline}. Through its
Intelligence and Security division, NATO should gather intelligence on
which Allied critical infrastructure, military capabilities, or
democratic processes are being targeted. Using this information, NATO's
Cyberspace Operations Center (CYOC) could outline ways to diminish
Russian and Chinese capabilities to execute such attacks. The CYOC
should share its analyses with pre-designated Allies who would work with
targeted countries and employ their own cyber effects against the
identified threats. [Nine NATO nations have already volunteered to
provide such effects in support of NATO activities.]{.underline} These
cyber-capable Allies would be responsible for persistently disrupting
adversaries' cyber activities based on NATO's guidance. This model would
make NATO's CYOC a planning hub for an Alliance-wide approach to
persistent engagement. It would allow NATO to empower its members to
take individual or multilateral actions against adversaries' hybrid
campaigns in cyberspace. [While NATO remains a defensive alliance,
waiting to respond to each cyber incident it suffers will cost NATO the
"fight" in cyberspace. Facing continuous hybrid campaigns from Russia
and China, NATO needs a more proactive cyber approach to support
Allies,]{.underline} even before the Article 5 collective defense
threshold is met. By building resilient cybersecurity architectures,
adopting active cyber defense, and coordinating a strategy of persistent
engagement, the Alliance can create its own continuous response campaign
to effectively respond to attacks in cyberspace.

#### Cyber intelligence solves and is better suited than deterrence\-\--the US can effectively reduce the fog of war and reduce the severity of OCOs

**Rovner 20**---Associate professor in the School of International
Service at American University, in 2018 and 2019 he served as
scholar-in-residence at the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber
Command \[Joshua Rovner, 3/26/2020, "The Intelligence Contest in
Cyberspace", Lawfare Blog,
<https://www.lawfareblog.com/intelligence-contest-cyberspace>\] AMarb

The [ongoing competition in cyberspace is largely an **intelligence
contest**.]{.underline} Although the technology is different, the
underlying contest exhibits all the characteristics of traditional
spy-versus-spy battles.

[An intelligence contest is an effort to **steal secrets and exploit
them** for relative advantage. Great powers]{.underline} today [are
using cyberspace with vigor, seeking to steal communications in transit
and data at rest. **China's effort to steal intellectual
property**]{.underline} via cyberspace [was]{.underline} famously
described as [the "most significant transfer of wealth in history."
China]{.underline} has [attempted to exploit this effort to **improve
its military capabilities**]{.underline}, with mixed results. [Russia
has]{.underline} also [become more active in **cyberspace
espionage**]{.underline}, targeting the United States and its partners
abroad.

Intelligence contests also include sabotage. All bureaucracies suffer
from some amount of friction: the inevitable daily hiccups that slow
down operations and make organizations less efficient. Sabotage in
cyberspace weaponizes friction to undermine rival capabilities and
morale. [Offensive cyberspace operations]{.underline} are well suited
for this task because they [offer a range of tools for the saboteur.
States can opt for cheap and easy harassment campaigns]{.underline} like
denial of service attacks, or they can engineer sophisticated operations
against specific facilities. In either case, the [benefits to the
saboteur are both practical and psychological. Practical results include
**harm to networks**, **data**, and **infrastructure**]{.underline}, all
of which forces the target to spend time and money on recovery.
Psychological results are equally important. It may not be necessary to
cause physical damage if personnel in target organizations fall victim
to frustration and finger pointing.

Finally, [intelligence contests involve efforts to pre-position
espionage assets that may be useful in war. Military
organizations]{.underline} increasingly [rely on cyberspace for
organizing and directing conventional campaigns. Intelligence agencies
have an obvious interest in monitoring their efforts. [**Gaining access
to adversary networks**]{.mark} makes it possible to **[reduce]{.mark}
the [fog of war]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the case of a [conflict.
It]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[suggests]{.mark} the [ability to
**confuse enemies** by **inhibiting** ]{.mark}**their
[communications]{.mark}** [or **flooding**]{.mark} **the zone with
[disinformation]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Cyber]{.mark}space [is]{.mark} a **[good]{.mark} venue [for
intelligence]{.mark}** [but]{.mark} a **[bad]{.mark} one [for
deterrence]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} It is good for intelligence because the
[ubiquity of cyber]{.mark}space in organizational management
[creates]{.mark} extraordinary [opportunities for]{.mark}
**surveillance**. States]{.underline} that depend on cyberspace for
normal operations also [make themselves vulnerable to [sabotage]{.mark}.
Even **[modest o]{.mark}**ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
**[o]{.mark}**peration[s can **inject friction**]{.mark} into adversary
organizations.]{.underline}

[**Deterrence is different**.]{.underline} It is difficult to deter
states from activities below the line of armed conflict because
[**[retaliatory threats]{.mark} inherently [lack credibility]{.mark}**.
No one is likely to believe that states will use violence to stop
espionage]{.underline}, for instance, which probably explains why small
states have spied on large ones for centuries. More importantly,
[**[victims are]{.mark} surprisingly [tolerant]{.mark} of cyber
operations**.]{.underline} Research suggests that [[**individuals are
less willing to retaliate**]{.mark} against cyber blows than physical
violence.]{.underline} If this is correct, then [**strategies based on
punishment are likely to fail**. **Deterrence by denial**
is]{.underline} also [likely to disappoint, because the
[barriers]{.mark} to entry [for espionage]{.mark} and harassment
[are]{.mark} relatively [low.]{.mark}]{.underline} States will continue
to conduct cyber intrusions even if previous efforts were unsuccessful.

There are important exceptions to this rule. [Deterring major attacks
against critical infrastructure is possible]{.underline}, for instance,
[because these attacks threaten significant harm to
civilians.]{.underline} Deterring this kind of cyberspace operation
makes sense because anyone considering such an attack would risk a
ferocious response. Executing large-scale attacks on infrastructure
probably also requires a lot of time, money and organization.
Adversaries would surely think twice about that investment, especially
if the United States issues clear deterrent threats. But deterrence is
mostly irrelevant in cyberspace, because most activities fall well short
of threats to infrastructure. Understanding the present problem in terms
of deterrence theory is not particularly helpful.

At best, [a well-fought [intelligence]{.mark} contest [can]{.mark}
**slowly [convince adversaries]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} certain
[**targets** and **methods** are **beyond the
pale**.]{.mark}]{.underline} During the Cold War, Soviet and U.S.
intelligence professionals came to observe some rules of the game.
[Aggressive counterintelligence methods were expected]{.underline}, for
example, but not against family members. [**Neither side could deter
intelligence efforts**, but they could structure the contest in order to
**reduce the risk**.]{.underline}

What does the future hold for the intelligence contest in cyberspace?
The good news is that [the United States is **exceptionally well
positioned to compete**. It possesses **extraordinary technical** and
**human resources**]{.underline}, in both the public and private
sectors. [Its intelligence **agencies are the largest** and **richest**
in the world. It]{.underline} also [benefits from **decades of
experience competing**]{.underline} against capable rivals. This is not
the first time the U.S. intelligence community has dealt with committed
and occasionally ruthless intelligence foes.

The bad news is that it will not be easy to know victory when we see it.
Intelligence contests are inherently hard to measure. They are allergic
to quantification, and the increasing volume of cyberspace activities
means that more attacks will occur even if there is a net gain in
cybersecurity. Observers will understandably be skeptical if U.S.
officials claim success in the midst of high-profile security incidents.
Moreover, progress reports will reflect differing value judgments. Those
who believe the government is obligated to protect private firms will
view all breaches as failures. Those who believe that the government has
no such obligation will likely view private-sector attacks as
unfortunate but unrelated to the government's effort against foreign
adversaries.

Although recognizing success will be hard, it is not impossible. Rough
indicators may offer useful clues. [If rules of the game are taking hold
in cyberspace, we should see changes in patterns of cyber
operations.]{.underline} Attackers will focus on some types of targets
and increasingly ignore others. The percentage of state attacks on
private firms and nongovernmental organizations should decrease.

[[Intelligence should]{.underline}]{.mark} also be able to
[[monitor]{.mark} the [**frequency** and **severity** of
**o**]{.mark}ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yberspace
**[o]{.mark}**peration[s.]{.mark}]{.underline} Success will obtain when
rivals come to see the risks of action and the value of restraint. While
they will not cease activities, [**[high-profile]{.mark} damaging
[attacks will become rare]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} States will]{.underline}
also [eschew the use of malware that they cannot control]{.underline};
instead, they will use customized payloads against specific targets and
take steps to ensure that they do not inadvertently affect other
systems. [[Fearful of letting]{.mark} their [intelligence]{.mark}
activities [**spill into other domains**, they will]{.mark} design
operations to [**avoid unwanted contagion**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[There will]{.underline} no doubt [be difficulties incorporating cyber
operations components into overall US strategy countering ISIL and other
non-state adversaries]{.underline}; however, [it is clear national
security leadership in **[Washington will leverage cyber]{.mark}
capabilities** more significantly.]{.underline} One [[issue that will
continue to dog **o**]{.mark}ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
**[o]{.mark}**peration[s and intel]{.mark}ligence [activities is]{.mark}
the **[equities]{.mark} question**---should the US government turn over
knowledge it accrues]{.underline} regarding cyber vulnerabilities to the
technology industry so that they may be repaired. For instance, [is it
more desirable for USCYBERCOM and the National Security Agency (NSA) to
keep information]{.underline} regarding broken encryption
implementations or software as was alleged in the Heartbleed bug in the
OpenSSL software libraries? Issues such as this will be a major policy
question to consider.

Ultimately, the [[cyber conflict against ISIL will serve as a **template
for future cyber action** against **terror**
]{.mark}**groups**]{.underline}, insurgents, and violent transnational
criminal syndicates. Looking backward, [[we]{.mark} can [see]{.mark} the
[**effective application** of **robust signals intel**]{.mark}**ligence

Colombian operations against]{.underline} the Fuerzas Armadas
Revolucionarias de Colombia [(FARC).]{.underline} There can be little
doubt that the Colombian military and police were made significantly
more effective with the addition of US intelligence capabilities.
[[Policymakers are keen to eradicate]{.mark} or at least damage [ISIL
but will need to ask **how cyber weapons can frustrate
it**]{.mark}]{.underline} as much as anything else can. [[The more cyber
tactics can **short-circuit ISIL's operational capabilities**, the
better.]{.mark} What is necessary for US cyber operators are clear
objectives from senior leadership on what they want to
produce.]{.underline} The engineers that build USCYBERCOM's tools and
the hackers that serve as its operational forces can easily enough push
back on what they believe is the art of the possible.

Though hard to accept, the [[detonation]{.mark} of a nuclear device --
[by **states** or **non-state** actors -- is]{.mark}]{.underline} today
a **[[plausible]{.underline}]{.mark}** scenario. And while much of the
world's focus has been on the current nuclear weapons arsenals possessed
by states -- about 14,550 warheads, all of which carry the risk of
intentional or unintentional use -- [the **threat of nuclear terrorism**
is here and **increasing**. For more than a decade, **Al Qaeda**, **Aum
Shinrikyo**, and]{.underline} other **[[terrorist
groups]{.underline}]{.mark}** have [expressed]{.underline} their
[[desire]{.mark} to **acquire fissile material** to **build** and
**detonate** [a]{.mark}]{.underline}n improvised [[nuclear bomb.
None]{.underline}]{.mark} of them [[could]{.mark} fulfill that goal --
[so far.]{.mark}]{.underline} But [[that does not mean]{.mark} that
[they will not succeed]{.mark} in the future.]{.underline} Making
matters worse, [there is evidence of an **illicit market** for **nuclear
weapons-usable materials**. There are sellers in search of potential
buyers]{.underline}, as shown by the dismantlement of a nuclear
smuggling network in Moldova in 2015. [There certainly are plenty of
sites from which to obtain nuclear material.]{.underline} According to
the 2016 Nuclear Security Index by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, [24
countries]{.underline} still [host inventories of nuclear weapons-usable
materials, stored in **facilities** with **different degrees of
security**.]{.underline} And in terms of risk, it is not necessary for a
given country to possess nuclear weapons, weapons-usable materials, or
nuclear facilities for it to be useful to nuclear terrorists:
[[**Structural**]{.mark} and **institutional [weaknesses]{.mark} in a
country** may [make it favorable for]{.mark} the [**illicit trade of
materials**.]{.mark} **Permeable boundaries**, high levels of
**corruption**, **weaknesses in judicial systems**, and consequent
**impunity** may give rise to a series of transactions]{.underline} and
other events, [which could **end in a nuclear attack**.]{.underline} The
truth is that, at this stage, [[no country in possession of]{.mark}
nuclear weapons or weapons-usable [materials can guarantee their full
protection]{.mark}]{.underline} against nuclear terrorism or nuclear
smuggling. Because we live in a world of growing insecurity, where
explicit and tacit agreements between the relevant powers -- which
upheld global stability during the post-Cold War -- are giving way to
increasing mistrust and hostility, a question arises: How would our
lives be affected if a current terrorist group such as the Islamic State
(ISIS), or new terrorist groups in the future, succeed in evolving from
today's Manchester style "low-tech" attacks to a "high-tech" one,
involving a nuclear bomb, detonated in a capital city, anywhere in the
world? We attempted to answer this question in a report developed by a
high-level multidisciplinary expert group convened by the NPSGlobal
Foundation for the Latin American and Caribbean Leadership Network. We
found that there would be multiple harmful effects that would spread
promptly around the globe (Arguello and Buis 2016); a more detailed
analysis is below, which highlights the need for the creation of a
comprehensive nuclear security system. The consequences of a terrorist
nuclear attack [[A **small**]{.mark} and **primitive**]{.underline}
1-kiloton [[fission]{.mark} bomb]{.underline} (with a yield of about
one-fifteenth of the one dropped on Hiroshima, and certainly much less
sophisticated; cf. Figure 1), [detonated in any]{.underline} large
capital [city]{.underline} of the developed world, [[would cause]{.mark}
an [**unprecedented catastrophic scenario**.]{.mark}]{.underline} An
estimate of direct effects in the attack's location includes a death
toll of 7,300-to-23,000 people and 12,600-to-57,000 people injured,
depending on the target's geography and population density. [**Total
physical destruction** of the city's infrastructure, due to the
**blast**]{.underline} (shock wave) [and thermal
**radiation**]{.underline}, would cover a radius of about 500 meters
from the point of detonation (also known as ground zero), while ionizing
radiation greater than 5 Sieverts -- compatible with the deadly acute
radiation syndrome -- would expand within an 850-meter radius. From the
environmental point of view, [such an area would be unusable for
years.]{.underline} In addition, radioactive fallout would expand in an
area of about 300 square kilometers, depending on meteorological
conditions (cf. Figure 2). But the [consequences would go far beyond the
effects in the target country]{.underline}, however, [and]{.underline}
promptly [**propagate worldwide**.]{.underline} Global and national
security, economy and finance, international governance and its
framework, national political systems, and the behavior of governments
and individuals would all be put under severe trial. The severity of the
effects at a national level, however, would depend on the countries'

### North Korea

#### Strategic intel based OCOs enables successful damage limitation against North Korea

**Long 17**---Senior Political Scientist at the RAND Corporation and
non-resident Senior Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. He
was previously an Associate Professor at Columbia University's School of
International and Public Affairs \[Austin, 2017, "A cyber SIOP?
Operational considerations for strategic offensive cyber planning",
Journal of Cybersecurity, 3(1), 19--28, doi: 10.1093/cybsec/tyw016,
Accessed through the Wake Forest Library\] AMarb

In contrast, [**strategic [OCO]{.mark}** [may]{.mark} be very useful for
[achiev]{.mark}ing **[damage limitation]{.mark} objectives**,
particularly [against]{.mark}]{.underline} regional powers like
[**[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Indeed former
Deputy Secretary of Defense John [Harvey]{.underline} has [called for a
comprehensive [effort to **negate** ]{.mark}**North [Korea's nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}**[, including: **Cyber capabilities to disrupt warhead
arming and firing systems**, or **cause flaws to be
introduced**]{.mark}]{.underline} into warhead designs, [[so]{.mark}
that [any **arriving warheads are duds**.]{.mark}]{.underline} On this
last point, foreign "assistance" to North Korea's nuclear program is a
problem, but it is also an opportunity. Under such conditions, [North
Korea's [leaders would no longer "**own**" their nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline} --- in a sense, we would. A bit fanciful?
Not necessarily. The [technologies, subsystems and capabilities exist
today to address each one of these goals notwithstanding the need for a
bit of luck here and there. [It is **well within** ]{.mark}**the realm
of [technical possibility]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[23\]. Thus, [**the
target choice would be less restricted** in planning for damage
limitation than in escalation control]{.underline} -- essentially
[**[everything would be fair game]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Yet this has
escalation risks unique to OCO -- establishing the accesses needed for
OCO could be escalatory, as discussed in the next section.

#### Damage limitation based on intelligence solves a nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula

A [[central element]{.mark} of U.S. long-term strategy [for deterring a
nuclear-armed North Korea]{.mark}]{.underline} and assuring South Korea
and Japan [[should b]{.mark}e to maintain [robust
"**d**]{.mark}amage-**[l]{.mark}**imitation **capabilities**" [to keep
pace with]{.mark} North Korea's **[advancing nuclear
forces]{.mark}**.]{.underline} By damage-limitation capabilities, we
mean military capabilities that would allow the United States -- in a
conflict -- to use offensive and defensive means to significantly reduce
North Korea's ability to conduct successful nuclear strikes against it
and its allies. Broadly, [[these]{.mark} capabilities would
[include]{.mark}]{.underline} three key elements:
**[[intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) [[capabilities to locate and track]{.mark} North
Korean nuclear [forces, strike capabilities to]{.mark}]{.underline}
~~disable~~ [\[[stop\] nuclear-armed delivery vehicles]{.mark} or
disrupt their command and control]{.underline}, and defenses to
intercept nuclear-armed missiles once North Korea has launched them.

Of course, [the United States has significant ISR, strike, and missile
defense capabilities today. But [as No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea['s]{.mark} nuclear weapons [force becomes larger
and]{.mark} more [sophisticated, the **U**]{.mark}**nited
[S]{.mark}tates [will need to keep pace]{.mark}**, which will
require]{.underline} examining North Korean nuclear forces as a network
and ensuring [that the United States has the appropriate tools to
exploit weak points.]{.underline} One key shortcoming of the current
U.S. posture is an overreliance on nuclear weapons to conduct strikes
against North Korea's nuclear forces.43 [Massive nuclear strikes may not
be credible in Pyongyang's eyes]{.underline}, making it critical that
the United States improve its conventional options, particularly against
high-value targets like ICBMs. This might involve the deployment of
additional strike platforms to the Korean peninsula or the fielding of
intercontinental-range conventional strike capabilities.44

[[Robust d]{.mark}amage-[l]{.mark}imitation capabilities [will help the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates disabuse Kim]{.underline} Jong Un [of the
idea that he can use or threaten to use nuclear weapons to terminate a
conventional conflict. Pyongyang knows it cannot match the full military
potential of the United States.]{.underline} As a result, [**[Kim has
incentives to use nuc]{.mark}lear [weapons]{.mark}** [against U.S.
forces]{.mark} and bases in the region]{.underline}, while relying on
the threat of significant nuclear attacks against U.S. and allied cities
to convince the United States to stop fighting.45

But [if Kim and his advisers fear]{.underline} that [the United States
will execute strikes to destroy their nuclear forces]{.underline} --
either to preempt its nuclear use during a conventional conflict or to
retaliate against a limited nuclear strike --[then they will have
**dramatically less confidence** in their ability to coerce or
intimidate through the threat or use of force.]{.underline} Recognizing
this military disadvantage, [Pyongyang will be less likely to go on the
offensive]{.underline}, in peacetime or in crisis, or to attempt to end
a conflict by conducting limited nuclear strikes.

[Washington]{.underline}, on the other hand, [would have greater
confidence in its **ability to deter**]{.underline} -- and if necessary
mitigate -- **[nuclear escalation]{.underline}**, which should increase
U.S. willingness to stand with allies in the face of aggression. For
allies, U.S. damage-limitation capabilities would help to assure them of
the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence despite advancing North
Korean nuclear capabilities.46

Lastly, damage-limitation capabilities provide Washington with an option
to reduce harm to the United States and its allies. [[A **conflict on
the Korean peninsula could spiral out of control**]{.mark} despite U.S.
efforts to de-escalate.]{.underline} Imagine North Korea launching
several nuclear strikes and preparing more, regardless of the
consequences. In this scenario, the United States and its allies may
determine that deterring the next wave of nuclear attacks is not viable
and instead seek to disarm North Korea's nuclear forces. The [[right mix
of]{.mark} offensive and defensive [capabilities would
save]{.mark}]{.underline} thousands if not
**[[millions]{.underline}]{.mark}** of American, Korean, and Japanese
lives.

### China

#### Chinese cyber hacking through OCOs enables successful military modernization to overtake the US

**Johnson 19**---Senior staff writer at FCW, covering governmentwide IT
policy, cybersecurity and a range of other federal technology issues
\[Derek B. Johnson, 5/6/2019, "How China uses cyber theft and
information warfare", FCW,

AMarb

[[Beijing is leveraging]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly sophisticated
[[cyber op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} and widespread theft of
technological secrets in the digital domain [as one]{.mark} of the
**[key pillar]{.mark}s** [of **its military** ]{.mark}**modernization
strategy**]{.underline}, a new Pentagon report finds.

Cyber and information operations are two areas that are seeing increased
investment and emphasis from the Chinese military, according to the
report. [While traditional intelligence gathering remains an important
goal, the use of cyber capabilities to conduct **economic
[espionage]{.mark}** [has taken]{.mark} greater
[precedence]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent years.

This [[strategy not only helps]{.mark} to [fuel]{.mark} the
**[tech]{.mark}nological [mod]{.mark}ernization** of the]{.underline}
People\'s Liberation Army [(PLA) and other military and intelligence
branches, [but by **targeting the U.S. d**]{.mark}**efense
[i]{.mark}ndustrial [b]{.mark}ase**, [it]{.mark} **simultaneously
[closes]{.mark} the [gap in capability]{.mark}** [between China and its
greatest]{.mark} military [rival.]{.mark}]{.underline}

That reality has forced policymakers in Washington to respond by more
aggressively prosecuting and confronting Chinese-directed extralegal
activity targeting U.S. technology while giving greater scrutiny to more
legal avenues, such as foreign direct investment and research
partnerships between U.S. universities and Chinese entities.

While discussing the report, Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Randall [Schriver characterized the threat
posed by China\'s cyber capabilities as \"**persistent**.\"]{.underline}

\"The [[Chinese remain]{.mark} very [aggressive]{.mark} in their use of
cyber]{.underline},\" Schriver said. \"[[What\'s changed is **our**
]{.mark}**level of [awareness]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the [**steps we\'re
taking** to reduce]{.mark} our own vulnerabilities and **working [with
partners and allies]{.mark}** []{.mark}to do the same.]{.underline}\"

The report argues that the Chinese government is slowly incentivizing
its civilian sector to align its goals and activities with the defense
market. The report maintains that the Made in China 2025 plan \-- a list
of technologies and industrial sectors that China aims to dominate by
2025 \-- \"directly support\[s\] military modernization goals by
stressing proprietary mastery of advanced dual-use technologies.\"

U.S. officials also believe the plan is driving cyber and
espionage-related theft of U.S. trade secrets. A Navy report earlier
this year documented how [[Chinese hackers were stealing so much
i]{.mark}ntellectual [p]{.mark}roperty and classified secrets that it
was \"[**materially eroding**\" **U.S. economic and military
advantage**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Further, FBI officials have claimed
that since 2015, the Department of Justice has charged Chinese
individuals and entities for stealing trade secrets in eight out the 10
sectors listed in the Made in China 2025 plan.

\"[China uses a variety of methods to acquire foreign military and
dual-use technologies, including]{.underline} targeted foreign direct
investment, **[cyber theft]{.underline}**, and exploitation of private
Chinese nationals\' access to these technologies, as well as harnessing
its intelligence services, computer intrusions, and other illicit
approaches,\" the report states.

The [PLA]{.underline} also [centralized its space, cyber, electronic and
psychological warfare operations]{.underline} under a new organization
\-- [the Strategic Support Force]{.underline} \-- in 2016. The
restructuring seeks to remedy operational coordination challenges that
hindered information sharing under the pre-reform organizational
structure, and the Pentagon believes it will help yield greater synergy
among the different domains. [It will]{.underline} also [make it easier
for the PLA to implement \"**information blockades**\" during or prior
to a conflict, denying the enemy the **information awareness needed** to
set the conditions for ground or air superiority later on.]{.underline}

[**[O]{.mark}**ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber **[o]{.mark}**peration[s are
viewed by Beijing as an \"effective\" means for countering a stronger
foe.]{.mark} Chinese cyber operations target critical military and
civilian nodes, such as **c**ommand **and c**ontrol servers]{.underline}
and logistics networks, to \"deter or disrupt adversary intervention,
and to retain the option to scale these attacks to achieve desired
conditions with minimal strategic cost.\"

#### Chinese technological supremacy upends the balance of power ensuring nuclear Armageddon

Recently, analysts have argued that emerging technologies with military
applications may undermine nuclear stability (see here, here, and here),
but the logic of these arguments is debatable and overlooks a more
straightforward reason why [[new tech]{.mark}nology [might cause
**nuclear conflict**: by **upending** the]{.mark} **existing [balance of
power]{.mark}** among nuclear-armed states. This latter concern is more
probable and dangerous and demands an immediate policy
response.]{.underline} For more than 70 years, the world has avoided
major power conflict, and many attribute this era of peace to nuclear
weapons. In situations of mutually assured destruction (MAD), neither
side has an incentive to start a conflict because doing so will only
result in its own annihilation. The key to this model of deterrence is
the maintenance of secure second-strike capabilities---the ability to
absorb an enemy nuclear attack and respond with a devastating
counterattack. Recently analysts have begun to worry, however, that [new
strategic military technologies may make it possible for a state to
conduct a successful first strike on an enemy.]{.underline} For example,
Chinese colleagues have complained to me in Track II dialogues that the
United States may decide to launch a sophisticated cyberattack against
Chinese nuclear command and control, essentially turning off China's
nuclear forces. Then, Washington will follow up with a massive strike
with conventional cruise and hypersonic missiles to destroy China's
nuclear weapons. Finally, if any Chinese forces happen to survive, the
United States can simply mop up China's ragged retaliatory strike with
advanced missile defenses. China will be disarmed and US nuclear weapons
will still be sitting on the shelf, untouched. If the United States, or
any other state acquires such a first-strike capability, then the logic
of MAD would be undermined. Washington may be tempted to launch a
nuclear first strike. Or China may choose instead to use its nuclear
weapons early in a conflict before they can be wiped out---the so-called
"use 'em or lose 'em" problem. According to this logic, therefore, the
appropriate policy response would be to ban outright or control any new
weapon systems that might threaten second-strike capabilities. This way
of thinking about new technology and stability, however, is open to
question. Would any US president truly decide to launch a massive,
bolt-out-of-the-blue nuclear attack because he or she thought s/he could
get away with it? And why does it make sense for the country in the
inferior position, in this case China, to intentionally start a nuclear
war that it will almost certainly lose? More important, this
conceptualization of how new technology affects stability is too narrow,
focused exclusively on how new military technologies might be used
against nuclear forces directly. Rather, [we should think more broadly
about how new technology might affect global politics, and, for this, it
is helpful to turn to scholarly international relations theory. The
**dominant theory** of the causes of war in the academy is the
"**bargaining model of war**." This theory identifies **rapid shifts**
in the **balance of power** as a **primary cause of
conflict**.]{.underline} International politics often presents states
with conflicts that they can settle through peaceful bargaining, but
when bargaining breaks down, war results. [[Shifts]{.mark} in the
**balance of power** are problematic because they **[undermine]{.mark}
effective [bargaining]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} After all, [why
agree to a deal today if your bargaining position will be stronger
tomorrow? [And]{.mark}, a clear understanding of the military balance of
power can contribute to peace. (Why start a war you are likely to lose?)
But shifts in the balance of power [muddy understandings]{.mark} of
which states have the advantage.]{.underline} You may see where this is
going. [[New tech]{.mark}nologies threaten to [create]{.mark}
potentially **[destabilizing shifts]{.mark}** in the balance of
power.]{.underline} For decades, stability in Europe and Asia has been
supported by US military power. In recent years, however, the [balance
of power in Asia has begun to shift, as **China has increased its
military capabilities**.]{.underline} Already, [Beijing has become more
assertive in the region, claiming contested territory in the South China
Sea.]{.underline} And the results of Russia's military modernization
have been on full display in its ongoing intervention in Ukraine.
Moreover, [[China may have]{.mark} the [lead]{.mark} over the United
States [in emerging tech]{.mark}nologies [that could be **decisive**
for]{.mark} the [future]{.mark} of **military acquisitions** and
**[warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including 3D printing, hypersonic
missiles, quantum computing, 5G wireless connectivity, and artificial
intelligence (AI). And Russian President Vladimir Putin is building new
unmanned vehicles while ominously declaring, "Whoever leads in AI will
rule the world." If China or Russia are able to incorporate new
technologies into their militaries before the United States, then this
could lead to the kind of rapid shift in the balance of power that often
causes war. [If Beijing believes emerging technologies provide it with a
newfound, local military advantage over the United States, for example,
it may be more willing than previously **to initiate conflict over
Taiwan**.]{.underline} And if Putin thinks new tech has strengthened his
hand, he may be more tempted to launch a Ukraine-style invasion of a
NATO member. [Either scenario could bring these **nuclear powers into
direct conflict** with the United States, and **once nuclear armed
states are at war**, [there is]{.mark} an [**inherent risk** of
**nuclear conflict** through]{.mark} limited nuclear war strategies,
nuclear **[brinkmanship]{.mark}**, or simple [**accident** or
**inadvertent escalation**.]{.mark}]{.underline} This framing of the
problem leads to a different set of policy implications. The concern is
not simply technologies that threaten to undermine nuclear second-strike
capabilities directly, but, rather, any technologies that can result in
a meaningful shift in the broader balance of power. And [the solution
is]{.underline} not to preserve second-strike capabilities, but to
[**preserve prevailing power balances** more broadly.]{.underline} When
it comes to new technology, this means that the United States should
seek to maintain an innovation edge. [Washington should]{.underline}
also [work with other states, including its nuclear-armed rivals, to
develop a **new set of arms control**]{.underline} and nonproliferation
agreements and export controls to deny these newer and potentially
destabilizing technologies to potentially hostile states. [These are no
easy tasks, but the consequences of Washington losing the race for
**technological superiority** to its **autocratic challengers** just
might mean **nuclear Armageddon**.]{.underline}
