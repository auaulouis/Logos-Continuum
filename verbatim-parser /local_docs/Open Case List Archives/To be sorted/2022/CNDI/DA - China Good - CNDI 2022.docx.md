# China Good DAs

### Notes: 

It's basically an impact turn to the aff -- China needs to win the AI
race, not the US. It's key to their economy (decline causes war). It's
key to Chinese leadership (multipolarity better). And beating China
pushes them to a permanent alliance with Russia.

Almost all the link arg are specific to Artificial Intelligence. Many
arguments the neg needs to win (innovation is zero-sum, plan hurts
China, etc) are args made in the AI 1AC. CX can help with this too.

All this means that many of these cards can be used to improve the
impact work for the AI aff. As you'll see there are plenty of hegemony
good/bad cards and China peaceful/violent cards.

The past few decades have witnessed [many advances in computing and
artificial intelligence (AI)-related approaches,]{.underline} due to
progress in machine learning, computer processing power, the
accessibility of mobile internet, the availability of large amounts of
data and data storage technology. This has [triggered a series of
breakthroughs that enabled [AI]{.mark} to become **[an engine for
economic development]{.mark}** in many countries[, including
**China**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We expect that [**[AI will redefine
all]{.mark} aspects of [economic activities]{.mark}** and will lead to
new demands, new products, new technologies and new forms of businesses
of all sizes.]{.underline} [[China should seize the opportunity and
trigger a major **evolution** of the economic
structure]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Furthermore, we believe that Chinese
AI researchers can make great scientific contributions to mankind. In
the past 300 years, Western societies have been responsible for major
scientific achievements. Today, in the era of AI, China can contribute
to important scientific progress, building an open international
research platform, and working with researchers and engineers from
around the world to tackle the grand challenges that we are facing. An
AI plan for a new generation In January 2016, [the Chinese Academy of
Engineering launched a major strategic consulting research project
called AI 2.0 in China]{.underline}. During the launch ceremony, held in
March 2016, the attending researchers decided to write a letter to the
Chinese government to propose the initiation of megaprojects in AI. In
the following months, led by the Ministry of Science and Technology of
China, more than 220 AI experts from universities, institutes, companies
and governments attended discussions and contributed to drafting the New
Generation of Artificial Intelligence (NGAI) Development Plan. In August
2016, according to the State Council, 15 [megaprojects with the
implementation period ending in 2030 were announced to reflect and
incorporate new developments and trends in both national and
international science and technology priorities and needs]{.underline}.
As the 16th programme, the NGAI Development Plan (2015-- 2030) was
launched in July 2017 by the Chinese State Council1 , [the first
systematic and strategic plan in AI for China in this century. It sets
out a national top-level plan for the overall thinking, strategic goals,
main tasks and supporting measures for China's AI development through
2030 via three successional steps]{.underline}. First, by the end of
2020, **[[China will close the technological gap with world-leading
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and **[China's AI industry will
compete at the highest international level]{.underline}**. Second,
**[[by 2025, China will have]{.mark} achieved [significant
breakthroughs]{.mark} in fundamental research of AI]{.underline}** and
formulated the framework of NGAI, with some technologies and
applications achieving a world-leading level[, [and AI becoming the
**main driving force for China's industrial upgrade and economic
transformation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Third, [[by 2030, China is
expected to become one of the **world's premier AI innovation
centres**,]{.mark} and will have developed comprehensive and appropriate
regulatory, legal and ethical principles for AI
development]{.underline}. By following the Development Plan, [China's
new-generation AI is positioned to transform big data into structured
knowledge and support human decision making]{.underline} (big data
intelligence)2--5 . In addition, it will be able to employ data with
different modalities (for example, visual, auditory and natural
language) to perform learning and inference (cross-media intelligence)6
and harness the intelligence of crowds to address complicated challenges
in a paradigm of computational collective wisdom (crowd intelligence)7 .
Furthermore, [there will be a step from the pursuit of an intelligent
machine to the hybrid-augmented intelligence]{.underline}
(human--machine hybrid intelligence)8 . The new-generation [AI will also
emphasize intelligent systems capable of carrying out operations without
human intervention]{.underline} (intelligent autonomous systems)9 .
Unlike AI strategies outlined by other countries, China's AI plan not
only consists of science and technology issues, but also provides
guidelines regarding education and ethics. The AI plan is intended to
cultivate an AI ecosystem in China. Collaboration between universities,
government and industry To enable leading AI-related enterprises to
fully commit to addressing AI technologies and application demands of
NGAI, in the past years the Ministry of Science and Technology
established 15 National Open Innovation Platforms based on
application-driven, enterprise-led and market-oriented principles,
including Baidu (autonomous driving), Alibaba (urban cognition), Tencent
(medical imaging), iFlyTek (voice intelligence), Sensetime (intelligent
vision), Yitu Technology (visual computing), MiningLamp Technology
(marketing intelligence), Huawei (basic software and hardware), Ping An
(inclusive finance), Hikvision (video perception), Jingdong (intelligent
supply chain), Megvii (image perception), Qihoo 360 (safe brain), TAL
Education Group (smart education) and Xiaomi (smart home). To promote
cooperation with local governments for demonstrating AI technologies and
to pilot experimental policies for AI development, replicable in other
areas of the country at a later stage[, [China will construct around 20
new]{.mark} National NGAI [Development]{.mark} Experimental [Zones by
2023]{.mark}]{.underline}. Currently, Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei,
Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Chong Qing, Cheng Du, Xi'an, Ji Nan and the
county of Deqing have been selected as new zones. In 2018 and 2020, [the
Ministry of Science and Technology issued two calls for proposals for
megaprojects of 'science and technology innovation 2030---New Generation
Artificial Intelligence']{.underline}. The calls focus on fundamental AI
theories (neural network, causal inference, game theory, collective
wisdom, hybrid intelligence and brain-inspired intelligence),
technologies (knowledge computing, adaptive perception and artificial
systems and applications) and AI chips. In China, the National Natural
Science Foundation of China (NSFC) supports basic research, fosters
talented researchers, develops international cooperation and promotes
socioeconomic development. In 2018, AI and cross-disciplinary
information sciences were newly added into the Directorate of
Information Sciences of NSFC, which means that universities and
institutes are eligible to apply funding from NSFC to AI. [[China's
government has become **increasingly active** in setting up a
**collaborative innovation** system via the interactions among
universities, government and industry for AI
development]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Based on the collaboration,
universities, funding agencies, enterprises, and central and [local
governments in China have been connected together to develop **the new
generation of AI**.]{.underline}

#### Chinese economic collapse leads to war - miscalculation and lash out

**Carpenter, 15** -- \[Ted Galen, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute
and a contributing editor at The National Interest, The National
Interest, "Could China\'s Economic Troubles Spark a War?", 9/6/15,
<http://nationalinterest.org/feature/could-chinas-economic-troubles-spark-war-13784?page=2>,
6/24/16\]

Global attention has focused on the plunge in the Shanghai stock market
and mounting evidence that China's economic growth is slowing
dramatically. Moreover, the contagion appears to be spreading,
characterized by extreme volatility and alarming declines in America's
own equity markets. Those worries are compounded because there always
have been doubts about the accuracy of Beijing's official economic
statistics. Even before the current downturn, some outside experts
believed that Chinese officials padded the results, making the country's
performance appear stronger than it actually was. If China is now
teetering on the brink of recession, the political incentives for
officials to conceal the extent of the damage would be quite powerful.
[The focus on the [possible wider economic consequences of a severe
Chinese economic slowdown is understandable]{.mark}, since the
ramifications could be extremely unpleasant for the U.S. and global
economies]{.underline}. But [we should also be vigilant about
how]{.underline} such [economic stress might affect Beijing's diplomatic
and military behavior. It is not unprecedented for a government that
feels besieged to attempt to distract a discontented public by fomenting
a foreign policy crisis.]{.underline} In Henry IV, Shakespeare pithily
described that process as the temptation to "busy giddy minds with
foreign quarrels." [China's leaders likely feel increasingly
uncomfortable.]{.underline} The implicit bargain that has been in place
since the onset of market-oriented reforms in the late 1970s has been
that if the public does not challenge the Communist Party's dominant
political position, the Party will deliver an ever-rising standard of
living for the people. The bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 was
a graphic reminder of what happens if the Party's position is
challenged. However, until now, the economic portion of the bargain
seemed secure, characterized by breathtaking, often double digit, rates
of growth. It is uncertain what happens [if the Party can no longer
maintain its part of the implicit bargain]{.underline}, but [it is
likely that a dangerous degree of public discontent will
surface]{.underline}. Beijing might refrain from deliberately provoking
a major foreign policy crisis, since the Chinese economy depends heavily
on export markets, and access to those markets would be jeopardized by
war. However, [[the need to preserve and strengthen national unity and
distract the public from mounting economic troubles is likely to impel
Chinese leaders to adopt very hardline policies]{.mark} in at least
three areas.]{.underline} [[And all of those]{.mark} situations
[entail]{.mark} the danger of [miscalc]{.mark}ulations [that could lead
to war]{.mark}. [One issue is the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea.]{.underline} Beijing has made extraordinarily broad
territorial claims that encompass some 90 percent of that body of water.
China is pressing its claims with air and naval patrols and the building
of artificial islands. [[Those policies have brought Beijing
into]{.mark} acrimonious [disputes with]{.mark}]{.underline} neighbors
such as [[Vietnam and the Philippines]{.mark}, which have rival
territorial claims, and with the world's leading maritime power, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, which [resists]{.mark} any manifestation
of [Chinese control over the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea
and the crucial commercial lanes that pass through it. The conditions
are in place for a nasty confrontation.]{.underline} [[Chinese leaders
have already stressed the country's alleged historical claims to the
area]{.underline}]{.mark}, and made it clear that it will not tolerate
being subjected to humiliation by outside powers. [Such [arguments are
designed to gain domestic support by reminding the Chinese people of the
country's]{.mark} long period of weakness and [humiliation in the 1800s
and]{.mark} early [1900s. A second issue is Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Beijing has long argued that Taiwan is rightfully part of China and was
stolen from the country in the Sino-Japanese war in 1895.]{.underline}
[Although Chinese leaders have exhibited patience regarding the issue of
reunification]{.underline}, [relying in large measure on growing
cross-strait economic ties to entice Taiwan to eventually accept that
outcome]{.underline}, Beijing has also reacted very sharply whenever
Taiwanese officials have pushed an agenda of independence, as during the
administration of Chen Shui-bian from 2000 to 2008. [[The danger]{.mark}
or renewed [confrontation is rising]{.mark}, since public opinion
polls]{.underline} [indicate that the nominee of Chen's old party, the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, will be Taiwan's next
leader]{.underline}. [[A new crisis in the Taiwan Strait would
be]{.mark} extremely [serious, since the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[has obligated itself to consider any Chinese efforts at coercion as a
"grave breach of the peace" of East Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet there
is little doubt that there would be widespread domestic support on the
mainland for a stern response by the Beijing government to a Taiwanese
attempt to enhance its de-facto independence. Indeed, there might be
more political danger to the regime if it did not take a strong stance
on that issue. [[The third]{.mark} possible arena for crisis [is the
East China Sea]{.mark}]{.underline}. [China is increasingly adamant
about its claims to the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, which are under Japanese
control]{.underline}. [[From China's perspective, those islands were
stolen by]{.mark} Imperial [Japan]{.mark}]{.underline} at the same time
that Tokyo took possession of Taiwan following the 1895 war. And
[ginning up public anger against Japan is never difficult]{.underline}.
China just finished celebrating the 70th anniversary of the end of World
War II, which is touted in China as "the Chinese People's War of
Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War."
[Recalling Japan's invasion of China, and the resulting atrocities, was
a prominent theme of]{.underline} the various [commemorative
events]{.underline}. But the animosity is not based solely on historical
grievances[. [Anger at Japan over the]{.mark} ongoing [East China
Sea]{.mark} dispute and other matters [has]{.mark} already [produced
anti-Japanese riots in Chinese cities]{.mark}, characterized by attacks
on Japanese businesses and automobiles]{.underline}. [[There is a
powerful incentive for Chinese leaders to take an uncompromising stance
on the Diaoyu/Senkaku]{.mark} feud, confident that the Chinese people
will back such a stance.]{.underline} All of this suggests that the
United States and its allies need to proceed cautiously about dealing
with China, especially on these three issues. Now is not the time to
press a Chinese leadership that likely feels beleaguered by the
country's economic woes. [[The last thing we should do is give those
leaders further temptation to distract the Chinese people with a foreign
policy confrontation]{.mark}. Such a strategy entails the grave risk of
miscalculation and escalation, and that would be a tragedy for all
concerned]{.underline}.

### 1nc -- China Leadership

#### China leadership on emerging tech key to their leadership model -- it's the only way they'll maintain a position of power. 

Jake **Sullivan,** Hal **Brands,** 5-22-20**20**, (Jacob Sullivan serves
as the United States National Security Advisor to Biden, \"China Has Two
Paths To Global Domination,\" Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace,

\-- sri

[In short, it is not clear that Beijing can successfully take a regional
path to global power---which raises the question of whether there may be
a second road to **Chinese global leadership**]{.underline}. What if,
instead of focusing on regional hegemony before turning to consider
global hegemony, China approaches things the other way around? This
second road would lead China more to its west than to its east, in
service of building a new Chinese-led security and economic order across
the Eurasian land mass and Indian Ocean, while establishing Chinese
centrality in global institutions. In this approach, [China would
grudgingly accept that it could not displace the United States from Asia
or push the U.S. Navy beyond the Western Pacific's first island chain,
at least for the foreseeable future. It would instead put increasing
emphasis on shaping the world's economic rules, technology standards,
and political institutions to its advantage and in its
image.]{.underline} **[The central premises of this alternative approach
would be that economic and technological power is fundamentally more
important than traditional military power in establishing global
leadership]{.underline}**, and that a physical sphere of influence in
East Asia is not a necessary precondition for sustaining such
leadership. By this logic, China could simply keep managing a military
balance in the Western Pacific---attending to its immediate periphery
and especially its territorial claims through its anti-access/area
-denial doctrine, and slowly shifting the correlation of forces in its
favor---while pursuing global dominance through these other forms of
power. China could simply keep managing a military balance in the
Western Pacific while pursuing global dominance through these other
forms of power. Here, Beijing would consider a different variation of
the U.S. analogy. U.S. leadership of the international order that
emerged after World War II and was consolidated after the end of the
Cold War rested on at least three critical factors. [First, the ability
to convert **economic might** into political influence. Second, the
maintenance of an **innovation** advantage over the rest of the world.
And third, the capacity to shape the key international institutions and
set the **key rules** of global conduct.]{.underline} In traveling this
second road, **[China would seek to replicate these
factors]{.underline}**. This would start with the widening ambition of
the Belt Road Initiative across Eurasia and Africa. Building and
financing physical infrastructure puts China at the center of a web of
trade and economic links spanning multiple continents. [And the
**digital component** of the effort, the Digital Silk Road, advances
China's stated goal from the 2017 Party Congress of becoming a
"cyber-superpower," by deploying Chinese foundational technologies,
driving standard-setting in international bodies, and securing long-term
commercial advantages for Chinese firms]{.underline}. (There are
indications that China is even using its head-start in recovering from
the coronavirus to advance this agenda by claiming additional market
share in key industries where competitors are temporarily laid low.)
[Combining an aggressive foreign economic policy with massive
state-directed domestic investments in innovation, **China could emerge
as the leading player in foundational technologies from artificial
intelligence to quantum computing to biotechnology**]{.underline}. [As
China builds economic power through these efforts, it will sharpen its
capacity to convert that power into geopolitical influence]{.underline}.
Carnegie's Evan Feigenbaum has identified multiple types of leverage
China can use to "lock in its political and economic preferences,"
ranging from latent-and-passive to active-and-coercive. He assesses that
Beijing will keep refining a "mix and match" strategy that deploys the
full range of these tools in dust-ups with a diverse array of countries,
from South Korea to Mongolia to Norway. Eventually, China may well adapt
a more systematic ladder of escalation to produce preferred outcomes.

#### Maintaining a path for Chinese leadership stops great power wars -- China is worse when they're in decline.

[[Why do great powers fight great wars]{.mark}? The conventional answer
is a story of rising challengers and declining hegemons.]{.underline} An
ascendant power, which chafes at the rules of the existing order, gains
ground on an established power---the country that made those rules.
Tensions multiply; tests of strength ensue. The outcome is a spiral of
fear and hostility leading, almost inevitably, to conflict. "The growth
of the power of Athens, and the alarm which this inspired in Sparta,
made war inevitable," the ancient historian Thucydides wrote---a truism
now invoked, ad nauseum, in explaining the U.S.-China rivalry. The idea
of a Thucydides Trap, popularized by Harvard political scientist Graham
Allison, holds that the danger of war will skyrocket as a surging China
overtakes a sagging America. Even Chinese President Xi Jinping has
endorsed the concept arguing Washington must make room for Beijing[. As
tensions between the United States and China escalate, the belief that
the fundamental cause of friction is a looming "power transition"---the
replacement of one hegemon by another---has become canonical. **The only
problem with this familiar formula is that it's wrong**.]{.underline}
The Thucydides Trap doesn't really explain what caused the Peloponnesian
War. [It doesn't capture the dynamics that have often driven revisionist
powers---whether that is Germany in 1914 or Japan in 1941---to start
some of history's most devastating conflicts. And it doesn't explain why
**[war is a very real possibility in U.S.-China]{.mark}** relations
today because it fundamentally misdiagnoses where China now finds itself
on its arc of development---**[the point at which its relative
power]{.mark} is peaking and will soon start to
[fade]{.mark}.**]{.underline} There's indeed a deadly trap that could
ensnare the United States and China. But it's not the product of a power
transition the Thucydidean cliché says it is. [It's best thought of
instead as [a "**peaking power trap.**]{.mark}**"** And if history [is
a]{.mark}ny [guide]{.mark}, **[it's China's]{.mark}---not the United
States'[---impending decline that could cause it to snap shut.]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}There is an entire swath of literature, known as "power
transition theory," which holds that great-power war typically occurs at
the intersection of one hegemon's rise and another's
decline.]{.underline} This is the body of work underpinning the
Thucydides Trap, and there is, admittedly, an elemental truth to the
idea. The rise of new powers is invariably destabilizing. In the runup
to the Peloponnesian War in the 5th century B.C., Athens would not have
seemed so menacing to Sparta had it not built a vast empire and become a
naval superpower. Washington and Beijing would not be locked in rivalry
if China was still poor and weak. Rising powers do expand their
influence in ways that threaten reigning powers. But the calculus that
produces war---particularly the calculus that pushes revisionist powers,
countries seeking to shake up the existing system, to lash out
violently---is more complex[[. A country]{.mark} whose relative wealth
and power are growing will surely become more assertive and ambitious.
All things equal, it will seek greater global influence and prestige.
But **[if its position is steadily improving, it should postpone a
deadly showdown]{.mark}** with the reigning hegemon until it has become
even stronger]{.underline}. Such a country should follow the dictum
former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping laid down for a rising China after
the Cold War: It should hide its capabilities and bide its time. Now
imagine a different scenario. A dissatisfied state has been building its
power and expanding its geopolitical horizons. [[But then the country
peaks, perhaps]{.mark} because [its economy slows, perhaps]{.mark}
because its own assertiveness [provokes a coalition]{.mark} of
determined rivals, or perhaps because both of these things happen at
once. The future starts to look quite forbidding; [a sense of imminent
danger starts to replace a feeling of limitless
possibility]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In these circumstances, a
revisionist power may act boldly, even aggressively, to grab what it can
before it is too late[**. [The most dangerous trajectory in world
politics is a long rise followed by the prospect of a sharp
decline]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As we show in our forthcoming book,
Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict with China, this scenario is more
common than you might think. Historian Donald Kagan showed, for
instance, that Athens started acting more belligerently in the years
before the Peloponnesian War because it feared adverse shifts in the
balance of naval power---in other words, because it was on the verge of
losing influence vis-à-vis Sparta. We see the same thing in more recent
cases as well. [Over the past 150 years, peaking powers---great powers
that had been growing dramatically faster than the world average and
then suffered a severe, prolonged slowdown---usually don't fade away
quietly. Rather, they become brash and aggressive. They suppress dissent
at home and try to regain economic momentum by creating exclusive
spheres of influence abroad. They pour money into their militaries and
use force to expand their influence. [This behavior commonly provokes
great-power tensions. In some cases, it touches **disastrous
wars**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} This shouldn't be surprising. Eras of
rapid growth supercharge a country's ambitions, raise its people's
expectations, and make its rivals nervous. During a sustained economic
boom, businesses enjoy rising profits and citizens get used to living
large. The country becomes a bigger player on the global stage. Then
stagnation strikes. Slowing growth makes it harder for leaders to keep
the public happy. Economic underperformance weakens the country against
its rivals. Fearing upheaval, leaders crack down on dissent. They
maneuver desperately to keep geopolitical enemies at bay. Expansion
seems like a solution---a way of grabbing economic resources and
markets, making nationalism a crutch for a wounded regime, and beating
back foreign threats. Many countries have followed this path. When the
United States' long post-Civil War economic surge ended, Washington
violently suppressed strikes and unrest at home, built a powerful
blue-water Navy, and engaged in a fit of belligerence and imperial
expansion during the 1890s. After a fast-rising imperial Russia fell
into a deep slump at the turn of the 20th century, the tsarist
government cracked down hard while also enlarging its military, seeking
colonial gains in East Asia and sending around 170,000 soldiers to
occupy Manchuria. These moves backfired spectacularly: They antagonized
Japan, which beat Russia in the first great-power war of the 20th
century. [A century later, Russia became aggressive under similar
circumstances. Facing a severe, post-2008 economic slowdown, Russian
President Vladimir Putin invaded two neighboring countries, sought to
create a new Eurasian economic bloc, staked Moscow's claim to a
resource-rich Arctic, and steered Russia deeper into
dictatorship]{.underline}. Even democratic France engaged in anxious
aggrandizement after the end of its postwar economic expansion in the
1970s. It tried to rebuild its old sphere of influence in Africa,
deploying 14,000 troops to its former colonies and undertaking a dozen
military interventions over the next two decades. All of these cases
were complicated, yet the pattern is clear. [If a rapid rise gives
countries the means to act boldly, [**the fear of decline serves up a
powerful motive for rasher, more urgent expansio**n]{.mark}. The same
thing often happens when fast-rising powers cause their own containment
by a hostile coalition. In fact, some of [**history's most gruesome wars
have** come when revisionist powers concluded their path to glory was
about to be blocked.]{.mark}]{.underline} Germany's rivalry with Britain
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is often considered an
analogue to U.S.-China competition: In both cases, an autocratic
challenger threatened a liberal hegemon. But the more sobering parallel
is this: War came when a cornered Germany grasped it would not zip past
its rivals without a fight. For decades after unification in 1871,
Germany soared. Its factories spewed out iron and steel, erasing
Britain's economic lead. Berlin built Europe's finest army and
battleships that threatened British supremacy at sea. By the early
1900s, Germany was a European heavyweight seeking an enormous sphere of
influence---a Mitteleuropa, or Middle Europe­---on the continent. It was
also pursuing, under then-Kaiser Wilhelm II, a "world policy" aimed at
securing colonies and global power. But during the prelude to war, the
kaiser and his aides didn't feel confident. Germany's brash behavior
caused its encirclement by hostile powers. London, Paris, and St.
Petersburg, Russia, formed a "Triple Entente" to block German expansion.
By 1914, time was running short. Germany was losing ground economically
to a fast-growing Russia; London and France were pursuing economic
containment by blocking its access to oil and iron ore. Berlin's key
ally, Austria-Hungary, was being torn apart by ethnic tensions. At home,
Germany's autocratic political system was in trouble. Most ominous, the
military balance was shifting. France was enlarging its army; Russia was
adding 470,000 men to its military and slashing the time it needed to
mobilize for war. Britain announced it would build two battleships for
every one built by Berlin. Germany was, for the moment, Europe's
foremost military power. But by 1916 and 1917, it would be hopelessly
overmatched. The result was a now-or-never mentality: Germany should
"defeat the enemy while we still stand a chance of victory," declared
Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke, even if that meant "provoking a war
in the near future." This is what happened after Serbian nationalists
assassinated Austria's crown prince in June 1914. The kaiser's
government urged Austria-Hungary to crush Serbia, even though that meant
war with Russia and France. It then invaded neutral Belgium---the key to
its Schlieffen Plan for a two-front war---despite the likelihood of
provoking Britain. "This war will turn into a world war in which England
will also intervene," Moltke acknowledged. Germany's rise had given it
the power to gamble for greatness. Its impending decline drove the
decisions that plunged the world into war. Imperial Japan followed a
similar trajectory. For a half-century after the Meiji Restoration in
1868, Japan was rising steadily. The building of a modern economy and a
fierce military allowed Tokyo to win two major wars and accumulate
colonial privileges in China, Taiwan, and the Korean Peninsula. Yet
Japan was not a hyper-belligerent predator: Through the 1920s, it
cooperated with the United States, Britain, and other countries to
create a cooperative security framework in the Asia-Pacific. During that
decade, however, things fell apart. Growth dropped from 6.1 percent
annually between 1904 and 1919 to 1.8 percent annually in the 1920s; the
Great Depression then shut Japan's overseas markets. Unemployment
soared, and bankrupt farmers sold their daughters. In China, meanwhile,
Japanese influence was being challenged by the Soviet Union and a rising
nationalist movement under then-Chinese leader Chiang Kai-Shek. Tokyo's
answer was fascism at home and aggression abroad. From the late 1920s
onward, the military conducted a slow-motion coup and harnessed the
nation's resources for "total war." Japan initiated a massive military
buildup and violently established a vast sphere of influence, seizing
Manchuria in 1931, invading China in 1937, and laying plans to conquer
resource-rich colonies and strategic islands across the Asia-Pacific.
The goal was to build an autarkic empire; the result drew a strategic
noose around Tokyo's neck. Japan's push into China eventually led to a
punishing war with the Soviet Union. Japan's designs on Southeast Asia
alarmed Britain. Its drive for regional primacy also made it a foe of
the United States---the country from which Tokyo imported nearly all of
its oil with an economy vastly larger than Japan's. Tokyo had
antagonized an overwhelming coalition of enemies. It then risked
everything rather than accepting humiliation and decline. The
precipitating cause, again, was a closing window of opportunity. By
1941, the United States was building an unbeatable military. In July,
then-U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt imposed an oil embargo that
threatened to stop Japan's expansion in its tracks. But Japan still had
a temporary military edge in the Pacific Ocean, thanks to its early
rearmament. So it used that advantage in a lightning attack---seizing
the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and other possessions from
Singapore to Wake Island as well as bombing the U.S. fleet at Pearl
Harbor---which guaranteed its own destruction. Japan's prospects for
victory were dim, acknowledged then-Japanese Gen. Hideki Tojo, yet there
was no choice but to "close one's eyes and jump." A revisionist Japan
became most violent when it saw that time was running out. [This is the
real trap the United States should worry about regarding China
today---the trap in which an aspiring superpower peaks and then refuses
to bear the painful consequences of descent. [China's rise is no
mirage]{.mark}: Decades of growth have given Beijing the economic sinews
of global power. **[Major investments in key technologies]{.mark} and
communications infrastructure [have yielded a strong position in the
struggle for geoeconomic influence;]{.mark}**]{.underline} China is
using a multi-continent Belt and Road Initiative to bring other states
into its orbit. [Most alarming, think tank assessments and U.S. Defense
Department reports show China's increasingly formidable military now
stands a real chance of winning a war against the United States in the
Western Pacific.]{.underline} It is unsurprising, therefore, that China
has also developed the ambitions of a superpower: [Xi has more or less
announced that Beijing desires to assert its sovereignty over
**Taiwan**, the South China Sea, and other disputed areas, becoming
Asia's preeminent power and challenging the United States for global
leadership. Yet if China's geopolitical window of opportunity is real,
its future is already starting to look quite grim because it is quickly
losing the advantages that propelled its rapid growth]{.underline}

### 1nc -- Russia Alliance 

#### Sino-Russian relations are not [anti-western]{.underline} now, but the [Ukraine War]{.underline} risks pushing them into a full alliance. 

**Kaczmarski 22** (Marcin Kaczmarski is a lecturer in Security Studies,
School of Social and Political Sciences, University of Glasgow. "The war
in Ukraine and the future of Russia-China relations," 4/28/22,

[While]{.underline} the [Russia-China relationship has undoubtedly grown
in substance for the last decade]{.underline} and a half, [Moscow and
Beijing have not established a revisionist **anti-Western** alliance
yet.]{.underline} There are meaningful lim- itations as to what each
side wants to (or can) do to support the other. More often than not,
[Beijing and Moscow have engaged in parallel rather than in co-
ordinated activities,]{.underline} benefitting from the other side
drawing away attention of the West and thus increas- ing their room for
manoeuvre. [Russia's war against Ukraine is pushing Beijing to take the
decision]{.underline} it has been trying to avoid -- how far to support
Moscow's rivalry with the West. D[epending on this decision, we may see
an increase in **China's economic support** for Moscow]{.underline},
[which would be related **first and foremost** **to** Chinese
assessments of **the prospects of their relations with the
West**,]{.underline} [the US in particular]{.underline}. The fact that
the future of the relationship depends so much on China is another
testimony to the asymmetry that has become the key feature of the
relationship.

#### Aggressive security policies by the US push China into a full Russian alliance. 

**Kaczmarski 22** (Marcin Kaczmarski is a lecturer in Security Studies,
School of Social and Political Sciences, University of Glasgow. "The war
in Ukraine and the future of Russia-China relations," 4/28/22,
https://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1683#\_edn0)ZK

Whereas China has supported Russia politically, [the war has put Beijing
in an uncomfortable position with regard to]{.underline} the extent of
possible [material assistance for Russia]{.underline}. At this stage,
the scope of Beijing's possible economic assistance for Russia remains
unknown; so far, [China has avoided any specific
declarations]{.underline} that would suggest readiness to help Russia
bypass Western sanctions. On the one hand, Beijing may be tempted to
capital- ise on Russia's weakness[. Western sanctions have been
gradually depriving Russia of access to partners, cap- ital and advanced
technologies]{.underline}. China might be par- ticularly interested in
gaining stakes in Russian energy companies as well as in the Russian
upstream. Russia's weakness might enable Beijing to entrench its influ-
ence in the Russian energy sector, including the own- ership in Rosneft
or Gazprom as well as in the most promising oil and gas fields. [China
**may** also be unwilling to allow for Russia failure in the war against
Ukraine under the **Western pressure**.]{.underline} This would not only
deprive Beijing of a vi- able partner, leaving China on its own with the
em- powered US/West. It would also weaken the position of Xi Jinping,
due to his personal investment in the relationship with Vladimir Putin.
On the other hand, [support for Russia would gener- ate a number of
risks for Beijing]{.underline}. Economic assistance for Russia,
especially its energy sector, will be difficult to hide from Western
scrutiny, which, in turn, would make Chinese companies subject to
secondary sanc- tions. China is much more exposed to the world and
globalisation process than Russia. The Chinese econ- omy still relies on
the openness of the global econ- omy. Moreover, China's tangible support
for Russia may bring the US and European states closer together and
strengthen trans-Atlantic unity, a result Beijing has been trying to
avoid for the last two decades. **[A factor that may be decisive in
shaping Beijing's choices is the long-term assessment of China's re-
lations with the US]{.underline}**. In case Chinese leaders, and Xi
Jinping in particular, recognise the possibil- ity and the value of a
"strategic pause" in the Sino-American rivalry, [they may favour keeping
a certain distance from Russi]{.underline}a. While we can expect China
to support Russia polit- ically, [in this scenario Beijing would refrain
from assisting Moscow in bypassing Western sanctions.]{.underline}
However, [if Chinese leaders do not see the prospects for a
Sino-American "truce", they will be tempted to strength- en Russia as
being in]{.underline} the avant-garde of a [prolonged
conflict]{.underline} with the US. From this perspective, a durable (in
the foreseeable future and at least throughout Pu- tin's presidency)
Russian-Western antagonism would offer clear strategic benefits to
China, worth risking some deterioration in relations with the US and Eu-
ropean states. Finally, the possibility of domestic change in Rus- sia
induced by the war remains a risk for China. So far, the war and the
sanctions have not generated a decline of Putin's power, but such
developments re- main plausible. The implications of both the change in
the Kremlin and a broader domestic change in Rus- sia would be
far-reaching for Sino-Russian relations. Regardless of whether politics
in a post-Putin Russia would embark on a democratisation path or contin-
ue along authoritarian lines, a new leader will gain an opportunity to
reassess Russia's relations with China. While the sceptical voices have
been largely silenced for the last decade, the dissatisfaction with the
role of a "junior partner" and fear of Chinese nationalism re- main
present in the Russian elite.4

intent on pursuing hybrid tactics that **disrupt democratic

already worrisome for the United States and Europe. [But a scenario in

Likewise, Beijing could use the economic leverage it has accrued to

## Uniqueness

### China AI Now

#### China is leading in AI regulation but it's close---EU is on their heels with new tech legislation

**Keane '22** (Jonathan Keane is a contributor at CNBC, \"China and
Europe are leading the push to regulate A.I.---one of them could set the
global playbook,"
<https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/26/china-and-europe-are-leading-the-push-to-regulate-ai.html>

As China and Europe try to rein in artificial intelligence, [a new front
is opening up around who will set the standards for the burgeoning
technology]{.underline}. In March, China rolled out regulations
governing the way online recommendations are generated through
algorithms, suggesting what to buy, watch or read. It is the latest
salvo in [China's tightening grip on the tech sector]{.underline}, and
[lays down an important marker in the way that AI is
regulated]{.underline}. "For some people it was a surprise that last
year, China started drafting the AI regulation. It's one of the first
major economies to put it on the regulatory agenda," Xiaomeng Lu,
director of Eurasia Group's geo-technology practice, told CNBC. [While
China revamps its rulebook]{.underline} for tech, [the European Union is
thrashing out its own regulatory framework]{.underline} to rein in AI,
but it has yet to pass the finish line. With two of the world's largest
economies presenting AI regulations, the field for AI development and
business globally could be about to undergo a significant change. [At
the core of China's latest policy is online recommendation systems.
Companies must inform users if an algorithm is being used to display
certain information to them, and people can choose to opt out of being
targeted.]{.underline} Lu said that this is an important shift as it
grants people a greater say over the digital services they use. Those
rules come amid a changing environment in China for their biggest
internet companies. Several of China's homegrown tech giants ---
including Tencent, Alibaba and ByteDance --- have found themselves in
hot water with authorities, namely around antitrust. "I think those
trends shifted the government attitude on this quite a bit, to the
extent that they start looking at other questionable market practices
and algorithms promoting services and products," Lu said. China's moves
are noteworthy, given how quickly they were implemented, compared with
the timeframes that other jurisdictions typically work with when it
comes to regulation. China's approach could provide a playbook that
influences other laws internationally, said Matt Sheehan, a fellow at
the Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "I
see [China's]{.underline} AI regulations and the fact that they're
[moving first]{.underline} as essentially running some large-scale
experiments that the rest of the world can watch and potentially learn
something from," he said[. The European Union is also hammering out its
own rules]{.underline}. [The AI Act is the next major piece of tech
legislation on the agenda in what has been a busy few
years]{.underline}. In recent weeks, it closed negotiations on the
Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, two major regulations
that will curtail Big Tech. The AI law now seeks to impose an
all-encompassing framework based on the level of risk, which will have
far-reaching effects on what products a company brings to market. It
defines four categories of risk in AI: minimal, limited, high and
unacceptable. France, which holds the rotating EU Council presidency,
has floated new powers for national authorities to audit AI products
before they hit the market. Defining these risks and categories has
proven fraught at times, with members of the European Parliament calling
for a ban on facial recognition in public places to restrict its use by
law enforcement. However, the European Commission wants to ensure it can
be used in investigations while privacy activists fear it will increase
surveillance and erode privacy. Sheehan said that although the political
system and motivations of [China will be "totally anathema"]{.underline}
to lawmakers in Europe, the technical objectives of both sides bear many
similarities --- and [the West should pay attention to how China
implements them.]{.underline} "We don't want to mimic any of the
ideological or speech controls that are deployed in China, but some of
these problems on a more technical side are similar in different
jurisdictions. And I think that the rest of the world should be watching
what happens out of China from a technical perspective." [China's
efforts are more prescriptive, he said, and they include algorithm
recommendation rules that could rein in the influence of tech companies
on public opinion. The AI Act, on the other hand, is a broad-brush
effort that seeks to bring all of AI under one regulatory
roof.]{.underline} Lu said the European approach will be "more onerous"
on companies as it will require premarket assessment. "That's a very
restrictive system versus the Chinese version, they are basically
testing products and services on the market, not doing that before those
products or services are being introduced to consumers."

#### China will overtake the US in tech leadership -- current cyber developments put China as the frontrunner in AI

Research and development (R&D) statistics illustrate this ambition.
Supported by higher economic growth, [China is actually expected to take
global R&D leadership this year, and outspend the US for the very first
time]{.underline}.1 [China now leads the pack in many areas, such as
artificial intelligence (AI), 5G telecommunication networks, ultra-high
voltage electricity networks or high-speed rail]{.underline}. While
China's technology push is hardly news, rising tensions with the West,
in particular with the US, have put it under the spotlight While China's
technology push is hardly news, rising tensions with the West, in
particular with the US, have put it under the spotlight. Over the past
few years, [Chinese officials have increased their emphasis on the need
to become less dependent on foreign technology]{.underline}. Some have
even theorized a so-called 'technology decoupling', advocating
self-sufficiency in a number of critical industries. However, one key
consideration to bear in mind is that China's technology push amid
rising tensions with the US does not necessarily herald a full economic
decoupling, nor an era of deglobalization, as some have argued.2 For
now, US restrictions on exports to China issued in 2020 remain
essentially focused on a few select technologies, where non-US
alternatives are difficult to find. Meanwhile, [China\'s main policy
goal remains to improve the country's manufacturing capability to
produce higher value-added goods and services, and keep the economic
growth engine roaring]{.underline}. Policy makers acknowledge that this
will be impossible without importing advanced technologies from the US,
Europe, Japan, or South Korea. Figure 1: MIC 2025's ten strategic
industries Source: China State Council, MERICS, Robeco, September 2021.
China's technology ambitions were formally articulated in 2015 with the
'Made in China 2025' (MIC 2025) initiative, a ten-year comprehensive
blueprint aiming to modernize further the country's industrial base. MIC
2025 identifies ten strategic sectors, including aerospace equipment,
medical devices, or high-tech ships, in which China intends to excel and
secure a leading position. Focus on a few selected technologies Even
under the MIC 2025 umbrella, the designated ten core industries are
clearly not all being pursued with the same intensity. In recent years,
China has been prioritizing efforts in a small number of emerging
technologies, including AI, semiconductors, robotics, and new energy
vehicles (NEVs), 3 with colossal efforts being deployed from a human and
a financial perspective. Figure 2: Top 20 countries in AI paper output
1997-2017 Source: China Institute for Science and Technology Policy,
July 2018, "China AI Development Report 2018", Tsinghua University. AI,
for instance, is perhaps the area in which China has achieved the most
spectacular results and secured a clear leading position at global
level.4 The Chinese AI-related ecosystem benefits from various
supporting factors, including the country's gigantic market size which
provided a unique opportunity to assemble large datasets, and a
long-standing friendly policy environment. [AI is perhaps the area in
which China has achieved the most spectacular results and secured a
clear leading position at global level China seems therefore poised to
become a leader in AI-empowered businesses, like speech and image
recognition applications]{.underline}. At global level, the main AI
services providers remain large US technology giants, but Chinese firms
are catching up fast. [China already employs the world's largest cohort,
by far, of AI professionals, with over 12,000 AI jobs in 2019, versus
roughly 7,500 for the US]{.underline}.5 Another area where strong
progress has been made NEVs. [China has the world's largest fleet of
NEVs in circulation, far ahead of Europe and the US, as well as the
world's largest battery-charging network]{.underline}. And although the
country's NEV car registrations were overtaken by European ones last
year, it remains one of the most dynamic markets, largely dominated by
local manufacturers. Figure 3: Market share of top five battery makers
Source: SNE Research, March 2021[. China has also managed to secure a
leading position in various areas of the NEV supply chain.]{.underline}
This is especially the case for electric battery production, where the
largest Chinese manufacturers have emerged as global leaders along with
their South Korean and Japanese competitors. Altogether, [China accounts
for over 70% of global battery cell production capacity]{.underline}. 6
Three investment themes China's technology push is offering
opportunities in many industries, but finding these is not always
straightforward. Not all initiatives have lived up to expectations, so
far, and political will does not warrant success. Yet that does not mean
opportunities in areas where results have been mixed are entirely
absent, nor that policy success will necessarily lead to attractive
returns for investors. From this perspective, we have identified three
major investment themes worth considering: the relentless rise of NEVs,
the advent of 'industry 4.0' in [China, and an increased focus on the
localization of supply chains. Given the bright prospects these three
trends offer, we believe this is where some of the most interesting
opportunities are to be found.]{.underline}

### Cooperation Now

#### **China and the US will collaborate on AI research even through strategic tensions**

**Andrews 3/16** (Edmund L. Andrews is a former economics reporter for
The New York Times who served as a technology reporter in Washington,
European economics correspondent and Washington economics correspondent,
"China and the United States: Unlikely Partners in AI," Stanford
University Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, 3/16/2022,
<https://hai.stanford.edu/news/china-and-united-states-unlikely-partners-ai>)
-- MP

Despite both rivalry and rising tensions between [the United States and
China]{.underline}, the two nations [have become the world's leading
collaborators in research on artificial intelligence]{.underline}. The
newly released AI Index Report, which tracks AI trends on a host of
fronts and is published by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered
Artificial Intelligence, finds that [U.S. and Chinese AI researchers
teamed up on far more published articles than collaborators between any
other two nations]{.underline}. Overall, U.S.-China collaborations on AI
research have quintupled since 2010 and totaled 9,660 papers in
2021---much faster than the increase in collaborations between any other
two nations. Collaborations between the United States and United
Kingdom, the second most prolific source of cross-border research,
increased almost threefold to 3,560 papers. Read the 2022 AI Index The
startling trend highlights a paradox. [Even as China and the U.S. race
for leadership in what they view as a strategically important
technology, researchers on both sides appear to see benefits in sharing
expertise and working together]{.underline}. "What's clear is that the
amount of [collaboration between the United States and China has gone up
dramatically, and it has gone up much more than collaborations between
any two other countries]{.underline}," says Raymond Perrault,
Distinguished Computer Scientist at SRI International in Menlo Park and
co-chair of the AI Index Steering Committee. To some extent, the surge
[in U.S.-China research simply reflects the fact that both nations have
poured vast resources into artificial intelligence and produce huge
amounts of research]{.underline}. On top of that, many Chinese
researchers were trained in the United States and retain close
professional ties to their American colleagues. But the practice is
consistent with patterns observed during previous technological
revolutions in textiles, steel, and chemical engineering. Research by
Jeffrey Ding, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford HAI, has shown that [the
full economic impact of historic tech advances stemmed less from which
nation pioneered a technology than from which ones were best at applying
it across a broad range of industries]{.underline}. That dispersion of
technology requires sharing information across industries as well as
borders, much as the United States catapulted applied British advances
in steel machinery to develop manufacturing approaches that catapulted
it to economic dominance. That said, [the collaboration in AI comes at a
time of growing friction between the United States and China over trade,
human rights, and strategic power in the Pacific Rim]{.underline}.
Former President Donald Trump villainized China over its trade
practices, and President Joe Biden imposed a diplomatic boycott of the
Beijing Olympics over China\'s human rights abuses. Indeed, the volume
of published U.S.-China collaborations in AI has declined slightly from
its peak in 2019. Perrault says it's unclear whether the recent dip
reflects a lag in data, a temporary disruption, or a more fundamental
change. Collaborations have also declined slightly between most other
nations, such as those between researchers in the United States, Canada,
and Europe. Globally, AI research has soared over the past decade. The
volume of peer-reviewed AI journal articles has more than doubled since
2015, hitting a new record of 172,000 papers in 2021. On top of that,
researchers posted 56,000 pre-print articles in repositories
specializing in AI. Chinese researchers have been the most prolific for
the past several years, publishing 27.5% of all AI journal articles
worldwide. American researchers accounted for 12%. Chinese journal
articles also led those of every other nation in citations, an indicator
of their scientific importance. [And although the United States
continues to receive more AI patents than any other nation, China is now
filing more than half of all the world's patent applications in the
field]{.underline}. Image Graph showing increase in patent filings in
China (51.69% of total) while patent filings in the U.S. fall (16.92%)
AI research has also intensified in most other parts of the world,
notably in the European Union, Canada, and Japan. The one notable
exception is Russia, which has largely gone its own way. "Russia is way,
way smaller in this area,'' says Perrault. In the United States, 1,200
institutions published roughly 3,000 cross-border AI collaborations in
2021. In China, 500 institutions published 2,000 cross-border projects.
By contrast only 60 Russian institutions teamed up on 600 AI projects.

### AT: NATO Rhetoric

#### The 'no limits' rhetoric is just posturing, Russian Chinese relations still have holes

**Huang 22** (Eustance Huang is a reporter based out of CNBC's Singapore
office. "Take China and Russia's 'no limits' relationship with a 'grain
of salt,' says former PBOC advisor," 3-31-22,
https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/31/take-china-russia-no-limit-relationship-with-grain-of-salt-li-daokui.html)

[China and Russia's so-called "no limits" partnership is
"**situational**" and should be taken "with a grain of salt," according
to Li Daokui]{.underline}, former advisor to the country's central bank,
known as the People's Bank of China. [Before]{.underline} Russia invaded
Ukraine in late February, [Beijing and Moscow announced a "no
limits"]{.underline} strategic [partnership]{.underline} they said was
meant to counter U.S. influence. In a joint statement, both countries
said there were no "forbidden areas" of cooperation, [but they did not
mention Ukraine even though Russian troops were building up on the
Ukrainian border at that time.]{.underline} "I choose to believe that
**[China will not support Russia in a military way,"]{.underline}** Li,
currently Mansfield Freeman professor of economics at Tsinghua
University, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Wednesday. "\[The\] no
limit relationship should be read with a grain of salt." "However, China
will keep on doing business with Russia based on humanitarian
principles. That is, to help Russian residents to tough through this
very difficult period of time," he said. Since Russia's invasion of
Ukraine on Feb. 24, [Beijing's official stance has been to blame the
conflict on NATO's eastward expansion]{.underline}. Chinese authorities
have so far refused to fully condemn Moscow's invasion of its neighbor.
It stands in sharp contrast to much of the developed world, where
multiple countries have slapped unprecedented sanctions against Russian
businesses, banks and individuals that left Moscow with serious
consequences for its unprovoked invasion. The Russian economy is
expected to fall into a deep recession this year, with the Institute of
International Finance predicting a contraction of up to 15% as a result
of the war. Li predicted that Beijing, in the meantime, will be "very
proactive" in pushing for both Russia and Ukraine to "come to a speedy
agreement." "Let's keep in mind: both Russia and Ukraine before this
conflict have been good friends with China," he said. "People tend to
forget --- Ukraine is actually wonderful, wonderful friend of China
also, besides Russia."

### AT: New Strategic Concept

#### Historical context outweighs recent statements -- Strong rhetoric, doesn't translate to policies -- the DA is still unique because plan changes the 'low-key' approach to recalibrate substantial resources and security policies to China -- that causes NATO in-fighting and forces confrontation with China.

[Having addressed four categories of possible actions [the
Alliance]{.mark} may take with respect to China, it is now essential to
address the degree to which a consensus on these actions exists among
member states. The USA has clearly taken the strongest hard-line stance
on China]{.underline}. During the Trump administration, Washington
viewed its continued support for NATO at least in part on the extent to
which the rest of the Alliance accepted the US characterization of China
as a strategic competitor. Essentially [this [amounted to NATO adopting
critical **rhetoric** about China]{.mark} in support of the American
position, **[but not making any major changes to
its]{.mark}**]{.underline} diplomacy or **[[military
posture]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Since his inauguration, President [Biden
has continued to emphasize the security threat]{.underline} posed [by
China]{.underline}, though typically framing it in the broader context
of authoritarian governments versus democracies. [The United Kingdom has
closely echoed the American rhetoric about China]{.underline} and is
considering adapting its military posture to maintain some presence in
Asia (Fisher, 2020; Patalano, 2019). [[A]{.mark} second [group
of]{.mark} member [states]{.mark},]{.underline} particularly in Eastern
Europe, [[are happy to **pay lip service** to American]{.mark} policy
[preferences **so long as the USA does not detract too much attention
and resources**]{.mark} away from defense against threats in its
immediate neighbourhood.]{.underline} [[A third group]{.mark} consists
of member]{.underline} states that wish to maintain Alliance cohesion
but [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[unwilling to oppose China in any
significant way]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially not with a public
condemnation, largely due to fear of economic retaliation. Both of the
latter two groups of NATO members are more or less united in their
opposition to the Alliance taking anything other than superficial
actions against China. [[This **low-key approach**]{.mark} has also been
replicated,]{.underline} to some degree, in the formation of EU policy
towards China (Brady, 2020; Peel, 2020). Of note has been the lack of a
pro-China faction seeking to prevent NATO in the first instance from
portraying China as a security problem. [China [is]{.mark} now
[established]{.mark} on the NATO agenda]{.underline} and is set to
become further enshrined in the forthcoming Strategic Concept. Looking
ahead, [policy positions within the Alliance will reflect a **difference
in degree** rather than a difference in kind.]{.underline}
[**Conclusion** [Though the NATO 2030 report labelled China
']{.mark}a]{.underline} very different kind [of [challenge', it does not
represent a *new* challenge for NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. Understanding
the evolution of NATO's approach to China provides important clues about
the future relationship. For example, without any historical knowledge,
the prospect of China posing a direct threat to the NATO area, including
a nuclear threat, as discussed by some present-day officials and
commentators, as well as in the 2021 communiqué, might seem an ominous
prospect. Yet [[when placed]{.mark} in the **[context]{.mark}** of NATO
officials in the mid-1960s making similar claims, [the prospect becomes
less menacing]{.mark}.]{.underline} [That **[the Alliance has been
reluctant]{.mark}** to engage militarily in the Asia-Pacific, despite
American requests]{.underline} to do so, [also has a long lineage, and
there are few indications that the reasons for this long-standing
reluctance have altered in any fundamental way]{.underline},
particularly given the omnipresent threat posed by Russia. On the other
hand, prospects for meaningful cooperation with China lack precedent.
During the heyday of good relations in the 1980s or in the post-9/11
decade, neither side seemed interested in establishing more meaningful
ties, despite many common interests. Thus, the historical record of NATO
policy towards China offers many insights regarding the spectrum of
positive and negative relations. As the Alliance crafts its eighth
Strategic Concept, there is little doubt the degree to which China
features in the document, beyond what has already been agreed in earlier
policy statements, will provoke intense internal debate. [**[Based on
historical precedent]{.underline}**, [the NATO debate will almost
certainly be inconclusive given the diversity of
views]{.underline}]{.mark} about acceptable and unacceptable actions.
[[Whereas the **US**]{.mark}**A [might prefer that NATO replicate
its]{.mark} own set of [security priorities]{.mark},**]{.underline}
[essentially by recognizing that China constitutes a]{.underline} more
important long-term [challenge]{.underline} than Russia**[, [this is not
a realistic prospect]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[It is more likely the
Alliance wil]{.mark}l continue [adhering to the US **rhetoric** on
China]{.mark}]{.underline} as a long-term strategic competitor [[but
will **avoid any substantive change in policy**]{.mark}.]{.underline} It
will also avoid making any major institutional transformation to become
an active player in the Asia-Pacific, [[preferring instead to
re-emphasize **defensive** measures closer to home]{.mark} which will
have the added utility of strengthening NATO's defenses [vis-**a-vis

### Econ Uniqueness

Avoid a Global Recession,\" No Publication,

\--sri

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: President Biden recently made an obscure statement
with big implications. It was a statement about the United States and
its great rival, China. In a Wall Street Journal article, the president
wrote, [the U.S. economy may grow faster this year than China's economy
for the first time since 1976]{.underline}. That would be news if it
happened. The U.S. has the world's largest economy, but China, with its
giant population, has drawn closer year by year. So could the U.S.
reverse that trend and pull farther ahead? ARTHUR KROEBER: It's
possible. I wouldn't say that it's terribly likely. INSKEEP: China
specialist Arthur Kroeber gives that assessment. He nonetheless says
China faces a lot of uncertainty about its growth, now and in the
future. Since money can translate into global power, a lot is at stake.
So we talked through [China's economic problems]{.underline}. [Problems
this spring included massive COVID lockdowns in the economic center of
Shanghai.]{.underline} KROEBER: I think, base case, we're looking at
[another 12 months, at least, of China being pretty strict in its COVID
control and, you know, accepting some economic damage as a result of
that.]{.underline} INSKEEP: As an authoritarian system, are there parts
of the government that are kind of comfortable shutting down the country
and keeping the borders fairly closed? KROEBER: Oh, for sure. I mean, I
think the Communist Party has a strong interest in control and
surveillance. And then if you look at the border controls, I think for a
lot of countries, reopening the borders has been very important because
they want to promote travel and, you know, all kinds of economic
activity that depends on face-to-face interaction. Chinese government
has been, you know, pretty accepting of the idea that we closed the
borders. We don't have too many people coming in. That's fine. We do our
thing. We make our stuff in our factories and send it to the rest of the
world. We don't actually need open borders to run the kind of economy
that we want. INSKEEP: What other factors might be dragging down the
Chinese economy? KROEBER: Well, so the government [initiated a pretty
big crackdown on the big internet platform companies - companies like
Alibaba and Tencent]{.underline} - that, like the big internet companies
in the U.S., reap enormous profits by scooping up lots of consumer data
and, you know, doing things that are, you know, maybe questionable from
a market power or a privacy standpoint. And some people have said, well,
this - [also, because these companies are privately owned, this is kind
of a signal that the government is more hostile to private
enterprise]{.underline}. I think that's somewhat debatable, but that's
clearly a risk. [The other big thing that is a major problem long-term
for them is the property sector. They've derived a lot of their growth
over the last 20 years basically from the biggest property boom in
history. And it's now clear that the sort of underlying rate of demand
for housing in urban areas has peaked. So this major source of growth is
evaporating.]{.underline} INSKEEP: Does the war in Ukraine affect
China's economy? KROEBER: The main impact is that [China derives a lot
of its growth still from exports. The major markets for their exports
are Europe and the U.S. Europe, in particular, is looking like it's
going to have, you know, very weak growth, maybe even a recession this
year. U.S. is maybe not looking so hot. That's going to hurt the Chinese
export sector, and that's going to bring their growth down a
bit.]{.underline} INSKEEP: Does China get some benefit from allying
itself with Russia, which has very few other allies in the world?
KROEBER: Yeah, well, that's a great question. And I think beneath the
surface in China, there's a lot of debate about that. I think there are
plenty of people within the Chinese system who are quite unhappy with
the decision to place all the national chips in the Russia corner. But I
think if you look at this from the standpoint of Xi Jinping, why did he
do this? I think there's a judgment that, No. 1, the U.S. is now
implacably hostile towards China, wants to contain China, wants to
constrain its growth and so they need friends wherever they can get
them. INSKEEP: Let's test Xi's assumption that you mentioned there. Is
the United States actively trying to constrain China's growth, and are
they able to do anything that would actually accomplish that? KROEBER:
Well, Secretary Blinken said no, the U.S. is not trying to constrain
Chinese growth. I think, though, if you look at actual [U.S.
policies]{.underline}, which are all about constraining flows of trade,
technology and finance to China, it would be reasonable for people in
China to look at this and say, well, you're saying one thing, but
actually, your actions show that you're [interested in slowing China's
rate of growth and constraining our ability to rise in economic
power.]{.underline} INSKEEP: Can the U.S. do that? KROEBER: I think the
short answer is no. China is now the leading trade partner for a
majority of the world's countries. They're trying to substitute stuff
that they import with domestic products. So China can, I think, take
itself out of the global economy, but I think it [will be very difficult
for the U.S. to do that]{.underline}. INSKEEP: So let me circle back to
the statement with which we began, the statement by President Biden
about the U.S. outstripping China, maybe for a year. We have lived for
many years with the idea that China's economy, at some point, maybe not
too far in the future, will be larger than the United States, that the
U.S. will no longer be the world's largest economy, which would have
huge implications. Maybe there's another scenario where China turns out
like Japan in the '80s, where it was thought they were going to surpass
the United States, but they stagnated and their population started
shrinking and just - things turned out differently. [Is it possible that
China does not overtake the United States as the world's largest economy
any time soon? KROEBER: Yeah, I think it's definitely possible. I would
basically rate the odds as about a coin flip. They're pouring huge
amounts of government resources to build up their semiconductor
industries, other high-tech industries. And their theory is that if they
build up these high-tech industries, this will generate a lot of
productivity growth. You know, and if that succeeds and they're right,
then China would overtake the U.S. as the world's biggest economy
sometime early in the 2030s]{.underline}. And then there would be a
question of how long they could sustain that lead, given that they're in
long-term demographic decline, whereas the U.S. is probably going to
keep adding population. But then the [other possibility is that they're
wrong]{.underline}, that they can't generate enough productivity from
this technology investment, that they need more sort of market-oriented
reforms to deregulate and create more consumer-driven demand. And that
if they don't do that, then they'll stagnate, which I think, in China's
case, means that they'll start growing more like 2 to 3% - so maybe
slightly more than the U.S., but not that much. And then you can easily
construct a scenario under which they never catch up with U.S. INSKEEP:
Arthur Kroeber, author of "China's Economy: What Everyone Needs To
Know," thanks so much. KROEBER: My pleasure.

#### China econ recovering -- 

While most economies are falling, China's seem to be on the long path to
recovery post omicron shutdowns, expected to peak higher than after
first COVID recession, but at a slower rate

[Despite being only halfway through the year, 2022 already seems set to
be a remarkable one. Inflation in many developed-market economies is at
multi-decade highs,]{.underline} while the S&P 500 had the worst start
to the year in half a century. [Amid the volatile market environment,
the resilience of Chinese equities is notable. China's benchmark CSI 300
Index has rallied about 10 per cent in the past month. It is one of the
few major equity markets to have recorded a positive return in that
period, outperforming both developed- and emerging-market equities.
Chinese equities look better positioned in the current global macro
environment, given more favourable growth and policy cycles than the
rest of the world. The core problem across developed economies is
elevated inflation rates.]{.underline} In the United States, for
example, core consumer price inflation was running at 6 per cent year on
year in May, well above the US Federal Reserve's target of 2 per cent.
Euro-zone inflation has also accelerated in recent months. Central banks
are tightening monetary policy in the face of these pressures. To
successfully contain inflation, they must cool aggregate demand, which
means a slower pace of growth. As a result, caution is warranted on the
outlook for developed economies as they are likely to experience a
period of sluggish growth. [In contrast, inflation is not a prevailing
issue in China as core inflation remains below 1 per cent. As such, it
is unlikely to constrain further policy easing. China's economic growth
is likely to recover in the second half of 2022, helped by strong policy
support and the fading impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.]{.underline}
Policy easing has been ramped up on the monetary, fiscal and property
fronts in recent months. There have also been positive developments on
technology regulation, including the issuance of a second batch of
gaming licences, which suggests we may be past the peak of regulatory
tightening. While the magnitude of policy easing introduced so far is
modest compared with in the past, the frequency of recent announcements
suggests policymakers are increasingly concerned about the risks to
growth. Fiscal policy is likely to be the key focus in the near term.
[Beijing has long turned to fiscal support for infrastructure investment
as an important lever to stabilise the economy. The strength and pace of
infrastructure stimulus will be central for China's growth recovery in
the coming months.]{.underline} Fiscal funding is important to monitor
the progress of infrastructure stimulus. So far, weaker-than-expected
fiscal revenue and land sales because of the pandemic and ongoing
property downturn are weighing on funding for infrastructure investment
from the state budget. So we should expect policymakers to lean more on
the government-run policy banks to fill the funding gap. Premier Li
Keqiang recently announced an 800 billion yuan (US\$119.4 billion)
additional quota for policy bank lending specifically designated for
infrastructure investment. [As Covid-19 restrictions have eased amid
falling case counts, the Chinese economy has taken the first steps
towards recovery. Stronger-than-expected May activity suggests growth
momentum bottomed out in April as the country moved past the worst of
the pandemic-induced economic drag. China's recovery is likely to be led
by a resumption of production and supply chain normalisation, followed
by a recovery in consumption demand]{.underline}. This would be
consistent with the experience of Shenzhen, one of the first major
cities in China to reopen after an Omicron-driven lockdown in March.
Shenzhen's "slow life" Covid-19 fight an evolving pandemic strategy from
mainland China? High-frequency indicators show that intracity traffic
and truck flows recovered in around two weeks to pre-lockdown levels as
the city reopened. However, lingering Covid-19 restrictions have made it
more challenging for service-sector consumption -- such as in-restaurant
dining and going to cinemas -- to recover. Overall, [we should expect a
more gradual recovery in the second half of the year, compared with the
V-shaped recovery in spring 2020]{.underline}. The unsynchronised
lockdowns across major cities are likely to lead to a staggered
reopening process, limiting the speed of the rebound. [Moreover, China
is unlikely to enjoy the same tailwind from global goods demand and a
buoyant domestic property sector that it did in 2020. Uncertainties
about the virus and the "zero-Covid" policy are also likely to weigh on
sentiment.]{.underline} While slowing global growth will constrain the
extent of China's rebound, the expected recovery is a distinctly
different path from weakening growth elsewhere. The divergence in policy
and growth cycles between China and the rest of the world is likely to
underpin Chinese equities' continued outperformance, relatively
speaking, in the coming months.

#### China econ on the brink. 

Jane **Li et al**, 10-15-**2021**, (Jane Li is a reporter covering
China\'s economy and social trends \"China is the engine for global
economic growth. What happens if it slows down?,\" Quartz,
<https://qz.com/2072618/could-chinas-economy-collapse/>) \--sri

For almost half a century, Chinese officials have overseen one of the
greatest economic transformations in human history. The country has gone
from collectivized farms and famine to world-leading tech companies and
gleaming megacities connected by superfast trains. More than 800 million
Chinese have been pulled out of poverty as the Communist Party and its
leader Xi Jinping string together (according to the party's numbers)
decades of uninterrupted growth. But [the economy is now at another
turning point]{.underline}. [In an effort to control what it sees as the
excesses of the market, and to limit companies' power and influence, the
party has deliberately swept the legs out from under giants like
e-commerce titan Alibaba and ride-hailing upstart Didi, wiping out
billions of dollars of market value from China's most dynamic
enterprises. Evergrande, the massive property developer on the brink of
collapse, shows that China's real-estate boom could be unraveling, with
the possibility of sickening the entire economy]{.underline}. (On Oct.
13, after Evegrande missed yet another scheduled coupon payment,
borrowing costs for China's riskier firms soared to record highs.) If
that wasn't enough, [president Xi Jinping also has to manage an
electricity crunch---triggered partly by his own aims to cut carbon
emissions---that could wear down manufacturing and
industry.]{.underline} These problems come at a sensitive time, for both
China and the world. At the party congress next year, Xi may look to
secure an unprecedented third term in office, after he abolished the
term limits on the presidency in 2018. [The party depends on muscular
economic growth to retain its perennial grip on power. "This was the
Faustian bargain, never really explicitly stated but understood, that
you get zero political representation but we keep the economy ticking
along]{.underline}," said Fraser Howie, co-author of Red Capitalism: The
Fragile Financial Foundation of China's Extraordinary Rise and a former
equity-derivatives trader at Morgan Stanley. But, Howie said, clearly
that bargain is "starting to fray around the edges." [Symptoms of an
imbalance in the economy include widening inequality, a dangerous
dependence on real-estate, climate-change risks, and high levels of both
corporate and consumer debt. The government's reforms aim to make life
better for rank-and-file workers and their families, and maintain power,
but they could also derail the economy as market forces are replaced
with even more party control.]{.underline} Elsewhere too, [a
slowing-down of the Chinese economic engine---at a time when the world
is struggling to recover from the pandemic---presents an alarming
prospect for investors and policymakers]{.underline}. The question is
unavoidable: What would a contracting Chinese economy mean, for both
China and the world? How one building block of China's economy broke
down It's hard to overstate how important real estate has become to
Chinese growth, and it's a story that goes back three decades. Soon
after the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, the Chinese government
instituted a series of economic reforms. One of them was to "put all the
responsibility for social services on local governments and yet give
them none of the financing," said Anne Stevenson-Yang, the co-founder of
J Capital Research, which publishes reports on Chinese listed companies.
A crying student walks towards her family member after the annual
national college entrance exam in The solution that the local
governments came up with, Stevenson-Yang said, was to monetize land.
They'd borrow money to buy up small adjoining patches of farmland or
housing, then sell the aggregate to a real estate developer. Everyone
seemed happy, Stevenson-Yang said: "The government got taxes from all
the cement plants and steel mills and construction companies. The local
governments could keep borrowing and selling. The people who lived on
these small plots of land could move into the high-rise complexes that
were built there. No one had an incentive for this cycle to decline."
For the government, [real estate offered an easy way to fend off worries
of flagging growth]{.underline}---perhaps too easy. Housing in large
Chinese cities is among the most expensive in the world when measured as
a share of income. Property, including construction and related
industries, now accounts for roughly a third of the country's gross
domestic product, according to now widely cited estimates by Kenneth
Rogoff of Harvard University and Yuanchen Yang of Tsinghua University.
Some have likened the boom in Chinese real estate to those in the US and
Japan in earlier decades; house prices in China's tier-one cities have
soared sixfold since 2002, compared with an 80% increase in US home
prices between 2000 and 2005 during the subprime bubble. What Evergrande
is telling us now is that the market is cresting. But as property
developers began to incur extraordinary levels of debt, the state
recognized the need to deleverage the sector before the bubble burst to
catastrophic effect. Last year, new regulations, known as the Three Red
Lines, forced developers to tighten up their financing arrangements. One
way to read Evergrande's struggles is as a giant correction that the
government actually wanted: a shake-out of a highly indebted sector, set
off by the government's reforms. "What Evergrande is telling us now is
that the market is cresting," said George Magnus, the former chief
economist at Swiss bank UBS. Another way is to see it as a side-effect
of China slamming the brakes, slowing down one of the hottest generators
of its growth story. Rogoff and Yang argue that a 20% drop in
real-estate activity, even without a banking crisis, could take as much
as 10% out of the country's GDP. Experts like Howie say there are few
signs of a replacement for the property sector, the rocket-fuel that has
been powering China over the past two decades. As Evergrande's missed
bond payments pile up, [economists says China will have to find a new
engine for growth, such as consumption]{.underline}. "This is a tipping
point for Chinese real estate," Magnus said. The threat of China's tech
crackdown As China's government wrestles with its property woes[,
authorities are also fighting on a second front with entrepreneurs, in
an apparent bid to both mitigate the worst effects of market forces and
exert greater control over the private sector.]{.underline} [Beijing has
dismayed its private-education sector by enacting strict new rules,
trying to limit both the expenses incurred by students and the intense
pressures felt by them in a hyper-competitive academic
environment]{.underline}. Shares of New Oriental, the leading tutoring
company, plunged by 70% in Hong Kong, leading the slump of fortunes for
several other education firms. The country's [tech companies, meanwhile,
have scrambled to pledge their profits to charity after the government
cracked down on gaming time for teenagers, launched some of the world's
strictest data laws, gave record fines to Alibaba and its peers on
antitrust grounds, and promised to review companies seeking overseas
listings much more strictly]{.underline}. Shares of Didi have shed more
than half their value since going public in the US in July. In a viral
opinion piece widely republished by state media this year, the columnist
Li Guangman read into these crackdowns a profound revolution. "The
capital market will no longer be a paradise for capitalists to grow rich
overnight," Li wrote. But more broadly still, it's easy to wonder if
Beijing is turning hostile towards private companies and China's
so-called capitalists altogether. That concern is making some of the
world's top investors think twice about Chinese tech firms. Soros Fund
Management said this month that the hedge fund isn't putting money into
China. Cathie Wood, the celebrated stock-picker, told the Financial
Times last month that her firm ARK Invest had slashed its China
holdings. Wood, ordinarily bullish on China, said that she was focusing
only on firms that are clearly "currying favor" with Beijing. "This is a
real risk, that they could impinge on many of the forces that have been
so dynamic in driving the economy in recent years---the private sector,
the internet platform companies, and the entrepreneurial spirit required
to drive these innovative companies," said Stephen Roach, senior
lecturer at Yale's School of Management and the former chairman of
Morgan Stanley Asia. "I say that as someone who has been optimistic on
China for 25 years. I think it's a big issue." Not everyone is giving up
on China Some others, though, are more optimistic. Ray Dalio, for one.
China's leaders "believe that capitalism is a way of increasing the
wealth and power of the country---that's been key---at the same time
that it's important to redistribute \[wealth\]," Dalio, the founder of
the world's biggest hedge fund Bridgewater, said in a recent interview
with CNBC. According to Dalio's research and metrics, the US and China
are still the most capitalist countries. China is "not going back to
what you would call the old communism," he said. Many of the crackdowns
are driven by social goals. Even a slowing economy is unlikely to
significantly dent China's efforts to expand its industries, which are
essential for the economy's long-term success, according to Jacob
Gunter, a senior analyst at the German think tank MERICS. Core sectors,
such as the manufacturing of chemicals or industrial machinery, will
likely be insulated even if growth slows, Gunter said. And Roach says a
key underpinning of the expansion of Chinese real-estate---the migration
of people from farms to cities---is still in place. He estimates that
about 60% of China's population is urban, and that the number will swell
to 75% or 80% in the coming decade. "I don't subscribe to the idea that
this is a US- or Japanese-style bubble," he said. What happens if
China's economic growth slows? What happens, though, if China can't make
the math work---if the country can't crank out world-leading growth
while handicapping its innovative tech businesses, coping with
electricity deficits, and powering down debt and real-estate as the
engines of growth? At what point does discontent turn into social
unrest? Much will depend on just how much the economy slows, said
Gunter, and also how citizens view the benefits of these crackdowns in
comparison to the costs. "Many of the crackdowns are driven by social
goals---destroying private tutoring means less pressure on families,
pushing better working conditions for delivery workers means better and
safer jobs, real estate restrictions could make home ownership more
feasible for middle-class folks, and cracking down on data abuse means
more choices for consumers regarding their data." [Should growth slow to
worrying levels]{.underline}, to the point that citizens are hit with
steep losses on generational wealth tied up in real estate, [China may
well witness civil unrest]{.underline}. But given the government's
control over information and protest, a more likely outcome of an
economic downshift is [upheaval within the party]{.underline}, said
George Magnus, the former UBS chief economist. Until now, Magnus said,
there has been "little factional rivalry because challengers to Xi
Jinping tend to end up punished or in prison." But that could change
quickly if Xi is seen to be losing control of the economy. "I'm not
really optimistic that this leadership in China, the incumbent
leadership, is going to be able to resolve this kind of contradiction
with big business," he said. A crowd of protesters, one carrying a
placard reading &quot;build more public housing, reform tax
system&quot;, is pushed back by security workers in Hong Kong, China in
2018.REUTERS/BOBBY YIP Slower economic growth could trigger
demonstrations like this one in Hong Kong in 2018. "Build more public
housing, reform tax system" reads the protester's sign. China is so
tightly wrapped into the world economy now that a slowdown will cause
jitters everywhere. Foreign investors held around 3.5% of China's equity
and bond markets as of last year---a small percentage that nonetheless
runs into hundreds of billions of dollars. In turn, China is one of the
world's largest customer for US Treasury securities; if it slows its
purchases of these instruments, the US might have to draw other
customers by raising interest rates, in turn affecting rates across the
US economy. One study showed that a Chinese growth shock would hit
emerging economies in Asia and the rest of the BRICS economies harder
than it would Western countries. China cannot hit the brakes abruptly
without causing a pile-up behind it. Gunter also speculated that an
economic deceleration might turn China further into itself. "Any
slowdown or economic challenge can always be painted as the result of
foreign powers, especially the US, 'containing' China," he said.
"Stirring up nationalism as a pressure valve to domestic troubles is
hardly new, nor is it something that only the Chinese Communist Party
has done."

Russian president Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has put China in
a difficult position. Putin launched his war of aggression just weeks
after meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping and declaring jointly
their "no limits" partnership. China's tacit backing of Russia clashes
with Beijing's stated support for the principles of sovereignty and
territorial integrity and jeopardizes Beijing's relations with Europe.
[Putin's war of choice is compounding China's Covid-19-related economic
challenges, causing energy and food prices to rise, and the remarkable
resilience of Ukraine]{.underline} and strong allied response have
likely prompted China to reexamine its calculus on Taiwan. Some analysts
and policymakers have posited, therefore, [that Russia's war in Ukraine
will arrest the trajectory of deepening Russia-China relations,
**weakening** the countries' partnership]{.underline}. Indeed, there are
data points that support this hypothesis[. Chinese companies and banks
have pulled back from new and ongoing initiatives in the Russian
market]{.underline} to avoid Western sanctions, and [Chinese official

In just a few days, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has upended decades of
international relations thinking and practices. Nothing will be the same
as before. Even the 5,000-word statement on "international relations in
a new era" issued by China and Russia just a month ago in Beijing -- to
make the world safe for autocracy -- has been overtaken by events. In
this ugly Russian quagmire, China's role and behaviour merit close
attention, not least as we wonder whether Ukraine today may be Taiwan
tomorrow. China and Russia have been getting closer for some time. The
binds are visible in bilateral trade, which has more than doubled since
2015 to almost \$150bn. China is Russia's biggest trade partner. While
Russia is almost a rounding error in China's global exports, the two
countries collaborate in military exercises, regional security
arrangements and technology trade. These binds go some way to counter
other differences and long-standing sources of mistrust, for example
over Russian far east and central Asia. Yet, the biggest bind of all is
geopolitics. Ukraine crisis poses dilemma for China but also opportunity
Read more Headed by control-obsessed dictators pledged to remain in
power and protect their elites, they have both been gifted political
opportunities created by, for example, the long tail of the 2008
"western" financial crisis, Brexit and European political weakness,
Donald Trump, and Covid management issues in many democracies. They are
joined at the hip in their pursuit of an anti-US and anti-western agenda
in which they want to reshape the world order, including by force.
Putin's awkward and brutal [invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} doesn't
change any of this but it has [changed the Sino-Russian
relationship]{.underline} consummated at the Olympics on 4 February, and
caused China consternation. Considerable speculation focuses on what Xi
Jinping knew. It is hard to believe Xi was not forewarned about
something, especially as the US tried to brief him with intelligence
only to be rebuffed. We also know Russian troops were subsequently moved
from the far east to Ukraine, and China is thought to have bought back
previously released oil into its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Whatever
the reality, China is deemed to have been complicit, at least by
supporting Russia and backing it since, leaving it uncomfortably on a
spiky fence. Xi won't back away from Putin because to do so would lead
to much embarrassment and humiliation at home -- a non-starter,
especially in this key year ending with the 20th Party Congress[. Yet,
standing by Putin, and supporting overtly the weak Russian economy
associates China firmly with a pariah state and erodes such trust and
credibility in China's statecraft. China's list of friends globally
isn't that big or impressive anyway.]{.underline} With strong leverage
over Russia now, China can help its beleaguered neighbour, which, with
its main banks excluded from the global financial system, its foreign
exchange reserves frozen, and firms and persons subject to sanctions and
asset freezes, has become a vassal state of China. It can buy much more
energy and resources, and subject to ubiquitous sanctions laws, make
loans, provide funds via currency swap agreements, trade in yuan, and
supply semiconductors and other technology goods. Yet, [China will have
to be careful to calibrate an image which isn't overly accommodating,
and reminds the world both that it can be an agent for important public
goods, such as peace-broking in Ukraine, and that it wants the global
system to remain relatively open.]{.underline} Remember that, [**unlike
Russia, China's ambitions depend on a relatively open world economy** in
trade and technology, and on global and regional institutions which it
would like to re-shape to suit its own interests]{.underline}. This is
**[all at risk]{.underline}** now [if democracy-supporting nations
choose to push a Russia-supporting China further away]{.underline} -- or
if China doubles down to insulate itself. [China was certainly shocked
how the EU, in particular, and the US came together purposefully and
forcefully to freeze Russia out of the system]{.underline}. China's
continuing dependency on key western technologies and markets remains,
despite acts of decoupling and self-reliance. [It would certainly **not
want to risk being in the cross-hairs of a Russia-type financial war**
over, for example, Taiwan.]{.underline}

#### China said they are merely strategic partners with Russia, not allies, and are cagey now. 

**Feng**, 2-28-**2022**, (John Feng is a contributing editor at

**\**
[China\'s \"no limits\" partnership with Russia is under
scrutiny]{.underline} [amid]{.underline} Vladimir Putin\'s [invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}, throughout which Beijing\'s noncommittal position
has been interpreted as tacit support for the Russian president\'s
attempts at regime change in Kyiv. China-Russia relations were elevated
to a special category in 2019. The \"comprehensive strategic partnership
of coordination for a new era\" signaled strong military, political and
economic alignment, and close ties described last year as \"better than
an alliance.\" But as Putin\'s military campaign against his neighbors
threatens to make his country a pariah on the international
stage---through banned airspace, canceled visas and unprecedented
economic sanctions---Russia has pointed to China as an example of a
major power still offering friendship and support. At a daily press
conference on Monday, [as the invasion entered its fifth
day]{.underline}, [China\'s foreign ministry tried subtly to put some
distance between Beijing\'s relationship with Moscow and the hostilities
in Ukraine]{.underline}. \"China and Russia are comprehensive strategic
partners of coordination. [China-Russia relations are based on
non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting of third
countries]{.underline},\" ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.
China\'s position on the Ukraine crisis is \"based on the merits of the
matter itself,\" he said, without elaborating. \"We always stand on the
side of peace and justice.\" He then reiterated a description of the
situation as \"complex,\" refusing to back Kyiv outright. [Beijing\'s
implicit support for Ukraine thus far has come in the form of one
oft-repeated phrase: \"The sovereignty and territorial integrity of
every country should be respected and safeguarded. The aims and
principles of the UN Charter should be upheld. This is China\'s
consistent position, and is it a basic norm governing international
relations that all countries should subscribe to.\"]{.underline} \"China
does not approve of solving problems through sanctions,\" Wang said. The
official added that it was likely to cause new problems and a
\"lose-lose\" economic situation for all. Chinese firms would continue
trading with Russia, he suggested. In response to a question about
President Putin putting his country\'s nuclear forces on alert, Wang
took the chance to criticize NATO\'s eastward expansion and said
Moscow\'s \"legitimate security demands should be addressed.\" All sides
should \"remain calm, exercise restraint and avoid further escalation,\"
Wang said. Chinese Citizens in Ukraine China is facing some criticism at
home for failing to pull some 6,000 Chinese citizens out of Ukraine
before Russia\'s full-scale invasion began last Thursday. Despite
Russia\'s troop buildup along the border and non-stop warnings from the
United States, China didn\'t appear to believe Putin would take such
drastic action. Days before the attacks began, Beijing was still
accusing Washington of \"playing up the threat of war.\" Its embassy
remained operational throughout, and it failed to issue a travel
advisory or recommend its citizens find a route home. After Russia\'s
forces advanced into Kyiv-held territory and missile barrages began
hitting military installations, Chinese officials in Ukraine were unable
to arrange evacuation flights and could only ask citizens to stay put.
Before fighting broke out, the Chinese Embassy in Kyiv advised citizens
to remain indoors or affix Chinese flags to their vehicles if traveling
by car. Some 24 hours later, that advice changed to seek shelter and not
to actively reveal one\'s nationality. Chinese state-owned news outlets
reported what were said to be government-led efforts to charter planes
for its citizens. But the embassy later said the conditions were not
suitable for such an evacuation---the airspace had been long closed by
then. Spokesperson Wang said the foreign ministry remained in touch with
the embassy and would arrange evacuations when possible. Asked whether
China had mismanaged the evacuation, Wang said the situation on the
ground underwent \"rapid changes.\" He dismissed reports that said U.S.
officials had tried warning Beijing about the invasion several months in
advance.

[**AI represents a significant opportunity for China to accelerate
productivity growth**, which is a **crucial** concern **as the
population ages**]{.underline}. However, policy makers will also need to
consider and prepare for the potential labor market disruptions it could
unleash. In the past few decades, [China has benefited greatly from a
"demographic dividend]{.underline}," as its expanding labor force fueled
economic growth. [But]{.underline} China [will lose that momentum as its
population ages. The]{.underline} country's **[working-age population
has already peaked]{.underline}** and will continue to shrink in the
decades ahead. This demographic trend implies that [China would **fall
well short of the workforce** needed to sustain economic growth at
current productivity levels]{.underline}. [The **only
alternative**]{.underline} for maintaining momentum [would be to
**sharply accelerate productivity growth**]{.underline}.12 [AI
could]{.underline} partially [close this gap]{.underline}. [AI systems
can improve productivity]{.underline} by completing existing job
activities more efficiently, either by assisting or replacing humans.
Intel, for example, collects mass data alongside its chip manufacturing
process, and the company used to rely on human employees to do
root-cause analysis with the data if an error appeared. But now [machine
learning can complete this task much faster than humans]{.underline};
algorithms can sift through thousands of data points about each chip to
find the common patterns among those with defects. Furthermore, AI can
make industrial machinery, supply chains, logistics routing, and other
processes more efficient. AI applications could create dramatic
efficiencies by predicting failures, identifying bottlenecks, and
automating processes and decisions. [A large share of the Chinese
economy consists of]{.underline} accommodation and food services,
manufacturing, agriculture, and other sectors in which a
disproportionate share of the work consists of [routine tasks that can
be automated]{.underline}. According to an MGI report, [**AI-led
automation** can give the Chinese economy a productivity
injection]{.underline} that would add 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points to
GDP growth annually, depending on the speed of adoption. In addition to
improving productivity, [the rise of AI is also likely to create new
products and services, and hence new occupations and
businesses.]{.underline} Just a few decades ago, no one would have
imagined the many jobs now associated with the Internet economy, and AI
could have a similarly transformative effect.

In the past decade, China has built a solid foundation to support its AI
economy and made significant contributions to AI globally. Stanford
University's AI Index, which assesses AI advancements worldwide across
various metrics in research, development, and economy, ranks China among
the top three countries for global AI vibrancy.1 [On research, for
example, China produced about one-third of both AI journal papers and AI
citations worldwide]{.underline} in 2021. In economic investment, [China
accounted for nearly one-fifth of global private investment funding in
2021, attracting \$17 billion for AI start-ups]{.underline}.2 Today, [AI
adoption is high in China in finance, retail, and high tech, which
together account for more than one-third of the country's AI
market]{.underline} (see sidebar "Five types of AI companies in
China").3 In tech, for example, leaders Alibaba and ByteDance, both
household names in China, have become known for their highly
personalized AI-driven consumer apps. In fact, most of the AI
applications that have been widely adopted in China to date have been in
consumer-facing industries, propelled by the world's largest internet
consumer base and the ability to engage with consumers in new ways to
increase customer loyalty, revenue, and market valuations. So what's
next for AI in China? In the coming decade, our research indicates that
[there is tremendous opportunity for AI growth in new sectors in China,
including some where innovation and R&D spending have traditionally
lagged global counterparts: automotive, transportation, and logistics;
manufacturing; enterprise software; and healthcare and life
sciences.]{.underline} (See sidebar "About the research.") In these
sectors, we see clusters of use cases [where AI can create upwards of
\$600 billion in economic value annually]{.underline}. (To provide a
sense of scale, the 2021 gross domestic product in Shanghai, China's
most populous city of nearly 28 million, was roughly \$680 billion.) In
some cases, [this value will come from revenue generated by AI-enabled
offerings, while in other cases, it will be generated by cost savings
through greater efficiency and productivity.]{.underline} These clusters
are likely to become battlegrounds for companies in each sector that
will help define the market leaders. [Unlocking the full potential of
these AI opportunities typically requires significant
investments]{.underline}---in some cases, much more than leaders might
expect---on multiple fronts, including the data and technologies that
will underpin AI systems, the right talent and organizational mindsets
to build these systems, and new business models and partnerships to
create data ecosystems, industry standards, and regulations. In our work
and global research, we find [many of these enablers are becoming
standard practice among companies getting the most value from
AI.]{.underline} To help leaders and investors marshal their resources
to accelerate, disrupt, and lead in AI, we dive into the research, first
sharing where the biggest opportunities lie in each sector and then
outlining the core enablers to be tackled first. Following the money to
the most promising sectors We looked at the AI market in China to
determine where AI could deliver the most value in the future. We
studied market projections at length and dug deep into country and
segment-level reports worldwide to see where AI was delivering the
greatest value across the global landscape. We then spoke in depth with
experts across sectors in China to understand where the greatest
opportunities could emerge next. Our research led us to [several
sectors: automotive, transportation, and logistics, which are
collectively expected to contribute the majority---around 64
percent---of the \$600 billion opportunity]{.underline}; manufacturing,
which will drive another 19 percent; enterprise software, contributing
13 percent; and healthcare and life sciences, at 4 percent of the
opportunity. Within each sector, our analysis shows the value-creation
opportunity concentrated within only two to three domains. These are
typically in areas where private-equity and venture-capital-firm
investments have been high in the past five years and successful proof
of concepts have been delivered. [Automotive, transportation, and
logistics China's auto market stands as the largest in the world, with
the number of vehicles in use surpassing that of the United
States]{.underline}. The sheer size---which we estimate to grow to [more
than 300 million passenger vehicles on the road in China by
2030]{.underline}---provides a fertile landscape of AI opportunities.
Indeed, our research finds that [AI could have the greatest potential
impact on this sector, delivering more than \$380 billion in economic
value]{.underline}. This value creation will likely be generated
predominantly in three areas: autonomous vehicles, personalization for
auto owners, and fleet asset management. Autonomous, or self-driving,
vehicles. [Autonomous vehicles make up the largest portion of value
creation in this sector (\$335 billion).]{.underline} Some of this new
value is expected to come from a reduction in financial losses, such as
medical, first-responder, and vehicle costs. Roadway accidents stand to
decrease an estimated 3 to 5 percent annually as autonomous vehicles
actively navigate their surroundings and make real-time driving
decisions without being subject to the many distractions, such as text
messaging, that tempt humans. Value would also come from savings
realized by drivers as cities and enterprises replace passenger vans and
buses with shared autonomous vehicles.4 Already, significant progress
has been made by both traditional automotive OEMs and AI players to
advance autonomous-driving capabilities to level 4 (where the driver
doesn't need to pay attention but can take over controls) and level 5
(fully autonomous capabilities in which inclusion of a steering wheel is
optional). For instance, WeRide, which achieved level 4
autonomous-driving capabilities,5 completed a pilot of its Robotaxi in
Guangzhou, with nearly 150,000 trips in one year without any accidents
with active liability.6 Personalized experiences for car owners. By
using AI to analyze sensor and GPS data---including vehicle-parts
conditions, fuel consumption, route selection, and steering habits---car
manufacturers and AI players can increasingly tailor recommendations for
hardware and software updates and personalize car owners' driving
experience. Automaker NIO's advanced driver-assistance system and
battery-management system, for instance, can track the health of
electric-car batteries in real time, diagnose usage patterns, and
optimize charging cadence to improve battery life span while drivers go
about their day. Our research finds [this could deliver \$30 billion in
economic value by reducing maintenance costs and unanticipated vehicle
failures, as well as generating incremental revenue for
companies]{.underline} that identify ways to monetize software updates
and new capabilities.7 Fleet asset management. [AI could also prove
critical in helping fleet managers better navigate China's immense
network of railway]{.underline}, highway, inland waterway, and civil
aviation routes, which are some of the longest in the world. Our
research finds that [\$15 billion in value creation could emerge as OEMs
and AI players specializing in logistics develop operations
research]{.underline} optimizers that can analyze IoT data and identify
more fuel-efficient routes and lower-cost maintenance stops for fleet
operators.8 One automotive OEM in China now offers fleet owners and
operators an AI-driven management system for monitoring fleet locations,
tracking fleet conditions, and analyzing trips and routes. It is
estimated to save up to 15 percent in fuel and maintenance costs.
Manufacturing In manufacturing, China is evolving its reputation from a
low-cost manufacturing hub for toys and clothes to a leader in precision
manufacturing for processors, chips, engines, and other high-end
components. Our findings [show AI can help facilitate this shift from
manufacturing execution to manufacturing innovation and create \$115
billion in economic value]{.underline}. The majority of this value
creation (\$100 billion) will likely come from innovations in process
design through the use of various AI applications, such as collaborative
robotics that create the next-generation assembly line, and digital
twins that replicate real-world assets for use in simulation and
optimization engines.9 With digital twins, manufacturers, machinery and
robotics providers, and system automation providers can simulate, test,
and validate manufacturing-process outcomes, such as product yield or
production-line productivity, before commencing large-scale production
so they can identify costly process inefficiencies early. One local
electronics manufacturer uses wearable sensors to capture and digitize
hand and body movements of workers to model human performance on its
production line. It then optimizes equipment parameters and setups---for
example, by changing the angle of each workstation based on the worker's
height---to reduce the likelihood of worker injuries while improving
worker comfort and productivity. The remainder of value creation in this
sector (\$15 billion) is expected to come from AI-driven improvements in
product development.10 [Companies could use digital twins to rapidly
test and validate new product designs to reduce R&D costs, improve
product quality, and drive new product innovation]{.underline}. On the
global stage, Google has offered a glimpse of what's possible: it has
used AI to rapidly assess how different component layouts will alter a
chip's power consumption, performance metrics, and size. This approach
can yield an optimal chip design in a fraction of the time design
engineers would take alone. [Enterprise software]{.underline} As in
other countries, companies based in China are undergoing digital and AI
transformations, leading to the emergence of new local
enterprise-software industries to support the necessary technological
foundations. Solutions delivered by these companies [are estimated to
deliver another \$80 billion in economic value]{.underline}. Offerings
for cloud and AI tooling are expected to provide more than half of this
value creation (\$45 billion).11 In one case, a local cloud provider
serves more than 100 local banks and insurance companies in China with
an integrated data platform that enables them to operate across both
cloud and on-premises environments and reduces the cost of database
development and storage. In another case, an AI tool provider in China
has developed a shared AI algorithm platform that can help its data
scientists automatically train, predict, and update the model for a
given prediction problem. Using the shared platform has reduced model
production time from three months to about two weeks. AI-driven
software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications are expected to contribute the
remaining \$35 billion in economic value in this category.12 Local SaaS
application developers can apply multiple AI techniques (for instance,
computer vision, natural-language processing, machine learning) to help
companies make predictions and decisions across enterprise functions in
finance and tax, human resources, supply chain, and cybersecurity. A
leading financial institution in China has deployed a local AI-driven
SaaS solution that uses AI bots to offer personalized training
recommendations to employees based on their career path. Healthcare and
life sciences [In recent years, China has stepped up its investment in
innovation in healthcare and life sciences with AI]{.underline}. China's
"14th Five-Year Plan" targets 7 percent annual growth by 2025 for R&D
expenditure, of which at least 8 percent is devoted to basic research.13
One area of focus is accelerating drug discovery and increasing the odds
of success, which is a significant global issue. In 2021, global pharma
R&D spend reached \$212 billion, compared with \$137 billion in 2012,
with an approximately 5 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Drug
discovery takes 5.5 years on average, which not only delays patients'
access to innovative therapeutics but also shortens the patent
protection period that rewards innovation. Despite improved success
rates for new-drug development, only the top 20 percent of
pharmaceutical companies worldwide realized a breakeven on their R&D
investments after seven years. Another top priority is improving patient
care, and Chinese AI start-ups today are working to build the country's
reputation for providing more accurate and reliable healthcare in terms
of diagnostic outcomes and clinical decisions. Our research suggests
that [AI in R&D could add more than \$25 billion in economic
value]{.underline} in three specific areas: faster drug discovery,
clinical-trial optimization, and clinical-decision support. Rapid drug
discovery. Novel drugs (patented prescription drugs) currently account
for less than 30 percent of the total market size in China (compared
with more than 70 percent globally), indicating a significant
opportunity from introducing novel drugs empowered by AI in discovery.
We estimate that [using AI to accelerate target identification and novel
molecules design could contribute up to \$10 billion]{.underline} in
value.14 Already more than 20 AI start-ups in China funded by
private-equity firms or local hyperscalers are collaborating with
traditional pharmaceutical companies or independently working to develop
novel therapeutics. Insilico Medicine, by using an end-to-end generative
AI engine for target identification, molecule design, and lead
optimization, discovered a preclinical candidate for pulmonary fibrosis
in less than 18 months at a cost of under \$3 million. This represented
a significant reduction from the average timeline of six years and an
average cost of more than \$18 million from target discovery to
preclinical candidate. This antifibrotic drug candidate has now
successfully completed a Phase 0 clinical study and entered a Phase I
clinical trial. Clinical-trial optimization. Our research suggests that
[another \$10 billion in economic value could result from optimizing
clinical-study designs]{.underline} (process, protocols, sites),
optimizing trial delivery and execution (hybrid trial-delivery model),
and generating real-world evidence.15 These AI use cases can reduce the
time and cost of clinical-trial development, provide a better experience
for patients and healthcare professionals, and enable higher quality and
compliance. For instance, a global top 20 pharmaceutical company
leveraged AI in combination with process improvements to reduce the
clinical-trial enrollment timeline by 13 percent and save 10 to 15
percent in external costs. The global pharmaceutical company prioritized
three areas for its tech-enabled clinical-trial development. To
accelerate trial design and operational planning, it utilized the power
of both internal and external data for optimizing protocol design and
site selection. For streamlining site and patient engagement, it
established an ecosystem with API standards to leverage internal and
external innovations. To establish a clinical-trial development cockpit,
it aggregated and visualized operational trial data to enable end-to-end
clinical-trial operations with full transparency so it could predict
potential risks and trial delays and proactively take action.
Clinical-decision support. Our findings indicate that the use of machine
learning algorithms on medical images and data (including examination
results and symptom reports) to predict diagnostic outcomes and support
clinical decisions could generate around \$5 billion in economic
value.16 A leading AI start-up in medical imaging now applies computer
vision and machine learning algorithms on optical coherence tomography
results from retinal images. It automatically searches and identifies
the signs of dozens of chronic illnesses and conditions, such as
diabetes, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis, expediting the diagnosis
process and increasing early detection of disease.

### AT: Growth Not Sustainable

#### AI creates a "virtuous cycle" of economic growth in China.

Daily, 2021.07.10,

Of course, it\'s right to recognize the supremacy of the US and China.
The AI research infrastructure they have built has translated into an
unassailable advantage over other competing countries in Europe, North
America and Asia. This is due to a number of factors: the depth of their
capital markets, the richness of their skills bases, the dominant
position of their cash-rich technology companies, and the data
generation capacity of their vast populations. However, the economic
dividends from AI are not reserved for the researchers. [The majority of
the economic value promised by the AI revolution will be captured
through innovation and application of AI technologies in
industry]{.underline}. Enterprises and policymakers the world over
should recognize that the AI dividend is theirs for the taking. AI is a
fundamentally open science. It is fierce, open competition in academia
that drives global research forward. The relatively open borders to data
flows and digital services mean the latest technological breakthroughs
in one part of the world are quite quickly made available, and
adaptable, to businesses everywhere else. [When it comes to AI
application in industry, ambitious economies can learn from China\'s
achievements]{.underline}. [China has managed to establish a culture of
tech]{.underline}nology [adoption and data sharing]{.underline} in
consumer interactions and business practices [that give it a distinct
edge]{.underline}. [There are three factors behind this.]{.underline}
The [first is Chinese businesses\' openness toward technological trial
and error]{.underline}. Chinese enterprises have demonstrated a
fundamentally positive and flexible attitude to digital solutions over
the past two decades, which served to accelerate AI integration and
innovation. [International executive surveys]{.underline}, such as the
World Economic Forum Future of Jobs report, [consistently rank China No
1 in the world]{.underline}－or close to it－[for its people\'s attitude
toward AI adoption]{.underline}. [Second, technology uptake is helped by
China\'s robust and ambitious policy framework.]{.underline} [The
country\'s 14th Five-Year Plan]{.underline} (2021-25) [crystallizes the
national goal of \"deep integration\" of]{.underline} the internet, big
data, and [AI into various industries]{.underline}. And the Chinese
government has recently begun to tighten regulation on AI development
and internet companies, but the repercussions of China\'s broadly
positive policy footing can be seen in the rate of investment taking
place. [The]{.underline} publicly funded, [\$2.1 billion AI-focused
technology research park on the outskirts of Beijing is one
example]{.underline}. More broadly, [China accounts for almost 40
percent of new industrial robot installations globally]{.underline},
over three times more than second-placed Japan. And [third, China has
established a world-class skills base to]{.underline} not only [develop
AI solutions]{.underline} but integrate them into industries too. The
rapid expansion of China\'s pool of computer science and engineering
graduates in recent years has been a core pillar of economic planning.
[China ranks third in the world for \"AI skills
penetration\",]{.underline} according to Stanford University\'s AI Index
report[. Which means AI skills are]{.underline} 1.4 times [more likely
to be required in Chinese occupations]{.underline} than the global
average. **[These three factors have created a virtuous cycle in
China]{.underline}**. [Rapidly growing Chinese companies are bringing AI
products to the market]{.underline} and competing to pursue AI solutions
[that are]{.underline} customized to fit into Chinese scenarios. These
solutions are [embraced by receptive businesses, willing to
quickly]{.underline} test, adopt, and [integrate AI products into their
activities. In doing so, they generate vast amounts of data]{.underline}
in return, [which allow developers to constantly]{.underline} and nimbly
[improve their AI products, and lead to innovative spill-over
applications]{.underline} in different industries. What\'s more, [the
growing domestic market justifies high levels of investment]{.underline}
in the technology industry. The openness to AI across the wider economy
is indirectly fuelling Chinese innovation in high-tech computer chip
manufacturing and software development. [Other Asian countries can
benefit from China\'s recent experience in AI, in pursuing their own
virtuous cycle of AI integration]{.underline}. That means cultivating an
open attitude toward AI adoption and integration within industry,
emphasizing technology skills development and retention, as well as
being open to foreign investment and technology trade. Chinese
technology enterprises are major sources of funding for tech
entrepreneurship in the wider Asian continent－which itself leads to
valuable knowledge spill-overs around the region. The AI economic
dividend is not a prize being fought over by two international
heavyweights. It\'s a universal economic opportunity that all Asian
countries can pursue and will shape the competitive landscape across the
region over the next decade.

On the plus side[, **AI's effect on productivity** could be **crucial to
China's future economic growth**]{.underline} as the population ages.
According to a McKinsey Global Institute report, [AI-led automation can
give the Chinese economy a]{.underline} [productivity injection that
would add 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points to **GDP growth**
annually,]{.underline} depending on the speed of adoption. [With
its]{.underline} biggest [tech companies driving significant investments
in R&D,]{.underline} [China is one of the leading global hubs of AI
developmen]{.underline}t. Its advantages include a vast population and
diverse industry mix that have the potential to generate huge volumes of
data and provide an enormous market. But [China will need to focus on
building its innovation capacity]{.underline}. The United States and the
United Kingdom are currently producing more influential AI research, and
the more robust US ecosystem nurtures more competitive AI startups.
Realizing AI's economic potential in China also depends on its actual
adoption---not just among the technology giants but across China's
traditional industries. Achieving this goal will require building
strategic awareness among business leaders, developing technical
know-how, and overcoming implementation costs. AI capabilities have
exciting and far-reaching potential to enhance human welfare by
improving health care, the environment, security, and education. At the
same time, AI also raises complex ethical, legal, and security questions
surrounding issues such as privacy, discrimination, liability, and
regulation. Prudential governance should be put in place as AI is
introduced into society on a broader scale. Although the market will
drive the development and adoption of AI, the right policy framework can
establish a healthy environment for growth. Five priorities can form the
basis of China's AI strategy: building a robust data ecosystem; spurring
adoption of AI within traditional industries; strengthening the pipeline
of specialized AI talent; ensuring that education and training systems
are up to the challenge; and establishing an ethical and legal consensus
among Chinese citizens and in the global community. [The technology
industry is becoming increasingly global. China has the capability and
opportunity to lead international collaboration in the development and
governance of AI, ensuring that this **breakthrough technology** will
**positively contribute to the general welfare of all
humanity**.]{.underline}

### AT: Collapse Inevitable

#### AI key to sustainable Chinese econ growth. 

**Fan and Liu '21** (Decheng Fan, Kairan Liu, "The Relationship between
Artificial Intelligence and China's Sustainable Economic Growth: Focused
on the Mediating Effects of Industrial Structural Change,"
Sustainability 2021, 13, 11542. https://doi.org/10.3390/ su132011542

With the rapid development of the technological revolution, China is
facing a dual challenge of technological upgrading and economic growth[.
The wide application of artificial intelligence has gradually become a
new way to achieve high-quality economic development]{.underline}. This
study explored the impact of AI on China's economic growth and the role
of industrial structure in this relationship. The empirical results show
the following: [China's economy has entered a period of slowdown, and
industrial changes alone can no longer meet the new demands of
development]{.underline}. It is even facing the structural irrationality
formed by the excessive pursuit of structural upgrading[. The
application of artificial intelligence makes a significant positive
contribution to economic growth, and **AI has gradually become the core
driver of China's sustainable economic growth.**]{.underline} [AI
development not only directly promotes regional development, but also
enables economic growth by avoiding excessive industrial upgrading.
Although the change in resource allocation ratio may lead to a lower
rationalization of the industrial structure, **the total effect of AI on
economic development remains positive**.]{.underline} The relationship
between AI and economic growth has significant regional differences. For
the central and western areas, the direct effect of AI on the economy is
not obvious, but the mediating effect by inhibiting the upgrading of
industrial structure is always significant. And AI upgrading may cause a
lower level of industrial structure rationalization, but this mediating
effect also benefits regional economic growth. The role of AI is
influenced by the economic environment. Before the financial crisis in
2008, the level of R&D and the application of intelligent technology was
low and could not fully play its role in driving the economy.
Additionally, [in the late financial crisis, the rise of AI gradually
became an important support for economic recovery and stable
development.]{.underline}

### AT: Growth Resilient

#### AI key to China manufacturing model of economic stability.

Factory---And It\'s Designing the Future With AI," Time, 2021.08.11,

[For many years now, China has been the world's factory]{.underline}.
Even in 2020, as other economies struggled with the effects of the
pandemic, [China's manufacturing output was \$3.854
trillion,]{.underline} up from the previous year, accounting for nearly
a third of the global market. But if you are still thinking of China's
factories as sweatshops, it's probably time to change your perception.
[The Chinese economic recovery from its short-lived pandemic blip has
been boosted by its world-beating adoption of artificial intelligence
(AI).]{.underline} After overtaking the U.S. in 2014, [China now has a
significant lead over the rest of the world in AI patent
applications.]{.underline} In academia, [China recently surpassed the
U.S. in the number of both AI research publications and journal
citations]{.underline}. C[ommercial applications are flourishing: a new
wave of automation and AI infusion is crashing across a swath of
sectors, combining software, hardware and robotics. A]{.underline}s a
society, we have experienced three distinct industrial revolutions:
steam power, electricity and information technology. I believe [AI is
the engine fueling the fourth industrial revolution
globally,]{.underline} digitizing and automating everywhere. **[China is
at the forefront in manifesting this unprecedented
change.]{.underline}** Chinese traditional industries are confronting
rising labor costs thanks to a declining working population and slowing
population growth. The answer is [AI,]{.underline} which [reduces
operational costs, enhances efficiency and productivity-, and generates
revenue growth]{.underline}. For example, Guangzhou-based
agricultural-technology company XAG, a Sinovation Ventures portfolio
company, is sending drones, robots and sensors to rice, wheat and cotton
fields, automating seeding, pesticide spraying, crop development and
weather monitoring. XAG's R150 autonomous vehicle, which sprays crops,
has recently been deployed in the U.K. to be used on apples,
strawberries and blackberries. Some companies are rolling out robots in
new and unexpected sectors. MegaRobo, a Beijing-based life-science
automation company also backed by Sinovation Ventures, designs AI and
robots to safely perform repetitive and precise laboratory work in
universities, pharmaceutical companies and more, reducing to zero the
infection risk to lab workers. It's not just startups; established
market leaders are also leaning into AI. EP Equipment, a manufacturer of
lithium-powered warehouse forklifts founded in Hangzhou 28 years ago,
has with Sinovation Ventures' backing launched autonomous models that
are able to maneuver themselves in factories and on warehouse floors.
Additionally Yutong Group, a leading bus manufacturer with over 50
years' history, already has a driverless Mini Robobus on the streets of
three cities in partnership with autonomous vehicle unicorn WeRide.
Where is all this headed? I can foresee a time when [robots and AI will
take over the manufacturing, design, delivery and even marketing of most
goods---potentially reducing costs to a small increment over the cost of
materials]{.underline}. Robots will become self-replicating,
self-repairing and even partially self-designing. Houses and apartment
buildings will be designed by AI and use prefabricated modules that
robots put together like toy blocks. And just-in-time autonomous public
transportation, from robo-buses to robo-scooters, will take us anywhere
we want to go[. It will be years before these visions of the future
enter the mainstream. But China is laying the groundwork right now,
setting itself up to be a leader not only in how much it manufactures,
but also in how intelligently it does it.]{.underline}

#### NATO is anti China -- its global security threats are growing

BRUSSELS --- China's rising military ambitions are presenting NATO with
challenges that must be addressed, the 30-nation Western alliance said
Monday, the first time it has portrayed the expanding reach and
capabilities of the Chinese armed forces in such a potentially
confrontational way. [The description of China]{.underline}, contained
in the communiqué [issued at the]{.underline} conclusion of a [one-day
summit meeting]{.underline} attended by President Biden and others,
[reflected a new concern over how China intends to wield its rapidly
growing military might and offensive cyber technologies in the coming
years]{.underline}. At the Group of 7 meeting in Britain that ended on
Sunday, Mr. Biden and his counterparts agreed to jointly counter China's
growing economic dominance. On Monday, [NATO countries warned that China
increasingly poses a global security problem]{.underline} as well,
signaling a fundamental shift in the attentions of an institution
devoted to protecting Europe and North America --- not Asia. The first
minor reference to China in a NATO statement, not even a communiqué, was
at the London summit in 2019, but global concerns have rapidly
accelerated since then. Both Mr. [Biden]{.underline} and President
Donald J. Trump before him put more [emphasis on the threats they say
China poses, as an authoritarian political system with growing military
spending and ambitions, including a budding military cooperation with
Russia]{.underline}. [China is at the center of Mr. Biden's assertion
that democracies are in an existential confrontation with
autocracies]{.underline}. "The democratic values that undergird our
alliance are under increasing pressure, both internally and externally,"
the president told reporters Monday evening after the summit meeting.
"Russia and China are both seeking to drive a wedge in our
trans-Atlantic solidarity." On Monday, NATO's secretary general, Jens
Stoltenberg, said China's rapid expansion of its military forces
presents the alliance with challenges that must be addressed
together.China's growing influence on international policies presents
challenges to alliance security. [Leaders agreed]{.underline} that we
need to address such challenges together as an alliance, and [that we
need to engage with China to defend our security interests]{.underline}.
We are concerned by China's coercive policies, which stand in contrast
to the fundamental values enshrined in the Washington Treaty. China is
rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger
number of sophisticated delivery systems. [NATO leaders called on China
to uphold its international commitments and to act responsibly in the
international system, including in space, cyber and maritime domains, in
keeping with its role as a major power]{.underline}. And of course, the
important thing is that we agreed how we should strengthen and adapt the
alliance by doing more together. But if we are going to do more
together, we also need more investments together and, therefore, I
welcome that. Today, we agree on all three budgets, not only the
military budget, which was the original proposal. In its communiqué,
negotiated by consensus from all 30 members, NATO is cautious in its
characterization of China. Russia is repeatedly described as a "threat"
to NATO in the document, with criticisms of the buildup in Russian
weaponry, its hacking and disinformation assaults on Western countries,
the 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and other aggressive acts.
By contrast, China is described as presenting "challenges." But those
challenges are considerable. The NATO secretary-general, Jens
Stoltenberg, has said [China now has the second-largest military budget
after the United States and the world's largest navy. Beijing is
strengthening its nuclear stockpile]{.underline} and developing more
sophisticated missiles and ships. "China is not our adversary, but the
balance of power is shifting,'' Mr. Stoltenberg said on Monday. "And
[China is coming closer to us. We see them in cyberspace, we see China
in Africa, but we also see China investing heavily in our own critical
infrastructure]{.underline}," he said. "We need to respond together as
an alliance." [China has sent ships into the Mediterranean and through
the Arctic; it has also conducted military exercises with Russia in
NATO's backyard]{.underline}, built bases in Africa, and owns
significant infrastructure in Europe, including the Greek port of
Piraeus. China's army has hacked computers to steal industrial and
military secrets all over the globe and engaged in disinformation in
NATO societies. And with its effort to deploy 5G networks across Africa,
the Middle East and Europe, Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications
giant, has created new anxiety that it could control the communications
infrastructure needed by NATO. In a discussion of "multifaceted threats"
and "systemic competition from assertive and authoritarian powers" in
the communiqué, NATO says that "Russia's aggressive actions constitute a
threat to Euro-Atlantic security." While China is not called a threat,
[NATO states that "China's growing influence and international policies
can present challenges that we need to address together as an
alliance.]{.underline}" NATO promised to "engage China with a view to
defending the security interests of the alliance'' and said it planned
to increase partnerships with more countries in the Indo-Pacific. Much
further into the document, China comes up again, described as presenting
"systemic challenges" to the "rules-based international order." In a
gesture toward diplomacy and engagement, the alliance vows to maintain
"a constructive dialogue with China where possible," including on the
issue of climate change, and calls for China to become more transparent
about its military and especially its "nuclear capabilities and
doctrine." Chinese officials reacted sharply to the NATO communiqué, as
they have to other statements from G7 leaders made in the previous days.
[The alliance's characterization of the challenges posed by China was "a
slander of China's peaceful development, a misjudgment of the
international situation and its own role, and a continuation of the Cold
War mentality,"]{.underline} the country's mission to the European Union
in Brussels said in a post on Weibo. NATO leaders on Monday also agreed
to spend next year updating the alliance's 2010 strategic concept, which
11 years ago viewed Russia as a potential partner and never mentioned
China. New challenges from cyberwarfare, artificial intelligence and
disinformation, as well as new missile and warhead technologies, must be
considered to preserve deterrence, the alliance said. And Article 5 of
its founding treaty --- an attack on one is an attack on all --- will be
"clarified" to include threats to satellites in space and coordinated
cyberattacks. This NATO meeting was mostly a warm embrace of President
Biden, who in contrast to his predecessor has expressed deep belief in
the alliance and in the importance of American participation in the
multilateral institutions Washington established after the horrors of
World War II. The contrast to Mr. Trump's May 2017 NATO summit was
remarked on by many other leaders. Then, Mr. Trump was particularly
angered by the expense and lavish use of glass in NATO's new \$1.2
billion headquarters. Mr. Trump also defied the expectations of even his
own aides and refused to announce support for NATO's Article 5, a
central tenet of collective defense. Mr. Biden quickly declared Monday
that the alliance is "critically important for U.S. interests" and
called Article 5 a "sacred obligation." He added: "I just want all of
Europe to know that the United States is there." Prime Minister Mario
Draghi of Italy spoke for many when he connected this summit with the
Group of 7 summit meeting just concluded in Britain and compared them
unfavorably with the period of Mr. Trump. "This summit is part of the
process of reaffirming, rebuilding the fundamental alliances of the
United States," which were "weakened by the previous administration,"
Mr. Draghi said. And he pointed to Mr. Biden's similarly important
meetings on Tuesday with the leaders of the European Union, which Mr.
Trump considered an economic competitor and even a foe. "We are here to
reaffirm these alliances, but also to reaffirm the importance of the
European Union," Mr. Draghi said. Another key element of Mr. Biden's
European tour, which will conclude on Wednesday in Geneva, where he
meets President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for a highly anticipated
conversation, is how the democracies of Asia and the West can stand up
to the authoritarian challenge. While Russia is a particular threat to
NATO and the Euro-Atlantic world, it is not an economic rival. Biden
Criticizes Trump at NATO Summit President Biden criticized his
predecessor on Monday at a press conference after a one-day NATO summit,
accusing former President Donald J. Trump of "phony populism." The
Republican Party is vastly diminished in numbers. The leadership of the
Republican Party is fractured, and the Trump wing of the party is the
bulk of the party but it makes up a significant minority of the American
people. It is a shock and surprise that what's happened in terms of
consequence of President Trump's phony populism has --- has happened.
And it is disappointing that so many of my Republican colleagues in the
Senate, who I know know better, have been reluctant to take on, for
example, an investigation because they're worried about being primaried.
But at the end of the day, we've been through periods like this in
American history before, where there has been this reluctance to take a
chance on your re-election because of the nature of your party's
politics at the moment. I think this is passing --- I don't mean easily
passing. That's why it's so important that I succeed in my agenda. The
agenda, whether it's dealing with the vaccine, the economy,
infrastructure, it's important that we demonstrate we can make progress
and continue to make progress. And I think we're going to be able to do
that. Speaking Monday night, Mr. Biden called Mr. Putin "a worthy
adversary" and said he would look for areas of cooperation with Russia,
while laying down red lines about Russian efforts to disrupt democratic
societies. "I'm going to make clear to President Putin that there are
areas where we can cooperate, if he chooses," Mr. Biden said. "And if he
chooses not to cooperate, and acts in a way that he has in the past,
relative to cybersecurity and some other activities, then we will
respond. We will respond in kind." [It is the rise of a rich,
aggressive, authoritarian China, however, that Mr. Biden identifies as a
major challenge to the United States and its allies, and his intention
in Europe is to solicit allied support for efforts to meet that
challenge --- militarily, technologically and economically]{.underline}.
While NATO has a role to play, so does the European Union, the largest
economic bloc in the world, with deep trading ties to China. The
European Union has been hardening its views of China in the face of
Beijing's human rights behavior at home and trade and espionage
practices abroad. But the Europeans do not see China as quite the threat
perceived by Washington. That disparity is also true in NATO, despite
the new communiqué on China. [Some NATO members, especially those
nearest to Russia in Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic nations,
are anxious that the shift in focus to China does not divert resources
and attention from the Russian threat]{.underline}. Mr. Biden made a
point of meeting the leaders of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in
Brussels before his meeting with Mr. Putin. NATO troops are deployed in
all four countries. But even Britain, probably Washington's closest
ally, expressed some wariness about confrontation with China. Asked at
the NATO meeting about China, Prime Minister Boris [Johnson warned
against a "new Cold War," while acknowledging that China's rise was a
"gigantic fact in our lives."]{.underline} Similarly, Chancellor Angela
Merkel of Germany said after the meeting: "If you look at the
cyberthreats and the hybrid threats, [if you look at the cooperation
between Russia and China, you cannot simply ignore China.]{.underline}''
But she also said: "One must not overrate it, either --- we need to find
the right balance."

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA --- When the top leaders of NATO countries meet next
week in Spain, the discussion will be dominated by the Ukraine war and
how to deter further Russian aggression in Europe. But in the latest
sign the Western military alliance is trying to expand its focus
eastward[, the NATO summit will also deal with the challenges posed by
China]{.underline}, perhaps in a more direct way than any of its
previous meetings. For the first time, [the NATO summit will include the
top leaders of four Asian countries: Japan, South Korea, Australia, and
New Zealand. None are NATO members, but each is wary of China's growing
influence and coercion.]{.underline} Since 2020, NATO has stepped up
cooperation with the four Asian democracies, which it refers to as
"Asia-Pacific partners.\" The engagement underscores a profound shift in
the scope and priorities of NATO, which was meant to focus on the
collective defense of its North American and European member states.
[But China's growing global presence, as well as its expanding military
cooperation with Russia, has made it much harder for NATO to
ignore]{.underline}. While there is no talk of NATO accepting Asian
countries as members, the alliance's new Asia focus will likely endure,
according to many observers. "I do not expect that NATO will now expand
into the Indo-Pacific and create a new Asian NATO kind of organization,"
said Zsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, a former political adviser in the European
Parliament. "I do expect, though, that [cooperation with \[Asian\]
countries that face the growing threat of China\'s economic coercion and
aggressive behavior ... will converge more and more with European
democracies as well as the United States,"]{.underline} said Ferenczy,
assistant professor at National Dong Hwa University in Taiwan. Europe
sours on China NATO's eastward shift reflects not only an intensified
U.S.-China rivalry, but also changing European attitudes toward Beijing.
For decades, Europe prioritized stable ties with China, which in 2020
overtook the United States as the European Union's biggest trading
partner. But European views of China have soured under the leadership of
Chinese Communist Party chief Xi Jinping, whose government has become
more authoritarian at home and more aggressive abroad. NATO
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg speaks during a media conference
after a meeting of NATO defense ministers at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, June 16, 2022. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg speaks
during a media conference after a meeting of NATO defense ministers at
NATO headquarters in Brussels, June 16, 2022. [Under Xi, China has
obliterated democratic opposition in Hong Kong, increased military
threats against democratically ruled Taiwan, and been accused of
genocide against Uighur Muslims]{.underline}. Xi has also steadily
expanded China's military presence beyond its shores, most notably in
the South China Sea, where it has created military outposts over the
objections of its neighbors, which have overlapping territorial claims
with China. As part of its new "wolf warrior" approach to diplomacy,
[China has made clear it will retaliate against countries that criticize
Beijing or enact policies that go against its wishes]{.underline}. After
Lithuania opened a de facto embassy in Taiwan, which Beijing views as
its own territory, China downgraded diplomatic ties and imposed what
some say amounts to a trade boycott. The unannounced embargo affected
not only Lithuanian products, but also other European countries' goods
that incorporated Lithuanian components. [The pandemic has also helped
worsen Europe-China relations. China has been accused of not cooperating
sufficiently with a World Health Organization investigation into the
origins of the coronavirus, which first appeared in central
China]{.underline}. Instead, Chinese government-controlled media have
suggested the virus originated elsewhere, such as the United States or
Italy. [Changing NATO approach Europe's growing skepticism of China can
also be observed in NATO's recent history]{.underline}. In 2019, China
was included for the first time in a NATO statement -- but only in a
single sentence [saying Beijing "presents both opportunities and
challenges]{.underline}." By 2021, NATO's tone had shifted. A joint
communique issued in Brussels said [China presents "systemic challenges
to the rules-based international order]{.underline}." The statement also
slammed China's "coercive" policies, "opaque" military modernization,
use of "disinformation," and military exercises with Russia in the
Euro-Atlantic area[. A major reason for NATO's more combative tone is
the Ukraine war, which coincided with Beijing and Moscow declaring a "no
limits" partnership]{.underline}. Just weeks before Russia invaded
Ukraine, Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Beijing, where
they announced a broad plan to counter Western influence around the
world. Since Russia's invasion, China has attempted to portray itself as
a neutral party. But many European observers are not convinced, noting
China has consistently defended Russia from global criticism and instead
blamed Washington for engaging in a \"Cold War mindset\" that provoked
Moscow. Pierre Morcos, a visiting fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, said the Ukraine conflict has "confirmed the
growing strategic rapprochement between China and Russia." ["The war in
Ukraine has also demonstrated that the Euro-Atlantic area and the
Indo-Pacific region are deeply inter-connecte]{.underline}d. A crisis in
a region can have deep impacts on the other one," he said. That explains
why like-minded Asian countries are eager to play an active role in
supporting Ukraine and pushing back against Russia, Morcos said. "I
think that we will see growing coordination and consultations between
NATO and these countries in the future notably to discuss the
aftershocks of the war in Ukraine but also exchange about China's
capacities and activities," he added. Speaking at a forum earlier this
week, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg insisted the alliance does
not regard China as an adversary. However, he suggested the coming
summit would result in a statement acknowledging "[China poses some
challenges to our values, to our interests, \[and\] to our security."
China has responded angrily to NATO's eastward focus.]{.underline} At a
Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry briefing Thursday, spokesperson Wang
Wenbin accused NATO of engaging in a "highly dangerous" effort to create
hostile blocs in Asia. "NATO has already disrupted stability in Europe,"
he said. "It should not try to do the same to the Asia-Pacific and the
whole world."

Boasting of restored unity thanks to the arrival of U.S. President Joe
Biden, [NATO leaders on Monday declared that China poses increasing
dangers to the security of Western democracies]{.underline}. But they
then revealed deep disagreements over the urgency in confronting
Beijing, or even if it should be NATO's role at all. In their closing
communiqué of an afternoon summit at NATO headquarters in Brussels, the
[leaders used remarkably forceful language to describe China as now
their most troublesome rival after Russia --- given Beijing's
fast-expanding nuclear arsenal, stepped-up military cooperation with
Moscow, and increasing use of disinformation]{.underline}. "[China's
stated ambitions and assertive behavior present systemic challenges
to]{.underline} the rules-based international order and to areas
relevant to [Alliance security,]{.underline}" the leaders wrote. "We are
concerned by those coercive policies which stand in contrast to the
fundamental values enshrined in the Washington Treaty," NATO's founding
charter. The historic shift in focus comes partly at the urging of
Biden, who has made clear he sees China as a growing threat. And NATO
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, eager to please the richest and most
powerful ally, has taken up the charge. Stoltenberg stressed that [China
was "not an adversary" but posed challenges that must be
answered,]{.underline} and he insisted that [NATO was not shifting
operations to Asia but protecting itself close to home]{.underline}.
"This is about taking care of a core responsibility to be able to
protect and defend all allies against any threat from any direction,"
Stoltenberg said at his closing news conference. "[Because we see China
is coming closer to us in cyberspace, we see them in Africa, we see them
in the Arctic, we see them trying to control our
infrastructure]{.underline}, we had the discussion about 5G." He noted
that the first-ever mention of China in a NATO leaders' communiqué was
from a summit in London in December 2019. "Before that, we didn't have
any language at all," he said. "In the current Strategic Concept, China
is not mentioned with a single word. Now, you can read a communiqué and
you see that we have seen a convergence of views among allies." But
there didn't seem to be much convergence when French President Emmanuel
Macron spoke to reporters just minutes later. "On China, as I said
during the meeting, I think I can say we shouldn't confuse our goals,"
Macron said. "NATO is a military organization, the issue of our
relationship with China isn't just a military issue. NATO is an
organization that concerns the North Atlantic, China has little to do
with the North Atlantic." "[So, it's very important that we don't
scatter ourselves and that we don't bias our relationship with China,"
he continued. "It is much larger than just the military issue. It is
economic. It is strategic. It is about values. It is
technological]{.underline}. And we should avoid distracting NATO which
already has many challenges." Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the
wealthiest European allied nation, stressed that Moscow still
represented the biggest threat --- a point evidenced by it being
mentioned 62 times in the communiqué to just 10 mentions of China.
"Russia, above all, is a major challenge," Merkel said. "China is
playing an increasing role, as is the entire Indo-Pacific region. This
is of course related to the fact that the United States of America, and
of course the transatlantic partners as a whole, are also a Pacific
nation. Here, [the economic and also the military rise of China is of
course an issue]{.underline}." But she also cited a risk of
overreaction. "[If you look at the cyber threats, the hybrid threats, if
you look at the cooperation between Russia and China, then you cannot
simply negate China]{.underline}," Merkel said. "In this respect, I do
not think that we should overestimate the importance of this, so we have
to find the right balance." Adding another layer of discord, Macron and
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte engaged in a terse exchange of words
during the leaders' meeting over their differing views on how Europe
should approach military and security policy. Macron, who has pushed for
greater military cooperation among EU countries and the development of
strategic autonomy, claimed most other EU leaders were with him and said
it was up to Rutte "to clarify his thoughts." Security analysts cite a
growing risk of a deep rift within the 30-nation NATO alliance [if China
becomes too great a focus, particularly because European militaries are
relatively limited in their capabilities and the U.S. could not
simultaneously manage a military conflict in Asia while also protecting
Europe along its borders with Russia]{.underline}. Biden, at his own
news conference after the summit, sought to focus on his overall
revitalization of transatlantic bonds, which were strained almost to a
breaking point by his predecessor Donald Trump. "Everyone in that room
understood the shared appreciation, quite frankly, that America is
back," he said, adding strong words about U.S. fidelity to NATO's
collective defense clause. "The U.S Commitment to Article 5 of the NATO
treaty is rock solid and unshakeable," he said. Biden suggested that
Russia and China posed similar risks to NATO. "[Russia and China are
both seeking to drive a wedge in our transatlantic
solidarity,"]{.underline} he said. And the president noted that when
NATO last focused on its overall strategic outlook, in 2010, "Russia was
considered a partner and China wasn't even mentioned." But some allies
made no mention of China whatsoever in their public comments, a
reflection of how, especially in Eastern Europe and the Baltics, Russia
is the sole focus. "The U.S. is aware of the threats faced by the Baltic
States and is well informed about Russia's increasingly aggressive
posture and its aim to integrate Belarus into Russian military
structures," Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said in a statement
following a meeting with Biden. One Central European official said that
there was clear recognition that Washington puts a priority on
containing China and European countries were not disappointed. "They
understand that China must be part of a new 'transatlantic bargain' to
preserve NATO's relevance for the U.S.," the official said, adding:
"Plus, the attention given to Russia was pretty substantial and
outspoken." Indeed, Biden's news conference focused overwhelmingly on
Russia, largely because of his summit meeting on Wednesday with
President Vladimir Putin. Asked about Putin's laughing, during a recent
television interview, over Biden saying he believed the Russian
president was a killer, Biden laughed dramatically. Asked about his
approach, in the context of Reagan's famous "trust but verify" approach
toward the Soviet Union, Biden reversed the phrase. "I'd verify first,
and then trust," he said "It's not about trusting, it's about agreeing.
You know when you write treaties with your adversaries, you don't say 'I
trust you.' You say this is what I expect and if you violate the
agreement we made, then the treaty is off, the agreement is off." Biden
did not retract the killer accusation but said he hoped Putin might
adopt a new approach. "I am hoping that President Putin concludes that
there is some interest in terms of his own interest in changing the
perception the world has of him in terms of whether or not he will
engage in behavior that is more consistent with what is considered to be
appropriate behavior for a head of state," he said. A second official
from Central Europe agreed that [allies were willing to put some
emphasis on China: "I think everyone, with very few exceptions in the
room, kind of recognized that both Russia and China are becoming
challenges to address and one can't talk just about one without
mentioning the other."]{.underline}

### AI Key to Hege

#### AI development is key to Chinese heg globally---unparalleled investment and development in the AI sector will put them at the front. 

**Pattanaik et al. 21** (Dr. Jajati K.Pattnaik is Associate Professor at
the Centre for West Asian Studies, School of International Studies,
Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.; Dr. Rudra P. Pradhan is
Associate Professor at the Department of Humanities & Social Sciences,
BITS Pilani, "China's AI-Driven Techno-Economic Hegemony,"
<http://mainstreamweekly.net/article10983.html>,)

China is seen to be investing heavily in the Artificial Intelligence
(AI) driven techno- economic domain to shape and control the
transnational space in order to gain global market advantages. It is
noticed that the world mode of production which has evolved from
manufacturing economy to knowledge economy --- a phenomena of fourth
Industrial Revolution \[1\] --- largely thrust upon algorithm, big data
and decision tree as new mode of wealth creation to integrate production
variables for higher profitability. Taking a cue from this, [Beijing has
provided sufficient scope to boost AI culture]{.underline} through
computer gaming like 'Alpha Go' which is defined as an abstract strategy
of computer programme-based board game played between the two players.
The event was moderately covered in Western media. In China, however, it
was a major national event and some 280 million viewers watched the game
live and **[Beijing described the event as 'Sputnik moment' for AI
development in China]{.underline}**. \[2\] While the older generation
Chinese familiar with revolution, cold war, and contradictions of
capitalism and communism may not appreciate or understand the new
generation themes and market potentials of gaming, it is the young and
tech savoir-faire younger generation that drove the cyber market as the
largest users. China's 2016 AI strategy clearly highlighted its AI
investment plans and long-distance objectives. The document clarified
that it would focus on linking Chinese economic development through
higher AI investments and explored possibilities for funding its
sources. \[3\] The State Council- the chief administrative authority of
the Peoples Republic of China ([PRC]{.underline}) released the country's
AI strategy document titled as "New Generation Artificial Intelligence
Development Plan" in July 2017. The strategic plan has three clear
objectives. First, it [aims to become AI world leader by
2030]{.underline}. Second, to capitalize and monetize AI economy as a
trillion Yuan industry i.e. US \$ 150 billion [and]{.underline} finally,
[to emerge as the driving force in defining AI governance in the
world]{.underline}. \[4\] [The perspective plan proposed to inject a
financial intervention of US \$ 150 billion for AI intervention in the
Chinese industrial productivity.]{.underline} \[5\] Grand objective is
indeed to become AI Super Power by 2030- a 15 year vision plan! If the
global movement towards AI becomes a reality which is likely to be the
case, future super powers will not wage wars with bombs and armed forces
but those who would be waging war from their AI labs with far reaching
consequences. They will be able to alter enemy country's financial data,
disrupt their energy supply, change climate and river course and much
more with huge damaging impact. Further, [China's]{.underline} "[Three
Year]{.underline} Action [Plan]{.underline} for Promoting Development of
a New Generation AI Industry (2018-20)" [added AI as a national priority
while]{.underline} benchmarking the already accomplished task on the
sector. The plan categorically [outlines China's AI development focus
areas and its proliferation strategy including investment and possible
AI infrastructure.]{.underline} In order to develop AI ecosystem,
specific industries and sub-technologies within the scope of AI were to
be built or supported with necessary infrastructure. China's prominent
AI driven industries, technologies, and products are: (a)Integrated AI
Systems- drones, service robots, networked vehicles, image assisted
medical diagnostic systems, video image identification systems,
voice-interface systems, translation modules and smart home appliances
etc.; (b) smart hard ware and soft ware Consolidation Modules: neural
network chips, sensors, open source platforms and several such modules;
and(c) network security and other industrial public support systems to
improve the artificial intelligence development environment standard
testing and intellectual property service platform, intelligent
manufacturing and industrial support resource pool, intelligent network
infrastructure and range of such industrial and domestic use systems.
\[6\] AI Economy & Global Investments AI economy could grow up to US \$
15trillion by 2030 as per Oxford Insight. Global North is far well
positioned than their Global South counterparts to benefit from the
emerging AI economy and ecosystem. As AI driven economic advantages
begin to benefit the North more, the countries of South are expected to
lose out leading to rising global inequalities. The fourth Industrial
revolution driven by algorithm and AI therefore could drive Global South
countries to further economic challenges as was the case in earlier
industrial revolution period. As the narrative goes, **[China is
investing far too many dollars than the US in the emerging AI sector and
certainly spending more in military AI for a distant future world order
advantage.]{.underline}** Washington policy circles further intended to
caution the US policy planners that their country's global tech
advantage as well as their economic security and their deep rooted
democratic values could be well under threat from Beijing's AI
aggression. Irrespective of the narratives, [China's AI investments are
certainly a matter of concern for]{.underline} the American policy
planners and undoubtedly there is [Washington-Beijing AI super power
race]{.underline} and rivalry. **[Beijing]{.underline}** meanwhile
**[has a]{.underline}** very conducive industrial climate. It has
achieved a visible alignment between the government, private sector,
investors, and the academia towards a **[larger 'China Dream'- the great
geopolitical game in which AI is a techno weapon.]{.underline}** Dozens
of Chinese MNCs and several other critical players and stakeholders are
projected towards this end in a rather covert and closed loop ecosystem.
Moreover, China's large domestic market, 1.4billion population and large
consumer data base increasingly open to 'AlphaGo', cyber gaming and
myriad formats of AI based economic modules add to its advantages as
well. \[7\] What does it mean to the World? AI driven techno-economic
incorporation in economic globalization is also maturing to its next
generation to encompass digi-currency, block-chain, beidou navigation
system to smart warfare including cyber aggression that propose to
change the way business of the world ever operated. Economy to Warfare,
productivity to travel and even currency and global transaction modes
are all set to undergo transformation. Technology and factors of
production being in spectacular alliance to deliver windfall economic
gains and unusual control over global resources, there is huge global
competition to take advantage of this alliance and all its
possibilities. [While Western Europe followed by North America and later
Japan were the industrial leaders in the last century, the game of
leadership is visibly shifting to Asia in the 21stcentury. **China's
emergence as a** **techno**-economic **power** in the last over two
decades **is set to recast the** language and **order of the game
itself**.]{.underline} Beijing's decisive control over strategic and
critical industrial use materials like steel and rare-earth brings it to
an enviable position of global techno-economic productivity landscape.
Assured of this economic success and confident of huge forex reserve,
China's export led economic growth has nourished a larger ambition-
popularly referred as 'China Dream' which is a native Chinese
imagination of creating a 'World Order' that is Sino-centric in
character. It seems to alter 'White' and 'Euro Centric' world order and
replace it with Chinese variant large called as 'Tianxia System' \[8\] -
a Confucian model of governance and engagement order. As it is seen
today, President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [has taken]{.underline} all
[cudgels to see the]{.underline} 'China [Dream]{.underline}' take
visible shape and the country to gain the lost glory and emerge as a
world leader both in terms of material and global value system. China
monopolizes the global supply chains through block chain technology
under the carpet of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). \[9\] To materialize
China dream, President Jinping visualizes block chain as "an important
breakthrough" and [Beijing would "seize the opportunity"]{.underline}
\[10\] Moreover, **[it will "take the leading position \... occupy
the]{.underline}** commanding **[heights of innovation and gain new
industrial advantages]{.underline}**". \[11\] Quite parallel to this,
Professor Michael Sung- Chairman and founder of 'Carbon Blue
Innovations' has very optimistic view of Chinese Block Chain future.
Michael Sung envisages that "Chinese initiated Block chain-based
Services Network (BSN) will be the backbone infrastructure technology
for massive interconnectivity throughout the mainland, from city
governments to companies and individuals alike. \[12\] The network will
also form the backbone to the Digital Silk Road to provide
interconnectivity to all of China's trade partners around the globe.
Simultaneously it is anticipated that under the pretext of BSN, Beijing
is working towards dismantling of dollar as a global currency, trimming
down global technological reliance on the US. \[13\] Alarming
developments indeed! Global supply chains suddenly got disrupted in the
wake of COVID-19 pandemic. Restoration of supply chains is highly
necessary to augment growth and inject liquidity into the market. The
neo-liberal pundits opined that Block Chain Technology (BCT) would fill
the business vacuum in the post covid-19 period providing universal
access to information on the production, distribution and consumption
patterns in the public domains. At a moment, if agreed to those
opinions, it might accord a fresh lease of life to many of the battered
industries in the recession period. But the most debatable point is that
Beijing in the process has managed great command over BSN and its
gateway access as well. Hence, the question arises; would the economies
of Asia, Africa and Latin America have scope of universal and
transparent access to the BSN? Or they would succumb to the interests of
China and the Chinese corporate giants?

### Russia Alliance Links

#### NATO action means that China allies with Russia

**Kaczmarski 22** (Marcin Kaczmarski is a lecturer in Security Studies,
School of Social and Political Sciences, University of Glasgow. "The war
in Ukraine and the future of Russia-China relations," 4/28/22,
https://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1683#\_edn0)ZK

Russia's war against Ukraine has only reinforced the strategic,
political and normative dimensions of the Sino-Russian relationship.
[Beijing has benefitted from the US efforts and attention being
redirected from Asia-Pacific to Europe.]{.underline} The war has also
provided the Chinese leadership with unique lessons concerning the
conduct of war against a relatively well-equipped en- emy. It also
offered a way to study the Western reac- tion to the use of military
force, including the Western readiness to impose sanctions and the
difficulties to maintain unity over a longer period of time.
Politically, the Chinese government and state media have repeated and
amplified Russian narratives. [Bei- jing has accepted Russia's
justifications for the use of force, including **shifting the blame on
NATO** and the Alliance's enlargement process as well as condemn- ing
the US as completely responsible for the conflict]{.underline}. The
Chinese media and netizens have spread Russian conspiracy theories,
related for instance to alleged US biological laboratories in Ukraine.
Beijing has incurred certain reputational costs as the US and the EU ac-
cused China of tacitly supporting Russia -- this seems to be a
relatively low cost to China. The war offered Beijing the opportunity to
peddle the critique of US "hegemony" and portray itself as a neutral
third party.

#### Military Alliances against China and Russia only strengthen Putin-Xi relations

**BBC News 22** (2/4/22, "China joins Russia in opposing Nato
expansion," https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60257080)ZK

[[China has joined Russia in opposing further Nato
expansion]{.mark}]{.underline} as the two countries move closer together
in the face of Western pressure. Moscow and Beijing issued a statement
showcasing their agreement on a raft of issues during a visit by
Russia\'s Vladimir Putin for the Winter Olympics. Mr [Putin claims
Western powers are using the Nato defence alliance to undermine
Russia]{.underline}. It comes amid tensions over Ukraine, which he
denies planning to invade. Some 100,000 Russian troops remain at the
border with Ukraine, which is a former Soviet republic. Mr Putin, who
has written that Russians and Ukrainians are \"one nation\", has
demanded that Ukraine be barred from joining Nato. While the lengthy
joint statement did not refer directly to Ukraine, the two countries
accused Nato of espousing a Cold War ideology. The talks, which the
Kremlin said were \"very warm\", were held ahead of the Games opening
ceremony. It was the first time the leaders have met face-to-face since
the start of the pandemic. \"Friendship between \[Russia and China\] has
no limits, there are no \'forbidden\' areas of cooperation,\" the
statement reads. Security alliance [[The two countries]{.mark} said they
[were \"seriously concerned\" about the Aukus security
pact]{.mark}]{.underline} between the US, UK and Australia. Announced
last year, Aukus will see Australia build nuclear-powered submarines as
part of efforts to boost security in the Asia-Pacific region[. [It
is]{.underline}]{.mark} [largely seen as [an effort to counter
China]{.mark}, which has been accused of raising tensions in disputed
territories such as the South China Sea.]{.underline} Meanwhile [Russia
said it supported Beijing\'s One China policy]{.underline}, which
asserts that self-ruled Taiwan is a breakaway province that will
eventually be part of China again. However, Taiwan sees itself as an
independent country, with its own constitution and
democratically-elected leaders. They had lunch, they had talks then they
went off to see a show together - a big show. Vladimir Putin is the star
guest in Beijing for the start of the winter games. Of more significance
to [[this visit]{.underline}]{.mark} is the [[increased co-operation and
shared view of]{.mark} the world that Presidents [Xi and Putin]{.mark}
are keen to show]{.underline}. Although Ukraine wasn\'t mentioned it was
clearly hinted at when they both said they oppose the enlargement of the
Nato alliance. [For China this is a delicate balance]{.underline}.
[Beijing has relations with Ukraine - political and
economic.]{.underline} Any Russia invasion or military attack there
could be damaging for President Xi\'s standing. Amid a growing war of
words, the US on Wednesday accused Russia of planning to stage a fake
Ukrainian attack that it would use to justify an invasion. Russia denied
it was planning to fabricate an attack, and the US did not provide
evidence to support the claim.

#### No risk of a link turn -- Chinese distrust means that any NATO action is perceived poorly.

**Standish 22** (Reid Standish is an RFE/RL correspondent in Prague and
author of the China In Eurasia briefing. He focuses on Chinese foreign
policy in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. "China Takes Aim At NATO,"
5/11/22, https://www.rferl.org/a/china-nato-ukraine-war/31845030.html)ZK

[China]{.underline} increasingly [sees the war in Ukraine]{.underline}
\-- [and]{.underline} the roles of [the United States and its NATO
allies]{.underline} in backing Kyiv against Moscow \-- as a reflection
of future tensions to come between the military bloc and Beijing in the
Indo-Pacific. Ever since Russian tanks first crossed into Ukraine on
February 24, [Beijing has walked an awkward line between not giving
outright support to Moscow\'s invasion while accusing the United States
and other NATO countries of provoking the war by allowing the security
alliance to expand eastward despite protests from the
Kremlin.]{.underline} Now, as the war continues to grind on with the
Russian military suffering major setbacks on the battlefield, China has
ramped up its rhetoric to warn about NATO and the United States\'
footprint in Asia. \"[NATO]{.underline}, a military organization in the
North Atlantic, [has in recent years come to the Asia-Pacific region
to]{.underline} throw its weight around and [stir up
conflicts,\"]{.underline} Wang [Wenbin, a Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman, said]{.underline} in late April. \"NATO has messed up Europe.
Is it now trying to mess up the Asia-Pacific and even the world?\"
[Wang\'s comments were in response to]{.underline} earlier [remarks from
U.K. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who called for **boosting NATO** in
the wake of the Ukraine war]{.underline} and warned China that it should
\"play by the rules.\" The added focus on NATO from Beijing comes as
both China and the United States see Russia\'s invasion as a foil for
future tensions between the two countries in Asia. NATO said last year
that it intended to focus more on China and Beijing is expected to play
a large role in the bloc\'s strategy moving forward. Likewise,
Washington is increasingly convinced that the conflict provides it with
an unexpected advantage in the long term, with Bloomberg reporting on
May 10 that U.S. officials believe that bolstered European defense
spending and a weakened Russia could allow it to accelerate a security
shift toward China. [Those aims are part of th]{.underline}e [**shared
distrust toward NATO and the United States** that has led Beijing and
Moscow to become closer in recent]{.underline} years [and]{.underline}
why many analysts believe that [China has not abandoned
Russia]{.underline} throughout its brutal war in Ukraine. Similarly,
experts and Western officials warn that Beijing is closely watching the
response to Russia\'s invasion and drawing potential lessons for any
tensions over Taiwan, which China claims as its territory and has
threatened to invade if Taipei refuses to submit to its control. People
watch a TV broadcasting the news of Russian troops launching their
attack on Ukraine at a restaurant in Hong Kong on February 24. \"If
China joins the West in condemning Russia, it will be much applauded in
Washington and most European capitals. But it will lose Russia\'s
partnership,\" Senior Colonel Zhou Bo, a retired officer of China\'s
People\'s Liberation Army (PLA), wrote in The Economist on May 9. \"And
it is only a matter of time before America takes on China again. The
Biden administration\'s policy towards my country is \'extreme
competition\' that stops just short of war.\" Ukraine War As a
\'Mirror\' The parallels drawn between U.S. strategy in the Indo-Pacific
and NATO\'s expansion in Europe are not new, with both China and Russia
underlining this point in the 5,000-word joint statement they released
in February when Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian counterpart
Vladimir Putin declared a \"no-limits\" partnership. The document voiced
their opposition to the \"further enlargement of NATO\" and pledged to
\"remain highly vigilant about the negative impact of the United
States\' Indo-Pacific strategy.\" Despite Chinese protests, experts
point out there are key differences between NATO\'s role and U.S.
strategy in the Indo-Pacific region, which also includes a wider range
of economic and political policies beyond the bloc and the United States
dealing with its long Pacific Ocean border. Still, the Ukraine war is
set to affect the region, with Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Le
Yucheng saying in March that the crisis could be used as a \"mirror\" to
view the security situation in the Asia-Pacific region. For the
administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, the move toward Asia is seen
as critical and long overdue. Washington has increasingly warned about
China abusing its military and economic clout in the region, pointing to
the country\'s moves to exert greater control over Hong Kong, expand its
military presence in the South China Sea, and crack down on human rights
in Xinjiang Province, which has seen more than 1 million Uyghurs,
Kazakhs, and other Muslim minorities interned in camps. But while both
U.S. and Chinese officials see parallels between the Ukraine war and
rising tensions in Asia, they are each drawing different lessons. U.S.
officials continue to view increased defense spending in Europe, as well
as both Finland and Sweden on an immediate path toward NATO membership,
as positive security developments that could allow the United States to
follow through on its long-delayed \"pivot to Asia.\" That policy was
first outlined by U.S. President Barack Obama and the move is seen as
necessary as U.S. policy circles increasingly view China, not Russia, as
the country\'s main military adversary. Chinese officials and experts,
however, are reaching different conclusions from the reflections they
see in Ukraine. [Beijing \-- and Xi in particular \-- has long supported
\"strategic autonomy,\"]{.underline} a concept pushed by French
President Emmanuel Macron that calls for Europe to play a more
independent role in its defense that relies less on the United States.
In a May 10 call with Macron, Xi pushed the French president and other
European leaders to take security \"into their own hands,\" echoing
earlier comments from a May 9 call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
While the long-term implications of the Ukraine war are still uncertain,
as is the future of European \"strategic autonomy,\" Beijing
increasingly seems to believe that it could further delay the U.S.
strategic pivot to China and lead to a lasting division among European
and NATO allies. \"Joe Biden had hoped to put Russia policy on a
\'stable and predictable\' footing in order to focus on America\'s
Indo-Pacific strategy. The war in Ukraine undoubtedly will distract
America\'s attention and \[siphon\] away resources,\" wrote Zhou, the
retired PLA officer. \"The question is\...how long Mr. Biden will allow
Ukraine to remain a distraction.\"

### Hege Causes Russia Alliance

#### Pursuit of hege causes Russia-China alliance. 

**Feng 15** (Huiyi, Senior Researcher at the Danish Institute for
International Studies, "WILL CHINA AND RUSSIA FORM AN ALLIANCE AGAINST

KM

Despite divergent economic and strategic interests, the rapid
development of bilateral relations in the second decade of the 2000s is
remarkable. [The "full partnership" between the two states is primarily
driven by the perception of common threat from the United
States.]{.underline} The common threat and economic interests have
mutually reinforced the strengthening of bilateral relations between the
two nations. [[Will this "full partnership" become a formal military
alliance against the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, or
challenge the Western order in the future[? The answer is: **[it depends
on what the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [does]{.mark}.** Right now,
the "full partnership" between the two powers is at best a "soft
balancing" strategy against the United States. However, [if the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [continuously pushes]{.mark}]{.underline}
Russia through NATO and [[China]{.mark} through its "rebalancing" in the
Asia Pacific, [it will certainly drive Russia and China to move closer
to each other. The deepening]{.mark}]{.underline} economic and security
[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} between the two [[will]{.mark} not
only serve to beef up their military capabilities, but it might also
[create a military platform for alliance formation.]{.mark} When US
threats towards both countries reach a certain point, a Sino-Russian
alliance could become a harsh reality for the United States and the
Western order.]{.underline} Russia's arms trade with China is not all
about money. It is by no means easy for China and Russia to move to a
military alliance. Their bitter history may preclude them from trying,
because of what they had experienced during the Cold War. [In the new
geopolitical game, in which the United States, at least for the time
being, remains hegemon, the US actually holds the first-move advantage
to determine how the game will play out.]{.underline} It is natural for
the hegemon to try hard to preserve its hegemonic position. Moreover, as
Quansheng Zhao (2007) points out, the rise of China does not necessarily
mean the decline of the United States and the "managed great power
relations" between the United States and China might lead to a peaceful
power transition in the 21st century. Nevertheless, [if the United
States tries to take both Russia and China down simultaneously in the
game, it might produce a self-ful lling prophecy: that successful [soft
balancing by the Sino-Russian partnership will accelerate US decline
instead of **safeguarding US hegemony**. US
policymakers]{.mark}]{.underline} and European leaders [[should
therefore]{.mark} reflect on their policies toward China and
Russia.]{.underline} Why can two former enemies move so close despite
their previous huge ideological, material and ideational differences?
[It is time for the United States]{.underline} and European countries to
consider how [to [reset their relations with China]{.mark}]{.underline}
and Russia before it is too late. China and Russia will also need to be
cautious in testing the red lines of the US and the West in general.
Even though a Chinese-Russian alliance is formidable, the differences
between the two major powers are obvious, and the areas of possible
frictions are ever-mounting. Neither has the intention to sever
completely their relationship with the West, particularly with the US,
nor to sacrifice their Western link for the sake of the alliance.

#### Pursuit of hegemony is unsustainable and motivates a Sino-Russian coalition --- causes fiscal and military overstretch, domestic polarization, and global war*.*

**[[Even the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[cannot]{.mark} prudently [take
on]{.mark} **every adversary** on **[multiple
fronts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The costs of **military campaigns**
against these adversaries]{.underline} in their backyards, [whether in
the **Baltic States** or **Taiwan**]{.underline}, [would **outstrip the
losses** that the U.S. military has sustained in
**decades**]{.underline}. Short of all-out conflict, [[to **mobilize for
dominance** and risk **escalation**]{.mark} on multiple such fronts
would court **several dangers**]{.underline}. [It [would **overstretch
the country**. The]{.mark} U.S. [defense budget]{.mark} now [approaches
**\$800 billion**]{.mark} **annually**]{.underline}, not including
deficit-financed military operations. [This is a time of **ballooning
deficits**]{.underline}, where the Congressional Budget Office warns
that "[the prospect of **large** and [**growing debt** poses
**substantial risks**]{.mark} for the nation]{.underline}." If in such
conditions, [**current expenditure** is **not enough** to buy
[**unchallengeable military preponderance**]{.mark}]{.underline}---and
it may not be---then the failure lies not in the failure to spend even
more.

Neither is the answer to sacrifice the quality of civic life at home to
service the cause of preponderance abroad. [The old "two war standard,"
a planning construct whereby the United States configures its forces to
conduct two regional conflicts at once, [would be **unsustainably
demanding**]{.mark}]{.underline} against more than one peer competitor,
or potentially with a roster of major and minor adversaries all at
once.28 After all, the purpose of American military power is ultimately
to secure a way of life as a constitutional republic. To impose
ever-greater debts on civil society and strip back collective provision
at home, on the basis that the quality of life is expendable for the
cause of hegemony, is perversely to set up power-projection abroad as
the end, when it should be the means. [[The problem
lies]{.underline},]{.mark} rather, [[in the]{.mark} **inflexible
[pursuit of hegemony]{.mark} itself**, and the failure to **balance
commitments** with **scarce resources.**]{.underline}

[[To attempt to suppress **every adversary** ]{.mark}**simultaneously**
[would **drive adversaries together**, creating **hostile
coalitions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It also may not succeed.
**[Counterproliferation]{.underline}** in North Korea is difficult
enough, for instance, but the task [becomes more difficult still if U.S.
enmity with China drives Beijing to **refuse cooperation**]{.underline}
over enforcing sanctions on Pyongyang. [Concurrent competitions would
also split **American resources**]{.underline}, attention and time.
[**Exacerbating** [the **strain** on **scarce resources**]{.mark}
between **defense, consumption** and **investment** raises the
**polarizing question** of whether preponderance is **even worth it,**
which then **undermines the domestic** **consensus** needed to
**support** it]{.underline}. At the same time, [reduced investment in
infrastructure and education [**would** damage the **economic
foundations** for]{.mark} **conducting [competition]{.mark} abroad** in
the **first place.**]{.underline}

Taken together, [[**indiscriminate competition** risks creating]{.mark}
the thing **most feared** in traditional U.S. grand strategy[: a
**hostile Eurasian alliance**]{.mark} leading to **continuous U.S.
mobilization** against **hostile coalitions**]{.underline}, turning the
U.S. republic into an illiberal garrison state. [If the prospect for the
United States as a great power faces a problem, it is not the **size of
the defense budget**, or]{.underline} the material weight of
[**resources** at the U.S. disposal, or **popular reluctance to exercise
leadership**]{.underline}. [**Rather**, the problem lies in the **scope
of the policy** that those capabilities are **designed to
serve**]{.underline}. To make the problem smaller, Washington should
take steps to make the pool of adversaries smaller.

### Sanctions Module

#### China is treading the line on helping Russia with sanctions now but still has not done anything

**Arab News 6/1** ("China's Russia dealings irk US, but don't breach
sanctions" ,6/1/22, https://www.arabnews.com/node/2094126/world)ZK

BEIJING: [China's support for Russia]{.underline} through oil and gas
purchases [is irking Washington]{.underline} and raising the risk of US
retaliation, foreign observers say[, though]{.underline} they see **[no
sign]{.underline}** [Beijing is helping Moscow evade sanctions over its
war on Ukraine]{.underline}. Beijing's importance as a lifeline to
Russian President Vladimir Putin rose Monday after the 27-nation
European Union, the main market for fossil fuels that supply most of
Moscow's foreign income, agreed to stop oil purchases. President Xi
Jinping's government declared ahead of Russia's Feb. 24 attack that it
had a "no limits" friendship with Moscow and has kept the West guessing
about whether it might bail Putin out. [China rejects the sanctions as
illegal because the United States, Europe and Japan cut off Russia from
their markets and the global banking system]{.underline} without working
through the United Nations, where Beijing and Moscow have veto power.
[The sanctions don't prohibit China, India or other countries from
buying Russian oil and gas.]{.underline} But President Joe Biden has
warned Xi of unspecified consequences if Beijing helps Moscow evade
sanctions. That leaves open the risk Chinese companies might be punished
by losing access to valuable Western markets. **[Beijing appears to be
complying]{.underline}**. But state-owned companies are buying more
Russian oil and gas, which gives the Kremlin export income. They also
are potential investors in Russian energy projects as Western companies
leave. "The Biden administration will likely become increasingly
exasperated at China's continued support for Russia," Neil Thomas of
Eurasia Group said in an email. That increases the likelihood of
"unilateral moves to punish Beijing" and "allied coordination on
economic security measures aimed at countering China," Thomas said. The
conflict adds to tension with Washington over Taiwan, Hong Kong, human
rights, trade, technology and Beijing's strategic ambitions. China poses
the "most serious long-term challenge to the international order,"
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a May 26 speech. Xi's
government has tried to distance itself from Putin's war by calling for
peace talks, but it avoids criticizing Moscow. Other governments "must
not harm China's legitimate interests in any way" in dealing with
Ukraine, warned a foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian. Monday's
decision by EU leaders will cut imports of Russian oil by 90 percent,
according to the head of its executive branch, Ursula von der Leyen.
European customers have been paying Russia as much as \$1 billion per
day for oil, gas and coal. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's permanent
representative to international organizations in Vienna, responded on
Twitter: "Russia will find other importers." Moscow is tiny as a trading
partner for Beijing but an ally against what both resent as US dominance
in global affairs. China sees Russian oil and gas as a way to diversify
supplies for its energy-hungry economy. China bought 20 percent of last
year's Russian crude exports, according to the International Energy
Agency. The two sides announced a new 30-year gas contract on Feb. 4,
three weeks ahead of Moscow's attack on Ukraine, that the state
newspaper Global Times said will increase annual supplies to China by
about 25 percent. While the two are friendly, [China]{.underline} is
taking advantage of the situation to get cheaper energy and favorable
business deals, said Maria Shagina of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies. "They would always capitalize on Russia's isolation,"
said Shagina. "But they [would be very cautious not to violate sanctions
outright]{.underline}." On May 24, while Biden was visiting Tokyo,
Russian and Chinese warplanes carried out "strategic air patrols" above
the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea and the western Pacific. The
Japanese government said bombers flew near Japan. Biden warned Xi during
a March 18 video meeting not to give Moscow military or economic aid.
Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in March that
Washington wouldn't tolerate China or any other country helping Moscow
work around sanctions. The White House has criticized Beijing's
"rhetorical support" for Putin. [Washington is "monitoring closely"
Chinese dealings with Moscow,]{.underline} the American Embassy said in
a written response to questions. "[We have not seen the provision of
military equipment,"]{.underline} it said. Asked about economic
sanctions and possible violations, the embassy said it had nothing
further. After BP and ExxonMobil announced they were pulling out of
Russian oil and gas projects, "there are rumors state-owned Chinese
companies might step in and acquire stakes," said Shagina. China's
imports from Russia rose 56.6 percent over a year earlier in April to
\$8.9 billion, according to customs data. That helped Putin's government
record a current account surplus, the broadest measure of trade, of \$96
billion for the four months ending in April. Washington also is
frustrated that India, the No. 3 global oil importer, is buying more
from Russia to take advantage of low prices. The Biden administration is
lobbying Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to stop. In March,
the US government told Asian and European allies that American
intelligence had determined China indicated to Russia it would be
willing to provide military support for the campaign in Ukraine and
financial help to limit the impact of sanctions. Russia has been
expelled from the global SWIFT network for bank transfers. China's
credit card processor, UnionPay, refused to work with Russian banks
after Visa and MasterCard stopped serving them, the Russian news outlet
RBC reported in April. It said UnionPay worried it might be hit by
"secondary sanctions" and cut off from the Western-controlled global
financial system. China gave Moscow an economic lifeline following
Western sanctions imposed over its 2014 seizure of Crimea from Ukraine.
Beijing agreed to buy Russian gas in a deal estimated to be worth up to
\$400 billion over three decades. Moscow turned to Chinese state-owned
companies to help pay for oil and gas development after Crimea-related
sanctions cut off Western financing. "The help will never come for
free," Shagina said.

#### China could successfully bail out Russia, but they don't want to be economically isolated.

**Ren 22** (Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian
markets. "Why China Won't Help Russia Around Sanctions," 3/8/22,
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-03-08/why-china-won-t-help-russia-around-sanctions)ZK

[China]{.underline} is the wild card. President Xi Jinping has vowed
that the friendship between China and Russia has "no limits," and he
certainly [has the tools to help soften the blow of unprecedented
sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European Union on]{.underline}
Vladimir [Putin]{.underline}'s wartime economy. [Beijing could buy some
of Russia's \$130 billion hoard of gold held by the Russian central bank
and pay for it in U.S. dollars.]{.underline} It could reactivate a
currency swap line, which was established after Russia's annexation of
Crimea in 2014, and serve as the lender of the last resort. It could
also step up trade with Russia, buying more oil, natural gas, wheat and
fertilizers. [Even better, China could buy stakes in Russian energy and
commodities companies]{.underline} --- although such deliberations are
at an early stage, according to Bloomberg News. [Plus, China has a long
history of working around U.S. sanctions.]{.underline} In the past, it
has used small, systemically unimportant banks to do business with Iran.
**[But]{.underline}** [provoking leaders of its two dominant markets is
the last thing China needs right now.]{.underline} [With its property
industry slumping and small businesses suffocating]{.underline} from a
strict zero Covid policy, resilient international sales are perhaps the
economy's saving grace. [China doesn't want to alienate the U.S. and the
European Union, which together account for about 35% of its
exports]{.underline}, especially if it still aims to reach its ambitious
5.5% growth target. The math won't work. Real estate, which represents
about a quarter of the economy, has extended its nosedive into a second
year. Last month, home sales of the largest 100 developers slumped 47.2%
from a year ago, more than January's 39.6% decline. New construction
starts were down 33% in December, the latest data available. A 1
percentage point decline in real-estate investment will reduce China's
GDP growth by 0.13 percentage points, even as policy makers step up
counter-cyclical support, estimates Bloomberg Economics' David Qu. As
the National People's Congress convenes this week, Premier Li Keqiang
took pains to lay out in his annual work report the steps the government
is taking to help businesses. This year, tax cuts and rebates, which
prioritize small and medium enterprises and manufacturers, will amount
to 2.5 trillion yuan (\$400 billion), more than doubling last year's
cuts. The largesse reflects the government's own nod that its zero
tolerance to Covid is hurting private enterprises. Retail sales growth
was practically flat in December, while catering services, dominated by
small business, fell from a year ago, according to the latest data. A
recent survey of small businesses showed that average sales were at only
30.6% of the pre-pandemic level, and their cash pile could run out in
less than three months if there was no incoming revenue. As China
confronts its worst outbreak since the early days of the pandemic, the
road to economic recovery remains long and winding. Meanwhile, China is
churning out a record 10.8 million university graduates this year, and
they'll need jobs. But crackdowns last year on Big Tech and real estate
cut off prized career paths. New job postings in the real estate sector
fell 29% from a year ago, while roughly half of those working for
internet companies said their employers have been laying off staff,
according to a survey by Zhaopin, an online job recruiter. The
government is keeping its urban unemployment target of no more than 5.5%
unchanged this year. [What's left is exports]{.underline}. During the
pandemic, China benefited tremendously from the world's demand for
masks, medical supplies and work-from-home equipment, such as computers
and keyboards. [In December, exports soared to a record high of \$340
billion. Would China risk turning off the U.S. and Europe to give Putin
a hand?]{.underline} Granted, Xi's friendship with Putin may be genuine
--- they share the world view that expanding Western influence and the
U.S. are their top mutual antagonists. But putting that view into
practice on behalf of an ally who invaded its neighbor risks undermining
Xi's top priority: stability, a key phrase emphasized at this week's
Congress meetings. Starting a war that sends the price of oil soaring
above \$125 a barrel does not promote stability. By attacking Ukraine,
Russia is piling a potential energy crisis onto a friend that is still
trying to defuse a financial time bomb started by its ambitious and
distressed property builders. [No matter how "rock solid" Beijing claims
the relationship to be, China isn't likely to come to Putin's
aid.]{.underline}

## Impacts

### 2nc -- Diversionary Impact

#### Even if China's economy doesn't completely collapse, slowing growth causes. Xi to launch a diversionary war to regain domestic support -- escalates in multiple hotspots 

**Norris 17**, William J. Geostrategic Implications of China's Twin
Economic Challenges. CFR Discussion Paper, 2017. (Associate professor of
Chinese foreign and security policy at Texas A&M University's Bush
School of Government and Public Service)//Elmer

[Populist pressures might tempt the **party leadership** to encourage
**diversionary nationalism**.]{.underline} The logic of this concern is
straightforward: the [Communist Party might seek to **distract a
restless domestic population** with **adventurism
abroad**.]{.underline}19 The **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}**
administration [[wants to **appear tough** in]{.mark} its **[defense of
foreign encroachments]{.mark}** against China's interests.]{.underline}
This need stems from a long-running narrative about how a weak Qing
dynasty was unable to defend China in the face of European imperial
expansion, epitomized by the Opium Wars and the subsequent treaties
imposed on China in the nineteenth century. [The [party is]{.mark}
**particularly [sensitive]{.mark}** [to **perceptions of weakness**
because]{.mark} much of its **[claim to
legitimacy]{.mark}**---manifested in **Xi's Chinese Dream** campaign
today---[stems from]{.mark} the party's claims of leading the
[**restoration of Chinese greatness**.]{.mark}]{.underline} For example,
the May Fourth Movement, a popular protest in 1919 that helped catalyze
the CPC, called into question the legitimacy of the Republic of China
government running the country at that time because the regime was seen
as not having effectively defended China's territorial and sovereignty
interests at the Versailles Peace Conference. [**Diversionary
nationalist frictions** would likely occur if the Chinese leadership
portrayed a foreign adversary as having made the first
move]{.underline}, thus [forcing Xi to stand up for China's
interests.]{.underline} An example is the 2012 attempt by the
nationalist governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, to buy the
Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands from a private owner.20 Although the Japanese
central government sought to avert a crisis by stepping in to purchase
the islands---having them bought and administered by Ishihara's Tokyo
metropolitan government would have dragged Japan into a confrontation
with China---China saw this move as part of a deliberate orchestration
by Japan to nationalize the islands. Xi seemingly had no choice but to
defend China's claims against an attempt by Japan to consolidate its
position on the dispute.21 This issue touched off a period of heated
tensions between China and Japan, lasting more than two years.22 Such
dynamics are not limited to Japan. Other [possible [areas of conflict
include]{.mark}]{.underline}, but are not necessarily limited to,
[[**Taiwan**, **India**, and the **S**]{.mark}**outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea** (especially [with the **Philippines** and
**Vietnam**]{.mark}).]{.underline} The Chinese government will use such
tactics if it believes that the costs are relatively low. Ideally, China
would like to appear tough while avoiding material repercussions or a
serious diplomatic breakdown. Standing up against foreign
encroachment---without facing much blowback---could provide Xi's
administration with a tempting source of noneconomic legitimacy.
However, over the next few years, Xi will probably not be actively
looking to get embroiled abroad. Cushioning the fallout from slower
growth while managing a structural economic transition will be difficult
enough. Courting potential international crises that distract the
central leadership would make this task even more daunting. [Even if the
top leadership did not wish to provoke conflict, a smaller budgetary
allotment for security could cause **[military interests]{.mark}** in
China to [**deliberately instigate trouble** to **justify**]{.mark}
their **[claims over]{.mark} increasingly scarce
[resources]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} For example, an air force
interested in ensuring its funding for a midair tanker program might
find the existence of far-flung territorial disputes to be useful in
making its case. Such a case would be made even stronger by a pattern of
recent frictions that highlights the necessity of greater air power
projection. Budgetary pressures may be partly behind a recent People's
Liberation Army reorganization and headcount reduction. A slowing
economy might cause a further deceleration in China's military spending,
thus increasing such pressures as budgetary belts tighten. Challenges to
Xi's Leadership Xi Jinping's efforts to address economic challenges
could fail, unleashing consequences that extend well beyond China's
economic health. For example, [an **economic collapse** could give rise
to a Vladimir **Putin--like redemption figure** in China. [Xi's]{.mark}
approach of [centralizing authority]{.mark} over]{.underline} a diverse,
complex, and massive social, political, and [economic system [is a
**recipe for brittleness**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Rather than designing a
resilient, decentralized governance structure that can gracefully cope
with localized failures at particular nodes in a network, [a highly
centralized architecture **risks catastrophic**, **system-level
failure**.]{.underline} Although centralized authority offers the
tantalizing chimera of stronger control from the center, it also puts
all the responsibility squarely on Xi's shoulders. With China's
ascension to great power status, the consequences of internecine
domestic political battles are increasingly playing out on the world
stage. The [international significance of China's domestic politics is a
new paradigm for the Chinese leadership]{.underline}, and one can expect
an adjustment period during which the outcome of what had previously
been relatively insulated [domestic political frictions will likely
generate **unintended international repercussions**.]{.underline} Such
dynamics will influence Chinese foreign policy and security behavior.
[Domestic arguments over ideology, bureaucratic power struggles, and
strategic direction could all have **ripple effects
abroad**.]{.underline} Many of China's party heavyweights still employ a
narrow and exclusively domestic political calculus. [Such behavior
increases the possibility of international implications that are not
fully anticipated, **raising the risks** of **strategic
[miscalc]{.mark}ulation** on the world stage.]{.underline} For example,
the factional power struggles that animated the Cultural Revolution were
largely driven by domestic concerns, yet manifested themselves in
Chinese foreign policy for more than a decade. During this period, China
was not the world's second largest economy and, for much of this time,
did not even have formal representation at the United Nations[.
[If]{.mark} today's globally interconnected [China became engulfed
in]{.mark} similar [domestic chaos,]{.mark} the effects would be felt
worldwide.23 Weakened Fetters of Economic Interdependence If China
successfully transitioned away from its export-driven growth model
toward a consumption-driven economic engine over the next four or five
years, it could no longer feel as constrained by economic
interdependence. To the extent that such constraints are loosened, [the
U.S.-China relationship will be more prone to conflict]{.mark} and
friction]{.underline}.24 While China has never been the archetypal
liberal economic power bent on benign integration with the global
economy, its export-driven growth model produced a strong strategic
preference for stability. Although past behavior is not necessarily
indicative of future strategic calculus, China's "economic circuit
breaker" logic seems to have held its most aggressive nationalism below
the threshold of war since 1979. A China that is both comparatively
strong and less dependent on the global economy would be a novel
development in modern geopolitics. As China changes the composition of
its international economic linkages, global integration could place
fewer constraints on it. Whereas China has been highly reliant on the
import of raw materials and semifinished goods for reexport, a
consumption-driven China could have a different international trade
profile. China could still rely on imported goods, but their centrality
to the country's overall economic growth would be altered. Imports of
luxury goods, consumer products, international brands, and services may
not exert a significant constraining influence, since loss of access to
such items may not be seen as strategically vital. If these flows were
interrupted or jeopardized, the result would be more akin to an
inconvenience than a strategic setback for China's rise. That said,
China is likely to continue to highly depend on imported oil even if the
economic end to which that energy resource is directed shifts away from
industrial and export production toward domestic consumption.

### Econ Impact -- Diversionary War 

#### Chinese slow growth causes SCS conflict -- rally around the flag effect

China's Growth Slowdown", World Affairs Council of Western Michigan,

bjs

[The once extraordinary rate of Chinese economic growth is
slowing.]{.underline} In 2014, China's GDP grew at an official rate of
7.4 percent, slightly less than the stated goal of 7.5 percent. Although
more recently monthly data have been more robust, the trend towards
slowing growth seems inexorable. [A decelerating Chinese economy, coming
at a time of global economic uncertainty]{.underline} (especially in the
eurozone), [**could have dramatic economic implications throughout the
world**.]{.underline} However, [the repercussions of a Chinese economic
slowdown would not be limited to the economic sphere. Given the
incredible importance of economic growth to political stability -- both
within China itself and East Asia in general]{.underline} -- [**adapting
to a dampened Chinese economy will be a pivotal challenge in the
Asia-Pacific.**]{.underline} While an official GDP growth rate of 7.4
percent would be the envy of most major economies, this figure
represents China's lowest economic growth since 1991. And of course,
economic data from China's National Bureau of Statistics is not
completely trusted by all observers. Local officials (and the central
government itself) have a vested interest in exaggerating their economic
performance. Capital Economics, a London-based research group, monitors
the Chinese economy by looking at the five factors of electricity
output, freight shipmen, construction, passenger travel, and cargo
volume. According to this China Activity Proxy, recent annual growth is
closer to 5.7 percent. Regardless of the statistical specifics of the
Chinese slowdown, [this development poses some degree of political risk
for the Chinese state. For more than two decades economic growth has
been the major factor in ensuring political stability in
China]{.underline}. Many Westerners forget that the massive protests
that rocked Beijing and other Chinese cities in 1989 coincided with the
biggest economic crisis of the post-Mao era, with annual inflation of 30
percent leading to panic buying throughout the country. Since 1990,
China has been governed by a social contract in which the material lives
of ordinary citizens improve dramatically while the Party keeps a
monopoly on political power. [Rising wages and standards of living
helped ensure political stability]{.underline}. [Historically most
revolutions]{.underline}, including the recent upheavals in the Middle
East, [only reached critical mass when a majority of a country's people
lost hope in the economic capabilities of the governing political
structure. Recent initiatives by the Chinese state can be understood in
light of these economic concerns.]{.underline} [Since coming in to power
in 2013]{.underline}, the administration of President [Xi]{.underline}
Jinping [has launched several populist measures]{.underline}. Posters
throughout the country combine traditional Chinese themes with Communist
Party slogans to promote the "Chinese Dream." Xi's campaigns against
lavish banquets and other government waste led to a significant drop in
the price of high-end liquor soon after his rise to power. [Perhaps most
important has been a massive anti-corruption campaign,]{.underline}
which has netted thousands of corrupt officials, from minor bureaucrats
to the massively powerful former head of internal security. The
anti-corruption campaign in China has been so far-reaching that it is
now having negative effects on the Chinese economy. These effects create
something of a contradiction in the Chinese polity, because although the
anti-corruption campaign enjoys widespread support, it appears to be
having some detrimental effects on the main economic pillar of Chinese
political stability. Besides dampening the high-end liquor market, the
anti-graft and ant-waste campaigns have had deleterious effects on
industries from tourism and gambling to real estate. Mao Daqing, deputy
chief executive officer of the largest property developer in China,
openly warned ofthe economic impacts of the political campaign: "For us
developers, the impact of the anti-corruption campaign on the sales of
high-end property is very serious." China's once-booming housing market
is now deflating, with prices falling in a majority of cities. Prices
appear to be dropping because the rapid increase in housing supply in
recent years has outstripped demand. Problems in the real estate market
are mirrored by other macroeconomic troubles. Much of the low-hanging
economic fruit in China has been plucked. Rising wages in China have led
many manufacturers to relocate to countries such as Vietnam or the
Philippines. China's historically strong international trade is also
taking a hit, with exports down 3.3 percent from a year ago and imports
dropping nearly 20 percent. In June 2014, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang
pledged to maintain a robust growth rate: "China's economy needs to grow
at a proper rate, expected to be around 7.5 per cent this year...
Despite considerable downward pressure, China's economy is moving on a
steady course. We will continue to make anticipatory and moderate
adjustments when necessary. We are well prepared to defuse various
risks." Indeed, since this pledge and the subsequent slowdown, the
central government has used macroeconomic tools to boost growth. The
People's Bank of China cut interest rates in November, and more recently
lowered the reserve requirement ratio, freeing up \$100 billion for
lending. China has weathered previous economic predicaments, for example
the 2008 global financial crisis, and emerged stronger. A hard landing
is by no means a foregone conclusion, and China still has many
macroeconomic advantages. However, for all the policy tools at Beijing's
disposal, China's leaders cannot guarantee rapid economic growth
forever. It may be necessary to lower economic expectations, while
shoring up the state's popular legitimacy through non-economic means.
Back in 2013, Xi criticized the myopic focus on economic growth, saying
"We should never judge a cadre simply by the growth of gross domestic
product." More recently an article in China's NetEase quoted Fudan
University Department of Finance professor Kong Aiguo as saying, "Since
we are entering what is called the 'new normal', we should not worry
about the speed of GDP, bur rather we should focus on livelihood issues,
public welfare issues, entrepreneurship issues, and financial
transparency issues." [Adapting to China's "new normal" of lowered GDP
growth will be an important challenge for leaders in China and around
the world]{.underline}. China does more international trade than any
other country on earth. Besides issues of trade, any problems in the
Chinese financial system could have serious global impacts, especially
coming at a time of relative global economic uncertainty. [If China does
face a prolonged period of economic difficulty, the political
repercussions could be volatile. **The Chinese state might be forced to
look for alternative sources of popular support**.]{.underline} China's
leaders could implement additional populist measures[. It is also
possible that increased nationalism could come in to play, **especially
in the unresolved territorial disputes in the East China Sea and the
South China Sea. Regional and global powers would be wise to monitor
China's economic situation closely.**]{.underline}

#### Yes diversionary wars \-\-- nationalism \-\-- they escalate

**Morimoto, 14** - The Chicago Council on Global Affairs \[Andy, "Can
China Fall Peacefully?" November 19, 2014
http://nationalinterest.org/feature/can-china-fall-peacefully-11703?page=show\]

Which brings us to our second theory---one that I believe is more likely
to materialize. This theory posits that [an economic downturn in China
will cause a crisis in legitimacy for the Chinese Communist Party, who
will in turn point to external threats to bolster its internal
legitimacy. China's leaders]{.underline}, in other words, [will play the
nationalism card]{.underline}, perhaps provoking an international
conflagration in one or more of the aforementioned flashpoints.

We've seen this movie before. Following World War II, the Chinese
economy was in shambles, yet China's leadership did not turn inward, but
rather to the Korean peninsula. Similarly, during the economic
catastrophe that was the Cultural Revolution, China's leaders turned to
Vietnam. Zhang Lifan, a Chinese historian, explains that "historically,
during every period with many deep conflicts within the country, there
has been a surge of anti-foreign sentiments from the party." Things are
no different today.

[This year alone, China's state-run newspaper]{.underline}, The People's
Daily, [published forty-two articles blaming China's domestic problems
on foreign forces]{.underline}. Even in the midst of this month's APEC
meeting (which is typically a golden opportunity to show off diplomatic
credentials and feign bridge-building enthusiasm), President [Xi Jinping
publicly praised a young blogger who is now famous for his nationalistic
writings---some of which border on xenophobia.]{.underline}

**[Chinese leaders won't be able to easily turn off the nationalist
anger that is created]{.underline}**. And [if China's economy does
indeed sink]{.underline}, **[we should expect more of this strident
nationalism]{.underline}**, not less. Unfortunately, [it isn't hard to
picture a scenario in which a nationalist fervor sweeps across China,
leading to **escalation, miscalculation or an accidental
conflict.**]{.underline}

#### Economic decline causes diversionary tactics and aggression

**Browne, 16**---Senior Correspondent and Columnist, The Wall Street
Journal \[Andrew, "China puts nationalism into play amid market chaos"

http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/china-puts-nationalism-into-play-amid-market-chaos/news-story/26491e3f09f53f5ce0c59baef54b79da\]

[Expect more nationalist distractions as China's economy enters what
many experts now believe will be a slow and painful
decline.]{.underline}

[Not all are likely to be so charmingly disguised]{.underline} --- or
end as uneventfully. After a few hours on the ground, the aircraft
operated by Hainan Airlines and China Southern Airlines lifted off and
headed home.

Regional strategists, meanwhile, worry that [job losses and escalating
worker protests may encourage Chinese **leaders to launch new overseas
adventures, confronting America more aggressively and intimidating
neighbours**]{.underline} [already alarmed by what they see as Beijing's
expansionist ambitions.]{.underline}

Hanoi protested a flurry of recent flights into airspace it supervises,
including those to the reefs on the disputed Spratly Islands, as "a
serious violation of Vietnam's sovereignty." [A US State Department
spokeswoman accused China of exacerbating tensions in a critical
maritime thoroughfare]{.underline}. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman
on Monday defended the flights and said the suggestion they affected
regional safety "doesn't hold water."

Still, [China is ramping up its military capabilities even as the
world's second-largest economy stumbles]{.underline}. A few days before
the test flights, a Defense Ministry spokesman confirmed that Beijing
was building a second aircraft carrier based on its own designs. It
acquired its first, a Soviet hand-me-down, from Ukraine.

That revelation followed the announcement in November that China plans
to open its first overseas military facility in the East African nation
of Djibouti.

[Redirecting popular frustrations through muscular nationalism is a
tried and tested strategy for Chinese leaders]{.underline}: It rescued
the Communist Party from a near-death experience after the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre. Current economic challenges aren't as
threatening, although the stock market sell-off on top of record capital
flight underscores a challenge that could, over time, erode the party's
legitimacy.

Most likely, say many economists, [China's economy will undershoot its
growth target for this year, expected to be 6.5%. That would leave the
Chinese leadership vulnerable.]{.underline} President [Xi]{.underline}
Jinping [has staked his rule on delivering a "rich and strong" country.
If wealth no longer flows as before, he might feel **more inclined to
showcase power**.]{.underline}

The next test will come this week when Taiwan elects a new president.
Opinion polls predict a landslide win for Tsai Ing-wen, whose Democratic
Progressive Party espouses independence for Taiwan.

Last year, Mr. Xi shook hands with Taiwan's current leader Ma Ying-jeou
in a historic encounter in Singapore that emphasised the goal of "One
China," a union of the island with the mainland. Ms. Tsai refuses to
endorse that principle, leaving Mr. Xi the choice of waiting out her
four-year term or applying pressure to get her to change her mind.

Mr. Xi cannot afford to look indecisive if it appears that Taiwan is
slipping away --- particularly if his prestige is threatened at home by
a swooning economy. Some analysts think he may, if he feels cornered,
consider trade sanctions such as throttling the flow of Chinese tour
groups to Taiwan.

[Watch out, too, for China to start air patrols over the Spratlys from
its new base on Fiery Cross Reef, or to formally declare an Air Defense
Identification Zone over the South China Sea to monitor foreign
aircraft,]{.underline} just as it did over the East China Sea where it's
engaged in territorial disputes with Japan and South Korea. [Either move
would **dramatically raise regional tensions.**]{.underline}

Yet the jaunty style of the inaugural Spratly Island flights projects a
deeper political meaning: It shows that **[China feels it must carefully
calibrate its displays of strength]{.underline}**, [not only to avoid
roiling its neighbours but because it knows that **nationalist emotion
at home can rebound on the regime.**]{.underline}

[History shows how anti-Japanese protests whipped up by state media on
the streets of Chinese cities can quickly morph into anti-government
unrest. A troubled economy that further exposes a society polarised by
extremes of wealth and poverty is sure to galvanise urban malcontents if
fresh demonstrations erupt.]{.underline}

### Econ Impact -- CCP

#### A failed economic transition in China leads to instability, insecurity, and increased tensions with Taiwan Alexis Leggeri, 10-29-20, (Alexis Leggeri is a PhD candidate at the City University of Hong Kong, International and Asian Studies Department. \"What Happens to the CCP If China's Economic Growth Falters?,\" No Publication, <https://thediplomat.com/2020/10/what-happens-to-the-ccp-if-chinas-economic-growth-falters/>) \-- sri

Amid growing tensions around President Xi Jinping's international
assertiveness and the COVID-19 pandemic, important changes in two key
policy areas -- domestic security and consumption -- are slowly taking
China toward a crossroads for its "Chinese Dream." While these policy
areas are often analyzed separately, they actually constitute [a nexus
that underpins China's political stability -- a growth-based political
legitimacy backed by an expanded security apparatus]{.underline}. As a
result, the [current policy changes hold the potential to amend the
dynamics of political stability in China, with consequences for its
political economy and foreign policy]{.underline}. On consumption, the
"dual circulation" strategy was pitched by Xi in May 2020 and is likely
to be part of the 2021 five-year plan, the main planning framework for
the Chinese economy. The strategy aims to strike a better balance
between the internal and external aspects of the Chinese economy, to the
benefit of the former, partly through further policy support for
domestic consumption. This is in line with the Chinese Communist Party
([CCP)'s objective to turn China into an innovative and
consumption-driven economy by 2049, as its investment- and export-led
growth model exhausts itself. On domestic security, Xi]{.underline} in
the summer of 2020 [launched a political campaign allegedly aimed at
purging the security apparatus and ensuring its absolute
loyalty,]{.underline} a campaign which will last until he renews his
mandate in early 2022. [This and the growing depth of the Social Credit
System -- a still fragmented AI-backed surveillance system that
attributes scores to citizens based on their behavior -- are key pieces
in Xi's domestic power consolidation,]{.underline} which is taking
government control over society to a level unprecedented since Chairman
Mao. Given this upward trend in terms of domestic security capacities,
[what would be the consequences of a failed economic transition toward a
more consumption-driven economy? Would such an event necessarily lead to
political change, as often claimed?]{.underline} China's growth has
clearly rebalanced toward consumption. Between 2010 and 2019, private
consumption as a proportion of GDP rose from 34.6 to 38.8 percent.
However, China's domestic consumption has taken a downward path over the
past few years. Indeed, after stagnating at about 11 percent in
2016-2017, China's private consumption growth rate declined to 9 percent
in 2019. Structurally, China's gross domestic saving rate remains at
exceptionally high levels by global standards, and constrains
consumption. After a period of decrease starting in 2010, China's gross
saving rate has been stabilizing at roughly 45 percent of GDP since 2016
-- by comparison, the United States' rate was about 17.7 percent in
2019. This downward trend can be partly explained by specific factors
such as the growing weight of fast-increasing household debt or the
recent crackdown on money lending businesses, which has curtailed
households' access to credit. These factors notwithstanding, the current
trend fundamentally reflects long-standing structural drags on
consumption that have gained salience during the pandemic: social
security and inequality issues. The pandemic has shed light on the
weakness of China's social safety net, which pushes the Chinese to save
up a large share of their income. Indeed, despite 95 percent of its
population being covered by various health care plans, China's average
out-of-pocket share of health expenditure still amounted to 35.9 percent
of total health spending in 2018, as opposed to 10.6 percent in the
U.S., with sizable gaps between urban and rural plans, which further
disadvantage poorer rural dwellers. Likewise, in the midst of the
pandemic, only 2.3 million people were eligible for unemployment
benefits, whose level is set under the country's very low minimum wage.
The rest of the estimated 78 million unemployed people were forced to
survive on their own means. In the absence of a strong safety net, the
pandemic has strengthened another major obstacle to consumption:
economic inequality. The situation of the poorer and less protected
households deteriorated much more than that of the richer households.
Inequalities have been historically cemented by the hukou system, a
household registry that ties Chinese citizens' access to public services
and benefits to their birthplace. The system created a vast pool of
"second-class" citizens who have migrated to cities for low-paid
employment but are entitled to none of the rights enjoyed by urban
dwellers. In response, the government has loosened the rules of the
system over the past few years. However, in reality, the most attractive
cities leverage the new rules to attract wealthy and educated migrants,
thus excluding the bulk of rural dwellers and leaving the problem
unsolved. It is clear that [China's transition toward a
consumption-driven economy]{.underline} must involve the solving of
long-standing issues. However, from China's perspective, [the difficulty
is that these issues are embedded in a network of intertwined and
politically sensitive matters, which complicates any
solution]{.underline}. For instance, the ending of the hukou system
would further pressure Beijing to establish an extremely expensive
nationwide social safety net, given the country's size and fast-aging
population. Funding such an endeavor would require China to reshuffle
its tax system and curb the downward trend of its real fiscal revenue.
This would mean increasing the contribution of the income tax to the
country's revenues -- 9 percent of total fiscal revenues in 2018 --
which mostly rely on consumption and corporate taxes. Such a move is
obviously highly politically sensitive. Beijing could also reform its
financial system to complement its social safety net and enhance support
to the under-financed private firms that are the main source of
productivity and wage growth in China, but received only 11 percent of
new loans in 2016. However, this is equally difficult. Such a reform
would entail a complete revamp of the state banking system, as well as
solving the long-standing issue of inefficient state-owned enterprises,
which would require China to dramatically reform its methods of economic
governance. China 2049 Considering these structural impediments to
imperative reforms, the success of China's economic transition is far
from assured -- and failure would lead the country into a period of
economic stagnation like that of Japan. However, the case of Egypt shows
that authoritarian regimes may survive such difficulties, as long as
they have the right security apparatus. After President Jamal Abdel
Nasser's death in 1970, successive Egyptian governments gradually
insulated themselves from an impoverishing population and maintained
political stability via the continued increase of the country's domestic
security capacity. Egyptians only managed to overcome this insulation
and have a say in politics during the 2011 Tahrir Square revolution,
after four decades of steady social deterioration. In this light, it is
reasonable to argue that [the failure of China's economic transition
could lead to new dynamics in terms of political stability]{.underline},
[but not to regime change]{.underline}. In other words, [the CCP would
rather rely on domestic security than growth to sustain its
power]{.underline}. Under such circumstances, the CCP would certainly
strengthen its late trend toward increased statism. [Economic governance
could become more politicized]{.underline}, as strategic competition
with the U.S. is unlikely to disappear, with more decisions being made
on national security grounds. Beijing's recent steps toward the
decoupling of the Chinese and American economies may be an early symptom
of this longer-term securitization trend. That would certainly
jeopardize the Chinese market's process of opening, to the detriment of
foreign economies. Lastly, Beijing's less outgoing international stance,
amid its broader diplomatic difficulties, may inform us of its future
foreign policy. Indeed, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Xi's
flagship policy, seems to be slowly running out of steam. The number of
new Chinese overseas construction contracts, an imperfect proxy for the
BRI's infrastructure activities, sharply decreased in 2018, after years
of fast-paced growth. This reflects Xi's changing global vision, which
has been introduced through a number of speeches. For instance, he
emphasized China's need to refocus on its domestic development in a
series of recent speeches on the domestic aspect of "dual circulation"
and he called for more tech- and innovation-oriented interactions with
the global economy in a speech in Shenzhen in October. In sum, [Beijing
is likely to become more inward-looking and engage with the world more
strategically in key areas]{.underline}, [while its foreign policy could
further focus on its "core interests," as suggested by the growing
tensions in the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}. [A failed economic
transition could strengthen these trends, as Beijing's sense of
insecurity would grow]{.underline}. Nevertheless, China has not reached
its "China Dream" crossroad just yet. The recent actions toward propping
up its post-pandemic consumption could contribute to pushing Beijing to
undertake the reforms necessary to reach its 2049 goal.

#### An economic decline is the biggest threat to the CCP Joshua Ball, 4-10-2020, (\"**[An Economic Downturn in China is the Greatest Threat to Chinese Domestic Security]{.underline}**,\" Global Security Review, <https://globalsecurityreview.com/degree-chinas-internal-stability-depend-economic-growth/>) \-- sri

For decades, Western academics, policymakers, and analysts assumed that
China's embrace of capitalist economic policies would set the stage for
democratic reform. Almost three decades later, however, the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) remains firmly in power under the increasingly
autocratic leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping. While the
[CCP-controlled government faces a range of threats from groups within
its borders, the idea of a downturn in the Chinese economy remains a
very legitimate threat]{.underline}. The Chinese government has
radically [modernized its economic policies]{.underline} over the past
three decades, [completely reversing their initial Marxist or Maoist
aversion to providing monetary compensation for labor]{.underline}.
These reforms are [responsible for the significant growth of the Chinese
middle clas]{.underline}s, which has the **[potential to be the most
influential group]{.underline}** in China when looked at in regards to
socio-economic status. As a result, [the **considerably large middle
class has come to perceive the CCP as being responsible for their rising
levels of prosperity**.]{.underline} China has undoubtedly experienced
the effects of the 2008-2009 global economic crisis; it indeed fared
much better than the majority of the world. However, China still faces
many hurdles to overcome. Rising Debt and Escalating Unemployment for
Chinese College Graduates It is becoming [increasingly difficult in
China for college graduates to find]{.underline} [jobs]{.underline}, the
[volume of China's exports is dropping]{.underline}, and [tens of
millions of workers are out of work]{.underline}. The [possibility of a
financial crisis in China could challenge Beijing's ability to hold up
its side of the deal with the population.]{.underline} Since the
inception of Jiang Zemin's 'Three Represents,' meant to attract private
entrepreneurs to party membership, the middle and upper classes have
seen the party as being responsible for their economic well-being. [The
government provides an environment for a healthy, regulated economy, to
encourage the creation of private wealth and property, and in return has
its rule legitimized by its people]{.underline}. Arguably, while it is
individuals are responsible for the creation of personal wealth, the
party made it possible. [If the government or party cannot guarantee
jobs to the people, there remains the little reason for the people to
tolerate the strict control that the party maintains over the state. If
the CCP-controlled government cannot sustain economic growth, it could
be perceived by members of the growing middle class as violating the
social contract that has existed between China's citizens and the
country's ruling party elite.]{.underline} The CCP could face a
challenge to its legitimacy if and when the time comes that it is unable
to guarantee a healthy economy, prompting potential discontent from the
middle class.

### Econ Impact -- Global Econ

#### Global economic improvement depends heavily on China's economic recovery

[Russia's war in Ukraine and Covid-related shutdowns in China have led
to both slower growth prospects and higher inflation for the global
economy]{.underline}. What was expected to be a continued strong
recovery has been transformed in the second quarter to a stalling global
economy. [Worsening consumer and business sentiment, increased
inflation, and central banks moving to tighten monetary policy, with the
US Federal Reserve being the most aggressive, have increased the risk of
a global recession]{.underline}. The Bank of England is already
predicting a [recession in the UK, and Germany's GDP likely declined in
the current quarter]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [a soft landing for the
global economy may still be possible, depending on the strength of an
anticipated recovery in the Chinese economy]{.underline} along with
other large Asian economies. Positive global growth still looks likely
to return in the second half of this year, with real GDP growth for the
year 2022 at 3% and at a similar rate next year.We have written about
[the central role that China plays in the global economy. It has the
second largest economy, following the US, and is the world's leading
exporter, with critical supply chain connections to most
economies]{.underline}. While there has been a lot of talk about
"decoupling" from China, the reality is that [the world economy remains
heavily connected to the Chinese economy]{.underline}. [When China
imposed widespread lockdowns in April in pursuit of its zero-Covid
policy, its economy was dealt a major blow.]{.underline} Output in both
the industrial and service sectors turned negative in April; port
activity was disrupted; and retail sales fell some 11%.[In May, Covid
restrictions were eased; supply disruptions were reduced; and economic
policy stimulus measures were increased,]{.underline} with promises of
more to come. [The Chinese economy responded more robustly, than the
market expected.]{.underline} Industrial production returned to positive
growth, led by automobile and electric machinery production. Fixed-asset
investment rebounded, led by infrastructure investment. The decline in
retail sales continued but at a slower pace, which beat market
expectations. China's Covid statistics improved dramatically. The
seven-day average daily case numbers have dropped to about 200, compared
with some 30,000 in April. Nevertheless, mass testing is being imposed
in some areas; and there have been some new, limited shutdowns. The
Chinese economy probably hit bottom in April. Economic momentum appears
to be picking up in June as more of the economy comes back online, the
Shanghai lockdown has been lifted, and policy stimulus measures are
having an increasing effect. Monetary and fiscal measures are being
targeted to support small and medium-sized enterprises, real estate,
manufacturing, and infrastructure financing. "Normalization" of the
supervision of technology companies, following a year of regulatory
crackdowns, and an outright pledge of support for the sector are welcome
news to investors. Such measures to shore up domestic demand and improve
export potential will be critical for maintaining the recovery in the
second half and in 2023, when external demand may continue to be weak.
[Fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war will be a negative factor, causing
a global supply shock to energy and food. China's economy is projected
to achieve an annual growth rate of about 4% this year.]{.underline}
That would be just half the growth rate of last year but still stronger
than the growth of most other economies. Growth in 2023 may average over
5%. Future Covid outbreaks will continue to be a risk to this outlook,
although the government has modified its anti-Covid policies to be
somewhat less disruptive.[Economies in the Asia-Pacific region will
benefit from a recovery in China.]{.underline} Particularly important
will be a reduction in the disruptions in Asia's supply chains. [China
has already had substantial success in its efforts to reduce logistics
hurdles and otherwise support foreign trade. Chinese goods exports in US
dollar terms increased 16.9% year/year]{.underline} in May compared with
just 3.9% in April. Supply delivery times also improved in May. Stronger
growth in China and fewer restrictions on activity should have a healthy
effect on the Chinese demand for the exports of other Asia-Pacific
economies. South Korea's exports to China stabilized in May. The region
will be affected by the Russia-Ukraine war mainly through the impact of
the war on the region's export markets, particularly those in Europe.
Nevertheless, growth rates in the region's resilient economies are
likely to remain among the globe's strongest, with this year's growth
rates for India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines all
likely to be above 5%. [If our expectations for a sustained recovery in
China's economy are in the ballpark, China's stocks are likely to
outperform]{.underline}. That has already been the case over the past
three months through June 17, an otherwise dismal period for global
equity markets. During this period, the Shanghai market managed a gain
of 2.0% while the S&P 500 lost 17.7% and the STOXX Europe 300 lost
11.1%. At Cumberland Advisors, we currently have a positive but
underweight position in Chinese equities in our International and Global
Equity ETF Portfolios. That position can change any day depending on
developments.

concern over the China slowdown and amid the Beijing government\'s
efforts to shift its manufacturing dependent economy to one that is more
dependent on domestic consumption. It also comes at a time when the
central banks of developed nations such as the US Federal Reserve are
taking a call on raising their interest rates after taking into account
the economic activity in China and other emerging markets. [[The IMF

### China Hege Good

#### China heg key to regional stability---Chinese dominance in South Asia checks territorial disputes and strengthens their ties with surrounding countries.

But, the limits and opportunities of Chinese hegemony in Asia lie in
legitimately navigating the structurally, politically and culturally
different sub-regions of Asia. Emphasising the existence of many
'Asias', this article focuses on South Asia to articulate that China's
increased economic and financial capacity in South Asia has not directly
translated into creating a regional order suitable to its own security,
economic and ideological interest -- an essential characteristic of
hegemonic ordering. China's Bid in South Asia Analysed as China's
'Regionalism Policy 2.0', arrangements such as Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI) have put South Asian states at the centre with a different
purpose. With its increased manufacturing capacity, [China has
increasingly fit the available role of development-finance provider in
the region]{.underline}. Its exports have also seen a growth of 546
percent in the region since 2005 with a prominent trade imbalance in its
favour. With 'imbalanced' trade deficits and outpouring of
'less-conditional' infrastructural funding, Beijing has increasingly
challenged the 'openness' and 'diversity' maintained by South Asian
states in their economic engagement. In case of Pakistan, China's
financial diplomacy is primarily directed towards securing shipping
corridors and pipelines, ensuring Beijing's strategic and energy
requirements under China--Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Pakistan
has experienced significant dependence as a result. Even a major economy
like India faces this challenge of avoiding dependence. [Under Xi
Jinping']{.underline}s 'Great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation'
rhetoric, [neighbourhood 'connectivity' has become an integral part of
re-envisioning the norms, rules and mutual understandings of global
governance]{.underline} within South Asian regional order. [China has
extended its presence by 'brokering' close relationships with the elite
sympathisers based on development promises whereas people-to-people
diplomacy still takes a back seat.]{.underline} South Asian political
elite's strong desire to attract investment and Beijing's upper hand as
a 'giver' in negotiations have had a silencing effect on debates on
transparency, accountability, human rights and environment impact under
nascent and weak governance institutions in the region despite South
Asian states' commitment to further promote and institutionalise
democracy. China's attempts to instrumentalise public goods 'dominance'
to influence the security dynamics of the region have also become
bolder. According to Christian Wagner, India's self-restraint via
bilateral security framework with its neighbours had helped develop a
'regional security architecture' in Post Cold-War South Asia. [Both
external powers, United States and China, till recently, have shown a
rather limited interest in strategic ordering of states within the
region.]{.underline} Their attention was either triggered by certain
events or a particular state's degree of security-engagement with them.
India, however, has risked its legitimacy to be a norm enforcer in
issues such as Maldives' democratic and Nepal's constitutional crisis.
China avoided any 'unnecessary friction' in the region. [However, it has
begun to focus on strengthening elite ties in the region and utilised
anxieties towards India's norm-enforcing to make way for its strategic
interests.]{.underline} [In its drive to strengthen access to energy
resources and enhance stability and development in its land-bound
western provinces, South Asian littoral states have risen up in China's
strategic priorities.]{.underline} Since New Delhi's firm opposition to
Xi's dream initiative, [India has become an 'adventurous' brother in
need of disciplining, in other terms, strategic rival.]{.underline} The
dynamics of the region have become more and more complex and vulnerable
with 'renewed' focus on Indian Ocean's geo-strategic importance and the
race to develop dual-use infrastructure in the region. In its 2019
Defense White Paper, Chinese government reassured the world that unlike
'big power' China will never seek hegemony, spheres of influence or form
alliances, yet it is actively seeking the same in South Asia. A Yellow
Brick Road? How far has this worked? Popular scholarship on hegemony has
long rallied behind materially dominant states' ability to craft their
world orders but the road to hegemony has become increasingly cumbersome
and trivial. China's rise in South Asia has opened it up to
politicisation and increased scrutiny at both elite and mass levels.
Beijing's intention to multiply its political, security, economic,
social and cultural interactions within the region with an 'all in one
go' approach has had a startling effect, and not always in its favour.
China's flexing of its economic muscles to take over Hambantota port in
Sri Lanka, in lieu of outstanding debts, has warned other states to be
mindful of the strategic implications of China's presence. [The approach
of 'caution' and consideration of 'national interest' with net risk
assessment has been the mantra]{.underline} in Bangladesh, while
Pakistan, despite the significant alignment of its interests with China,
is facing a suppressed internal debate and disruption in project areas
of CPEC, calls to engage locals rather than bring workers from China for
Chinese projects, and demands for Baloch autonomy near the Chinese-aided
projects in Gwadar port. China has broken its 'golden' rule of not
taking sides in India--Pakistan conflict over Kashmir and has enhanced
its border incursions along India--China border to force India to adhere
to China's interests. Recurring arm-twisting and skirmishes, with
increased infrastructure capability, along the border has reinvigorated
the trust issues Indian strategic and political community already had
with China. The rising aggressiveness under Xi's China has pushed India
to actively involve United States, Japan, European Union and Australia
with the region's security and potential development. United States and
India have substantially increased soft loans and foreign aid to enhance
capacity-building in the region and Japan has emerged as the most
welcomed foreign-direct-investment partner. Such diversification, as
highlighted by Carla P Freeman has also given the 'smaller states in
their shared neighbourhood new opportunities to operate on the regional
stage as foreign policy actors with the ability to act more
independently' both from China and India. There is emerging multi-power
activism in the maritime domain with positive backing for India as a
more suitable partner than China. A simple point: Can states critical of
India's economic dominance even under non-interference norms in the
region be really appreciative of overbearing dominance of other regional
powers? South Asia has rarely been the centre of United States'
hegemonic ambitions, but [Xi's China has increasingly manipulated its
'giver' position in the region and has become eager to utilise force and
take sides, especially in case of India's territorial disputes with its
neighbours]{.underline}. Its engagement is to maintain its strategic
superiority on sea lines of communications. China has pushed the region
to walk a tight rope between economic cooperation and strategic
implications but, even being materially less capable, [the region has
displayed its assertiveness on certain issues and chosen to co-opt each
other's interests.]{.underline} Thus, where China lacks cultural
legitimacy as a power, preferring large-scale economic activism has
harmed its win-win narrative for Asia as a region. Sectors driving its
hegemonic aspirations are constantly contested, resisted, renegotiated
and reproduced in interaction with the existing norms across
state/societal levels and state/non-state units. China's material
capability has not translated in South Asian states' allegiance to its
world vision. **[A multifaceted regional order arranged across different
powers and their functional responsibilities is considered more
stable.]{.underline}** It is preferred to the one China is currently
attempting to rearrange and rework to establish its hierarchical
prominence.

#### Chinese global governance leadership [as a first mover]{.underline} is key to stabilize great power relationships

**Jones 16** (Bruce, Vice President and Director - Foreign Policy;
Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Project on International Order and
Strategy, Brookings Institution, 4/12/16, "China's G-20 presidency:
Where geopolitics meets global governance,"
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2016/04/12/chinas-g-20-presidency-where-geopolitics-meets-global-governance/)

For the past several years, international affairs have been analyzed
through two lenses. One lens has focused on geopolitics: in particular,
the question of how [great power relations are evolving]{.underline} at
a time of redistribution in the world's economic and now also political
power. The second lens considers the framework of global governance,
especially the question of whether or not the existing formal and
informal institutions have the tools and the ability to manage complex
global challenges. [[China's presidency of the G-20
bridges]{.underline}]{.mark} the issues of [[global governance and great
power relations]{.underline}]{.mark}. At a basic level, [[the G-20 will
set a tone for **how major powers**]{.mark} **attempt to [tackle]{.mark}
the [challenges that confront us all]{.mark}**]{.underline}. China's
assumption of the G-20 chairmanship in 2016 marks an important symbolic
threshold. It is the first time a major non-Western power will chair the
world's premier body for international economic cooperation---not to
mention one of the world's most important geopolitical bodies, as well.
China's presidency comes at an important time in the substance of the
G-20's agenda, too, as a slowing Chinese economy is integral to the
dynamics of an overall slowing global economy. As such, this event
offers an opportunity to reflect on geopolitics and global
governance---and the way forward. In short, what is the state of
international order? HEADING DOWN A BUMPY ROAD? There is little doubt
that [[we are at an]{.mark} **important [inflection point in
international order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For the past 25 years,
[[the]{.mark} international [system]{.mark}]{.underline}---with its
win-win economic structures---has been relatively stable. But this order
[[is under challenge and threat, and]{.mark} it [is **eroding**. We
risk]{.mark} the **rise of [a lose-lose international system]{.mark}**,
encompassing a [deterioration of]{.mark} the **[security relations
between great powers]{.mark}**, and a [breakdown of]{.mark} the **[basic
structures of international coop]{.mark}eration**]{.underline}.
[[That]{.mark} may be]{.underline} the [[worst-case]{.underline}]{.mark}
scenario, [but it [is]{.mark}]{.underline} a
**[[plausible]{.underline}]{.mark}** one. [Countries must be vigilant
about preventing this outcome]{.underline}. Even though the established
powers and the so-called emerging powers (clearly China is an emerged
power) may not hold the same views about the content of international
order, all sides have a stake in pursuing intense negotiations and
engaging in debate and dialogue. [It is imperative]{.underline} that
[parties find a middle ground that preserves key elements of the
existing order while introducing]{.underline} some degree of
[adaptation, such that this order does not collapse]{.underline}. A
version of this kind of negotiation may occur later this year. Japan's
presidency of the G-7 will begin just ahead of China's presidency of the
G-20, putting important issues into sharp relief. As the older,
Western-oriented tool for managing global issues, the G-7 still focuses
on global economics but increasingly tackles cross-cutting and security
issues. The G-20 is the newer, multipolar tool through which both
emerged and emerging powers collaborate---but, so far, members have
limited their deliberations to economic issues. The two processes
together will reveal the tensions and opportunities for improvement in
great power relations and in geopolitics. Of particular note is where
political and security issues fall on the dockets of these two bodies.
Although the G-20 did tackle the Syria crisis at its St. Petersburg
meeting in 2013, political and security issues have otherwise not been
part of the group's agenda. But these topics form an important part of
the landscape of great power politics and global governance, and they
are issues for which we find ourselves in very difficult waters.
Tensions between the West---particularly Europe---and Russia are running
high, just as disputes are mounting in Northeast Asia. The question of
America's naval role in the Western Pacific and China's claims of a
nine-dash line are serious flash points in the U.S.-China relationship,
and we should not pretend that they are not increasingly difficult to
manage, because they clearly are. These are not part of the formal
agenda of the G-20, but they should be. Although many economists may
disagree with me, I believe it is shortsighted for the G-20 not to take
up some of these tense security issues. The group's argument has been to
focus on economic issues, for which there are shared interests and
progress can be made, which is a fair point. But history tells us that
having difficult, tense issues involving a number of stakeholders leads
to one of two scenarios: either these issues are managed in a credible
forum, or tensions escalate and grow into conflict. There is no third
option. Moreover, these are not issues that can be resolved bilaterally.
They have to be settled in a multilateral forum. In 2016, Japan will
take up the issue of the South China Sea in the G-7---a scenario that is
far from ideal, since key stakeholders will not be present. Even so, the
G-20 refuses to take up security issues, leaving countries without an
inclusive forum to deal with these tense security concerns. Of course,
they could be raised in the U.N. Security Council, but that is a crisis
management tool. [[We should be building political relations]{.mark} and
**involving leaders in [preventing great power
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}, all of which, by and large, does not
happen at the U.N. But it could happen at the G-20. WITH GREAT POWER
COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY [[A better dynamic is at work with]{.mark}
respect to]{.underline} the issues of **[[climate]{.mark} change [and
global energy]{.mark} policy]{.underline}**. The Paris climate accords
are counted as a major breakthrough in global governance. To understand
how the outcome in Paris was achieved, we have to look again at great
power relations. What really broke the logjam of stale and unproductive
negotiations was the agreement struck between President Xi and President
Obama. Their compact on short-lived climate pollutants transformed the
global diplomacy around climate change, yielding the broader agreement
in Paris. Why did the U.S.-China agreement on climate change facilitate
the Paris climate accords? The United States and China did not impose a
framework, nor did they insist on a particular process or stipulate a
set of rules. What they did was lead. They acted first and they absorbed
costs. This is the essence of the relationship between great power
politics and global governance. [Great power status confers]{.underline}
a certain set of [privileges, not least of which is a certain degree of
autonomy]{.underline}. To that end, the United States has avoided
multilateral rules more than other countries, and other countries may
aspire to that status. But the larger point is that [[great power status
primarily entails]{.mark} a [responsibility to **act first in
resolving**]{.mark} **tough [global challenges and absorbing
costs]{.mark}**. That is how [great powers lead through]{.mark} a
framework of [global governance]{.mark}. In [today]{.mark}'s world,
[where global governance will **necessarily be more multipolar**]{.mark}
**than in the past**, [we have to find new approaches to
**sharing**]{.mark} **the [burdens of moving first and absorbing
costs]{.mark}**[. That is]{.mark}]{.underline}, far and away, [the [most
likely]{.mark} way [to maintain]{.mark} a]{.underline} relatively
**[[stable]{.mark} but continuously [adapting]{.mark} international
[order]{.mark}]{.underline}**---one that is [[empowered to
tackle]{.mark} global [challenges and **soothe geopolitical
tensions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Multipolarity Good

#### Peaceful multipolarity is likely after a hegemonic decline \-\-- changes in German and Japanese dependence indicate broader regional shift

**Leonard 22** -- *Director of the European Council on Foreign
Relations* (Mark, 6-13-2022, \"The Real End of Pax Americana,\" Foreign
Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/japan/2022-06-13/real-end-pax-americana)//KH

A DIFFERENT KIND OF ALLIANCE

[The Biden administration hopes that the war in Ukraine will cement a
global alliance of democracies, putting both Russia and China on the
back foot.]{.underline} As a result, Beijing regards the conflict as a
proxy war aimed in part at weakening China by convincing Asian countries
of the parallels between Ukraine and Taiwan. The other side of this
coin, of course, is Washington's effort to convince Europeans that if
they want to continue to benefit from U.S. support, they will need to
align with the United States against China.

But [as Germany and Japan become more powerful and more embedded in
their respective regional security orders, they are likely to become
more assertive in setting their own agendas.]{.underline} [That is
precisely what happened in the Middle East, where U.S. retrenchment has
made countries less willing to follow Washington's lead without getting
something in return]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia, for instance, rejected
U.S. requests to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine and to increase
oil production to meet elevated demand. Instead, Riyadh worked with
Moscow to keep oil prices high. Other [U.S. allies in the region,
including Israel and the United Arab Emirates, have been similarly
resistant to U.S. demands.]{.underline}

Many American analysts and officials seem to think that the historic
debt of U.S. allies means that they can be expected to side with the
United States against China in more and more domains and at ever greater
cost. Trump provided the perfect illustration of this when he threatened
to withdraw from NATO while demanding that Europeans ban the Chinese
technology giant Huawei from their 5G networks.

But [the changes afoot in Berlin and Tokyo suggest that a different kind
of relationship is on the horizon, one that is more balanced than the
alliances Washington built and maintained in the postwar
era]{.underline}. As the relative importance of U.S. defense
contributions falls and the costs of alignment rise[, it seems unlikely
that Washington will be able to count on automatic support. Instead, the
United States will have to get used to more cooperative and equitable
relationships in which alignment is earned]{.underline}. This will
create challenges and headaches initially, especially as [Washington is
forced to rein in its unipolar instincts. But if the new international
order proves stable and helps promote U.S. interests, American taxpayers
might once again start to see the country's network of alliances as an
asset]{.underline} rather than a drain on public resources. Not only
could the burden of providing security be shared more equitably in such
an order but [the United States and its allies would be able to
establish standards and promote liberal values that, although not solely
American, would definitely be more American than Chinese. In other
words, Pax Americana could give way not to chaos but to a cooperative
model of shared leadership.]{.underline}

#### Multipolarity solves -- it's the only option in a post-pandemic world

**Zelikow 22** - *Professor of History at the University of Virginia. A
former U.S. diplomat and Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission, he
has worked for five presidential administrations* (Philip, July/August

IN IT TOGETHER

It [may be easy, and perhaps natural, for the would-be architects of the
new system to organize it around Washington. But that would be a
mistake. The enemies of this new order, united by their resentment of
the United States, will seek to discredit it as just another effort to
dominate global affairs.]{.underline} For this new order to be viable,
it [must be conceived in such a way that the charge is
false.]{.underline}

The [new order must also be decentralized to be effective; the resources
and wisdom needed to solve many vexing problems are not concentrated in
the United States.]{.underline} For instance**, [on the enormous issue
of defining rules for a digitized world,]{.underline}** [Washington has
been confused and passive, despite---or perhaps because of---its
dominance in such commerce.]{.underline} It is the European Union that
has led the way. The [EU's General Data Protection Regulation, its
Digital Services Act, and its Digital Markets Act created the standards
that influence most of the world, including the Americas.]{.underline}
Decentralized leadership has [also proved critical to responding to
Russia's aggression in Ukraine]{.underline}. The [nucleus of the
emerging pro-Ukraine coalition, for instance, is not just the United
States but the entire G-7, including]{.underline} [the European
Commission]{.underline}. South Korea and Australia should be invited to
join this coalition as well.

Yet a revised system of world order shouldn't be limited to the United
States and its traditional allies. It must be open to any countries that
can and will help attain its common objectives. [India should have a
place at any symbolic high table, for example, as a permanent member of
the UN Security Council. But India's leaders are still making their
choices about their will and capacity to work on common problems. Even
China should be welcome at the table.]{.underline} After much internal
debate in the early 1990s, [China's leaders chose to play a major and
often constructive role in the global commonwealth system that emerged
after the end of the Cold War. In 2005, Zoellick famously urged Beijing
to become a "responsible stakeholder.]{.underline}" As late as 2017,
Kurt Campbell, who now leads Asia policy for the Biden White House,
thought this invitation was a wise move.

### US Hege Bad

#### American unipolarity sanctions unfettered interventionism, inflaming global conflicts and collapsing multilateral governance regimes.

[[Trump is]{.mark}]{.underline} certainly [[**hostile**
to]{.underline}]{.mark} what he sometimes refers to as "globalism":
**[[multilateralism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**free trade** agreements,
international **institutions**, and any **international legal
regime**]{.underline} [that could impose **constraints** on **U.S.
power**]{.underline}. [[He is **antagonistic** toward **allies and
treaties**]{.mark}, withdrawing]{.underline} the U.S. from the
**[Paris]{.underline}** climate agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP), the Iran nuclear deal, the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty
(INF), the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO), and the UN Human Rights Council. But [those excoriating Trump
for his **disregard for rules** and **norms** rarely mention **similar,
routine violations** of this **rules-based order** by [his
**predecessors**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And while [the foreign policy
establishment is **firm** in its **condemnation** of Trump's "turning
away from global engagement,"]{.underline} as Richard Haass of the
Council on Foreign Relations put it, their harshest criticisms seem
reserved for those few sporadic instances in which Trump tries to
jettison lengthy and failed military deployments, as in Syria and
Afghanistan, or expresses insufficient enthusiasm for permanent overseas
garrisons. [The]{.underline} pundits, practitioners, and [politicians
that make up the foreign policy establishment [have **rarely**
respected]{.mark} the [**non-interventionist principles**]{.mark} at the
core of the United Nations]{.underline}, an institution exemplifying the
liberal rules-based international order that the United States helped
establish following World War II. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter says
"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the
threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political
independence of any state..." According to the Charter, which American
post-war planners helped write, the use of force is illegal and
illegitimate unless at least one of two prerequisites are met: first,
that force is used in self-defense; second, that the UN Security Council
authorizes it. This prohibition against war is not some trivial
aspiration. [[**Non-intervention** is the **centerpiece** of
i]{.mark}nter**national [law]{.mark}** and [the U]{.mark}nited
[N]{.mark}ations [has]{.mark} [repeatedly sought to
**underline**]{.mark} **its significance**]{.underline}. In 1965, the
General Assembly declared "No state or group of states has the right to
intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the
internal or external affairs of any state." Again in 1970,
[it]{.underline} unanimously **[reaffirmed]{.underline}** [[the
illegality of "**armed intervention**]{.mark}]{.underline} and all other
forms of interference or attempted threats." In 1981, the General
Assembly further specified that the Charter's "principle of
non-intervention and non-interference" prohibited "any ... form of
intervention and interference, overt or covert, directed at another
State or group of States, or any act of military, political or economic
interference in the internal affairs of another State." [[The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} currently [engaged in]{.mark}
**active [military hostilities]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} at
least seven countries, namely [[**Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen,
Somalia, Libya**, and **Niger**]{.underline}]{.mark}. That tally doesn't
include [[**drone strikes** in **Pakistan**]{.mark}, **combat
operations** in **Kenya, Cameroon**, and **Central African Republic**,
or **other interventions** of unknown magnitude]{.underline}. The true
number might be closer to 14 countries. [The White House is also
**explicitly [threatening]{.mark} U.S. [military action]{.mark}** to
change the regime [in **Venezuela**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
against **[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline} for a host of spurious reasons.
[Not **one** of these cases meets the prerequisites for **legal military
intervention**]{.underline} (a plausible self-defense case can be made
for the war in Afghanistan, but it expired a long time ago). **[[No
other state]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the international system [[uses
force more than the U.S]{.mark}. has]{.underline}. Throughout the Cold
War, [the United States used military means to interfere in other
countries]{.underline} about [twice as often as]{.underline} did [the
Soviet Union]{.underline}. This doesn't include interventions below the
threshold of military action: from 1946 to 2000, [[Washington
**meddled** in **foreign elections**]{.mark} more than 80
times]{.underline} (compared to 36 by the Soviet Union or Russia over
the same period). [[Covert op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} to **[overthrow
democratic]{.mark}ally elected [governments]{.mark}**, as in **Iran,
Guatemala**, and **Chile**, were a **staple** of U.S.
conduct]{.underline} in this period, and according to the Rand
Corporation, "the number and scale of U.S. military interventions rose
rapidly in the aftermath of the Cold War." [The [Congress]{.mark}ional
Research Service [lists more than **200**]{.mark} **individual U.S.
[military interventions]{.mark}**]{.underline} from 1989 to 2018, [a
rate that **no other country** even comes **close** to matching. [It's
**hard for America** to act as the **guarantor** of a **rules-based
order** that it **consistently violates**]{.mark}]{.underline}. When
President [Obama condemned Russia's annexation of Crimea]{.underline} in
2014, saying international law prohibits redrawing territorial borders
"at the barrel of a gun," it was somewhat awkward: [The United States
did exact**ly th**at in the 1999 Kosovo war]{.underline}, which lacked
Security Council approval, and successive administrations have similarly
supported Israel as it annexes and occupies territory in violation of
international law. Secretary of State John Kerry castigated Russia's
territorial grab this way: "You just don't in the 21st century behave in
19th century fashion by invading another country on completely trumped
up pretext." As it happens, that's a rather apt description of the Bush
administration's brazenly illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003. Washington
often appeals to international law to justify military action against
despots who commit atrocities, as it did when it secured UN Security
Council approval in 2011 to bomb Libya. But even there, [when the
initial use of force was authorized, the Obama administration **rapidly
exceeded the mandate of the resolution** by pursuing what amounted to a
**regime-change strategy**]{.underline}. And [such appeals to
humanitarianism are highly selective: U.S. **[military power]{.mark}**
has also been used to [assist **Saudi**]{.mark} **Arabia**, one of
[the]{.mark} world's [most **regressive authoritarian
regime**]{.mark}**s**, [commit **war crimes**]{.mark} and keep an
**impoverished** and largely **defenseless population** [in
**Yemen**]{.mark} **under siege.**]{.underline} America's delinquency
isn't restricted to the use of force. Though 139 other countries have
done so, Washington has refused to sign on to the Rome Statute, which
established the International Criminal Court. And although the United
States has badgered China for violating the UN Convention on the Law of
the Sea, which defines maritime rights and responsibilities, the U.S.
refuses to ratify the treaty itself. For all the talk of China's unfair
trade practices, [the only country that receives more formal complaints
about **WTO violations** than China is the **United
States**]{.underline}---and China does a better job of complying once
complaints are made. The political establishment in Washington has
always accepted this unique role for the United States[. We're the
policeman of the world. We enforce the rules and therefore **assert the
right to violate them**]{.underline}, even as we (often violently) deny
others that same prerogative. Any claim to special privileges rests to
some extent on whether the international community sees it as
legitimate. [The problem is that **[America's]{.mark} increasing
[disregard for the rules]{.mark}** [has **undermined its legitimacy**
and that of the **order itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}: [More than **any
other single nation**, [**its actions** determine]{.mark} the **basis**
of **[international norms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[As U.S.]{.mark}
foreign [policy becomes]{.mark} more **transparently [lawless,]{.mark}**
[the power of **i**]{.mark}**nternational [law]{.mark}** to constrain
state behavior **[weakens]{.mark} accordingly**]{.underline}. [[To
legitimize]{.underline}]{.mark} the Russian annexation of
**[[Crimea]{.underline}]{.mark}**, President [Vladimir [Putin]{.mark}
actually [cited]{.mark} the "**[Kosovo]{.mark}
precedent**."]{.underline} In 2016, [Chinese officials dismissed U.S.
criticisms of Beijing's human rights record by citing the
"notorious...**prison abuse at Guantanamo**."]{.underline} [The United
States]{.underline}, Chinese diplomat Fu Cong told the UN Council on
Human Rights, "[conducts large-scale **extra-territorial
eavesdropping**, uses **drones** to attack other countries' **innocent
civilians**, its **troops** on **foreign soil** commit]{.underline} rape
and **[murder of local people]{.underline}**. [It conducts **kidnapping
overseas** and uses **black prisons**]{.underline}." And when American
officials lambaste Iran for backing the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad
despite his use of chemical weapons, Iranian officials frequently remind
the world that [the United States aided]{.underline} Saddam
**[Hussein]{.underline}** [while he deployed **chemical weapons** on a
**much larger scale.** Our hypocrisy has **always** been a **threat to
our legitimacy**]{.underline}, but in the past it was often managed with
careful rhetoric and diplomatic maneuvers designed to conceal the
discrepancy between our words and our deeds, to camouflage our
violations in language that reinforced the order or appealed to higher
values. [Trump is distinct from his predecessors **not** because his
foreign policy is a **radical departure**, but because he is carrying
out **similar policies** without the **moralistic righteousness of his
predecessors**]{.underline} . [[**Saving the liberal order**
means]{.mark} **adhering** to the **UN Charter's prohibition on the use
of force** except in self-defense]{.underline} or unless authorized by
the Security Council. [It means [**rolling back our global military
footprint** and adopting a more **restrained foreign
policy**]{.mark}]{.underline} that at least approximates the manner in
which we expect other nations to behave. [It means **recognizing** that
the United States is **not exempt** from the **rules and norms** it
often punishes others for **transgressing**]{.underline}, and it means
acknowledging that the foreign policy establishment has done at least as
much damage to the rules-based order as has President Trump.

#### [Receding US power]{.underline} motivates a shift to a [concert strategy]{.underline} --- solves their offense, but a [reassertion]{.underline} of hegemony causes [great-power war]{.underline} and erodes [multilateral governance]{.underline}.

[I think there is a strategy **consistent** with the **international
disposition**: **great power concert.**]{.underline} [[A **concert
strategy** requires]{.mark} that all **[great powers pursue mutual
accommodation]{.mark} and recognize each other's interests as part of a
larger commitment [to maintain international
stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Patrick Porter and Amitav
Acharya argue that a great power concert strategy is the best suited to
adapt to the transfer of wealth and power to Asia along with the
"multiplex" nature of world politics (not to mention a global
perspective on international relations). [The emergence of a diverse
range of state and non-state actors bound together by extreme
interdependence makes it impossible for any **one actor**, such as the
**United States**, to establish **rules for global governance** which
can **mobilize all others**]{.underline}. [On this basis, [a concert
strategy would lead the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to **collaborate
with others**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the basis of mutual co-existence
[[and embrace **joint decision-making**]{.underline}]{.mark} at the
global level for coping with macrostructural processes that threaten all
peoples around the world. In this way, a concert strategy is firmly
grounded the international disposition and can serve as the realization
of progressive internationalism. Security and The Balance of Power [[A
concert strategy can]{.mark}]{.underline} do what establishment foreign
policy cannot, namely [[**de-escalate great power competition** by
**giving up US hegemony**.]{.mark} **If adopted**, the United States
would treat **other great powers,** like Russia, China, and Iran, as
**equal partners** in the **maintenance of global stability** and
incorporate their interests into **regional security agreements**. The
United States would **give up its self-assumed role** as an **unrivaled
global hegemon** and seek a balance of power based on **mutual
respect**]{.underline} with other great powers as partners rather than
enemies. [This kind of international posture would result in a more
**horizontal great power system**]{.underline}, one that Stacie Goddard
as identified as being productive of status quo rather than revisionist
intentions. It would be compatible with recognition of the great power
identities of other states and provide them with ontological security.
[[Transitioning]{.mark} from a **hegemonic security strategy** to a
**balance of power** one [will require]{.mark} that the United States
engage in]{.underline} some degree of
[**[retrenchment]{.underline}**]{.mark} [from its]{.underline} already
**[expansive commitments]{.underline}**. But [**[supporters of
heg]{.mark}emony [are wrong]{.mark}** [when they claim]{.mark} that
[retrenchment will **encourage** ]{.mark}**great power
[aggression]{.mark}** and lead to the **abandonment** of our
allies.]{.underline} [[The U]{.mark}nited [St]{.mark}ates [can engage in
**moderate**]{.mark} **forms of [retrenchment]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}consistent with **great power recognition** [while]{.mark}
still **[maintaining commitments]{.mark} to allies**]{.underline} that
strive to uphold human dignity. For example, were the United States to
support a moratorium on NATO expansion, as Michael O'Hanlon suggests, it
would signal that the United States is no longer interested in moving
the frontiers of its influence to the gates of Moscow and remove the
sense of threat experienced by Russian leaders. By recognizing the
validity of Russian security interests as well as its great power
identity, [the equal relationship made possible by a concert strategy
will **better deal** with the **threat of interstate conflict** compared
to US hegemony.]{.underline} Reviving Global Governance [[A **concert
strategy**]{.underline}]{.mark} informed by the internationalist
disposition [[can]{.mark} further [enable]{.mark} more **[robust]{.mark}
forms of [global governance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Rather than attempt
international cooperation based on a priori liberal normative templates,
the United States would accept the validity of all claims made by
collective actors in world politics in an open-ended and inclusive
process of deliberation. [The result would be **less of a hegemonic
order** and more of a **constitutionalist one,** in which the United
States **binds itself** to a truly **democratic process of
decision-making**]{.underline} at the global level. The emergence of
**[global governance norms]{.underline}** [would be]{.underline} a
function less of hegemonic socialization and more of a right [**held by
all actors** to contest the validity of standards of expected behavior.
In other words, [a **concert strategy** would enable the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [to accept **processes of norm contestation**]{.mark} as
the **motor** of **transnational cooperation** and generate more
**legitimate rules** for **regulating global governance**]{.underline}.
It would expand the US order building project initially identified by
Ikenberry on the basis of restraint and institutional self-binding, but
without retaining its own hierarchical position in world politics or
engaging in hypocritical forms of dominance. The implications for
economic governance are profound: the United States would no longer
exclude from consideration the notion of social democratic regulation of
global capitalism and instead promote non-capitalist perspectives on the
economy. Todd Tucker provides one great example of this approach when he
argues that ISDS arbitration should include labor leaders and social
justice advocates rather than international lawyers chosen by
multinational firms which initiate legal action against sovereign
states. It would also enable the United States to seriously consider
Piketty's call for a global wealth tax, Palley and Chow's call for
minimum wage floors, and a binding multilateral treaty that regulates
global business activities on the basis of human rights. And finally,
[[it would enable the **drastic shift away from fossil fuels**]{.mark}
necessary [to **avoid climate apocalypse.**]{.mark}]{.underline} In
Search of a Global Public Naysayers might argue that all [this degree of
**international cooperation** sounds **idealist**]{.underline}, but
[**all are possible** in a context of **declining great power
competition**]{.underline}. Once the United States recognizes the equal
membership of all others in world politics on the basis of our extreme
interdependencies, it can make possible what Mitzen has referred to as
collective intentionality, or the emergence of a plural subject composed
of several individuals who make and uphold joint commitments to each
other and demand adherence as members of a global public. This kind of
action is what the internationalist disposition can help us
conceptualize, and even realize, through a concert strategy. If
progressive internationalists want to realize their objectives, they
should be willing to turn away from the US establishment and embrace a
concert strategy. [By prioritizing **cooperation on non-state issues**
and resolving **great power competition** through **equal
recognition**]{.underline}, [they can **realize security**]{.underline}
for their own citizens as well as others. However, IR constructivists
remind us that no foreign policy can be enacted by policymakers without
a legitimating national security narrative. Progressive
internationalists must continue to develop a new story about the United
States that rationalizes a concert strategy and renders US national
identity compatible with the pluralism we find in both world politics
and US domestic politics. To develop this narrative, progressive
internationalists should engage radical critiques of democracy, like
those offered by Chantal Mouffe, which seek maximal inclusion of others
and accept difference and conflict as irreducible elements of political
life. A pluralist strategic narrative can thereby serve as the basis for
mutual respect of others and enable the democratization of world
politics.

### AT: China Aggression 

#### China is a defensive realist -- Xi will never go to war with Taiwan and will only practice strategic patience

**Nathan 22** -- *professor at Columbia polisci, Ph.D., Harvard, MA,
Harvard, BA, Harvard* (Andrew J. Nathan, 6-23-2022, \"Beijing Is Still
Playing the Long Game on Taiwan,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-06-23/beijing-still-playing-long-game-taiwan)//KH

[Concern is growing in Taiwan, in the United States, and among U.S.
allies in Asia that China is preparing to attack Taiwan in the near
future]{.underline}. Testifying before the U.S. Senate Armed Services
Committee last year, Admiral Philip Davidson, then the commander of the
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, warned that Beijing might attempt to seize
the island in the next six years. Unifying Taiwan with mainland China is
a key element of Chinese President Xi Jinping's "Chinese dream." And as
the political scientist Oriana Skylar Mastro has argued in these pages,
Xi wants "unification with Taiwan to be part of his personal legacy,"
suggesting that an armed invasion could come before the end of his third
term as secretary-general of the Chinese Communist Party in 2027 and
almost certainly before the end of his probable fourth term in 2032.

[Putin's war in Ukraine has intensified these concerns. Xi's
announcement just before the Russian invasion of a "no limits"
partnership with Moscow, coupled with his failure to condemn Putin's
actions and the Chinese media's endorsement of Russian propaganda, seem
to signal Beijing's support for Russia's territorial
aggression.]{.underline} Beijing may see a strategic opening now that
U.S. political and military resources are tied up in Europe. Moreover,
Chinese leaders may have interpreted the West's response to the Russian
attack as an indication that the United States will not intervene
militarily to defend a country to which it is not bound by a defense
treaty, especially against a nuclear-armed adversary. As David Sacks of
the Council on Foreign Relations has argued, "Chinese policymakers may
conclude that Russia's nuclear arsenal effectively deterred the United
States, which would be unwilling to go to war with a nuclear power over
Taiwan."

But [fears of an imminent Chinese attack are misplaced. For decades,
China's policy toward Taiwan has been characterized by strategic
patience, as has its approach to other territorial claims and
disputes---from India to the South China Sea.]{.underline} Far from
spurring China to jettison this approach in favor of an imminent
military assault on Taiwan, [the war in Ukraine will reinforce Beijing's
commitment to playing the long game. The price Moscow has paid, both
militarily and in the form of international isolation, is but a fraction
of what China could expect if it were to attempt to take Taiwan by
force]{.underline}. [Better to wait patiently for Taiwan's eventual
surrender]{.underline}, as Beijing sees it, than to strike now and risk
winning the island at too high a cost---or losing it forever.

IMPENDING ATTACK?

Fear that China will attack Taiwan had been growing well before Putin
invaded Ukraine. As Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow observed in a
2021 report published by the Council on Foreign Relations, Taiwan is
"becoming the most dangerous flash point in the world for a possible war
that would involve the United States of America, China, and probably
other major powers." In addition to its historical and economic motives
for controlling Taiwan, Beijing feels the need to prevent other powers
from using the island as a base to pressure China militarily or subvert
it politically. For its part, the United States has strong motives for
insisting on what Washington has referred to since 1972 as the "peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan issue"---which, given the anti-unification
sentiments of the Taiwanese people, means an open-ended and perhaps
permanent state of de facto autonomy for the island. Although there is
much emotion on both sides---for China, nationalism; for the United
States, commitment to democracy---what makes the Taiwan issue truly
nonnegotiable are the two countries' security interests.

In 1979, when the United States broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan
to normalize relations with China, Beijing had a reasonable chance of
winning over Taiwan without using force. Taiwan was diplomatically
isolated, militarily weak, and increasingly economically dependent on
the mainland. China encouraged this dependence by establishing a host of
incentives for Taiwanese enterprises to do business on the mainland, by
purchasing Taiwanese exports, and by sending Chinese tourists to the
island. Beijing also invested in Taiwanese media with the aim of
generating favorable news coverage and held exchanges with leaders of
the anti-independence Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party.

But these efforts proved insufficient to stem the tide against
unification in Taiwanese public opinion and politics. According to
opinion polls, the share of Taiwanese voters favoring unification fell
from 28 percent in 1999 to less than two percent in 2022. [An
overwhelming majority favor "maintaining the status quo," which in the
language of Taiwanese politics means sustaining autonomy without
formally declaring independence]{.underline}. Since 2016, the
anti-unification Democratic Progressive Party has controlled both the
presidency and the legislature, and it looks well positioned to win the
next set of national elections in 2024.

[Fears of an imminent Chinese attack are misplaced.]{.underline}

These trends have prompted China to adopt a more threatening posture
toward Taiwan. Beijing has stepped up measures to isolate the island
diplomatically, slowed imports and the tourist trade, trained the
Chinese military to conduct the complicated joint operations necessary
for a cross-strait invasion, and conducted frequent probes of Taiwan's
air defense identification zone. China has also developed what the
Pentagon calls "anti-access/area denial" capabilities---including
long-range precision missiles, submarine-launched torpedoes, antiship
ballistic missiles, cybertools, and space capabilities---designed to
hold at bay a U.S. defense of Taiwan.

These moves have fed speculation that China is building up to a
full-scale attack. In addition to Xi's desire to secure his legacy, [the
shifting balance of power between China and the United States is often
cited by U.S. analysts as a possible motivation for Xi.]{.underline}
[The scholars Michael **Beckley and** Hal **Brands**, for instance, have
suggested that China may attack in the near term because it has reached
the peak of its national strength---and China's leaders know
it]{.underline}. China is looking at a period of decline caused by a
combination of unsustainable debt, rising labor costs, an aging
population, declining productivity, and a critical water shortage.
Meanwhile, the United States and Taiwan have recently started to
readjust their military postures to counter the asymmetric threat China
poses. The Biden administration is pulling Japan and South Korea
together around a commitment to "stability in the Taiwan Strait," and
Western businesses are gradually moving their production sites out of
China because of rising labor costs, lack of a level playing field in
the Chinese market, and COVID-19 restrictions. As this reorientation
gathers steam, the West's economic incentives to avoid war with China
will diminish. By this logic, Beijing has reason to strike before its
adversaries are ready.

WAITING GAME

T[he facts on which such forecasts are based are not wrong, but they are
incomplete. A fuller set of facts suggests that China is still pursuing
a strategy of strategic patience]{.underline} when it comes to Taiwan.
[First, Chinese leaders---rightly or wrongly---seem confident that they
can handle their own problems better than the West can handle its
problems]{.underline}. They [don't deny the challenges that Beckley and
Brands highlight, but they believe the West is in decline]{.underline},
hobbled [by ill-managed and slow-growing economies, social divisions,
and weak political leaders]{.underline}. However, [Chinese strategists
do not seem to believe that China has yet reached a favorable power
balance with the West]{.underline}. As Yan Xuetong, dean of the
Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University, has argued,
"[China's global reach still has its limits. Despite being a major
power, China also thinks of itself as a developing country---and rightly
so, considering that its GDP per capita remains far behind those of
advanced economies]{.underline}."

[Beijing can afford to wait for power in the Western Pacific to tip
decisively in its favor. When Washington comes to understand that the
cost of defending Taiwan is beyond its means, and Taiwanese officials
realize that Washington no longer has the appetite for a clash with
China, Taiwan will pragmatically negotiate an arrangement that Beijing
can accept.]{.underline} In the meantime, China needs only to deter
Taipei and Washington from attempting to lock in formal Taiwanese
independence[. Beijing's shows of force are not precursors of an
imminent attack, therefore, but measures intended to buy
time]{.underline} for history to take its course.

Second, contrary to the common portrayal of China as itching for war,
[Beijing has demonstrated strategic patience in pursuit of its other
goals. A good example is Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea,
where China has built and militarized seven sand islands without
triggering a war with the United States or rival territorial
claimants]{.underline}. It did so by building only on landforms it
already controlled, claiming all along that it wasn't doing what it was
doing. The [rival territorial claimants were too weak to confront China,
while the United States lacked a justification for doing so because it
has no territorial claims where China was building]{.underline}. Beijing
restricted access to but refrained from seizing a landform it contests
with the sole U.S. treaty ally involved in these disputes---the
Philippines---which in any case lacked an appetite to invoke its
alliance with Washington by moving militarily to defend itself.

The conflict in Ukraine is reminding Xi that war is unpredictable and
rule over a resisting population is costly.

[China likewise changed the strategic status quo without triggering an
armed conflict over the contested Senkaku Islands]{.underline}, known in
China as the Diaoyu Islands, [by escalating from an occasional maritime
presence in Japanese waters to a permanent one]{.underline},
supplementing its naval forces with less confrontational coast guard,
maritime militia, and fishing vessels. [Beijing followed a similar
playbook in the contested Ladakh region of India, where Chinese troops
gradually advanced their positions and established a series of new lines
of control]{.underline} with only one confirmed outbreak of shooting
that was quickly contained.

[China has invested in ostensibly civilian port projects across the
Indian Ocean and beyond that could serve as foundations for future naval
operations, raising some alarm but no counteraction]{.underline}.
Beijing has also used its economic and diplomatic influence in Africa,
Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Oceania and its norm-setting
power in international institutions to incentivize governments to align
with China's interests, again generating some alarm but no effective
resistance. [Such diplomatic, economic, and military "**gray zone
tactics"** illustrate that China's strategic behavior is geared toward
the long term rather than the short term, moving from no presence to
sustained presence in a host of arenas without generating substantial
pushback, much less armed conflict (with the exception of the fighting
in Ladakh]{.underline}). That same strategic caution has so far been
evident in China's policy toward Taiwan, where Beijing has dialed up
tension and deterred a Taiwanese drive for independence without
precipitating a crisis.

Finally, [the lesson Xi is likely drawing from Putin's war in Ukraine is
not that territorial aggression would go unpunished militarily by the
West but that it would be both difficult and costly.]{.underline} There
is no reason to believe that Xi is surrounded, as Putin seems to be, by
yes men who will tell him that a war over Taiwan can be easily won.
[Even if he is, however, the grinding conflict in Ukraine is reminding
him that war is unpredictable and rule over a resisting population is
costly. The amphibious operation China would need to undertake to seize
Taiwan would be far more difficult than the land invasion Russia has
carried out in Ukraine]{.underline}. Xi has been reforming the Chinese
military's command structure and ramping up training for such an
operation, but Chinese forces remain untested in actual combat
operations. Meanwhile, [the chances that the United States would
intervene to defend Taiwan have increased as anti-Chinese sentiment has
risen in the United States and Europe]{.underline}---and after U.S.
President Joe Biden remarked last month that defending Taiwan is "the
commitment we made."

[Even if Beijing could win a war over Taiwan, it is unclear that it
could win what would come next.]{.underline} As painful as Russia's
isolation from Western economies has been for Moscow, the [postwar
scenario for the Chinese economy would be even more damaging. China
imports 70 percent of its oil and 31 percent of its natural gas; it is
the world's largest coal producer but still needs to import
more.]{.underline} Although it is striving for food self-sufficiency,
[China is the world's largest importer of food,]{.underline} especially
corn, meat, seafood, and soybeans. Some of these [energy and food
imports come from Russia, but many come from countries that would
sanction China if it invaded Taiwan.]{.underline} And even if they did
not, [China's navy doesn't have the global reach to defend the shipping
routes across which these and many other vital commodities flow. Any war
over Taiwan, even a successful one for Beijing, would deal a devastating
blow to the Chinese economy, creating conditions that would threaten
domestic political stability]{.underline} and usher in the failure, not
the realization, of the Chinese dream.

FIGHTING PATIENCE WITH PATIENCE

None of this is reason for American or Taiwanese complacency. China is
following the dictum of the ancient strategist Sun-tzu: "To subdue the
enemy without fighting is the acme of skill." If Beijing eventually
succeeds in taking Taiwan, it will fatally undermine Washington's
credibility with its Asian---and even its European---allies, challenging
Australia, Japan, South Korea, and other countries to either come to
terms with China or prepare to defend themselves without American help.

[The only way to defeat China's Taiwan strategy of strategic patience is
to exercise corresponding patience, continually adapting American and
Taiwanese deterrence as Chinese arms and training present an
ever-changing and ever-growing threat.]{.underline} This is a tall order
for the United States at a time when its share of global GDP has
declined to less than 25 percent (from 40 percent in 1960) and the U.S.
Navy complains that it doesn't have enough ships to perform all the
missions it is charged with. It is an even taller order for an island
that spends only 2.1 percent of its GDP on defense and that has only
recently begun to move away from an unrealistic reliance on expensive
advanced platforms to stave off a Chinese attack and toward a more
realistic "porcupine strategy" involving mines, short-range missiles,
civil defense, and guerrilla resistance. But if a prolonged standoff in
the Taiwan Strait is the most likely prospect for the future, the side
that that stays in the game the longest is the one that is likely to
come out on top.

#### China isn't revisionist -- economic interdependence and conflict avoidance

**Bader 16** -- *the senior director for Asian affairs on the National
Security Council in the Obama Administration and a former United States
Ambassador to Namibia* (Jeffrey, February 2016, "How Xi Jinping Sees the
World . . . and Why," Brookings Institution,
https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/xi_jinping_worldview_bader-1.pdf)//KH

China's rise has rightfully been drawing attention since long before Xi
Jinping assumed office. But [questions about whether China is a threat
to the international system, a revisionist power, and a would-be
regional hegemon have become much sharper in the three
years]{.underline} since he assumed leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party. How valid are such concerns?

Xi is certainly a more forceful, assertive, and ambitious leader than
his predecessor. He has behind him a China with greater
capacity---economic and military---than any of his predecessors.

China's regional and global footprint is considerably larger than
before, and this has made countries near and far anxious. But [it would
be a mistake, in my view, to view the evolution of China in the last few
years primarily as the product of the vision and imagination of an
aggressive leader.]{.underline} Most of the actions and trends that
worry [observers have been present for some time: the military build-up,
the assertive behavior in the South and East China Sea, the growing
gravitational pull of China's economy, and the political repression and
denial of basic rights to its citizens.]{.underline} There are questions
that deserve attention about how Xi is steering China. But the larger
questions about China's direction both pre-date and will post-date Xi's
tenure.

China is likely to continue, whether under Xi or his successor, to
follow a zig-zag path in its attitude toward the international system
similar to the one described in this paper. [It will further develop its
relationship with the international system and interdependence with
other countries, but at the same selectively adhere to international
norms where they fit its interests and ignore or seek to change them
where they do not. For]{.underline} example, Chinese economic success is
firmly anchored in its relationship with other markets. [Autarky and
self-reliance are not feasible alternatives]{.underline}. [China
benefits from international rules and norms]{.underline} not only [in
the trade and investment area, but in the security realm as well.
Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and
uncontrolled ethnic and civil strife]{.underline} in Central and Western
Asia [would be damaging to China's interests.]{.underline}

[But what Colby overlooks---or rules out---is the possibility of a
version of [Chinese predominance]{.mark} that [is similarly compatible
with or even beneficial to other countries]{.mark}, and does not
eliminate their self-determination or autonomy]{.underline}. Instead, he
presumes that Chinese predominance in the region would inevitably and
invariably be coercive and domineering with the neighbors, and both
[[hostile to and exclusive]{.underline}]{.mark} of U.S. interests in
Asia. But **[[neither of these is a given]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Colby
makes three basic arguments to refute skeptics and bolster his
presumptions about the nature of Chinese hegemony. First, he states that
China, as regional hegemon, could "use its power to disfavor and exclude
the United States from reasonably free trade and access" to Asia "in
ways that would undermine America's core purposes, shift the balance of
power against the US, and ultimately open the country to direct coercion
in ways that would compromise Americans' freedom, prosperity, and even
physical security[." There can be no doubt that Beijing seeks to shift
the balance of power in the region against the United States, but [there
is little reason to believe that it seeks to exclude the United
States]{.mark} from Asia economically, [given China's own reliance on
U.S. trade]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, the notion that Beijing is
looking for opportunities to subject America to direct coercion or to
undermine its freedom and prosperity reflects grossly inflated threat
perceptions. [Beijing is simply not interested in an existential
struggle with the United States, which it recognizes would be
counterproductive to China's interests, and probably
futile.]{.underline} [Second, Colby acknowledges that it "may very well
be true \... that Beijing does not want to create a territorial empire
in Asia," but this "misses the point from a military planning point of
view." China's hegemonic ambitions would require it to thwart or
overcome the "anti-hegemonic coalition," so Beijing "will want to be
able to conquer substantial parts of Asia." This may be true, but [it
equates Beijing's pursuit of a capability with an intention to use it
aggressively]{.mark} and toward expansionist goals. It also presumes a
coercive, hostile, and exclusive version of Chinese regional hegemony,
[dismissing the possibility that Beijing will calibrate its approach in
an effort to avoid conflict and escalation, and in pursuit of **peaceful
coexistence**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Third, Colby judges that China
simply cannot be trusted or given the benefit of any doubt. He
entertains the possibility that Beijing will not pursue "full-fledged
hegemony," or that Chinese predominance in Asia might not be that bad.
"Yet to each of these arguments there is a compelling counterargument,"
he replies. And although China, once established as regional hegemon,
"might pursue a more open-handed approach toward the United States, it
also might very well not," per Colby. Here, Colby invokes the oft-cited
1907 memorandum by British diplomat Eyre Crowe that examined Germany's
pursuit of regional hegemony and has been credited with predicting World
War I. "A state may want regional hegemony but conceal its aspirations
behind lies, deceit, and distractions, as the Crowe Memorandum famously
pointed out in the context of imperial Germany," Colby observes. [But
Colby makes the same mistake that Crowe did when he judges that
Washington cannot afford to take the risk of accepting China's ambitions
as limited or its intentions as peaceful. Crowe argued that it should
make no difference in Germany's case because England needed to prepare
for the possibility of German duplicity or a later expansion of German
ambitions. Similarly, Colby advocates a military strategy to prevent
Chinese hegemony regardless of Beijing's intentions or the nature of
that hegemony. He observes that Beijing "has the most powerful incentive
to hide the extent of its ambitions"---but this is not necessarily true
if China's ambitions are less than Colby thinks they are. More
importantly, he replicates the mistake Crowe made in failing to
recognize or acknowledge that England's behavior would be a variable in
shaping Germany's subsequent behavior.]{.underline} Colby similarly
bypasses the probability that his proposed U.S. strategy will fuel a
security dilemma and prompt Beijing to harden its own strategy and
resolve. [Colby makes several valid assumptions about the importance of
other countries to his strategy since they would make up its
"anti-hegemonic coalition." He is correct that Beijing will attempt to
prevent or break up such a coalition through what he calls a "focused
and sequential strategy" of using coercion and/or enticement to draw its
members away from the United States. Additionally, he is correct that
Washington cannot be sanguine about this. After all, some U.S. allies
and partners may not fully agree with Washington on the nature or extent
of the threat Chinese predominance would pose to their own freedom,
prosperity, and security.]{.underline} They also may have doubts about
the United States' readiness and capability to protect them or prevail
over China in an actual conflict. But although Colby outlines many ways
to address these challenges, he does not sufficiently confront the
potential implications of other countries not fully embracing his denial
strategy or its premises. Many of Colby's core assumptions and judgments
appear to overlook the underlying symmetry between the approaches that
the United States and China have taken to Asia. "[The United States has
no inherent interest in harming China, or in imposing its own hegemony
over the region," he says. "U.S. goals are limited to preventing Beijing
from achieving regional hegemony." But [neither does China have an
inherent interest in harming the United
States]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} And why should the United States
expect Beijing to accept Washington's characterization of its regional
ambitions more than Washington is willing to accept Beijing's? Chinese
leaders have as much reason as their American counterparts to follow
Crowe's advice of not trusting the other side's intentions. Colby argues
that "[China is the power seeking to use military force to change
things," partly because some states are "fearful, jealous, ambitious, or
domineering enough that they are prepared to fight to get their way."
Washington, on the other hand, seeks a "decent peace" by way of
"reckoning with the unpeaceful." [But it is premature at best to judge
that China is inherently unpeaceful, or eager to "use military force to
change thing]{.mark}s]{.underline}." Moreover, the United States is
widely perceived as prepared and even inclined to fight to get its way.
Indeed, Colby's book aims at providing a strategy for doing so.

surrender, as Beijing sees it, than to strike now and risk winning the
island at too high a cost---or losing it forever.]{.underline} Fear that
China will attack Taiwan had been growing well before Putin invaded
Ukraine. As Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow observed in a 2021
report published by the Council on Foreign Relations, Taiwan is
"becoming the most dangerous flash point in the world for a possible war
that would involve the United States of America, China, and probably
other major powers." In addition to its historical and economic motives
for controlling Taiwan, Beijing feels the need to prevent other powers
from using the island as a base to pressure China militarily or subvert
it politically. For its part, the United States has strong motives for
insisting on what Washington has referred to since 1972 as the "peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan issue"---which, given the anti-unification
sentiments of the Taiwanese people, means an open-ended and perhaps
permanent state of de facto autonomy for the island. Although there is
much emotion on both sides---for China, nationalism; for the United
States, commitment to democracy---what makes the Taiwan issue truly
nonnegotiable are the two countries' security interests. In 1979, when
the United States broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan to normalize
relations with China, Beijing had a reasonable chance of winning over
Taiwan without using force. Taiwan was diplomatically isolated,
militarily weak, and increasingly economically dependent on the
mainland. China encouraged this dependence by establishing a host of
incentives for Taiwanese enterprises to do business on the mainland, by
purchasing Taiwanese exports, and by sending Chinese tourists to the
island. Beijing also invested in Taiwanese media with the aim of
generating favorable news coverage and held exchanges with leaders of
the anti-independence Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party. But these
efforts proved insufficient to stem the tide against unification in
Taiwanese public opinion and politics. According to opinion polls, the
share of Taiwanese voters favoring unification fell from 28 percent in
1999 to less than two percent in 2022. An overwhelming majority favor
"maintaining the status quo," which in the language of Taiwanese
politics means sustaining autonomy without formally declaring
independence. Since 2016, the anti-unification Democratic Progressive
Party has controlled both the presidency and the legislature, and it
looks well positioned to win the next set of national elections in 2024.
Fears of an imminent Chinese attack are misplaced. These trends have
prompted China to adopt a more threatening posture toward Taiwan.
Beijing has stepped up measures to isolate the island diplomatically,
slowed imports and the tourist trade, trained the Chinese military to
conduct the complicated joint operations necessary for a cross-strait
invasion, and conducted frequent probes of Taiwan's air defense
identification zone. China has also developed what the Pentagon calls
"anti-access/area denial" capabilities---including long-range precision
missiles, submarine-launched torpedoes, antiship ballistic missiles,
cybertools, and space capabilities---designed to hold at bay a U.S.
defense of Taiwan. These moves have fed speculation that China is
building up to a full-scale attack. In addition to Xi's desire to secure
his legacy, the shifting balance of power between China and the United
States is often cited by U.S. analysts as a possible motivation for Xi.
The scholars Michael Beckley and Hal Brands, for instance, have
suggested that China may attack in the near term because it has reached
the peak of its national strength---and China's leaders know it. China
is looking at a period of decline caused by a combination of
unsustainable debt, rising labor costs, an aging population, declining
productivity, and a critical water shortage. Meanwhile, the United
States and Taiwan have recently started to readjust their military
postures to counter the asymmetric threat China poses. The Biden
administration is pulling Japan and South Korea together around a
commitment to "stability in the Taiwan Strait," and Western businesses
are gradually moving their production sites out of China because of
rising labor costs, lack of a level playing field in the Chinese market,
and COVID-19 restrictions. As this reorientation gathers steam, the
West's economic incentives to avoid war with China will diminish. By
this logic, Beijing has reason to strike before its adversaries are
ready. The facts on which such forecasts are based are not wrong, but
they are incomplete. A fuller set of facts suggests that [China is still
pursuing a strategy of strategic patience when it comes to
Taiwan]{.underline}. [First, Chinese leaders---rightly or wrongly---seem
confident that they can handle their own problems better than the West
can handle its problems]{.underline}. They don't deny the challenges
that Beckley and Brands highlight, but [they believe the West is in
decline, hobbled by ill-managed and slow-growing economies, social
divisions, and weak political leaders]{.underline}. However, [Chinese
strategists do not seem to believe that China has yet reached a
favorable power balance with the West]{.underline}. As Yan Xuetong, dean
of the Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University, has
argued, "China's global reach still has its limits. [Despite being a
major power, China also thinks of itself as a developing
country---]{.underline}and rightly so, considering that [its GDP per
capita remains far behind those of advanced economies]{.underline}."
[Beijing]{.underline} [can afford to wait for power in the Western
Pacific to tip decisively in its favor]{.underline}. [When]{.underline}
[Washington]{.underline} comes to [understand that the cost of defending
Taiwan is beyond its means, and Taiwanese officials realize that
Washington no longer has the appetite for a clash with
China]{.underline}, [Taiwan will pragmatically negotiate an arrangement
that Beijing can accept. In the meantime, China needs only to deter
Taipei and Washington from attempting to lock in formal Taiwanese
independence. Beijing's shows of force are not precursors of an imminent
attack, therefore, but measures intended to buy time for history to take
its course]{.underline}. Second, contrary to the common portrayal of
China as itching for war[, Beijing has demonstrated strategic patience
in pursuit of its other goals. A good example is Beijing's behavior in
the South China Sea, where China has built and militarized seven sand
islands without triggering a war with the United States or rival
territorial claimants. It did so by building only on landforms it
already controlled,]{.underline} claiming all along that it wasn't doing
what it was doing. The rival territorial claimants were too weak to
confront China, while the United States lacked a justification for doing
so because it has no territorial claims where China was building.
[Beijing restricted access to but refrained from seizing a landform it
contests with the sole U.S. treaty ally involved in these
disputes]{.underline}---[the Philippines]{.underline}---which in any
case lacked an appetite to invoke its alliance with Washington by moving
militarily to defend itself. [China likewise changed the strategic
status quo without triggering an armed conflict over the contested
Senkaku Islands]{.underline}, known in China as the Diaoyu Islands, by
escalating from an occasional maritime presence in Japanese waters to a
permanent one, supplementing its naval forces with less confrontational
coast guard, maritime militia, and fishing vessels. Beijing followed a
similar playbook in the contested Ladakh region of India, where Chinese
troops gradually advanced their positions and established a series of
new lines of control with only one confirmed outbreak of shooting that
was quickly contained. China has invested in ostensibly civilian port
projects across the Indian Ocean and beyond that could serve as
foundations for future naval operations, raising some alarm but no
counteraction. Beijing has also used its economic and diplomatic
influence in Africa, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Oceania
and its norm-setting power in international institutions to incentivize
governments to align with China's interests, again generating some alarm
but no effective resistance. [Such diplomatic, economic, and military
"gray zone tactics" illustrate that China's strategic behavior is geared
toward the long term rather than the short term, moving from no presence
to sustained presence in a host of arenas without generating substantial
pushback, much less armed conflict (with the exception of the fighting
in Ladakh).]{.underline} [That same strategic caution has so far been
evident in China's policy toward Taiwan, where Beijing has dialed up
tension and deterred a Taiwanese drive for independence without
precipitating a crisis. Finally, the lesson Xi is likely drawing from
Putin's war in Ukraine is not that territorial aggression would go
unpunished militarily by the West but that it would be both difficult
and costly]{.underline}. There is no reason to believe that Xi is
surrounded, as Putin seems to be, by yes men who will tell him that a
war over Taiwan can be easily won. Even if he is, however, [the grinding
conflict in Ukraine is reminding him that war is unpredictable and rule
over a resisting population is costly]{.underline}. [The amphibious
operation China would need to undertake to seize Taiwan would be far
more difficult than the land invasion Russia has carried out in
Ukraine]{.underline}. Xi has been reforming the Chinese military's
command structure and ramping up training for such an operation, but
[Chinese forces remain untested in actual combat
operations]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the chances that the United States
would intervene to defend Taiwan have increased as anti-Chinese
sentiment has risen in the United States and Europe---and after U.S.
President Joe Biden remarked last month that defending Taiwan is "the
commitment we made." [Even if Beijing could win a war over Taiwan, it is
unclear that it could win what would come next. As painful as Russia's
isolation from Western economies has been for Moscow, the postwar
scenario for the Chinese economy would be even more damaging. China
imports 70 percent of its oil and 31 percent of its natural gas; it is
the world's largest coal producer but still needs to import
more]{.underline}. Although it is striving for food self-sufficiency,
China is the [world's largest importer of food, especially corn, meat,
seafood, and soybeans]{.underline}. Some of these energy and food
imports come from Russia, but [many come from countries that would
sanction China if it invaded Taiwan.]{.underline} And [even if they did
not, China's navy doesn't have the global reach to defend the shipping
routes across which these and many other vital commodities
flow]{.underline}. [Any war over Taiwan, even a successful one for
Beijing, would deal a devastating blow to the Chinese economy, creating
conditions that would threaten domestic political stability and usher in
the failure, not the realization, of the Chinese dream]{.underline}.

#### Empirics and growing normal powers ensure hegemony decline will be peaceful! Indicts Kagan specifically!

**Leonard 22** -- *Director of the European Council on Foreign
Relations* (Mark, 6-13-2022, \"The Real End of Pax Americana,\" Foreign
Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/japan/2022-06-13/real-end-pax-americana)//KH

[Greater German and Japanese assertiveness is likely to go hand in hand
with U.S. retrenchment (and a shrinking of Washington's relative
economic and military might) over the long haul,]{.underline} a trend
that is unlikely to change with the war in Ukraine. [The United States
will be forced to concentrate its limited resources on the challenges
posed by China]{.underline}. Analysts such as Robert [Kagan have argued
that Pax Americana could give way to global chaos. That is definitely
possible]{.underline}. But it [is **not what has happened** in much of
the Middle East, where the United States was most engaged for the last
two decades and where it is now pulling back most
dramatically]{.underline}. Julien Barnes-Dacey and Hugh Lovatt of the
European Council on Foreign Relations have described how there was an
initial surge in regional competition between Iran and Saudi Arabia and
in military conflicts that drew in outside powers, such as Russia and
Turkey. But then [many of these **conflicts slowed down,** and more
locally driven reordering processes began]{.underline}, exemplified by
the August 2021 Baghdad conference that brought key regional actors into
dialogue with one another.

[In Europe, U.S. retrenchment could yield greater sovereignty once
Europeans finally realize that the war in Ukraine will not stop
Washington's long-term pivot to Asia]{.underline}. [One reason that
Europeans have failed to develop a common foreign policy is their lack
of trust in one another. But Moscow's aggression has brought Europeans
together, convincing countries that previously favored engagement with
Russia,]{.underline} such as Germany and Italy, to [embrace a policy of
containment]{.underline}. If this convergence holds, one could see a
real European strategic alignment, backed eventually by a European
armaments industry and even conceivably by a more common European
nuclear deterrent (or at least a willingness by France to share its
deterrent). [In the long term, Europe could forge a common framework to
manage relations with other powers, such as Russia and Turkey, including
through deterrence, selective decoupling to minimize tensions, and some
form of dialogue to prevent escalation]{.underline}. Instead of
continuing to expand the EU and NATO, [Europe might opt for smaller,
more flexible multilateral arrangements involving some of the most
important players, much like the Quad in Asia. In short, the European
order might become more Asian.]{.underline}

At the same time, [Asia is likely to become more European. The United
States will maintain its shift in focus to the Indo-Pacific, but its
economic and military weight will shrink compared with
China's]{.underline}. As a result, [Tokyo and other regional powers will
probably strengthen their ties with the United States yet continue to
diversify beyond their traditional alliances with
Washington]{.underline}. As Michishita put it: "[What we are trying to
do is to invite more friends into the Japan-U.S. alliance."]{.underline}
Already [a new Asian order is emerging that includes ties
with]{.underline} the United States and closer cooperation among [powers
such as Australia, India, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, and
Vietnam.]{.underline} Jimbo says [Asian countries won't form a NATO-like
alliance but rather increase cooperation in areas such as intelligence,
maritime security, and law enforcement]{.underline}. In trade and
commerce, a [certain level of regional integration has already occurred
**without Washington's participation**]{.underline} through the
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific
Partnership---which took shape after the United States walked away from
its predecessor---and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

In terms of security, [a more balanced division of labor could emerge.
Europeans will have to take more direct responsibility for security in
eastern Europe, the Balkans, and the Middle East.]{.underline} [In Asia,
regional powers will have to invest more in their own capabilities to
balance Chinese influence in the region]{.underline}. Elbridge Colby,
who served as a U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Trump
administration, put it this way in an interview with Nikkei Asia[: "The
United States is 5,000 miles away from Japan and Taiwan, so we need
Japan to do more]{.underline}." And as [the European and Indo-Pacific
theaters become more connected---not least through the Sino-Russian
rapprochement]{.underline}---it is even possible that [European and
Asian powers will support one another]{.underline}. Japan and South
Korea, for instance, might ask Europeans to reciprocate their support
for sanctions on Russia. [The result would be more complex regional
orders in which the United States]{.underline} still plays an important
role but [no longer calls the shots.]{.underline}

[In recent years [Moscow and Beijing have worked hard to minimize
tensions over the Chinese presence in the RFE]{.mark}. The Communist
leadership has cooperated whenever the Russian government has sought to
tighten visa procedures and regulate shuttle trade.]{.underline} Beijing
has reiterated on many occasions that it holds no irredentist ambitions,
and it has responded with restraint to intemperate accusations from
Russian regional and federal politicians. For its part the Kremlin has
consistently rejected the notion of a "China threat," whether in general
terms or in the specific context of the RFE. It has given its blessing
to the growth of interregional ties and canvassed the possibility of
Chinese participation in energy and infrastructural projects in the Far
East. It has also managed to bring the regions on-message and contain
the worst of their Sinophobia. The presence of Ishaev, a once vociferous
critic of China, at the signing of the final border agreement in Beijing
in October 2004 highlights the extent to which the Russian side is now
singing the same tune--- at least in public. 83 Such apparent unanimity
is in stark contrast to the open discord that prevailed under Yeltsin.
Goodwill on both sides has led to a clear improvement in the dialogue on
RFE issues, which has become much more constructive. [Crucially there
has been substantive progress to back up the fine sentiments. In
addition to demarcation of the border, "illegal migration" is less of an
issue than at any time since the opening-up of the RFE; interregional
trade is growing; and political contacts between provincial
administrations on both sides of the border are more frequent and
cordial than ever before. It would seem that things could hardly be
better. [Paradoxically,]{.mark} however[, this is part of the
problem.]{.mark}]{.underline} The largely positive state of relations in
the RFE relies disproportionately on the "suspension of disbelief "
discussed in the previous chapter. [[It is as if Moscow and Beijing have
agreed not to delve too closely into the underlying contradictions for
fear of awakening the monster]{.mark}. This softly-softly approach
fosters an atmosphere in which both sides can talk through issues. But
it also risks sliding into self-deception and complacency. [For Moscow,
in particular, benign interaction may obscure the importance of finding
lasting solutions]{.mark} to unresolved problems. Thus far there is
little sign of the Kremlin implementing the measures needed to make the
RFE a viable political and economic entity within the Russian
Federation. Instead, [the government has adopted a band-aid
approach]{.mark}, marked by declarations of intent as impractical as
they are vocal]{.underline}. Whether through lack of interest, a failure
of comprehension, or absence of political courage, it has not managed to
address the region's problems. State investment in economic and social
infrastructure remains inadequate. 84 [[Putin's centralizing political
reforms have not significantly reduced corruption]{.mark} and
misgovernment by local administrations. 85 [Moscow shows little
understanding of the different economic conditions]{.mark} across the
RFE]{.underline}. 86 There has been no progress in regularizing the
importation of Chinese labor for projects in construction, the timber
industry, and agriculture. And the federal government continues to play
games over the development of transnational energy and infrastructural
projects. An uncertain future The continuing expansion of Sino-Russian
partnership ensures, for the time being, a relatively favorable
environment in which to resolve these problems. But time and opportunity
are not unlimited. [While talk of a crisis is premature, the present
state of affairs in the RFE cannot continue indefinitely. 87 A number of
variables could change the situation for the worse. [The first is a rise
in the overall number of Chinese migrant workers]{.mark} and a
corresponding diminution of work opportunities within
China.]{.underline} Although Beijing is taking steps to alleviate this
problem, the pace of domestic modernization will ratchet up employment
pressures for the next decade and perhaps longer. 88 Most workers will
continue to gravitate toward China's cities, while others will find
employment in various Asian countries, Europe, and America. [However,
while Russia will avoid the worst of the overflow, an increase in the
number of Chinese in the RFE is possible. This would exacerbate tensions
between the newcomers and the local Russian population. [The second
variable is macroeconomic. The bilateral relationship has benefited from
high growth rates in Russia and China]{.mark}. These have not only
driven the expansion of trade, but also instilled a new confidence.
[This begs the question]{.mark}, however, [of what might happen in the
event of an economic slowdown or worse in either or both
countries]{.mark}, with knock-on effects for political and social
stability. One potential outcome, already witnessed in the Russia-Japan
relationship, is the emergence of an antagonistic
nationalism]{.underline}. This could manifest itself in several ways:
trade disputes, resource competition in Central Asia, great-power
rivalry across the globe. The most plausible theatre of trouble,
however, is the RFE, because it is here where the Russian and Chinese
sit in direct proximity and where many issues are outstanding. [[Third,
the rise of nationalism could, in time, see a revival of Chinese claims
on parts of the RFE.]{.mark} It was not so long ago that Mao called for
these lands to be returned to China. This coincided with the Sino-Soviet
freeze and the build-up to the 1969 clashes, and highlighted the extent
to which the prominence of such questions rises and falls according to
the overall state of the relationship.]{.underline} A serious downturn,
whether in the RFE or elsewhere, might dilute previous commitments. With
its attention overwhelmingly focused on internal modernization and
Taiwan reunification, Beijing has no interest in resurrecting the
territorial issue for the foreseeable future. But there may come a time
when the Chinese leadership feels either confident or desperate enough
to reassess the situation on its northern frontier. Today's academic
discussions about the "lost one-and-a-half million square kilometers"
could become tomorrow's policy debates. [Even if successive Chinese
leaders remain true to their promise not to raise territorial claims,
the Russians may not believe them. A number of Russian commentators are
asking what happens after Taiwan's reunification with the mainland.
[There is genuine concern that the RFE could be back on the table some
time in the next fifteen to twenty years and that, when the time comes,
Moscow will be unable to withstand Chinese
pressure]{.mark}.]{.underline} 89 Suspicion of Beijing's intentions will
always remain, no matter how often and how vigorously it reaffirms its
present position. To skeptics the only way of guaranteeing Russia's
territorial integrity is to "trust in capabilities, not intentions"---an
attitude that history shows has the potential to generate serious
misunderstandings. Other commentators, including several leading
Sinologists, posit a scenario whereby the Communist Party loses control
of the modernization process and the ensuing chaos sees "millions" of
Chinese fleeing across the border. In that event, the territorial
question would resurface by force of circumstances. 90 [[The widening
demographic imbalance, and Russia's larger population crisis, is the
final variable.]{.mark} The danger is not so much the decline in the
number of working-age Russians, but rather its impact on Russian
self-perceptions and views of the outside world. In particular, it could
heighten such traditional instincts as the "besieged fortress" mentality
and fear of strategic encirclement]{.underline}. In such an atmosphere,
even a modest increase in the Chinese presence in Russia's eastern
provinces could undermine the larger bilateral relationship.

[National-security analysts see China as one of the greatest threats
facing the United States]{.underline} and its allies. According to an
emerging conventional wisdom, [China has the leg up on the
U.S]{.underline}. in part [because its authoritarian government can
strategically plan for the long term, unencumbered by competing branches
of government, regular elections, and public opinion. Yet this faith in
autocratic ascendance and democratic decline is contrary to historical
fact]{.underline}. China may be able to put forth big, bold plans---the
kinds of projects that analysts think of as long term---but [the
visionary projects of autocrats don't usually pan out]{.underline}. Yes,
democratic governments are obligated to answer to their citizens on
regular intervals and are sensitive to public opinion---that's actually
democracies' greatest source of strength. Democratic leaders have a
harder time advancing big, bold agendas, but the upside of that
difficulty is that the plans that do make it through the system have
been carefully considered and enjoy domestic support. Historically
speaking, once a democracy comes up with a successful strategy, it
sticks with the plan, even through a succession of leadership.
Washington has arguably followed the same basic, three-step geopolitical
plan since 1945. First, [the [United States
built](https://www.amazon.com/Present-Creation-Years-State-Department/dp/0393304124)
the current, rules-based international system by providing security in
important geopolitical regions, constructing international institutions,
and promoting free markets and democratic politics within its sphere of
influence]{.underline}. Second, it welcomed into the club any country
that played by the rules, even former adversaries, like Germany and
Japan. And, third, the U.S. worked with its allies to defend the system
from those countries or groups that would challenge it, including
competitors such as Russia and China, rogue states such as Iran and
North Korea, and terrorist networks. [America can pursue long-term
strategy in part because it enjoys domestic political
stability]{.underline}. While new politicians seek to improve on their
predecessor's policies, [the United States is unlikely to see the
drastic shifts in strategy that come from the fall of one political
system and the rise of another]{.underline}. Democratic elections may be
messy, but they're not as messy as coups or civil wars. [Open
societies]{.underline} have many other advantages as well. They
[facilitate innovation, trust in financial markets, and economic
growth.]{.underline} Because [democracies tend to be more reliable
partners, they are typically skillful alliance builders, and they can
accumulate resources without frightening their neighbors.
They]{.underline} tend to [make thoughtful, informed decisions on
matters of war and peace, and to focus their security forces on external
enemies]{.underline}, not their own populations[. Autocratic systems
simply cannot match this impressive array of economic, diplomatic, and
military attributes]{.underline}. David Leonhardt [recently
wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/opinion/sunday/china-economy-trade.html)
in The New York Times, "Chinese leaders stretching back to Deng Xiaoping
have often thought in terms of decades." Commonly cited examples of that
long-term thinking include the Belt and Road Initiative, a program that
invests in infrastructure overseas; Made in China 2025, an effort to
subsidize China's giant tech companies to become world leaders in
21st-century technologies, such as artificial intelligence; and
Beijing's promise to be a global superpower by 2049. Since putting in
place sound economic reforms in the 1970s, China has seen its economy
expand at eye-popping rates, to become the world's second largest. Many
[economists
predict](https://www.newsweek.com/worlds-largest-economy-2030-will-be-china-followed-india-us-pushed-third-1286525)
that China could even surpass the United States within the decade, and
[some have
suggested](http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2043235,00.html)
that China's model of state-led capitalism will prove more successful,
in terms of economic growth, than the U.S. template of free markets and
open politics. I doubt these predictions. Because [autocratic leaders
are unconstrained and do not have to contend with a legislature or
courts, they have an easier time taking their countries in new and
radically different directions]{.underline}. Then, when the dictator
changes his mind, he can do it again. Mao's autocratic China ricocheted
from one failed policy to another: the Great Leap Forward, then the
Hundred Flowers Campaign, then the Cultural Revolution. Mao [aligned
with the Soviet Union in
1950](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/ziliao_665539/3602_665543/3604_665547/t18011.shtml)
only to nearly [fight a nuclear
war](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB49/index2.html) with Moscow
in the next decade. Beginning in the time of Deng Xiaoping, China
pursued a fairly constant strategy of liberalizing its economy at home
and ["hiding its capabilities and biding its
time"](https://www.ft.com/content/05cd86a6-b552-11e7-a398-73d59db9e399)
abroad. But President [Xi Jinping]{.underline} abandoned these dictums
when he took over. As the most powerful leader since Mao---he has
[changed China's constitution to set himself up as dictator for
life---he could once again jerk China in several new directions,
according to his whims]{.underline}, and back again. [According to the
Asia Society](https://aspi.gistapp.com/winter-2020/page/overview), he
has stalled or reversed course on eight of 10 categories of economic
reform promised by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) itself. Moreover,
Xi is baring China's teeth militarily, [taking contested
territory](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/world/asia/south-china-seas-photos.html)
from neighbors in the South China Sea and [conducting military
exercises](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/world/europe/china-russia-baltic-navy-exercises.html)
with Russia in Europe. The problem for Beijing is that [stalled reforms
will stymie its economic potential and its confrontational policies are
provoking an international coalition to contain them]{.underline}. The
[2017 U.S. National Security
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905-2.pdf)
declared great-power competition with China the foremost security threat
to the U.S.; the European Union labeled China a "systemic rival"; and
Japan, Australia, India, and the United States have formed a new "quad"
of powers to balance China in the Pacific. Furthermore, the plans often
cited as evidence of China's farsighted vision, the Belt and Road
Initiative and Made in China 2025, were announced by Xi only in 2013 and
2015, respectively. Both are way too recent to be celebrated as
brilliant examples of successful, long-term strategic planning. A
certain level of domestic political stability is a prerequisite for
charting a steady strategic course in foreign and domestic affairs. But
autocratic regimes are notoriously brittle. While institutionalized
political successions in democracies typically lead to changes of
policy, political successions in autocracies are likely to result in
regime collapse and war. China's "5,000 [years of
history](https://camphorpress.com/5000-years-of-history/)" were
pockmarked by rebellion, revolution, and new dynasties. Fearing internal
threats to domestic political stability---consider the [protests this

than on its national defense. If you follow the money, the CCP is
demonstrating that the government is more afraid of its own people than
of the Pentagon]{.underline}. This [domestic fragility will frustrate
China's efforts to design and execute farsighted plans]{.underline}. If
threats to Chinese domestic stability were to materialize and the CCP

never produced high rates of economic growth over the long term.
[Autocrats are poor alliance builders who fight with their supposed
allies more than with their enemies]{.underline}. And the highest
priority of autocratic security forces is repressing their own people,
not defending the country. The world has undergone drastic changes in
just the past few years, but these enduring patterns of international
affairs have not. Some fear that Trump's nationalist tendencies will
erode the U.S. position, but the momentum of America's successful grand
strategy has kept the country on a fairly steady course. Despite Trump's
criticism of NATO, for example, two new countries have joined the
alliance on his watch, including [North Macedonia this
week](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/02/world/europe/02reuters-nato-northmacedonia.html).
The coronavirus has upended a sense of security in the U.S., leading
many people into the familiar trap of [lauding autocratic China's firm
response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/world/asia/coronavirus-china-united-states.html)
in contrast to the halting and patchwork measures in the United States.
But there is good reason to believe that this assessment will be updated
in America's favor with the benefit of hindsight. Already we are seeing
evidence that conditions are much worse in China than CCP officials are
letting on and that China's attempts at international "disaster
diplomacy" are backfiring. It has been revealed that the CCP has
continually
[misrepresented](https://time.com/5813628/china-coronavirus-statistics-wuhan/)
the numbers of COVID-19 infections and
[deaths](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/stacks-of-urns-in-wuhan-prompt-new-questions-of-virus-s-toll)
in China, and European nations have
[rejected](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52092395) and returned
faulty Chinese coronavirus testing kits. The great political theorist
Niccolò Machiavelli considered a similar line of thinking in the 16th
century, about whether republics or dictators charted a more stable
course. He wrote, "I, therefore, disagree with the common opinion that a
populace in power is unstable \[and\] changeable ... The prince ...
unchecked by laws, will be more ... unstable, and imprudent than a
populace." The U.S. political system certainly has problems. But
democracy is the best machine ever invented for generating enormous
power, wealth, and prestige on the international stage.

### China Econ Declining

**China's economy declining -- markets plummeting, rising risk of
recession, and GDP decline**

[China\'s gigantic **services sector just contracted at the second
sharpest pace**]{.underline} on record as Covid lockdowns hit businesses
hard. The Caixin purchasing managers\' index, a closely-watched
indicator for assessing the state of the economy, plummeted to 36.2 in
April from 42 in March, according to a survey released by IHS Markit on
Thursday. A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while anything above
that gauge shows expansion. [The services sector accounts for more than
half of the nation\'s GDP and over 40% of its employment. And with
survey data showing China\'s manufacturing sector also shrinking last
month, the **world\'s second biggest economy went backwards in
April**.]{.underline} While conditions might improve this month as Covid
infections rates ease and officials try to limit the damage to the
economy, [large parts of Beijing have just been placed under tighter
restrictions and some economists are now forecasting that Chinese GDP
will decline in the second quarter.]{.underline} The nation\'s capital
has effectively shut down its largest district, Chaoyang, suspending
transportation within it and encouraging 3.5 million residents to work
from home as part of its latest effort to curb Covid-19 cases, local
authorities announced Wednesday. The nearly 6-point decline in services
activity in April was second only to the collapse in February 2020, when
China\'s economy came to a near standstill as it battled to contain the
initial coronavirus outbreak that started from Wuhan. In that month,
[the Caixin services PMI dived to 26.5 from 51.8 in
January.]{.underline} Businesses in the world\'s second largest economy
were already grappling with rising energy and raw material costs, when
Covid lockdowns hamstrung their operations further. [It has also become
harder for firms to pass the higher prices to consumers, because of the
impact Covid restrictions have having on customer demand. That has
translated to even lower employment.]{.underline} \"Some companies,
affected by the drop in orders, laid off workers to lower costs,\" said
Wang Zhe, senior economist for Caixin Insight Group. The measure for
employment in the services sector has been under 50 for four consecutive
months, the survey showed. The data came just hours after China reported
a steep drop in tourist spending for the Labor Day national holiday.
Tourist spending was only 64.7 billion yuan (\$9.8 billion) over the
five-day holiday, down 43% from the same period last year, according to
a statement by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism late Wednesday.
People made 160 million domestic tourist trips during the holiday, down
30% from a year earlier. The data again highlights how China\'s
zero-Covid policy has taken a heavy toll on its economy. On Saturday,
PMI surveys from the government indicated that both factory and
non-manufacturing activities slumped in April to their worst levels
since February 2020. \"Recent mobility trends suggest that China\'s
growth momentum deteriorated significantly in April,\" analysts from
Fitch Ratings wrote on Tuesday. They expect GDP to contract in the
second quarter, before output recovers in the second half. [Nomura
analysts also warned last month of a **rising risk of \"recession\"** in
the second quarter, as lockdowns, a shrinking property sector, and
slowing exports hit the economy hard.]{.underline} As the highly
transmissible Omicron variant spreads quickly in China, the country is
battling its worst outbreak in more than two years. So far, at least 27
Chinese cities are under full or partial lockdown, which could be
impacting up to 185 million residents across the country, according to
CNN\'s latest calculation. That includes Shanghai --- the nation\'s
leading financial center and a major manufacturing and shipping hub. The
city has been under a lockdown since March 28. Although authorities
started to lift some restrictions last month, more than 8 million
residents are still banned from leaving their residential compounds. The
Chinese government still adheres to its stringent zero-Covid policy more
than two years after the initial outbreak --- at a time when the rest of
the world is learning to live with Covid. The policy involves mandatory
mass testing and strict lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus.
[But **economic costs are rising.** Many economists have **downgraded
their China GDP growth targets** for this year, citing risks from the
zero-Covid policy. Last month, the International Monetary Fund lowered
its China growth forecast to 4.4%, well below the government\'s official
target of about 5.5%.]{.underline}

[China's stubborn battle to eradicate Omicron is raising the risk of a
serious economic crisis.]{.underline} Nearly [one-third of the
population is under some sort of lockdown]{.underline}, with shops shut
and factories struggling. Policy easing looks unavoidable, but with
benchmark yields dropping below U.S. Treasury bonds, so does capital
flight. The outbreak in Shanghai, where asymptomatic cases are running
at around 25,000 a day despite two weeks of rigorous lockdown, is
prompting other regions to impose draconian measures pre-emptively. At
least 373 million people in cities contributing to 40% of China's GDP
have been affected, a Nomura survey showed. Key indicators are already
reflecting the shock. Domestic sales of passenger cars fell over 10% in
March, per official data; an index tracking freight traffic in China
dropped by about 25% during the first week of April. China contained the
initial outbreak in 2020 quickly and resumed production, allowing its
manufacturing sector to tap export markets to revive growth after a
single quarter of contraction. Omicron is far more infectious, yet
Beijing aims to reproduce that result. Officials appear to be realising
that won't be easy. [With the war in Ukraine pushing up commodities
costs, and demand for Chinese exports cooling as inflation spikes in key
overseas markets]{.underline}, premier Li Keqiang this week warned of
"**[unexpected changes" in the external and domestic environment that

stimulus and infrastructure spending will be hard to implement during

**China' economy in freefall -- mismanagement, COVID, and external
factors make it damage beyond repair**

What if the new era of great-power competition was over before it had
even begun? Many of today's fears about a multigeneration conflict with
Beijing rest on linear extrapolations of yesteryear's data, harkening
back to a time when China appeared on track to supplant the United
States as the world's largest economy. Yet more and [more signs point to
a **China that is fully unprepared for the competition** with the United
States]{.underline} it once sought. [**China's economy, long in decline,
is now in freefall**---thanks to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's
mismanagement]{.underline}. Case in point: This year, [the U.S. economy
is forecast to grow faster than China's for the first time since
1976]{.underline}, with strong indications that China has entered a
prolonged era of slow growth. More surprising is that Xi, [in an attempt
to stabilize China's finances, has largely abandoned his ambitious plans
to overhaul China's growth model, choosing instead to double down on the
very economic policies that got China into today's economic bind in the
first place.]{.underline} Put differently, Xi blinked. [Xi's reversal
speaks volumes. It suggests he lacks confidence in his own plan to
transform China's unsustainable economic model into one that can deliver
on the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) promise of "high quality" growth.
More important is that China's fizzling economic miracle may soon
undercut the CCP's ability to wage a sustained struggle for geostrategic
dominance.]{.underline} This raises a tantalizing question: What if,
instead of being a competitor, China cannot actually afford to compete
at all? Xi is often said to have tapped into Chinese resentment over its
colonial-era humiliations to kick-start its modern-day competition with
the United States. But the decision to jettison China's policy of hiding
its capabilities and biding its time began much earlier. Indeed, for
decades before Xi's ascent into power, CCP elites made clear this dictum
would be discarded as soon as the international balance of power shifted
in China's favor. When Washington looked to be terminally weakened by
the 2008 financial crisis, Chinese officials made their move, betting
that overseas investments and economic coercion were the keys to
outcompeting the West. They were mostly right. China's economic clout,
beyond any other consideration, still serves as the foundation for the
country's vast influence. The gravitational pull of China's market,
along with Beijing's ability to influence economic conditions and shape
political perceptions in other countries, enabled China to bind itself
to the world. The fruits of China's economic expansion also underwrote
its power projection, covering the costs of the Belt and Road
Initiative, military modernization, and expanding multilateral
commitments. China's GDP growth paid domestic dividends for the CCP too,
empowering a model of state capitalism that broke down the barriers
between the private sector and government institutions to mobilize the
former in service of the latter. Nevertheless, China's meteoric rise,
fueled by annual GDP growth above 6 percent, appears over. Yes,
[**China's economy has been cooling for years**, plagued by systematic
deficiencies like chronic overinvestment, massive debt loads, and a
shrinking workforce, which has put enormous stresses on China's
finances. But these **systematic trends have been exacerbated, perhaps
irreversibly**, by China's disastrous pandemic response, where the lack
of an effective domestic vaccine and the CCP's unwillingness to approve
and purchase Western ones have made rolling lockdowns a permanent way of
life. So far, the CCP's containment measures have resulted in plummeting
industrial output, surging unemployment, capital flight, and a sinking
currency. **Efforts to stabilize the Chinese economy will be further
strained by a deteriorating external environment**,]{.underline} with
the World Bank warning of 1970s-style [stagflation and reduced global
demand for Chinese exports]{.underline}---until now, the engine of
China's growth. [The economy remains severely dependent on vast supplies
of imported fuel, grain, and other commodities whose prices have
massively surged]{.underline}. Western technology transfer restrictions
are also taking their toll. Another challenge is growing frustration in
China's largest markets---the United States and the European
Union---over Xi's support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Already,
[large multinational companies like Apple are shifting supply chains to
Southeast Asia and other regions perceived as more stable]{.underline}
while expatriates are abandoning the country and newly minted college
graduates flee in droves. Indeed, **[China's brain drain has
begun.]{.underline}** So far, Xi has offered few new ideas for remedying
China's crisis, even as his subordinates warn about the need to "act
decisively" to avoid financial ruin. Xi's big bet consists of an
"all-out" infrastructure push to boost the economy---the same approach
that fueled China's current debt bubble, massive industrial
overcapacity, and the creation of entire ghost cities of half-finished
apartments. But such investments are unlikely to stimulate China's
economy, not least because they are focused on propping up the least
productive parts of China's economy, including the state sector. Making
matters worse, Xi has offered little relief for Chinese consumers, the
linchpin in his effort to drum up domestic consumption, decrease
inequality, and reduce the economy's reliance on exports and
unproductive investments. Consumers were integral to China's pandemic
rebound in 2021 but now face growing fears about job security and
sustained income losses from never-ending lockdowns. At the same time,
one by one, Xi's signature economic initiatives have disappeared from
the front pages of China's state-owned newspapers. That includes Xi's
push for "common prosperity," which ostensibly aimed to reduce extreme
inequality by giving ordinary Chinese a greater share of the nation's
wealth. Plans to introduce a property tax to slow down China's notorious
real estate bubble---where the elite have amassed vast fortunes---have
also been shelved. Chinese regulators have also signaled an end to Xi's
crackdown on China's tech giants, whose growing influence has long been
viewed as a growing threat to the CCP's power. Nevertheless, foreign
investors, who lost billions of dollars on Chinese tech stocks tanked by
Xi's policies, remain wary. With many Western banks warning that the
regulatory risks of investing in China now outweigh the potential
benefits, these investors may not come to Beijing's rescue either. Mere
months before Xi's coronation to a third term as party secretary, [CCP
officials whose jobs it is to worry about economic growth, like Chinese
Premier Li Keqiang, are now openly pitted against Xi]{.underline} and
those more concerned with regime security and party control, such as
Chinese Vice Premiers Han Zheng and Hu Chunhua. While Xi projects calm
and warns citizens not to question his zero-COVID policies, [Li refuses
to endorse them and instead speaks of China's "complicated and grave"
situation.]{.underline} This fractured policy environment, where
ideological and technocratic factions battle for influence, is **[eerily
reminiscent of late Chinese leader Mao Zedong's era]{.underline}**. Just
as it did then, today's intraparty clash will produce winners and
losers. For now, the latter group includes Xi, who will probably be
forced to make key personnel concessions during this fall's 20th
National Party Congress to secure the support needed to guarantee a
third term. For the remainder of 2022, China's worsening domestic
challenges will remain the party's highest priority, and addressing them
will take up an increasing share of China's economic resources. The
upshot is that U.S.-China tensions will likely remain subdued, at least
for the short-to-medium term. China's state-owned enterprises,
provincial and local governments, private companies, and citizens will
be forced to compete for a piece of a pie that is no longer growing.
More difficult to predict, however, is how China's fight for resources
and power will affect the country's various domestic stakeholders. For
the first time in a while, China's state-owned enterprises, provincial
and local governments, private companies, and citizens will be forced to
compete for a piece of a pie that is no longer growing. As a result,
funding trade-offs will be necessary, including those considered
inconceivable when China's annual growth hovers around 10 percent. That
will include cuts to current and planned investments in China's power
projection capabilities, both civilian and military. Outbound Chinese
development loans, a key tool for Beijing to expand relations across
Asia and Africa, have already dropped 96 percent in recent years, from
\$75 billion in 2016 to approximately \$4 billion during the pandemic.
The overall average value of Belt and Road Initiative-related projects,
averaging \$255 billion annually between 2010 and 2019, also cratered to
less than \$81 billion in 2020. Although these figures may recover
slightly, Chinese policymakers will be hard pressed to justify such
expenditures as China's economy falters. Similar trade-offs will also be
necessary for certain aspects of China's defense spending. In a
contested resource environment, [tensions will almost certainly emerge
between China's army, navy, and domestic security
apparatus]{.underline}. The same goes for civil-military relations
because local officials are often expected to provide the military with
the materiel and support required for training and large-scale
exercises. Overtime, [China's **economic slowdown could also lead to
civil unrest**, which could force the military to become more involved
in maintaining domestic security]{.underline} at the expense of its
broader modernization. Potential economic constraints could also impede
plans to fully fund newly announced ventures, such as China's space
force. Over the long term, China could be forced to choose among certain
core missions, such as monitoring China's coast, building up its South
China Sea outposts, maintaining its air defense identification zone, and
even protecting its unruly borders. Either way, China's military will be
forced to do more with less. In the end though, China's [sustained
economic cooldown]{.underline} and Xi's crisis of confidence [will
result in the very outcome he, the CCP, and Chinese nationalists feared
most: broad recognition that China may be incapable of competing with
the United States at all.]{.underline}

As leaders of major Western democracies and their allies met in two
back-to-back summits this week in Europe, their focus was clear: keeping
pressure on Russia as its brutal assault on Ukraine enters its fifth
month. [But another country was also pulled into the spotlight in those
meetings: China. And Beijing is not happy about it.]{.underline} For the
first time, China was included in NATO\'s \"Strategic Concept,\" adopted
at the bloc\'s summit in Madrid on Wednesday[. The document, last
updated in 2010, lays out the security challenges facing the alliance
while outlining a course of action, and now says China\'s ambitions and
\"coercive policies\" challenge the allies\' interests, security and
values. The new language has prompted China to accuse NATO of being a
\"Cold War remnant.\"]{.underline} \"[The Strategic Concept claims that
other countries pose challenges, but it is NATO that is creating
problems around the world,\"]{.underline} China\'s Mission to the EU
said in a statement Wednesday. [\"We urge NATO to stop provoking
confrontation by drawing ideological lines, abandon the Cold War
mentality and zero-sum game approach, and stop spreading disinformation
and provocative statements against China]{.underline}. Since NATO
positions China as a \"systemic challenge,\" we have to pay close
attention and respond in a coordinated way,\" it said. Earlier this
week, the Group of Seven (G7) major democratic economies included tough
language on China in their own communique, released days after launching
an infrastructure investment plan to counter China\'s Belt and Road
Initiative. European leaders have grown increasingly wary of China in
recent years and those views have hardened over the past few months as
Beijing has repeatedly refused to condemn the Russian invasion of
Ukraine and bolstered its ties with the Kremlin. \"We see a deepening
strategic partnership between Moscow and Beijing. And China\'s growing
assertiveness and its coercive policies have consequences for the
security of Allies and our partners,\" NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg said at a news conference Wednesday. \"China is not our
adversary. But we must be clear-eyed about the serious challenges it
represents,\" he said. Differences still exist between countries in the
bloc on how to treat China, observers say. Some NATO members want to
ensure the focus remains squarely on Russia, while the United States \--
by far the block\'s most powerful member \-- has pegged China as the
\"most serious long-term challenge to the international order.\" But the
developments this week, which show China to be higher on these bodies\'
agendas than ever before, signal an increasing alignment between the US
and its partners. They also mark a significant setback for Beijing,
which has tried to drive a wedge between the American and European
stances on China, observers say. \"The combination of the kind of
language used by the G7 and (China\'s formal inclusion) in NATO
strategic documents is indeed a blow for (China), and something that
they would have hoped and wished to be able to prevent,\" said Andrew
Small, a senior transatlantic fellow in the Asia Program at The German
Marshall Fund of the United States. \"It\'s an exceptionally strong
period in terms of transatlantic cooperation and that translates for
China in ways that they\'re very concerned about,\" he said. China\'s
concerns have been clear this week, as its Foreign Ministry pushed back
on the NATO designation in regular scheduled press briefings. \"China
pursues an independent foreign policy of peace. It does not interfere in
other countries\' internal affairs or export ideology, still less engage
in long-arm jurisdiction, economic coercion or unilateral sanctions. How
could China be labeled a \'systemic challenge\'?\" ministry spokesperson
Zhao Lijian said on Tuesday. \"[We solemnly urge NATO to immediately
stop spreading false and provocative statements against China,\" he
said, adding that NATO should \"stop seeking to disrupt Asia and the
whole world after it has disrupted Europe.\"]{.underline} But that
rhetoric \-- blaming NATO for \"disruption\" in Europe \-- is part of
what is driving a shift in European perspectives, analysts say, as
Beijing has refused to condemn Russia\'s actions in Ukraine, including
the killing of civilians, while actively blaming the US and NATO for
provoking Moscow. [China \"very quickly and very clearly lined itself up
\-- at least in words, not so much in deeds \-- with
Russia,\"]{.underline} while transatlantic partners came together
against Russia and in support of Ukraine in the wake of the invasion,
said Pepijn Bergsen, a research fellow in the Europe Program at the
Chatham House think tank in London. [The contrast between the two has
helped drive an emerging \"democracies versus autocracies\" narrative in
Europe, he said, adding that internal politics also play a
role.]{.underline} \"In Eastern and Central Europe, where Russia is
regarded as by far the number one security threat, relations (with
China) had already been starting to fray, but the fact that China so
clearly lined up with Russia has accelerated a shift,\" Bergsen said.
China, for its part, appears to have underestimated the extent to which
its stance would reverberate through its relationship with Europe, one
that was already on shaky ground following European concerns over
alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, erosion of freedoms in Hong
Kong and China\'s economic targeting of Lithuania over the Baltic
nation\'s relations with Taiwan. That miscalculation was on show in a
terse summit between China and European Union leaders in April, where
China focused on talking points around deepening their relations and
economic cooperation, while EU officials were bent on pushing China to
work with it toward brokering peace in Ukraine. China has claimed
neutrality and that it supports peace, but has made no concrete steps in
that direction. [Rising concerns about China from the G7 \-- made up of
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the US \--
were reflected in the bloc\'s joint communique, released Tuesday after a
summit in German Bavaria. The document, which mentioned China around a
dozen times \-- versus four references in the G7 leaders\' statement a
year earlier \-- touched on areas of cooperation, but focused on calling
on China to improve its human rights record and abide by international
rules.]{.underline} And in a mark of how Russia has shaped the bloc\'s
view on China, the group called on Beijing to \"press\" Moscow to comply
with United Nations resolutions and stop its military aggression. The
statement followed what Washington called the \"formal launch\" on
Sunday of a \$600 billion G7 infrastructure investment initiative, first
announced last year. The drive, which the EU said would \"demonstrate
the power of development finance when it reflects democratic values,\"
was an apparent bid to counter China\'s flagship Belt and Road
Initiative, which critics say Beijing has used to build its global
influence. [At NATO, the newly adopted strategy document says China
\"employs a broad range of political, economic and military tools to
increase its global footprint and project power, while remaining opaque
about its strategy, intentions and military build-up.\" It also points
to a \"deepening strategic partnership\" between Russia and China and
says their \"mutually reinforcing attempts\" to undercut the rules-based
international order \"run counter\" to NATO values. The language, which
also saw Russia move from a \"strategic partner\" in the 2010 document
to \"the most significant and direct threat\" in the current iteration,
is a clear bolstering of NATO\'s stance.]{.underline} That\'s
significant not least of all because in recent years, as NATO statements
began to reference China, some members and observers raised concerns
that taking too firm a stance risked turning China into an enemy. Others
have seen China as outside the region\'s key security interests.
Following a NATO meeting last June, in which leaders characterized China
as a security challenge, French President Emmanuel Macron downplayed the
move with a quip that \"China is not in the North Atlantic.\" Some of
those concerns still exist, and inside the bloc there remain differences
in views on how to handle China, observers say. Within Europe, such
debates even extend to the emerging \"autocracies versus democracies\"
narrative being promoted by the US, according to Pierre Haroche, a
research fellow in European security at the Institute for Strategic
Research (IRSEM, Paris). \"[Do you want to solidify the \'dragon-bear
monster\' to show that there is a clear ideological \'Cold War\' between
democracies and autocracies, because that\'s convenient in terms of the
narrative? Or is it (a better) strategy to say that the two (China and
Russia) are very different actors \... who might even, in the future,
oppose one another]{.underline}?\" said Haroche, summarizing the
argument. But even as differences may exist between member states, it\'s
clear that NATO is thinking bigger at this year\'s summit, with the
historic inclusion of leaders from New Zealand, Australia, South Korea,
and Japan. [The move was met with ire in China, where officials have
long argued that NATO was seeking to expand its presence into the
Indo-Pacific, which Beijing views as its own neighborhood.]{.underline}
\"The sewage of the Cold War cannot be allowed to flow into the Pacific
Ocean - this should be the general consensus in the Asia-Pacific
region,\" a Tuesday editorial from the Communist Party-affiliated
nationalist tabloid Global Times said. But observers have characterized
this not so much as an expansion of NATO into the Indo-Pacific, but
rather a bid to strengthen relations between, in the NATO secretariat\'s
words, \"like-minded countries.\" Those democracies across the Pacific,
like their counterparts in Europe, may now be seeing the threats they
face as more connected, according to The German Marshall Fund\'s Small.
\"There is much more of a sense emerging from all of this, conditioned
by the China challenge, by the Russia challenge, that the democratic
allies have to be more effectively coordinated,\" he said.

### China Hege Decline Now

#### China in decline -- US must maintain force and hege to contain aggressive and violent policies of China. 

**Brands '22** (Hal Brands. Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished Professor

Studies (SAIS) and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \"The
Dangers of China\'s Decline as a Great Power\". April 14, 2022. Foreign
Policy. https://archive.ph/1Rt7v. 7-1-2022.)-cg

[Decline is a tricky concept]{.underline}. The term makes us think of a
country that is falling like a rock---one whose power and capabilities
are dropping across the board. [But a country can be in relative decline
vis-à-vis a fast-growing adversary even if its own power is still
increasing. It can be surging forward in some areas, such as military
might, even as its underlying economic strength starts to wither. And
decline doesn't always lead a country to scale back its objectives---the
sense of urgency it creates can cause ambitious powers to grab what they
can before the clock runs out.]{.underline} Xi Jinping's China is about
to give the world an education in the nuances of decline. [Since the
onset of its economic reforms in the 1970s, China has long defied
predictions that it would soon stumble or collapse. Its spectacular
growth challenged prevailing views about the sources of national success
in the modern world. In some ways, China is still soaring: Its military
power grows more formidable every year]{.underline}. When Xi declares
that "the East is rising and the West is declining," he gives voice to
this sense that China is a country on the make. [Yet military power is
often a lagging indicator of a country's trajectory: It takes time to
turn money into military muscle, and massive buildups often persist even
after a country's economic fortunes begin to flag. And today, for
reasons including demographic disaster and the lingering effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic, China is facing the end of the stunning economic
growth that made it possible for Xi to assert that the "great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation" was at hand. The China of the 2020s
will be a country whose coercive capabilities are more intimidating than
ever as its economic dynamism fades.]{.underline} That could be the
worst possible combination for the world. Any country that rises as
impressively as China is bound to make fools of some prophets of decline
along the way. In recent decades, Beijing has repeatedly confounded
those who predicted it was about to hit the wall. In the aftermath of
Mao Zedong's death, some Western observers were skeptical that China---a
country that U.S. diplomat George Kennan once called a "vast
poorhouse"---could put together the policies necessary for sustained
growth. After the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, it was common to
wonder whether the resulting political crackdown would stifle the
country's prosperity. Through the early 2000s, social scientists and
U.S. officials predicted that China could be rich or autocratic---but
not both. A few prominent analysts made careers for themselves by
heralding China's collapse. It hasn't happened---yet. From 1978 to the
onset of the global financial crisis three decades later, China's
constant-dollar GDP grew by a factor of 17, without the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) losing control. That growth enabled the
decades-long military buildup and sprawling economic influence that made
China a force to be feared on the global stage. As Tufts University's
Michael Beckley and I argue in our forthcoming book, Danger Zone: The
Coming Conflict With China, this economic miracle required good luck and
good policy. China seemed to have hit the demographic jackpot in the
1980s and 1990s; the unlikely combination of warfare and famine in the
1930s and 1940s, a regime-sponsored baby boom after the CCP took power,
and then the institution of the one-child policy in 1980 left the
country with a huge working-age population unencumbered by lots of young
or old dependents. China was nearly self-sufficient in food, water, and
other resources. And it had the fortuitous timing to start its reforms
as globalization went into overdrive, making it easier to integrate the
country into complex supply chains and thereby make China the workshop
of the world. Good policies were also crucial. Mao's one-man rule and
economic illiteracy had condemned China to serial, self-created
disasters. Once he died, Deng Xiaoping and his successors moved toward a
"socialist market economy." They opened China to trade and investment,
overhauled the tax and regulatory systems, shrank bloated state-owned
enterprises, and encouraged private business. Accompanying political
reforms limited the power of China's rulers and enlarged the space for
nonideological competence within the regime. The CCP relaxed its grip
enough to permit economic spontaneity---and reaped the benefits in the
form of prosperity that reinforced its political control. China's
ascendance shook the world intellectually as well as geopolitically: It
undermined post-Cold War Western beliefs that prosperity would lead
inevitably to political liberalization, that democracies produced higher
rates of growth than autocracies, and that tyranny was incompatible with
sound economic management. As China became a global heavyweight, a new
orthodoxy solidified---that a hegemonic transition was approaching as
Beijing surpassed the United States. One dissenter was the political
scientist David Shambaugh. In 2015, [Shambaugh argued that China was
suffering from a deep internal malaise and that Xi's increasingly
repressive rule was a sign of insecurity, not confidence. "\[F\]or all
the Western views of it as an unstoppable juggernaut," he wrote, China's
economy "is stuck in a series of systemic traps from which there is no
easy exit." Shambaugh struck a discordant note at a time when Beijing
was tightening its control of the South China Sea and spreading its
influence across multiple continents. He also happened to be right. Not
least of the oddities surrounding contemporary China is that much of the
world deemed its ascent inevitable just as its prospects started to
dim.]{.underline} This may sound absurd, given all the hype surrounding
China's rise. After all, that country is supposedly destined, as the
Harvard University political scientist Graham Allison (channeling
legendary Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew) has written, to
become "the biggest player in the history of the world." It's true that
China does boast many apparent advantages. It has an enormous domestic
market and is the leading trade partner of roughly 130 countries around
the world. It is making concerted investments in artificial intelligence
(AI), semiconductors, and other critical technologies. [If the United
States doesn't up its game, a national commission chaired by former
Google CEO Eric Schmidt warned in 2021, China could become the premier
"AI superpower." But look closer, and China's trajectory starts to seem
more tenuous.]{.underline} [For one thing, many of China's technological
achievements are narrower and less impressive than they first appear.
For example, Beijing has made great strides in AI applications focused
on surveillance (no surprise there), but the United States still leads
significantly across the wider expanse of AI subfields and uses. Despite
vast state subsidies, China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International
Corp. is years behind in the creation of cutting-edge semiconductors
that make up the foundation of advanced economies in the information
age.]{.underline} Just this year, Peking University published a candid
assessment---which the CCP then predictably censored---of China's
progress in science and technology. The verdict was that China is
"following \[the United States\] in most fields, running side by side in
a few, and leading in very few." And while China's other strengths are
not illusory, neither can they hide a reality that Beckley and I
discussed last year: The magic that made China's economic miracle is
unmistakably fizzling. The country's resource abundance is old news:
Overuse devastated much of China's arable land; industrialization and
pollution left the country with severe water scarcity. More damaging
still, China's abundance of human resources is also a thing of the past.
The one-child policy was a devil's bargain that is now causing
demographic implosion. China's total population is set to peak by 2028
(or perhaps as soon as this year, by some estimates) and then plummet by
as much as half by century's end. Its working population crested in
2015; it will fall by 70 million between 2020 and 2035 and even faster
after that. China will soon combine an enormous geriatric population
with a rapidly shrinking workforce. It will experience one of the worst
peacetime demographic crunches on record, a formula for stagnation at
best and catastrophic economic contraction at worst. [Making matters
worse, the era of enlightened economic policy is over. The reform agenda
has been stalled for more than a decade because further
liberalization---necessary to make the leap to a more innovative,
knowledge-based economy---would threaten the privileges of entrenched
elites.]{.underline} If anything, Xi has thrown the country into
reverse. [Politically, he is taking China into neototalitarianism
through pervasive repression and indoctrination. And economically, his
policies have a decidedly retrograde feel]{.underline}. Xi's agenda has
featured a preference for state-owned enterprises at the expense of the
more vibrant private sector; the imposition of severe, politically
motivated restrictions on wide swaths of the economy; attacks on the
autonomy of relatively technocratic institutions such as the central
bank; and the empowerment of political minders in companies of nearly
all sizes[. China's leaders may talk about the need to transition to a
high-tech, services-based economy, but Xi's policies are stifling the
competence, creativity, and spontaneity necessary to make that
shift]{.underline}. It all constitutes a "great leap backward"---a
reversion to pre-Deng-era policies that condemned China to stagnation.
There is also the question of what Xi's consolidation of power means for
the country's long-term resilience. [As the political theorist Francis
Fukuyama has written, for nearly 40 years after Mao's death China
avoided the "bad emperor" problem---the worst pathologies that accompany
authoritarian rule---by imposing term limits on its rulers and making
them more accountable to other CCP elites. Yet Xi has systematically
disassembled this system by purging rivals, sidelining potential
successors, and entrenching himself in power. By doing so, he is
enabling China to move faster and more decisively. But he is also
leaving the country vulnerable to impulsive or unwise
decision-making---a perpetual problem of one-man rule---and creating the
potential for terrible instability when his reign finally
ends.]{.underline} Xi's centralization of authority, while seemingly
impressive, is setting the country up for a fall. [Finally, it doesn't
help that a more assertive China is now facing more international
resistance]{.underline}. Trade barriers against Chinese companies and
products proliferated in the decade after the global financial crisis.
Washington has waged a technological cold war against Huawei, seeking to
deprive that Chinese firm of high-end semiconductors and keep it out of
the world's 5G networks. [Dozens of countries are more carefully
scrutinizing their economic, financial, and technological ties with
Beijing; the Japanese government is offering to pay companies to reduce
their China exposure. China is still central to the global economy, but
the days when the United States and other powerful countries eagerly
abetted its ascent are over. I]{.underline}ndeed, Xi's effort to
cultivate the domestic market is an implicit admission that China, which
rose on the strength of an export-focused economy, now confronts a very
different world. China's predicament has been thrown into relief,
ironically, by COVID-19. Early on, the pandemic seemed to herald an
epochal global shift. Prominent U.S. analysts saw it as a "Suez moment,"
the terminal crisis of the U.S. empire. Xi touted his regime's success
in containing COVID-19 at home (albeit after allowing it to escape to
the world) as an advertisement for Chinese authoritarianism. Two years
later, it's clear that COVID-19 was a turning point but not in the way
that Xi hoped. [The pandemic hypercharged global anti-China sentiment,
after Beijing concealed the initial outbreak and then exploited the
resulting chaos to bully nations from Australia to Germany and the
United Kingdom.]{.underline} [It thereby encouraged a host of
efforts---through multilateral institutions such as the Quadrilateral
Security Dialogue, AUKUS, and the G-7, as well as the United States'
bilateral alliances in the Pacific---to counter Chinese
power]{.underline}. "A Cold War mentality" had reemerged, a spokesperson
for China's foreign ministry complained, as the United States and its
friends pursued "anti-China encirclement." COVID-19 also confirmed how
patchy China's rise had been: [The country's biotechnology sector
couldn't produce anything like the revolutionary vaccines that
democratic innovation economies in the United States and Europe churned
out. Even China's heavy-handed success in containing COVID-19 at home
became a trap: The combination of "zero-COVID" policies, low levels of
natural immunity, and vaccines that proved weak or worthless against
highly contagious variants condemned the country to recurring lockdowns
of major cities, with all the accompanying disruptions.]{.underline}
Even before COVID-19, in fact, China's economic vital signs were
worrying. [The government claimed a growth rate of 6 percent, but
Chinese insiders and academic research indicate that the true number is
considerably lower---and even that growth is inflated by the relentless
injection of capital into a less and less efficient economy. As a
result, overall debt grew eightfold between 2008 and the end of 2020,
reaching 335 percent of GDP]{.underline}. In other countries, this
combination of slumping productivity and growing debt usually presages
sharp crises that turn into lasting economic quagmires. Xi's Chinese
dream involves catching up to the United States. In reality, his country
is slowing down. China is not, however, slowing down in all areas at
once. This isn't unusual: [The Soviet Union hit the apex of its military
power in the 1980s, when its economy was in a death spiral. In the early
20th century, Britain ruled a global empire at a time when its economic
supremacy had already slipped away. Today, China is stagnating
economically, but its drive for world power is
accelerating.]{.underline} Chinese leaders and propaganda organs now
openly tout the country's designs: In the coming decades, the official
state news agency Xinhua proclaimed, China will "re-ascend to the top of
the world." Beijing is creating new international organizations and
co-opting others. Its marquee projects, namely the Belt and Road
Initiative and the Digital Silk Road, aim to project economic and
political influence across Eurasia and beyond. China also fashions
itself as an ideological role model for other countries: Its style of
governance, Xi has said, offers a "new option for other countries and
nations that want to speed up their development while preserving their
independence." Most notably, China is building and wielding the tools of
geopolitical coercion. Countries such as Australia, Lithuania, Norway,
and South Korea have felt China's economic bite after they opposed its
policies or criticized its internal practices. Chinese military
spending---having already grown tenfold in real terms between 1990 and
2016---continues to rise, funding a dramatic expansion of the
capabilities needed to conquer Taiwan, overawe Beijing's neighbors, and
perhaps even take on the United States in the Western Pacific. The
statistics are simply astounding: Beijing put as many ships to sea from
2014 to 2018 as were in the navies of Britain, Germany, India, Spain,
and Taiwan combined. [And having long avoided a nuclear arms race with
Washington, Beijing is now sprinting forward and could be the United
States' nuclear peer by the 2030s. Threats to use force against enemies
have also become ubiquitous: Anyone who obstructs China's plans, Xi
warned in 2021, will "have their heads bashed bloody against the Great
Wall of Steel."]{.underline} It is sometimes hard to believe that such a
country is running out of gas. But perhaps China's strategic urgency is
increasing because its economic outlook has turned grim. [China's "hide
and bide" strategy---the approach it followed for a generation under
Deng and after---was one of patient confidence. If time was on a rising
Beijing's side, then it made sense to gradually build the country's
power and delay confrontation with the United States. Today, China's
strategic mindset is darker and more insistent.]{.underline} In many
areas, Xi acknowledges, "the West is strong, and the East is weak."
[China must race to make itself "invincible" so that "nobody can beat us
or choke us to death." What the United States will face in this decade,
then, is a China whose ability to batter its enemies and challenge the
global order is growing, even as leaner economic times loom ahead. This
China is unlikely to be benign or peaceful]{.underline}. History has
seen many once ascendant countries lash out violently rather than accept
a disappointing future as a second-tier power. [This fear is what led
Germany to take the risks that helped ignite World War I. It prompted
Japan to undertake the expansionist rampage that helped bring on World
War II. Xi has grand ambitions, from capturing Taiwan to establishing
China's primacy in Asia and, eventually, the world. If he loses faith
that the patient accumulation of economic power will bring Beijing these
rewards, he may become more inclined to take risks and use China's
coercive tools to secure them instead]{.underline}. This means that the
task of dealing with China could prove quite ticklish in the years
ahead. [The United States can't simply rest easy, confident that a
peaking China will fade away. Instead, it will have to rapidly firm up
its defenses in places where an impatient Beijing might lunge for
advantage, such as the Western Pacific. The United States and its allies
will have to join forces to prevent China from weaponizing its still
considerable economic and technological leverage to fracture the
anti-Beijing coalitions now taking shape. And they will have to ensure,
through multilateral control measures as well as investments in their
own capabilities, that the democratic world maintains its edge in
semiconductors and other critical technologies that will shape the
future balance of economic and military power]{.underline}. Yet
Washington and its friends will also have to do all this while keeping
channels of communication open and not unnecessarily provoking an
anxious China that may lash out as its predicament worsens. After all,
power and pessimism can make a deadly mix. The hardest sort of China to
handle may be one that is strong and weak at the same time.

### Russia-China Already Allied

[Rivals for centuries, China and Russia now have a partnership that has
"no limits,"]{.underline} Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin said
in early February. The [energy, military and political ties nurtured
over the past decade between the world's two most powerful authoritarian
states --- both of which aim to upend at least parts of the
US-dominated, post-Cold War order --- have aroused growing concern among
democratic leaders from Washington to Tokyo]{.underline}. Just weeks
after the joint statement, when Russia invaded Ukraine, China refused to
condemn the move. Still, the support Beijing has shown its ally since
has been anything but boundless. [The rapprochement was driven by a
common alienation from America that deepened after the 2003 US-led
invasion of Iraq and became increasingly overt after the 2008 financial
crisis, which originated in the US. Both states concluded that the
meltdown would undercut faith globally in the US economic and political
model. They increased ties cautiously until 2014, when Russia's
annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula triggered sanctions and a
definitive break between Russia and the wider West. That forced Moscow
to look for new partners and especially new markets for its energy
exports. China was a good fit, proving a massive and fast-growing buyer
of Russian commodities and weapons. The two states also share a deep
hostility toward US alliances in what they consider their own rightful
spheres of influence.]{.underline} For Russia, that's the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization in Europe; for China, it's Washington's network of
bilateral defense treaties in the Indo-Pacific region. Though short of a
formal, treaty-based alliance, the partnership between China and Russia
has been enhanced by a strong personal bond between Putin and Xi.
Products of tough childhoods, both men have evinced a determination to
crush dissent at home and restore their nations to greatness, ending
their perceived humiliation by the US and Europe. They have met more
than 30 times, making dumplings together in Tianjin and pancakes in
Vladivostok. In 2019, Xi called Putin his "best friend." In a joint
statement in February, they spelled out their shared contempt for
Western ideas of democracy. They defined democracy without reference to
elections, independent courts or free media and said it was about
economic development, with all models for public political participation
equally valid. In the 1800s, Russia was among European powers that
imposed so-called unequal treaties on China's Qing dynasty, including
one ceding the territory where the Russian city Vladivostok sits today.
Relations improved dramatically for a short period after Mao Zedong led
China's Communist Party to power in 1949, finding a natural ally in
Josef Stalin. But Mao opposed the political reforms known as
de-Stalinization that followed the Soviet leader's 1953 death and, in
1961, he split from Moscow. In 1969, the two countries fought a brief
border war over disputed territories and, in 1972, China did the
unthinkable by turning toward the US. It wasn't until the mid-1980s,
when Mikhail Gorbachev took charge in the Kremlin, that relations began
to thaw again. [Since 2014, Russia has sold China some of its most
advanced weapons systems, including \$5 billion worth of S-400
anti-aircraft missile systems and SU-35 attack jets]{.underline}. Within
two months of Crimea's annexation, Russia's Gazprom PJSC signed a deal
it said was worth about \$400 billion to supply China with natural gas
through a pipeline called the Power of Siberia. A second pipeline deal
has been struck since. [In addition, the two countries have increasingly
coordinated their positions at the United Nations Security Council,
where both wield vetoes. The growing cooperation between China and
Russia has led some policy makers in the US to fear that the country
could be forced to fight wars on two fronts, for example if Russia were
to threaten an American ally in Europe to distract the US during a
confrontation with China over Taiwan.]{.underline} US Senator Jim Inhofe
argued last year that, adjusted for purchasing power parity, the two
nations combined spend more on defense than the US. [There's a wider
concern that the combination of economic, military and political muscle
the two can muster is emboldening other world leaders with autocratic
tendencies, undermining confidence in democracy as a political system,
and threatening the version of the rules-based international order
promoted by the US and its allies since the end of the Cold War. China
avoided criticizing the invasion, blamed the US and NATO for the
conflict, and bought Russian oil that was being shunned by some other
countries, indirectly funding Moscow's war machine. But Xi proved
reluctant to unequivocally back the war or help Russia cushion the
financial impact of US and European Union sanctions.]{.underline} With a
gross domestic product almost eight times the size of Russia's, China
has substantially more at stake in a global economy that's still
dominated by the US and other developed democracies.

#### Chinese Russian relations have been great since 2014 -- invasion of Crimea and decline of the west

**Taylor and Shullman 22** (Andrea Kendall-Taylor is a Senior Fellow and
Director of the Transatlantic Security Program, Center for New American
Security and David O. Shullman is a Senior Director of the Global China
Hub, Atlantic Council. "Best and Bosom Friends: Why China-Russia Ties
Will Deepen after Russia's War on Ukraine," 6-22-22,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/best-and-bosom-friends-why-china-russia-ties-will-deepen-after-russias-war-ukraine)ZK

Previous [Russian aggression in Ukraine has been a catalyst]{.underline}
for deepening Russia-China relations. [Russia's illegal annexation of
Crimea in 2014 significantly accelerated the]{.underline} slow [warming
of the relationship that started in the waning days of the Cold
War]{.underline}. Convinced that it had no real economic opportunities
in the West, [the Kremlin turned to China for help in offsetting Western
pressure.]{.underline} At that time, China's initial support for Moscow
was tepid. Beijing was vaguely critical of the West for supposedly
causing the crisis, and it never verbally supported
[Russia]{.underline}n annexation, abstained on key UN resolutions, and
[allowed Chinese firms to abide by U.S. and European
sanctions.]{.underline} China also took advantage of Russia's increased
economic dependence to drive a hard bargain on key energy deals. Yet
[Beijing]{.underline} eventually [leaned into its partnership with
Russia]{.underline}. While Moscow's need to diversify away from the West
energized relations, [Beijing]{.underline} also [came around to
recognize the utility in building a stronger relationship with the
Kremlin]{.underline}. In particular, the China-Russia partnership
crystallized around a fundamentally similar view of the United States as
a primary strategic threat. Both Xi and Putin view U.S. support for
democracies in their regions---and for those fighting repression and
authoritarianism inside China and Russia---as an effort to extend
influence and ultimately overthrow their regimes. The leaders also view
the U.S. alliance network---including the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the Quad grouping in the Indo-Pacific---as a
direct challenge to their security and to their regimes. In the wake of
2014, these views hardened, especially as both countries' relations with
the United States grew more adversarial. Moreover, [Xi and
Putin]{.underline} have noted the increasing challenges facing Western
democracies and [have grown more confident that the United States and
the West are in decline]{.underline}. They therefore view the time as
ripe to challenge the U.S.-dominated global order and alliance network
and hasten Washington's retrenchment from their respective peripheries.
Both also expect the United States to do everything in its power to hold
onto its superpower status, particularly in the face of China's rise,
including coercing its allies to take actions against their own
interests. [Russia and China's deepening alignment since
2014]{.underline}, along with the complementarity of their needs and
capabilities, [has fueled growing ties across **all dimensions** of
their partnership.]{.underline} In the economic sphere, for example,
China's share of Russia's [external trade doubled from 10 to 20 percent
between 2013 and 2021]{.underline}. Their partnership deepened **[most
notably in the defense domain]{.underline}** and in their [common
crusade against democracy and the universality of human
rights.]{.underline} Arms sales and technical cooperation have grown, as
have the frequency, scope, and complexity of their joint military
exercises. In the democracy domain, Moscow and Beijing together are
popularizing authoritarian governance, exporting their best practices,
watering down human rights norms, backing each other up in multilateral
forums, creating norms around cyber and internet sovereignty, and
bolstering illiberal leaders. Despite these developments since 2014,
China is once again treading carefully in the aftermath of Russia's
reinvasion of Ukraine. China has abstained from voting on key UN
resolutions, and Chinese firms are tentative about maintaining
operations with Russia, given their desire to avoid secondary sanctions.
The key difference, reflecting the much deeper starting point of their
relationship going into this crisis, has been China's far stronger
rhetorical support for Russia. Senior Chinese officials not only
indicated support for the Kremlin's "reasonable security concerns" about
potential NATO expansion as a justification for its initial actions but
have since doubled down on pledges to deepen ties with Russia, parroting
Russian talking points about its actions in Ukraine and the culpability

account for nearly half of the estimated \$15.7 trillion that AI will
add to the global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030, and almost
double the expected growth in North America.23 AI's economic benefits
are undeniable, but AI competition with China goes beyond GDP growth and

### Russia Alliance Turn

#### The more Russia loses (the aff), the more China will support them. Worst case, everything is balanced. 

**Blanchette 22** (Jude Blanchette holds the Freeman chair in China
studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, "The
worse things go for Putin in Ukraine, the more China will back him," The
Washington Post, March 24, 2022 at 4:09 p.m. EDT,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/24/xi-jinping-putin-china-russia-sanctions/>) -
MP

China has tried to have it both ways since Russia invaded Ukraine a
month ago. It abstained from key votes at the United Nations criticizing
Russia's actions, avoided directly labeling President Vladimir Putin's
assault on Ukraine an "invasion," amplified Russian disinformation and
repeatedly laid blame for the war at the feet of the United States and
NATO. At the same time, Beijing has also largely complied with sanctions
against Russia, made repeated, if vague, calls for a negotiated
settlement to the hostilities and provided humanitarian assistance to
Ukraine. But make no mistake: [The worse it goes for Russia in Ukraine,
the more China will step up its support for the Putin regime. Beijing's
uneven diplomatic strategy may seem to stem from a desire to achieve
multiple, often conflicting aims, most notably to forestall a
deterioration in relations with Europe.]{.underline} Not all objectives
are weighted equally, however, and as the war enters a more protracted
and destructive phase, [China's primary goal is coming into focus: to
ensure that Russia retains its status as Beijing's key strategic
partner, even if this necessitates paying serious economic and
diplomatic costs. Beijing will see the prospect of a Russian defeat as a
direct threat to its own territorial security and ability to compete
head-to-head in the geopolitical rivalry with the United
States]{.underline} --- and China simply can't allow that to happen. To
see why Beijing has a direct stake in the war's outcome, it's critical
to understand how its relationship with Russia has evolved since the
collapse of the Soviet Union, and how China views the global security
environment evolving over the next three to five years. Since the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, China and Russia
have experienced significant friction and mutual mistrust. The nadir of
the relationship came in 1969, when the two communist powers nearly
engaged in a nuclear war. Since 1989, however, Beijing and Moscow have
systematically addressed the major points of contention in their
relationship, including any lingering territorial disputes. In 2001, the
countries signed the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly
Cooperation, and after Chinese leader Xi Jinping assumed power in 2013,
cooperation has expanded to include joint military exercises, efforts to
reform global governance and technology sharing[. For example, the two
countries continue to develop a satellite navigation system to rival the
United States' GPS, and in January, Russia and China, along with Iran,
held a series of naval drills in the Indian Ocean]{.underline}. This
growing symbiosis was formalized on Feb. 4 in a joint statement issued
during Putin's visit to Beijing at the start of the Winter Olympics
(Xi's meeting with Putin then was his first with a world leader since
February 2020, when he appeared with the Mongolian prime minister in
Beijing). Stretching more than 5,000 words, the joint statement
encapsulated a shared worldview between two authoritarian powers and two
autocratic leaders. The global order is undergoing "momentous changes,"
the statement read, which include a "transformation of the global
governance architecture and world order" and "global challenges and
threats growing from day to day." But perhaps more important, the joint
statement articulated a shared grievance that the United States and its
allies threaten Chinese and Russian interests and global aspirations.
NATO, the document states, promotes an "ideologized cold war approach,"
while the U.S. "Indo-Pacific strategy" endangers the "peace and
stability in the region." [Before Russia had even invaded Ukraine, then,
Beijing had come to see Moscow as a critical security and strategic
partner in the growing power rivalry with the United States and its
allies in Europe and Asia]{.underline}. More to the point, Russia is
China's only real military and strategic partner. Although tensions
exist in the bilateral relationship, not least because of the growing
economic gap between their economies, the broader geopolitical
chessboard draws Moscow and Beijing together. What's more, [Putin and Xi
have a close relationship --- they've met in person or virtually nearly
40 times in the decade that Xi has been in power. Time is running out
for China The war in Ukraine has undoubtedly thrown Beijing off balance,
and Chinese officials certainly didn't want Putin to invade in the first
place, but the basic math underlying this strategic partnership with
Moscow has not changed]{.underline}. Indeed, the war has only
consolidated Beijing's central logic for supporting Russia, given the
recent demonstration of Western diplomatic unity, the overwhelming power
of U.S.-led sanctions and the reinvigoration of NATO. The former editor
of the Chinese nationalist Global Times newspaper, Hu Xijin, argued in
recent commentary that ["if the U.S. pursues extreme strategic coercion
against China, with Russia as a partner, China will not fear a U.S.
energy blockade, our food supplies will be more secure, as will \[our
supplies\] of many other raw materials]{.underline}." In a speech last
weekend, China's vice foreign minister Le Yucheng drew a straight line
between NATO in Europe and China's own security concerns, warning that
just as Moscow's actions in Ukraine were a direct consequence of NATO
expansion, any actions by NATO in the Asia-Pacific region would provoke
similar consequences, and thus, the "crisis in Ukraine is a stern
warning." Beyond the substantive reasons underlying China's support for
Russia, there is also Beijing's unwillingness to be seen as submitting
to the U.S. demand that it back away from Moscow. As one Chinese Russia
expert at the Shanghai International Studies University observed, "If
China goes along with the U.S. against Russia, it will not only greatly
strengthen the anti-Russian camp, but will also be a huge boost to the
U.S. 'leadership.' " The key question now is just how far Beijing will
go to support Moscow. While Xi would like to maintain good relations
with Europe and avoid a further deterioration in the U.S.-China
relationship, [the fate of Putin and the Russian state directly
implicates China's core security interests.]{.underline} Not only would
the prospect of a beaten and broken Russia activate China's fears of
instability along their shared 2,500-mile border, but it would also
create uncertainty about the future leadership and geopolitical
orientation of the Russian government. If Putin were eventually to fall
from power, would his successor remain aligned with Beijing? So the more
anxious Beijing becomes about the war and Putin's personal position in
power, the more likely it is to step up support by providing direct
economic assistance, mitigating the impact of sanctions and even
supplying military equipment. Clearly, China's preference is to avoid
secondary sanctions in response to any support --- access to the
international market and the U.S. dollar remains critical for China's
economy and its continued rise. [But Beijing could pursue means of
support that are difficult to track, such as facilitating Russia's
access to U.S. dollars via offshore accounts, or by directing
state-owned enterprises and even private companies to increase their
purchases of non-sanctioned Russian goods and services]{.underline}. If
[China]{.underline} does decide to supply Russia with military
assistance, it [would likely seek to avoid equipment and hardware that
would flagrantly violate international law and sanctions or be easily
traceable, and instead provide spare parts, ammunition or certain
dual-use items that aren't yet sanctioned]{.underline}. But critically,
the decision to provide aid to Russia would be driven primarily by
Beijing's assessment of how Russia is faring in the war, rather than a
desire to avoid paying economic or diplomatic costs. Unfortunately, it
is difficult to imagine that Beijing is watching the conflict unfold
without growing more nervous by the day: Russia has failed to achieve
any of its major military or political objectives. In just the past
week, the Russian military has escalated its offensive to include a
wider number of indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets, and
President Biden is also now warning of "clear signs" that Putin is
considering using chemical weapons. Domestically, Putin has begun to
purge his inner circle, arresting some within the security services and
senior officials in the national guard. Beijing will see this as a sign
that Putin's grip is weakening, and as the sanctions continue to
decimate Russia's economy, anxiety in China is only likely to grow.
Succession plans protect nations. Putin and Xi just threw theirs out.
[Some analysts suggest that China may well see Russia's recent weakening
in the wake of sanctions as a net positive, as it shifts the balance of
power in the relationship in Beijing's favor]{.underline}. A tangible
benefit of such a shift would be Beijing's ability to demand more
favorable terms in buying Russian energy. While it's true that Beijing
leveraged Moscow's economic and diplomatic isolation after Russia
annexed Crimea in 2014 to gain better terms in several large energy
deals, the security environment for China in 2022 is far more
contentious than it was in 2014, and Moscow's true value is its
ideological orientation and military capabilities as much as its energy
stores. Xi does not want a weak Russia for a security and strategic
partner. If Beijing turns toward and not away from Moscow as the war
grinds on and the extent of human suffering increases, the basic
trajectory of [China's relations with the West will undergo a profound
shift toward open rivalry]{.underline}. It would be comforting to think
that [the prospect of such a disastrous turn would be enough to dissuade
the Chinese leadership from traveling down this path]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, though, [Beijing's geopolitical outlook for the next
decade]{.underline} --- much like Washington's --- [includes conflict
and friction as defining features.]{.underline}

## Growth Impact Answers

### Growth Resilient

#### Chinese growth is resilient -- reforms ensure that small dips won't stick

**Liu 16** -- (Chinese ambassador to the UK, "The Chinese economy is
still full of power", 2/27/16,
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/12175115/The-Chinese-economy-is-still-full-of-power.html)//EO

A glass is filled halfway with water. Pessimists would say it's half
empty, while optimists would say it's half full. The same is true when
it comes to the Chinese economy. Quite a few [pessimists]{.underline}
have been forecasting doom and gloom since the beginning of the year.
However, they have [fail]{.underline}ed [to see the country's resilience
and the new driving forces that have emerged. In fact, [the recent
moderation in China's growth is the anticipated result of reform
measures and
regulation](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/02/26/ftse-100-extends-gains-and-china-rebounds-as-finance-ministers-g/).
This is therefore the "new normal"]{.underline}: we are seeing slower
yet better quality growth helped along by proactive and deeper reforms.
Of course, [China's growth rate could easily have exceeded 7 per cent if
the energy- and- pollution-intensive industries had been given free
rein,]{.underline} or if massive stimulus measures had been applied.
[China, however, chose not to opt for this kind of unsustainable growth
-- because it would come with a huge cost and would sacrifice the
long-term development of China and the world]{.underline}. Instead,
China has chosen to focus on the following five key areas: addressing
excess capacity, downsizing property inventories, expanding effective
supply, helping enterprises reduce cost and guarding against financial
risks. This approach, like losing weight, won't be without its
discomforts or pain. But just as perseverance will see one through a
diet -- to less fat, stronger muscles and a healthier body -- so it is
with the Chinese economy. [Despite the moderation in growth, the
fundamentals of the Chinese economy remain strong. While the stock and
foreign exchange markets have their own patterns, the key is to look at
the bigger picture. It is true that the 6.9 per cent growth in 2015 was
the lowest for China in 25 years. But this was achieved by an economy
that is 10 trillion dollars in size.]{.underline} The actual increment
is equivalent to the yearly GDP of a medium-sized country and it is
larger than the amount generated by double-digit growth years ago. In
other words, [against the background of the sluggish world economy,
China remains one of the fastest-growing major economies -- and it
contributes over one quarter of global growth]{.underline}. Consumption
now accounts for two thirds of China's growth and the service sector now
makes up more than half of GDP. [China's solid material foundation,
abundant human resources and vast market potential will continue to
provide a sound basis and condition for sustained economic
growth]{.underline}. The gap between the eastern and western regions,
and between the urban and rural areas, indicates ample spaces and
untapped potentials for further development. Moreover, the ongoing
process of new industrialisation, IT application, urbanisation and
agricultural modernisation is generating strong driving forces for
growth. China's fiscal deficit and government debt is also secure and
much lower than that of the US, Europe and Japan, leaving enough room
for further positive regulation. Going forward, five new engines will
drive forward China's economy. The first engine is the 13th Five Year
Plan. With its five key development concepts -- innovation, balanced
growth, a green economy, opening up and inclusive development -- this
Plan will map out the way for China to get over the "middle-income trap"
and join the high-income economies. The second engine is supply-side
reform. Rather than being a copy of Reaganomics or Thatcherism[, China's
supply-side reform is a response to the economic "new normal" in China.
Its core mechanism is to replace ineffective and low-end supply with
effective and high-end supply, which will increase
competitiveness.]{.underline} The third engine is open development.
[China will continue to improve its domestic business environment in
terms of legal, international and business-friendly
practices.]{.underline} The fourth engine is China's active involvement
in global economic governance and in providing public goods. The Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank, officially inaugurated last month, is
just one example of this. The fifth engine is innovation-driven
development. [China will optimise the allocation of key resources in
order to stimulate innovation, to create new demands and new supply, and
to give rise to new businesses.]{.underline} Since the financial crisis,
China has made an outstanding contribution to global growth. [It is
widely recognised as the world's economic powerhouse and has fulfilled
its responsibility as a key global player. Make no mistake: that engine
is still full of power and will continue to bring opportunities and
benefits to the world.]{.underline} "Although Zhou was an ancient state,
it had a reform mission." This line from a 3000-year-old Chinese work,
the Classic of Poetry, best portrays the country's commitment to reform.
Today, reform and innovation remain the source of confidence and
strength for China. [There is every reason to look to a world-embracing
China for steady progress and for a promising economic
future.]{.underline}

### AT: Diversionary War

#### No diversionary wars \-\-- social instability is too dangerous

Relations \*PhD, David M. Rubenstein senior fellow for energy and the
environment at the CFR \*\*PhD, C.V. Starr senior fellow and director

\...But **[[Beijing Is Unlikely to Wage War if the Economy
Crashes]{.underline}]{.mark}**

By the same token, [[analysts should]{.mark} probably [discard the
notion that a crash of the domestic economy would provoke a Chinese
military adventure abroad in order to distract Chinese people]{.mark}
from upheaval at home. [This]{.mark} "wag the dog" scenario [may gain
currency with **screenplay writers**]{.mark}]{.underline} and conspiracy
buffs, [[but it is not borne out by history. Although it is true that
strife-torn countries often get embroiled in external wars, it is rarely
because their leaders set out **to generate a diversionary
activity**]{.mark} for their restive populace.]{.underline}

Indeed, most workshop participants argued that [[if China were beset by
an]{.mark} acute [internal crisis, the]{.mark} Communist [Party
would]{.mark} almost certainly **[refocus its energy and resources
inward]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The leadership]{.mark} and its security
apparatus, including components of the military, [would have their hands
full protecting against social instability]{.mark}]{.underline}, tamping
down the activities of Uighur and Tibetan separatists, and maintaining
the cohesiveness of the party itself. [[To launch a foreign war in an
atmosphere of domestic public grievance would be **particularly
dangerous** ]{.mark}**for Beijing.**]{.underline} [[If China sustained a
defeat]{.mark} at the hands of the Japanese or U.S. navy, [the
leadership would compound its reputation for economic
mismanagement]{.mark} with one for military ineptitude---a potentially
lethal cocktail for the ruling party.]{.underline}

### AT: CCP Collapse

#### Growth or decline doesn't matter \-\-- it's how the regime [frames]{.underline} the issue, which proves it's resilient

**Zeng, 16** -- PhD in Politics and IR, Associate Fellow at the Centre
for the Study of Globalisation and Regionalisation at the University of
Warwick, and Lecturer in Politics and IR at Royal Holloway, University
of London \[Jinghan, "The Chinese Communist Party's Capacity to Rule,"
Oct 29, 2015 Palgrave Macmillan *Critical Studies of the Asia-Pacific*,
Academia\]

As mentioned in the Introduction chapter, **[[there is no empirical
evidence to prove that the CCP's legitimacy solely relies on economic
success]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Arguably, [there are two major problems
in the relevant literature: the exclusion of ideological factors and the
narrow focus of government performance]{.underline}. [[The major problem
with the socioeconomic]{.mark} performance [approach lies in its
exclusion of ideological factors, **which leads to many problematic
arguments and predictions**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [The performance
legitimacy approach implies a problematic relationship between economy
and politics]{.underline} (White, 1986). [[The argument -- **that
legitimacy of the CCP**]{.mark} **primarily [relies on economic
performance]{.mark}**]{.underline} [-- [implies that economic
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} [or the slowdown of economic growth would
[lead to some kinds of legitimacy]{.mark} crises or major disasters in
China.]{.underline} This is also explicitly warned by many who argue
that economic deterioration will unavoidably lead to political crisis
(Krugman, 2013; Zhao, 2009). This kind of argument implies that economic
factors are the independent or dominant variables, while political
factors are subordinate or dependent variables. [[It is flawed to
contend that the regime is helpless in an economic
crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline} This book endorses White's assertion (1986)
on the primacy of politics -- that proper political actions can fill the
deficit in legitimacy created by economic difficulties. As mentioned in
the Introduction chapter, **[[legitimacy]{.mark} directly [comes from
neither economic crisis nor economic growth]{.mark}]{.underline}** per
se (Gilley and Holbig, 2010). [[Ideological factors will transform
economic performance into people's subjective perceptions]{.mark} of
economic performance, and [regime legitimacy is based on "those
perception]{.mark}s" rather than on economic performance]{.underline}
per se. As such, **[[an economic crisis is not a direct threat to a
regime]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [its impacts on political legitimacy
depend on people's perceptions of the crisis and the regime; thus, how
the government frames this crisis is crucial]{.underline} (Gilley and
Holbig, 2010). In other words, [[how political actors use ideological
factors to frame]{.mark} people's [perceptions of the crisis]{.mark}
(i.e., discourse) [is key to deciding the impact of the crisis on
legitimacy.]{.mark}]{.underline} Proper political actions and effective
crisis management will contribute to minimize legitimacy loss or even
sometimes enhance legitimacy. As discussed below, [[there is much room
to manipulate people's dependency]{.mark} on the government and on its
irreplaceable role during a crisi]{.underline}s. This is especially true
in China, where people's dependency on the government is more obvious
because of historical traditions (Tong, 2011). [The CCP has abundant
experience and the capability to market its authoritarian rule through
information control and powerful propaganda campaigns]{.underline}. In
the 2008 financial crisis, for example, the Chinese government actually
won, rather than lost, legitimacy credits. [[The regime strategically
manipulated this crisis as an opportunity to achieve its political
purposes]{.underline}]{.mark} including the promotion of Scientific
Outlook of Development (Holbig, 2011). [The Chinese media highlighted
China's good performance in coping with the financial crisis
domestically in contrast with the disaster that this crisis caused in
other countries]{.underline}, and the official media also made efforts
to project international recognition onto China's crisis management. By
[using those propaganda strategies, [the CCP]{.mark} successfully
[transformed its performance during this crisis into positive
perceptions, **thus legitimacy**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Holbig, 2011).

#### No internal link \-\-- the economy is not directly reflected in legitimacy \-\-- ideology outweighs

**Zeng, 16** -- PhD in Politics and IR, Associate Fellow at the Centre
for the Study of Globalisation and Regionalisation at the University of
Warwick, and Lecturer in Politics and IR at Royal Holloway, University
of London \[Jinghan, "The Chinese Communist Party's Capacity to Rule,"
Oct 29, 2015 Palgrave Macmillan *Critical Studies of the Asia-Pacific*,
Academia\]

[Economic performance is the most frequently mentioned element of
performance legitimacy]{.underline}. The conventional wisdom of Western
scholar- ship holds that economic achievement is a principal (if not the
sole) pillar of legitimacy in contemporary China (Krugman, 2013;
Laliberté and Lanteigne, 2008b; Perry, 2008; Shambaugh, 2001; Wang,
2005a; Wang, 2005b; Zhao, 2009; Yang and Zhao, 2014). In a major
textbook on Chinese politics, Tony Saich (2004: 347) argues that
"\[CCP\] legitimacy is currently based on the capacity to deliver the
economic goods." Economic performance is absolutely important. However,
[**[empirical studies]{.underline}** [show that while economic
performance matters]{.underline}, **[there is no strong
evidence]{.underline}** [to prove that it is the
sole]{.underline}]{.mark}[, let alone the principal, [pillar of
legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline} (Chu, 2013; Lewis-Beck, et al., 2013;
Munro, et al., 2013; Yang and Tang, 2013). In addition[, if economic
prosperity leads to high levels of popular support for the government,
why do not other coun- tries that enjoy economic prosperity -- such as
India and Brazil -- also have high levels of support, as China
does]{.underline} (Tang, et al., 2013)? Based on [[a 2010 national
survey]{.underline}]{.mark} in China, Dickson (2013) [[finds a negative
rela- tionship between economic development and popular
support.]{.mark}]{.underline} In addition to economic performance,
[[social stability is another essen- tial element of government
performance]{.mark}, and it has also been widely accepted as a
fundamental pillar of the CCP's legitimacy]{.underline} (Breslin, 2009;
Dickson, 2011; Laliberté and Lanteigne, 2008b; Shue, 2004; Sandby-
Thomas, 2011). Shue (2004), for example, argues that [[the CCP "stakes"
its legitimacy on its ability to maintain social
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}. Needless to say, social stability and
economic growth are interdependent. Without a stable social order, the
economy cannot grow rapidly; conversely the welfare materials delivered
by economic growth might help to enhance social stability. [This
interdependence suggests that the rules of modern states are based on
different combinations of legitimacy sources rather than on any one
pillar]{.underline}. Legitimacy by nature has many dimensions, and its
sources are often interrelated. [[Ideology]{.mark} in particular [plays
a crucial role in influ- encing other sources of
legitimacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Arguably, [a fatal weakness of the
performance legitimacy approach is its insufficient attention to ideo-
logical factors]{.underline}. As mentioned, **[[the mainstream approach
overempha- sizes economic growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and many
assume that market reform has also rendered ideology obsolete. [This
misguided view has **underestimated the role of ideology**]{.mark} in
contemporary China]{.underline}. Legitimacy generated from government
performance is not directly through government performance per se but
from citizens' subjective perceptions of this performance. Ideological
factors play a crucial role in shaping those perceptions. Thus,
**[[economic performance -- crisis or growth -- is not directly
reflected in legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Gilley and Holbig,
2010); [[the performance will be framed by ideological factors]{.mark}
and transformed by conductive ways [into people's subjective perceptions
of economic performance]{.mark}. If economic performance became the sole
legitimacy pillar in China, then economic deterioration would
unavoidably lead to political crisis. However, [the financial
crisis]{.mark} of 2008 [enhanced rather than weakened the CCP's
rule]{.mark}]{.underline} (Holbig, 2011). [By using the Chinese media to
highlight the good performance in coping with the financial crisis
domestically and the disaster this crisis caused in other countries, the
CCP managed to manipulate this debacle as an opportunity to gain
legitimacy and achieve its political purposes]{.underline} -- such as
marketing its then-official ideology, the "Scientific Outlook of
Development" (Holbig, 2011).

JJM: [My argument]{.underline}, in a nutshell, [is that [if China
continues to grow economically]{.mark} over the next 30
years,]{.underline} much the way it has over the past 30 years, [that
[it will **translate that wealth into military might**.]{.mark} And [it
will try to **dominate Asia**]{.mark}, the way the United States
dominates the Western Hemisphere.]{.underline} And my argument is that
[this makes good strategic sense for China. Of course[, the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates will not allow that to happen if it can.
And the United States will, therefore, form a balancing coalition in
Asia, which will include most of China's neighbors and the United
States. And they [will work overtime to]{.mark} try to [contain China
and prevent it from dominating Asia. This will lead to a **very intense
security competition** between the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and
[China's neighbors]{.mark} on one hand, [and China]{.mark} on the other
hand. And **[there will be]{.mark} an ever-present danger of
[war.]{.mark}**]{.underline} PN: Of course [[from this]{.mark}
observation [rises the imperative if not to strangle China's
economy]{.mark} then [to]{.mark} certainly [slow it
down]{.mark}]{.underline}. JJM: There's no question that preventive war
makes no sense at all, [but a much more attractive strategy would be to
do whatever we could to slow down China's economic growth]{.underline}.
Because [[if it doesn't grow economically, it can't turn that wealth
into military might and become a potential hegemon]{.mark} in
Asia]{.underline}. I mean, [what really makes China so scary today is
the fact that it has so many people and it's also becoming an incredibly
wealthy country.]{.underline} Our great fear is that China will turn
into a giant Hong Kong. And [[if it has a per capita GNP]{.mark} that's
anywhere [near Hong Kong's]{.mark} GNP, [it will be **one formidable
military power**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So the question is, Can you
prevent it from becoming a giant Hong Kong?

### Growth Bad -- Japan 

#### Chinese economic decline prevents Sino-Japan war and cements US leadership

Similarly, [[China's economic slowdown could offer Japan an occasion to
gain leverage]{.mark} in the Sino-Japanese relationship, [creating the
possibility to tamp down tensions]{.mark} in the East China Sea [and
stabilize bilateral ties]{.mark}]{.underline} that remain a fragile, but
critically important, component of the regional security landscape.
Perhaps most significantly, [[a Chinese economic slowdown affords
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[an opportunity to buttress]{.mark} its political, economic, and
military [position in the Asia-Pacific, and assuage worries that
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [lacks sufficient strategic
vision]{.mark}]{.underline} and political commitment to the region. The
outcome relies on how Washington plays its hand, but [[the result could
be the strengthening of a rules-based, U.S.-led security
architecture]{.mark} in the Asia-Pacific region for years to
come]{.underline}.

#### A Chinese-Japan war is only an incident away and goes nuclear

Jan 22,

While your Twitter and Facebook feed these days might be filled with
stories about Iran, North Korea and ISIS, as well as the South China
Sea, 2016 could be the year of a deadly clash between China and
Japan---and the stakes could not be any higher for the United States. A
recent article in Foreign Policy sets the stage for such a clash---and
shows how America could get sucked in. After a relatively peaceful
year---if such a thing exists in the East China Sea---[[Beijing and
Tokyo are]{.mark} once again [warning each other]{.mark} to back off
claims [over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands]{.mark}]{.underline}. With the
rhetoric heading up, Foreign Policy reporters Dan De Luce and Keith
Johnson headed over to the Rand Corporation for a war game that pitted
China vs. Japan and eventually the United States. In the simulation,
Tokyo's treaty ally pledged to defend the island nation, including the
disputed islands, from attack. The scenario for the wargame was
frighteningly realistic to say the least: ["[A group of]{.mark} renegade
[Japanese ultranationalists wade ashore]{.mark} on [a barren
islet]{.mark} they call Uotsuri-shima]{.underline}. It's the largest of
a cluster of uninhabited and uninhabitable rocks known as the Senkakus,
or the Diaoyu in Chinese, the unlikely locus of a long-running
territorial dispute between Tokyo and Beijing. [[The activists plant the
Japanese flag]{.mark}, declaring that the islands are inalienable
Japanese territory;]{.underline} their YouTube video threatens the
Chinese navy with destruction if it dares to seize the islands. "Caught
off guard, Tokyo is slow to respond, but eventually disowns the
ultranationalists and their stunt. By then, though, [[China]{.mark} has
[condemned the move as a hostile act and]{.mark} has [dispatched]{.mark}
armed [coast guard]{.mark} and [naval vessels]{.mark} to the relatively
shallow waters around the Senkakus.]{.underline} Chinese marines arrest
the 14 activists and vow to bring them back to China for prosecution.
"The next day, [[the Japan Maritime]{.mark}
[S]{.mark}]{.underline}elf-[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}efense
[[F]{.underline}]{.mark}orce [[is dispatched]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
area, [[accompanied by]{.mark} a squadron of [Japanese F-15
fighters]{.mark}]{.underline}. China maintains its naval ships around
the islands and insists that it will not withdraw from the area. As the
two militaries appear headed on a collision course, [Tokyo informs
Washington that it is finally invoking the mutual defense treaty the two
nations have had since 1951. Now the White House has a decision to
make."]{.underline} While it is well worth your time to read all the
twists and turns, here is the ultimate of spoilers: "The United States
sends humanitarian aid and disaster-response teams to Japan to bolster
its homeland defense and dispatches the carrier at a safe distance in
flight range of the Senkakus. It also launches targeted, precision
strikes on a handful of Chinese missile sites on the coast, clearly
explaining to Chinese leadership the limited nature of the measures."
And **[[into hell we descend]{.underline}]{.mark}**: "U[.S. [missiles
rain down on the Chinese homeland]{.mark}]{.underline}; Japanese
commercial freighters explode on the high seas; [China's shiny new navy
is quickly shrinking under relentless undersea attacks.]{.underline} In
reprisal[, [Chinese forces obliterate Kadena]{.mark}]{.underline} Air
Base on Okinawa and take a potshot with a carrier-killer missile at the
George Washington, damaging it and forcing it out of the area. The
casualty toll is appalling on all sides, with thousands dead." Feel a
sense of déjà vu, National Interest readers? It seems good minds think
alike, as I explored a very similar scenario back in June of 2014:
"Picture it: It\'s March 1, 2015. Tokyo and Beijing are headed towards
what was once the unthinkable. "Over the last several months China has
instituted daily non-naval maritime patrols around the hotly disputed
Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Beijing is even sending fully-fledged naval
assets within the islands\' 12 mile exclusion zone while its aircraft
carrier, the Liaoning, exercised only 50 miles away from the islands
back in February --- truly the end of Beijing\'s small-stick diplomatic
strategy. "But on 1 March the plot thickens. Two Chinese SU-27 fighters
come within 25 feet of a Japanese P-3 Orion surveillance plane just 10
miles west of the Senkakus (sound familiar?). The Japanese pilot gets
nervous. A slight tweak at the controls and the Japanese plane collides
with one of the Chinese fighters. Both aircraft crash into the ocean,
with no survivors. \"Naturally each side blames the other. Beijing
accuses the Japanese pilots of violating Chinese sovereign airspace and
violating its Air Defense Identification Zone, or ADIZ. Japan claims the
Chinese pilots acted recklessly, flying so close. The media in both
countries fan the flames of nationalism. Just 72 hours later, a group of
twenty Chinese nationals land on one of the disputed islands under the
cover of darkness. Rumors swirl that Beijing knew of the voyage but did
nothing to stop it. A Japanese naval task force carrying a small
detachment of soldiers is dispatched. Their goal: remove the only
residents of the disputed five-island chain. "Beijing threatens force if
its citizens are harmed. As Japanese naval forces come within 20 miles
of the islands a Chinese J-10 fighter jet buzzes the task force. On its
second pass it comes dangerously close to a Japanese destroyer. In a
perceived act of self-defense, the destroyer shoots down the aircraft.
"Hours later, as Japanese forces begin operations to remove the Chinese
nationals from the Senkakus, Beijing fires a warning shot, a DF-21D or
"carrier-killer" missile which hits the ocean just 10 miles away from
the Japanese task force. Undeterred, Japanese forces press ahead.
Domestic pressure on Chinese leaders becomes intense. They feel they
have no choice but to escalate, launching a massive saturation strike
with ballistic and cruise missiles against the Japanese task force.
Three vessels are hit with heavy loss of life. Global media coverage of
the burning hulks and bodies in the water reaches a fever pitch. Prime
Minister Abe urgently phones President Obama formally requesting
America\'s help under the terms of the US-Japan alliance --- a 3am call
no president would ever wish to receive. War in Asia seems imminent." So
what to make of all this crazy block quoting? Simple: a [[conflict in
Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}---which would make problems like ISIS seem
like mere child\'s play---**[[is only an incident
away]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And make no mistake about it, [such a
conflict, [considering]{.mark} that [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and China are armed with nuclear
weapons]{.mark}, would be a frightening affair]{.underline}. Food for
thought as we contemplate other pressing national security
challenges---for if [Asia was ever to be engulfed in the flames of great
power war [only bad things would result, with millions of lives in the
balance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Growth Bad -- BioD

#### Chinese growth causes massive species extinction in China---extinction

**Nagle 9** \[John Copeland, prof at Notre Dame Law School, "The
Effectiveness of Biodiversity Law," Spring, 24 J. Land Use & Envtl. Law
203\]

China offers the best and the worst of biodiversity protection.
[China]{.underline} is a vast, varied nation that [hosts an incredible
range of ecosystems and species. \"[China\'s biodiversity ranks eighth
in the world]{.mark} and first in the northern hemisphere.\" n67 Over
100,000 species of animals and nearly 33,000 plant species
exist]{.underline} in 460 different types of ecosystems. Those
ecosystems include forests, grasslands, deserts, wetlands, seas and
coastal areas, and agricultural ecosystems. China hosts 212 different
types of bamboo forests alone. [[China also has]{.mark} an unusual
number of [ancient]{.mark} and relic [species because of its protection
from historic geologic events]{.mark} such as the movement of
glaciers]{.underline}. Most famously, it is the only home of the giant
panda, the symbol of many efforts to protect biodiversity throughout the
world today. Such species and ecosystem diversity is complemented by an
unsurpassed collection of genetic diversity. \"[The [richness]{.mark} of
China\'s cultivated plants and domestic animals [are
incomparable]{.mark} in the world. [Not only did many plants and animals
on which human survival depend originate in China, but it also retains
large numbers of]{.mark} their wild prototypes and
[relatives]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} n68 A 2005 report estimated that
China\'s biodiversity is valued at nearly five hundred billion dollars.
n69 China is also the home for more than 1.25 billion people. The
[[rapid economic growth]{.mark} that China has experienced]{.underline}
since 1980 [[strains the]{.mark} nation\'s [ability to preserve
ecosystems]{.mark}, species, and genetic resources]{.underline}. But the
biodiversity of China has encountered countless threats for thousands of
years, including the cultivation of more and more land for agriculture
and the consequences of numerous wars. During the Great Leap Forward of
1958 to 1960, \[\*216\] Mao Zedong targeted the \"Four Pests\": rats,
sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes. The attack on sparrows enlisted
schoolchildren to knock down nests and to beat gongs so that the
sparrows could not find a place to rest. Only after sparrows were
virtually eliminated throughout China did the country\'s leaders
recognize the value of the birds in controlling insects. [China faces
many of the same threats as biodiversity]{.underline} in other
countries, [with the notable addition of the country\'s notorious air
pollution. Habitat loss is the biggest threat to biodiversity in
China]{.underline}. As in many other countries, [rapid economic
[development and]{.mark} continued [population growth exert relentless
pressure]{.mark} on previously undeveloped areas that offered habitat to
a diversity of wildlife and plants]{.underline}. The overgrazing of
rangelands, erosion, and the adverse effects of tourism and mining
further compromise the condition of ecosystems and species throughout
China.

The Final Report released by the US National Security Commission on
Artificial Intelligence in 2021 describes China as a "competitor," if
not a leader, to the United States in terms of AI development. A basic
understanding of the US-China AI competition is established in the
report: ". . . we must win the AI competition that is intensifying
strategic competition with China. [China's plans, resources, and
progress should concern all Americans.]{.underline} It is an AI peer in
many areas and an AI leader in some applications. We take seriously
China's ambition to surpass the United States as the world's AI leader
within a decade."5 The report also foresees [China's determination to
surpass the United States in AI leadership with its talent and
technological development.]{.underline} This section demonstrates the
area of China's AI development and applications. Before digging into the
military aspects, the reason China has been devoted into AI should be
explained. In 2015, China issued the document Made in China 2025 and two
years later in 2017, China released the New Generation Artificial
Intelligence Development Plan. These two documents proved that China's
central government officially confirmed the importance of developing AI
technologies. The primary purpose of China's AI development is for
domestic use. First, advanced technologies are the major driving force
for the economic and commercial development in China. To maintain its
rapid growth, China encourages high technologies research and
development, including AI, thus many private firms and research
institutions have entered this field. Second, AI has been adopted
domestically to improve the overall well-being, for example, payment
using facial recognition, online AI-driven medical diagnosis, and
security cameras that are designed to enhance safety. [China\'s
determination]{.underline} of developing [AI technologies
is]{.underline} not [supported]{.underline} only [by]{.underline}
documents but also [practice.]{.underline} The Ministry of National
Defense has established research institutions---the Artificial
Intelligence Research Centre and the Unmanned Systems Research
Centre---to focus on AI and unmanned systems research and development.
The key military think tank, the Academy of Military Science (AMS), has
also updated its doctrine to cope with the AI technological development:
"The [revamped AMS is tasked with driving defense innovation and
ensuring that the]{.underline} People's Liberation Army's
([PLA]{.underline}) warfighting theory [and doctrine fully capitalize on
disruptive technologies]{.underline} like AI and autonomous systems."6
In addition to the government-backed official organizations, a number of
private institutions have also invested considerable sums of money to
conduct related research. The central government of China uses the term
"intelligentized" warfare to refer to the innovations in military
technologies.7 Ryan Fedasiuk, Jennifer Melot, and Ben Murphy analyzed
more than 300 AI-related equipment contracts of the PLA regarding the
adoption of AI technologies, and the result of their research shows that
around 2 percent of PLA contracts are related to AI in the half year
from April to November 2020. [The research also predicted that China
would continue to invest in AI technologies and may create
vulnerabilities for the United States.]{.underline} Moreover, to quickly
transfer technologies from the private sector to the public, [China also
launched a national strat]{.underline}egy, [the military-civil
fusion]{.underline}, [to create a favorable research]{.underline} and
development environment.8 Among all the AI technologies, China places
the top priority on unmanned combat systems and equipment along with
other advanced military innovations.9 Unmanned technology has been
profoundly [changing the face of warfare, and unmanned equipment is one
of the first options for future combat equipment]{.underline}. Since
President Xi Jinping took office, he has emphasized the importance of
unmanned systems on various occasions. For example, in 2017, when Xi
Jinping visited the training of unmanned operations, he said to the
sergeant that "UAVs are important combat forces for the modern
battlefield. You must carry out your duties well and cultivate good
personnel."10 Another example was in 2020, when Xi met students at the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force Aviation University, he
declared, "Drones are profoundly changing war scenarios. It is necessary
to strengthen drone combat research, education and training, and
accelerate the training of drone pilots and commanders."11 The
capacities of unmanned combat systems include effectively reducing
casualties, achieving accurate reconnaissance, striking, resupplying,
configuring flexible activities, and significantly improving combat
effectiveness---to list only a few of many such advantages. With the
development of unmanned technology, human warfare places more and more
value upon information, which AI and unmanned systems excel at
procuring. China's development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) began
in the late 1950s.12 In 1959, it had basically figured out the law of
self-pilot takeoff and landing of two types of aircraft, namely the An-2
and IL-28. In the mid to late 1960s, China had been investing in the
development of UAVs and formed a series of target aircraft such as the
Changkong-1 radio-controlled target UAV, the DR-5 high-altitude photo
reconnaissance aircraft, and the D4 small remote-controlled aircraft.
Moreover, in August 1958, the first unmanned aircraft developed by
Northwestern Polytechnic University flew successfully, and in 1984, the
university established the UAV Research Institute with the approval of
the former Ministry of Aviation Industry. In the1970s, China developed
ChangHong high-altitude high-speed unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, T-6
general-purpose unmanned aircraft, Z-5 series unmanned reconnaissance
aircraft, ASN series unmanned aircraft, and so forth. Dozens of these
target and reconnaissance UAVs have been mass-produced and deployed
alongside troops. The emergence of a large number of Chinese military
UAVs began in 2006, when a number of military UAV designs appeared
publicly in the limelight, such as the "Xianglong" high-altitude
high-speed unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, whose body design is very
similar to the US "Global Hawk" high-altitude long-endurance
reconnaissance UAV; the "Skyhawk-3" unmanned helicopter that can hover,
take off, and land vertically; and the "Dark Sword" UAV shaped like a
US-made stealth bomber, which can burst into the enemy's airspace with
its stealth and high-speed performance and conduct suppressive attacks
on the enemy's air defense forces.13 The PLA is equipped with at least
four types of medium and large UAVs, namely the EA-03 Xianglong, the
Attack 1 (Wing Dragon 1), the JWP02 (ASN-206), and the BZK-005 UAV.
EA-03 Xianglong is China's most advanced high-altitude long-endurance
unmanned reconnaissance aircraft in service. With a status similar to
that of the US RQ4 global-use UAV, it is mainly adopted for
high-altitude strategic surveillance reconnaissance. The aircraft has an
overall length of 14.33 meters, a wingspan of 24.86 meters, a normal
takeoff weight of 6,800 kilograms, a mission load of 600 kilograms and
an effective flight range of 7,000 kilometers. It can conduct continuous
aerial surveillance for 10 hours at an altitude of 18,000 meters from
2,000 kilometers away. The front and rear wings are connected in a
diamond shape, which greatly strengthens the stiffness of the wings with
a certain stealth capability.14 During the standoff in DongLang in the
in last year between China and India, three Xianglong aircraft had
appeared at Shigatse airport, and this confirmed that troops have been
equipped with the aircraft. The Attack-1, improved from Chengfei
Institute\'s Yilong-1 (sometimes call the Wing Loong), was unveiled at
the 2014 Zhuhai Airshow and was the first active PLA inspection and
fighter UAV that was made public at the airshow. Its shape is similar to
that of the US UAV MQ-9, while its size is similar to that of the MQ-1
Predator. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 1.2 tons, a length of 9
meters, a wingspan of 14 meters, a payload of 200 kilograms, a maximum
lift of 5,300 meters and a range of 4,000 kilometers. The latest
Yilong-2 has a major improvement in both size and performance, with a
length of 11 meters, a wingspan of 20.5 meters, a maximum flight
altitude of 9,000 meters, a maximum speed of 370 kilometers per hour, a
maximum takeoff weight of 4.2 tons, and an external hang-up capacity of
480 kilograms. It is equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) as
well as laser-guided missiles and GPS-guided bombs and is able to
perform continuous missions for 20 hours. To date, there has been no
news that the Yilong-2 has been put into service.15 The JWP02 UAV
(ASN-206) was developed by the Xi'an Aisheng Group of Northwestern
Polytechnic University and won the first prize of the National Science
and Technology Progress Award in 1996. It is rumored that it had
received technical support from Israel. The aircraft applies solid
rockets in assisting flight, zero-length launch, parachute landing and
recovery, and can be used multiple times. It has a maximum takeoff
weight of 222 kilograms, mission equipment weight of 50 kilograms,
practical lift of 6,000 meters, range of 150 kilometers, and endurance
of four to eight hours. The aircraft, which was developed earlier than
Attack-1 UAV, currently serves as the mainstay of China\'s tactical
unmanned reconnaissance aircraft along with the Attack-1 UAV.16 BZK-005
UAV has certain stealth capability and is a medium and high-altitude
long-range unmanned reconnaissance aircraft. It has a maximum lift of
8,000 meters, an endurance of 40 hours, a maximum takeoff weight of 1.25
tons and a maximum carrying weight of 150 kilograms. Early models are
equipped with photoelectric pods, while the latest models are equipped
with SAR and other electronic reconnaissance equipment. The media
reported that the aircraft has been on a patrol flight mission in the
East China Sea. The TYW1 Skyhawk UAV, which was developed on the basis
of the BZK-005, rolled off the production line on November 14, 2017. It
is reported that the maximum takeoff weight of the TYW-1 has increased
to 1.5 tons, with a maximum bomb load of 300 kilograms.17 UAVs play
three important roles in military applications, the first of which is
reconnaissance and surveillance.18 UAVs can penetrate hundreds of
kilometers or more behind enemy lines and are configured at high,
medium, and low altitudes. They can provide important reference for
strategic decision-making and battle command in large-scale military
operations through scanning reconnaissance and close-in reconnaissance
to obtain highly accurate intelligence information. The latter is very
suitable for [PLA military, divisional, and brigade-level forces of the
PLA Marine Corps to conduct battlefield reconnaissance surveillance,
target search and location]{.underline}, as well as battle results
assessment. UAVs can also work with satellites and skywave
over-the-horizon radar [to search and track enemy maritime
targets]{.underline} and transmit back target information in real time.
In this way, military UAVs can become an important part of the "kill
chain" in antiaircraft-carrier warfare. The second is electronic
jamming.19 Electronic-jamming UAVs can fly over the enemy, emitting
electromagnetic waves through their airborne equipment and the
application of interference foil, and so forth to implement interference
on the enemy's air defense radar, fire control radar, early warning
systems, and other electronic equipment to cover China\'s aircraft
defense and ground attack. The third role is firepower destruction. In
addition to antiradiation UAVs that can destruct the enemy's radar and
other electromagnetic equipment, attack UAVs, inspection and fighter
UAVs, and so forth can also carry out effective firepower destruction
against the enemy. Acquisition of UAV technologies has enhanced China's
confidence to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance tasks to protect
claimed territory. In the early 2010s, China for the first time sent a
UAV to the Diaoyu Dao/ Senkaku Island disputed area.20 It was able to
easily avoid the detection of Japanese ground radar, which surprised the
Japanese coast guard. It was only a short and tactical victory that the
Chinese UAVs exploited the loopholes in Japan\'s air defense system and
reached the Diaoyu Islands for cruising with an ultra-low-altitude blind
spot; it did not change the strategic pattern of the Japanese side's
effective control over the Diaoyu Islands. The most common unmanned
aircraft to cruise the Diaoyu Islands is the BZK-005 unmanned
reconnaissance aircraft---equipped with a rear-propelled engine, a
dual-tail brace structure and an under-nose photoelectric/infrared
detection device---first unveiled at the Zhuhai Airshow in 2006 and
capable of flying continuously for 40 hours at an altitude of 26,000
feet.21 The BZK-005's primary detection system is an electro-optical pod
under the nose, which is equipped with a forward-looking infrared
detection system, CCD cameras, and a laser range/target designation
system. Wave-transparent materials are applied in the BZK-005 UAV; thus,
it can be determined that it has a satellite communication system that
can transmit information to the rear over radio range, which also
indicates that the BZK-005 should have an activity radius of more than
1,000 kilometers. The application of the BZK-005 UAV has effectively
enhanced the capability of China\'s naval maritime integrated
surveillance system. At present, the quantity and quality of China\'s
naval maritime surveillance aircraft are insufficient, and the
application of the BZK-005 can improve the capability and coverage of
China\'s naval target detection and indication system, especially for
accurate detection and identification of targets in the middle and near
sea, which helps China to comprehensively grasp the real-time situation
in the relevant sea areas and provides support for relevant decision
making. For nearly a decade since China sent the BZK-005 to the Diaoyu
Island area without alerting Japan, Japan has been cooperating with the
United States to equip itself by importing UAVs. Early this year,
Japanese media reported that the United States and Japan are currently
discussing a military deployment against China. According to the report,
the United States and Japan plan to deploy MQ-9 UAVs near Kagoshima, a
move designed to "respond to China\'s" regular military operations.22
UAVs are characterized by high speed and high altitude. The MQ-9 made
its first flight in 2014 after improvements were made, and then it was
used by the US military. It is understood that the UAV deployed in
Kagoshima is a reconnaissance type and it is also the first time the
United States deployed this high-altitude type of UAV in Japan. With the
US pivots in Asia, tensions between the two giants, namely China and the
United States, have been inevitable. Located in the southwestern tip of
Japan, Kagoshima has a very special geographical location in that, if
the United States deploys the MQ-9 UAV on the island, it will obtain the
information about the activities of the Chinese naval fleet. In other
words, the MQ-9 UAV is the US "eye" planted in the vicinity of China for
receiving information. In addition, the specific location of the US
deployment of the MQ-9 UAV is also thought-provoking, for the reason
that to the further south of Kagoshima, there are the Okinawa Islands,
followed by the Miyako Strait waters. This area is the "treasure land"
that is of great military importance. When the United States and Japan
intervenes in the Taiwan Strait conflict, should it occur, the Miyako
Strait waters are the shortest cut they must go through. Obviously,
China is also aware of this problem. Therefore, China should pay close
attention to the Miyako Strait when the cross-strait unification attack
commences, if this is the only way. In this context, the US UAVs
deployed in Kagoshima are the main means of reconnaissance for the
United States and Japan. [The UAVs must not only watch out for the moves
of the Chinese side, but also conduct reconnaissance of Chinese defense
networks.]{.underline} UAVs are not only used in the East China Sea
area, but also the South China Sea area. Even in the border conflicts
between China and India, UAVs were also applied. Despite that there has
not been any offensive action taken by UAVs in the mentioned areas, one
cannot deny the potential there. Considering the unstable situation in
the Indo-Pacific, states either focus on AI technologies research,
including UAVs, or import arms and technologies from others. It is still
unknown that whether the applications of AI technology will eventually
arouse an arm race. Concerns The advanced AI technologies that are
applied in the military field can exert great impact on deterrence and
warfare in the future. Meanwhile, China's rapid development of AI
technologies and applications in its military are cause for increasing
concern by the United States. Despite the success of China's AI in
commercial areas, no clear evidence has indicated that China's military
has plans to apply AI in any lethal systems. In the short term,
weaknesses still exist despite China's preexisting foundation on AI
commercial applications. Allen points out that China has disadvantages
in top talents and technical standards, as well as in software
frameworks and platforms.23 For example, the case of restrictions on ZTE
and Huawei clearly reveals that China heavily depends on imports of
critical products, which means that China still has a long way to go
until it becomes fully independent in vital sectors, such as
semiconductors. AI technology itself is not offensive, but [it is likely
to play an irreplaceable directorial role in warfare if it is applied to
automating weapons]{.underline}, especially nuclear weapons. To avoid
unwanted jeopardy to any nations, the top priority is to ensure human
intervention is involved in AI that are applied in security-related
areas. AI actually lowers the threshold of offensive military actions
because of the limited casualty risk. States, including China and the
United States, should cooperate on preventing the abuse of AI. According
to the China Global Television Network, China is the first nation that
has submitted the position paper to the United Nations Convention on
Certain Conventional Weapons for regulating the application of AI
technologies in military field in December 2021.24 In other words, as
with the control of nuclear weapons, norms and regulations are needed to
limit the use of AI armaments. The [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is concerned about the global
prolif]{.underline}eration [of unmanned systems]{.underline} and other
AI weapons [since China lacks export restrictions.]{.underline} [China's
purposes of exporting unmanned arms, such as UAVs, include but are not
limited to protecting overseas Chinese and investment security,
establishing and consolidating diplomatic relations, and creating
commercial profits.]{.underline}25 The United States is concerned about
the unrestricted export for not only security reasons, but also economic
ones. To prevent China from occupying the international market of
unmanned systems, previous president Donald Trump reinterpreted the
Missile Technology Control Regime to boost the export of UAVs. The Biden
administration is willing to continue Trump's policy, which made the
export more flexible.26 Therefore, if both superpowers obtain unmanned
technologies and export the arms mainly for commercial purpose, it is
unnecessary for the United States to raise high concern. Future As for
the future development of China's AI technology applications in the
military area: First, high-altitude long-endurance will be a primary
focus of UAV development. Previous UAVs have a small carrying capacity,
inadequate power supply, and little endurance, which may result in a
small area of reconnaissance, failure to continuously obtain information
for a long time, and even "blind spots" in intelligence, thus it is
difficult for them to adapt to the needs of future warfare.

### Growth Link

#### Slowing Chinese economic growth is vital to preserving US hegemony

**Mearsheimer 14** -- professor of political science at University of
Chicago, co-director of Program of International Security Policy at
UChicago (John, "Can China Rise Peacefully," *The Tragedy of Great Power
Politics,* October 25^th^, 2014,
http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/can-china-rise-peacefully-10204)

[[There is a]{.underline}]{.mark} small [[possibility China will]{.mark}
eventually [become so powerful that the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will not be
able to contain it]{.underline}]{.mark} and prevent it from dominating
Asia, [[even if the American military remains forward
deployed]{.underline}]{.mark} in that region. China might someday have
far more latent power than any of the four potential hegemons the United
States confronted in the twentieth century. In terms of both population
size and wealth---the building blocks of military power---neither
Wilhelmine Germany, nor imperial Japan, nor Nazi Germany, nor the Soviet
Union came close to matching the United States. Given that China now has
more than four times as many people as the United States and is
projected to have more than three times as many in 2050, Beijing would
enjoy a significant advantage in latent power if it had a per capita GNI
(gross national income) equivalent to that of either Hong Kong or South
Korea. All that [[latent power would allow China to gain a decisive
military advantage]{.mark} over its principal rivals in
Asia,]{.underline} especially when you consider that China would be
operating in its backyard, while the Unites States would be operating
more than 6,000 miles from California. In that circumstance, it is
difficult to see how the United States could prevent China from becoming
a regional hegemon. Moreover, [China would probably be the more
formidable superpower in the ensuing global competition with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. But even if China's GNI does
not rise to those levels, and it ends up with not quite as much latent
power as the United States, it would still be in a good position to make
a run at hegemony in Asia. [All of this tells us [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates **[[has a
profound interest in seeing Chinese economic growth slow
considerably]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the years ahead. [[That outcome
might not be good for American prosperity]{.underline}]{.mark}, much
less for global prosperity, **[[but it would be good for American
security, which is what matters most.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### Impact -- Laundry List

#### Primacy prevents [great-power conflict]{.underline} --- multipolar revisionism [fragments]{.underline} the [global order]{.underline} and causes [nuclear war]{.underline}. 

**Brands & Edel, 19** --- Hal Brands; PhD, Henry A. Kissinger
Distinguished Professor of Global Affairs at the Johns Hopkins School of
Advanced International Studies. Charles Edel; PhD, Senior Fellow and
Visiting Scholar at the United States Studies Centre at the University
of Sydney. ("The Lessons of Tragedy: Statecraft and World Order;" Ch. 6:
Darkening Horizon; Published by *Yale University Press*; //GrRv)

Each of these geopolitical challenges is different, and each reflects
the distinctive interests, ambitions, and history of the country
undertaking it. Yet [there is **growing cooperation** between the
countries that are **challenging** the **regional pillars of the
U.S.-led order.** **Russia** and **China** have **collaborated**
on]{.underline} issues such as energy, sales and development of
**[military technology]{.underline}**, opposition to additional U.S.
military deployments on the Korean peninsula, and naval exercises from
the South China Sea to the Baltic. In Syria, [Iran provided the **shock
troops** that helped keep Russia's ally]{.underline}, Bashar [al-Assad,
in power]{.underline}, as Moscow provided the air power and the
diplomatic cover. "[Our **cooperation** can **isolate
America**]{.underline}," supreme leader Ali Khamenei told Putin in 2017.
More broadly, [what links these challenges together is their
**opposition** to the constellation of **power, norms, and
relationships** that the U.S.-led order entails, and in their propensity
to use **violence**]{.underline}, coercion, and intimidation [as means
of making that opposition **effective**]{.underline}. Taken
collectively, [these challenges constitute a **geopolitical sea
change**]{.underline} from the post-Cold War era.

[The revival of [**great-power competition**
entails]{.mark}]{.underline} higher international tensions than the
world has known for decades, and the revival of [[**arms races, security
dilemmas**, and]{.mark} **other artifacts** of a more **dangerous
past**. It entails **[sharper conflicts]{.mark}** over the international
rules]{.underline} of the road on issues ranging from freedom of
navigation to the illegitimacy of altering borders by force, [and
**intensifying competitions** over states that reside at the
intersection of rival powers' **areas of interest**]{.underline}. It
requires confronting the prospect that [[**rival powers** could
**overturn** the]{.mark} **favorable [regional balances]{.mark}** [that
have **underpinned** the U.S.-led order]{.mark} for decades, and that
[they might construct **rival spheres of
influence**]{.mark}]{.underline} from which America and the liberal
ideas it has long promoted would be excluded. Finally, it necessitates
recognizing that [[great-power rivalry could lead to **great-power
war**]{.underline}]{.mark}, a prospect that seemed to have followed the
Soviet empire onto the ash heap of history.

Both [[**Beijing** and **Moscow** are]{.underline}]{.mark}, after all,
[**optimizing their forces** and **[exercising aggressively]{.mark}** in
preparation [for]{.mark} potential **[conflicts]{.mark}** with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and its allies; [[Russian
doctrine]{.mark} explicitly [emphasizes the]{.mark}]{.underline} limited
[[use of **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark} to achieve escalation
dominance in a war with Washington. In Syria, [U.S. and Russian forces
even came into **deadly contact**]{.underline} in early 2018. American
airpower decimated a contingent of government-sponsored Russian
mercenaries that was attacking a base at which U.S. troops were present,
an incident demonstrating the increasing boldness of Russian operations
and the corresponding potential for escalation. [[The
world]{.underline}]{.mark} has not yet returned to the epic clashes for
global dominance that characterized the twentieth century, but it [[has
returned to]{.mark} the **historical norm** of **[great-power
struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with all the associated dangers.

Those dangers may be even greater than most observers appreciate,
because if today's great-power competitions are still most intense at
the regional level, who is to say where these competitions will end? By
all appearances, [[Russia **does not**]{.mark} **simply [want to
be]{.mark}** [a "**regional power**"]{.mark}]{.underline} (as Obama
cuttingly described it) that dominates South Ossetia and Crimea.37 [[It
**aspires** to]{.mark} the **deep Europe[an]{.mark}** and
**[extra-regional impact]{.mark}** that **previous incarnations** of the
Russian state enjoyed]{.underline}. Why else would Putin boast about how
far his troops can drive into Eastern Europe? [[**Why else** would
Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} be **[[deploy]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing
military power [[into the **Midd**]{.mark}**le
[East?]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**Why else** would it be continuing to
cultivate]{.underline} intelligence and [**military relationships** in
regions as remote as **Latin America?**]{.underline}

Likewise, [[China]{.mark} is **today** focused primarily on securing its
own **geopolitical neighborhood**, but it[s]{.mark} [ambitions]{.mark}
for **tomorrow** [are]{.mark} **clearly much
[bolde]{.mark}r.**]{.underline} Beijing probably does not envision
itself fully overthrowing the international order, simply because it has
profited far too much from the U.S.-anchored global economy. Yet [China
has nonetheless positioned itself for a **global challenge** to **U.S.
influence**]{.underline}. [[Chinese military forces are deploying **ever
farther**]{.mark} from China's immediate periphery; [Beijing has
**projected power** into the **Arctic** and **established
bases**]{.mark} and **logistical points** [in]{.mark} the
**[India]{.mark}n Ocean** [and]{.mark} **Horn of
[Africa]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Popular Chinese movies depict Beijing
replacing Washington as the dominant actor in sub-Saharan Africa---a
fictional representation of a real-life effort long under way. [The
**Belt and Road Initiative** bespeaks an aspiration to **link** China to
countries throughout **Central Asia, the Middle East, and
Europe**]{.underline}; BRI, AIIB, and RCEP look like the beginning of an
alternative institutional architecture to rival Washington's. In 2017,
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [[told the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Nineteenth National Congress of the [C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist
[P]{.mark}arty that [Beijing could]{.mark}]{.underline} now "**[[take
center stage]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}**" [[and act as an
**alternative** to **U.S. leadership**]{.underline}]{.mark}.38

These ambitions may or may not be realistic. But they demonstrate just
how significantly the world's leading authoritarian powers desire to
shift the global environment over time. The
**[[revisionism]{.underline}]{.mark}** we are seeing today [[may]{.mark}
therefore [be **only the beginning**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
[[China]{.mark}'s power **continues to grow,** or if it is successful in
**dominating the Western Pacific**, it [will]{.mark} **surely [move
on]{.mark}** [to **grander endeavors**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If Russia
reconsolidates control over the former Soviet space, it may seek to
bring parts of the former Warsaw Pact to heel. Historically, [this has
been a recurring pattern of **great-power behavior**---interests
**expand with power**, the appetite **grows** with the eating,
**risk-taking** increases as **early gambles** are seen to **pay
off**]{.underline}.39 This pattern is precisely why the revival of
great-power competition is so concerning---because [**[geopolitical
revisionism]{.mark}** by **unsatisfied major powers** [has]{.mark} so
often [presaged **intensifying international
conflict**]{.mark},]{.underline} confrontation,
[[and]{.mark}]{.underline} even **[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
great-power behavior occurring today represents the warning light
flashing on the dashboard. It tells us there may be still-greater
traumas to come.

The threats today are compelling and urgent, and there may someday come
a time when the balance of power has shifted so markedly that the
postwar international system cannot be sustained. Yet that moment of
failure has not yet arrived, and so the goal of U.S. strategy should be
not to hasten it by giving up prematurely, but to push it off as far
into the future as possible. Rather [than simply
**acquiescing**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the
**[decline]{.underline}** of a world it spent generations building,
[[America should]{.mark} **aggressively [bolster its
defenses]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} with an eye to **preserving** and perhaps
even selectively **advancing** its remarkable achievements.]{.underline}

#### A [receding]{.underline} US deterrent is a [catalyst]{.underline} for [great-power conflict]{.underline} --- decline causes [transition wars]{.underline} and [miscalculation]{.underline}.

Moreover, [[if discussions of]{.mark} "[international order]{.mark}"
[can]{.mark} quickly [take on an **abstract quality**, the
**consequences of collapse**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[the **lives
lost**]{.underline} or ruptured, the prosperity destroyed, [the **moral
depravities** committed]{.underline}---[[can be **frighteningly
concrete**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thucydides had it right when he
described what happens in such a vacuum of security and morality: "Death
thus raged in every shape ... there was no length to which violence did
not go."3 This is all indisputably ~~depressing~~, but it should not be
the least bit surprising. If it were possible to construct an
international system that was truly universal in its appeal; if it were
possible to freeze global power relationships at that moment of
creation; [[if it were possible for states to **put aside the**]{.mark}
very human ambitions, emotions, and [**fears** that **drive their
behavior**]{.mark}:]{.underline} [then, perhaps, [the world
could]{.mark} **permanently [escape]{.mark}** the **[competitive
impulses]{.mark}** that make international orders **impermanent** and
their demise **so traumatic**]{.underline}. [[**But**]{.mark} **none of
this** has **ever** been possible]{.underline}. [**International
orders**, even the most **inclusive** ones, create winners and losers
because they benefit states **unequally**.]{.underline} [The power
balances that underpin a given system **shift over time**, encouraging
**new tests of strength**]{.underline}. And although the human desire
for peace and prosperity is strong, [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[remain **motivated** by]{.underline}]{.mark} ideological passion,
greed, and **[[insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The most **successful
orders** can mitigate the **effects** of these dynamics]{.underline};
they can suppress the sources of conflict and upheaval. [But they cannot
**eliminate them entirely**.]{.underline} This point is essential in
considering the trajectory of the post-1945 order. [It is tempting for
individuals in nearly every geopolitical era to believe that their world
is somehow different---that it is **immune** to the **dangers of
conflict** and **collapse**]{.underline}. [It is **alluring** to think
that progress can be **self-sustaining**, and that **liberal principles
can triumph** even if liberal **actors** are **no longer
preeminent**.]{.underline} To do so, however, is to fall prey to the
same ahistorical mindset that so predictably precedes the fall. Yes,
[the American order is **exceptional** in the level of **stability,
prosperity**, and **liberal dominance** it has provided]{.underline},
and in the level of consent it has generated from countries around the
world. [Yet it is **not so exceptional** as to be **exempt** from the
dangers of decline and decay.]{.underline} As the Greeks surely would
have realized, in fact, it is precisely when one succumbs to the
illusion that tragedy is impossible that tragedy becomes all the more
likely. II This leads to a second component of a tragic sensibility---an
appreciation that tragedy is once again stalking global affairs. The
U.S.-led system is undoubtedly strong and resilient in many respects, as
shown by the simple fact that it has survived as long as it has. Yet
what endured in the past is not destined to endure in the future, and
today the structure is groaning as the stresses mount. [**Long-standing
principles** such as **nonaggression** and **freedom of** **navigation**
are being **undermined** from Eastern Europe to the South China
Sea]{.underline}. International predators like North Korea and radical
jihadist groups are using creative, asymmetric strategies to cause
geopolitical disruption out of all proportion to their material power.
The democratic wave has receded amid the growing prevalence and power of
authoritarianism. [**[Revisionist]{.mark} autocracie[s]{.mark}**
[are]{.mark} **[reshaping regional environments]{.mark}** in Europe, the
Middle East, and East Asia, [and]{.mark} waging **sophisticated
assaults** against the **political systems** and **geopolitical
positions** of their **competitors**]{.underline}. [These countries are
[building]{.mark} **privileged [spheres of influence]{.mark}** in
**critical areas** of the globe;]{.underline} they are casting ever
longer shadows, both strategic and ideological, across the international
landscape. Meanwhile, the countries with the most to lose should the
current system crack are too often divided and demoralized; their
strategic torpor and distraction are creating vacuums that the
revisionists are all too happy to fill. The protectors of the post-1945
order seem stuck in neutral, or even reverse, as the attackers push
forward. This has historically been a dangerous combination. [Faced with
this **daunting panorama**, some analysts will take refuge in the hope
that these challenges will simply **exhaust themselves**, or that
revisionist powers will be satiated once their **regional ambitions are
fulfilled**]{.underline}. [Yet most systems tend toward **more**, rather
than **less, entropy over time**, meaning that more, rather than less,
**energy** is **required to stabilize them**]{.underline}. And
[[**revisionist powers** **rarely**]{.mark} reach some **natural point
at** which their aspirations **[subside]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [[those
aspirations often **grow** with **each success**]{.underline}]{.mark}.4
Today, the dissatisfied dictatorships, especially [**Russia** and
**China**]{.underline}, [see themselves as being locked in a form of
**geopolitical conflict** with the **United States**;]{.underline} [they
are already using **force** and]{.underline} other types of
[**coercion** to **chip away** at the American order]{.underline}.
[[Should they succeed in **claiming regional primacy** and
reestablishing a **spheres-of-influence world**, the result
would]{.mark} be not to **dampen** but to [**inflame international
conflict.** **Competition**]{.mark} among the great powers [would
**intensify** as **hostile spheres rub up against one another**]{.mark};
the security of the **global commons---**the **foundation** of
**international prosperity**---would be threatened by **escalating
geopolitical rivalry**]{.underline}. The prospects for
self-determination and liberalism would fade as small states fall under
the sway of stronger, authoritarian neighbors. And crucially, as Daniel
Twining notes, [[**regional dominance** could serve as a "**springboard
for global contestation**"]{.mark}---for the **renewed clashes for
systemic dominance**]{.underline} that Americans thought they had left
behind with the end of the Cold War.5 It is impossible to predict
precisely when the pressures on the existing order might become
unbearable, or to know how close we are to that critical inflection
point at which the dangers metastasize and the pace of decay
dramatically accelerates. One can only speculate what the terminal
crisis of the system will look like if and when it occurs. What is clear
is that the [**telltale signs of erosion** are **already ubiquitous**
and the trend-lines are **running in the wrong direction**]{.underline}.
The first step toward recovery is admitting you have a problem. Having a
tragic sensibility requires seeing the world for what it is and where it
is going, especially when the outlook is ominous. III If the
international order is under strain, [however, it does not follow that
its **collapse is unavoidable**]{.underline}. Here a third aspect of a
tragic sensibility is vital: the ability to reject complacency without
falling into fatalism. Nietzsche defined tragic pleasure as the
"reaffirmation of the will to live in the face of death."6 It was just
such a rejection of fatalism---of the belief that the next great global
crackup was inevitable---that motivated U.S. policymakers to create the
post-1945 order and sustain it through the crises that followed. Today,
it is true enough that the grandest aspirations of the post--Cold War
era are unlikely to be fulfilled anytime soon. Given the instability and
revisionism roiling the international environment, it is simply beyond
America's power---if it was ever possible in the first place---to create
a truly global order in which liberal values are universal, geopolitical
competition has ceased, and authoritarian rivals have been fully
pacified and converted into "responsible stakeholders." Yet the existing
international order, incomplete and threatened as it is, still
constitutes a remarkable historical achievement. [The creation of a
**global balance of power** that favors]{.underline} the democracies,
[the prevention of **unchecked aggression** and
**intimidation**]{.underline} by predatory powers, [and the promotion of
a **prosperous** and an **integrated world** in which liberal values
have achieved **great prevalence** are **all triumphs worth
preservin**g]{.underline}. [[A]{.mark} more **[reasonable
goal]{.mark}**]{.underline}, then, [[would be to **defend this existing
order**]{.mark} against the depredations of those attacking it, and
[America **undoubtedly has the power** for this]{.mark} **essential
[undertaking]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### AT: China Leadership Good

#### Letting China surpass the US ensures [geopolitical chaos]{.underline} and [great-power war]{.underline}. 

**Glickman, 18** --- Gabriel Glickman is a nonresident associate fellow
at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, Bar-Ilan University.
(2-12-2018; \"Back to the Future: The Potential of Great-Power
Conflict;\" *National Interest*;
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/back-the-future-the-potential-great-power-conflict-24464;
//GrRv)

What does the DOD mean by "order?" In the field of international
relations, the terms "revisionist state" and "status-quo state" are used
to describe, respectively, countries that seek to change the current
international system and those that uphold it. In the twentieth and
twenty-first centuries, [the international system has been defined by
**American hegemony** and the **spread** of]{.underline} Western liberal
**[democracy]{.underline}** rather than its challengers---notably,
fascism and socialism. [This is]{.underline} commonly referred to as
[the **liberal world order.**]{.underline}

Under that world order, [the United States]{.underline} is the most
powerful country in the world. It often intervenes in international
conflicts at a high cost, thus [keep]{.underline}ing [**dissatisfied
nations** from **overturning the system**]{.underline}. The NDS,
however, refers to a recent shift in the current world order with an
observation that, "[[We are facing **global disorder**, characterized by
**decline** in the]{.underline}]{.mark} long-standing rules-based
[[international order]{.underline}]{.mark}."

The basis for that observation is the argument that the United States
under the Obama administration took a brief, but arguably consequential,
step back from the job of world-order maintenance. As proof of this,
foreign-policy pundits often refer to Obama's favorite quote (which he
got from Martin Luther King Jr., who in turn got it from a
nineteenth-century clergyman named Theodore Parker): "\[T\]he arc of the
moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice." The implication of
this quote is that history is ultimately on the side of good rather than
evil (e.g., dictatorships), and therefore the United States needn't
concern itself with great power competition or world order strategy.
Critics point out that the president's faith in that sentiment was put
to poor use, however, because it led him to apologize for American power
and to enact [a more **restrained foreign policy** that in turn allowed
**revisionist states** like Russia, China and Iran to **flourish** at
the expense of their respective regions' security]{.underline}. As
Charles Krauthammer harshly wrote in the final months of the
administration: "[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} consequent **[[withdrawal of
American power]{.underline}]{.mark}** ... [[has
yielded]{.underline}]{.mark} nothing but [[**geopolitical chaos** and
**immense human suffering**]{.underline}]{.mark}. (See Syria.)."

And that\'s not exactly a partisan argument either. In addition to
conservative critics like Krauthammer, left-leaning foreign policy
scholars, like Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institute, also have been
critical of the results of the Obama administration\'s well-intentioned
foreign policy.

The NDS promises to reverse the "arc of history" approach to security
policy with a three-tiered approach that prioritizes the "revisionist
powers" of China and Russia, then "rogue regimes" like Iran and North
Korea, and finally "nonstate actors" such as ISIS.

Of course, this new approach may alleviate serious concerns about the
NSS---including my own---that the United States government no longer
cares about global security. But policy will only follow well-written
sentiment if President Trump himself can accept that [America is the
**glue** holding together an **entire world order**]{.underline}.

[With China **now poised** to **reclaim its previous spot** in world
history as a global hegemon, the proverbial clock is turning
back]{.underline}. And that appears to be the reason why the DOD is
serious about America being in the business of world order maintenance.
As stated in the NDS: "Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism,
is now the primary concern in U.S. national security."

Indeed, [China already has a **strong economy**. It represents almost
**15 percent** of the **global GDP**]{.underline} to America's roughly
24 percent. But, to put that in a slightly different perspective, China
has grown astronomically in the last decade to overtake Japan as the
second largest global economy. [Thus, [there is a real possibility that
in the near future]{.mark}]{.underline} (likely decades) [[it may be
able to surpass even the United States and]{.mark} then harness its
capital to [develop **superior military
tech**]{.mark}**nology**]{.underline}. [[At **that point,** China
would]{.mark} be capable of **[overthrow]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} current
[international system.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[The world has **not seen global conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} the
likes of World War I and II [[since the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[became the **dominant power**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nor, for that
matter, has it seen a recurrence of the great power conflicts of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As the new defense strategy
implies, [[take **U.S. hegemony** out of that equation and **great
powers** may **clash** ]{.mark}**once again** to the detriment of a
cherished world order.]{.underline}

### AT: Multipolarity

#### Multipolarity fails---it generates violent fill in and risks nuclear war

**Kagan 19**---(Robert Kagan, Senior fellow at the Brookings Institute
and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, "The Jungle Grows
Back: America and Our Imperiled World", Alfred A. Knopf)//ND

At the root of such thinking is the belief that there is an escape from
power or that it is possible to wield power without error and without
failure. [Americans]{.underline}, blessed by their favorable geography
and wealth, still [believe they have a choice between engaging the world
and letting the world fend for itself]{.underline}. [There has been no
shortage of realists, idealists, progressives, and conservatives telling
them that substantially disengaging from our alliances and overseas
commitments is possible and cost-free]{.underline}. But the real choice
we face is not between the good and the bad but between the bad and the
worse. [It is between maintaining the liberal world order,]{.underline}
with all the moral and material costs that entails[, or letting it
collapse and courting the catastrophes that must inevitably follow.
**What is likely to follow is a return to the multipolar power struggles
that brought so much devastation to the world before the United States
redirected the course of history.**]{.underline} That is where the deep
ruts lead, back to the state of the world prior to 1945. [Only this
time, the powers competing and clashing will be armed with nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} It is ironic that some of those who spent the Cold
War warning that America's hawkish foreign policies would result in
nuclear holocaust do not seem "democracies would result in nuclear
holocaust do not seem to fear nuclear war in the competitive multipolar
world that may be our future. We have yet to test the question of
whether nations with nuclear weapons can go to war, because so far the
United States and the liberal world order have prevented such wars. But
[if history is any guide, to count on the horror of new weaponry alone
to maintain the peace is a most risky bet.]{.underline} Had you cast
that bet before the two world wars, you would have lost. These days some
experts tell us [it was the existence of nuclear weapons that prevented
the United States and the Soviet Union from coming to blows, but few at
the time had any confidence that nuclear weapons were a guarantor of
peace.]{.underline} Throughout much of the Cold War there were those who
simply assumed that the world was heading inevitably toward Armageddon.
They were wrong that it would come as a result of American Cold War
policies, but in the long run they may still prove right.

### China Revisionist

#### China is revisionist -- territorial expansion, 5-year plans, and anti-democratic innovation on all fronts

ENTER THE DRAGON There has never been any doubt about what China wants,
because [Chinese leaders have declared the same objectives for decades:
to keep the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in power, reabsorb Taiwan,
control the East China and South China Seas, and return China to its
rightful place as the dominant power in Asia]{.underline} and the most
powerful country in the world. For most of the past four decades, the
country took a relatively patient and peaceful approach to achieving
these aims. Focused on economic growth and fearful of being shunned by
the international community, China adopted a "peaceful rise" strategy,
relying primarily on economic clout to advance its interests and
generally following a maxim of the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping: "Hide
your strength, bide your time." In recent years, however, [China has
expanded aggressively on multiple fronts. "Wolf Warrior" diplomacy has
replaced friendship diplomacy. Perceived slights from foreigners, no
matter how small, are met with North Korean--style
condemnation]{.underline}. A combative attitude has seeped into every
part of China's foreign policy, and it is confronting many countries
with their gravest threat in generations. This threat is [most apparent
in maritime East Asia, where China is moving aggressively to cement its
vast territorial claims. Beijing is churning out warships faster than
any country has since World War II, and it has flooded Asian sea-lanes
with Chinese coast guard and fishing vessel]{.underline}s. It has
[strung military outposts across the South China Sea and dramatically
increased its use of ship ramming and aerial interceptions]{.underline}
to shove neighbors out of disputed areas. In the Taiwan Strait[, Chinese
military patrols, some involving a dozen warships and more than 50
combat aircraft, prowl the sea almost daily and simulate attacks on
Taiwanese and U.S. targets.]{.underline} [Chinese officials have told
Western analysts that calls for an invasion of Taiwan are proliferating
within the CCP.]{.underline} Pentagon officials worry that such an
assault could be imminent. C[hina has gone on the economic offensive,
too. Its latest five-year plan calls for dominating what Chinese
officials call "chokepoints"---goods and services that other countries
can't live without]{.underline}---and then using that dominance, plus
the lure of China's domestic market, to browbeat countries into
concessions. Toward that end[, China has become the dominant dispenser
of overseas loans, loading up more than 150 countries with over \$1
trillion of debt.]{.underline} It [has massively subsidized strategic
industries to gain a monopoly on hundreds of vital products, and it has
installed the hardware for digital networks in dozens of
countries]{.underline}. Armed with economic leverage, it has used
coercion against more than a dozen countries over the last few years. In
many cases, the punishment has been disproportionate to the supposed
crime---for example, slapping tariffs on many of Australia's exports
after that country requested an international investigation into the
origins of COVID-19. [China has also become a potent antidemocratic
force, selling advanced tools of tyranny around the world. By combining
surveillance cameras with social media monitoring, artificial
intelligence, biometrics, and speech and facial recognition
technologies]{.underline}, the Chinese government has pioneered a system
that allows dictators to watch citizens constantly and punish them
instantly by blocking their access to finance, education, employment,
telecommunications, or travel. The apparatus is a despot's dream, and
Chinese companies are already selling and operating aspects of it in
more than 80 countries.

#### Western encirclement, aging populations, and attempted expansion prove China is a volatile revisionist power on the verge of lash-out

Red Flags [Most debate on America\'s China policy focuses on the dangers
of a rising and confident China.]{.underline}3 But the [United States
actually faces a more complex and volatile threat]{.underline}: an
already [powerful but increasingly insecure China beset by internal
problems and a brewing international backlash]{.underline}. [China
already has the money and muscle to challenge the United
States]{.underline} in key areas. Thanks to decades of rapid growth[,
China boasts the world\'s largest economy]{.underline} (measured by
purchasing power parity), [manufacturing output, trade surplus,
financial reserves, navy by number of ships, and conventional missile
force]{.underline}. [Chinese nationals lead four of the 15 United
Nations specialized agencies.4 Chinese investments and loans span the
globe, and Beijing is pushing for primacy in key technologies such as 5G
telecommunications and artificial intelligence]{.underline} (AI).5 Add
in that the American-led world order has experienced four years of
geopolitical disarray under President Donald Trump and that much of the
world has suffered through many months of a crippling COVID-19 pandemic,
and it is [hardly surprising that Beijing is testing the status quo
everywhere from the South China Sea to the border with
China]{.underline}. But [China\'s geopolitical window of opportunity may
be closing as fast as it opened. Since 2007, China\'s annual economic
growth rate has dropped by more than half]{.underline}, and
[productivity has declined by nearly 10 percent]{.underline}, meaning
that [China is spending more to produce less]{.underline}.6 Meanwhile,
[debt has ballooned eightfold]{.underline} and is on pace to total 335
percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2020.7 No country has
racked up so much debt so fast in peacetime. [China has little hope of
reversing these trends, because it is about to suffer the worst aging
crisis in history]{.underline}. Over the next 30 years, [China will lose
200 million working-age adults and gain 300 million senior
citizens]{.underline}./8 Any country that has aged, accu-mulated debt,
or lost productivity at anything close to China\'s current pace has lost
at least one decade to near-zero economic growth. And [as economic
growth falls, the dangers of social and political unrest rise./9
China\'s leaders are well aware of these trends./10 President Xi Jinping
has given multiple internal speeches warning party members of the
potential for a Soviet-style collapse./11 China\'s gov-ernment has
outlawed negative economic news, and Chinese elites are moving their
money and children out of the country en masse./]{.underline}12
Meanwhile, [China faces a rising wave of foreign hostility. According to
leaked Chinese government reports and independent Western analyses,
nega-tive views of China have soared to highs not seen since the
Tiananmen Square massacre]{.underline} of 1989./13 This surge of
anti-China sentiment [is a response to Beijing\'s internal repression
and external assertiveness]{.underline}, and it is [now manifesting in
ways that threaten to crush China\'s geopolitical ambitions. Nearly a
dozen countries have suspended or canceled their participation in Belt
and Road Initiative projects]{.underline}./14 Another 16 countries,
including [eight of the world\'s 10 largest economies, have banned or
severely restricted use of Huawei products]{.underline} in their 5G
networks./15 [India has been turning hard against China,]{.underline}
since a clash between the two countries killed 20 soldiers in June.
[Japan has ramped up military spending, turned amphibious ships into
aircraft carriers,]{.underline} and strung missile launchers along the
Ryukyu Islands near Taiwan, where a record number of citizens now
identify solely as Taiwanese, not Chinese./[16 The European Union has
labeled China a \"systemic rival,\" and Europe\'s three great
powers\--France, Germany, and the United Kingdom\--are sending naval
patrols to counter Beijing\'s expansion]{.underline} in the South China
Sea and Indian Ocean./17 These [intensifying headwinds will make China a
less competitive long-term rival to the United States but a more
explosive **near-term threat**]{.underline}. Simply put, [it is hard to
see how a country facing so many severe challenges can ultimately
outpace America and its many allies.]{.underline} Yet whereas a rising
[China could afford to shelve disputes and deescalate
crises]{.underline}\--confident that its wealth, power, and status were
growing and that the Chinese Communist Party\'s (CCP) legitimacy was
secure\--[a slowing and increasingly encircled China will be eager to
score geopolitical wins while it still can.]{.underline} There is no
mystery about what China\'s ambitions are, because [the CCP has
enshrined them in national law: to make the Chinese nation whole again;
reunite Taiwan with the mainland; control the East and South China Seas,
thereby turning the western Pacific into a Chinese lake]{.underline};
and restore China\'s status as a great power. [The looming danger is
that China will act more aggressively to achieve them]{.underline} as
its future prospects dim. History Rhymes If China goes down this ugly
path, it wouldn\'t be the first great power to do so. [We tend to think
that rising revisionists pose the greatest danger to the existing
order]{.underline}. \"[It was the rise of Athens and the **fear that
this inspired in Sparta** that made war inevitable,\"]{.underline}
Thucydides wrote. But historically, the most desperate dashes have often
come from dissatisfied powers that had been on the ascent but grew
worried that their time was running short./18 World War I is the classic
example. The growing German challenge to the United Kingdom provided the
strategic background to that conflict. Yet in the foreground in the
run-up to 1914 were nagging German fears of decline. The growth of
Russian military power and strategic mobility was menacing the eastern
flank. New French conscription laws were changing the balance in the
west. A tightening Franco-Russian-British entente was leaving Germany
surrounded. If Berlin did not act quickly, its military strategy\--based
on fighting a two-front war\--would collapse, its dreams of world power
and geopolitical greatness would vanish, and the internal strains caused
by intensifying political clashes might become unmanageable. This was a
principal reason Berlin acted so recklessly during the July crisis\--by
issuing its \"blank check\" to Austria-Hungary and then enacting its
plan for a rapid, two-front war\--despite the obvious peril, as Chief of
General Staff Helmut von Moltke acknowledged, of a continental war that
might \"annihilate the civilization of almost the whole of Europe for
decades to come.\"/19 The same decision-making dynamics were present in
other cases. Imperial Japan made its fatal gamble in 1941, after the US
oil embargo and naval rearma-ment made it clear that Tokyo\'s window to
dominate the Asia-Pacific was closing fast./20 In the 1970s, Soviet
global expansion peaked as Moscow\'s military buildup matured and the
slowing of the Soviet economy created an impetus to lock in geopolitical
gains sooner than later. Even the United States once fit this pattern.
The flurry of American expansion and the buildup of US naval power in
the 1890s came after an economic slump that exacerbated internal
tensions and amid a global upsurge of imperial aggran-dizement that left
some US strategists concerned that Washington would be left behind by
emerging European mega-empires. In some of these instances, [it was
economic dis-tress following a long period of growth that stoked anxious
aggression. In others, it was the onset of strategic encirclement, often
self-provoked, by rival powers]{.underline}. [In all cases, an upsurge
in a revisionist state\'s power gave it the means to challenge the
status quo, but an apparent downturn in its future prospects gave it the
motive to do so boldly, even violently]{.underline}. Given that C[hina
is currently facing both a grim economic forecast and tightening
strategic encirclement, the next few years may prove partic-ularly
turbulent.]{.underline}/21

## Russia Alliance Impact Answers

[[Institutionalization of the Beijing--Moscow relationship remains
low]{.mark}, but a pattern of regular consultation between top leaders
has evolved. [Russia and China also meet annually for bilateral military
and technical co-operation talks]{.mark}]{.underline}, and have
continued to develop the Shanghai Cooperation Organization founded in
2001. China--Russia strategic convergence is a discernible trend which
will gain further momentum. However, **[[strategic convergence should
not be confused with an alliance, and China and Russia are not perfect
strategic partners]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Developments inside China and
Russia are crucial to how the relationship develops. Key questions are
whether political stability will prevail and whether rapid growth can be
sustained. Trenin argues that a **[[Sino--Russian alliance could occur
only as a result of "exceptionally short-sighted and foolish
policies]{.mark} on China and Russia are not pro-Western, but neither
are they definitively anti-Western.]{.underline}** Western policymakers
who are worried about the implications of Sino--Russian strategic
convergence would do well to pursue a policy of engaging both Moscow and
Beijing, and put pressure on Tokyo to resolve the dispute over the
Kurile Islands. Paradoxically, if an alliance, or something resembling
an alliance, were to be formed this could lead to a breakdown of the
relationship in the medium to long term. [China and Russia both command
sufficient resources and sophistication to be significant global powers
in their own right, and they certainly consider themselves as such.
[China was unwilling to subordinate itself to Russia for more than a
brief period after the Communists came to power in 1949,]{.mark} and
Russia would refuse to subordinate itself to China. The most likely
scenario is Sino--Russo strategic convergence based on a relationship of
mutual self-interest]{.underline}. The evidence presented in this
article indicates that trade and investment between China and Russia are
set to continue to grow rapidly, particularly in the energy sector,
further enhancing the significance of the relationship. [[While Beijing
and Moscow have common interests in placing restraints on the power of
the United States]{.mark}, the creation of a full-fledged anti-Western
alliance is unlikely to prove viable in the short term. Russia and
especially China are [both dependent on open access to Western markets
to sustain growth.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Inevitable

#### China will support Russia regardless of how the Ukraine conflict develops 

**Blanchette 22**(Jude Blanchette holds the Freeman chair in China
studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, "The
worse things go for Putin in Ukraine, the more China will back him," The
Washington Post, March 24, 2022 at 4:09 p.m. EDT,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/24/xi-jinping-putin-china-russia-sanctions/>) -
MP

China has tried to have it both ways since Russia invaded Ukraine a
month ago. It abstained from key votes at the United Nations criticizing
Russia's actions, avoided directly labeling President Vladimir Putin's
assault on Ukraine an "invasion," amplified Russian disinformation and
repeatedly laid blame for the war at the feet of the United States and
NATO. At the same time, Beijing has also largely complied with sanctions
against Russia, made repeated, if vague, calls for a negotiated
settlement to the hostilities and provided humanitarian assistance to
Ukraine. But make no mistake: [The worse it goes for Russia in Ukraine,
the more China will step up its support for the Putin regime. Beijing's
uneven diplomatic strategy may seem to stem from a desire to achieve
multiple, often conflicting aims, most notably to forestall a
deterioration in relations with Europe.]{.underline} Not all objectives
are weighted equally, however, and as the war enters a more protracted
and destructive phase, [China's primary goal is coming into focus: to
ensure that Russia retains its status as Beijing's key strategic
partner, even if this necessitates paying serious economic and
diplomatic costs. Beijing will see the prospect of a Russian defeat as a
direct threat to its own territorial security and ability to compete
head-to-head in the geopolitical rivalry with the United
States]{.underline} --- and China simply can't allow that to happen. To
see why Beijing has a direct stake in the war's outcome, it's critical
to understand how its relationship with Russia has evolved since the
collapse of the Soviet Union, and how China views the global security
environment evolving over the next three to five years. Since the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, China and Russia
have experienced significant friction and mutual mistrust. The nadir of
the relationship came in 1969, when the two communist powers nearly
engaged in a nuclear war. Since 1989, however, Beijing and Moscow have
systematically addressed the major points of contention in their
relationship, including any lingering territorial disputes. In 2001, the
countries signed the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly
Cooperation, and after Chinese leader Xi Jinping assumed power in 2013,
cooperation has expanded to include joint military exercises, efforts to
reform global governance and technology sharing[. For example, the two
countries continue to develop a satellite navigation system to rival the
United States' GPS, and in January, Russia and China, along with Iran,
held a series of naval drills in the Indian Ocean]{.underline}. This
growing symbiosis was formalized on Feb. 4 in a joint statement issued
during Putin's visit to Beijing at the start of the Winter Olympics
(Xi's meeting with Putin then was his first with a world leader since
February 2020, when he appeared with the Mongolian prime minister in
Beijing). Stretching more than 5,000 words, the joint statement
encapsulated a shared worldview between two authoritarian powers and two
autocratic leaders. The global order is undergoing "momentous changes,"
the statement read, which include a "transformation of the global
governance architecture and world order" and "global challenges and
threats growing from day to day." But perhaps more important, the joint
statement articulated a shared grievance that the United States and its
allies threaten Chinese and Russian interests and global aspirations.
NATO, the document states, promotes an "ideologized cold war approach,"
while the U.S. "Indo-Pacific strategy" endangers the "peace and
stability in the region." [Before Russia had even invaded Ukraine, then,
Beijing had come to see Moscow as a critical security and strategic
partner in the growing power rivalry with the United States and its
allies in Europe and Asia]{.underline}. More to the point, Russia is
China's only real military and strategic partner. Although tensions
exist in the bilateral relationship, not least because of the growing
economic gap between their economies, the broader geopolitical
chessboard draws Moscow and Beijing together. What's more, [Putin and Xi
have a close relationship --- they've met in person or virtually nearly
40 times in the decade that Xi has been in power. Time is running out
for China The war in Ukraine has undoubtedly thrown Beijing off balance,
and Chinese officials certainly didn't want Putin to invade in the first
place, but the basic math underlying this strategic partnership with
Moscow has not changed]{.underline}. Indeed, the war has only
consolidated Beijing's central logic for supporting Russia, given the
recent demonstration of Western diplomatic unity, the overwhelming power
of U.S.-led sanctions and the reinvigoration of NATO. The former editor
of the Chinese nationalist Global Times newspaper, Hu Xijin, argued in
recent commentary that ["if the U.S. pursues extreme strategic coercion
against China, with Russia as a partner, China will not fear a U.S.
energy blockade, our food supplies will be more secure, as will \[our
supplies\] of many other raw materials]{.underline}." In a speech last
weekend, China's vice foreign minister Le Yucheng drew a straight line
between NATO in Europe and China's own security concerns, warning that
just as Moscow's actions in Ukraine were a direct consequence of NATO
expansion, any actions by NATO in the Asia-Pacific region would provoke
similar consequences, and thus, the "crisis in Ukraine is a stern
warning." Beyond the substantive reasons underlying China's support for
Russia, there is also Beijing's unwillingness to be seen as submitting
to the U.S. demand that it back away from Moscow. As one Chinese Russia
expert at the Shanghai International Studies University observed, "If
China goes along with the U.S. against Russia, it will not only greatly
strengthen the anti-Russian camp, but will also be a huge boost to the
U.S. 'leadership.' " The key question now is just how far Beijing will
go to support Moscow. While Xi would like to maintain good relations
with Europe and avoid a further deterioration in the U.S.-China
relationship, [the fate of Putin and the Russian state directly
implicates China's core security interests.]{.underline} Not only would
the prospect of a beaten and broken Russia activate China's fears of
instability along their shared 2,500-mile border, but it would also
create uncertainty about the future leadership and geopolitical
orientation of the Russian government. If Putin were eventually to fall
from power, would his successor remain aligned with Beijing? So the more
anxious Beijing becomes about the war and Putin's personal position in
power, the more likely it is to step up support by providing direct
economic assistance, mitigating the impact of sanctions and even
supplying military equipment. Clearly, China's preference is to avoid
secondary sanctions in response to any support --- access to the
international market and the U.S. dollar remains critical for China's
economy and its continued rise. [But Beijing could pursue means of
support that are difficult to track, such as facilitating Russia's
access to U.S. dollars via offshore accounts, or by directing
state-owned enterprises and even private companies to increase their
purchases of non-sanctioned Russian goods and services]{.underline}. If
[China]{.underline} does decide to supply Russia with military
assistance, it [would likely seek to avoid equipment and hardware that
would flagrantly violate international law and sanctions or be easily
traceable, and instead provide spare parts, ammunition or certain
dual-use items that aren't yet sanctioned]{.underline}. But critically,
the decision to provide aid to Russia would be driven primarily by
Beijing's assessment of how Russia is faring in the war, rather than a
desire to avoid paying economic or diplomatic costs. Unfortunately, it
is difficult to imagine that Beijing is watching the conflict unfold
without growing more nervous by the day: Russia has failed to achieve
any of its major military or political objectives. In just the past
week, the Russian military has escalated its offensive to include a
wider number of indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets, and
President Biden is also now warning of "clear signs" that Putin is
considering using chemical weapons. Domestically, Putin has begun to
purge his inner circle, arresting some within the security services and
senior officials in the national guard. Beijing will see this as a sign
that Putin's grip is weakening, and as the sanctions continue to
decimate Russia's economy, anxiety in China is only likely to grow.
Succession plans protect nations. Putin and Xi just threw theirs out.
[Some analysts suggest that China may well see Russia's recent weakening
in the wake of sanctions as a net positive, as it shifts the balance of
power in the relationship in Beijing's favor]{.underline}. A tangible
benefit of such a shift would be Beijing's ability to demand more
favorable terms in buying Russian energy. While it's true that Beijing
leveraged Moscow's economic and diplomatic isolation after Russia
annexed Crimea in 2014 to gain better terms in several large energy
deals, the security environment for China in 2022 is far more
contentious than it was in 2014, and Moscow's true value is its
ideological orientation and military capabilities as much as its energy
stores. Xi does not want a weak Russia for a security and strategic
partner. If Beijing turns toward and not away from Moscow as the war
grinds on and the extent of human suffering increases, the basic
trajectory of [China's relations with the West will undergo a profound
shift toward open rivalry]{.underline}. It would be comforting to think
that [the prospect of such a disastrous turn would be enough to dissuade
the Chinese leadership from traveling down this path]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, though, [Beijing's geopolitical outlook for the next
decade]{.underline} --- much like Washington's --- [includes conflict
and friction as defining features.]{.underline}

### Russia-China Good Turn

#### Russia-Chinese alliance key to prevent border conflicts -- without dialogue, the tensions would mirror the sino-soviet border wars

**Crossley 2/27** \[Pamela Kyle Crossley - Collis Professor of History,
Dartmouth College, \"Are China and Russia Forging a New Ideological
Bloc?\",
https://www.chinafile.com/conversation/are-china-and-russia-forging-new-ideological-bloc,
DOA: 6/25/16\]

Ambassador Wu\'s reference to the absurdity of an \"ideological bloc\"
is interesting, and in the sense of "ideology" as sometimes used in
policy circles the prospect does seem absurd. [But there has been some
convergence of strategic conceptualization between the sequence of
governments based in Beijing and in Moscow since at least 1689, when
they began their own history of diplomatic exchange, and since that time
[they have successfully negotiated the maintenance of their nearly 3,000
miles of shared borders]{.mark}. It has not been simple or uniformly
peaceful, and the idea that two enormous countries sharing centuries of
successfully resolved tensions between their ancestral empires without
emerging with some common ideas about trade regulation and taxation,
environmental management, migration controls and maintenance of security
is not entirely credible]{.underline}. Those could amount to an ideology
of a positive sort, as contrasted to mere suspicion of and opposition to
the United States, a sort of negative ideology. There are clearly
grounds for alliance between Russia and China based on stable shared
perspectives and interests rather than only a shared opponent. The
question of China's dense population accumulation on one side of the
border and Russia's expanses of lightly inhabited and under-developed
territory on the other presents as many possibilities for cooperation as
for conflict. The same is true for the faltering of the regime in North
Korea, the problems of resource exploitation and transport in Central
Asia, the management of sea and air dominance of the western Pacific,
the development of programs for exploitation of space and the moon, and
financial and commercial initiatives in Europe, among other issues.
[[Russia and China have every reason to explore mutually-disciplined
expansion on all fronts at the expense,]{.mark} if possible, [of the
United States and Japan]{.mark}, and history suggests that the rewards
are great enough that both parties will have reason to accept such a
program**. [The possibility of disenchantment on either side will always
be present. Each can cite grievances against the other if needed, from
the First United Front to the Korean War to the Sino-Soviet split to
border disputes]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The greatest danger may come not
from the complexities of their roles in the wider world but from the
relative stabilities of their governments. Slippage by either would
raise the question of support from the other, or exploitation of a
crisis to in order to sponsor a new and perhaps dependent ---or at least
obliged--- new regime. [Their pasts, in other words, look a bit more
solid than their futures. [Where they seek friendship they could find
betrayal]{.mark}.]{.underline} But their history suggests that whether
empires or republics they have an underlying understanding of what it is
to be expansive on the Asian continent, to be enemies of Japan, and to
live in tension with whatever they mean by "the West." Why they would
need "ideology" to further consolidate their affinity is not clear, but
realization of what they have in common could be an ideology in itself.

#### Another sino-soviet border dispute causes nuclear war -- US gets drawn in when Russia or china attack each other

**Bolton 10** \[Kerry R Bolton, \"Sino-Soviet-US Relations and the 1969
Nuclear Threat\",
www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/05/17/sino-soviet-us-relations-and-the-1969-nuclear-threat/,
DOA: 6/25/16\]

[The mainstream press has just come out with a Chinese expose that has
informed an undoubtedly surprised world that in 1969 [the USSR wished to
settle its historical score with China and launch a nuclear
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. The USSR merely wanted an assurance of U.S.
neutrality. Far from the USA welcoming this de-clawing of the growing
dragon, it instead threatened that there would be retaliation from the
U.S. against Russia. According to a report first carried in the Daily
Telegraph, Chinese historian Liu Chenshan, writing in an officially
sanctioned newspaper, stated that the threat "came in 1969 at the height
of a bitter border dispute between Moscow and Beijing that left more
than one thousand people dead on both sides." \[1\] [Liu quotes Soviet
premier Alexei Kosygin as stating to Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev on
October 15 that "Washington has drawn up 'detailed plans' for a nuclear
war against the USSR if it attacked China."]{.underline} The Telegraph
writers also speculate that Liu is likely to have had access to official
archives given the appearance of this as part of a series of six
articles in an official news source. The Telegraph article continues:
"[[The historian claims that Washington saw the USSR as a greater threat
than China and wanted a strong China to counter-balance Soviet
power]{.mark}...]{.underline}" They also conclude: "Mr Liu, the author,
admits his version of history is likely to be contested by rival
scholars." However, this Chinese revelation is not "new" to informed
observers. [The Russian desire to settle with China, despite the
cynically named Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual
Assistance that had been signed between Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin in
1950 -- which relegated China to colonial status rather than pave the
way to super-power status\[2\] -- came amidst the culmination of border
disputes that had been ongoing since 1960.\[3]{.underline}\] The largest
conflict had taken place on March 2, 1969, when Chinese troops ambushed
Russian troops on the uninhabited Damansky Island in the Ussuri River,
killing 32 Russians. The Soviets responded on the night of March 14 by
shelling 20 kilometers into China. Approximately 60 Russians and 800
Chinese were killed in the conflict. So extensive was the Russian attack
that Mao feared a Soviet invasion. **[[It was then that the USSR
intended to drive home their offensive with a nuclear
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, in their
book Mao: The Unknown Story, allude to an article at the time published
in a London newspaper "by a KGB-linked Russian journalist Victor Louis",
who had been Russian emissary to Taiwan, stating that the Kremlin was
discussing bombing China's nuclear test site, and planning to set up an
"alterative leadership" for the Chinese Communist party.\[4\] Moreover
it was U.S. President Richard Nixon's aide John Haldeman who seems to
have first broken the nuclear attack story in his memoirs in 1978.\[5\]
He stated that for years the USSR had been trying to warn the USA not to
allow China to become a nuclear power. This claim by Haldeman seems to
directly contradict the claim by Liu that Nixon, when responding to the
1969 Soviet request for neutrality, did so not only because he regarded
China as a means of containing Russia, but also because he was still
"smarting from a Soviet refusal five years earlier to stage a joint
attack on China's nascent nuclear programme."\[6\] If we place this all
into context, I believe that the 1978 Haldeman version is more likely
than that of Liu's present contention. [If the USA had asked for support
from the USSR to bomb China's nuclear programme in 1964, this was a year
following Sino-Russian border conflicts amounting to 4000 dead. In 1960,
there had been 400 clashes; in 1962, 5000.\[]{.underline}7\] The USSR
would have no sentimental, comradely, ideological, diplomatic, or
geo-political reasons to oppose such a US proposal and then change her
mind five years later and make a similar suggestion to the USA. The
relationship between China, the USA, and the USSR is quite contrary to
how it is generally perceived. A more accurate scenario is that the USA
backed Mao and the USSR backed Chiang Kai-shek. Stalin, prior to Mao's
assumption to power, regarded him as a Trotskyite. While Stalin had
previously backed Mao as a counter to a Trotskyite coterie in China
headed by Prof. Chen Tu-hsiu, Mao's onetime mentor, by 1938,\[8\] Mao
was being denounced in the USSR as a Trotskyite.\[9\] During World War
II, while the USA was pushing Chiang to make an alliance with Mao
against the Japanese, Stalin was counselling Chiang against this.\[10\]
Gen. George Marshall warned Chiang in 1946 at a crucial time that if he
persisted in pursuing the beleaguered Red Army into Northern Manchuria,
U.S. aid would stop. This provided Mao with a base from which to
recuperate and finally defeat Chiang. On the other hand, Stalin's aid to
Mao was granted according to Russian interests as distinct from
communist fraternity, one particularly dramatic example of which was the
demand for repayment in food that resulted in 10,000 peasants dying of
starvation in Yenan.\[11\] This was a prelude to the debilitating
Sino-Soviet Treaty that was to result in the "Great Famine" for the same
reason.\[12\] Mao thought that he could make China a great power on
Stalin's coat tails. This was a grave error. While the USA attempted to
court China, Mao went out of his way to act "Bolshie" towards the "Paper
Tiger," in a futile effort to court Stalin. Chang and Halliday write:
"It was widely thought that it was the U.S. that refused to recognize
Mao's China. In fact, Mao went out of his way to make recognition
impossible by engaging in overtly hostile acts."\[13\] In 1979, the year
for the renewal of the 1950 "friendship treaty" between Russia and
China, Mao gestured as to what he by then thought the fraternal
relationship by invading Russia's ally Vietnam, which was particularly
significant in that in 1978 the USSR had entered into a 25 year defence
treaty with Vietnam.\[14\] [Given the historically strained (at best)
relationship between China and Russia, even at a time when they were
supposed to be ideologically aligned, what are likely future scenarios
on the world stage]{.underline}? There seems to be a preponderant view
that the USA and China will increasingly become rivals due to economical
and raw material factors. There is also a view that the USA and Russia
will align against China. Again turning to an article in the Daily
Telegraph, there is an interesting item from 2009. This refers to the
Russian ethnic population decline in the Russian Far East, in comparison
to the burgeoning Chinese population across the border, coupled with the
tremendous mineral resources of the area. David Blair writes: The
endless silver birch forests of the Russian Far East might appear so
desolate and windswept that no one could possibly be interested in them.
Yet the vast swath of territory between Lake Baikal and Vladivostok may
become a new theatre of confrontation between Russia and China in the
decades ahead. For now, the two giant neighbours have been thrust
together by their shared suspicion of America and they cooperate as
tactical allies, working in the United Nations Security Council to
contain Washington's power. But this affinity is based on little more
than having the same rival. [[The empty lands of the Russian Far
East]{.mark}, far closer to Beijing than Moscow, [contain major sources
of tension between the two powers]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### China has an incentive to attack the Russia border

**Sharavin 4** \[Alexander, director of the Political and Military
Analysis Institute, What the Papers Say, Jan 14\]

Question: In your view, who poses the greatest danger to Russia?
Alexander Sharavin: In the Defense Ministry\'s latest report, known as
the White Book, our likely opponents are not named - they remain
anonymous. [However, we believe in being specific. And we name China
first. At present, [China appears to have good neighborly relations with
Russia]{.mark}, and constantly declares that its intentions are
friendly; but some of its actual actions prompt the thought that not
everything is quite that simple]{.underline}. **[For example, [the state
borders issue hasn\'t been fully resolved - and such matters are always
time-bombs.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The Russian media pays a lot of
attention to the territory dispute with Japan over four small islands,
but it totally ignores China\'s pretensions, even though China aspires
to claim much more territory - virtually all of Siberia and the Russian
Far East. Or rather, official Beijing remains silent, but articles do
appear in China\'s newspapers sometimes, and discontented voices are
raised. It\'s hard to believe that anyone could permit themselves to
speak out like that without authorization in totalitarian China. I
repeat: [there is no threat from China in the short term - Beijing\'s
policies are entirely loyal in relation to us at present. But what might
happen ten years from now? What guarantee is there that somebody won\'t
try to play the territory card?]{.underline} Question: And we\'re
selling Beijing modern fighter jets with extra engines. Alexander
Sharavin: Yes, that\'s an alarming point. **[So it seems [China is
allowing for the possibility that the situation might change]{.mark},
and Russia might stop supplying spare parts for military hardware to its
neighbor? And is it any coincidence that [China\'s strongest military
forces are concentrated along our borders, even if they\'re at a
distance of 200 kilometers]{.mark}?]{.underline}** Is that any distance
at all, to them? And let\'s not forget that on our side of the border
there are regions with depressed economies, with vast natural resources
and small, ever-shrinking populations.

#### That causes extinction

**Sharavin 1** \[Alexander, Director of the Institute for Military and
Political Analysis, What the Papers Say, Oct 3\]

Now, a few words about the third type of war**[. [A real military threat
to Russia from China has not merely been ignored; it has been denied by
Russia\'s leaders and nearly all of the political
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Let\'s see some statistic figures at
first. The territory of Siberia and the Russian Far East comprises
12,765,900 square kilometers (75% of Russia\'s entire area), with a
population of 40,553,900 people (28% of Russia\'s population). The
territory of China is 9,597,000 square kilometers and its population is
1.265 billion (which is 29 times greater than the population of Siberia
and the Russian Far East). China\'s economy is among the fastest-growing
economies in the world. It remains socialistic in many aspects, i.e.
extensive and highly expensive, demanding more and more natural
resources. [China\'s natural resources are rather limited]{.underline},
whereas the depths of Siberia and the Russian Far East are almost
inexhaustible. Chinese propaganda has constantly been showing us
skyscrapers in free trade zones in southeastern China. [It should not be
forgotten, however, that some 250 to 300 million people live there, i.e.
at most a quarter of China\'s population.]{.underline} A billion Chinese
people are still living in misery. For them, even the living standards
of a backwater Russian town remain inaccessibly high. **[[They have
absolutely nothing to lose.]{.mark}]{.underline}** There is every
prerequisite for \"the final throw to the north.\" The strength of the
Chinese People\'s Liberation Army (CPLA) has been growing quicker than
the Chinese economy. A decade ago the CPLA was equipped with inferior
copies of Russian arms from late 1950s to the early 1960s. However,
through its own efforts Russia has nearly managed to liquidate its most
significant technological advantage. Thanks to our zeal, from antique
MiG-21 fighters of the earliest modifications and S-75 air defense
missile systems the Chinese antiaircraft defense forces have adopted
Su-27 fighters and S-300 air defense missile systems. China\'s air
defense forces have received Tor systems instead of anti-aircraft guns
which could have been used during World War II. The shock air force of
our \"eastern brethren\" will in the near future replace antique Tu-16
and Il-28 airplanes with Su-30 fighters, which are not yet available to
the Russian Armed Forces! [Russia may face the \"wonderful\" prospect of
combating [the Chinese army]{.mark}, which, if full mobilization is
called, is comparable in size with Russia\'s entire population, **[which
also has nuclear weapons]{.mark}** (even tactical weapons become
strategic if states have common borders) **[and would be absolutely
insensitive to losses]{.mark}** (even a loss of a few million of the
servicemen would be acceptable for China).]{.underline} **[[Such a war
would be more horrible than the World War II.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It
would require from our state maximal tension, universal mobilization and
complete accumulation of the army military hardware, up to the last tank
or a plane, in a single direction (we would have to forget such
\"trifles\" like Talebs and Basaev, but this does not guarantee success
either). [[Massive nuclear strikes on basic military forces and cities
of China would finally be the only way out]{.mark}, what would exhaust
Russia\'s armament completely. We have not got another set of
intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-based missiles,
whereas the general forces would be extremely exhausted in the border
combats]{.underline}. In the long run, even if the aggression would be
stopped after the majority of the Chinese are killed, **[[our country
would be absolutely unprotected against the \"Chechen\" and the
\"Balkan\" variants both, and even against the first frost of a possible
nuclear winter]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
