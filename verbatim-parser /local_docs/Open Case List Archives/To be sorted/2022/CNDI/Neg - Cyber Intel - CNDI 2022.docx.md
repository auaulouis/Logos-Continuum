U.S. and NATO officials on Wednesday also cautioned that it would be a
mistake to think that just because [there have been few signs of
\"catastrophic effects]{.underline}\" that [Russia has]{.underline} not
[tried]{.underline} to leverage its cyber capabilities to its advantage.
[\"It has been happening and it\'s still happening]{.underline},\" said
Stefanie Metka, head of the Cyber Threat Analysis Branch at NATO.
\"There\'s a lot of cyber activity that\'s happening all the time and
probably we won\'t know the full extent of it until we turn the
computers back on.\" Said the NSA\'s Joyce: \"If you look at Ukraine,
they have been heavily targeted. What we\'ve seen are a number of wiper
viruses, seven or eight different or unique wiper viruses that have been
thrown into the ecosystem of Ukraine and its near abroad.\" Wiper
viruses are viruses that erase a computer\'s memory. These included a
cyberattack against a satellite communications company, which hampered
the ability of Ukraine\'s military to communicate and had spillover
effects across Europe. But [with help from the U.S. and other allies,
Ukraine was able to mitigate the impact]{.underline}, Joyce said. \"The
Ukrainians have been under threat and under pressure for a number of
years, and so they have continued to adapt and improve and develop their
tradecraft to the point where they mount a good defense and, equally as
important, they mount a great incident response,\" he said. Some
cybersecurity experts say that ability to respond might be one of the
biggest take-aways, so far, from the invasion. [\"Resiliency
matters]{.underline},\" said Dmitri Alperovitch, the founder of the
Silverado Policy Accelerator and the former chief technology officer of
cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, at Wednesday\'s virtual forum. \"[The
Ukrainians have gotten really, really good at rebuilding networks,
quickly mitigating damage.\"]{.underline} [Another key
lesson]{.underline}, he said, is **[the limitations of
cyber]{.underline}**. \"[If you\'ve got kinetic options, if you can
create a crater somewhere, take out a substation, take out a
communication system, that\'s what you\'re going to prefer to
use]{.underline},\" Alperovitch said. [\"That\'s what\'s easiest \[to
do\] to get lasting damage]{.underline}.\"

Joe [Biden pre-emptively warned Russia]{.underline} that [the US is
"prepared to respond" to]{.underline} any [attacks on critical
infrastructure]{.underline}, and others have warned for years of a
"Cyber Pearl Harbor". [But]{.underline} thus far, experts say, [it has
been relatively quiet on the cyber warfront.]{.underline} "Though it
would be foolhardy to rule it out in the future, [we have
not]{.underline} yet [seen]{.underline} the [completely destructive
attacks]{.underline} on Ukraine infrastructure some anticipated," said
Glenn S Gerstell, former general counsel of the National Security Agency
and Central Security Service. Fears of cyber warfare are stoked by a
long history of international attacks coordinated out of Russia. The
country was behind a large-scale attack on Ukraine's power grid in 2015
in coordination with its annexation of Crimea. In 2017, Moscow unleashed
on to Ukraine the data-wiping NotPetya virus, a destructive malware that
ultimately spread globally. In addition, non-government Russian hackers
have been linked to several brazen hacking schemes in past years,
including the debilitating 2021 ransomware hack of the Colonial pipeline
in the US. [Coinciding with its invasion of Ukraine, Russia unleashed a
number of smaller hacks]{.underline} -- starting in January when more
than 70 Ukrainian websites were defaced and separate cyber-attacks
knocked out government websites including the ministry of foreign
affairs and the education ministry. [While these]{.underline} attacks
[have been "significant and unprecedented]{.underline}", according to
Aaron Turner of California cybersecurity firm Vectra, [they have
"not]{.underline} yet [been catastrophic]{.underline}". [That is largely
because no international power yet wants to be the one to cast the first
stone in a cyber third world war]{.underline}, he said. ["We have most
likely reached a sort of detente, where both sides understand that
catastrophic cyber-attacks will most likely result in mutually assured
destruction of systems,]{.underline}" he added. [National powers are
also now better prepared to stave off attacks than they were
previously]{.underline}, so it is possible some larger hacks have been
quietly thwarted, experts said. [The US has invested billions in cyber
defense resources]{.underline} -- both from private and public sources.
Ukraine spent the past seven years in the wake of its power grid attack
in 2015 steeling its infrastructure. "[There has been a lot of thought
and hard work put into preparing for an all-out assault on the cyber
domain,"]{.underline} said Theresa Payton, cybersecurity expert and
former White House chief information officer. "If we were to experience
a hit to critical infrastructure, there are many playbooks in place to
avoid sustained outages.

### 1nc -- No Escalation

#### No scenario for cyber escalation. 

Erica D. **Borghard 19**, Assistant Professor in the Army Cyber
Institute at the United States Military Academy at West Point, and Shawn
W. Lonergan, Assistant Professor of International Relations in the
Department of Social Science at USMA, "Cyber Operations as Imperfect
Tools of Escalation", Strategic Studies Quarterly, Fall 2019, p. 123-124

However, [there are **important empirical reasons** to suspect that the
[risks of cyber escalation may be **exaggerated**]{.mark}. Specifically,
if cyberspace is in fact an environment that]{.underline} (perhaps even
more so than others) [generates severe escalation risks, [why
has]{.mark} cyber [escalation **not yet occurred**? Most]{.mark}
interactions between cyber rivals [have been]{.mark} characterized by
**[limited volleys]{.mark}** that have **[not]{.mark} escalated**
[beyond **nuisance levels**]{.mark} and have been largely [**contained**
below]{.mark} the [use-of-force]{.mark} threshold]{.underline}.5 For
example, in [a survey]{.underline} of cyber incidents and responses
between 2000 and 2014, Brandon Valeriano et al. [find that
"[rivals]{.mark}]{.underline} tend to [[respond only to
**lower-level**]{.mark} \[cyber\] [incidents an]{.mark}d the response
tends to **[check]{.mark} the [intrusion]{.mark}** as [opposed to seek
**escalation dominance**]{.mark}. The majority of cyber escalation
episodes are at a **low severity threshold** and are **non-escalatory**.
These incidents are usually **['tit-for- tat']{.mark}** type responses
[**within one step** of the]{.mark} original
[incident]{.mark}."]{.underline}6 [[Even in]{.mark} the **two [rare
examples]{.mark}** in which states [employed kinetic
force]{.mark}]{.underline} in response to adversary cyber
operations---the US counter-ISIL drone campaign in 2015 and Israel's
airstrike against Hamas cyber operatives in 2019---[the use of [force
was **circumscribed**]{.mark} and did **not escalate** the overall
conflict]{.underline} (not to mention that force was used against
nonstate adversaries with limited potential to meaningfully escalate in
response to US or Israeli force).7

We posit that [cyber escalation has not occurred because cyber
operations are **poor tools** of escalation]{.underline}. In particular,
we argue that [this stems from **key characteristics** of **offensive**
cyber capabilities that **limit escalation** through four mechanisms.
First, **[retal]{.mark}**iatory offensive cyber
**[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** may not exist at the **desired
time** of employment. Second, even under conditions where they may
exist, their [effects are **uncertain** and]{.mark} often relatively
**[limited]{.mark}**. Third, several attributes of offensive cyber
operations generate **important tradeoffs** for decision-makers that may
make them hesitant to employ capabilities in some
circumstances.]{.underline} [Finally, the alternative of
[**cross-domain** escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}---responding to a
cyber incident with noncyber, kinetic instruments---[[is
**unlikely**]{.mark} to be chosen except under **rare** circumstances,
[given]{.mark} the **[limited]{.mark} cost-generation
[potential]{.mark}** of offensive cyber operations]{.underline}. In this
article, we define cyber escalation and then explore the implications of
the technical features and requirements for offensive cyber operations.
We also consider potential alternative or critical responses to each of
these logics. Finally, we evaluate the implications for US policy
making.

### 1nc -- Private Sector Solves

#### No systemic risk -- big tech is [patching up]{.underline} holes. 

**Chung '21** \[Ingrid; August 30; writer; National Review, "Big Tech Is
Doing the Right Thing on Cybersecurity,"
https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/big-tech-is-doing-the-right-thing-on-cybersecurity/;
KP\]

President Joe Biden recently met with Big Tech executives to discuss how
to improve cybersecurity [[after]{.underline}]{.mark} recent
cyberattacks in which government software contractor
[**[Solarwinds]{.mark}** and]{.underline} oil pipeline **[Colonial
Pipeline]{.underline}** were targeted. Leading [tech corporations,
including [**IBM**, **Google**]{.mark}, and **[Amazon]{.mark}**,
will]{.underline} all try to [**[improve cybersecurity]{.mark}** by
investing in]{.underline} the [training of personnel]{.underline} in
this field [and [upgrading]{.mark}]{.underline} their respective
[**[encryption]{.mark}** and security systems]{.underline}. Microsoft
has also committed to investing \$150 million in upgrades for
cybersecurity systems of government agencies. Big Tech may not always do
the right thing, but [these plans to **enhance
cybersecurity**]{.underline} are certainly something that we can all
stand behind.

In recent years, as the Internet has become increasingly influential and
indispensable, cybersecurity has, correspondingly, become an
increasingly prominent threat to not only citizens' privacy but also to
national security. Former national-security adviser John Bolton
explained the significance of cybersecurity to national defense in a
recent National Review article, in which he characterized threats from
cyberspace as "a multiplicity of hidden, ever-changing threats." A
recent report by the Heritage Foundation raised concern over espionage,
trading of secrets, and the disruption of military commands and
communication potentially being conducted in the cyber domain.

The effective regulation of cyberspace, a relatively new front for
modern warfare characterized by its elusiveness and lack of boundaries,
is sometimes challenging. Laxness in cybersecurity, however, has often
led to catastrophic consequences. For instance, the WannaCry Ransomware
Cyber Attack in 2017, in which files in affected computer systems were
locked until ransom was paid for their decryption, affected
approximately 200,000 computers in 150 countries and led to enormous
financial costs. Victims of the cyber-extortion scheme included entities
from government agencies such as the English National Health Service to
major international corporates such as Boeing.

It is well established that both the state and [leading tech
[corporations have]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**legitimate
[interest]{.mark}** in enhancing **cybersecurity**]{.underline}. The
government is responsible for engaging in national defense in the cyber
domain and tech corporations are obligated to protect the privacy of
their users, whose personal information is often entrusted to them.

[Big [Tech]{.mark}'s [plan]{.mark}s [to **coop**]{.mark}**erate**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[government]{.underline}]{.mark} to
improve cybersecurity through financial investments [appears to be
**promising**]{.underline}. While it may be difficult to predict the
effectiveness of such investments, [the fact that Big Tech]{.underline}
and the government are [placing the enhancement of
[cybersecurity]{.mark}]{.underline} close to the [**[top of]{.mark}
their [agenda]{.mark}** and are committing to **coordinated
[efforts]{.mark}** [is **good news**. Big Tech]{.mark},
with]{.underline} its **[[financial prowess]{.underline}]{.mark}**
derived from the sheer size of the industry, [and]{.underline} a [unique
relationship with]{.underline} the use of [cyberspace[, is **uniquely
positioned** to]{.mark} materially contribute to]{.underline} state-led
efforts to **[[secure cyber]{.mark}space]{.underline}**. Furthermore,
investing in education on cybersecurity of employees may also be useful
in raising awareness and amplifying the industry's collective concern
over capacity to combat cyberattacks in the long run.

### 2nc -- Deterrence Solves

#### Status quo deterrence and norms are effective at preventing attacks

David **Lonsdale 17**, School of Law and Politics, University of Hull,
Cottingham Road, Lonsdale, David J. "Warfighting for Cyber Deterrence: A
Strategic and Moral Imperative." Philosophy & Technology, Feb. 2017.
CrossRef, doi:10.1007/s13347-017-0252-8.

3.4 [The **Failure of Cyber Deterrence?** The potency of cyber
deterrence is difficult to judge]{.underline}. This is partly [because
there exists no consensus on what constitutes an act of
sufficient]{.underline} cyber [aggression]{.underline}. Therefore, it is
not entirely clear what is to be deterred. Where exactly the threshold
for response should be will be discussed in section three of this paper.
[For now]{.underline}, we can state that **[low-level [nuisance
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[are]{.mark} a **[daily]{.mark}
occurrence**]{.underline}. For example, U.S. military networks are
probed and scanned millions of times each day (Work 2015, 1). Similarly,
[acts of cyber espionage are reasonably common]{.underline}.
[[However]{.mark}, what is also [evident is the **lack of
major**]{.mark} **cyber [attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [For a while,
Stuxnet, Wiper, Shamoon and Bronze Soldier appeared to signal the rise
of cyber attack as a potent new instrument of policy. However, **medium
to [large]{.mark}-scale [attacks]{.mark} have essentially
[dried-up]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Indeed, reflecting the empirical
evidence, and marking a shift in tone, in his]{.underline} September
[2015 testimony]{.underline} to the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Director of National Intelligence, James [[Clapper]{.underline},
**[talked down]{.underline}**]{.mark} the possibility of **[[an
'electronic Pearl Harbor']{.underline}]{.mark}**. Instead, he focused on
ongoing 'low-to-moderate' level threats (Clapper 2015, 2). What does
this all tell us? **[Is deterrence working?]{.underline}** If one
considers low-to-moderate threats as deterrable, then the answer would
seem to be no. From this perspective, and according to some policy
makers, deterrence is already failing. In a 2015 Senate Armed Services
Committee Hearing, Chairman John McCain was scathing in his assessment:
'Our adversaries view our response \... as timid and ineffectual. Put
simply, the problem is a lack of deterrence. The administration has not
demonstrated to our adversaries that the consequence of continued cyber
attacks against us outweigh the benefit.' (Takala 2015) However, [if we
take the view that cyber [deterrence should]{.mark}]{.underline} really
[[concern itself only with **large**]{.mark}**-scale
[attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the picture is]{.underline} more
**[positive]{.underline}**. Indeed, [Valeriano and
[Maness]{.mark}]{.underline} (2015) have
[[identified]{.underline}]{.mark} **[considerable]{.underline}** levels
of [**[restraint]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [state [cyber
behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}. This could be [[due to]{.mark} a **[lack
of confidence in the]{.mark} strategic [utility of]{.mark} cyber
[attack]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[It may also reflect]{.mark} the
development of **[norms]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against
aggressive]{.underline} forms of [cyber behaviour [and]{.mark} the
efficacy of **[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed,
[norms]{.underline} increasingly [form part of '**complex deterrence'**,
within which military and non-military elements operate
together]{.underline}. In cyberspace, although a settled understanding
of universal rules of behaviour is still lacking, [[norms]{.mark} appear
to be [crystalis]{.mark}ing [around **acceptable**]{.mark}]{.underline}
forms of [**[intrusion]{.underline}** [rather than]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a **blanket [non-use]{.mark} position**]{.underline} (Stevens 2012,
25). [[This]{.mark} may [explain]{.mark} the continuance of [lowlevel
probes]{.mark} whilst large attacks have trailed off.]{.underline}

#### No [large-scale cyberattacks]{.underline}\-\--attribution deters AND complexity overwhelms [despite]{.underline} technical advancements.

Miguel Alberto N. **Gomez, 11-6**-2018 - senior researcher at the Center
for Security Studies at ETH Zurich; \"In Cyberwar, There Are Some
(Unspoken) Rules,\" Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/11/06/in-cyberwar-there-are-some-unspoken-rules-international-law-norms-north-korea-russia-iran-stuxnet/

Unlike conventional instruments, cyberoperations do not come with a
return address. Technical evidence such as an IP address provides
victims with a possible source but not necessarily the identity of the
attacker. Furthermore, the presence of certain artifacts does not
confirm the intent of the aggressor. Malicious code for use in espionage
can just as well be employed as a first step for later, more damaging
operations. Taken together, these factors would seem to encourage
instability within cyberspace, as Wheeler argues. However, when viewed
through the lens of preexisting strategic interactions and interests,
[the opposite may]{.underline} in fact [be true]{.underline}.

**[[Attribution becomes less of an obstacle]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[when]{.mark} judgments are [informed by tactical and strategic
analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, the appearance of
[individuals]{.underline} in [unmarked uniforms]{.underline} carrying
[modern]{.underline} Russian [weaponry in Ukraine]{.underline} were
[attributable to Russia]{.underline}, **[given]{.underline}** the
**[characteristics]{.underline}** of these individuals [as well as the
surrounding context that preceded their appearance.]{.underline}

[Different [actors behave in a **distinct manner**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[that allows analysts]{.underline}---private threat assessment
organizations and national intelligence services alike---[to identify
and classify individuals and groups]{.underline}. When analyzed
alongside the prevailing political, economic, and military environment,
[both the [identity]{.mark} and intent of the supposedly nonattributable
actor **usually [become clearer]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The intent of
those deploying Stuxnet limited the pool of suspects to those with both
the intent and the capabilities to execute this operation. [Without the
benefit of anonymity]{.underline}, [[aggressors are **less
inclined**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} engage in activities that significantly
[alter the current military balance for **fear of provoking the opposite
party**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

For example, the long-running series of defacements and
denial-of-service operations between India and Pakistan reflects this
dynamic. Given the stable nature of this rivalry, both sides have opted
for a tit-for-tat approach with respect to disruptive behavior. The
defacement of an Indian website is met with the defacement of a
corresponding Pakistani website in a matter of days with neither side
opting for a more vigorous response to the provocations of the other.

The aftermath of Stuxnet prompted Iran to act more aggressively in
cyberspace in the years following its discovery, but Tehran's operations
did not do much damage. Furthermore, [with states reserving the right to
respond with conventional military means to cyberthreats, the
**[necessity for restraint becomes]{.mark} even
[great]{.mark}er**]{.underline}.

Because [[decision-makers]{.mark} **[know the
risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[cybercapable states
routinely]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[punch below their
weight]{.underline}]{.mark}** [or]{.underline} decide to
[employ]{.underline} [cyberoperations in a limited]{.underline}
[manner]{.underline}. A review of cyberoperations from 2006 to 2016
highlights that **[[despite]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[advancements]{.underline}]{.mark}** of numerous actors,
[[operations]{.underline}]{.mark} capable [of causing physical damage
[are **limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}. More recently, the announcement
that the United States would deter Russia from interfering in its
midterm elections by calling it out rather than using more aggressive
means underlines this point.

[This applies to the targeting of critical infrastructure]{.underline},
such as [power grids]{.underline} and [water treatment
facilities]{.underline}, managed by industrial control systems that are
demonstrated to be vulnerable to relatively simple exploits. [When a
state decides to target industrial controls]{.underline}, [it does so
with a specific intent]{.underline} that is informed by its strategic
objectives. [These objectives are discernible through its actions in
other domains]{.underline}. [[These constraints]{.mark} **[even apply
to]{.mark}**]{.underline} perceived rogue states such as **[[North
Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

A review of North Korean cyberoperations from 2008 to 2014 illustrates
that most of Pyongyang's attacks caused low-level disruptions to private
and nonmilitary systems of adversaries, which include the United States,
Japan, and South Korea. In addition, these often coincided with
significant historical, political, or military events. The same is true
in the case of Iran. The nature and timing of these incidents is
telling, as a similar pattern is observed with respect to the physical
domain. North Korean behavior, barring its invasion of South Korea in
1950, has not been severe enough to invite a massive response.
Provocations such as missile tests or the shelling of a South
Korean-held island have invited international condemnation or a limited
military response---but no more and with limited impact on North Korean
behavior.

Although the 2014 Sony Pictures hack, which leaked confidential
information and later involved physical threats against cinemas that
screened The Interview, may appear to be a departure from this behavior,
the operation did not disrupt the current strategic balance between
North Korea and its adversary, in this case the United States. Nor did
the U.S. government seem to think the hack merited a more vigorous
response other than the recent complaint filed by the U.S. Justice
Department. For the most part, the intent of the Sony hack appears to
have been meant to signal the North Korean regime's displeasure through
a display of its prowess in cyberspace but no more. [Even with the more
recent WannaCry ransomware attack, its effects, while broad in scope,
had no lasting strategic implications that might have resulted in
escalation.]{.underline}

Countries that have invested significant resources in cyberspace don't
lack the ability to act more effectively within this domain. [[They are
making]{.mark} a **[conscious decision]{.mark}** [to rely on]{.mark}
[less sophisticated operations based on]{.mark} their **[strategic
calculus]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[the same calculus that leads a
government such as North Korea's to employ violent rhetoric and limited
military operations]{.underline} to signal its displeasure
**[without]{.underline}** [risking direct confrontation]{.underline}.

[If critical industrial control systems are so easily compromised, one
would expect governments to target these vulnerable systems more
frequently]{.underline} rather than resort to mere disruption. [While
reports do suggest that North Korea has the capability to disrupt
critical infrastructure]{.underline} such as power grids, acting on this
is another matter altogether---much in the same way that having
significant conventional military power does not merit its immediate
use. **[[There would be grave consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Cybercriminals and script kiddies may see in these vulnerable systems an
opportunity for profit or mischief. But [[attributional analysi]{.mark}s
that looks beyond technological features and includes tactical and
strategic attributes **[can]{.mark} help [distinguish]{.mark}** [between
state-associated and independent criminal actors]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There is a vast body of experience in dealing with cases of cybercrime.
While the corresponding institutions and legislation are far from
perfect, they do offer a course of action if actors are classified under
this category. Subjecting state-associated actors to this form of
punishment, however, may not be as effective in deterring malicious
behavior in this domain. Previous indictments against Chinese hackers
appear to have had limited effect in deterring economic espionage. It is
too early to tell if recent legal actions against North Korea, Russia,
and China will have any noticeable effects in cyberspace.

Wheeler correctly presents cyberspace as a vulnerable domain that
continues to lack a set of norms that regulates aggressive tendencies.
But [that doesn't mean that [state actors]{.mark} will immediately take
the opportunity to fully exploit this situation to further their
interests]{.underline}. [They [are]{.mark} **[acutely aware]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} the [consequences of]{.mark} overly [aggressive]{.mark}
[cyberoperations and]{.mark}]{.underline} [t]{.mark}herefore
**[[actively]{.mark} attempt to [limit]{.mark}]{.underline}** the impact
of their [activities]{.underline} [by]{.underline} either **[narrowing
the scope]{.underline}** of their operations [or resorting [to
techniques that do **minimal damage**]{.mark} [and
are]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[easily contained]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

[[Adequate **health care**]{.mark}, [housing]{.mark},
[education]{.mark}, and clean water and air [are]{.mark} increasingly
[out of reach for]{.mark} large sections of [the
population]{.mark}]{.underline}, [even in wealthy countries]{.underline}
in North America and Europe, while transportation is becoming more
difficult in the United States and many other countries due to
irrationally high levels of dependency on the automobile and
disinvestment in public transportation. Urban structures are more and
more characterized by gentrification and segregation, with cities
becoming the playthings of the well-to-do while marginalized populations
are shunted aside. About half a million people, most of them children,
are homeless on any given night in the United States.14 New York City is
experiencing a major rat infestation, attributed to warming
temperatures, mirroring trends around the world.15

[In the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and other high-income
countries]{.underline}, [[life expectancy is in
decline]{.underline}]{.mark}, with a remarkable resurgence of Victorian
illnesses related to poverty and exploitation. In Britain, gout, scarlet
fever, whooping cough, and even scurvy are now resurgent, along with
tuberculosis. With inadequate enforcement of work health and safety
regulations, black lung disease has returned with a vengeance in U.S.
coal country.16 [[Overuse of antibiotics]{.underline}]{.mark},
particularly by capitalist agribusiness, [is [lead]{.mark}ing
[to]{.mark} an]{.underline}
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**nti**[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**iotic-**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**esistance
**[crisis]{.underline}**, [[with]{.mark} the [dangerous]{.mark} growth
of **[superbugs]{.mark}**]{.underline} generating increasing numbers of
deaths, which by mid--century could surpass annual cancer deaths,
[prompting the World Health Organization to declare a "global health
emergency."]{.underline}17 These dire conditions, arising from the
workings of the system, are consistent with what Frederick Engels, in
the Condition of the Working Class in England, called "social murder."18

At the instigation of giant corporations, philanthrocapitalist
foundations, and neoliberal governments, public education has been
restructured around corporate-designed testing based on the
implementation of robotic common-core standards. This is generating
massive databases on the student population, much of which are now being
surreptitiously marketed and sold.19 The corporatization and
privatization of education is feeding the progressive subordination of
children's needs to the cash nexus of the commodity market. We are thus
seeing a dramatic return of Thomas Gradgrind's and Mr. M'Choakumchild's
crass utilitarian philosophy dramatized in Charles Dickens's Hard Times:
"Facts are alone wanted in life" and "You are never to fancy."20 Having
been reduced to intellectual dungeons, many of the poorest, [most
[racially segregated schools]{.mark} in the United States [are]{.mark}
mere **[pipelines for prisons]{.mark}** or the military]{.underline}.21

[More than two million people in the United States are behind
bars]{.underline}, a higher rate of incarceration than any other country
in the world, [constituting a new Jim Crow]{.underline}. The total
population in prison is nearly equal to the number of people in Houston,
Texas, the fourth largest U.S. city. African Americans and Latinos make
up 56 percent of those incarcerated, while constituting only about 32
percent of the U.S. population. Nearly 50 percent of American adults,
and a much higher percentage among African Americans and Native
Americans, have an immediate family member who has spent or is currently
spending time behind bars. Both black men and Native American men in the
United States are nearly three times, Hispanic men nearly two times,
more likely to die of police shootings than white men.22 [[Racial
divides]{.mark} [are]{.mark} now [widening]{.mark} across the entire
planet]{.underline}.

[[Violence against women]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [expropriation]{.mark}
of their unpaid labor]{.underline}, as well as the higher level of
exploitation of their paid labor, [[are integral]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
way in which power is organized [in capitalist]{.mark}
[society]{.mark}]{.underline}---and how it seeks to divide rather than
unify the population. More than a third of women worldwide have
experienced physical/sexual violence. Women's bodies, in particular, are
objectified, reified, and commodified as part of the normal workings of
monopoly-capitalist marketing.23

[The [mass media-propaganda]{.mark} system]{.underline}, part of the

interactions, vested interests are able to tailor their messages,
largely unchecked, to individuals and their social networks, creating
concerns about "fake news" on all sides.24 Numerous business entities
promising technological manipulation of voters in countries across the
world have now surfaced, auctioning off their services to the highest
bidders.25 The elimination of net neutrality in the United States means
further concentration, centralization, and control over the entire

space force as a separate branch of the military in an attempt to ensure
U.S. dominance in the militarization of space. Sounding the alarm on the
increasing dangers of a nuclear war and of climate destabilization, the
distinguished Bulletin of Atomic Scientists moved its doomsday clock in
2018 to two minutes to midnight, the closest since 1953, when it marked
the advent of thermonuclear weapons.29

Increasingly severe economic sanctions are being imposed by the United
States on countries like Venezuela and Nicaragua, despite their
democratic elections---or because of them. [Trade and currency wars are
being actively promoted by core states, while racist barriers against
immigration continue to be erected in]{.underline} Europe and [the
United States]{.underline} as some 60 million refugees and internally
displaced peoples flee devastated environments. Migrant populations
worldwide have risen to 250 million, with those residing in high-income
countries constituting more than 14 percent of the populations of those
countries, up from less than 10 percent in 2000. Meanwhile, ruling
circles and wealthy countries seek to wall off islands of power and
privilege from the mass of humanity, who are to be left to their fate.30

[More than [three-quarters of a billion people]{.mark}]{.underline},
over 10 percent of the world population, [[are]{.mark} chronically
[malnourished]{.mark}]{.underline}.31 Food stress in the United States
keeps climbing, leading to the rapid growth of cheap dollar stores
selling poor quality and toxic food. Around forty million Americans,
representing one out of eight households, including nearly thirteen
million children, are food insecure.32 Subsistence farmers are being
pushed off their lands by agribusiness, private capital, and sovereign
wealth funds in a global depeasantization process that constitutes the
greatest movement of people in history.33 Urban overcrowding and poverty
across much of the globe is so severe that one can now reasonably refer
to a "planet of slums."34 Meanwhile, the world housing market is
estimated to be worth up to \$163 trillion (as compared to the value of
gold mined over all recorded history, estimated at \$7.5 trillion).35

[[The Anthropocene epoch]{.underline}]{.mark}, first ushered in by the

is now estimated that 60 percent of the world's wildlife vertebrate
population (including mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and fish)
have been wiped out since 1970, while the worldwide abundance of
invertebrates has declined by 45 percent in recent decades.37 What
climatologist James Hansen calls the ["species exterminations" resulting
from accelerating climate change and rapidly shifting climate zones are
only compounding this general process of biodiversity loss]{.underline}.
Biologists expect that half of all species will be facing extinction by
the end of the century.38

[If present climate-change trends continue, [the]{.mark} "[global carbon

[Nevertheless, major energy corporations continue to lie about climate

admitting the truth in their internal documents. These corporations are
working to accelerate the extraction and production of fossil fuels,
including the dirtiest, most greenhouse gas-generating varieties,
reaping enormous profits in the process. The melting of the Arctic ice
from global warming is seen by capital as a new El Dorado, opening up
massive additional oil and gas reserves to be exploited without regard
to the consequences for the earth's climate. In response to scientific
reports on climate change, Exxon Mobil declared that it intends to
extract and sell all of the fossil-fuel reserves at its disposal.41
Energy corporations continue to intervene in climate negotiations to
ensure that any agreements to limit carbon emissions are defanged.

Perhaps [the simplest form of cross domain response to cyber threats is
to **forgo the use of the cyber domain altogether**]{.underline}. [While
it is hard if not impossible to limit exposure to nuclear
weapons]{.underline} and even a determined conventional assault, **[the
risk of cyber attack can be completely eliminated by disconnection from
digital networks]{.underline}**. [The internet is an artificial
environment and connection to it is voluntary.]{.underline} Individuals,
organizations, and states retain the ability to unplug completely, limit
their online transactions, or erect various barriers to connection.
[Obviously disconnection is not very feasible]{.underline} commercially,
socially, and militarily today, [but this is more of an indicator of
**how positive the benefits of interconnection are**]{.underline}
compared to the perceived risks. [If the **risks were perceived as
extreme**]{.underline}, then firms and [states could **go
back**]{.underline} to making a living as they did before 1991 (when WWW
went public). [This is a **cross-domain threat**]{.underline} [because
it entails **exiting the cyber domain**]{.underline} altogether [to
leverage]{.underline} more traditional economic and **[military
transactions]{.underline}**. The threat of disconnection follows from
the more general logic of international organizations, where contracts
must be self-enforcing.44 [On the internet as in institutions, ties
among egoistic actors under anarchy must be mutually beneficial. **If
the internet is a bad deal for actors, they can throw up boundaries or
exit**]{.underline} cyberspace altogether. [If repeated exposure to
adversarial exploitation causes states to lose more than they gain from
being online, then they can **undermine the attacker's very means for
accessing the victim**]{.underline}. The threat of voluntary
disconnection is especially relevant for repeated interactions, or
repeated exploitation, rather than a one-shot "bolt from the blue" cyber
attack (which is better countered with cross-domain retaliation). The
threat of disconnection is implicit in the voluntary nature of
connection to the internet, and [the potential loss of the ability to
make future attacks **exercises a deterrent effect on attacks in the
present**]{.underline}. [An aggressor who does not want to lose the
cyber]{.underline} adjuncts for [espionage and disruption it has
invested so much in developing will **show restraint**]{.underline} in
their employment. This does not mean that [coercion]{.underline} cannot
take place online, but it [is]{.underline} **[bounded by excess
value]{.underline}**. One implication is that the countries that can be
most coerced on the internet will be those that have the most to lose by
leaving it.

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration has
escalated warnings about likely Russian cyber-attacks on American
infrastructure and business. More worrying still, [cyber
alarmists]{.underline} like Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark
Warner, D-Va., have [suggested that cyber-attacks from the Kremlin could
be acts of war]{.underline} that trigger NATO's collective defense.

**[This sky-is-falling delusion]{.underline}**, particularly from
leaders with access to classified intelligence, [is at best
counterproductive and at worst dangerous]{.underline}.

[Cyber-attacks are rarely acts of war]{.underline}, and treating them as
if they are undermines NATO's ability to deal with real threats short of
cyber war.

NATO has only invoked Article 5 -- which triggers a collective response
-- once and that was after the 9/11 attacks.

[Cyber-attacks are unlikely to destroy buildings and kill thousands in
an instant]{.underline}. While collective defense extends to cyberspace,
[few operations could realistically be a cause for war.]{.underline}

[This would include cyber-attacks resulting in death]{.underline} or
damage like traditional military operations [or coordinated assaults
that take the power grid or entire economic sectors
offline]{.underline}. **[These scenarios are unlikely]{.underline}**
though: such [attacks require far too much time, funding, manpower, and
control]{.underline}. Instead, most attacks temporarily overwhelm
servers with traffic, deny network access, hold computers hostage, and
steal or delete data.

[Even if allies wanted to trigger Article 5]{.underline} over cyber
operations, [**disagreements** about the definitions of threats, origins
of attacks, and pain thresholds in cyberspace can **derail the
process**.]{.underline}

Collective retaliation requires a unanimous vote across NATO; building
unity across these points is nearly impossible for most cyber activity.
Unlike missile attacks or tanks in the streets[, few "red lines" exist
to distinguish cybercrime, cyber espionage, and cyber disruption from
digital acts of war]{.underline}.

concentrating on cyber security. The Concept of Deterrence and its
Applicability in the Cyber Domain, The Quarterly Journal,
https://connections-qj.org/article/concept-deterrence-and-its-applicability-cyber-domain

Cyberspace as the fifth domain is omnipresent, and all developed states
increasingly realize that international relations and typical domains of
statehood change in the face of global digitization. [With the advent of
game-changing technologies]{.underline}, traditional [statecraft tools,
such as deterrence, seem disregarded as outdated in the national
security strategy building process]{.underline}. [Advanced
states]{.underline}, in particular, [depend heavily on an open and safe
cyber domain but, at the same time, suffer from manifold
vulnerabilities. The recent past showed that sophisticated cyberattacks
have the potential to disrupt governments, economies, and societies
significantly and therefore pose a threat to core security interests. As
a classical tool in international relations, deterrence can help bolster
national security interests, even if the cyber domain requires some
special considerations]{.underline}. Therefore, the article explains the
basic mechanisms of deterrence in the nuclear age and contemporary
international relations, cyberspace's legal framework, and possible ways
to apply deterrence in the cyber domain. It aims to urge global leaders
to thoroughly [consider deterrence in the cyber domain as a powerful
asset and to provide policymakers with options for action]{.underline}.
Speaking about deterrence in the 21st century feels like excavating
remnants of a bygone era. [With the advent of nuclear technologies and
mainly during the Cold war, deterrence was a topic not only for
politicians and academia but also shaped the daily lives of millions, no
matter which side of the 'blocks' they belonged to.]{.underline} Since
then, deterrence diminished its presence in the public perception
together with the nuclear arsenals of the great powers. What remains is
still of enormous potential but as a tool of statecraft rather than a
placeholder. Especially states face the gradual change of the
traditionally state-centered setting of the international system,
particularly in habitual domains of statehood, like security. [The
classical understanding of war and conflict blurs and the traditional
state structures seem to be overstrained to respond with the classical
tools, as the new type of conflict is multilayered (political, military,
and economic, among others), conducted mostly by non-military means like
propaganda and political agitation and amongst diverse state and
non-state
actors.]{.underline}[\[1\]](https://connections-qj.org/article/concept-deterrence-and-its-applicability-cyber-domain#_ftn1),[\[2\]](https://connections-qj.org/article/concept-deterrence-and-its-applicability-cyber-domain#_ftn2)
In the face of daily and continuing attacks on governments and their
organs,[\[3\]](https://connections-qj.org/article/concept-deterrence-and-its-applicability-cyber-domain#_ftn3)
the question persists: What keeps an actor in the cyber domain from
carrying out the same attacks over and over again, or even climbing up
the escalation ladder and causing irreversible harm, if it serves his
interests. There seems to be no respect, no fear of retaliation, and no
serious technical barriers in the cyber domain -- or in other words, no
deterrence. This article will survey if the concept of deterrence is
only effective if it is tied to nuclear weaponry and if it becomes
useless in a no longer (purely) nuclear but cyber-dominated
international system. The author claims that this is not the case! [Even
in the cyber age, deterrence can be a powerful tool of statecraft and
could contribute to the protection of state's national security
interests]{.underline}. To prove this hypothesis, this article will
scrutinize the concept of deterrence by looking into the past that
generated manifold experiences on that topic, to finally project the
findings into present times. Therefore, existing concepts of deterrence
and special implications of the cyber arena, together with the legal
framework of the ever more digitized international system, will be
examined to finally find effective ways to apply deterrence in cyber
space. The following assumptions and exclusions are considered common
ground:

Coming Cyberpeace: The Normative Argument Against Cyberwarfare, Foreign
Affairs,
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2015-05-13/coming-cyberpeace>)

The era of cyberconflict is upon us; at least, experts seem to accept
that cyberattacks are the new normal. In fact, however, [evidence
suggests that cyberconflict is not as prevalent as many
believe]{.underline}. Likewise, [the severity of individual cyber events
is not]{.underline} increasing, even if the frequency of overall attacks
has risen. And an [emerging norm against the use of severe state-based
cybertactics contradicts fear-mongering news reports]{.underline} about
a coming cyberapocalypse. [The few isolated incidents of successful
state-based cyberattacks do not a trend make]{.underline}. Rather, what
we are seeing is cyberespionage and probes, not cyberwarfare. Meanwhile,
the international consensus has stabilized around a number of limited
acceptable uses of cybertechnology---one that prohibits any dangerous
use of force. [Despite fears of a boom in cyberwarfare, there have been
no major or dangerous hacks between countries]{.underline}. The closest
any states have come to such events occurred when Russia attacked
Georgian news outlets and websites in 2008; when Russian forces shut
down banking, government, and news websites in Estonia in 2007; when
Iran attacked the Saudi Arabian oil firm Saudi Aramco with the Shamoon
virus in 2012; and when the United States attempted to sabotage Iran's
nuclear power systems from 2007 to 2011 through the Stuxnet worm. The
attack on Sony from North Korea is just the latest overhyped cyberattack
to date, as the corporate giant has recovered its lost revenues from the
attack and its networks are arguably more resilient as a result. Even
these are more probes into vulnerabilities than full attacks. [Russia's
aggressions show that Moscow is willing to use cyberwarfare for
disruption and propaganda, but not to inflict injuries or lasting
infrastructural damage.]{.underline} The Shamoon incident allowed
[Iran]{.underline} to punish Saudi Arabia for its alliance with the
United States as Tehran faced increased sanctions; the attack destroyed
files on Saudi Aramco's computer network but [failed to do any lasting
damage. The Stuxnet incident also failed to create any lasting
damage]{.underline}, as Tehran put more centrifuges online to compensate
for virus-based losses and strengthened holes in their system. Further,
[these supposedly successful cases of cyberattacks are balanced by many
more examples of unsuccessful ones]{.underline}. If the future of
cyberconflict looks like today, the international community must
[reassess the severity of the threat.]{.underline} [Cyberattacks have
demonstrated themselves to be more smoke than fire]{.underline}. This is
not to suggest that incidents are on the decline, however. Distributed
denial-of-service attacks and infiltrations increase by the
minute---every major organization is probed constantly, but only for
weaknesses or new infiltration methods for potential use in the future.
[Probes and pokes do not destabilize states or change trends within
international politics. Even common cyber actions have little effect on
levels of cooperation and conflict between states.]{.underline}

https://warontherocks.com/2017/09/the-myth-of-russias-lowered-nuclear-threshold/\]//BPS

Yet [the [ev]{.mark}idence [for a lowered]{.mark} Russian nuclear
[threshold is]{.mark}]{.underline} getting **[[weaker by the
day]{.underline}]{.mark}**. First, [there is]{.underline} very
[little]{.underline} hard [evidence]{.underline} that de-escalation is
part of Russia's nuclear doctrine. In fact, [**Russia's doctrinal
statements** indicate **an increased rather than a decreased** nuclear
threshold]{.underline}. Second, the idea of [lowering]{.underline} the
nuclear [[threshold]{.mark} logically [flows from]{.mark} a [lack of
conventional capabilities, while]{.mark}]{.underline} in fact
[[Russia's]{.mark} conventional capabilities are **[rapidly
improving]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Third, [it is [difficult to understand
why Russia would]{.mark}]{.underline} want to pursue military
adventurism that would [[risk]{.mark} **all-out [confrontation]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark} a technologically advanced and nuclear-armed]{.underline}
adversary like [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}. While opportunistic, and
possibly even reckless, the [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} regime [[does
not appear]{.underline}]{.mark} to be [[suicidal]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Make no mistake: Nuclear weapons remain essential to Russian national
security, and the deterrent utility of the largest nuclear arsenal in
the world remains significant. Nuclear weapons remain the single most
important deterrent asset Russia has. Still, [[Russia]{.mark} today [is
**less**]{.mark}**, not more [likely]{.mark}** [to use nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline} than it was 10 or 15 years ago.
[Advances]{.underline} in conventional and non-military capabilities
have [made Russia less reliant on using nuclear weapons]{.underline} to
deal with security threats. Russia has a broader range of tools to
signal her resolve to a potential adversary than she did a decade ago.
[[Official]{.mark}ly declared Russian [doctrine]{.mark} over the past
seven years [confirms]{.mark} this [increased]{.mark} range of
[options]{.mark}]{.underline}. This was not always the case. Seventeen
years ago, Russian leaders were indeed contemplating a lower nuclear
threshold. NATO's intervention in Kosovo made it clear that Russia's
conventional capabilities seriously lagged behind the West's, leaving a
deep and lasting impression on the Russian political and military
leadership. Nuclear weapons came to be seen as Russia's only trump card
in the face of massive Western conventional (particularly air)
superiority. This viewpoint produced a seminal article by Russian
military theorists V. I. Levshin, A. V. Nedelin and M. E. Sosnovsky, "On
the use of nuclear weapons to de-escalate military conflict". The
article explained how the limited use of nuclear weapons early in a
conflict could convince an adversary of the risks associated with
continuing aggression, thereby de-escalating the situation. There were
several indications of a lowered nuclear threshold in this period, from
the purported de-escalation strike with nuclear weapons in the 1999
Zapad exercise to the open-ended wording of the 2000 Russian military
doctrine, which said nuclear weapons could be used "in situations that
are critical to the national security of the Russian Federation." Still,
even at the height of perceived Russian conventional backwardness, the
theory of nuclear de-escalation was never doctrinally codified or
officially endorsed. Russia watchers were actively contemplating this
reduced nuclear threshold at the time, but in a benign security
environment, Western policymakers paid little attention to this strategy
shift. Over the next two decades, Russia's prescriptive solutions to
strategic challenges would change. Analysts still pondering the lowered
Russian nuclear threshold pay too little attention to this shift, focus
in part on outdated elements of Russian strategy. Since the early 2000s,
[Russia's [declaratory]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear [[strategy]{.mark}
has]{.underline} actually [[become **more
restrictive**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The current Russian military
doctrine, issued in 2014, states that nuclear weapons can be used "when
the very existence of the state is under threat," compared to the more
expansive conditions laid out in 2000. Nonetheless, many nuclear hawks
claim that a classified document outlining nuclear deterrence strategy,
which Russia retains in addition to the openly declared military
doctrine, must spell out the nuclear de-escalation theory. This may be
so: We have yet to see any leaked or other information on this. An
alternate interpretation of the lack of official confirmation of the
de-escalation theory is that this is not, in fact, a dominant aspect of
Russian warfighting strategy. [It would be [**nonsensical**
for]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[secret and public doc]{.mark}ument[s
to]{.mark} **blatantly [contradict]{.mark}**]{.underline} one another.
The nuclear de-escalation concept was also controversial inside Russia.
A number of theorists questioned whether using or threatening to use
nuclear weapons early on would produce the desired effect, i.e. a
cessation of hostilities rather than compelling the adversary to
escalate in kind. Both Russian officials and analysts emphasized that
the 2000 doctrine, with its increased reliance on nuclear weapons, was
intended for a transitional phase, until conventional forces and other
capabilities could contribute to more effective and more credible
deterrence consisting of a broader range of military and non-military
options. Many observers wanted a less risky and less nuclear-focused
deterrence strategy as soon as this would be viable. By the late 2000s,
discussions of "Russian strategic deterrence" had overtaken
deliberations about nuclear de-escalation, and by 2010, this concept was
part of the official military doctrine. The Russian strategic deterrence
concept depicted the seamless integration of nuclear, conventional, and
non-military capabilities to influence the adversary in times of peace,
conflict, and war. The backbone of strategic deterrence was, of course,
nuclear weapons. But crucially, it also entailed a range of assets,
precisely in order to avoid an unhealthy dependence on nuclear weapons
to compensate for conventional inferiority. Non-nuclear deterrence
involves both military and non-military assets that can convince an
adversary that the costs of aggression against Russia would outweigh any
benefit. These include precision strike capabilities, effective command,
control, intelligence, and reconnaissance capabilities, effective
strategic assets such as aerospace defense forces and special operations
forces, information warfare capabilities, and non-military tools such as
diplomatic, economic, and political instruments of influence. These
non-nuclear tools would add to the combined credibility of Russian
deterrence, particularly in deterring regional conflicts and emerging
threats, such as color revolutions. Nuclear weapons were still central
under the strategic deterrence concept, but rather than taking on an
elevated role to compensate for a lack of conventional options, they
shifted toward a more normalized role in deterring large-scale
aggression. By 2014, official Russian strategy documents reflected this
development; the main novelty in the 2014 military doctrine was its
introduction of non-nuclear deterrence: "A complex of foreign policy,
military and military-technical measures aimed at preventing aggression
against the Russian Federation through non-nuclear means." [[At the
height of]{.underline}]{.mark} Western
post-[[Crimea]{.underline}]{.mark} stress syndrome [and nuclear
paranoia]{.underline}, the timing of this publication is interesting. If
ever there was a perfect time to cement the Western perception of a
Russian "madman" nuclear strategy, this would be it. [The
[Russia]{.mark}ns]{.underline} missed it, [[opt]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
instead [[for]{.mark} a concept that **[increased]{.mark}, rather than
decreased**, the [requirements]{.mark} for nuclear use]{.underline}. The
[more conspiracy-prone]{.underline} may [claim this is a classic Russian
diversionary tactic]{.underline}. The problem is that deterrence only
works if your adversary actually understands what your intentions and
capabilities are. [[Declared and non-declared]{.mark} nuclear
[doctrines]{.mark} that point in opposite directions]{.underline} not
only [**[seem absurd]{.mark}**; they]{.underline} also [confuse your
adversary and make deterrence less effective]{.underline}. This is all
the more reason to pay attention to the clear message in Russian
official doctrine, now reflecting a deterrence concept that had been
developing among Russian theorists for a decade. [Russia has been
piling]{.underline} significant effort and [[resources
in]{.mark}to]{.underline} developing cutting-edge [[conventional]{.mark}
capabilities]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} further
[[undermines]{.mark} the]{.underline} idea of a [[lowered
threshold]{.underline}]{.mark}. Seeing the holistic Russian approach to
strategic deterrence is essential for understanding the role of nuclear
weapons in that strategy. The comprehensive modernization of Russia's
conventional armed forces and the development of a broad set of
non-traditional tools of statecraft have enabled Russia to rely less on
nuclear weapons to influence adversaries. To predict when and how Russia
may use nuclear weapons, that is, Russia's nuclear threshold, we need to
understand how and when Russia may use these other tools to achieve
similar goals. The [list of capabilities]{.underline} that give Russia
increased flexibility in a potential conflict [is long]{.underline}. The
[[precision strike]{.underline}]{.mark} regime's impact on Russian
capabilities is by far the most significant leap providing enhanced
conventional deterrence. Indeed, conventional precision strike
capabilities may take over some of the tasks that Moscow previously
assigned to nuclear weapons. Russian military theorists such as A. A.
Protasov, V. A. Sobolevskii and V. V. Sukhorutchenko explain how
conventional strategic assets could carry out demonstration strikes or
strikes inflicting unacceptable damage on an enemy to force him into
submission\-\--precisely the kind of tasks nuclear weapons would carry
out under a de-escalation doctrine. Although it is difficult to know
whether Russian operational planning incorporates these changes, we do
know that these capabilities are becoming available to Russia\-\--should
it want to use them. Examples of the non-military tools Russia has been
developing include offensive [[cyber]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline},
used for denial of services attacks in Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in
2008, and most likely, for kinetic attacks against critical
infrastructure in Ukraine. Russia's improved [[info]{.mark}rmation
[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline}, as seen in the
disinformation campaigns seen in several European countries, can erode
the will of another state's political leadership or population.
According to Russian General Staff Chief Valeriy Gerasimov, the center
of gravity in modern warfare is not the enemy troops, but the
population's willingness to fight. [A combination of military and
non-military [pressure]{.mark}]{.underline} may be sufficient to
[[sway]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[willingness

The central premise of our argument is that **[Russia and NATO member
states will want to avoid a direct military clash at nearly all costs
(]{.underline}**Putin's desire to protect his regime from imminent
collapse might be an exception). If anything, the tragedies of the war
in Ukraine reveal the enormous economic and human costs of conventional
battles involving the Russian military behemoth. **[Although the risk of
an accidental or unwanted war between Russia and NATO is always present
and has increased, both sides will want to reduce it]{.underline}**.
That is how to interpret Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent
allusion to nuclear war: He rattled the atom in order not to have to use
it. Similarly, President Joe Biden's warning about the certainty of
"World War 3" if Russia attacked NATO was a rhetorical device to reduce
its chances. **[Both sides have signaled that they wish to avoid an
epochal war among them; they threaten it in order not to fight
it.]{.underline}** This is conventional deterrence thinking at its
finest. Familiar red lines are reinforced so that all sides can see them
plainly amid the crisis.

#### A War Between the U.S. and Russia Won't Happen

(Vikas **Shukla**, July 8^th^ 20**15**, author, "Russia vs. U.S. Nuclear
War Is Highly Unlikely,"
http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/07/russia-vs-u-s-nuclear-war-unlikely/)

Russia and the U.S. are aggressively upgrading their nuclear arsenal as
tensions between the two countries continue to mount. Washington is
sending hundreds of howitzers, tanks and other lethal weapons to Eastern
Europe amid Russia's 'nuclear rhetoric." [It has fueled worries that
even an accidental escalation could lead to a nuclear war. Only 2%
probability of a nuclear war between Russia]{.underline} and the U.S. A
Gallup [poll conducted last year found that 50% Americans believe the
country was headed back to Cold War. While the mainstream public opinion
is highly pessimistic, there is very little chance of a nuclear war
between the two powers]{.underline}. Russian political analyst Fyodor
Lukyanov recently told Vox that "a war is not something that's
impossible anymore." Even if the two countries engage in a conflict,
could it lead to a nuclear war? Political analyst Jay Ulfelder, who runs
the Dart-Throwing Chimp blog, conducted a survey. He asked people on the
online political science expert communities two questions: What are the
odds of a Russia vs U.S. war before 2020; and if such a conflict
occurred, whether it would turn into a nuclear war. He collected
responses and ran them through statistical analysis. Ulfelder found that
only 11% people said there was a probability of war between the two
countries. Conditional on war, there was 18% probability that one or
both sides will resort to nuclear weapons. Ulfelder translated these
figures into a single number: 2% probability of a nuclear war between
the U.S. and Russia. Difference between mainstream public and expert
opinion The results of his survey are in line with that of a survey by
Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP). [TRIP asked
scholars, "How likely is a war between the United States and Russia over
the next decade? Please use the 0--10 scale with 10 indicating that war
will definitely occur." They received responses from 2,040 scholars. On
a scale of 0-10, the average perceived risk of war with Russia was
2.55.]{.underline} Their opinions were dramatically different from the
mainstream public opinion. On the occasion of the U.S. Independence Day,
Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a message of greetings to
President Obama that even though some disagreements exist between the
U.S. and Russia, they could peacefully resolve the issues through
dialogue. Putin said relations between Moscow and Washington were "a
crucial factor for international stability."

#### Accidental Nuclear War is Improbable

**Starr 15** -- Contributor that Write for the Bulletin @ the Atomic
Scientists

(Steven Starr, Robin Collins, Robert Green, Emie Regehr, et al September
29th 2015, contributers that write for the bulletin for the atomic
scientists, "New terminology to help prevent accidental nuclear war,"
http://thebulletin.org/new-terminology-help-prevent-accidental-nuclear-war8773)

Since the advent of US and Russian nuclear-armed ballistic missiles and
early warning systems, [the danger has always existed that a false
warning of attack---believed to be true---could cause either nation to
inadvertently launch a responsive "retaliatory" strike with its own
nuclear forces. Fear of a disarming nuclear strike, especially during a
crisis, creates immense pressure to use-or-lose nuclear forces if an
attack is detected. Because launch-ready ballistic missiles allow either
side to launch a counter-strike before nuclear detonations confirm
whether or not the perceived "nuclear attack" is real, the launch of a
retaliatory strike would in reality be a preemptive nuclear
first-strike, should the warning prove to be false---resulting in
accidental nuclear war.]{.underline} This pressure applies to any nation
that might develop the ability to launch before detonation; as a result,
what the United States and Russia decide to do could conceivably act as
a role model for others---depending, of course, on the unique
circumstances of each country. [Consequently, there have been many calls
to eliminate, or at least "de-alert," these launch-ready forces---that
is, to institute changes to the weapons systems that will prevent an
overly hasty launch]{.underline}. [This approach would make it
physically impossible to start a nuclear war by accident, in response to
a false warning of attack.]{.underline} Unfortunately, there has not
been much enthusiasm in either the United States or Russia for
de-alerting or eliminating high-alert nuclear forces. Yet the recent,
escalating tensions between the United States and Russia have increased
the need for both nations to address the dangers posed by their
launch-ready strategic nuclear weapons. Almost all US and most Russian
silo-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)---as well as some
of their submarine-launched ballistic missiles---remain at launch-ready
status, capable of rapid launch within a maximum of 15 minutes after
receiving a warning. These weapons are armed with strategic nuclear
warheads, and the detonation of even one such warhead could kill
hundreds of thousands of people. There is another way to reduce the risk
of accidental nuclear war: Russia and the United States could each
independently adopt a policy of not launching their nuclear-armed
missiles before confirmation of a nuclear detonation on their respective
territories. Such a policy would make it impossible to launch a
responsive or reflexive nuclear strike based upon a false warning of
attack. To help them reach such commitments, the diplomatic world should
address a factor that has spawned confusion and controversy: nuclear
terminology.

**c**]{.underline}]{.mark}ontrol [systems]{.underline} as a precursor to
some type of disarming first strike, but the perception that nuclear
forces and associated systems could be vulnerable or compromised is
persuasive. Or as Hayes (2015) puts it, "The risks of cyber disablement
entering into our nuclear forces are real". While [the [growing
possibility]{.mark} of "[cyber]{.mark} disablement" [should **not** be
**overstated** (notions of a]{.mark} "cyber-**[Pearl

9--11"]{.underline} (Charles 2013) [[have **done little** to help
understand]{.mark} the nature of the challenge]{.underline}),
cyberthreats are nevertheless an increasingly important component of the
contemporary US--Russia strategic context. This is particularly the case
when they are combined with other emerging military-technical
developments and programmes. The net result, especially given the
current downturn in US--Russian strategic relations, and the way cyber
is exacerbating the impact of other problematic strategic dynamics, is
that is seems highly unlikely that either the USA or Russia will make
the requisite moves to de-alert nuclear forces that the new cyber
challenges appear to necessitate, or for that matter to (re)embrace the
"deep nuclear cuts" agenda any time soon.

Assessing the options for arms control and enhancing mutual security

Given the new challenges presented by cyber to both US and Russian
nuclear forces and to US--Russia strategic stability, it is important to
consider what might be done to help mitigate and guard against these
threats, and thereby help minimise the risks of unintentional launches,
miscalculation, and accidents, and perhaps create the conditions for
greater stability, de-alerting, and further nuclear cuts. While there is
unlikely to be a panacea or "magic bullet" that will reduce the risk of
cyberattacks on US and Russian nuclear forces to zero -- be they
designed to launch nuclear weapons or compromise the systems that
support them -- there are a number of options that might be considered
and pursued in order to address these different types of threats and
vulnerabilities. None, of these however, will be easy.

The most obvious and immediate priority for both the USA and Russia is
working (potentially together) to harden and better protect nuclear
systems against possible cyberattack, intrusion, or cyber-induced
accidents. In fact, in October 2013 it was announced that Russian
nuclear command and control networks would be protected against cyber
incursion and attacks by "special units" of the Strategic Missile Forces
(Russia Today 2014). Other measures will include better network defences
and firewalls, more sophisticated cryptographic codes, upgraded and
better protected communications systems (including cables), extra
redundancy, and better training and screening for the practitioners that
operate these systems (see Ullman 2015). However, and while
comprehensive reviews are underway to assess the vulnerabilities of
current US and Russian nuclear systems to cyberattacks, it may well be
that US and Russian C2 infrastructure becomes more vulnerable to cyber
as it is modernised and old analogue systems are replaced with
increasingly hi-tech digital platforms. As a result, and while
[**[nuclear]{.mark}** weapons [and **c**]{.mark}ommand [and
**c**]{.mark}ontrol [infrastructure are]{.mark} likely to be [the **best
protected** of **all**]{.mark} computer systems, [and **"air
gapped"**]{.mark}]{.underline}14 [[from the]{.mark} wider
[Internet]{.mark}]{.underline} -- this does not mean they are
invulnerable or will continue to be secure in the future, particularly
as systems are modernised or become more complex (Fritz 2009). Or as
Peggy Morse, ICBM systems director at Boeing, put it, "while its old
it's very secure" (quoted in Reed 2012).

### 2nc -- No Nuclear Hack Impact

#### It\'s false -- [totally disconnected]{.underline} from the internet.

Threat to Nuclear Deterrence," War on the Rocks,
<http://warontherocks.com/2016/02/the-cyber-threat-to-nuclear-deterrence/>\]

[The [perception]{.mark} that [cyber threats will]{.mark}]{.underline}
ultimately [[undermine]{.mark} the]{.underline} relevance or
[effectiveness of nuclear [deterrence is **flawed**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in at least three keys areas. [First]{.underline} among these [is the
perception that nuclear weapons]{.underline} or their command and
control systems [are similar to a heavily defended corporate network.
The **critical error**]{.underline} in this analogy [is that there is an
expectation of IP-based availability that simply **does not exist** in
the case of American [nucl]{.mark}ear weapon[s]{.mark} --- **they [are
not online]{.mark}**. Even [with **physical access**]{.mark}, the
[proprietary nature]{.mark} of]{.underline} their control system design
and redundancy of the National [Command and Control]{.underline} System
(NCCS) [[makes]{.mark} the [possibility of]{.mark} successfully
implementing [an exploit]{.mark} against either a weapon or
communications system **incredibly [remote]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Also,
[whereas the cyber domain is characterized by significant levels of risk
due to a combination of]{.underline} bias toward [**automated
safeguards** and the liability of single human failures, nuclear weapon
safety and surety are predicated on **balanced elements** of **stringent
human interaction** and **control**. [From **two-person
integrity**]{.mark} in physical inspections and loading, [to]{.mark} the
**[rigorous mechanisms]{.mark}** and **authority** [required for]{.mark}
weapons [release, human]{.mark} being[s serve as]{.mark} a
**[multi-factor safeguard]{.mark}** while retaining the ultimate role to
protect the integrity of nuclear deterrence against cyber
threats]{.underline}.

To a large degree, the potential vulnerabilities caused by wireless
communications and physical intrusions into areas holding nuclear
material are already mitigated via secure communications that are not
linked to the outside and multiple layers of physical security systems.
While there has been a great deal of publicity surrounding the Y-12
break-in of 2012, the truth is that the three people involved never got
near any nuclear material or technology.

Without state-level resourcing in the billions of dollars, [the
technical sophistication required to pursue a Stuxnet-like attack
against nuclear weapons is]{.underline} most likely [beyond the
capability of **even the most gifted group of hackers**]{.underline}.
For all intents, [this **excludes terrorist organizations** and **cyber
criminals** from the field of threats]{.underline} and restricts it to
those nations that already possess nuclear weapons. [Nuclear-weapon
states]{.underline}, however, [have the full-spectrum cyber threat
capability]{.underline} referenced in the Defense Science Board report
[and would most likely be influenced by an understanding of the elements
of classic nuclear deterrence strategy]{.underline}. In the case of
first strike, [no cyber weapon could be expected to perform at a rate
higher than any conventional anti-nuclear capability]{.underline} (i.e.,
not 100 percent effective). [Therefore, an adversary's nuclear threat
would be **perceived to endure**, thereby **negating** and
**dissuading** the effort to use and employ a cyber weapon against an
adversary's nuclear force]{.underline}. Additionally, just as missile
defense systems have been historically controversial due to perceived
destabilizing effects, it is reasonable to conclude that these
nuclear-weapon states would view the attempt to deploy a cyber
capability against their nuclear stockpiles from a similar perspective.

Finally, [the very existence of nuclear weapons is often enough to
**alter the risk analysis** of an adversary]{.underline}. With virtually
no chance of remote or unauthorized detonation (which would be the
desired results of a sabotage event), [the most probable cyber threat to
any nuclear stockpile is that of espionage. Attempted cyber
intrusions]{.underline} at the U.S. National Nuclear Security Agency
(NNSA) and its efforts to bolster cybersecurity initiatives [provide
clear evidence that this is already underway. However, theft of design
information or even more robust intelligence on the location of stored
nuclear weapons **cannot eliminate the potential destruction** that even
a handful of nuclear weapons can bring]{.underline} to an adversary.
[Knowledge alone, particularly the imperfect knowledge that cyber
espionage is likely to offer, is **incapable of drastically altering an
adversary's risk calculus**.]{.underline} In fact, [**quite the opposite
is true.** An adversary with greater understanding of the nuclear
capabilities of a rival is forced to consider courses of action to
**prevent escalation**]{.underline}, potentially [**increasing the
credibility** of a state's nuclear deterrence]{.underline}.

Despite the growing sophistication in cyber capabilities and the
willingness to use them for espionage or in concert with kinetic attack,
the strategic value of nuclear weapons has not been diminished. [The
**[insulated architecture]{.mark}** combined with a **[robust]{.mark}
and [redundant c]{.mark}ommand-[and-c]{.mark}ontrol system**
[makes]{.mark} the existence of any viable cyber [threat]{.mark} of
exploitation **[extremely]{.mark} low**. With the list of capable
adversaries limited by both funding and motivation, it is **highly
[unlikely]{.mark}** that any nation will **possess**, or even **attempt
to develop**, a cyber weapon **sufficient to undermine the credibility
of nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. In both psychological and physical
terms, [the threat of the megabyte will never possess the ability to
overshadow the destructive force of the megaton]{.underline}. Although
the employment of cyberspace for military effect has brought new
challenges to the international community, the role of nuclear weapons
and their associated deterrence against open and unconstrained global
aggression are as relevant now as they were in the Cold War.

Third, [these limitations become even more salient when we consider how
strategic interactions are likely to play out over time during
**repeated crisis interactions**. Because the virtual domain is
**changeable**]{.underline} in a way that the physical world is not,
[actions taken by defenders]{.underline} in the context of a crisis can
[**radically** and **unpredictably alter** an attacker's ability to
**deliver** and **sustain** effects against a target over time.30 Access
and capabilities **are neither guaranteed nor indefinite---they have a
shelf life**]{.underline}.31 [[Footholds]{.mark} into a target's network
that were **time intensive** to develop [can]{.mark} [**unexpectedly
disappear** as]{.mark} vulnerabilities in a [network are **patched**.
Exploits may have a **short shelf life**]{.mark}]{.underline} as
revealing information [about them enables targets to identify
indicators]{.underline} [of compromise]{.underline} (IOCs) [and use
these to **prevent further damage** from specific malware strains or
quarantine malicious traffic using known malware]{.underline}
signatures. An example of the latter is [the US Cyber Command
initiative]{.underline}, beginning in 2018, to share information about
adversary malware by uploading samples to VirusTotal.32 Therefore, [[a
target can "**transition**]{.mark} **from vulnerability**]{.underline}
(to a particular attack) [[to]{.mark} [invulnerability in, **literally,
minutes**]{.mark}]{.underline}."33 [[Third-party disclosure]{.mark}
about software vulnerabilities by governments or private actors
[can]{.mark} also [**unintentionally precipitate** the **loss of access
as exposure**]{.mark} about vulnerability information enables network
defenders to **take measures** to **remedy** them]{.underline}.34 For
instance, the disclosures that began in 2016 by the group Shadow Brokers
of purportedly pilfered US National Security Agency exploits and zero
days ostensibly put US government accesses at risk.35 Put simply, [a
vulnerability upon which an access relies may in theory be only **one
update** or **disclosure** away from being patched.]{.underline}

Thus, [in the context of an **ongoing crisis interaction** between an
attacker and defender, the former's operational tempo is likely to be
**interrupted** by the latter's behavior, forcing the attacker to devote
**additional time** to find or acquire **new vulnerabilities** and
exploits in the **midst** of an offensive operation]{.underline} or
campaign. As Inglis notes, to succeed in an offensive cyber campaign
that unfolds over time, [[attackers must be able to **sustain**]{.mark}
"the efficacy of tools under [**varying conditions** caused by]{.mark}
the defender's response and [the **natural variability** and
**dynamism** of cyberspace]{.mark}]{.underline}."36 [The ability to
build or **acquire new accesses** and **capabilities** "in real time"
during a crisis is **highly limited**.]{.underline}37 Indeed, General
Paul Nakasone remarked in a January 2019 interview on the radical
difference in shelf life between conventional and cyber capabilities:

> Compare the air and cyberspace domains. Weapons like JDAMs \[ Joint
> Direct Attack Munitions\] are an important armament for air
> operations. How long are those JDAMs good for? Perhaps 5, 10, or 15
> years, sometimes longer given the adversary. [When we buy a capability
> or tool for cyberspace . . . we rarely get a **prolonged use** we can
> measure in years. Our [capabilities **rarely last 6
> months**]{.mark}]{.underline}, let alone 6 years. [This is a big
> difference]{.underline} in two important domains of future conflict.38

Therefore, as a 2013 Defense Science Board report notes, "[[offensive
cyber will always be a **fragile capability**"]{.mark} when pitted
[against **network**]{.mark} [**defenders** who are]{.mark}
"continuously [improving **network defensive tools** and
**techniques**]{.mark}]{.underline}."39

Each side can take defensive measures to blunt the impact and
effectiveness of the other's access and capabilities---particularly as
information about them is revealed. Consequently, [strategic accesses
and [capabilities are likely]{.mark} to become **more vulnerable** and
[**less reliable** over time, **shrinking**]{.mark} the set of [cyber
escalatory response]{.mark} options for all parties. [This cycle is
likely to generate **temporal breaks**]{.mark} in the pace of
adversarial engagements]{.underline} in cyberspace, [where states **must
regroup** and **develop** or **rebuild accesses**]{.underline} and
capabilities [during an ongoing interaction. [These pauses are likely to
**diffuse the pressure** that]{.mark} typically accompanies---even
[defines---crisis situations, creating]{.mark} **breathing space** and,
by extension, [room for]{.mark} decisionmakers to]{.underline}
[**deliberate alternative courses of action**, for domestic political
[tensions to cool]{.mark} down, for [**intent** to be

#### Cyber attacks won't take down the grid

Victoria **Craig 16**, Analyst at Fox Business, Citing the Senior
Manager of Industrial Control Systems at Mandiant, "The U.S. Power Grid
is \'Vulnerable,\' But Don\'t Panic Just Yet",
http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/02/02/u-s-power-grid-is-vulnerable-but-dont-panic-just-yet.html

The idea of the nation\'s power grids becoming the next battleground for
cyber warriors could make hacking into consumers' credit card accounts
and personal information seem like child's play. [While U.S. power
companies are likely targeted by foreign governments]{.underline} and
others in increasingly sophisticated breaches, **[[actually shutting off
the lights]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} **[causing
chaos]{.underline}** [[is]{.underline} **[far more
complicated]{.underline}**]{.mark} [than many pundits make it
seem.]{.underline} Dan [Scali]{.underline}, [senior manager of
industrial control systems at Mandiant, a cybersecurity consulting arm
of FireEye
([FEYE](http://www.foxbusiness.com/quote.html?stockTicker=FEYE)),]{.underline}
[explained]{.underline} that [while [cyber
criminals]{.mark}]{.underline} [[may gain access to]{.mark} power and
utility [data systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[it]{.underline}
**[doesn't]{.underline}**]{.mark} necessarily
**[[mean]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the result will be [a **power
outage**]{.mark} and a **total takedown** of power grid control
systems.]{.underline} In other words, [[the power grid is controlled by
**more than just a panel**]{.mark} of digital buttons.]{.underline}
"[Losing the control system is bad]{.underline} from the perspective
that it takes you out of your normal mode of operations of being able to
control everything from one command center, [but]{.underline} [it
**doesn't** mean you've lost control or all the **lights go
out**]{.underline} \[in the city\]," Scali explained. While many of the
systems have been modernized to include digitized control panels, [[if a
hacker were to infiltrate]{.mark} the system, [a utility worker could
still]{.mark} have the ability to]{.underline} **[[manually control the
machines]{.underline}]{.mark}** [by]{.underline} **[flipping a
switch]{.underline}**, pushing a button, or tripping a breaker. As the
world saw with the recent attack in Ukraine, which caused a blackout for
80,000 customers of the nation's western utility, the biggest problem
may be ensuring the power grid's control systems are not vulnerable to
cyber break ins. The January attack in Ukraine was likely caused by a
corrupted Microsoft Word attachment that allowed remote control over the
computer, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Scali
said [[there was **no evidence**]{.mark} from the incident in Ukraine
that the hacker's **malware** was able to [**physically shut down** the
power]{.mark}.]{.underline} "It wiped out machines, deleted all the
files. Kill disk malware made it impossible to remotely control things.
It caused chaos on the business network, and the area where control
system operations sat. But the attacker, we believe, would have had to
actually used the control system to cause load shedding, which caused
the power to go out, or trip breakers to cause the actual problem.
Malware itself didn't turn the power out," Scali said. He said what most
likely happened in that incident was the hacker stole user credentials
and logged into the system remotely. The bottom line: Yes, a similar
event could happen in the U.S. And corporate America is concerned. A
recent survey released in January on the state of information security,
conducted by consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers, showed
cybersecurity as one of the biggest concerns among the top brass at U.S.
power and utilities firms. Part of the problem, Brad Bauch, security and
cyber sector leader at PwC said, is the interconnectedness of the
industry's tools. "Utilities want to be able to get information out of
\[their\] systems to more efficiently operate them, and also share that
information with customers so they have more real-time information into
their usage," he explained. While allowing access to their own
consumption data allows the companies to give their customers more of
what they want, it also opens up a host of access points for hackers,
making the systems more vulnerable than they otherwise would be. But
[[to say that the power grid is susceptible]{.mark} to cyber hackers
[is]{.mark} a bit of [an **oversimplification**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### [Squirrels]{.underline} are a bigger threat to our national grids than cyber-attacks

**Rogue '16** a strategist at the cybersecurity firm of Tenable Network
Security, "Squirrels are bigger threat than hackers to US power grid"
(C. Thomas, January 6, 2016)
https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/Passcode-Voices/2016/0106/Opinion-Squirrels-are-bigger-threat-than-hackers-to-US-power-grid

The [cyberwar drumbeaters have been stoking fears for decades about the
potential of cyberattacks causing devastating physical
damage]{.underline}. A litany of anonymous government officials quoted
in articles regularly warn about coming digital strikes on power plants,
gas pipelines, or water treatment plants. [The perpetrators, they say,
will be rogue nation hackers executing malicious code to pull off some
kind of \"cyber armageddon.\" But until recently **no such attacks have
ever been confirmed** and nothing approaching the kind of physical
destruction the doomsayers foretell has taken place]{.underline}. And
even though two recently reported incidents -- one at [a small New York
dam](http://www.wsj.com/articles/iranian-hackers-infiltrated-new-york-dam-in-2013-1450662559)
and another involving [a Ukrainian power
plant](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-hackers-suspected-in-attack-that-blacked-out-parts-of-ukraine/2016/01/05/4056a4dc-b3de-11e5-a842-0feb51d1d124_story.html)
-- may qualify as real cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, recent
history suggests we should all be wary of pointing to these incidents as
signs that cyberwar is somehow imminent. Every time stories in the media
emerge about computer attacks that cause physical damage -- usually
supported by anonymous sources -- [eventually more reasonable people
investigate those claims and disprove theories involving destructive
cyberattacks]{.underline}. Recommended: [Experts separate fact from hype
in reports of Iranian
hacking](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/2015/1224/Experts-separate-fact-from-hype-in-reports-of-Iranian-hacking)
One of the most commonly cited -- yet erroneous -- cyberevents involves
several blackouts that affected Brazil between 2005 and 2007. [The story
goes that blackouts were the work of hackers. Even \"60 Minutes\"
repeated that claim. Brazil\'s National Agency for Electric Energy,
however, concluded that sooty insulators [caused the power
outages](http://www.wired.com/2009/11/brazil_blackout/)]{.underline}.

Then there was the [2008 explosion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC)
pipeline](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/tuerkei-ermittler-schliessen-cyberangriff-bei-pipeline-explosion-aus-1.2529345)
in Turkey. [No less than four unnamed sources claimed it was a
cyberattack despite the fact that the pipeline owner said the valves
involved in the blast weren\'t attached to any network.]{.underline}
Ever since
[Stuxnet](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/2014/0225/Exclusive-New-thesis-on-how-Stuxnet-infiltrated-Iran-nuclear-facility),
the computer worm discovered in 2010 [that damaged the Iranian nuclear
program](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/),
many experts have warned a that torrent of other computer attacks on
critical infrastructure would follow. They had a smoking gun the
following year when [Russian hackers broke into a small Illinois water
facility](http://www.wired.com/2011/11/water-pump-hack-mystery-solved/).
While the plant\'s control systems were accessed by someone in Russia,
that someone was the contractor for the water facility who happened to
be on vacation in Russia at the time. Even though Stuxnet is the only
confirmed cyberattack leading to physical damage, [a German incident is
often lumped into the category of hacks that lead to property
destruction]{.underline}. [[Many news
articles](https://www.rt.com/news/216379-germany-steel-plant-hack/) and
German government reports suggested that cyberattackers caused
[\"massive damage\"](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30575104) at an
unnamed steel plant by causing the blast furnace to
malfunction.]{.underline} And, again, [no one has gone on the record
confirming this story and the steel plant remains unnamed.]{.underline}
While this event has not been conclusively disproven, there are enough
missing facts to raise considerable doubt. But over the Christmas and
New Year\'s holiday, news stories about two more incidents are once
again stirring up the cyberwar hawks. The first event occurred at the
Bowman Avenue Dam near Rye, N.Y., which is about 20 miles north of
Manhattan. It actually occurred in 2013 but unnamed officials (surprise)
speaking to The Wall Street Journal attributed some kind of breach of
the dam\'s computers to Iranian hackers. While the facts about what
actually transpired at the dam are few, the incident did cause [the
Department of Homeland Security to
investigate](http://www.myrye.com/my_weblog/2015/12/rye-city-statement-on-bowman-avenue-dam.html).
But exactly what DHS discovered, the extent of the so-called \"attack,\"
or how the incident was attributed to Iran remains unknown. What\'s
more, the dam has no electrical generation capability and its only
electronically controlled item is a flood control sluice gate, which dam
officials say has never been fully operational. More facts are available
surrounding the [Christmas Day attack in
Ukraine](http://www.securitylab.ru/news/477942.php) in which the
regional power company blamed malware for turning off substations.
Normally, such claims would be met with deserved skepticism from
cybersecurity pros. In this case, however, a sample of the malware has
been found, which to people who research such things is considered
[pretty damning
evidence](https://ics.sans.org/blog/2016/01/01/potential-sample-of-malware-from-the-ukrainian-cyber-attack-uncovered).
But there\'s still debate as whether the introduction of the malware
into the power company\'s systems was the work of a nation state,
cybercriminals, or simply a random infection that occurs in all kinds of
systems daily. So [despite all the hype, fear, uncertainty, and doubt,
we still don\'t have confirmed, indisputable cases of someone causing a
power outage, or other major infrastructure damage, as a result of a
cyberattack]{.underline}. **[In fact, according to a former deputy
director of the National Security Agency, the biggest threat to the US
power grid isn\'t a cyberattack at all. [It\'s a
squirrel.](https://twitter.com/CyberSquirrel1/status/679345894421086209)
Yes, [squirrels](http://cybersquirrel1.com/) and other animals cause
hundreds of power outages every year and yet the only confirmed
infrastructure cyberattack that has resulted in physical damage that is
publicly known is Stuxnet. Perhaps we should focus less on cyberattacks
and more attention to these furry adversaries.]{.underline}**

The foundation for NATO's next Strategic Concept must be renewed
Alliance cohesion rooted in a common commitment to shared values. Today,
those values are under assault from external and internal challengers.
Waning attention to NATO's core values has resulted in some allies
prioritizing unilateral national decisions over collective Alliance
interests, or using their position to block Alliance activities as a way
to gain leverage in bilateral disputes. Some allies are themselves
manipulating information and distorting data, undermining democratic
processes and the rule of law, even threatening each other. 4 This is
why a mutual affirmation of NATO's democratic foundation must begin with
humility. Our achievements do not always match our aspirations.
Nonetheless, those aspirations matter -- and they are enshrined in the
North Atlantic Treaty. The preamble to the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty
that established NATO declares that the signatories "are determined to
safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of their
peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and
the rule of law."8 Article II states, "The Parties will contribute
toward the further development of peaceful and friendly international
relations by strengthening their free institutions."9 Democratic
deficits exacerbate mutual doubts, which can gnaw at allied commitments
to collective defense and mutual security. These points of disunity can
be used by strategic competitors to destabilize individual allies or
NATO as a whole. Countries with weak protections for democracy,
individual liberty and the rule of law are vulnerable to subversion,
corruption, mis- and dis-information. Malign influences within allied
states could mean that non-NATO countries could influence NATO
decision-making. Regaining cohesion in decision-making is premised on
reinforcing NATO\'s core values. Deficits in internal values can become
external threats. Celeste Wallander has called democratic fragility "the
alliance's Achilles' heel." The 2020 NATO Experts Group report warns
that "a drift toward NATO disunity must be seen as a strategic rather
than merely a tactical or optical problem."10 In recent years, much
strategic discussion has focused on competition among states of "great
power." It is becoming clear, however, that this competition extends
beyond traditional measures of power; it centers increasingly on forms
of governance. Adversaries big and small are selling autocracy as
"efficient." They tout their own systems and use a broad array of tools
to amplify fissures and undermine confidence within democracies. When
they can't do that successfully, they use diplomatic and other means of
coercion. They support illiberal democracies. Others are beginning to
follow their model. This puts democratic resilience at the heart of the
new international system and international competition.

### 2nc -- Alt Causes

#### Energy supply risks are uniquely wedge issues between and controversial debates about diversification guarantee disunity

Eugene **Rumer**, Richard **Sokolsky,** 4-11-**2022**, \"Putin's War
Against Ukraine and the Balance of Power in Europe,\" Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace,
https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/04/11/putin-s-war-against-ukraine-and-balance-of-power-in-europe-pub-86832

Notwithstanding the allies' early show of unity in the wake of the
Russian attack on Ukraine, **[some of their differences and challenges
to a more robust NATO posture have not disappeared
entirely]{.underline}**. These include the **[varying interests and
priorities of the EU's and NATO's diverse members,]{.underline}** as
well as likely disagreements over which threats and challenges should be
privileged in resource allocation decisions **[(among issues ranging
from the Russian threat]{.underline}**, China, climate change,
pandemics, immigration, borders, refugees, **[or diversification of
energy supplies]{.underline}**). **[It would be prudent to not take for
granted that Europe will forge]{.underline}** the **[political
unity]{.underline}** and raise the billions of euros it will require to
create a first-class military that might substitute for or provide a
substantial addition to NATO's military kit.¶ Moreover, the unanimity
with which Europe came together to impose sanctions on Russia and help
Ukraine is likely due to the fact that Ukraine is
***[not]{.underline}*** a NATO member, and demonstrations of solidarity
with it do not involve defense commitments through NATO's Article 5.
**[In the event of a Russian attack against a NATO member country, the
specter of an all-out war with Russia may lead some allies to
demonstrate less resolve and more caution and hesitation]{.underline}**.
¶ One headline is likely to become a trend line: Putin has
[confirmed](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2022-03/news/putin-orders-russian-nuclear-weapons-higher-alert)
that nuclear weapons are useful for a wide range of deterrence and
coercive purposes to go along with what will still be formidable
conventional capabilities in a short-war scenario, such as a quick land
grab in the Baltic region. Several implications flow from this
development.¶ First, notwithstanding rhetoric about defending every inch
of NATO territory and the alliance's impressive show of resolve, NATO
may be unable or unwilling to conduct an Article 5 intervention against
a Russian attack. The alliance may choose instead to form a coalition of
willing NATO countries to defend vulnerable countries on its eastern
flank. ¶ Second, against the backdrop of renewed Russian nuclear threats
and an unreconstructed Putin determined to achieve his long-standing
geopolitical ambitions in Europe, NATO will need to rethink its
conventional and nuclear doctrine and capabilities. Three key questions,
fraught with political and geostrategic consequences, will need to be
confronted:¶ First, should the alliance try to muster the political
unity and massive resources that would be required to shift from a
trip-wire posture to provide deterrence and reassurance to a
war-fighting posture?¶ Second, will NATO need to rethink the balance
between conventional and nuclear capabilities in its military doctrine?¶
Finally, does the alliance need to do a fundamental rethink of its
nuclear doctrine and declaratory policy---specifically, whether, how,
and under what circumstances it should threaten or actually use nuclear
weapons against Russian forces on the battlefield or against Russian
territory?¶ Finally, the risks of inadvertent escalation could increase
significantly if Russia relied more on its nonstrategic nuclear forces.
To mitigate these risks, the United States and NATO will need to restore
and upgrade military communications and deconfliction procedures with
the Russian military and resume dialogue on stabilizing arms control and
confidence-building measures as soon as possible.¶ Amid all the
uncertainty, one thing is certain: [the NATO alliance cannot afford to
be trapped by institutional inertia, path dependent choices, or an
assumption that a weakened Russia will stay Putin's hand. To the
contrary, Putin is likely to double down on his reckless gamble in
Ukraine rather than stand down.]{.underline}

### 1nc -- No Econ Impact 

#### No econ impact 

**Walt 20** \[Stephen M. Walt is the Robert and Renée Belfer professor
of international relations at Harvard University. "Will a Global
Depression Trigger Another World War?", May 13^th^,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/\]

On balance, however, [I do [not]{.mark} think that **[even]{.mark} the
[extraordinary economic conditions]{.mark} we are witnessing today are
going to have much [impact]{.mark} on the [likelihood of
war]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Why? First of all, [[if depressions were
a]{.mark} powerful [cause]{.mark} of war, **[there would be a]{.mark}
[lot more]{.mark}** of the latter.]{.underline} To take one example,
[**[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [suffered 40]{.mark} or more
[recessions]{.mark}** since the country was founded, yet it has
[fought]{.mark} perhaps [20]{.mark} interstate [wars, most]{.mark} of
them [**unrelated** to the]{.mark} state of the
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To paraphrase the economist Paul
Samuelson's famous quip about the stock market, [[if recessions were
a]{.mark} powerful [cause of war, **they would have predicted "nine out
of the last five**]{.mark}]{.underline} (or fewer)."

Second, [[states do not start wars unless they believe they will **win a
quick and**]{.mark} **relatively [cheap victory]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
As John Mearsheimer showed in his classic book Conventional Deterrence,
[national leaders avoid war when they are convinced it will be long,
bloody, costly, and uncertain. To choose war, political leaders have to
convince themselves they can either win a quick, cheap, and decisive
victory or achieve some limited objective at low cost]{.underline}.
Europe went to war in 1914 with each side believing it would win a rapid
and easy victory, and Nazi Germany developed the strategy of blitzkrieg
in order to subdue its foes as quickly and cheaply as possible. Iraq
attacked Iran in 1980 because Saddam believed the Islamic Republic was
in disarray and would be easy to defeat, and George W. Bush invaded Iraq
in 2003 convinced the war would be short, successful, and pay for
itself.

The fact that each of these leaders miscalculated badly does not alter
the main point: [**[No matter what a country's economic condition
might]{.mark} [be]{.mark}**, its [leaders will not go to war unless they
think they can do so]{.mark} quickly, cheaply, and [with a reasonable
probability of success]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Third, and most important, [the **[primary motivation for]{.mark} most
[war]{.mark}s [is]{.mark} the [desire for security, not economic
gain.]{.mark}**]{.underline} For this reason, [the [odds of war increase
when states believe]{.mark} the long-term [balance of power]{.mark} may
be [shifting against them]{.mark}, when they are convinced that
adversaries are unalterably hostile and cannot be accommodated, and when
they are confident they can reverse the unfavorable trends and establish
a secure position if they act now]{.underline}. The historian A.J.P.
Taylor once observed that "every war between Great Powers \[between 1848
and 1918\] ... started as a preventive war, not as a war of conquest,"
and that remains true of most wars fought since then.

[The bottom line: [Economic conditions]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., a
depression) [may affect the broader political environment in which
decisions for war or peace are made, but **they [are only one factor
among many]{.mark} and [rarely the most
significant]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Even]{.mark} if the COVID-19
pandemic has [large, lasting]{.mark}, and [negative effects on the world
economy]{.mark}---as seems quite likely---it is **[not likely to
affect]{.mark} the [probability of war]{.mark} very much,**]{.underline}
especially in the short term.

The final significant outcome addresses [a dog]{.underline} that
[hasn\'t barked]{.underline}: the effect of the Great Recession on
cross-border conflict and violence. [During the initial stages of the
crisis, multiple [analysts asserted]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} financial
[crisis would lead states to]{.mark} increase their [use of
force]{.mark}]{.underline} as a tool for staying in power.42 They voiced
genuine concern that the global economic downturn would lead to an
increase in conflict---[whether [through]{.mark}]{.underline} greater
internal [repression, [diversionary wars, arms races, or]{.mark} a
ratcheting up of [great power conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Violence in the Middle East, border disputes in the South China Sea, and
even the disruptions of the Occupy movement fueled impressions of a
surge in global public disorder. [**[The aggregate data suggest
otherwise]{.mark}**, however]{.underline}. The Institute for Economics
and Peace has concluded that \"[[the average level of peacefulness in
2012 is]{.mark} approximately [the same as]{.mark} it was in
[2007]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"43 [[Interstate
violence]{.underline}]{.mark} in particular [has [declined]{.mark} since
the start of the financial crisis, [as have military
expenditures]{.mark}]{.underline} in most sampled countries. Other
[[studies confirm]{.mark} that]{.underline} [[the]{.mark} Great
[Recession has not triggered]{.mark} any increase in [violent
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Lotta Themner and Peter Wallensteen
conclude: \"\[T\]he pattern is one of relative stability when we
consider the trend for the past five years.\"44 [The]{.underline}
secular [decline in violence that started with the end of the Cold War
has not been reversed]{.underline}. Rogers Brubaker observes that

Such [[comparisons between the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [today [and Germany in the]{.mark}
19[30s are]{.mark} becoming [commonplace]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a
professional historian, I would like to offer what seems to me a better
analogy. Our Tranquil Times [Journalists are]{.underline} fond of
[saying]{.underline} that [we are living in]{.underline} a time of
["unprecedented" instability. **[In reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as
numerous studies have shown, [[our time is]{.mark} a period of
[**remarkable stability** in terms of conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
fact, viewed globally, there has been a small uptick in organized lethal
violence since the misnamed Arab Spring. But even allowing for the
horrors of the Syrian civil war, [the world is an order of magnitude
less dangerous than]{.underline} it was [in the 1970s]{.underline} and
1980s, and a haven of peace and tranquility compared with the period
between 1914 and 1945. This point matters because [[the defining feature
of]{.mark} interwar [fascism was]{.mark} its
[militarism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fascists wore uniforms. They marched
in enormous and well-drilled parades and they planned wars. **[That is
[not what we see today]{.mark}]{.underline}**. So [why do so many
commentators feel]{.underline} that [we are living through
"unprecedented instability?" The answer]{.underline}, aside from plain
ignorance of history, [is that [political populism has become a global
phenomenon]{.mark}]{.underline}, and established politicians and
political parties are struggling even to understand it, much less resist
it. [[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark} populism is not such a mysterious thing,
if one only has some historical knowledge. [[The]{.mark} important
[point is not to]{.mark} make the mistake of [confus]{.mark}ing [it with
fascism]{.mark}]{.underline}, which it resembles in only a few respects.
Rather like a television chef, I shall describe a recipe for populism,
based on historical experience. It is a simple recipe, with just five
ingredients. Five Ingredients for A Populist Backlash The first of these
ingredients is a rise in immigration. In the past 45 years, the
percentage of the population of the United States that is foreign-born
has risen from below 5 percent in 1970 to over 13 percent in
2014---almost as high as the rates achieved between 1860 and 1910, which
ranged between 13 percent and an all-time high of 14.7 percent in 1890.
So when people say, as they often do, that "the United States is a land
based on immigration," they are indulging in selective recollection.
There was a period, between 1910 and 1970, when immigration drastically
declined. It is only in relatively recent times that we have seen
immigration reach levels comparable with those of a century ago, in what
has justly been called the first age of globalization. Ingredient number
two is an increase in inequality. Drawing on the work done on income
distribution by Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, we can see that [[we
have]{.mark} recently [regained the heights of inequality]{.mark} that
were last seen in the pre-World War I period]{.underline}. The share of
income going to the top one percent of earners is back up from below 8
percent of total income in 1970 to above 20 percent of total income. The
peak before the financial crisis, in 2007, was almost exactly the same
as the peak on the eve of the Great Depression in 1928. Ingredient
number three is the perception of corruption. For populism to thrive,
people have to start believing that the political establishment is no
longer clean. Recent Gallup data on public approval of institutions in
the United States show, among other things, notable drops in the
standing of all institutions save the military and small businesses.
Just 9 percent of Americans have "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of
confidence in the U.S. Congress---a remarkable figure. It is striking to
see which other institutions are down near the bottom of the league. Big
business is second-lowest, with just 21 percent of the public expressing
confidence in it. Newspapers, television news, and the criminal justice
system fare only slightly better. What is even more remarkable is the
list of institutions that have fallen furthest in recent times: the U.S.
Supreme Court now has just a 36 percent approval rating, down from a
historical average of 44 percent, while the Presidency has dropped from
43 percent to 36 percent approval. The financial crisis appears to have
convinced many Americans---and not without good reason---that there is
an unhealthy and likely corrupt relationship between political
institutions, big business, and the media. The fourth ingredient
necessary for a populist backlash is a major financial crisis. The three
biggest financial crises in modern history---if one uses the U.S. equity
market index as the measure---were the crises of 1873, 1929, and 2008.
Each was followed by a prolonged period of depressed economic
performance, though these varied in their depth and duration. In the
most recent of these crises, the peak of the U.S. stock market was
October 2007. With the onset of the financial crisis, we essentially
replayed for about a year the events of 1929 and 1930. However,
beginning in mid to late 2009, we bounced out of the crisis, thanks to a
combination of monetary, fiscal, and Chinese stimulus, whereas the Great
Depression was characterized by a deep and prolonged decline in stock
prices, as well as much higher unemployment rates and lower growth. The
first of these historical crises is the least known: the post-1873
"great depression," as contemporaries called it. What happened after
1873 was nothing as dramatic as 1929; it was more of a slow burn. The
United States and, indeed, the world economy went from a financial
crisis---which was driven by excessively loose monetary policy and real
estate speculation, amongst other things---into a protracted period of
deflation. Economic activity was much less impaired than in the 1930s.
Yet the sustained decline in prices inflicted considerable pain,
especially on indebted farmers, who complained (in reference to the then
prevailing gold standard) that they were being "crucified on a cross of
gold." We have come a long way since those days; gold is no longer a key
component of the monetary base, and farmers are no longer a major part
of the workforce. Nevertheless, in my view, the period after 1873 is
much more like our own time, both economically and politically, than the
period after 1929. There is still one missing ingredient to be added. If
one were cooking, this would be the moment when flames would leap from
the pan. The flammable ingredient is, of course, the demagogue, for
populist demagogues react vituperatively and explosively against all of
the aforementioned four ingredients. Kearney's Cause Now, [my argument
is not intended to dismiss]{.underline} or downplay [those elements
of]{.underline} Donald [Trump's campaign]{.underline} for President of
the United States [that have been]{.underline} implicitly, if not
explicitly, [racist]{.underline}. Nor do I treat lightly the various
signals he has given of indifference to, or at least ignorance of, the
U.S. Constitution. [My point is that these demerits do not by themselves
qualify Trump for comparison with Mussolini]{.underline}, much less with
Hitler. Rather, I want to argue that Trump has much more in common with
the demagogues of the earlier, lesser depression of the late nineteenth
century, and that it is to that period that we should look for
historical analogies and insights. The best illustration of my case is
the now forgotten figure of Denis Kearney, leader of the Workingmen's
Party of California and the author of the slogan "The Chinese Must Go!"
Himself an Irish immigrant to the United States---as opposed to the son
of a Scottish immigrant and grandson of a German, which is what Donald
Trump is---Kearney was part of a movement of nativist parties and
"Anti-Coolie" clubs that sought to end Chinese immigration into the
United States. The report of the Joint Special Committee to Investigate
Chinese Immigration in 1877 gives a flavor of the times. "The Pacific
coast must in time become either Mongolian or American," was the
committee's view. The report argued that the Chinese brought with them
the habits of despotic government, a tendency to lie in court, a
weakness for tax evasion and "insufficient brainspace \[...\] to furnish
\[the\] motive power for self-government." Moreover, Chinese women were
"bought and sold for prostitution and treated worse than dogs," while
the Chinese were "cruel and indifferent to their sick." Giving such
inferior beings citizenship, the committee's report declared, "would
practically destroy republican institutions on the Pacific coast." The
realities were, it scarcely needs to be said, very different. According
to the "Six Companies" of Chinese in San Francisco---corporate bodies
that represented the Chinese population of the city---there was
compelling evidence that Chinese immigration was a boon to California.
Not only did the Chinese provide labor for the state's rapidly
developing railroads and farms; they also tended to improve the
neighborhoods in which they settled. Moreover, there was no evidence of
a disproportionate Chinese role in gambling and prostitution. In fact,
statistics showed that the Irish were more of a charge on the city's
hospital and almshouse than the Chinese. Nevertheless, a powerful
coalition of "laboring men and artisans," small businessmen and
"grangers" (the term used to describe those who aimed to shift the
burden of taxation onto big business and the rich) rallied to Kearney's
cause. As one shrewd contemporary observer noted, part of his appeal was
that he was attacking not just the Chinese, but also the big steamship
and railroad companies that profited from employing Chinese labor, not
to mention the corrupt two-party establishment that ran San Francisco
politics: Neither Democrats nor Republicans had done, nor seemed likely
to do, anything to remove these evils or to improve the lot of the
people. They were only seeking (so men thought) places or the chance of
jobs for themselves, and could always be bought by a powerful
corporation. Working men must help themselves; there must be new methods
and a new departure \[...\] The old parties, though both denouncing
Chinese immigration in every convention they held, and professing to
legislate against it, had failed to check it \[...\] Everything, in
short, was ripe for a demagogue. Fate was kind to the Californians in
sending them a demagogue of a mean type, noisy and confident, but with
neither political foresight nor constructive talent. Kearney may have
lacked foresight and "constructive talent," but there is no gainsaying
what he and his ilk were able to achieve. Beginning with the Page Law
(1875) prohibiting the immigration of Asian women for "lewd or immoral
purposes," American legislators scarcely rested until Chinese
immigration to the United States had been stopped altogether. The
Chinese Exclusion Act (1882) suspended immigration of Chinese for 10
years, introduced "certificates of registration" for departing laborers
(effectively re-entry permits), required Chinese officials to vet
travelers from Asia, and, for the first time in American history,
created an offense of illegal immigration, with the possibility of
deportation as a part of the penalty. The Foran Act (1885) banned all
contract laborers from immigrating to America. Legislation passed in the
Scott Act (1888) banned all Chinese from travel to the United States
except "teachers, students, merchants, or travelers for pleasure." In
all, between 1875 and 1924, more than a dozen pieces of legislation
served to restrict and finally end altogether Chinese immigration. No
one should therefore underestimate the power of populism. For all his
coarseness and bombast, Denis Kearney and his allies effectively sealed
the American border along the Pacific coast of the United States;
indeed, one cartoon of the time depicted them constructing a wall across
the San Francisco harbor. In the 1850s and 1860s, as many as 40 percent
of all Chinese emigrants had travelled beyond Asia, though the numbers
arriving in the United States had in fact been relatively small (between
1870 and 1880, a total of 138,941 Chinese immigrants came, just 4.3
percent of the total, a share dwarfed by the vast European exodus across
the Atlantic in the same period). What exclusion did ensure in the late
nineteenth was that Chinese immigration would not grow, as it surely
would have, but instead dwindled and then ceased. Ironies Populism,
then, is not just a form of political entertainment. One sometimes hears
it said of Donald Trump: "Ah, he says wild things on the campaign trail,
but when he is president it will be fine." History suggests otherwise.
It suggests that men who threaten to restrict immigration---as well as
to impose tariffs and to discourage capital export, as populists
generally do---mean what they say. Indeed, populists are under a special
compulsion to enact what they pledge in the campaign trail, for their
followers are fickle to begin with. In the case of Trump, most have
already defected from the Republican Party establishment. If he fails to
deliver, they can defect from him, too. Of course, populists are bound
eventually to disappoint their supporters. For populism is a toxic brew
as well as an intoxicating one. Populists nearly always make life
miserable for whichever minorities they chose to scapegoat, but they
seldom make life much better for the people whose ire they whip up.
Whatever the demagogues may promise---and they always promise "jam
today"---populism tends to have significantly more economic costs than
benefits. Restricting immigration, imposing tariffs on imported goods,
penalizing firms for investing abroad: such measures, if adopted by an
American government in 2017, would be almost certain to reduce growth
and employment, rather than the reverse. That has certainly been the
Latin American experience---and few regions of the world have run the
populist experiment more often. The foreign dimension brings us to a
final irony. [Despite their habitual insistence on narrow national
self-interest, populists are nearly always part of a global
phenomenon]{.underline}. Globalization had been making enormous strides
prior to 1873, with world trade, migration, and international capital
flows growing at unprecedented rates. But the crisis of that year
generated a populist backlash against globalization that was itself
global in its scope. Then, just as now, the principal targets of the
demagogues were immigration, free trade, and high finance. Just as the
United States excluded immigrants and raised tariffs, so did European
countries by adopting similar discriminatory measures. In Bismarck's
Germany, populism was often antisemitic---as it was in the France of the
Dreyfus Affair---while in late Victorian Britain it was anti-Irish.
Tariffs went up almost everywhere except in Britain. [Populism today has
a similarly global quality]{.underline}. In June, [the British vote to
leave the European Union was hailed by populists right across the
European continent as well as by]{.underline} Donald [Trump]{.underline}
in the United States and, implicitly, by Vladimir Putin in Russia.
Yielding to the Complicators [Let me conclude with]{.underline} a note
of [**qualified optimism**. Because populism is not fascism, **[populist
victories should not be construed as harbingers of
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}---if anything, the opposite is true. In the
1870s and 1880s, [[populists]{.mark} did achieve significant reductions
in globalization]{.underline}: not only immigration restrictions, but
also higher tariffs. [But they [did not form many]{.mark} national
[governments]{.mark}]{.underline}, and they did not subvert any
constitutions. [**[Nor were populists]{.mark} much [interested in
starting wars]{.mark}**; if anything, [they lent towards
isolationism]{.mark} and viewed imperialism as just another big business
racket]{.underline}. In most countries, the populist high tide was in
the 1880s. What came next---in many ways as a reaction to populism, but
also as an alternative set of policy solutions to the same public
grievances---was Progressivism in the United States and socialism in
Europe. Perhaps something similar will also happen in our time. Perhaps
that is something to look forward to. Nevertheless, we would do well to
remember that [[World War I broke out during the progressive not]{.mark}
the [populist era]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The world]{.mark} today
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}, as I observed at the outset, [**[in much less
turmoil]{.mark}** than one might infer]{.underline} from television
news. Nevertheless, [the economic and social consequences of
globalization and the]{.underline} most recent [financial crisis sowed
the seeds for the populist backlash]{.underline} that we now see.
[Populists are not fascists. They **prefer trade wars to actual
wars**]{.underline}; administrative border walls to more defensible
fortifications. The maladies they seek to cure are not imaginary:
uncontrolled rising immigration, widening inequality, free trade with
"unfree" countries, and political cronyism are all things that a
substantial section of the electorate have some reason to dislike. The
problem with populism is that its remedies are wrong and, in fact,
counterproductive. [What [we]{.mark} most [have to
fear]{.mark}]{.underline}---as was true of Brexit---[**is [not]{.mark}
therefore [Armageddon]{.mark}**[, but]{.mark} something more prosaic:
[an attempt to reverse]{.mark} certain [aspects of globalization,
followed by disappointment]{.mark}]{.underline} when the snake oil does
not really cure the patient's ills, [[followed by]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [emergence of a [new]{.mark} and ostensibly [more
progressive]{.mark} set of [remedies]{.mark}]{.underline} for our
current malaise. The "terrible simplifiers" may have their day then. But
they will end up yielding power to well-intentioned complicators, those
more congenial to educated elites, but probably every a bit as
dangerous, if not more so.

### 1nc -- No Democracy Impact

Regime Type and the Democratic Peace", 2/19/2021,
https://dainachiba.github.io/research/make2dem/Make2Dem.pdf

[The democratic peace]{.underline}---the observation that democracies
are less likely to fight each other than are other pairings of
states---[is one of the most widely acknowledged empirical regularities
in international relations. Prominent scholars have even characterized
the relationship as an empirical law]{.underline} (Levy 1988; Gleditsch
1992). The discovery of a special peace in liberal dyads stimulated
enormous scholarly debate and led to, or reinforced, a number of policy
initiatives by various governments and international organizations.
Although a broad consensus has emerged among researchers regarding the
empirical correlation between joint democracy and peace, disagreement
remains as to its logical foundations. Numerous theories have been
proposed to account for how democracy produces peace, if only dyadically
(e.g., Russett 1993; Rummel 1996; Doyle 1997; Schultz 2001).

[At the **same time**, peace appears likely to foster or maintain
democracy]{.underline} (Thompson 1996; James, Solberg, andWolfson 1999).
A vast swath of research in political science and economics proposes
explanations for the origins of liberal government involving variables
such as economic development (Lipset 1959; Burkhart and Lewis-Beck 1994;
Przeworski et al. 2000; Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Epstein et al. 2006)
and inequality (Boix 2003), political interests (Downs 1957; Bueno de
Mesquita et al. 2003), power hierarchies (Moore 1966; Lake 2009), third
party inducements (Pevehouse 2005) or impositions (Peceny 1995; Meernik
1996), geography (Gleditsch 2002b), and natural resource endowments
(Ross 2001), to list just a few examples. [Each]{.underline} of these
putative **[cause]{.underline}**s [of democracy is **also** associated
with various explanations for international conflict]{.underline}.
Indeed, some as yet poorly defined set of canonical factors may
contribute both to democracy and to peace, [making it **look** as if the
two variables are **directly related**, **even if possibly they are
not**]{.underline}.

We seek to contribute to this literature, not by proposing yet another
theory to explain how democracy vanquishes war, but by estimating the
causal effect of joint democracy on the probability of militarized
disputes using a quasi-experimental research design. We begin by noting
that [some of the **common causes** of democracy and peace may be
**unobservable**, generating an **endogenous relations**hip between the
two. Theories of democracy and explanations for peace are at a
**formative state**; it is **not possible** to utilize detailed,
validated and widely accepted models of each of these processes to
assess their interaction]{.underline}. Indeed, [to a **remarkable
degree** democracy and peace each remain **poorly understood** and
**weakly accounted** for **empirically**, despite their central roles in
international politics. We address the risk of spurious correlation by
applying an **instrumental variables approach**. Having **taken into
account possible endogeneity** between democracy and peace, we find that
joint democracy does **not** have **a**n **independent** pacifying
effect on interstate conflict. Instead]{.underline}, our [findings show
that democratic countries are **more likely** to attack other
democracies than are non-democracies]{.underline}. Our [results **call
into question** the]{.underline} large body of [theory that]{.underline}
has been proposed to [account for]{.underline} the [**apparent**
pacifism of democratic dyads]{.underline}.

Humanity," p. 124-126\]

Are we safe now from events like this? Or are we more vulnerable? [Could
a pandemic threaten **humanity**'s future?]{.underline}10 The Black
Death was not the only biological disaster to scar human history. It was
not even the only great bubonic plague. In 541 CE the Plague of
Justinian struck the Byzantine Empire. Over three years it took the
lives of roughly 3 percent of the world's people.11 When Europeans
reached the Americas in 1492, the two populations exposed each other to
completely novel diseases. Over thousands of years each population had
built up resistance to their own set of diseases, but were extremely
susceptible to the others. The American peoples got by far the worse end
of exchange, through diseases such as measles, influenza and especially
smallpox. During the next hundred years a combination of invasion and
disease took an immense toll---one whose scale may never be known, due
to great uncertainty about the size of the pre-existing population. We
can't rule out the loss of more than 90 percent of the population of the
Americas during that century, though the number could also be much
lower.12 And it is very difficult to tease out how much of this should
be attributed to war and occupation, rather than disease. As a rough
upper bound, the Columbian exchange may have killed as many as 10
percent of the world's people.13 Centuries later, [the world had become
so interconnected that a truly global pandemic was
possible]{.underline}. Near the end of the First World War, a
devastating strain of influenza (known as the 1918 flu or Spanish Flu)
spread to six continents, and even remote Pacific islands. At least a
third of the world's population were infected and 3 to 6 percent were
killed.14 This death toll outstripped that of the First World War, and
possibly both World Wars combined. [Yet even events like these **fall
short** of being a threat to **humanity**'s longterm
potential]{.underline}.15 \[FOONOTE\] [In addition to]{.underline} this
[**historical** evidence, there are some **[deep]{.mark}**er
**[biological]{.mark}** observations and [theories
**suggest**]{.mark}ing that **[pathogens are unlikely to lead to]{.mark}
the [extinction]{.mark}** of their hosts. [These include]{.mark} the
**empirical [anti-correlation]{.mark}** [between **infectiousness** and
**lethality**]{.mark}, the **[extreme rarity]{.mark}** of diseases [that
kill]{.mark} more than 75% of those infected, the observed
**[tendency]{.mark}** of pandemics [to **become less virulent**]{.mark}
as they progress [and]{.mark} the theory of **[optimal
virulence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, there is no watertight case
against pathogens leading to the extinction of their hosts. \[END
FOOTNOTE\] [In the great bubonic plagues we saw [civilization]{.mark} in
the affected areas falter, but **[recover]{.mark}**. The
regional]{.underline} 25 to [[**50 percent** death]{.mark} rate [was
**not enough** to **precipitate**]{.mark} **a continent-wide
[collapse]{.mark}** of civilization]{.underline}. It changed the
relative fortunes of empires, and may have altered the course of history
substantially, but [if anything, it gives us reason to believe that
human [civilization is **likely to make it through** future
events]{.mark} with similar death rates, **[even
if]{.mark}**]{.underline} they were **[[global]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
scale. The 1918 flu pandemic was remarkable in having very little
apparent effect on the world's development despite its global reach. It
looks like it was lost in the wake of the First World War, which despite
a smaller death toll, seems to have had a much larger effect on the
course of history.16 It is less clear what lesson to draw from the
Columbian exchange due to our lack of good records and its mix of
causes. Pandemics were clearly a part of what led to a regional collapse
of civilization, but we don't know whether this would have occurred had
it not been for the accompanying violence and imperial rule. [The
[strongest case]{.mark} against existential risk from natural pandemics
[is]{.mark} the **[fossil record]{.mark}**]{.underline} argument from
Chapter 3. [Extinction [risk]{.mark} from natural causes [above **0.1
percent**]{.mark} **per century** [is **incompatible** with]{.mark} the
**evidence** of [**how long** humanity]{.mark} and similar species have
[lasted]{.mark}]{.underline}. But this argument only works where the
risk to humanity now is similar or lower than the longterm levels. For
most risks this is clearly true, but not for pandemics. We have done
many things to exacerbate the risk: some that could make pandemics more
likely to occur, and some that could increase their damage. Thus even
"natural" pandemics should be seen as a partly anthropogenic risk.

# Solvency Answers

### 1nc -- No Solvency

#### Inconsistent data standards and lack of transparency in attribution makes cyber-operation useless. The US can't cooperate with allies in NATO if they don't understand or trust the intel. 

**Porter & Jordan '19** (Christopher Porter is the chief intelligence

The alliance has a track record of collective action and cooperative
security measures. For example, Operation Active Endeavour helped to
deter, disrupt and protect against terrorist activity in the
Mediterranean in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, in
solidarity with the United States. For the seventh time, the Atlantic
Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative will be among the organizations
privileged to organize an event on the sidelines of the Feb. 15--17
Munich Security Conference. This year in particular, the Atlantic
Council's event, "Defending Human Dignity: Limiting Malicious Cyber
Activity Through Diplomacy," will complement the topics high on the
agenda of the main conference, such as transatlantic collaboration, the
consequences of a resurgence of great power competition and the future
of arms control**[. In the United States, the greatest failures of
response and deterrence to foreign aggression in cyberspace have not
been caused by a lack of intelligence, capability or imagination.
Rather, U.S. policy has been]{.underline}** serviceable in theory [**but
impotent in practice because of an inability to translate technical
findings and intelligence into public support** for sufficiently tough
responses ordered by elected political leaders]{.underline}. [North
Korea's repeated operations]{.underline} targeting U.S. companies and
critical infrastructure [have been met with public skepticism over their
culpability,]{.underline} limiting the strength of retaliatory options
needed to deter further events. Chinese cyber economic espionage
continued for years despite widespread knowledge of China's activities
because [**political leaders found it difficult to confront Beijing**
without undermining U.S. companies in return.]{.underline} Russian
information operations did not sow enough doubt to mislead experts, but
they succeeded in exacerbating the partisan polarization of an
already-divided electorate and its leaders. That inability to translate
the findings of cyber experts into public sentiment and therefore
political action has sidelined America's cyberwarriors, by far the most
technologically advanced and well-resourced in the world. Imagine the
political response of an ally that is asked to burden-share in response
to cyber aggression but is probably much closer to any resulting kinetic
fight than the United States. Now imagine the response of that ally when
it's being asked to take causus belli on faith: The United States is
presenting attribution for a cyberattack elsewhere in the world, but
perhaps is depending on the ally lacking critical details due to
classification, and is presenting that information alongside a request
for help that might well put the ally in the crosshairs of its own
cyberattack or lethal action. [How can allies with different
capabilities to collect, analyze and understand intelligence be part of
a consensus on using sovereign cyber effects to support a NATO
operation? How can a commander achieve a common operational picture to
authorize the use of sovereign effects in a NATO operation if all the
allies are not on the same page with respect to critical attribution and
other technical information needed for a use of effect in an
operation?]{.underline} We all know what a tank looks like on a shared
satellite image, but if you ask three cyber experts to interpret the
attribution for a set of indicators, you are likely to get at least four
answers. [For most U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere, there is simply
a dearth of technical know-how within the government when it comes to
cyber attribution and operations]{.underline}. This is already a
challenge for the United States, with a massive defense budget, Silicon
Valley innovation and an educated workforce to pull into government
service. But for many U.S. allies, tech-savvy public servants will have
long fled for the private sector, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
and academia before reaching ministerial positions. [To its credit, the
U.S. National Cyber Strategy does propose capacity-building measures to
support allies]{.underline}. This means building up law enforcement,
intelligence, and military operational and investigative capability.
[But **even with successful capacity-building programs**, many nations
could, in a crisis, end up in the same place the United States is---with
good options stuck on the shelf while political leaders and their
electorates lack a critical mas]{.underline}s of informed voters to
trust, understand and act on expert findings. [For countries weighing
whether to risk their own blood and treasure in support of an ally's
cyber attribution findings, this hurdle could well prove insurmountable
if not addressed well before a crisis emerges]{.underline}. Many such
countries will no doubt recall being burned when placing too much
confidence in U.S. technical and human sources without an ability to
evaluate the evidence for themselves, as with the Iraq weapons of mass
destruction findings.

[within]{.underline} the EU and **[NATO have a hard time
cooperating]{.underline}** even in the best of circumstances, not to
mention against an actor that uses everything from licit and illicit
finance, hackers, media outlets, and intelligence services.¶ **[The
information domain is the most important venue for hybrid
warfare]{.underline}**. The revolution in information and communications
technology has been one of the most profound societal changes in a long
time. Today[, a large part of how we understand the world, power, and
legitimacy is mediated through social media]{.underline}.7 Therefore,
"**[the process of collecting and organizing information is now a
tremendous source of]{.underline}** economic, political and cultural
**[power]{.underline}**."8 This shift is, naturally, no secret to
Russian strategists who have done their utmost to update their
disinformation toolbox.¶ Russia's vulnerabilities in the information
domain have been exposed on several occasions in the past. For example,
Chechen separatists successfully used the internet in a propaganda war
with the Russians during the Second Chechen War, Russia's image took a
beating in the global media when it invaded Georgia in August 2008, and
the Russian leadership was caught unaware by the pro-democracy Arab
Spring in the Middle East and North Africa and the massive
anti-government protests these uprisings inspired following the Russian
elections in 2011. However, each failure was followed by adaptation and
innovation: after the Chechen wars, Russia increased internet
restrictions and surveillance; after the Georgian war, Russia's
state-controlled television network, RT, extended its global reach to
include Arabic, Spanish, and French audiences; and, after the Arab
Spring, Russia expanded censorship of social media9 (such as a new
treason law that targets human rights activists and limits freedom on
the internet).10¶ Russia's countermeasures were not limited to defense.
Its offensive toolbox was enhanced as well. Following the Arab Spring
and the concomitant protests in Russia, the first reports referring to
the Internet Research Agency (IRA), the St. Petersburg-based troll farm,
emerged.11 The Russian leadership used the IRA to conduct an offensive
against its domestic opponents (e.g., Russian opposition leader Alexei
Navalny as early as 2013), but also international opponents (e.g., the
United States' 2016 presidential election).12¶ While targeting the
United States, Russia's strategy included running fake social media
accounts pretending to be everything from alt-right voices to Black
Lives Matter activists. The goal was to increase polarization and
violence. Evidence of Russian meddling in the 2020 U.S. elections is now
also emerging. A number of reports have described the use of fake
Instagram accounts to discredit then U.S. presidential candidate Joseph
R. Biden, Jr.13¶ Moreover, the Russian disinformation machinery has
sought to amplify the voices of QAnon, a conspiracy theory collective
that believes that former U.S. President Donald J. Trump is the guardian
against a coup and that Hillary Clinton and her allies are running
sex-trafficking rings.14¶ [The Russian disinformation machine often
maintains a high degree of coherence across channels]{.underline} and
regions [in terms of key messages,]{.underline} but not always in
delivery**[. This is to a large degree the result of
coordination]{.underline}** **[from the top]{.underline}** by Dmitry
Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin's press secretary. Peskov's
weekly meetings with representatives of pro-Kremlin media outlets are
combined with guidelines for social media farms and foreign embassies.15
This is what allows for a high degree of coherence (although never
flawless) between the different arms of the Kremlin machinery.¶
[Another]{.underline} less noticed, but no less [effective, way of
pushing Russian narratives against]{.underline} the EU and [NATO is
evident in the Western Balkans]{.underline}. The Western Balkans are
today at the front line between the EU and NATO on the one hand and
Russia on the other. The states of the Western Balkans are on a steady,
but slow, path to integration with the EU and NATO. Up until 2014, the
Russian leadership did not seem to care too much about this, but after
Russia invaded Ukraine that year its ambitions grew in the region.
Montenegro, in particular, concluded association negotiations with NATO
in May 2016 and joined the Alliance in June 2017. Coincidentally,
Montenegro experienced an increase in cyberattacks both in terms of
sophistication, but also in numbers, from 22 in 2012 to more than 400 in
2017.16¶ [Russian leaders wanted to make an example of Montenegro for
states pondering NATO membership]{.underline}. Around the time of the
Montenegrin parliamentary elections on October 16, 2016,
[pro-NATO]{.underline} and pro-EU political [parties]{.underline} as
well as civil society groups and electoral monitors [were targeted by
large-scale]{.underline} distributed denial-of-service ([DDoS)
attacks]{.underline}. The cyberattacks were traced to APT28, also known
as Fancy Bear, a hacking group with ties to Russia's military
intelligence service, GRU.17 There was also a coup attempt ahead of the
elections that sought to topple the government and assassinate
then-Prime Minister Milo Đukanović. The coup plotters were identified as
GRU officers Eduard Shirokov (nom de guerre Shishmakov) and Vladimir
Popov.18 They were indicted in 2017 along with 12 other people with
Russian, Serbian, and Montenegrin citizenship.19¶ **[The
cyberattacks]{.underline}**, intelligence operations, and subversion
**[in Montenegro should be seen in conjunction with Russia's larger
information offensive against the Western Balkans.]{.underline}** A key
instrument in that offensive has been Sputnik Serbia (Srbija), which has
focused on providing pro-Russian, anti-EU, and anti-NATO narratives.
Sputnik has been successful as it allows for free reproduction of its
articles, which results in these articles being widely published by
outlets with few resources.20 In other words, Russian disinformation is
successful not so much because of illegal methods, but rather because it
exploits opportunities presented by the structural transformation, or
crisis, in the media.¶ It is hard to assess the aggregated impact of
this disinformation in the international domain, but some examples can
be illustrating. For example, 42% of Serbians see Russia as their best
partner and 14% the EU. This is the case even while Russian trade and
aid to Serbia is just a fraction of that of the EU.21¶ [The case of
Montenegro provides a vivid example of the combination of offline and
online tools used by Russia, and the Russian leadership's **broader
desire to undermine NATO**]{.underline} and EU membership. By
themselves, the cyberattacks or the information efforts might seem like
minor nuisances, but **[the combination of these different tools is what
makes them potent and gives them synergies.]{.underline}**

### 1nc -- Deterrence Fails

#### Cyber deterrence fails- attribution, ubiquity of tech, and unenforceable threats of retaliation

Nobody Knows Where the Red Line Is for Cyberwarfare; Bloomberg;
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-02/russia-cyberattacks-raise-questions-about-hacking-red-lines

The Department of Defense is preparing [a new cyber
strategy]{.underline} this year that['s likely to include a more
prominent role for deterrence]{.underline}. U.S. officials and policy
experts have been debating whether it's better to dissuade attacks with
the promise of retaliation in cyberspace or elsewhere, or to try to
prevent them by taking offensive cyber measures that cut off rivals'
ability to carry them out. [The Biden administration's strategy will be
based on integrated deterrence]{.underline}---the concept that attacks
can be prevented by threats of economic penalties or other responses
that rely on various levers of U.S. power.¶ Lawmakers from both parties
and experts from outside government are pushing for their own vision of
deterrence. A two-year, congressionally mandated bipartisan effort that
concluded last year, [the Cyberspace]{.underline} Solarium [Commission,
favors a variation of the theme "layered cyber deterrence," which
combines a focus on hardening technical defenses against attacks with
the promotion of international norms against,]{.underline} say,
[cyberattacks targeting civilian infrastructure]{.underline}.¶ Read
More: How Nations Attack Without Bullets or Bombs¶ [Goldstein's faith
that the threat of catastrophic response could prevent state-sponsored
cyberattacks makes him an outlier]{.underline}. Deciding when to respond
would be fraught, because [determining who has carried out any breach
can be tricky]{.underline}. [The best hackers often mask their
identities. Russian hackers]{.underline}, for instance, [have left bread
crumbs suggesting they're North Korean or Iranian,]{.underline}
cybersecurity experts have said. Officials say they've become better in
recent years at determining responsibility for attacks.¶ Unlike nuclear
weapons, which haven't been used since World War II, [the tools of
cyberwarfare are widely available and used regularly for attacks of
varying seriousness. "Redlines are notoriously difficult to define in
cyberspace,"]{.underline} Emily Goldman, a cyber strategist at U.S.
Cyber Command, wrote in a 2022 paper for the journal The Cyber Defense
Review. She argued that [sanctions, criminal indictments, and other
deterrent measures have proven ineffective: "More of the same will not
produce different results."]{.underline}¶ General Paul Nakasone, the
leader of the U.S.'s 6,000-person military Cyber Command and one of the
speakers at Goldstein's event, has dismissed the nuclear parallels.
"[Cyber deterrence is not nuclear deterrence]{.underline}," he told
Congress in April. For the past several years he's overseen an increase
in the Pentagon's continuous offensive cyber operations outside U.S.
borders, under a strategy he's described as "defending forward."¶ The
U.S. began changing its approach when Russian interference in the 2016
presidential election led U.S. leaders to overcome their reluctance for
counteroffensive cyberattacks, according to Jonathan Reiber, who
authored the government's 2015 cyber strategy when he was the chief
strategy officer for cyber policy at the Department of Defense. In 2018,
Congress changed the legal definition of offensive cyber operations,
classifying them as traditional military activity. That same year the
Trump administration issued a classified policy memo that some U.S.
lawmakers said essentially delegated authority to the Defense Department
to conduct them without the White House signing off.¶ Nakasone told
Congress that both the legal change and the policy memo have been "very
helpful." The Biden administration is reviewing the memo, and proponents
of the "defend forward" strategy worry it could decide to restrict Cyber
Command's ability to act effectively.¶ [One problem]{.underline} with
using the threat of cyberattacks as a deterrent [is that cyber
superiority is inherently ephemeral,]{.underline} according to Nakasone.
[While a nuclear arsenal's power is persistent, cyberweapons rely on
exploiting vulnerabilities]{.underline} in code, [which can be patched
and disappear]{.underline} as quickly as they're found. So, unlike
nuclear weapons, Nakasone's cyber arsenal and access routes must change
all the time. [The U.S.'s ability to find and exploit such
vulnerabilities is significant, but its ability to carry out attacks on
specific targets may ebb and flow]{.underline}.¶ [Some academics argue
that "defending forward" is a euphemism for the U.S. waging its own
attacks]{.underline}. In a paper for the Atlantic Council in March,
cyber coercion expert Jenny Jun argued that [the strategy leaves "much
room for misjudgment and misinterpretation" about how the U.S. will
respond and that instead of being a deterrent, it could encourage
adversaries to strike first rather than wait to be compromised
themselves]{.underline}.

always be sophisticated actors able to thwart the most robust
cybersecurity¶ defenses, the success of hostile activity against
networks are the result of poor cybersecurity practices such as
unpatched systems and users not well trained in information assurance
principles. Cybersecurity is an ongoing effort that needs to be
relentlessly monitored and adapted to a constantly changing threat
environment.

[Anticipating, [defence]{.mark} is guaranteed to be **[ineffective
as]{.mark}** a [deterrence strategy in]{.mark} cyberspace because
[cyber]{.mark} [defence mech]{.mark}anisms **[have little
control]{.mark}** [over]{.mark} cyber [attacks.]{.mark}]{.underline}
This deprives defence of any strategic power (Taddeo 2017a, 2017b) [and
transforms it into a means of ensuring resilience of information
systems, rather than a means to deter new attacks]{.underline}. Let me
unpack this analysis. [[Defence in cyberspace]{.mark} is **[porous in
nature]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Morgan 2010); [[every system has]{.mark}
its **[security vulnerabilities]{.mark}** and [identifying and
exploiting]{.mark} them is simply a [matter of
time]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} means, and determination. This makes
ephemeral even the most sophisticated defence mechanisms, thus limiting
their potential to deter new attacks (Taddeo 2017a). At the same time,
even [when successful, cyber defence does not lead to a strategic
advantage,]{.underline} insofar as [dismounting a cyber attack very
rarely leads to the ultimate defeating of an adversary]{.underline}.
[This [creates an environment]{.mark} **[of persistent
offence]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Harknett and Goldman 2016), [where
[attacking is]{.mark} tactically and **[strategically more
advantageous]{.mark}** than defending. An 'offence-persistent'
environment differs from an 'offence-dominant' environment, in that
defence is under constant stress, but is not superfluous, and the
success of the offence is not a given. In an offence-persistent
environment, defence can achieve tactical and operational success in the
short term if it can adjust constantly to the means of attack, but it
cannot win strategically]{.underline}. Offence will persist and the
interactions with the enemy will remain constant (Harknett and Goldman
2016). In this kind of environment, [deterrence by defence is guaranteed
to be ineffective, as defence does not discourage attackers from their
intention to offend]{.underline}. This is even [more so in
cyberspace,]{.underline} where [[uncertainty of attribution]{.mark},
[low entry cost of attacks]{.mark}, and the [inherently vulnerable
nature of information systems]{.mark} **[encourage attackers to test
defences]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In cyberspace, defence remains salient
and necessary, but primarily as a means to guarantee the resilience of a
system once an attack has been launched (and also after it has breached
the system), rather than as a means of deterring attackers (Bologna et
al., 2013; Bendiek and Metzger 2015). [Cyber defence, then, is more akin
to safety engineering, in that it mitigates and manages the risk
following an attack]{.underline} (Libicki 1997; Rattray 2009), [rather
than avoiding them.]{.underline}

#### Too many disagreements for Article 5 invocation

NATO needs to understand it,
https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-russian-cyber-threat-is-here-to-stay-and-nato-needs-to-understand-it/

**[Even if allies wanted to trigger Article 5 over cyber operations,
disagreements about the definitions of threats, origins of attacks, and
pain thresholds in cyberspace can derail the process. Collective
retaliation requires a unanimous vote across NATO;]{.underline}**
building unity across these points is nearly impossible for most cyber
activity. **[Unlike missile attacks or tanks in the streets, few "red
lines" exist to distinguish cybercrime, cyber espionage, and cyber
disruption from digital acts of war.]{.underline}** Beyond the
bureaucratic and logistical limitations of elevating cyber to a casus
belli, **[focusing on cyber-attacks as acts of war distracts from the
more likely Russian digital assaults below the level of armed conflict.
These include ransomware attacks and supply chain infiltrations that
look like criminal activity or espionage. The Kremlin is particularly
adept at the latter.]{.underline}** In the SolarWinds compromise, Russia
hacked one company's software product to access networks of Fortune 500
companies and U.S. government agencies. Spillover from operations in
Ukraine poses an additional risk. The Russians have already deployed
several digital tools to destroy computer data, resulting in corrupted
computers for Ukrainian companies with government support roles. The
same malicious software has also affected several Latvian and Lithuanian
businesses. The danger is another situation like NotPetya in 2017, where
malware self-replicated, spread past Ukrainian targets to cripple
networks in over 150 countries, and created \$10 billion in damages.
**[Each of these scenarios are much more likely than a "cyber doomsday"
that would justify an Article 5 response from NATO
members.]{.underline}** To be fair, policymakers' fears of cyber war
have led to some positive developments for the alliance. For instance,
over the last several years, NATO has developed its own framework for
combining cyber and conventional military capabilities in warfighting.
But allies remain unprepared to deal with "death by 1000 cuts" in
cyberspace. **[Concentrating only on acts of war comes at the expense of
addressing the cumulative costs of low-level cyber threats over time. It
leads to an overreliance on cyber deterrence or defensive whack-a-mole
strategies, neither of which are sustainable.]{.underline}** Threats of
retaliation simply don't deter most cyber-attacks, and it is unrealistic
for defensive measures to stop every hacker.

### 1nc -- Russia Turn

#### Pursuing security cooperation with NATO over cyber sparks confrontation with Russa.

**Zhiping 22** \[Qi Zhiping, Chinese Academy of Sciences 4-22-2022 US
sets dangerous precedents in cyberspace Global Times.
https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202204/1260039.shtml\] 6-14-2022

Paul Nakasone, the Commander of US Cyber Command and Director of the
National Security Agency, noted recently in a testimony before the US
Senate that before the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the
command "supported" Ukraine in cyberspace. After the outbreak, the US
reinforced its "hunt-forward" operation and helped Ukraine strengthen
its cyber defense. In fact, the US interference in the crisis through
cyberspace is much more than just helping Ukraine with its defense, the
US is also supporting it against Russia on all fronts, including cyber
offense and defense, information awareness, digital connectivity and
cyber intelligence, setting several extremely dangerous precedents. The
first precedent is cyber warfare between nuclear-weapon states. [Since
the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US has]{.underline}
repeatedly [stressed]{.underline} that [it will not]{.underline} be
[engage]{.underline}d [in]{.underline} an [armed conflict with
Russia]{.underline} and has refrained from establishing a no-fly zone
and test-launching intercontinental ballistic missiles. This indicates
US clear understanding of the possibility of escalating the situation
and even triggering a nuclear war with Russia. However, [at the same
time, **the US is confronting Russia head-to-head in
cyberspace**]{.underline} even at the frontline. The reason is that the
US believes it can unilaterally control the scale and consequences of
cyber conflict with its technical superiority. However, as the Internet
has gone deep into all aspects of social life, the width and depth of
the impact of cyber warfare may be beyond the control of any country. In
the context of a hot war, [situations won't exactly follow the US script
that whether engagement in cyberspace would be considered armed
engagement or whether it would provoke another nuclear weapon state to
escalate]{.underline} the conflict. Against the backdrop of Russia's
announcement to raise its nuclear preparedness and unspecified
cyberattacks on Russian nuclear facilities, US direct engagement in
cyber conflict with Russia will easily lead to a strategic
miscalculation. The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the US and NATO
in a statement for waging a cyber war against Russia involving a broader
scale of hackers. This is a stern warning against the US' "dangerous
game" in cyberspace which would possibly trigger a conflict between
nuclear-weapon states. The second precedent the US sets is a proxy war
in cyberspace. The US uses China and Russia as imaginary enemies to
promote its cyber strategy of "hunt-forward" and "persistent
engagement." The US is deeply involved in building the cyber power of
Ukraine, using it as a bridgehead for close reconnaissance, network
penetration and cyber attacks against Russia, preparing for its cyber
confrontation with Russia. Apart from Ukraine, the US is also doing the
same in the Asia-Pacific region, hyping China's cybersecurity threats to
China's neighbors and thus luring them into "cybersecurity cooperation"
in an attempt to bring the US cyber tentacles to China's doorstep. This
is similar to US intention of deploying its missile and anti-missile
systems in the vicinity of China and Russia, which not only enhances the
US deterrence and offensive capabilities, but also takes the opportunity
to force China and Russia's neighboring countries to the US' chariot.
The tragedy in Ukraine is a lesson to be learned. For the US, there will
be a greater security dilemma with the pursuit of its own absolute
security in spite of security concerns of others, or even at the cost of
others' insecurity. [With good **intentions to strengthen cyber security
and cooperation with the US**, regional **countries** not only failed to
enhance their own security, but also **put themselves in the vortex of
competition between major powers**, and even became cannon fodder for
major power confrontation.]{.underline} The third precedent has been set
for non-compliance with international rules. [**The US** clamors that
cyber attacks constitute armed attacks, and **pushed NATO** to declare
for the first time at its 2021 summit that \"significant malicious
cumulative cyber activities]{.underline} might, in certain
circumstances[, be considered as amounting to an armed
attack."]{.underline} But the US launched such cyber activities that
should be defined by itself as "armed attacks" against Russia. The US
underlines that all offline rules apply online as well, fabricating
cyber attacks charges, accusing other countries and abusing sanctions.
[At the same time, the US sees the digital world as a \"land beyond
law,\" and does not hesitate to attack other countries\' critical
infrastructure.]{.underline} While advocating democracy, freedom and
human rights and opposing information manipulation and disinformation,
the US cut off the Internet services for Russia, blocked Russia's voice,
and spread disinformation against Russia without limits, in a bid to
confuse the public. Behind these actions is the arrogance of the US and
its blatant double standards for international rules. Coincidentally,
the US completely ignored the international consensus reached last year
of "developing and implementing globally interoperable common rules and
standards for supply chain security," in the UNGGE report, and
deliberately created closed and exclusive small circles to discuss
supply chain issues for geopolitical purposes. [What **the US wants**
has never been universally applicable international rules in cyberspace,
but \"domestic laws\" and **\"rules of its small gang\"** to serve its
own selfish interests.]{.underline} The "framework for responsible State
behavior" which the US claimed to adhere to only holds other countries
accountable, and the US itself is above international rules.
Washington's practices of disregarding international rules have severely
interfered with the efforts of the international community to establish
order in cyberspace, and may even lead to serious consequences of a
collapsed order. [Cyberspace is a common space shared by all countries.
The US should stop "playing the touch ball" in cyberspace. Instead, it
is supposed to shoulder the responsibility of a major power, avoid
strategic misjudgments, and earnestly maintain strategic stability among
major powers and build a peaceful and secure cyberspace.]{.underline}

### 2nc -- No Attacks Now

6-5-2022

[Why hasn't Russia launched major cyberattacks yet?]{.underline} The
lack of full-scale Russian cyberattacks is a phenomenon that has
surprised some experts, including Wertheim. "On some level," he said,
"the reason Russia launched a full-scale war against Ukraine is
precisely that it didn't think cyber means were sufficient. But one
might have expected the war itself to have involved more cyber
operations." It's difficult to know exactly what is behind Russia's
behavior, but experts have speculated about a number of potential
reasons why Russia has hesitated to launch any stronger attacks. Some
have theorized that Russia's cyberwarfare capabilities may have been
inflated, which is why it has not thus far launched a more sophisticated
cyberattack against Ukraine or its Western allies. However, a more
[likely]{.underline} reason may be that [Russia is still weighing its
options carefully, and is simply waiting for the right time to
respond.]{.underline} "It could be that Russia fears retaliation that
would set its cause back, at least at this point," said Wertheim, noting
the relative lack of progress by Russia's armed forces so far. "Perhaps
over time, if and when Russian leaders believe that the situation is
stabilized then Russia would be better able to absorb retaliation, it
could launch a cyberattack then. It's possible." Given the setbacks that
Russia has encountered on the battlefield, combined with the notable
resistance by Ukrainian forces that have held steady against Russia's
attacks for the last three weeks, it may also be a matter of Russia
prioritizing its military actions, according to Wertheim. "There might
just simply be a kind of finite attention problem operating for
\[Russia\]," he said. According to Olena Lennon, an adjunct professor of
political science and national security at the University of New Haven,
setbacks for Russia include the loss of junior, and even some
higher-level, commanders among its military personnel, which may be
affecting its operations on the ground. "We're definitely seeing some
leadership deficiencies that could explain some of these surprises,"
Lennon said. [The US could]{.underline} also [be a target of Russian
cyberattacks US authorities were]{.underline} already [wary of a
possible cyberattack from Russian hackers as a potential response to US
support for Ukraine]{.underline}. That concern has only [increased
following]{.underline} major [sanctions]{.underline} imposed on Russia
by Western powers, as well as escalating rhetoric from Russian President
Vladimir Putin. [Putin described the sanctions as "akin to declaring
war,"]{.underline} and Russian government officials have warned there
will be swift action from Russia in response. US officials warned public
and private entities of potential ransomware attacks after President Joe
Biden announced initial sanctions against Russia late last month. "DHS
has been engaging in an outreach campaign to ensure that public and
private sector partners are aware of evolving cybersecurity risks and
taking steps to increase their cybersecurity preparedness," a DHS
spokesperson said in a statement to the press. [But the strong
response]{.underline} against sanctions that [Russian officials have
warned of has yet to materialize in the weeks since]{.underline}.
Although it's certainly possible that Russia will react to US sanctions
at some future point, the absence of action so far is notable, according
to Wertheim. "It's very hard to sort of assign exact probabilities to
these kinds of things," Wertheim said. "But it's notable that there
hasn't been a response. And I think [it remains a real possibility that
even if the West does nothing more to escalate in a conflict that Russia
could do so]{.underline} by undertaking what it believes is
retaliation." That could be [particularly]{.underline} likely [as the
impact of already-imposed sanctions continues to mount]{.underline}.
Sanctions have had an enormous effect on day-to-day life inside the
country: The value of the ruble, Russia's official currency, has
plummeted to less than 1 cent, and Russian citizens have already seen
price surges, particularly for electronic goods and appliances. The
early price hike has motivated many residents to stock up on items in
case prices continue to rise as the conflict rages on. "For the past few
days, it's been like Christmas for us," one electronics-shop staffer
told the Financial Times. "People are ready to buy things even
\[though\] we have been raising prices every few hours based on the
forex situation." With heavy economic sanctions already in place,
Wertheim says [there are potential risks to pushing Putin further into a
corner, which in itself could motivate]{.underline} Russia to take more
drastic measures --- including, potentially, [cyberattacks]{.underline}
--- as the war continues. "What I most worry about is a circumstance in
which Vladimir Putin thinks that his regime may be teetering and that he
has to do something dramatic to change the status quo in order to
maintain his grip on power," Wertheim said. "And, thus, perhaps his own
personal survival."

#### Russia has threatened retaliatory measures---accuses the US of cyber aggression.

[As the war in Ukraine rages]{.underline}, a long-standing [battle
between Russia and the United States over cyberspace is also heating
up]{.underline}, with a top Russian diplomat warning of "catastrophic"
consequences if the United States or its allies "provoke" Russia with a
cyberattack. [The "information space,"]{.underline} as the Kremlin likes
to call it, [has been a growing domain of U.S.-Russian
conflict]{.underline}, not only in the Ukraine war, but in Russia's
hacking attacks against the presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020 as
well as the congressional elections in 2018. [The two countries briefly
seemed to be working together for common rules for cyberspace last year,
but that cooperation has now exploded.]{.underline} Andrei [Krutskikh,
the top cyber expert at the Russian foreign ministry,
charged]{.underline} in an interview on Monday with the Russian
newspaper Kommersant that the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
had allegedly "unleashed [cyber aggression]{.underline} against Russia
and its allies." He claimed that Washington was using Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky and "the IT Army created by him to carry
out computer attacks against our country as a battering ram." Krutskikh
continued ominously: "[We do not recommend that the United States
provoke Russia into retaliatory measures.]{.underline} A rebuff will
certainly follow. It will be firm and resolute. However, the outcome of
this 'mess' could be catastrophic, because there will be no winners in a
direct cyber clash of states." To back up Krutskikh's claim that the
United States has attacked Russian cyber targets, Kommersant cited a
June 1 comment by Army Gen. Paul Nakasone, head of U.S. Cyber Command.
Speaking about Ukraine during a visit to Estonia, Nakasone told Sky
News: "We've conducted a series of operations across the full spectrum:
offensive, defensive, \[and\] information operations." A Cyber Command
spokesman had no comment. A senior State Department official said
Krutskikh's allegations were "nothing new" and a "rehash" of past
statements. The Biden administration, for its part, accused Russia last
month of conducting "malicious cyber activity" against Ukraine,
including an attack on a commercial satellite communications network
that damaged systems in other European countries. The State Department
condemned Russia's cyber-meddling, but the senior official said the
United States hasn't seen the "huge attacks" some were expecting,
perhaps because the Russians "don't want a war on two fronts." Krutskikh
contended that [a "freeze" by the Biden administration in developing a
common approach to cybersecurity had reversed progress made last year at
the United Nations. U.S. and Russian officials had endorsed a joint U.N.
resolution in October outlining a framework for discussing cybersecurity
issues. Krutskikh called it a "historic moment."]{.underline} But at
that time, the Russians were already preparing their invasion of
Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24. Even so, contact between the two
countries on cyber issues has continued, with two meetings since
December and another scheduled in July, the senior official said. The
Kremlin's cyber chief said Monday that Russia was still ready to
negotiate "appropriate legal agreements with all states that soberly
assess the threat of cyberwarfare." But that same day, Russia included
Michele Markoff, the State Department's cyber security coordinator and
the main channel of contact with Krutskikh, on a new list of sanctions
permanently banning travel to Russia. Russia's view of the internet is
fundamentally different from that of the United States, the senior State
Department official said during an interview on Tuesday. Whereas the
United States seeks an open, free and interoperable system, Russia wants
"an internet with sovereign borders," where it can suppress speech it
doesn't like. Russia's obsession with cyberspace partly reflects
Moscow's view that the United States controls the internet and its
governance. A favorite Russian target is a group of experts known as
ICANN, which oversees the internet's system of domain names. ICANN used
to operate under a Commerce Department contract but has been fully
independent since 2016. On Monday, the group published a compendium of
Russia's attempts to rewrite internet rules, through the United Nations
or other international regulatory bodies it seeks to control. From
President Vladimir Putin on down, the Russians quoted in the ICANN
report resent the United States' digital dominance. The U.S.-Russian
contest over cyberspace will play out in this September's election for a
new secretary general of the International Telecommunications Union, a
U.N. agency that could, in theory, take over internet governance. Two
leading candidates are Doreen Bogdan-Martin, an American who currently
runs one of the ITU's bureaus, and Rashid Ismailov, a Russian who has
worked in his country's communications ministry and for Huawei, Nokia
and other companies. Watch that space, folks. The internet confrontation
is a microcosm of Russia's larger standoff with the West. Russia yearns
for recognition as a great power and global standard setter. But as the
war in Ukraine grinds on, [Putin has become ever more prickly, isolated
and angry at his foes]{.underline}. He is severing Russia's connections
to the world, [even as he seeks to dominate cyberspace. His computer is
crashing]{.underline}, and he doesn't seem to know how to reboot.

6/16/2022

The chaos strategy, and the tactical [use of hybrid warfare, was borne
out of the perception among the Russian leadership that Russia is locked
in a form of greatpower competition with the United States and
Europe]{.underline}, as well as increasingly with China. [The stakes are
high: ultimately, it is about the survival of the current Russian
regime]{.underline}.4 For decades since the end of the Cold War, Russian
authorities have been feeding a sense of post-Cold War humiliation that
Russia's security concerns were not sufficiently taken into
consideration, if not downright ignored. This [grievance narrative is
reinforced by a "besieged fortress" mentality at home that is fueled by
a fear of encirclement by NATO forces and exclusion from the European
security architecture. This]{.underline} would have [forced Russia to
choose confrontation over cooperation with the West. The Russian
leadership has the perception that there is a window of opportunity to
take action and make foreign policy and security intentions a
reality]{.underline}5 --- the war with Georgia in 2008 was a harbinger
of Russia's reassertion. What followed were calculated steps aimed at
doing away with an international order the Kremlin leadership feels
cheated by and disappointed with. For Russia, the problem remains that
it cannot compete in a direct contest of national power --- political or
conventional military --- with its peer and near-peer competitors. The
Russian leadership fundamentally feels its conventional military is
inferior to the West's, and especially NATO. Therefore, [as Russia
cannot compete symmetrically, it chooses to contest and disrupt
asymmetrically.]{.underline}6 It follows that Russia has seeded chaos
via asymmetrical means [through disinformation,
cyberattacks]{.underline}, political subversion, business ties, and
economic warfare[, among other tools.]{.underline} The approach has
combined both old and new, drawing on lessons from the successful use of
Soviet-era asymmetric strategies, but amplified with the power of modern
technology and social media. Nonmilitary hybrid tools, as those being
pondered by Russian military planners, are part of warfare per se. 7
Such means represent a coordinated and tailored effort at the strategic
level to reshape the internal course --- be it political, economic, or
societal --- of target countries. Russia uses a synergetic and
convergent toolkit of military and nonmilitary tactics8 in its
protracted conflict with the West, honed by a willingness to alter, by
force if necessary, the Western-led liberal international order. This
effort also seeks to increase Russia's international standing in
absolute and relative terms as well as advance Russian interests against
the West.

#### Err neg -- any effort at security cooperation by NATO is likely to be perceived as antagonistic by Russia

Although [the United States and its allies can make every effort to send
clear signals]{.underline} and communicate effectively with Russian
leadership, [there is always a risk that Russia will
misinterpret]{.underline} U.S. and NATO actions. A variety of factors
beyond the control of the deterring party---including cultural
differences, cognitive biases, irrational behavior, and f lawed
assumptions---can cause the target state to mis-read or misjudge the
actions of its adversary.99 Domestic concerns or political constraints
can also color how a state perceives and reacts to the actions of its
adversary. One potent example of misperception occurred [in
1983,]{.underline} when [the Russians mistook a NATO nuclear warfare
exercise called "Able Archer" as a cover for an actual nuclear strike,
and nearly retaliated in kind.]{.underline}100 Only belatedly did
then-President Ronald Reagan come to the realization that \[m\]any
people at the top of the Soviet hierarchy were genuinely afraid of
America and Americans many of us in the administration took it for
granted that the Russians, like ourselves, considered it unthink-able
that the United States would launch a first strike against them. But I
began to realize that many Soviet officials feared us not only as
adversaries but as potential aggressors who might hurl nuclear weapons
at them in a first strike. . . .101 [This]{.underline} incident
[illustrates the importance of trying to understand how the other side
will interpret one's actions and the dangers of presuming that the
adversary will share the same logic and assumptions.]{.underline}
Moreover, [Russia tends to view any defense- or security-related actions
taken by the United States or NATO]{.underline} in the European theater
[as being targeted at it]{.underline}, regardless of the actual intent
behind these actions. As one RAND report notes, Any actions in Europe to
support American operations elsewhere have been and will be observed by
a Russian military more interested in us than we are in it. It is
critical that operational planning take this into account and that
planners and operators take steps to prevent Russia from mistaking
operations and actions as unintended "signals."102Of course, [Russia may
also make such claims about perceived U.S. and NATO "aggression" with
the aim of justifying its own defense- or security-related
actions.]{.underline} Whether rooted in genuine concern over U.S.
actions or political theater, the reality is that Russia frequently does
not modulate its responses based on the perceived or stated U.S. intent
behind its actions, but rather reacts to transgressions of its redlines
irrespective of the reason behind the violation. Nonetheless, [if U.S.
and NATO planners fail to account for Russian sensitivities and
assumptions when deciding on courses of action, **seemingly minor or
irrelevant actions could inadvertently trigger escalation** with
Russia.]{.underline} Deterrence strategies must also be designed with
careful consideration of the broader context and environment in which
they will be applied. Because some deterrence measures take a long time
to implement, the context might have changed by the time they are
enacted, which can "inadvertently signal aggressive intent under changed
cir-cumstances."103 A recent example was the timing of events when NATO
revealed, in May 2016, that it had installed a 16missile defense site in
Romania and was beginning work on a site in Poland. At the same time,
NATO announced a series of unconnected posture-enhancement proposals in
preparation for the approaching Warsaw Summit. The coincidence of these
actions further convinced Russia that it is the intended recipient of
those ballistic missile defense systems, despite U.S. assurances to the
contrary. In a similar vein, multiple deterrent actions undertaken in a
short time span can have the cumulative effect of crossing a red-line,
even if the individual actions would not have had such a significant
effect. For instance, the placement of newly developed Pershing II
ballistic missiles in West Germany the same year as the Able Archer
exercise drastically raised tensions and Soviet paranoia over U.S. and
NATO actions, leading to the Soviet decision to raise its nuclear alert
statuses and prepare for nuclear war. Policymakers therefore should
"consider delaying final completion or announcements of posture
enhancements that may take place during times of heightened tension and
should routinely reassess posture decisions in the process of being
implemented."104Otherwise, actions that would strengthen deterrence
under different circumstances may counterproductively increase the risk
of escalation. In some cases, deterrence may fail to prevent escalation
because there is too great an asymmetry of stakes or interests between
the parties involved. In these instances, [An enemy that perceives that
its stakes are high will be willing to bear greater costs and,
therefore, will be less sensitive to threats of punishment.]{.underline}
And if that enemy believes that the threatener's stakes are low, there
may be doubt that the threatener is willing to bear the reciprocal costs
of escalation or pay the political price of carrying out the threats.105
[Should Russia believe it faces an existential threat from the United
States or U.S. allies, it will most likely decide that the costs of not
acting outweigh the risks associated with escalating to full-scale
war.]{.underline} Similarly, if the Russian interest in achieving a
certain objective far outweighs U.S. interests in pursuing the
objective, the United States may choose to back down. Putin also has
demonstrated a high level of opportunism and a willingness to use any
low-cost opportunities available to expand the Russian sphere of
influence, destabilize adversaries, or otherwise strengthen Russia's
position in the world order. [If Putin believes the United States and
NATO have a low level of interest in a particular area, he may seize the
opportunity to act, calculating that he can do so without risking
escalation.]{.underline} This may lead to a problematic pattern of
probing for U.S. and NATO resolve and looking for areas of weakness to
exploit. Relatedly, unpublished RAND research suggests that [Putin's
appetite for risk may be high, and will remain so as long as he
continues to enjoy high levels of support from Russian
elites]{.underline} and retains the ability to sell oil and gas to other
countries.1

#### **The link straight turns deterrence and takes out the case --- Russia only has an incentive to start a nuclear crisis when they are provoked --- don't poke the bear!**

U.S. and NATO war games and military exercises can also be leveraged to
enhance resilience against inadvertent escalation. The purpose of
deterrence is to prevent nuclear war and therefore must account for any
number of ways in which it might start. Current American deterrence
policies toward Russia are largely focused on putting barriers in place
to prevent the onset of nuclear escalation by aggression. Such
escalation would almost certainly have a catastrophic \[End Page 222\]
global impact. However, [[Russia has]{.mark} **very [little
incentive]{.mark}** [to start]{.mark}]{.underline} a [nuclear [war
through aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}, [making]{.underline} the
[[probability]{.mark} of this scenario]{.underline} relatively
[[low]{.underline}]{.mark}. An arguably [**more [likely]{.mark}**
[scenario is]{.mark}]{.underline} that the [**[security]{.mark}
situation** in Eastern Europe]{.underline} would
[[precipitate]{.underline}]{.mark} a conventional [[conflict in which
U.S./NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} military [[actions]{.underline}]{.mark},
[strategic misperception]{.underline}, or an accident caused by an
operational error could create a crisis that
[[provokes]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[**nuclear response** by
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Planning for this type of scenario is
[[complicated by]{.mark} the fact]{.underline} that [Russia\'s **already
[uncertain]{.mark}** operational [threshold for nuclear use]{.mark} is
**likely to shift** in a conflict]{.underline}. However, by building
scenarios --- based on an accurate assessment of Russian doctrine and
threat perceptions --- that simulate these types of challenges and
uncertainties in military exercises, Western military and political
decision makers can gain insights into what events Russia or the United
States might most easily misinterpret and what actions are most likely
to prompt a nuclear response. From these insights, policy makers and
defense planners can craft resilient operational deterrence policies
that better anticipate and mitigate the risks of unintended escalation.

In this way, military exercises and simulations can present unique
opportunities to strengthen operational resistance against accidental or
inadvertent escalation and to identify methods for reestablishing
operational deterrence should initial deterrence fail. By regularly
practicing operational procedures, nuclear support forces maintain a
high level of readiness and institutional proficiency, which reduces the
risk of accidents caused by human error. Moreover, regular exercises
provide an opportunity to safely stress test U.S.--NATO deterrence and
operational and declaratory policies against difficult scenarios that
reflect the realities of current geopolitical conditions. Measures to
strengthen adaptability could be easily incorporated into such exercises
by changing scenarios dynamically to reflect evolving global challenges.
By thinking through these scenarios and practicing them in a controlled
environment, U.S. and NATO military and political decision makers can
better identify weaknesses in current nuclear policy and outline
opportunities for restoring deterrence and managing nuclear escalation
should it begin.

In planning and conducting any nuclear-related exercises, it is
important that the [**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} carefully work to avoid [**[inadvertently
communicat]{.mark}ing** an [escalatory message]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Beatrice Heuser, Tormod Heier, and Guillaume Lasconjarias note that
[military [exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}, including nuclear exercises,
[[are]{.mark} often [an **important method** of]{.mark} **political
[communication]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, their [intended
[message]{.mark}]{.underline} may [**[easily]{.mark}** be
[misinterpreted by]{.mark} an opponent]{.underline}.107 Therefore, to
avoid unintended messaging, it is important that the United States and
NATO continually seek to improve their understanding of how
[[Russia]{.mark} **perceives** U.S./NATO nuclear exercises]{.underline}.
When carried out, nuclear-related exercises should adhere strictly to
nonescalatory political aims and always be accompanied by clear
communication and ongoing discussions between the United States/NATO and
Russia. Moreover, as suggested by James A. Blackwell, careful planning
of nuclear exercises to focus on broad and general nuclear training
rather than \[End Page 223\] specific scenarios or specific messaging
can also help to prevent or mitigate the negative effects of
misinterpreted messaging.108

## Cyberwar Good

### 1nc -- Cyberwar Good

#### Low-level attacks are stabilizing- no escalation

**Yoo, 17**---Emanuel S. Heller Professor of Law, University of
California, Berkeley, School of Law (John, "Embracing the Machines:
Rationalist War and New Weapons Technologies," 105 Calif. L. Rev. 443
(2017), dml)

[[New weapons tech]{.mark}nologies can help **[overcome]{.mark} the
obstacles** of [imperfect info]{.mark}rmation. Coercive measures can
**signal political will**, the **value placed** on the resources at
stake, or **military capabilities** that could **influence the outcome**
of a broader armed conflict. The **more costly the signal**, the **more
credible the information becomes**. A nation\'s leader can make a threat
of war and **send military forces** near disputed territory or a
potential conflict zone. Deployment **eats up resources** that would
**go to waste** if the nation is bluffing and incurs \"audience costs\"
domestically if the leader backs down]{.underline}.\"\' [**[Escalating
steps of force]{.mark}** will provide the opportunity to [**send more
precise signals** that]{.mark} gradually **consume more resources**,
**reveal more military capability**, and [**edge closer to war**. With
**more avenues to credibly signal**]{.mark} **capabilities**, there are
**more opportunities** to reveal **reliable**, **private information**,
and [the **likelihood of bluffing is reduced**]{.mark}. While [new
weapons]{.mark} technology may produce more opportunities for violence,
it [can **signal**]{.mark} **nations\' [capabilities]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} therey [[lead to **peace settlements rather
than war**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[**[Limiting the ability to deploy new]{.mark} weapons
[tech]{.mark}nologies [might make war more harmful]{.mark}**. A ban
[could **narrow the range of targets** and the **means of coercion** to
produce **more destructive signaling** and]{.mark} ultimately **[more
lethal conflicts]{.mark}**. One nation may want to send a signal during
a crisis that inflicts a **precise cost** on its opponent. [With a
**broader set of targets** and **more levels of harm**]{.mark}, the
nations [can send **more discrete signals**]{.mark} in the bargaining
process. [If nations **limit**]{.mark} **their signals** to conventional
attacks on military targets, [they will]{.mark} have to [employ **more
destructive levels**]{.mark} of force. They might develop even **more
devastating kinetic weapons** to produce the same effects]{.underline}
as the precision offered by cyber or robotic weapons. [[Limits on
new]{.mark} weapons [tech]{.mark}nology [might]{.mark} even
[**destabilize crises** by encouraging nations to **use offensive
weapons early**]{.mark} in a crisis because they might themselves be
vulnerable to attack]{.underline}. 15 4

[New weapons [tech]{.mark}nologies [can **more easily send specific
signals** that **advance the bargaining process** toward
settlement.]{.mark} **[Cyberweapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for example,
[can be used to **shut down** an opponent\'s financial markets or
transportation and communication networks for a limited
time]{.underline}. During the Kosovo War, the United States Air Force
achieved a similar result by dropping graphite on Belgrade\'s electrical
grid, which temporarily disabled power to Serbia\'s capital city. While
NATO claimed that the disruption in electricity undermined Serbian
military operations, the attack on the electricity grid also sought to
pressure Serbian civilians against supporting the Milosevic regime.15 5
While [such an attack]{.underline} would violate the ban on targeting
civilian objects set out in the Additional Protocol I of 1977 to the
Geneva Conventions, it can send a signal that [[may cause **less loss of
life**]{.mark} and **destruction** than an attack on a **hardened
military target using kinetic weapons**. Cyberweapons]{.underline}, in
particular, [present opportunities to [send a **more nuanced range of
signals**]{.mark} during interstate crises]{.underline}.\' 5 6 [Nations
can use cyberweapons to **attack each other\'s armed forces more
precisely**, [and hence **reduce**]{.mark} **direct
[casualties]{.mark}** to both military personnel and
civilians]{.underline}. In a contest over Taiwan, for example, China
could use cyberattacks to disable communications between the Pentagon
and the U.S. Seventh Fleet. These cyberattacks can inflict fewer, more
directed costs than kinetic attacks. [[Cyberweapons]{.mark}\' precision
can **[reduce collateral harm]{.mark}** to civilians by targeting **only
military communications**]{.underline}. While cyberattacks can cause
widespread harm, such as cutting water [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
electricity services to civilian populations, [they]{.underline} still
[[offer **more precise** and **controlled power** than kinetic
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}.

One might respond that some type of international regulation could
forestall long-term harms from cyber conflict that might outweigh the
benefits of credible signaling. Cyberweapons, for example, might also
make possible new types of harms that did not previously appear in
warfare, such as China\'s alleged theft of the U.S. personnel management
database or North Korea\'s entry into Sony\'s network. Or cyberwarfare
might open up a means for a faster escalation of hostilities. But even
if true, these costs have to compare to existing means of signaling,
which would depend on the use of conventional, kinetic weapons and their
accompanying destruction and loss of life. They would also have to
balance against the costs of cutting off a set of communications, which
might impede peaceful bargaining.

Even if nations could overcome informational asymmetry, the
international system\'s anarchy creates a second, more difficult,
obstacle to cooperation. While nations may understand that avoiding war
is mutually advantageous, they may not trust each other. The enforcement
problem is acute in situations where a settlement changes the status quo
between states, or where rapid changes are already affecting the balance
of power.\"\' One nation may find it difficult to trust the other to
keep a promise if the latter will become even more powerful as a result
of the agreement.

Information problems, for example, do not seem to explain the problems
with ending internal armed conflict or long wars. Internal armed
conflicts between a government and a rebel group often go on for
years-sixteen years, on average.15 8 Over the course of the war, both
sides acquire information about each other\'s goals, resources, and
will. Even with far more information than at the war\'s outset, the
parties often choose to fight rather than reach an agreement. This may
well be due to lack of enforcement mechanisms. A settlement may put one
of the two parties in a better position than when the fighting
continues. A rebel group may gain breathing space where it can regroup,
or the government may restore its authority in lost territory. One side
cannot be confident that the other will not take advantage of its new
position to break the agreement and take even more resources in the
following year.

A hypothetical territorial agreement between the United States and China
over Taiwan illustrates the difficulties of securing enforcement of a
settlement amidst a shifting balance of power. In the first time period,
the United States protects an independent iTaiwan. The United States has
a greater probability of prevailing in any conflict with China because
of its larger navy, air force, and forward bases in Korea, Japan, and
the Philippines. In the second time period, China\'s economy has boomed,
which translates into greater military power. China gains a higher
probability of winning in a war with the United States. In this period,
China and the United States agree to divide Taiwan in the middle
because, with full information, they both estimate their chances of
winning a war at fifty-fifty. China\'s gain of territory on Taiwan,
however, gives it a greater than 50 percent chance of prevailing in the
next time period because it now has a land base on the island itself.
China\'s prospects will also improve in the third time period because of
faster economic growth and military spending rates.

Under these conditions, the United States will have little confidence
that China will keep its agreement in the second time period. An
agreement will endow Beijing with an even greater advantage in future
time periods, which will encourage it to revise the division of Taiwan
further in its favor. China\'s conduct under its agreement with the
United Kingdom over Hong Kong illustrates the problem. In December 1984,
China achieved a superior military position relative to the United
Kingdom in any conflict over Hong Kong. In 1982, for example, China
spent \$49.5 billion on defense whereas the United Kingdom spent \$27.4
billion (they were the third and fourth largest spenders, respectively,
with the Soviet Union first at \$257 billion and the United States
second at \$196.3 billion). 59 But, much of the British military was
deployed in Europe as part of NATO, and China\'s proximity to Hong Kong
created a strategic advantage. To guarantee a peaceful transfer of
power, Beijing promised in an agreement with London that Hong Kong would
continue to enjoy an independent political system. Today, it appears
that China is reneging on this negotiated agreement; the Communist Party
has installed unpopular political leaders in Hong Kong to extend the
mainland\'s power over the territory. In the twenty-first century, the
United Kingdom has little military ability to prevent Beijing\'s
revision of the deal. The 1984 handover agreement could not withstand a
serious shift in the balance of power between China and the United
Kingdom.

[[Cyberwarfare]{.mark} might provide an unexpected way to [**increase
the ability**]{.mark} of nations [to **commit to**]{.mark} **the terms**
of [an agreement]{.mark}. In order to make a reliable agreement, a
nation has to be **willing to suffer a serious loss** if it fails to

that the cyber defense of the resource **could only be overcome** by
capabilities in the hands of the other nation. If one state violated its
international agreement, the other state could use cyber weapons to
destroy the resource. This [would be]{.mark} the **[twenty-first
century]{.mark} equivalent** of]{.underline} the ancient and medieval
practice of sending the children of aristocratic families to foreign
nations to serve as hostages, or the more recent concept of
**[[m]{.mark}utually [a]{.mark}ssured
[d]{.mark}estruction]{.underline}** during the Cold War. Due to the lack
of enforcement, however, states could never be certain that a nation
would not renege even on these guarantees-a nation could always remove
the vulnerabilities or suddenly deploy new defenses. But [these
**[expensive signals of commitment]{.mark}** could **[improve the
ability to cooperate]{.mark}** beyond matters as they stand
now]{.underline}.

A critic might argue that without international regulation of these new
technologies, the risk to civilians will increase. [Nations at
war]{.underline}, however, [will have an **incentive to distinguish
between military** and **civilian targets** to the extent allowed by the
capabilities of weapon systems. Rational nations should seek to
**contain the harms of war** in order to **maintain the conditions for
peace** and to **preserve the value of the civilian economy** in the
postwar period]{.underline}. 160 Defenders in a war do not want to kill
their fellow citizens or harm their own territory, although they might
destroy civilian property to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.
[Invaders will have **no interest in ruining the object of their
aggression**. Reducing civilian casualties may also **encourage an end
to conflict**]{.underline}. Targeting civilians and destroying
nonmilitary resources may harden nations at war and make a diplomatic
compromise more difficult. The unexpected carnage of World War I, for
example, made a peace agreement restoring the status quo to pre-August
1914 politically impossible for both the Allied and Central Powers.

Nations, moreover, have long pursued indirect coercion against civilian
populations in war. They have often turned to economic sanctions to
conduct hostilities short of direct armed conflict, or in conjunction
with active hostilities. In World Wars I and II, of course, the Allies
conducted economic warfare against Germany and its allies by levying a
blockade of both military and civilian shipping. 161 After the wars, the
UN Charter even expressed a preference for such tactics by authorizing
the Security Council to impose \"complete or partial interruption of
economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio,
and other means of communication\" in the case of a threat to
international peace and security.

While nations such as Great Britain and the United States have argued in
the past that embargos blocked only goods that might contribute to the
enemy military, this seems difficult to sustain in the case of the
complete embargoes that prevailed during the World Wars. Instead,
economic warfare serves the same objectives as the approach described
here for cyber and robotic weapons. First, [**[new cyber]{.mark}** and
**robotic [weapons]{.mark}** []{.mark}provide nations with a way to
**send [signal]{.mark}s** in international bargaining [through]{.mark}
the **[gradual escalation]{.mark} of coercion [short of outright
hostilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, [embargoes **[pressure
civilian populations to change the policies of their leaders]{.mark}**,
or even the **leaders themselves**]{.underline}. Perhaps [**cyber** and
**robotic weapons**, when employed as **steps in the escalation of
force**, will]{.underline} also [be understood as **more akin to
economic** than **kinetic warfare**]{.underline}.

A rationalist approach to war also provides an answer to the broader
critique of the new weapons technologies as facilitating war. Recall
that some UN officials and scholars share the concern that drones and
cyberweapons will encourage states to wage war more often. Critics argue
that these weapons remove a nation\'s soldiers from the battlefield,
theteby emboldening leaders to choose force more frequently. But,
[[understanding war as a bargaining failure **reveals the importance of
signaling**]{.mark} to resolving international disputes. New weapons
**create more opportunities for signaling**, which allows nations to
**communicate their intentions** and **capabilities more effectively**.
[Greater signaling should]{.mark} allow nations to **share more
information**, which on the margins will [lead to **more international
deals** and]{.mark} therefore an **overall [reduction of major
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ironically, [an effort to ban new weapons
**may well produce more war**, **not less**.]{.underline}

#### Chinese Turn -- They're dependence on cyberweapons [gives the US an advantage]{.underline} because we're [better at shutting down their systems]{.underline} than [they are]{.underline} at [targeting ours]{.underline}. Having cyber options give them [false confidence]{.underline} and [decreases their emphasis]{.underline} on [conventional capabilities]{.underline}.

1 Introduction Information technology is the nervous system of the
global economy. Critical infrastructure for banking, power,
transportation, and industry increasingly depends on embedded computers
connected to the internet. Firms and citizens entrust vital personal,
medical, and financial data to distant servers in return for more
convenient and efficient services. Military command and control relies
on digital networks to connect far-flung surveillance and strike systems
and to project power rapidly and precisely. Yet this vital
interconnectivity also facilitates new modes of crime, protest,
espionage, and warfare. Ubiquitous computer networks both provide access
to valuable targets and become targets themselves. Protecting and
influencing cyber infrastructure has thus become a major priority for
governments and other political actors around the world. [[The]{.mark}
very [ubiquity of info]{.mark}rmation [technology makes]{.mark} the
danger of [cyber]{.mark} threats **[easy to
exaggerate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In contemporary defense policy
discourse there are three influential narratives of mounting cyber
peril. [The most dangerous envisions the paralysis of industrial control
systems of military command and control through **surprise attack by
anonymous hackers**]{.underline}. This scenario is [often described as
[a **"digital Pearl Harbor" or**]{.mark} **a ["cyber
9/11"]{.mark}**]{.underline} depending on whether the imagined aggressor
is a revisionist state like China or Iran or a non-state anarchist or
terrorist empowered by the information revolution. [A second narrative
offers an alternative to the shock of sudden catastrophe by warning of
the long term erosion of economic and military
competitiveness]{.underline}. The relentless theft of vital secrets
stored on corporate and government networks is thus [thought to cause a
prolonged "death by a thousand cuts." In both of these scenarios, weaker
states and terrorists gain increasing access to powerful hacking tools
while technology-dependent advanced industrial states become
increasingly vulnerable to cyber attack and exploitation.]{.underline} 1
A third category of threat narrative concerns the transformation of
internet architecture to decisively benefit one political group at the
expense of the other. At one extreme, the growth of flexible social
media enables connected protesters to overwhelm and overthrow
authoritarian regimes.2 At the other extreme governments censor and
reconfigure the internet to undermine innovation and freedom. State
paranoia about paralysis and erosion thus leads to digital lockout or
"the end of the internet" as we know it.3 **[National security
officials]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline} **[defense
industry]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} media
**[pundits]{.underline}** [all have **incentives to
exaggerate**]{.underline} the cyber threat.4 [The **[secrecy]{.mark}**
of cyber operations further [complicates
assessment]{.mark}]{.underline}, even as states make major investments
in cyber defense. [Each [of the]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}three
[[narratives]{.mark} above]{.underline} **[are indeed
[exaggerations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [but they **point toward more
plausible scenarios**]{.underline} [using cyber operations as **subtle
complements to**]{.underline} or even substitutes for more
[traditional]{.underline} forms of [aggression]{.underline}.
Understanding the dynamics, magnitude, and likelihood of aggression
online requires greater attention to the operational requirements for
staging various types of cyber operations, the strategic benefits actors
hope to gain through them, and the risks of unintended consequences.
[Too often [defenders]{.mark} of the cyber revolution [focus]{.mark}
narrowly [on the **tech**]{.mark}**nological possibility**]{.underline}
[for harm [but discount]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[operational and
institutional obstacles]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to effectiveness [and
ignore the **strategic utility of cyber harm**]{.mark}]{.underline} or
threats of harm. 5 [A realistic appraisal]{.underline} of cyber threats
[must take not only **technological** but also **strategic logic** into
account]{.underline}. Thomas Schelling distinguishes brute force, which
is needed in a contest of strength, from coercive threats, which are
useful in a contest of resolve.6 Both require the power to inflict harm,
but brute force exercises it while coercion holds (at least some of) it
in reserve. Likewise, actors might use cyber operations to attempt to
change the balance of power directly or they might use them to provide
information about their intentions and commitment. To paraphrase
Clausewitz, [[cyberwar is **politics**]{.mark} **by other
means**]{.underline}. [As a result of technical and political
constraints, the coercive potential of cyberspace is]{.underline} more
limited than generally appreciated, but it is not negligible, especially
when exploited in conjunction with other forms power such as military
force. In this chapter we lay out a typology of cyber operations,
distinguishing the skills and resources needed to cause different types
of harm. [Not all cyber options are equally available to all actors
because of varying requirements in organizational capacity, intelligence
support, and risk sensitivity]{.underline}. For each of the exaggerated
myths mentioned above, [there are **low-cost, low- payoff irritants
widely available**]{.underline} [as well as
**higher-cost**,]{.underline} potentially **[higher-payoff adjunct
capabilities]{.underline}** [available to a more restricted set of
predominantly **nation-state actors**]{.underline}. Next we evaluate the
coercive utility of these various harms, or threats of these harms, by
taking into consideration the interaction of cyberspace with other
domains. Finally we ask, what types of cyber coercion are most likely?
We argue that there exist two important bounds on the distribution of
cyber harm. First, because voluntary connections to the internet make
cyber harms possible in the first place, aggressors must be careful not
to provoke their victims to disconnect. Second, the availability of
military instruments beyond the cyber domain, creates potential for
retaliation for unacceptable harms. These constraints combine to make
small-scale cyber aggression relatively appealing and thus more likely
while making large-scale aggression difficult and undesirable for
initiators and thus less likely. [The finding of [this chapter
extends]{.mark} the logic of [the **stability-instability
paradox**]{.mark}]{.underline} pioneered in the 1960s. [While nuclear
weapons can deter nuclear war, they can fail to deter, and even
**encourage**]{.underline}, conventional or **[peripheral
war.]{.underline}** [[M]{.mark}utually [a]{.mark}ssured
[d]{.mark}estruction [restrained]{.mark} the superpowers from engaging
in **[direct confrontations]{.mark}**]{.underline} during the Cold War,
[even as this restraint **encouraged and facilitated the exercise of
proxy wars**]{.underline} throughout the Third World. [The mechanisms of
restraint [in]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} domain are slightly
different]{.underline} than in the nuclear world---the risk of voluntary
disconnection and military retaliation vs. mutual Armageddon---[but [the
results are similar: **little**]{.mark} **truly [dangerous behavior and
a lot of provocative friction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The social and
economic value of the internet **expands the scope for minor
aggression**]{.underline} [like]{.underline} **[espionage, covert
influence, and symbolic protest]{.underline}**. [Cyber operations also
act as valuable adjuncts for battlefield operations]{.underline} akin to
signals intelligence and electronic warfare for states who are willing
and able to go to war for other reasons. [However, [there are
**diminishing incentives to "go big"**]{.mark} **with cyber warfare
alone**]{.underline} [given the incentives targets have to identify even
a hard-to-identify attacker and shift domains to punish cyber
aggression. Although the attribution of the attacker's identity is
widely thought to be hard problem in cyberspace, ano[nymity is **never
guaranteed**]{.mark}]{.underline} and might not even be useful for some
forms of coercion. [A]{.underline} [**[nonzero risk of
attribution]{.underline}** [opens the door to **retaliatory
punishment**]{.underline}, [which encourages]{.underline}]{.mark}
[attackers to exercise **[restraint]{.mark} in cyber
aggression**]{.underline}. [Ironically enough, **the [instability we
perceive]{.mark} in cyberspace [is indicative of the stability of
deterrence of]{.mark} the most [dangerous cyber
threats]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[Barring]{.underline} **[gross misperception]{.underline}**, however,
[[one can expect]{.mark} the [**risk** of **unwanted
escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline} from cyber to other military domains
[[to]{.underline} **[deter]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[both]{.underline}**
sides [from]{.underline} resorting to [more destructive forms of
computer network attack in most situations]{.underline}. 113 Yet
[although nuclear or [conventional deterrence]{.mark} might be able to
check catastrophic cyberattack]{.underline}, [it]{.underline} **[[cannot
credibly discourage minor]{.mark} cyber
[aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}** such as nationalist hacktivism,
industrial espionage, or harassment of dissident expatriates. [Indeed,
the observable pattern of Chinese (and American) [cyber]{.mark} activity
[conforms to the]{.mark} logic of the **Cold War [stability-instability
paradox]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but in slightly revised form. In the
original formulation of the paradox, mutual vulnerability to nuclear
retaliation inhibits nuclear war but encourages conventional war in
peripheral theaters where nuclear threats are not credible.114 Today,
[the intensity of cyber aggression is bounded by the risk of any form of
military retaliation]{.underline} as well as the need to preserve
interconnection and protect sources and methods that rely on deception.
Cyberattackers intentionally keep the costs they inflict below the
assessed threshold of even limited military retaliation by opponents,
occupying a region where military threats of punishment would be utterly
noncredible. The aggressor's freedom of action is further constrained by
the need to maintain stealth and plausible deniability for ongoing
operations. Actors that are deterred by threats of military punishment,
on the one hand, and threats of counterintelligence detection or loss of
connection, on the other, are encouraged to find more limited ways to
inflict costs. [The complexity of modern]{.underline} computer network
[infrastructure]{.underline}, in particular, [offers]{.underline} many
**[inexpensive ways]{.underline}** [to inflict minor costs. One
implication is that cyberspace creates more scope for nontraditional
security concerns]{.underline} (e.g., harassment of human rights
organizations and vulnerable user communities) that powerful actors
usually ignore in their focus on protecting high-value economic and
military assets.115 [As long as]{.underline} dense interconnection and
economic [interdependence remain]{.underline} mutually beneficial
[for]{.underline} powers such as [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and China]{.mark}, they [will]{.mark} be able to **[tolerate]{.mark}
the [irritants that they]{.mark} will [inevitably inflict]{.mark} on one
another**]{.underline}. The modern intelligence-counterintelligence
contest plays out in a complicated sociotechnical space where states
take advantage of economic cooperation and hedge against security
competition. If their broader mutual interest frays, however, then
cyberwarfare becomes just one facet of a more serious strategic problem
involving more dangerous means. Exaggeration of the cyber threat feeds
spirals of mistrust, which make this undesirable outcome slightly more
likely. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
China]{.mark}]{.underline} should discuss the interaction of
cybersecurity and traditional military force in depth and take steps to
limit misunderstandings about the other's intentions. They
[[might]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[learn to **interpret chronic cyber
friction**]{.underline} [as a **sign that**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[more
truly [dangerous threats have been constrained]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Contrary to conventional wisdom, the emergence of complex [cyber
threats may be a **positive development**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
tragic history of international politics: the **[[bad news about
cybersecurity is good news for global security]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### 2nc -- Reduces War

#### Cyberwar reduces physical war

Thomas **Rid 13**, THOMAS RID is a Reader in War Studies at King's
College London, 12-1-2013, \"Cyberwar and Peace,\" Foreign Affairs,

Cyberwar Is Coming!" declared the title of a seminal 1993 article by the
RAND Corporation analysts John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, who argued
that the nascent Internet would fundamentally transform warfare. The
idea seemed fanciful at the time, and it took more than a decade for
members of the U.S. national security establishment to catch on. But
once they did, a chorus of voices resounded in the mass media,
proclaiming the dawn of the era of cyberwar and warning of its
terrifying potential. In February 2011, then CIA Director [Leon Panetta
warned]{.underline} Congress that "[the **next Pearl Harbor could very
well be a cyberattack**]{.underline}." And in late 2012, Mike
[McConnell]{.underline}, who had served as director of national
intelligence under President George W. Bush, [warned]{.underline} darkly
[that the United States could not "wait for the cyber equivalent of the
collapse of the World Trade Centers]{.underline}." [Yet the
**[hype]{.mark}**]{.underline} about everything "cyber" [has
[obscured]{.mark}]{.underline} three [**[basic truths:]{.underline}**
[cyberwar has **never happened**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the past, [it
is **not occurring**]{.underline} in the present, [and it is **highly
unlikely**]{.underline} [that it will disturb the future]{.underline}.
Indeed, rather than heralding a new era of violent conflict, [[so
far]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark}-era [has been defined by]{.mark} **the
opposite trend: [a computer-enabled assault on]{.mark} political
[violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[diminish]{.underline}]{.mark}** rather than accentuate **[political
[violence]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[by making it easier]{.mark} for
states, groups, and individuals [to **engage in**]{.mark} **two kinds of
[aggression that do not rise to]{.mark} the level of [war]{.mark}:
sabotage and espionage**]{.underline}. [Weaponized computer code and
computer-based sabotage operations make it possible to carry out highly
targeted attacks on an adversary's technical systems **without directly
and physically harming human operators and managers**]{.underline}.
Computer-assisted attacks make it possible to steal data without placing
operatives in dangerous environments, [[thus **reducing**]{.mark} **the
level of**]{.underline} personal and political
**[[risk]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These developments represent important
changes in the nature of political violence, but they also highlight
[limitations inherent in cyberweapons]{.underline} that **[greatly
curtail the utility of cyberattacks]{.underline}**. Those limitations
seem to make it difficult to use cyberweapons for anything other than
one-off, hard-to-repeat sabotage operations of questionable strategic
value that might even prove counterproductive. And cyber-espionage often
requires improving traditional spycraft techniques and relying even more
heavily on human intelligence. Taken together, these factors call into
question the very idea that computer-assisted attacks will usher in a
profoundly new era. THE THIN CASE FOR CYBERWAR One reason discussions
about cyberwar have become disconnected from reality is that many
commentators fail to grapple with a basic question: What counts as
warfare? Carl von Clausewitz, the nineteenth-century Prussian military
theorist, still offers the most concise answer to that question.
Clausewitz identified three main criteria that any aggressive or
defensive action must meet in order to qualify as an act of war. First,
and most simply, all acts of war are violent or potentially violent.
Second, an act of war is always instrumental: physical violence or the
threat of force is a means to compel the enemy to accept the attacker's
will. Finally, to qualify as an act of war, an attack must have some
kind of political goal or intention. For that reason, acts of war must
be attributable to one side at some point during a confrontation. No
known cyberattack has met all three of those criteria; indeed, very few
have met even one. Consider three incidents that today's Cassandras
frequently point to as evidence that warfare has entered a new era. The
first of these, a massive pipeline explosion in the Soviet Union in June
1982, would count as the most violent cyberattack to date \-- if it
actually happened. According to a 2004 book by Thomas Reed, who was
serving as a staffer on the U.S. National Security Council at the time
of the alleged incident, a covert U.S. operation used rigged software to
engineer a massive explosion in the Urengoy-Surgut-Chelyabinsk pipeline,
which connected Siberian natural gas fields to Europe. Reed claims that
the CIA managed to insert malicious code into the software that
controlled the pipeline's pumps and valves. The rigged valves supposedly
resulted in an explosion that, according to Reed, the U.S. Air Force
rated at three kilotons, equivalent to the force of a small nuclear
device. But aside from Reed's account, there is hardly any evidence to
prove that any such thing happened, and plenty of reasons to doubt that
it did. After Reed published his book, Vasily Pchelintsev, who was
reportedly the KGB head of the region when the explosion was supposed to
have taken place, denied the story. He surmised that Reed might have
been referring to a harmless explosion that happened not in June but on
a warm April day that year, caused by pipes shifting in the thawing
ground of the tundra. Moreover, no Soviet media reports from 1982
confirm that Reed's explosion took place, although the Soviet media
regularly reported on accidents and pipeline explosions at the time.
What's more, given the technologies available to the United States at
that time, it would have been very difficult to hide malicious software
of the kind Reed describes from its Soviet users. Another incident often
related by promoters of the concept of cyberwar occurred in Estonia in
2007. After Estonian authorities decided to move a Soviet-era memorial
to Russian soldiers who died in World War II from the center of Tallinn
to the city's outskirts, outraged Russian-speaking Estonians launched
violent riots that threatened to paralyze the city. The riots were
accompanied by cyber-assaults, which began as crude disruptions but
became more sophisticated after a few days, culminating in a "denial of
service" attack. Hackers hijacked up to 85,000 computers and used them
to overwhelm 58 Estonian websites, including that of the country's
largest bank, which the attacks rendered useless for a few hours.
Estonia's defense minister and the country's top diplomat pointed their
fingers at the Kremlin, but they were unable to muster any evidence. For
its part, the Russian government denied any involvement. In the wake of
the incident, Estonia's prime minister, Andrus Ansip, likened the attack
to an act of war. "What's the difference between a blockade of harbors
or airports of sovereign states and the blockade of government
institutions and newspaper websites?" he asked. It was a rhetorical
question, but the answer is important: unlike a naval blockade, the
disruption of websites is not violent \-- indeed, not even potentially
violent. The choice of targets also seemed unconnected to the presumed
tactical objective of forcing the government to reverse its decision on
the memorial. And unlike a naval blockade, the attacks remained
anonymous, without political backing, and thus unattributable. A year
later, a third major event entered the cyber-Cassandras' repertoire. In
August 2008, the Georgian army attacked separatists in the province of
South Ossetia. Russia backed the separatists and responded militarily.
The prior month, in what might have been the first time that an
independent cyberattack was launched in coordination with a conventional
military operation, unknown attackers had begun a campaign of
cyber-sabotage, defacing prominent Georgian websites, including those of
the country's national bank and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and
launching denial-of-service attacks against the websites of Georgia's
parliament, its largest commercial bank, and Georgian news outlets. The
Georgian government blamed the Kremlin, just as the Estonians had done.
But Russia again denied sponsoring the attacks, and a NATO investigation
later found "no conclusive proof" of who had carried them out. The
attack set off increasingly familiar alarm bells within American media
and the U.S. national security establishment. "The July attack may have
been a dress rehearsal for an all-out cyberwar," an article in The New
York Times declared. Richard Clarke, a former White House cybersecurity
czar, warned that the worst was yet to come: the Georgian attack did not
"begin to reveal what the Russian military and intelligence agencies
could do if they were truly on the attack in cyberspace." Yet the actual
effects of these nonviolent events were quite mild. The main damage they
caused was to the Georgian government's ability to communicate
internationally, thus preventing it from getting out its message at a
critical moment. But even if the attackers intended this effect, it
proved short-lived: within four days after military confrontations had
begun in earnest, the Georgian Foreign Ministry had set up an account on

grenade. IN CODE WE TRUST? Perhaps the strongest evidence presented by
advocates of the concept of cyberwar is the Stuxnet operation launched
against Iran by the United States and Israel. Stuxnet, part of a set of
attacks known as Operation Olympic Games, was a sophisticated multiyear
campaign to sabotage Iran's nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz by
inserting a harmful computer worm into the software that ran the
facility's centrifuges, causing them to overload. American and Israeli
developers started designing the project as early as 2005, and it
launched in 2007, growing more sophisticated until its discovery in
2010. The attack was groundbreaking in several ways. The developers
built highly target-specific intelligence into the code, enabling the
Stuxnet software to make autonomous decisions in its target environment.
Most important, Stuxnet represented the first and only physically
destructive cyberattack launched by one state (or, in this case, two
states) against another. Yet even [cyberattacks that cause damage do so
only **indirectly**]{.underline}. As an agent of violence, [[computer
code]{.mark} faces a very basic limit: it **[does not have its own
force]{.mark} or energy**]{.underline}. Instead, [any cyberattack with
the goal of material destruction or harming human life must utilize the
force or energy **embedded in its target**]{.underline}: for example,
shutting down an air traffic control system and causing trains or planes
to crash or disrupting a power plant and sparking an explosion. Yet
besides Stuxnet, [there is no proof that **anyone has ever successfully
launched a major attack of this sort**]{.underline}. [[Lethal
cyberattacks]{.mark}, while certainly possible, [remain]{.mark} the
**stuff of [fiction]{.mark}**]{.underline}: none has ever killed or even
injured a single human being. [Thanks to its lack of direct physical
impact, code-induced violence also has **less emotional
impact**]{.underline}. [It would be difficult for a cyberattack to
produce]{.underline} the level of **[fear]{.underline}** [that
coordinated]{.underline} campaigns of [terrorism]{.underline} or
conventional military operations [produce]{.underline}. Owing to their
invisibility, [[cyberweapons also lack]{.mark} the **[symbolic
power]{.mark}** of traditional ones]{.underline}. Displays of weaponry,
such as the elaborate military parades put on by China and North Korea,
sometimes represent nothing more than nationalist pageantry. But
revealing one's arsenal can also serve tactical and strategic ends, as
when countries deploy aircraft carriers to demonstrate their readiness
to use force or carry out operations designed to intimidate the enemy,
such as using military aircraft to conduct deliberately low flyovers.
Indeed, displaying weapons systems and threatening to use them can prove
more cost-efficient than their actual use. But cyberweapons are hard to
brandish. Perhaps the most crucial limitation of violence in cyberspace
is its almost entirely destructive quality: unlike traditional political
violence, which can maintain trust in institutions and states as well as
undermine it, violence in cyberspace can do only the latter. Any
established political order comes with a certain degree of inherent
violence; consolidated states, after all, survive only if they maintain
monopolies on the legitimate use of force. By encouraging trust in the
ability of state institutions to protect property and safeguard
citizens, this inherent violence buttresses a state's power and allows
the state to establish the rule of law. But cyber-violence lacks this
ability, since it does little or nothing to build up trust in
institutions; indeed, it is very difficult to imagine how cyberattacks
could be used to enforce rules or laws, either domestically or
internationally. Digital surveillance presents a more complicated
picture. In democracies, intelligence agencies tread a thin line between
providing security and eroding public trust in the state, as
demonstrated by the recent controversy over the U.S. National Security
Agency's data-collection practices. In authoritarian countries, digital
surveillance can assist the state's coercive use of force, but it cannot
replace it. Such limitations, however, should not lead anyone to dismiss
the corrosive potential of cyberattacks. Indeed, such assaults can
undermine social trust in a more direct way than traditional political
violence. Cyberattacks are more precise; they do not necessarily
undermine the state's monopoly of force in a wholesale fashion. Instead,
they can be tailored to attack specific companies or public-sector
organizations and used to undermine those groups' authority selectively.
Stuxnet provides a good example of this dynamic. Putting aside the
question of whether the attack was an act of war, its primary intention
was to undermine the trust of the Iranian scientists in their systems
and in themselves and the trust of the Iranian regime in its ability to
build nuclear weapons. The original intention was to cause physical
damage to as many Iranian centrifuges as possible. But the American and
Israeli attackers knew that the physical effect could be exploited to
unleash a much more damaging psychological effect. "The intent was that
the failures should make them feel they were stupid, which is what
happened," an American participant told The New York Times. The
Americans and the Israelis hoped that once a few machines failed, the
Iranian engineers would shut down more machines because they distrusted
their own technology or indeed their own skills. At the headquarters of
the International Atomic Energy Agency, in Vienna, rumors circulated
that the Iranians had lost so much confidence in their own systems and
instruments that the management of the Natanz facility took the
extraordinary step of assigning engineers to sit in the plant and radio
back what they saw to confirm the instrument readings. "They
overreacted," one of the attackers revealed to David Sanger of The New
York Times, "and that delayed them even more." The Iranians also began
to assign blame internally, pointing fingers at one another and even
firing some personnel. DIGITAL UNDERGROUND Damaging though it may have
been, Stuxnet, along with the cyber-scuffles in Estonia and Georgia,
represents not a new form of warfare but something more akin to other,
less lethal forms of aggression: sabotage and espionage. Unlike acts of
war, these political crimes, which are often committed by nonstate
actors, need not be violent to work. And although saboteurs and spies do
act politically, they often seek to avoid attribution, unlike those who
launch acts of war. For those reasons, the cyber-era has been a boon for
political crime. Consider sabotage. Before the computer age, saboteurs
had trouble calibrating and controlling the effects of their actions.
Sabotage had to target physical property and relied on physical
violence, which often proves unpredictable. During postal and railway
strikes in France in 1909 and 1910, for instance, saboteurs cut signal
wires and tore down telegraph posts. Destroying property risked running
afoul of public opinion, and the tactic ultimately divided the workers.
The strikes themselves, as a form of sabotage, also ran the risk of
leading to unpredictable violence: indeed, labor demonstrations often
intensified into riots, making it easier for opponents to portray the
strikers as uncompromising radicals. It is much easier for saboteurs to
avoid counterproductive side effects in the age of computer-assisted
attacks, which can contain violence and generally avoid it altogether.
Cyberattacks can maliciously affect software and business processes
without interfering with physical industrial processes, remaining
nonviolent but sometimes still causing greater damage than a traditional
assault. A 2012 attack against the computer network of the oil company
Saudi Aramco illustrates this potential. The attack physically harmed
neither hardware nor humans. Yet by allegedly erasing the hard disks of
some 30,000 computers, the attackers likely did much more monetary
damage to Saudi Aramco than they could have through an act of
traditional sabotage against machinery in one of the company's plants.
The oil giant reportedly had to hire six specialized computer security
firms to help with its forensic investigation and post-attack cleanup.
Despite such potential, it is also important to remember the inherent
limitations of computer-assisted political crime and to note that human
agents remain critical in the age of digital violence. Even Stuxnet, the
most successful example of cyber-sabotage, demonstrates this fact. For
the United States and Israel, the "holy grail," in the words of one of
the attack's architects, was getting a piece of malicious software into
the control system at Natanz. The Americans and Israelis needed
fine-grained data from inside the Iranian plant to develop their
weaponized code. The problem was that the control system was protected
by an air gap: it was not connected to the Internet or even internal
networks. As a result, the attackers had to deliver the malicious code
via a removable hard drive such as a USB flash drive \-- delivered by a
human hand. To make this happen, U.S. intelligence operatives first
obtained a list of the people who were visiting the targeted plant to
work on its computer equipment and who could carry the payload there.
"We had to find an unwitting person on the Iranian side of the house who
could jump the gap," one planner later told Sanger. The list of possible
carriers included engineers from the German company Siemens, who were
helping their Iranian colleagues maintain the control system \-- work
that required the Siemens engineers to bring portable computers into the
plant. Precisely how the U.S.-Israeli team managed to exploit this
vulnerability remains unknown. Suffice it to say that although "Siemens
had no idea they were a carrier," in the words of one U.S. official
quoted by Sanger, "it turns out there is always an idiot around who
doesn't think much about the thumb drive in their hand." SAFETY IN ONES
AND ZEROS [[If cyberattacks **reduce**]{.mark} **the amount of
[violence]{.mark} inherent in conflict**, and if they often take the

Instead, [we question the idea that nations should look to]{.underline}
formal treaties and **[rules]{.underline}** [to produce **lasting limits
on war**]{.underline}. Despite the recent deterioration in the Syrian
civil war, [nation-states have generally **refrained** from the use of
**chemical weapons**]{.underline} against each other since the end of
World War I. They have followed the Geneva Conventions on prisoners of
war, though not consistently. [Nations have observed other
**norms**]{.underline} in the breach, chief among them the immunity of
the civilian population and resources from attack. World War Il not only
saw the aerial bombing of cities and the nuclear attacks on Japan, but
the years since have seen precision targeting of terrorists off the
battlefield, attacks on urban infrastructure, and the acceptance of high
levels of collateral damage among civilians. International lawyers and
diplomats may proclaim that nations follow universal rules, either
because of morality or a sense of legal obligation, but the record of
practice tells a far different story. [Efforts to impose more
**specific** and **demanding rules**, such as **limiting**]{.underline}
targeted drone attacks, banning **[cyber attacks]{.underline}**, or
requiring human control of robotic weapons, [will similarly fail because
they cannot take into account **unforeseen circumstances**,]{.underline}
[new **weapons** and **military situations**, and the immediate
**exigencies** of war]{.underline}. Just as new technology led to
increases in economic productivity, so too has it allowed nations to
make war more effectively. [Nations will readily **adhere** to
humanitarian standards when they gain a **benefit** that **outweighs the
cost**]{.underline}, as when protecting enemy prisoners of war secures
reciprocal protection for a nation\'s own soldiers taken captive by the
enemy. [Limitations on the use of weapons will follow a **similar
logic**]{.underline}. Nations will be most inclined to respect legal
restraints on new weapons when their use by both sides would leave no
one better off or would provide little advantage.
**[Cyber]{.underline}** and robotic **[weapons]{.underline}** [do not
bear the same features as the weapons where legal bans have
**succeeded**]{.underline}, as with use of poison gas on the
battlefield. **[Cyber]{.underline}** and robotic
**[weapons]{.underline}** [need not inflict unnecessary suffering out
**of proportion** to their military advantages]{.underline}, as do
poisoned bullets or blinding lasers. [Rather, these weapons improve the
**precision of force** and thereby **reduce human death** and
**destruction** in war. **Nor**]{.underline} have [these new weapons
technologies yet sparked a **useless arms race**]{.underline}. [Nuclear
weapons eventually became opportune for arms control because larger
stockpiles provided marginal, if any, benefits due to the destructive
potential of each weapon and the deterrence provided by even a modest
arsenal]{.underline}. Mutual reductions could leave both sides in the
same position as they were before the agreement. Today, the marginal
cost of nuclear weapons for the U.S. and Russia so outweighs their
marginal benefit that it is not even clear that a binding international
agreement is needed to reduce their arsenals. Russia, for example,
reduced its arsenal below New START\'s ceilings of 1,550 nuclear
warheads and 700 strategic launchers even before the U.S. approved the
deal. 45 The United States likely would have reduced its forces to those
levels even if the Senate had refused to consent to the treaty, a
position the executive branch also took in 2002 with the Treaty of
Moscow\'s deep reduction in nuclear weapons. [Today\'s new weapons do
not yet bear these characteristics. The **marginal gains** in deploying
these weapons will likely be asymmetric across nations insofar as some
nations will experience **much greater gains** in **military
capability** by developing **cyber**]{.underline} and drone
**[technology]{.underline}**. Put differently, [**prohibition** or
**regulation** of these new weapons will not have **equal impacts on
rival nations**.]{.underline} Indeed, we do not even now have enough
information to understand which nations will benefit and which will not,
which makes any form of international ban even less likely.

Military Threats of Cyberwarfare Just as the social context of
exploitation and adversary counteraction combine to blunt the potential
of cyber espionage, similar [[challenges in]{.mark} operational
[weaponization]{.mark} and strategic interaction **[constrain]{.mark}
the [potency of]{.mark}**]{.underline} more **[disruptive [cyber]{.mark}
threats]{.underline}**. Yet [conventional wisdom holds that a multitude
of technical factors favor offense over defense in
cyberspace]{.underline} and that the difªculty of attribution undermines
the credibility of deterrence; therefore, weaker actors can attack the
control systems of superior adversaries to achieve levels of physical
disruption possible previously only through kinetic bombing. As
President Obama writes in a Wall Street Journal opinion article,
"Computer systems in critical sectors of our economy---including the
nuclear and chemical industries---are being increasingly targeted. . . .
In a future conºict, an adversary unable to match our military supremacy
on the battleªeld might seek to exploit our computer vulnerabilities
here at home. Taking down vital banking systems could trigger a ªnancial
crisis. The lack of clean water or functioning hospitals could spark a
public health emergency. And as we've seen in past blackouts, the loss
of electricity can bring businesses, cities and entire regions to a
standstill."74 A number of former U.S. government ofªcials have even
likened the advent of cyberweapons to a new atomic age and have wondered
why a catastrophic cyberattack has not yet occurred.75 [Chinese military
doctrine similarly envisions cyberwarfare to be a low-cost, long-range,
highly effective]{.underline} counter to a superior adversary.76 [[There
are **reasons**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, **[[to doubt the PLA's
ability to implement]{.mark} these [ideas]{.mark}]{.underline}** [or to
**defend itself**]{.underline} against cyberattacks launched by a
superior adversary. chinese cyber doctrine [The aggressive tenor of
Chinese writings]{.underline} on cyberwarfare and the copious APT
activity described above [are the major sources of evidence that Western
analysts usually offer to characterize the Chinese cyberwarfare
threat]{.underline}. Ofªcial Chinese military [doctrine]{.underline} and
sources in Chinese military professional literature [consistently
describe cyberwarfare as a revolutionary development]{.underline} in
military affairs. Senior Col. Ye Zheng, author of books published by the
Chinese Academy of Military Science entitled On Informationalized
Warfare and Information Warfare Course, writes, "Although the main
melody of the times---peace and development---is still playing strongly,
the dark spirit of network warfare is lurking in the sky above
humanity." This rhetorical construction implies that the cyber
revolution undermines Deng Xiaoping's diagnosis of the largely stable
nature of the international environment. Ye singles out the United
States for experimenting with cyberweapons such as Stuxnet (used in the
attack on Iranian enrichment infrastructure) and hints at the prospect
of more to come: "\[J\]ust as nuclear war was the strategic warfare of
the industrial age, network warfare will be the strategic warfare of the
information age. It has already become a 'top level' form of operation
that is highly destructive and relates to national security and
survival."77 He further describes cyberwarfare as an integral force
multiplier as well as an instrument for achieving more strategic effects
such as paralyzing another state's economy or exerting psychological
inºuence on entire populations. Similarly, an author in the PLA's
Science of Information Operations writes that cyber strikes "can seek to
achieve partial or large-scale paralysis of enemy systems. As soon as a
virus enters the enemy's command and control system, it will have
tremendous destructive impact. . . . Therefore computer network war is
an important means for paralyzing the enemy in wars of the future."78
The PLA recognizes the existence of an "information domain" (xinxi
lingyu), although as with "information security" it encompasses a wider
range of subcategories to include computer network and electronic
warfare as well as psychological and intelligence operations.79
Information operations are con-sidered so vital for the limited
high-technology wars the PLA envisions ªghting that information
supremacy is thought to be a precondition for gaining military supremacy
anywhere else. The PLA's general strategic principle of "active defense"
stresses offensive operations to seize the initiative. The authoritative
Science of Campaigns thus states that the beginning of a network war
will determine its outcome: "Whoever strikes ªrst prevails."80 PLA
strategists assert that the vital targets of an advanced technology
adversary are its information systems, and by attacking them covertly
from beyond the range of enemy weapon systems it is possible to cause
paralysis of the enemy's organization, strategic decisionmaking, and
national economy. As an important article by Gen. Dai Qingmin on the
concept of "integrated network-electronic warfare" points out,
"Information operations in high-tech warfare are, to a very great
extent, a struggle which revolves around the destruction and the
protection of C4ISR systems."81 [[Chinese writers argue]{.mark} that
[a]{.mark} relatively [weaker PLA can achieve **info**]{.mark}**rmation
[superiority]{.mark} against a stronger military**]{.underline} only as
long as it is able to launch paralyzing strikes at the beginning of a
conºict. [The Chinese perspective]{.underline} on using information
technology to improve awareness, synchronization, and precision [is
[inspired by **1990s**]{.mark}**-era [American
writings]{.mark}**]{.underline} about the "revolution in military
affairs \[RMA\]."82 RMA ideas were themselves inspired by Soviet
strategists, and the common Marxist-Leninist belief that "technology
determines tactics" surely inºuences PLA thought.83 Yet the most recent
and relevant inspiration comes from Chinese study of U.S. operations in
Iraq and the Balkans and analysis of the U.S. military's heavy
dependence on communication and logistics networks.84 In particular, the
accidental U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade prompted
President Jiang Zemin to direct the PLA to develop so-called assassin's
mace (shashoujian) weapons to solve the problems of "seeing far,
striking far, and striking accurately." Jiang reasoned that "what the
enemy is most fearful of is what we should be developing."85 As the
consummately "network centric" U.S. military leverages data links to
reduce its force size---substituting information for mass in the
RMAformula for success---those links become vulnerabilities and thus
tempting targets for the PLA. [Insofar as the cyber
revolution]{.underline} [thesis is]{.underline} inºuential [in U.S.
strategic planning, moreover, the specter of PLA cyberwarfare may indeed
**have some success in creating fear and encouraging restraint in U.S.
planning.** Remarkably, however, [there appears to be **little
mention**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Chinese writings **[[of the]{.mark}
considerable controversy over]{.underline}** the **[RMA in Western
strategic literature]{.underline}** or considerations of the downsides
of the RMA.86 [The United States has fought several regional wars in
recent decades and in the process has experienced no small amount of
**[confusion and]{.mark} the ["fog of war"]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[as
**computer systems break**]{.mark}]{.underline} down unexpectedly,
[[adversaries **refuse to conform**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the

cyber capabilities Although Chinese writers emphasize the revolutionary
potential of cyberwarfare, [episodes of [Chinese aggression in
cyberspace have been]{.mark}]{.underline} more
**[[mundane]{.underline}]{.mark}**. China's "hacker wars" ºare up during
episodes of tension in Chinese foreign relations, as between Taiwan and
the mainland between 1996 and 2004 in the wake of Taiwanese elections,
between the United States and China following the 1999 bombing of the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade and the 2001 EP-3 spy plane collision, and
between China and Japan throughout the past decade during controversies
involving the Yasukuni Shrine and the Senkaku/ Diaoyu Islands.87
Nationalist hackers (as distinguished from PLA units) deface foreign
websites and launch temporary distributed denial of service attacks.
Nationalist online outbursts may take place with the tacit consent or
encouragement of the Chinese government, yet patriotic "hacktivism" is
essentially just another form of symbolic protest. There has been
speculation that PLA "cyber militias" associated with Chinese
universities maintain a more potent reserve capability, but one study of
open sources suggests that they are oriented toward more mundane
educational and network defense activities.88 The majority of known PLA
cyber operations are CNE for intelligence rather than computer network
attacks to cause disruption.89 Nevertheless, [many analysts worry that
CNE is "only a keystroke away" from CNA]{.underline}, thereby generating
dangerous ambiguity between intelligence gathering and offensive
operations. Intrusion techniques developed for industrial espionage
might be used to plant more dangerous payload code into sensitive
controllers or constitute reconnaissance for future assaults. Chinese
probing of critical infrastructure such as the U.S. power grid is
aggressive, to be sure, so [a latent potential]{.underline} for the PLA
to convert CNE into CNA [cannot be discounted]{.underline}.[90 The
[discovery of]{.mark} access vectors and exploitable

china's fragmented cyber defenses The CCP's obsession with political
"information security" has so far not translated into effective
technical "network security."34 Cybercrime thrives amid a fragmented
bureaucracy. Lax and uneven law enforcement emboldens Chinese
cybercriminals to prey on domestic targets and creates a blatantly open
online underground economy in China. Chinese cybercriminals target
Chinese victims given the relatively low risk of domestic police action;
by comparison, Eastern Europe cybercriminals tend to avoid hacking at
home, instead focusing their predation abroad. Stolen usernames and
passwords, ªnancial data, video game accounts, and hacker tools can be
bought and sold openly on Chinese social media forums such as Baidu and
Tencent QQ. By one estimate, cybercrime damage to the economy exceeded
\$830 million and affected more than 20 percent of users and websites in
2011 alone.35 Rampant cybercrime is a result, in part, of China's
below-average cyber defenses.36 Importantly, networks exposed to
criminal predation are also vulnerable to foreign exploitation, because
state intelligence services use some of the same technology and methods.
[[Cyber]{.mark} policy **coordination**]{.underline} among defense, law
enforcement, and regulatory agencies [[is a **challenge in any
state,**]{.underline} [but China's **lack of**]{.underline}]{.mark}
governmental [**[transparency]{.underline}** [makes a **hard problem
worse**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Prior to 2014, primary responsibility for
cybersecurity policy resided in a subcommittee of the CCP State
Informatization Leading Group (SILG), formed in 2001 to guide national
information technology development or "informatization" (xinxihua) and
chaired by the CCP premier. SILG's early focus on cybersecurity was
eclipsed by the Chinese elite's preoccupation with the 2008 Beijing
Olympics and ªnancial crisis, leaving regulatory agencies and newly
funded companies to their own devices. SILG updated its guidance
criteria in 2012 to reºect renewed concerns about critical
infrastructure and privacy, but elite focus remained sporadic. In
February 2014, amid tension stemming from the Snowden leaks, the CCP
announced the creation of the Cybersecurity and Informatization Leading
Group (CILG), chaired by Xi Jinping (with twenty-one other Politburo or
ministeriallevel ofªcials on the roster).37 The CILG aids Xi's efforts
to tighten Party discipline and respond to foreign cyber threats.38
Greater attention by China's elite via CILG may improve cyber policy
coordination, but prior experience does not bode well. In China, as in
other states, [[a large]{.mark} and diverse [set of]{.mark} public and
private [entities has a stake]{.mark} in the making of cyber policy, yet
the steady stream of cyber friction **does not add up to sustained elite
pressure for reform**]{.underline}. Policy elites with more pressing
priorities usually do not focus consistent pressure on a heterogeneous
set of bureaucratic interests.39 [[Numerous agencies]{.mark} under the
State Council [are responsible]{.mark} for the implementation of policy
and the regulation of information technology in China]{.underline}.
[[The P]{.mark}eople's [L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy]{.underline},
subordinate to the CCP rather than the state, [has
considerable]{.underline} military and intelligence cyber
[capacity]{.underline} as well as civilian regulatory responsibility
(e.g., in the transportation sector). [[Provincial
governments]{.underline}]{.mark}, furthermore,
[[enjoy]{.underline}]{.mark} substantial **[[de facto
autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark}** and compete ªercely for patronage. In
response to a glut of funding for SILG initiatives, expenditure in
China's information security industry grew from \$527 million in 2003 to
\$2.8 billion in 2011. In the assessment of one industry observer,
however, this [[expansion was marred by a "**lack of overall
planning**]{.underline}]{.mark}," "decentralization of decisionmaking
power," [[and a **"lack of adequate
communication."**]{.underline}]{.mark}40 As in other areas of Chinese
policy, [the [implementation]{.mark} of cybersecurity [is
**disjointed**]{.mark} **functionally and regionally**, [rife with
**rent seeking**]{.mark} **by bureaucratic agencies and
enterprises**]{.underline}. [Haphazard interagency cooperation and

[[A significant "**elephant in the room**"]{.underline}]{.mark} issue
[[for NATO]{.mark} cyber]{.underline}space operations [[is]{.mark} the
[possibility of]{.mark}]{.underline} any use of **[[offensive cyber by
the Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Cyber expert James Lewis poses this
challenge as: "The central question for NATO's cyber doctrine is how the
lack of an articulated offensive cyber capability affects its ability to
deter or defend."115 In general, [offensive cyber]{.underline}space
operations [may be considered as the use of cyber capabilities outside
of the defensive firewall of]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline}
network. Such operations could be conducted in support of tactical
activities by forces in the physical domains (e.g., land, sea, or air)
or the operations may be used as long-range strategic weapons directed
at the military and infrastructure of another nation. [The [implications
of the **purposeful use** of devastating cyber]{.mark}]{.underline}
methods [[against a foreign homeland bring up **allusions to**
]{.mark}**the [use of nuclear weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In fact,
Lewis asserts that [[there is a "**cyber club**" with
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}---the [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, the [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[K]{.underline}]{.mark}ingdom, [[and France]{.underline}]{.mark}---that
possess not only nuclear weapons, but also an active offensive
cyberspace capability.116 Indeed, the United States has officially
incorporated offensive cyberspace operations (OCO) in its publicly
available joint doctrine in general terms, but details of any OCO
implementation remain classified.117 In practical terms, [[NATO
may]{.mark} already [be entering the **gray zone** of **developing
active cyber**]{.mark}]{.underline} defense capabilities [[that go
beyond the firewall]{.mark} to neutralize]{.underline} 27 [specific
Internet nodes]{.underline} that are conducting attacks, such as those
that facilitated distributed denial of service actions experienced by
Estonia in 2007. As one NATO cyber officer noted, "NATO has established
a capable defence for most cyber threats, but that is just the first
step and what needs to quickly follow is the development of 'active
defence' capabilities."118 [In implementing]{.underline} such measures,
[[decision-makers must recognize]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[whether
**acts of active cyber defense** are **considered offensive is not up to
the sender**]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather the receiver, because
[[**well-justified defensive acts may be misinterpreted as
aggression**.]{.underline}]{.mark}119 However, [[if NATO
op]{.underline}]{.mark}eration[[s do]{.underline}]{.mark} evolve to
embrace active cyber defense, and then go further to [[adopt OCO]{.mark}
in a manner [similar to that of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}, **the
[issue of political control of OCO release and use must be resolved
first]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}120 Healey and Jordan assert that
the focus should remain on offensive coordination, not capability, and
suggest that NATO should create a group "with voluntary optin for
states, modeled after NATO's existing Nuclear Planning Group, to discuss
and map out an offensive cyber policy."121

NATO's defenses are only as strong as the sum of those of its members.
Like in other domains, [alliance cyber assets are not NATO-owned but
provided by member states.]{.underline}19 [[**U.S. capabilities**
in]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} domain [are]{.mark} by far [the **most
sophisticated among**]{.mark} **the [allies]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Besides
having an edge over most competitors]{.underline} in the field of cyber
security,20 [the United States **tops [ranking]{.mark}s** [as]{.mark} a
**global [leader in offensive cyber
capabilities]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}21 The recent [announcement
that it would contribute its capabilities to NATO operations
consequently could help the alliance **bolster its deterrence posture**
against hostile cyber-attacks.]{.underline}

Until recently, [NATO and member states]{.underline}, including the
United States, have [relied on strictly defensive cyber tools to protect
their infrastructure.]{.underline} However, [given that this approach
has done **little to discourage hostile actors**]{.underline}, the
strategic value of [incorporating **o**ffensive **c**yber **o**perations
has long been discussed.]{.underline} In late 2017, [[Stoltenberg
announced]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[NATO would integrate cyber
weapons]{.mark} of its members into military operations to deter and
defend against threats, [marking the "**biggest overall policy shift in
decades**,"]{.mark}]{.underline} according to officials.22

The U.S. decision to commit offensive and defensive capabilities to NATO
follows on the heels of this move. The [addition of offensive cyber
tools to the defense and deterrence toolbox is not only new for NATO,
it]{.underline} also [tracks a **recent shift in the U.S.
posture**.]{.underline} The White House authorized the use of offensive
cyber weapons to deter foreign adversaries in September following the
publication of the Department of Defense's 2018 Cyber Strategy.23 The
[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[incorporates]{.underline}]{.mark}
a new mission of [["defending forward"]{.mark} as a means to "disrupt or
halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that
falls below the level of armed conflict."]{.underline}24 [While
defending forward is]{.underline}, as the name suggests, [defensive in
nature, [it entails **targeting foreign cyberspace infrastructure** to
**pre-empt incoming attacks** through **o**]{.mark}ffensive
**[c]{.mark}**yber **[o]{.mark}**peration[**s**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This [shift from reactive to preemptive action in cyberspace marks the
most significant departure from the previous U.S. cyber
strategy]{.underline}, published in 2015, and comes in response to
persistent cyber campaigns against the United States directed by Russia
and China. Taken individually, these offenses may fall short of
provoking an official response, but their cumulative impact over time is
a significant concern and needs to be addressed. The [new
[forward-leaning posture]{.mark} of the United States seeks to address
this threat [preemptively **without risking** an **escalation to
conventional military**]{.mark} uses of force.]{.underline}25

[Superior cyber capabilities will not be a deterrent per se, but they
can add to **NATO's resilience** against threats.]{.underline}26
Aggressive cyber operations have already become an important element in
the hybrid warfare tool kit of many adversaries. Adding offensive cyber
capabilities will likely not stop this. That is why [it is critical that
**deterrence against cyber threats** not only relies on cyber
operations, but also draws on the **full spectrum of conventional and
unconventional responses**]{.underline}, as outlined in the 2018
Brussels summit declaration.27

[[Defensive and offensive]{.mark} cyber [capabilities]{.mark} can
[reinforce NATO]{.mark} member[s' ability to deter and deny
cyber-attacks]{.mark} by disincentivizing other actors from developing
cyber weapons in the first place, and by convincing those]{.underline}
with or without offensive cyber capabilities [that attacks will be
largely ineffective or come at an equal or greater cost to them.
Proactive cyber defense]{.underline} also [can]{.underline} help to
[anticipate and prevent an attack on computers and
networks]{.underline}, which requires active monitoring of hostile
actors. This is where [offensive cyber operations provide the most
strategic value.]{.underline} For instance, [they could interfere
directly with operations of adversaries by manipulating their devices
and infrastructure through malware, or by shutting off power and
networks from which an attack originates. [They]{.mark} can]{.underline}
also [**[affect]{.mark} the [calculations of hostile actors]{.mark}**
who may judge that the potential cost of an attack outweighs its
strategic gains.]{.underline}

On the other hand, [**[countering]{.mark} cyber [threats with offensive
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}** [could have a **cascading effect**
that]{.mark} eventually [**precipitates conventional
conflict**.]{.mark}]{.underline}28 A [[more assertive U.S. posture on
cyber]{.mark} could thus potentially **[heighten]{.mark} the risk of an
[unanticipated crisis]{.mark}** [in the **cyber** and **conventional
domains**. This could have **serious implications** for]{.mark} other
**[NATO allies]{.mark} that might [be pulled into a conflict]{.mark}**[,
especially if the **lines between NATO and U.S. cyber operations are
blurred**]{.mark}]{.underline}, based on Mattis' recent statement.

Given the recent blockbuster headlines about alleged Chinese snooping on
server hardware sold to major technology companies and the latest
joint-denunciation of Russian cyber operations, you could be forgiven
for having missed an important NATO-related development. The Associated
Press reports that the [[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} Defense Department
will [announce a]{.underline} new [[**commitment** to use
offensive]{.underline}]{.mark} and defensive cybersecurity
[[capabilities on behalf of NATO allies]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The new commitment is notable given how cybersecurity has long been
treated as an exceptional domain of operations, and cyber capabilities
reserved as strategic national assets to be shared with only the closest
of allies. With this announcement, [the Pentagon is suggesting that
cyber capabilities might be used alongside conventional weapons with
allies]{.underline} and indeed, [**equal weight** appears to be **given
to** offensive and defensive operations]{.underline}. Perhaps most
significantly, the announcement moves NATO partners closer to what has
been a tight coterie of U.S.-favored signals intelligence partners such
as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.

The DoD announcement is a sign of the continued, if nascent,
normalization of cybersecurity under the current administration and in
Europe. [Even where **[o]{.mark}**ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
[**o**p]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} may not rise to the level of war, they
[provide]{.mark} decision-makers with [options to influence the
geopolitical environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. This aligns with recent
trends in the U.S. military to integrate cyber capabilities into
maneuver units and large exercises, and reflects the shift towards more
risk acceptant and offensive measures to counter cyberattacks found in
the 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy.

[[Moving cyber capabilities into the]{.mark} same]{.underline} strategic
[[frame as conventional weapons,]{.mark} **especially [with
NATO]{.mark}**[, reflects a shift in]{.mark} institutional
[cyber]{.mark} arrangements [with]{.mark}in [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and]{.mark}
the [growing power of the **military** relative to]{.mark} the
**[intel]{.mark}ligence community**.]{.underline} For the United States,
cyber capabilities have always had a complicated relationship with the
intelligence community, in particular the National Security Agency
(NSA). When Cyber Command stood up in 2010 as a sub-unified combatant
command within the Department of Defense, it moved into the NSA's
headquarters, staffed its management ranks with longtime NSA employees,
borrowed networks and technical capabilities, and to this day shares a
dual-hatted commander. In the immediate years after the command was
created, it was logical that the structure of partnerships with allies
looked more like the special signals intelligence relationships formed
around the NSA rather than traditional alliance networks in NATO and
Asia. [The recent [announcement aligns cyber op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}
more closely [with D]{.mark}]{.underline}epartment
[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}f [[D]{.underline}]{.mark}efense missions,
[which are more likely to posture capabilities [for deterrent effects,
than **intelligence missions**, which view capabilities as]{.mark}
assets to be [**carefully husbanded**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Treating cybersecurity capabilities more like conventional arms and
less like national assets]{.underline} also [helps drive the integration
of cyber operations into the planning and execution of a broader array
of conventional military missions.]{.underline} Early cyber operations
were largely conventional espionage and surveillance activities
supercharged by the spread of computing and the internet. In the United
States, this led to the creation of large and complex software tools,
carefully guarded by the intelligence community as national assets
(sometimes unsuccessfully). [The]{.underline} DoD's [[announcement
indicates]{.mark} a move towards [treating]{.mark}]{.underline} at least
some of these capabilities, along with their supporting infrastructure,
[[more like **conventional armaments** and making them **available for
broader use**]{.underline}]{.mark}; a model closer to Central or Special
Operations Command and less like the National Security Agency.

[The Pentagon's **new [commitment]{.mark}**]{.underline} also
[[reflects]{.mark} changes]{.underline} in how Europe talks [about
cybersecurity and characterizes the Russian threat. The last two years
have seen [a trend toward]{.mark} more open discussion of offensive
cyber operations and the possibility of the alliance adopting [**more
assertive postures** to **counter cyber
operations**]{.mark}]{.underline} against its members. After years of
devastating ransomware attacks and cyber-enabled information attacks,
[[NATO members **are** ]{.mark}**more [willing to explore cyber triggers
to Article 5]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They have also been [more willing
to articulate the cyber threat against the alliance]{.underline}. In
addition to last week's denunciation by Dutch, UK, and U.S. authorities,
Russian state actors are widely suggested to be responsible for an
increasingly brazen series of operations, including targeting German
government ministries, French and British TV stations, and more.

Sharing offensive cyber capabilities raises the question of whether
cyber operations can extend effective deterrence to NATO partners. There
seems to be little focus on using these operations to deter conventional
or nuclear attacks on NATO countries, but this may evolve. The United
States seems to want NATO to use cyber operations to deter other cyber
operations, particularly those falling under the threshold of armed
conflict. [[Cyber op]{.underline}]{.mark}eration[[s]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} **all sorts of [problems for deterrence]{.mark}**[:
**signaling is difficult**]{.mark}]{.underline}, they can be
**[[perceived as a cheap threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and their
[**[effects]{.mark} are largely
[uncertain]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} By contrast, moving new
military forces in Eastern Europe or conducting ground exercises are
credible signals of extended deterrence, but are costly and time
consuming. Cyber capabilities aren't free, nor are they necessarily
cheap, but the promise to use them can add new credibility to a
deterrent threat without the same investment and delay as conventional
alternatives. [[Sharing cyber capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} may be
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} cheaper [[way to **signal alliance
commitment**]{.underline}]{.mark} than other options and might signal a
further maturation, and acceptance, of cybersecurity into geopolitics.

The Myth of the Offense

Contrary to observed patterns of limited disruption and espionage, Cyber
Command sees cyberspace as a domain fraught with increasing risk, where
great powers such as China and Russia will undermine American power. The
only solution, from this perspective, is to go on the offense. Yet, [the
[benefits of an offensive posture]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially in
cyberspace, [[are]{.mark} mostly **[illusory]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
date. Instead, the [cyber]{.underline} domain [tends to be optimized for
defense and **deception**, not **decisive offensive
blows**.]{.underline} Not only is [offense]{.underline} likely the
weaker form of competition in cyberspace, it also **[risks inadvertent
escalation]{.underline}**. The fear, suspicion, and misperception that
characterize interstate rivalries exacerbate the risk of offensive
action in cyberspace.

Cyber Command's 2018 persistent-action strategy aims to "expose
adversaries' weaknesses, learn their intentions and capabilities, and
counter attacks close to their origins."44 Put in simple terms, the best
defense is a good offense: get on adversary networks and stop cyber
operations targeting the United States before they occur. Under this
strategy, offensive cyber operations will also be preemptive in that
they are designed to "contest dangerous adversary activity before it
impairs \[U.S.\] national power."45 To use another sports metaphor, come
out swinging. Go on the offense first and establish escalation dominance
(that is, demonstrating such superior capabilities over the target state
that it can't afford to escalate in response).46

According to Cyber Command, preemptive strikes will "impose . . .
strategic costs on our adversaries, compelling them to shift resources
to defense and reduce attacks."47 Whether through punishment, risk, or
denial strategies, offensive actions theoretically alter the target's
behavior by increasing the expected costs of targeting U.S. interests.48
Offensive action, according to this thinking, deters future aggression
by signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance. Yet, there
are well-established reasons to doubt that offensive options produce the
intended results in cyberspace.

Defense and Deception

The rationale behind persistent action---that the best defense is a good
offense---is deeply flawed. In fact, most military and strategic theory
holds that the defense is the superior posture.49 For example, Sun Tzu
describes controlling an adversary to make their actions more
predictable, and hence easy to undermine, by baiting them to attack
strong points.50 The stronger form of war is a deception-driven defense:
confusing an attacker so that they waste resources attacking strong
points that appear weak. This parallels cybersecurity scholars Erik
Gartzke and Jon Lindsay's claim that [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}space
[[is **not offense** ]{.mark}**dominant**, **[but deception
dominant]{.mark}**]{.underline}.51 [Rather than persistent]{.underline}
action and [preemptive strikes]{.underline} on adversary networks, the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[needs
**persistent deception** and **defensive counterstrikes**]{.mark}
optimized [to undermine adversary planning and
capabilities.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Fear and the Security Dilemma

[New policy options]{.underline} proposed [by Cyber Command
and]{.underline} the **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration
risk [[exacerbat]{.underline}]{.mark}ing fear in other countries and
creating a self-reinforcing spiral of tit-for-tat escalations that risk
war even though each actor feels he is acting defensively---or, as it is
called in the scholarly literature, [[a **security
dilemma**]{.underline}]{.mark}.52 As shown above, [most cyber
op]{.underline}eration[s to date have not resulted in
escalation]{.underline}. [The cyber domain has been a world of
spies]{.underline} collecting valuable information [and engaging in
limited disruptions that **substitute** for]{.underline}, as well as
complement, [more conventional options]{.underline}. [Shifting
to]{.underline} a policy of **[[preemptive offensive
cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}** warfare [[risks **provoking fear** and
**overreaction**]{.underline}]{.mark} in other states and possibly
producing conflict spirals. [[Even
limited]{.underline}]{.mark}-objective cyber offensive
[[action]{.underline}]{.mark} defined as ["**defending forward**" [can
be **misinterpreted** and lead to **inadvertent
escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.53 As the historian Cathal Nolan puts
it, "intrusions into a state's strategically important networks pose
serious risks and are therefore inherently threatening."54

More worryingly, with a more offensive posture, it will be increasingly
difficult for states to differentiate between cyber espionage and more
damaging degradation operations.55 [[What]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[calls
**defending forward**, **China and Russia will call preemptive
strikes**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Worse still, [[this]{.mark} posture
[will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[lead great powers to assume
all]{.mark} network [intrusions]{.mark}, including espionage, [are
preparing]{.mark} the environment [for **follow-on offensive
strikes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to cybersecurity scholar Ben
Buchanan, "in the \[aggressor\] state's own view, such moves are clearly
defensive, merely ensuring that its military will have the strength and
flexibility to meet whatever comes its way. Yet potential adversaries
are unlikely to share this perspective."56 The new strategy risks
[[producing a "**forever cyber war**"]{.mark} prone to **inadvertent
escalation**]{.underline} because it implies all cyber operations should
be interpreted as escalatory by adversaries.57
