### Security Cooperation

#### Security cooperation is security assistance, combined exercises, international arms cooperation, and information sharing

\*\*\*SC = security cooperation, PN = Partner Nation

**Scott 2017** \[Kevin D., "Security Cooperation" 23 May 2017

for the Joint Chiefs of Staff"

SC encompasses all DOD **[interactions, programs, and activities with
foreign security forces (FSF) and their institutions to build
relationships that help promote US interests]{.underline}**; **[enable
PNs to provide the US access to territory, infrastructure, information,
and resources; and/or to build and apply their capacity and capabilities
consistent with US defense objectives.]{.underline}** It includes, but
is not limited to, **[military engagements]{.underline}** with foreign
defense and security establishments (including those governmental
organizations that primarily perform disaster or emergency response
functions), **[DOD-administered security assistance]{.underline}** (SA)
**[programs, combined exercises, international armaments cooperation,
and information sharing and collaboration.]{.underline}**

#### Building capacity means developing capabilities, integrating developed military capabilities, employing capabilities, and maintainence. 

https://www.dsca.mil/50th-anniversary/institutional-capacity-building

[Institutional Capacity
Building](https://instituteforsecuritygovernance.org/documents/113018911/125185574/ICB+Planning+V6.4.pdf) (ICB)
programs, overseen by DSCA, encompass Security Cooperation activities
that directly support U.S. ally and partner nation efforts to improve
security sector governance and core management competencies necessary to
effectively and responsibly achieve shared security objectives.
Understanding **[an ally or partner's institutional capacity is critical
to the development of a full-spectrum approach to Security
Cooperation]{.underline}**.  A Full-Spectrum approach assists allies and
partners by ensuring they have all that is necessary and sufficient to
successfully perform a security role in support of shared objectives.
ICB assists allies and partners in examining and addressing broader,
systemic factors essential to delivering what is needed (e.g., money,
things, people, ideas, decisions) to:

1.  Understand requirements, **[develop forces, and purchase or obtain
    the articles and services as required to develop, employ, and
    sustain required capabilities]{.underline}**;

2.  Successfully **[absorb and integrate fully developed capabilities
    into their existing security forces;]{.underline}**

3.  Effectively and **[responsibly employ those capabilities in the
    pursuit of common objectives between the U.S. and the ally or
    partner; and]{.underline}**

4.  **[Adequately staff, sustain, and maintain, those capabilities
    throughout their lifecycle and eventually retire them when
    appropriate]{.underline}**.

#### Isn't security assistance -- different agencies in the USFG.

**CRS 2016** \["DOD Security Cooperation: An Overview of Authorities and
Issues" 23 August 2016
https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20160823_R44602_e41f79489b9b3f8686a73d6ff65b2dcb9b696ba2.pdf\]

\"Security assistance\" and \"security cooperation\" are two terms that
refer to U.S. activities to train, equip, and otherwise assist foreign
partners. The term security assistance is a generic term used throughout
the U.S. government to describe assistance provided to foreign military
and security forces, regardless of the agency providing that assistance.
However, **[DOD uses the term security assistance to refer specifically
to assistance provided under Title 22 authority, funded with monies
appropriated to the State Department and managed by the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency (DSCA),]{.underline}** an agency under the Office of
the Secretary of Defense,
Policy.[^3^](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44602.html#fn3)

**[DOD defines \"security cooperation\" as a broad set of activities
undertaken by DOD to encourage and enable international partners to work
with the United States to achieve strategic objectives.]{.underline}**
Included in the definition are DOD interactions with both foreign
defense and foreign nonmilitary security establishments. Security
cooperation includes all DOD-administered security assistance programs
that (1) build defense and security relationships that promote specific
U.S. security interests, including all international armaments
cooperation activities and security assistance activities; (2) develop
allied and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and
multinational operations; and (3) provide U.S. forces with peacetime and
contingency access to host
nations.[^4^](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44602.html#fn4) According
to DOD, security assistance is a subset of DOD\'s security cooperation
portfolio.

Authority for DOD to conduct security cooperation activities is enacted
in two primary places: Title 10 (Armed Forces) U.S.C. and National
Defense Authorization Acts

#### 1NC - Training and Interoperability are not topical under security cooperation

**Bowne '18** \[Andrew 2018 *Military Law Review,* "Defending the New
Fulda Gap: Deterring Russian Aggression Against the Baltic States
Through Fiscal Legislation, 226 Mil. L. Rev. 147\]

Despite bipartisan criticism of the perceived lack of funding from other
NATO members, the United States still recognizes that its leadership in
the Alliance is vital to its own national security. 78 There are clear
benefits to combined defense in terms of national security, foreign
relations, and the economy, 79 placing U.S. funding of NATO at the
intersection of foreign and domestic policy. While the President has
constitutional authority in defense, as the Commander-in-Chief, and to
enter into agreements with foreign states, 80 Congress can affect both
defense and foreign affairs through its power of the purse. 81
Accordingly, this section analyzes the reflection of U.S. foreign and
defense policies through Congressional authorizations and appropriations
that affect the implementation of Operation Atlantic Resolve\'s lines of
operation, particularly in increasing interoperability and improving the
defense capacity of the Baltic States. 82

A. Congress\'s Role in Funding NATO Operations

Congress\'s power to authorize expenditures through legislation is
instrumental in national security and foreign relations, as it
determines the amount and purpose for which expenditures are authorized.
83 Because military activities and foreign assistance require
expenditures of funds, the United States cannot implement its strategic
goals in Eastern Europe without fiscal authority. 84 The
constitutionally provided power of the purse therefore places Congress
as the cornerstone of the United States\' participation in NATO
operations. While U.S. funding for deterring Russian aggression is
complex and lacks clarity, sources of funding generally fall within
three categories: service component funds, the European
Reassurance/Deterrence Initiative, and security cooperation.

B. Building Better Allies through Funding Resources

1\. Service Operations & Maintenance Funds

As the Unified Combatant Command with an area of responsibility covering
Europe and Russia, EUCOM is tasked with managing theater requirements,
to include supporting NATO operations and meeting U.S. national security
objectives. 85 While EUCOM has authority over the conduct of operations
within this region, it is the military services that receive direct
funding from Congress through Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funds. 86
Like all Unified Combatant Commands during the budget planning phase,
EUCOM is limited to providing inputs to influence the armed services,
and sets priorities for funding, but Congress may appropriate different
amounts and purposes than requested by the combatant commander. 87

To the extent an expense is necessary, fits within EUCOM\'s mission, and
funds are authorized and appropriated, O&M funds are available for the
expenditure, 88 unless the expense is covered by a more specific
appropriation. 89 Another caveat is that the expenditure of funds must
be for the primary benefit of the United States. 90 These two
limitations to the use of service O&M funds obfuscate the analysis of
how to fund operations in support of the NATO mission properly. First,
it is unclear which agency\'s funds can be used. **[Under the Foreign
Assistance Act, the Department of State (DoS) is the agency responsible
for coordinating all foreign development activities.]{.underline}** 91
**[An exception to the Foreign Assistance Act is when Congress
specifically authorizes the Department of Defense (DoD) to obligate
defense funding for the benefit of a foreign state, military or
population, or if the funding is for \"little t\"
training.]{.underline}** 92 Because \"**[little t\" training, which
protects U.S. forces by promoting safety, familiarization, and
interoperability with foreign forces, does not constitute security
cooperation, such activities are funded by O&M]{.underline}**. However,
a second issue arises because most efforts to build NATO ally and
partner capacity likely will exceed the parameters of \"little t\"
training and will fall under the umbrella of foreign assistance.
Accordingly, funding for such security cooperation programs will come
from more specific appropriations, as described below.

#### 2AC -- Security cooperation broader: Security coop entails transferring defense articles, mil-to-mil exercises, military education, and building partner capacity. Both DOD-implemented Title 22 and DOD-administered Title 10 programs are topical. 

**Arabia '21** \[Christina; May 17; CRS Analyst in Security Assistance,
Security Cooperation and the Global Arms Trade; Congressional Research
Service, "Defense Primer: DOD "Title 10" Security Cooperation,"
https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF11677.pdf\]

Security Cooperation (SC) Overview

**[The Department of Defense (DOD) uses the term security cooperation
(SC) to refer broadly to DOD interactions with foreign security
establishments]{.underline}**. SC activities include

**[• the transfer of defense articles and services;]{.underline}**

**[• military-to-military exercises;]{.underline}**

**[• military education, training, and advising; and]{.underline}**

**[• capacity building of partner security forces.]{.underline}**

SC programs are intended to encourage and enable partner nations (PNs)
to work with the United States to achieve strategic objectives. They are
considered a key tool for achieving U.S. national security and foreign
policy objectives. These activities are executed through both
DOD-administered SC programs (authorized under Title 10, U.S.C.) and
DOD-implemented State Department (DOS) security assistance (SA) programs
(authorized under Title 22, U.S.C). Beyond grant-based programs, SC
encompasses the Foreign Military Sales program and enables U.S. and PN
collaboration on defense articles. The following sections focus on DOD
"Title 10" activities.

SC: Policy and Objectives

SC activities aim to achieve particular objectives in support of U.S.
national security and defense strategies. Specifically, SC may build
defense relationships that promote U.S. security interests, enhance
military capabilities of U.S. allies and partners, and provide the
United States with access to PNs. Under the overarching goal of
furthering U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, SC
emphasizes partnerships, aiming to be mutually beneficial for the United
States and its partners. SC activities aim to develop and strengthen a
PN's ability to provide internal security, contribute to regional
security efforts, combat shared threats, and increase military
interoperability with the United States.

The 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) signaled the Trump
Administration's intention to shift SC activities from nearly two
decades of prioritizing counterterrorism toward "great power
competition" (GPC) with Russia and China. The shift raised questions as
to how SC should be realigned to meet this objective and what the
implications could be for scaling down counterterrorism-focused SC
activities in Africa and the Middle East, especially as Russia and China
increase their influence. Some DOD officials and defense analysts have
suggested that rather than a shift, counterterrorism, as well as
irregular warfare, should remain priorities within GPC. The Biden
Administration has yet to release a new NDS; however, its Interim
National Security Strategic Guidance broadly identifies authoritarianism
and strategic competition as priority threats that require coordination
and cooperation with allies and partners.

SC: Roles and Responsibilities

Many SC activities require DOD to coordinate with multiple DOD
components and other federal departments, primarily DOS. Some DOD SC
activities require varying levels of coordination with DOS. Within DOD,
the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy (USD\[P\]) exercises overall
direction, authority, and control over SC matters.

The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) represents the interests
of the Secretary of Defense and USD(P) in SC matters and is tasked with
directing, administering, and executing many SC programs, developing SC
policy, and providing DOD-wide SC guidance. DSCA is also DOD's main
interlocutor between the PNs, implementing agencies, and the defense
industry. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and
Low-Intensity Conflict (ASD-SO/LIC) oversees and approves some SC
training activities that are managed by DSCA. U.S. Special Operations
Command (SOCOM) coordinates those SC activities executed by special
operations forces (SOF). DOS leads U.S. foreign aid and has final say on
SA. DOS's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM) is the principal
link to DOD and ensures that SA is integrated with other U.S. policies
and activities at the country, regional, and global levels. PM also
determines PN eligibility, appropriate SA programs, and which defense
articles and equipment are permitted for transfer.

### NATO

#### NATO is the military alliance of member countries.

#### Dictionary.com ND https://www.dictionary.com/browse/nato

**North Atlantic Treaty Organization:** **[a political and military
alliance of countries in Europe and North America established in
Washington, D.C. (1949) for the purpose of collective defense against
aggression]{.underline}**, comprising Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France,
Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, the United
Kingdom, the United States, Greece, Turkey, Germany, Spain, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Albania, Croatia, Montenegro, and North
Macedonia.

#### NATO is a consensus based alliance -- individual countries belong to NATO, but are not NATO itself.

**Masters 2022** \[Jonathan, "What is NATO" via *Council on Foreign
Relations*
https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-nato#chapter-title-0-4\]

Headquartered in Brussels, **[NATO is a consensus-based alliance in
which decisions must be unanimous. However, individual states or
subgroups of allies can initiate action outside NATO's
auspices.]{.underline}** For instance, the United States, France, and
the United Kingdom began policing a UN-sanctioned no-fly zone in Libya
in early 2011 and, within days, transferred command of the operation to
NATO once [Turkey's
concerns](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-turkey/turkey-opposes-any-nato-operation-in-libya-idUSTRE72D49D20110314) had
been allayed. Member states are not required to participate in every
NATO operation; Germany and Poland declined to contribute directly to
the campaign in Libya.

NATO's military structure comprises two strategic commands: the Supreme
Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, located near Mons, Belgium, and the
Allied Command Transformation, located in Norfolk, Virginia. The supreme
allied commander Europe oversees all NATO military operations and is
always a U.S. flag or general officer; U.S. Air Force General Tod D.
Wolters currently holds this position. Although the alliance has an
integrated command, most forces remain under their respective national
authorities until NATO operations commence.

#### Must be North Atlantic Council

**NATO handbook 2006
\[https://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2006/hb-en-2006/Part2.pdf\]**

The **[North Atlantic Council (NAC) has effective political authority
and powers of decision, and consists of permanent representatives of all
member countries meeting together at least once a week]{.underline}**.
The Council also meets at higher levels involving foreign ministers,
defence ministers or heads of state and government, but it has the same
authority and powers of decisionmaking, and its decisions have the same
status and validity, at whatever level it meets. The Council has an
important public profile and issues declarations and communiqués
explaining the Alliance's policies and decisions to the general public
and to governments of countries which are not members of NATO. The
Council is the only body within the Alliance which derives its authority
explicitly from the North Atlantic Treaty. The Council itself was given
responsibility under the Treaty for setting up subsidiary bodies. Many
committees and planning groups have since been created to support the
work of the Council or to assume responsibility in specific fields such
as defence planning, nuclear planning and military matters. The Council
thus provides a unique forum for wide-ranging consultation between
member governments on all issues affecting their security and is the
most important decision-making body in NATO. All member countries of
NATO have an equal right to express their views round the Council table.
Decisions are the expression of the collective will of member
governments arrived at by common consent. All member governments are
party to the policies formulated in the Council or under its authority
and share in the consensus on which decisions are based.

#### Aff must fiat proposal. Normal means is that the proposal goes to the Secretary General and the North Atlantic Council. 

**Michel 2006** Leo. \"NATO Decisionmaking: How the "Consensus Rule"
Works.\" *Croatian International Relations Review* 12, no. 42/43 (2006):
7-14.

Although international security affairs cognoscenti often refer to the
NATO consensus rule, the North Atlantic Treaty does not specify how
collective decisions are to be made, with one exception: the Article 10
provision that \"unanimous agreement\" is necessary to invite a state to
join the Alliance. **[Absent any explicit voting procedure, NATO has
developed a set of customary practices. Most decisions are based on
draft proposals circulated to all Allies by the Secretary General, who
chairs the North Atlantic Council (NAC), or by the chairperson of one of
the hundreds of NATO committees and working groups]{.underline}**.\'
These draft proposals may be initiated by the Secretary General, the IS,
or individual Allies. Written proposals generally are preceded by
consultations in a variety of forums, including bilateral or
multilateral discussions in allied capitals, Allied missions at NATO
Headquarters, the NAC, and committees and working groups established by
the NAC. Such consultations are useful indeed, in some cases they are
critical-to identify possible concerns or objections among Allies and to
craft mutually acceptable solutions. When a written decision or
statement of position is deemed necessary, it frequently occurs that
some or all of the Permanent Representatives (Perm Reps) cannot provide
their respective national positions at the conclusion of a specific AC
or committee meeting. In such cases, the Secretary General or relevant
committee chairperson may opt to circulate the draft proposal under a
silence procedure.\' If no Ally \"breaks silence\"-that is, notifies the
IS in writing of its objection before the deadline set by the Secretary
General or committee chairperson-the proposal is considered approved.
However, if one or more Ally breaks silence, the proposal is normally
referred back to the relevant body for further work to reach consensus.
As a rule, NATO does not publicly identify which countries break
silence, although national positions may be leaked to the press
(sometimes by the country breaking silence) if the issue is contentious.
Moreover, as there is no formal voting procedure, there is no formal
abstention procedure, either.

### Artificial Intelligence

#### Minimum -- threshold interpretation

Samoili, Sofia, Montserrat Lopez Cobo, Emilia Gomez, Giuditta De Prato,
Fernando Martinez-Plumed, and Blagoj Delipetrev. \"AI Watch. Defining
Artificial Intelligence. Towards an operational definition and taxonomy
of artificial intelligence.\" (2020).

Despite the multiple facets of AI, and consequently the lack of a common
definition, there are a number of commonalities that we observe in the
analysed definitions. This expression of common aspects suggests that
they may be considered as the main features of AI: --- **[[Perception of
the environment, including the consideration of the real world
complexity]{.underline}]{.mark}** (HLEG, 2019; European AI Strategy,
2018; EC JRC Flagship report on AI, 2018; Tsinghua University, 2018;

1995; Albus, 1991; Newell and Simon, 1976). --- **[[Information
processing: collecting and interpreting inputs]{.underline}]{.mark}**

University, 2018; Nakashima, 1999; Nilsson, 1998; Poole et al., 1998;
Wang, 1995). --- **[[Decision making]{.underline}]{.mark}** (including
reasoning and learning): **[[taking actions, performance of
tasks]{.underline}]{.mark}** (including adaptation, reaction to changes
in the environment) **[[with certain level of

systems]{.underline}]{.mark}** (HLEG 2019; OECD, 2019; European AI
Strategy, 2018; Kaplan and Haenlein, 2018; Poole at al., 1998; Fogel,
1995; Albus, 1991; Newell and Simon, 1976).

#### HLEG definitions -- AI is software and can include hardware that seeks to accomplish a goal by perceiving the environment through data acquisition and independent reasoning using such data.

Samoili, Sofia, Montserrat Lopez Cobo, Emilia Gomez, Giuditta De Prato,
Fernando Martinez-Plumed, and Blagoj Delipetrev. \"AI Watch. Defining
Artificial Intelligence. Towards an operational definition and taxonomy
of artificial intelligence.\" (2020).

HLEG definition of AI \"Artificial intelligence (**[AI) systems are
software (and possibly also hardware) systems designed by humans(2)
that, given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital dimension by
perceiving their environment through data acquisition, interpreting the
collected structured or unstructured data, reasoning on the knowledge,
or processing the information, derived from this data and deciding the
best action(s)]{.underline}** to take to achieve the given goal. AI
systems can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model, and they
can also adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is
affected by their previous actions.\"

#### National Defense Authorization Act -- AI has five tenets (inclusive of all five tenets).

John S. McCain **National Defense Authorization Act**, Section 1051 for
Fiscal Year **2019** https://www.nscai.gov/about/authorization-act/

(f) **DEFINITION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE**.---In this section, the
term ''artificial intelligence'' includes each of the following:

\(1\) Any artificial system that performs **[tasks under varying and
unpredictable circumstances without significant human
oversight,]{.underline}** or that can learn from experience and improve
performance when exposed to data sets.

\(2\) **[An artificial system developed in computer software, physical
hardware, or other context that solves tasks requiring human-like

**Samoili et al 2020** \[Sofia, Montserrat Lopez Cobo, Emilia Gomez,
Giuditta De Prato, Fernando Martinez-Plumed, and Blagoj Delipetrev. \"AI
Watch. Defining Artificial Intelligence. Towards an operational
definition and taxonomy of artificial intelligence.\" (2020).\]

2.2.1 AI taxonomy The proposed taxonomy addresses political, research
and industrial perspectives and aims to cover and classify the AI
landscape, which consists of economic agents with R&D or industrial AI
related activities. Therefore, this taxonomy is able to detect
correspondingly a wide range of core AI related scientific subdomains
(e.g. knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning) and
transversal topics such as applications of the former (e.g. robots,
automated vehicles, etc.) or ethical and philosophical considerations.
The taxonomy is presented as a reduced list of abstract high level
domains and their related subdomains. These are meant to encompass the
main theoretical AI branches, as well as AI related non-technological
issues. The AI subdomains are represented by a list of keywords (see
subsection 2.2.2), these will enable us to capture the AI activities
carried out by economic agents, for further analysis of the AI landscape
from a techno-economic perspective.

#### OECD and UN -- AI is acquiring and applying knowledge and carrying out intelligent behavior.

https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/ESCAP_Artificial_Intelligence.pdf

There is no universally agreed definition of AI. According to OECD1 and
UNCTAD2 , **[AI is defined as the ability of machines and systems to
acquire and apply knowledge, and to carry out intelligent
behaviou]{.underline}**r. This includes a variety of cognitive tasks
(e.g. sensing, processing oral language, reasoning, learning, making
decisions) and demonstrating an ability to move and manipulate objects
accordingly. Intelligent systems use a combination of big data
analytics, cloud computing, machineto-machine communication and the
Internet of Things (IoT) to operate and learn. AI is a software and
generally algorithm based although its functions (e.g. talking or
playing a game) need to be reflected by physical substance (such as
robots). In this sense, AI is like a human brain. To date, AI
development has been generally focused on a selection of specific
domains (see Table 1).

#### Machine learning is AI -- Agrawal. We meet.

Economic Policy for Artificial Intelligence

Ajay **Agrawal**, Joshua **Gans,** **and** Avi **Goldfarb**

Innovation Policy and the Economy **2019** 19:, 139-159

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/699935

The economic impact of computer intelligence that can do what humans do
would be extraordinary. At the NBER Conference on AI in September 2017
Kahneman
([2018](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/699935#rf40))
noted, "I do not think that there is very much that we can do that
computers will not eventually be programmed to do." That said, the
technology that has generated the recent excitement around AI is not
true artificial general intelligence. Instead, the majority of recent
advances have come from a field of AI called "machine learning," which
is a branch of computational statistics.

**[The Oxford English Dictionary defines artificial intelligence as "the
theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks
normally requiring human intelligence." This definition is both broad
and fluid]{.underline}**. There is an old joke among computer scientists
that artificial intelligence defines what machines cannot yet do. Before
a machine could beat a human expert at chess, such a win would mean
artificial intelligence. After the famed match between IBM's Deep Blue
and Gary Kasparov, playing chess was called computer science and other
challenges became artificial intelligence.

Computer chess and other early attempts at machine intelligence were
primarily rules-based, symbolic logic. It involved human experts
generating instructions codified as algorithms
(Domingos [2015](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/699935#rf24)).
By the 1980s, it became clear that outside of very controlled
environments, such rules-based systems failed. They did not cope with
the complexity of most applications and AI research funding largely
dried up
(Markov [2015](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/699935#rf44)).

**[More recently, a different approach has taken off: machine learning.
The idea is to have computers "learn" from example data. Humans conduct
many tasks that are difficult to codify.]{.underline}** For example,
humans are good at recognizing familiar faces, but we would struggle to
explain this skill. By connecting data on names to image data on faces,
machine learning solves this problem by predicting which image data
patterns are associated with which names.

Economists looking at a machine-learning textbook will find many
familiar topics, including multiple regression, principal components
analysis, and maximum likelihood estimation, along with some that are
less familiar such as hidden Markov models, neural networks, deep
learning, and reinforcement learning. Even these are not entirely new.
Igami
([2018](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/699935#rf39))
highlights similarities between these topics and structural econometrics
models such as Rust
([1987](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/699935#rf51)).
Unlike the typical emphasis of econometricians on causal inference,
machine learning focuses on prediction. As machine learning pioneer
Geoffrey Hinton put it, "Take any old problem where you have to predict
something and you have a lot of data, and deep learning is probably
going to make it work better than existing
techniques."[^3^](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/699935#fn3) In
our own work (Agrawal, Gans, and
Goldfarb [2018b](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/699935#rf7), [2018c](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/699935#rf8), [2018d](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/699935#rf9)),
we explore the consequences of a drop in the quality-adjusted cost of
prediction on organizations and on the nature of work. We define
prediction as the ability to take known information to generate new
information. Better prediction is likely to have widespread consequences
because prediction is fundamental to decision-making.

Therefore, like the steam engine, electrification, and the internet,
AI---defined by machine learning---is likely to be a general purpose
technology (GPT). As Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson
([2018](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/699935#rf18))
argue, machine learning is likely to impact a wide range of sectors, and
there is no doubt that technological progress has been rapid. They note
that error rates in image recognition improved by an order of magnitude
between 2010 and 2016. There have been rapid improvements in areas from
language translation to medical diagnosis. As a GPT, it is likely to be
an enabling technology that opens up new opportunities. For example,
while electric motors did reduce energy costs, the productivity impact
was largely driven by increased flexibility in the design and location
of factories
(David [1990](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/699935#rf21)).
This process of coinvention is costly and slow (Bresnahan and
Greenstein [1996](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/699935#rf16)).

Defining AI is not merely an academic exercise, particularly when
drafting legislation. AI research and applications are evolving rapidly.
Thus, congressional consideration of whether to include a definition for
AI in a bill, and if so how to define the term or related terms,
necessarily include attention to the scope of the legislation and the
current and future applicability of the definition. Considerations in
crafting a definition for use in legislation include whether it is
expansive enough not to hinder the future applicability of a law as AI
develops and evolves, while being narrow enough to provide clarity on
the entities the law affects. Some stakeholders, recognizing the many
challenges of defining AI, have attempted to define principles that
might help guide policymakers. Research suggests that differences in
definitions used to identify AI related research may contribute to
significantly different analyses and outcomes regarding AI competition,
investments, technology transfer, and application forecasts.5 **[The
John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for]{.underline}**
Fiscal Year 2019 (P.L. 115-232) **[included the first definition of AI
in federal statute.6 Like those in other previously introduced bills,
the definition incorporated a commonly cited framework of four possible
goals that AI systems may pursue: systems that think like
humans]{.underline}** (e.g., neural networks), **[act like
humans]{.underline}** (e.g., natural language processing), **[think
rationally]{.underline}** (e.g., logic solvers), **[or act
rationally]{.underline}** (e.g., intelligent software agents embodied in
robots).7 However, AI research and applications do not necessarily fall
solely within any one of these four categories.

While there is no single, commonly agreed upon definition of AI, the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has described AI
technologies and systems as **[comprising "software and/or hardware that
can learn to solve complex problems, make predictions or undertake tasks
that require human-like sensing]{.underline}** (such as vision, speech,
and touch), perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication, or
physical action." 3 Definitions may vary according to the discipline in
which AI is being discussed.4 AI is often described as a field that
encompasses a range of methodologies and application areas, such as
machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and robotics.

this report the terms 'autonomous' and 'AI' will both be used. The
authors acknowledge that to many familiar with the technical
terminology, 'autonomy' and 'artificial intelligence' may be considered
distinct terms. Agreement on what the terms 'autonomy' and 'AI' mean
varies within academic literature, often in inconsistent ways. For
instance, some no longer consider 'first-wave' systems, which do not use
ML, to be AI. Scharre and Horowitz (2015) propose a basic definition of
autonomy when writing about autonomous weapons. They write that
'autonomy is the ability of a machine to perform a task without human
input', though they point out that this may or may not involve aspects
of artificial-intelligence technology.16 Some also make a distinction
between 'autonomous' systems and 'automated' or 'automatic' systems. For
example, NATO's Allied Command Transformation differentiates between
'autonomous' systems and 'automated' systems in the following way: →
**[autonomous functioning refers to the ability of a system, platform,
or software to complete a task without human intervention, using
behaviours resulting from the interaction of computer programming with
the external environment. Tasks or functions executed by a platform, or
distributed between a platform and other parts of the system, may be
performed using a variety of behaviours, which may include reasoning and
problem solving, adaptation to unexpected situations, self-direction,
and learning]{.underline}**. Which functions are autonomous -- and the
extent to which human operators can direct, control, or cancel functions
-- is determined by system design trade-offs, mission complexity,
external operating environment conditions, and legal or policy
constraints. This can be contrasted with automated functions, which
(although they require no human intervention) operate using a fixed set
of inputs, rules, and outputs, the behaviour of which is deterministic
and largely predictable. Automatic functions do not permit the dynamic
adaptation of inputs, rules, or outputs.17 Given the frequent conflation
of the terms 'autonomy', 'autonomous systems', and 'AI' in documents
reviewed for this report, the authors' terminology follows the tendency
of a number of **[NATO members to define AI and autonomy as technologies
capable of going further than automated behaviour. Within this report,
the word 'autonomous' will generally be used to describe first-wave-like
systems that physically operate on their own and respond to their
external environments. The term 'AI' will be used to describe
second-wave data analytics, control systems, and decision support
systems.]{.underline}** When describing specific military systems, the
authors use the same terms used by the manufacturers or by third-party
experts describing the system (for example, L3Harris describes its
MAST-9 ASV as 'autonomous', so the authors describe the MAST-9 as
'autonomous'). Within this scope, autonomous systems do not necessarily
represent or contain AI-enabled or ML capabilities.

#### AI -- is four subfields: machine learning, natural language processing, artificial neural networks, computer vision

**Hashimoto 2018** \[Daniel A et al. "Artificial Intelligence in
Surgery: Promises and Perils." *Annals of surgery* vol. 268,1 (2018):
70-76. doi:10.1097/SLA.0000000000002693\]

Artificial intelligence (AI) can be loosely defined as the study of
algorithms that give machines the ability to reason and perform
cognitive functions such as problem solving, object and word
recognition, and decision-making.1 Previously thought to be science
fiction, AI has increasingly become the topic of both popular and
academic literature as years of research have finally built to
thresholds of knowledge that have rapidly generated practical
applications, such as International Business Machine's (Armonk, NY, USA)
Watson and Tesla's (Palo Alto, CA, USA) autopilot.2 Stories of
man-versus-machine, such as that of John Henry working to death to
outperform the steam-powered hammer3 , demonstrate how machines have
long been feared yet ultimately both accepted and eagerly anticipated.
Society proceeded to integrate simple machines into human workflow, and
the resulting Industrial Revolution yielded a massive shift in
productivity and quality of life. Similarly, AI has inspired awe and
struck fear in people who now face a technology that can not only
outperform but also potentially outthink its creators. With the
Information Age, a shift in workflow and productivity similar to that of
the Industrial Revolution has begun; and surgery stands to gain from the
current explosion of information technology. However, as with many
emerging technologies, the true promise of AI can be lost in its hype.4
It is, therefore, important for surgeons to have a foundation of
knowledge of AI to understand how it may impact healthcare and to
consider ways in which they may interact with this technology. This
review provides an introduction to AI by highlighting four core
subfields -- **[1) machine learning, 2) natural language processing, 3)
artificial neural networks, 4) computer vision]{.underline}** -- their
limitations, and future implications for surgeons. Subfields in AI AI's
roots are found across multiple fields, including robotics, philosophy,
psychology, linguistics, and statistics.5 Major advances in computer
science, such as improvements in processing speed and power, have
functioned as a catalyst to allow for the base technologies required for
the advent of AI. The growing popularity of AI across many different
industries has attracted venture capital investment up to \$5 billion in
2016 alone.6 Much of the current attention on AI has focused on the four
core subfields introduced below. Machine Learning **[Machine learning
(ML) enables machines to learn and make predictions by recognizing
patterns]{.underline}**. Traditional computer programs are explicitly
programmed with a desired behavior (e.g. when the user clicks an icon, a
new program opens). ML allows a computer to utilize partial labelling of
the data (supervised learning) or the structure detected in the data
itself (unsupervised learning) to explain or make predictions about the
data without explicit programming (Figure 1). Supervised learning is
useful for training a ML algorithm to predict a known result or outcome
while unsupervised learning is useful in searching for patterns within
data.7 A third category within machine learning is reinforcement
learning, where a program attempts to accomplish a task (e.g. driving a
car, inferring medical decisions) while learning from its own successes
and mistakes.8 One can conceptualize reinforcement learning as the
computer science equivalent of operant conditioning9 and is useful for
automated tuning of predictions or actions, such as controlling an
artificial pancreas system to fine tune the measurement and delivery of
insulin to diabetic patients.10 ML is particularly useful for
identifying subtle patterns in large datasets -- patterns that may be
imperceptible to humans performing manual analyses -- by employing
techniques that allow for more indirect and complex non-linear
relationships and multivariate effects than conventional statistical
analysis.11,12 ML has outperformed logistic regression for prediction of
surgical site infections (SSI) by building non-linear models that
incorporate multiple data sources, including diagnoses, treatments, and
laboratory values.13 Furthermore, multiple algorithms working together
(ensemble ML) can be used to calculate predictions at accuracy levels
thought to be unattainable with conventional statistics.14 For example,
by analyzing patterns of diagnostic and therapeutic data (including
surgical resection) in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results
(SEER) cancer registry and comparing data to Medicare claims, ensemble
ML with random forests, neural networks, and lasso regression was able
to predict patient lung cancer staging by using International
Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 claims data alone with 93%
sensitivity, 92% specificity, and 93% accuracy, outperforming a decision
tree approach based on clinical guidelines alone (53% sensitivity, 89%
specificity, 72% accuracy).15 Natural Language Processing **[Natural
language processing (NLP) is a subfield that emphasizes building a
computer's ability to understand human language and is crucial for large
scale analyses of content such as electronic medical record (EMR)
data]{.underline}**, especially physicians' narrative documentation. To
achieve human-level understanding of language, successful NLP systems
must expand beyond simple word recognition to incorporate semantics and
syntax into their analyses.16 Rather than relying on codified
classifications such as ICD codes, NLP enables machines to infer meaning
and sentiment from unstructured data (e.g. prose written in the history
of present illness or in a physician's assessment and plan). NLP allows
clinicians to write more naturally rather than having to input specific
text sequences or select from menus to allow a computer to recognize the
data. NLP has been utilized for large scale database analysis of the EMR
to detect adverse events and postoperative complications from physician
documentation17, 18, and many EMR systems now incorporate NLP -- for
example, to achieve automated claims coding -- into their underlying
software architecture to improve workflow or billing.19 In surgical
patients, NLP has been used to automatically comb through EMRs to
identify words and phrases in operative reports and progress notes that
predicted anastomotic leak after colorectal resections. Many of its
predictions reflected simple clinical knowledge that a surgeon would
have (e.g. operation type and difficulty), but the algorithm was also
able to adjust predictive weights of phrases describing patients (e.g.
irritated, tired) relative to the postoperative day to achieve
predictions of leak with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 72%.20
The ability of algorithms to self-correct can increase the utility of
their predictions as datasets grow to become more representative of a
patient population. Artificial Neural Networks **[Artificial neural
networks, a subfield of ML, are inspired by biological nervous systems
and have become of paramount importance in many AI
applications.]{.underline}** Neural networks process signals in layers
of simple computational units (neurons); connections between neurons are
then parameterized via weights that change as the network learns
different input-output maps corresponding to tasks such as pattern/image
recognition and data classification (Figure 2).7 Deep learning networks
are neural networks comprised of many layers and are able to learn more
complex and subtle patterns than simple one or two-layer neural
networks.21 Clinically, ANNs have significantly outperformed more
traditional risk prediction approaches. For example, an ANN's
sensitivity (89%) and specificity (96%) outperformed APACHE II
sensitivity (80%) and specificity (85%) for prediction of pancreatitis
severity six hours after admission.22 By using clinical variables such
as patient history, medications, blood pressure, and length of stay,
ANNs, in combination with other ML approaches, have yielded predictions
of in-hospital mortality after open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair
with sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 96.1%, and accuracy of 95.4%.23
Computer Vision **[Computer vision describes machine understanding of
images and videos, and significant advances have resulted in machines
achieving human-level capabilities in areas such as object and scene
recognition.]{.underline}**24 Important healthcare-related work in
computer vision includes image acquisition and interpretation in axial
imaging with applications including computer-aided diagnosis,
image-guided surgery, and virtual colonoscopy.25 Initially influenced by
statistical signal processing, the field has recently shifted
significantly towards more data-intensive ML approaches, such as neural
networks,26 with adaptation into new applications. Utilizing ML
approaches, current work in computer vision is focusing on higher level
concepts such as image-based analysis of patient cohorts, longitudinal
studies, and inference of more subtle conditions such as decision-making
in surgery. For example, real-time analysis of laparoscopic video has
yielded 92.8% accuracy in automated identification of the steps of a
sleeve gastrectomy and noted missing or unexpected steps.27 With one
minute of high-definition surgical video estimated to contain 25 times
the amount of data found in a high-resolution computed tomography
image28, video could contain a wealth of actionable data.29, 30 Thus,
while predictive video analysis is in its infancy, such work provides
proofof-concept that AI can be leveraged to process massive amounts of
surgical data to identify or predict adverse events in real-time for
intraoperative clinical decision support (Figure 3).

Defining biotechnology poses challenges, for the word is less a
tightly-defined, technical

term than a loose umbrella category, or even a slogan, that conveys---
sometimes simultaneously---visions of unbounded progress and unregulated
tampering with nature. Many authors have tried to capture biotechnology
within their own well-crafted definitions, but these attempts cannot
neatly contain this expanding network of activities and its increasingly
dense connections to diverse social worlds. Although the word has a long
history (Bud 1993), in most contemporary contexts **[biotechnology

[The colon introduces]{.underline} the following: a.  A list, but only

an appositive: Each scout will carry the following: (colon) meals for
three days, a survival knife, and his sleeping bag. The company had four
new officers: (colon) Bill Smith, Frank Tucker, Peter Fillmore, and

story from the one you learned in school. There have been many versions
of that battle \[Gettysburg\] and that war \[the Civil War\]. (The quote
continues for two more paragraphs.) c. A formal quotation or question:
The President declared: (colon) \"The only thing we have to fear is fear
itself.\" The question is: (colon) what can we do about it? d. A second
independent clause which explains the first: Potter\'s motive is clear:
(colon) he wants the assignment. e. After the introduction of a business

Pardon me if I turn to a source besides Bill. [American Heritage
Dictionary: Resolve]{.underline}: 1. To make a firm decision about. 2.
To decide or express by formal vote. 3. To separate something into
constiutent parts See Syns at \*analyze\* (emphasis in orginal) 4. Find
a solution to. See Syns at \*Solve\* (emphasis in original) 5. To
dispel: resolve a doubt. - n 1. Firmness of purpose; resolution. 2. [A
determination or decision]{.underline}. (2) The very nature of the word
\"resolution\" makes it a question. American Heritage: A course of
action determined or decided on. A formal statement of a decision, as by
a legislature. (3) The resolution is obviously a question. Any other
conclusion is utterly inconceivable. Why? Context. The debate community
empowers a topic committee to write a topic for ALTERNATE side debating.
The committee is not a random group of people coming together to
\"reserve\" themselves about some issue. There is context - they are
empowered by a community to do something. In their deliberations, the
topic community attempts to craft a resolution which can be ANSWERED in
either direction. They focus on issues like ground and fairness because
they know the resolution will serve as the basis for debate which will
be resolved by determining the policy desirablility of that resolution.
That\'s not only what they do, but it\'s what we REQUIRE them to do. We
don\'t just send the topic committee somewhere to adopt their own group
resolution. It\'s not the end point of a resolution adopted by a body -
it\'s the preliminary wording of a resolution sent to others to be
answered or decided upon. (4) Further context: the word [resolved is
used to emphasis the fact that it\'s policy debate. Resolved comes from
the adoption of resolutions by legislative bodies]{.underline}. A
resolution is either adopted or it is not. [It\'s a question before a
legislative body]{.underline}. Should this statement be adopted or not.
(5) The very terms \'affirmative\' and \'negative\' support my view. One
affirms a resolution. Affirmative and negative are the equivalents of
\'yes\' or \'no\' - which, of course, are answers to a question.

California Polytechnic U., et al., The Debater's Guide, Third Edition,
p. 4

The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action In policy propositions,
[each topic contains certain key elements]{.underline}, although they
have slightly different functions from comparable elements of
value-oriented propositions[. 1. An agent doing the acting \-\--"The
United States" in "The United States should adopt]{.underline} a policy
of free trade." Like the object of evaluation in a proposition of value,
[the agent is the subject of the sentence. 2. The verb
*should*]{.underline}---the first part of a verb phrase [that urges
action]{.underline}. 3. An action verb to follow should in the
should-verb combination. [For example, *should adopt*]{.underline} here
**[means to put a]{.underline}** program or **[policy into action though
governmental means]{.underline}**. 4. A specification of directions or a
limitation of the action desired. The phrase free trade, for example,
gives direction and limits to the topic, which would, for example,
eliminate consideration of increasing tariffs, discussing diplomatic
recognition, or discuscsing interstate commerce. Propositions of policy
deal with future action. Nothing has yet occurred. [The **entire
debate** is about whether something ought to occur.]{.underline} What
you agree to do, then, when you accept the affirmative side in such a
debate is to offer sufficient and compelling reasons for an audience to
perform the future action that you propose.

**Turner and Avison,** **'92** -- Harvie Branscomb Chair and Professor
of Sociology, Professor of Psychiatry at Vanderbilt and Professor of
Sociology at Western (R. Jay and William R. "Innovations in the
Measurement of Life Stress: Crisis Theory and the Significance of Event
Resolution," Journal of Health and Social Behavior, Vol. 33, No. 1
(Mar., 1992), pp. 36-50)

Erikson's (1959) formulation emphasizes the individual's constant and
active inter- course with the environment as crucial for development.
Problems are encountered and resolved, with varying degrees of success.
[Erikson's use of the term resolved]{.underline} or resolution in
describing a successful crisis outcome [does not seem to imply that the
issue is solved]{.underline} or [cleared up.]{.underline} Rather, [it
refers to a temporary or- enduring positive decision or settling in
relation to the personal meanings of the event.]{.underline} For
Erikson, [a positive balance is achieved between alternative self
attitudes that are experienced as senses of how and who one
is.]{.underline} The criteria for these senses are "a crisis, beset with
fears, or at least a general anxiousness or tension, seems to be
resolved, in that the child suddenly seems to 'grow together' both
psychologically and physi- cally" (Erikson 1959, p. 75). [When resolved,
the individual may emerge from these engagements with a new skill,
conﬁdence, or other enabling self attitude that is added to his or her
repertoire of responses or coping mechanisms.]{.underline} This then
increases the probabil- ity of success in future encounters. [The
developmental process thus may involve a synthesizing of new experiences
into an evolving self perception and/or the accumulation of skills or
strategies for instrumental or emotional response.]{.underline} While
[Erikson]{.underline} speciﬁcally [used the term "vulnerability" to
characterize the major corollary of crisis experiences, he implies a
meaning that might better be described as]{.underline}
openness-[openness to both harm and enhancement.]{.underline} This is
evident from his contention that personality growth occurs through the
resolution of normative crises and hence that the disequilibria which
characterize these crises offer potential for forward developmental
leaps as well as vulnerability.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States)**

[The government of the United States of America is the federal
government]{.underline} of the constitutional republic of fifty states
that constitute the United States, as well as one capital district, and
several other territories. [The federal government is composed of three
distinct branches: legislative, executive and judicia]{.underline}l,
[whose powers are vested]{.underline} by the U.S. Constitution [in the
Congress, the President, and the federal courts]{.underline}, including
the Supreme Court, respectively; [the powers and duties of these
branches are further defined by acts of Congress]{.underline}, including
the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme
Court.¶ The full name of the republic is \"The United States of
America\". No other name appears in the Constitution, and this is the
name that appears on money, in treaties, and in legal cases to which it
is a party (e.g., Charles T. Schenck v. United States). [The
terms]{.underline} \"Government of the United States of America\" or
\"United States Government\" are often used in official documents to
[represent the federal government as distinct from the
states]{.underline} collectively. In casual conversation or writing, the
term \"Federal Government\" is often used, and the term \"National
Government\" is sometimes used. The terms \"Federal\" and \"National\"
in government agency or program names generally indicates affiliation
with the federal government (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation,
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, etc.). Because the seat
of government is in Washington, D.C., \"Washington\" is commonly used as
a metonym for the federal government.

not exercise power not delegated by the Constitution. All power not
delegated to the United States by the Constitution is reserved to the
several States within their respective territorial borders, or to the
people. However, [Congress is solely responsible for governing territory
belonging to the United States]{.underline}. This authority is conferred

## Should

### Should -- Enact a plan

#### Should denotes an expectation of enacting a plan

**American Heritage Dictionary 2000** (Dictionary.com)

should. [The will to do something]{.underline} or have something take
place: I shall go out if I feel like it.

### Should -- Mandatory

#### "Should" is mandatory

**Nieto 9** -- Judge Henry Nieto, Colorado Court of Appeals, 8-20-2009
People v. Munoz, 240 P.3d 311 (Colo. Ct. App. 2009)

\"[Should\" is \"used . . . to express duty, obligation]{.underline},
propriety, or expediency.\" Webster\'s Third New International
Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts \[\*\*15\] interpreting the word in
various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions, although [the
**weight of authority** appears to favor interpreting \"should\" in an
**imperative, obligatory sense**]{.underline}. HN7A number of courts,
confronted with the question of whether using the word \"should\" in
jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth Amendment
protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have upheld
instructions using the word. [In the courts of other states]{.underline}
in which a defendant has argued that the word \"should\" in the
reasonable doubt instruction does not sufficiently inform the jury that
it is bound to find the defendant not guilty if insufficient proof is
submitted at trial, the courts have squarely rejected the argument. They
reasoned that [the word \"conveys a sense of duty and obligation and
**could not be misunderstood**]{.underline} by a jury.\" See State v.
McCloud, 257 Kan. 1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan. 1995); see also Tyson v.
State, 217 Ga. App. 428, 457 S.E.2d 690, 691-92 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995)
(finding argument that \"should\" is directional but not instructional
to be without merit); Commonwealth v. Hammond, 350 Pa. Super. 477, 504
A.2d 940, 941-42 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1986). Notably, [courts interpreting
the word \"should]{.underline}\" in other types of jury instructions
\[\*\*16\] [have]{.underline} also [found that the word
conveys]{.underline} to the jury [a sense of duty or obligation and
**not discretion**]{.underline}. In Little v. State, 261 Ark. 859, 554
S.W.2d 312, 324 (Ark. 1977), [the Arkansas Supreme Court interpreted the
word \"should\"]{.underline} in an instruction on circumstantial
evidence [as **synonymous with the word \"must\"**]{.underline} and
rejected the defendant\'s argument that the jury may have been misled by
the court\'s use of the word in the instruction. Similarly, [the
Missouri Supreme Court rejected a defendant\'s argument that the court
erred by not using the word \"should\" in an instruction]{.underline} on
witness credibility [which used the word \"must\" because the two words
have the **same meaning**]{.underline}. State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211,
215 (Mo. 1958). \[\*318\] In applying a child support statute, [the
Arizona Court]{.underline} of Appeals [concluded that a legislature\'s
or commission\'s use of the word \"should\" is meant to convey **duty**
or **obligation**]{.underline}. McNutt v. McNutt, 203 Ariz. 28, 49 P.3d
300, 306 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002) (finding a statute stating that child
support expenditures \"should\" be allocated for the purpose of
parents\' federal tax exemption to be mandatory).

####  "Should" means must -- its mandatory

**Foresi 32** (Remo Foresi v. Hudson Coal Co., Superior Court of
Pennsylvania, 106 Pa. Super. 307; 161 A. 910; 1932 Pa. Super. LEXIS 239,
7-14, Lexis)

[As regards the mandatory character of the rule, the word
\'should\']{.underline} is not only an auxiliary verb, it
[is]{.underline} also [the preterite of the verb, \'shall\' and has for
one of its meanings as]{.underline} defined in the Century Dictionary:
\"[Obliged or compelled (to); would have (to); must; ought (to); used
with an infinitive]{.underline} (without to) [to express obligation,
necessity or duty in connection with some act yet to be carried
out.\"]{.underline} We think it clear that it is in that sense that the
word \'should\' is used in this rule, not merely advisory. When the
judge in charging the jury tells them that, unless they find from all
the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is guilty of
the offense charged, they should acquit[, the word \'should\' is **not
used in an advisory sense** but has the force or meaning of \'must\', or
\'ought to\' and carries]{.underline} \[\*\*\*8\] [with it the sense
of]{.underline} \[\*313\] [obligation and duty equivalent to
**compulsion**]{.underline}. A natural sense of sympathy for a few
unfortunate claimants who have been injured while doing something in
direct violation of law must not be so indulged as to fritter away, or
nullify, provisions which have been enacted to safeguard and protect the
welfare of thousands who are engaged in the hazardous occupation of
mining.

The answer to this query is not to be divined from rules of

it must be governed by the age-old practice culture of legal
professionals and its immemorial language usage. To determine if the
omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, \"and
the same hereby is\", (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an
expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2)
constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the
trial judge\'s intent must be garnered from the four corners of the

those for choosing between shall and will have long been advanced for
should and would, but again the rules have had little effect on usage.
In most constructions, would is the auxiliary chosen regardless of the
person of the subject: If our allies would support the move, we would
abandon any claim to sovereignty. You would be surprised at the
complexity of the directions. Because the main function of should in
modern American English is to express duty, necessity, etc. ( You should
get your flu shot before winter comes ), its use for other purposes, as
to form a subjunctive, can produce ambiguity, at least initially: I
should get my flu shot if I were you. Furthermore, should seems an
affectation to many Americans when used in certain constructions quite
common in British English: Had I been informed, I should (American would
) have called immediately. I should (American would ) really prefer a
different arrangement. As with shall and will, most educated native
speakers of American English do not follow the textbook rule in making a
choice between should and would. [See also shall.]{.underline} Shall

### Should -- Desirable

#### "Should" means desirable \-\-- this does not have to be a mandate

**AC 99** (Atlas Collaboration, "Use of Shall, Should, May Can,"
http://rd13doc.cern.ch/Atlas/DaqSoft/sde/inspect/shall.html)

shall

[\'shall\' describes something that is mandatory]{.underline}. If a
requirement uses \'shall\', then that requirement \_will\_ be satisfied
without fail. Noncompliance is not allowed. Failure to comply with one
single \'shall\' is sufficient reason to reject the entire product.
Indeed, it must be rejected under these circumstances. Examples: \#
\"Requirements shall make use of the word \'shall\' only where
compliance is mandatory.\" This is a good example. \# \"C++ code shall
have comments every 5th line.\" This is a bad example. Using \'shall\'
here is too strong.

should

[\'should\' is weaker. It describes something that might not be
satisfied in the final product, but that is desirable
enough]{.underline} that any noncompliance shall be explicitly
justified. Any use of \'should\' should be examined carefully, as it
probably means that something is not being stated clearly. If a
\'should\' can be replaced by a \'shall\', or can be discarded entirely,
so much the better. Examples: \# \"C++ code should be ANSI compliant.\"
A good example. It may not be possible to be ANSI compliant on all
platforms, but we should try. \# \"Code should be tested thoroughly.\"
Bad example. This \'should\' shall be replaced with \'shall\' if this
requirement is to be stated anywhere (to say nothing of defining what
\'thoroughly\' means).

#### "Should" doesn't require certainty

**Black's Law 79** (Black's Law Dictionary -- Fifth Edition, p. 1237)

[Should]{.underline}. The past tense of shall; ordinarily implying duty
or obligation; although usually no more than an obligation of propriety
or expediency, or a moral obligation, thereby distinguishing it from
"ought." It is not normally synonymous with "may," and although often
interchangeable with the word "would," it [**does not ordinarily express
certainty** as "will" sometimes does. ]{.underline}

## Its

#### Its is possessive and requires [ownership]{.underline}

**Glossary of English Grammar Terms, 2005**

(http://www.usingenglish.com/glossary/possessive-pronoun.html)

Mine, yours, his, hers, [[its]{.underline}]{.mark}, ours, theirs
[are]{.underline} the [[possessive pronouns]{.underline} [used
to]{.underline}]{.mark} substitute a noun [and to
[show]{.mark}]{.underline} possession or
[[ownership]{.mark}.]{.underline} EG. This is your disk and that\'s
mine. (Mine substitutes the word disk and shows that it belongs to me.)

#### "Its" means belonging to it 

**Oxford English Dictionary 14**
http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/its

Its

A. As adj. poss. pron. [[Of or belonging to it]{.underline}]{.mark}, or

## Topicality Impacts

### Topic Education

#### Simulating international agents is key to topic education. Literature consensus shows.

**Shellman and Turan 2006** \[Stephen M., and Kürşad Turan. \"Do
simulations enhance student learning? An empirical evaluation of an IR
simulation.\" *Journal of Political Science Education* 2, no. 1 (2006):
19-32.\]

Our simulation includes many international organizations such as the
World Bank, the UN Security Council, the Arab League, NATO, the European
Union, Amnesty International, etc. Most students are involved in or
connected to an inter- 285 national organization in some way or another,
whether it is indirectly through a mutual group international
organization representative or directly as the Secretary General of
NATO. By the end of the simulation we feel and the results infer that
students can identify with the problems international organizations
address, the processes that govern at least one of the organizations
included, and the constraints that 290 are placed on countries'
sovereignty. We find that **[[students also feel that the simulation
enhances knowledge of international organizations and their
processes.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In contrast, the modal value is equal
to four for theoretical enhancement. These results convey that **[[while
the simulation enhances knowledge in all three areas, it does a better
job enhancing the knowledge of concepts and organizations and
their]{.mark}]{.underline}** 295 **[[processes than IR
theories]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Perhaps assigning discussion papers and
asking more theoretically based questions during the debriefing could
bring this number up. Moreover, some of the theories we cover in class
have a domestic basis like Fearon's (1994) audience cost model and
Milner's (1997) domestic institutions and interest groups based
theoretical framework. The simulation, at the present time, unfortu- 300
nately lacks proper mechanisms to apply such theories to decisions,
processes, and outcomes and to analyze their utility. Thus, the
simulation constraints may explain why the modal value for theories is
four and not five. That said, overall, we find support that the
simulation enhances knowledge of substantive course material. The
results fit with Brown and King (2000) who find 305 that **[[students'
knowledge of international relations increases as a result of
participating in the International Communications and Negotiations
Simulations]{.underline}]{.mark}** (ICONS).12 Also relevant are the
results from Kumza and Haney (2001). They show that the use of film in a
U.S. Foreign Policy summer course to stimulate active learning works.
Using self-assessment surveys, Kumza and Haney (2001) show that
students' 310 increase their knowledge of U.S. foreign policy through
films, discussions, and written exercises. Our results are consistent
with those discussed above in that they support the hypothesis that
active learning exercises enhance learning. Both the modal and median
values calculated for country=organization enhancement are equal to
five. More than 90% of the students stated that the simu- 315 lation
enhanced knowledge of their assigned country or organization at a level
four or above on the five-point intensity scale. This finding is
consistent with Brown and King (2000) who found that participation in
ICONS enhanced knowledge of the country assigned and U.S. foreign
policy**[[. In a typical introductory international relations course,
professors rarely expose students to characteristics of
particular]{.underline}]{.mark}** 320 **[[countries and or their current
foreign policies. Our simulation forces students to research a
particular country's foreign policy or a particular international
organization's rules, history, and structure. In order to actively
engage in the exercise, one needs to know what to talk about, who to
talk to, and what to offer and not to offer in order to get what one
wants.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The research assignment can be eye-opening
to many 325 students who are unfamiliar with international relations,
particular countries, their foreign policies, and their regional
affairs. We infer from our data that the simulation enhances students'
knowledge of particular countries and=or organizations. In terms of
critical and analytical thinking skills, over 74% reported enhancement
levels at four or above for question 6. This supports the hypothesis
that our 330 simulation aids in the development of critical and
analytical thinking skills. Our simulation compels students to make
their own decisions and anticipate and=or react to the consequences. For
example, students in the past have created fake Yahoo e-mail accounts
using the instructor's name and have used it to gather information from
other groups. Another individual used her friendship with the head
terrorist's 335 roommate to acquire information about the terrorists
operations. These are some of the more intelligent and sneaky tactics
students innovate and implement during the simulation. The students
ultimately create solutions to resolve international problems given
constraints placed on their countries and organizations. These are
skills that are difficult to teach by reading and lecturing. Rather, we
argue that simulation 340 is the best method for teaching such skills,
because students are confronted with novel problems and they are forced
to experiment with strategies and tactics to accomplish them. Then, they
are able to learn from their successes as well as their failures. Our
finding is consistent with Leonard and Leonard (1995) who found that
business school graduates believed courses involving simulation
exercises prepared 345 them better for their future jobs than courses
that only used case methods. We want to produce professionals in all
fields who can analyze and solve novel problems, and the survey results
suggest that our simulation develops these skills.

#### Standard -- Clarity

Myshak 2018 Elena. \"DEFINITION OF THE TERM
"BIOTECHNOLOGY".\" *Cogito-Multidisciplinary research Journal* 4 (2018):
142-149.

As we can see from a small number of examples, the term biotechnology is
by no means unambiguous, and the reason lies not only in the difference
in the wording and its prevalence, but also in the selection of the
relevant features of the concept when creating the definition. In most
of the definitions, the definition is based on the use of living
organisms or their components for the production of products designed to
improve the quality of life of people. Other definitions emphasize that
biotechnology is a technology that combines biology and technology that
uses biological systems, living organisms or their fragments to develop
or create various products. In almost all definitions, the idea of the
benefits of biotechnology is expressed, namely: biotechnology is used to
obtain useful products for society with the help of biological agents of
microorganisms, viruses, animal and plant cells; creating useful
products (from drugs to industrial enzymes); to improve plants or
animals; to solve engineering and industrial problems, etc. It should be
noted that almost all definitions have a different nuclear seme or genus
and species trait: science (science); technology; manipulation;
techniques; use; area. Such differences in the definition of the key
term of the biotechnology sphere confirm the proposition that the
definitions of concepts in any science are temporary and, depending on
the development of the latter, can be transformed. So, **[[in the
presented examples of the definition of one term "biotechnology", we
tried to demonstrate the diversity of definitional variations of the
term in its static (vocabulary) manifestation at the initial stage of
the formation of terminology,]{.underline}]{.mark}** i.e. on the way to
the formation of the term system. **[[This fact indicates the dynamic
structure of the term, the development of the denotation, the concept
and signification. The terminology of biotechnology is not fully formed
and needs to be standardized in order to provide the recipient with
information about the concept reflected in the
definition.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### Switching Sides Good

#### Switch Side Debate builds critical thinking skills which are key to foster democratic values and prevent extinction. 

**Harrigan 08 \[(Casey, Master of Arts in the Department of
Communications at Wake Forest University) "A Defense of Switch Side
Debate", 2008,
<http://wakespace.lib.wfu.edu/bitstream/handle/10339/14746/harrigancd_05_2008.pdf>\]**

While such pragmatic justifications for SSD are persuasive, they are
admittedly secondary to the greater consideration of pedagogy. Although
it is certainly true that debate is a game and that its competitive
elements are indispensable sources of motivation for students who are
otherwise apathetic about academic endeavors, **[the overwhelming
benefits of contest debating are the knowledge and skills taught through
participation. The wins and losses (and marginally-cheesy
trophies)]{.underline}**, by and large, are quickly forgotten with the
passage of time**[. However, the educational values of debate are so
fundamental that they eventually become ingrained in the decision-making
and thought processes of debaters, giving them a uniquely valuable
durability. To this end, SSD is essential.]{.underline}** The benef its
of debating both sides have been noted by many authors over the past
fifty years. To name but a few, **[SSD has been lauded for fostering
tolerance and undermining bigotry and dogmatism]{.underline}** (M uir,
1993), **[creating stronger and more knowledgeable
advocates]{.underline}** (Dybvig and Iversion, 2000) , **[and fortifying
the social forces of democracy by guaranteeing the expression of
minority viewpoints]{.underline}** (Day, 1966). **[Switching sides is a
crucial element of debate's pedagogical benefit; it forms the gears that
drive debate's intellectual motor. Additionally, there are social
benefits to the practice of requiring students to debate both sides of
controversial issues.]{.underline}** Dating back to th e Greek
rhetorical tradition, **[great value has been placed on the benefit of
testing each argument relative to all others in the marketplace of
ideas.]{.underline}** Like those who argue on behalf of the
efficiency-maximizing benefits of free market competition, it is
believed that **[arguments are most rigorously tested (and conceivably
refined and improved) when compared to all available alternatives. Even
for beliefs that have seem ingly been ingrained in consensus opinion or
7 in cases where the public at-large is unlikely to accept a particular
position, it has been argued that they should remain open for public
discussion and deliberation]{.underline}** (Mill, 1975). **[Along these
lines, the greatest benefit of switching sides, which goes to the heart
of contemporary debate, is its inducement of critical
thinking]{.underline}**. Defined as "reasonable reflective thinking that
is focused on decidi ng what to believe or do" (Ennis, 1987, p. 10),
**[critical thinking learned through debate teaches students not just
how to advocate and argue, but how to decide as well. Each and every
student, whether in debate or (more likely) at some later point in life,
will be placed in the position of the decision-maker. Faced with
competing options whose costs and benefits are initially unclear,
critical thinking is necessary to assess all the possible outcomes of
each choice, compare their relative merits, and arrive at some final
decision about which is preferable.]{.underline}** In some instances,
such as choosing whether to eat Chinese or Indian food for dinner, the
im portance of making the correct decision is minor. For many other de
cisions, however, the implications of choosing an imprudent course of
action are pot entially grave. As Robert Crawford notes, there are
"issues of unsurpassed importance in the daily lives of millions upon
millions of people\...being decided to a considerable extent by the
power of pub lic speaking" (2003). Although the days of the Cold War are
over, and the risk that "the next Pearl Harbor could be 'compounded by
hydrogen'" (Ehninger and Brockriede, 1978, p. 3) is greatly reduced,
**[the manipulation of public support before the invasion of Iraq in
2003 points to the continuing necessity of training a well-in formed and
critically-aware public]{.underline}** (Zarefsky, 2007). **[In the
absence of debate-trained critical thinking, ignorant but ambitious
politicians and persuasive but nefarious leaders would be much more
likely to draw the country, and possibly the world, in to conflicts with
incalculable losses in terms of human 8 well-being. Given the myriad
threats of global proportions th at will require incisive solutions,
including global warming, the spread of pandemic diseases, and the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, cultivating a robust and
effective society of critical decision-makers is
essential.]{.underline}** As Louis Rene Beres writes, "with such
learning, we Americans could prepare\...not as immobilized objects of
false contentment, but as authentic citizens of an endangered planet"
(2003 ). Thus, it is not surprising that critical thinking has been
called "the highest edu cational goal of the ac tivity" (Parcher, 1998).
**[While arguing from conviction can foster limited critical thinking
skills, the element of switching sides is necessary to sharpen debate's
critical edge and ensure that decisions are made in a reasoned manner
instead of being driven by ideology. Debaters trained in SSD are more
likely to evaluate both sides of an argument before arriving at a
conclusion and are less likely to dismiss potential arguments based on
his or her prior beliefs]{.underline}** (Muir 1993). In addition,
debating both sides teaches "conceptual flexibility," where
decision-makers are more likely to refl ect upon the beliefs that are
held before coming to a final opinion (Muir, 1993, p. 290) . Exposed to
many arguments on each side of an issue, debaters learn that public
policy is characteri zed by extraordinary complexity that requires
careful consideration before action. **[Finally, these arguments are
confirmed by the preponderance of empirical research demonstrating a
link between competitive SSD and critical thinking]{.underline}**
(Allen, Berkow itz, Hunt and Louden, 1999; Colbert, 2002, p. 82). The
theory and practice of SSD has value beyond the limited realm of
competitive debate as well. For the practitioners a nd students of
rhetoric, understanding how individuals come to form opini ons about
subjects and then a ttempt to persuade others is 9 of utmost importance.
Although the field of communication has established models that attempt
to explain human decision-making, such as the Rational Argumentation
Theory and others (Cragen and Shields, 1998, p. 66) , the practice of
SSD within competitive debate rounds is a real-world laboratory wh ere
argumentative experiments are carried out thousands of times over during
the course of a single year-long season. **[The theory of SSD has
profound implications for those who study how individuals are persuaded,
as well as how advocates should go about the process of forming their
own personal beliefs and attempting to persuade others.]{.underline}**

### Reasonability/Competing Interps 

#### Use reasonability it ensures access to the 1AC and prevents teams from arbitrarily going for T to exclude Affs solidly grounded in lit. 

**Ryan '4**

(Andrew B. Ryan, college debater, Wake Forest University, 2004, Reviving
Reasonability. The Debaters' Research Guide, 2004.
groups.wfu.edu/debate)

How should the affirmative initiate a discussion about the quality of
debate? [First]{.underline}, start by defending your own ground. [The
resolution gives both teams a reasonable expectation of what is topical
and affirmatives choose their plan accordingly. The affirmative has a
qualified right to their reasonable expectation of the
topic]{.underline}: how can affirmatives choose plans if they cannot
rely on definitions they have researched that support its topicality?
This right isn't unlimited, however, because the negative is encouraged
to debate the affirmative on whether their interpretation of words is
supported by grammar, common usage, field context, etc. [But, the
negative's right to re-interpret the topic should be limited to
consistent and predictable interpretations. Resorting to arbitrary
interpretations based on illogical catchphrases unfairly allows the
negative to pull the rug out from under the affirmative.
Second]{.underline}, affirmatives should talk about what makes a good
definition. Are dictionary definitions best? Possibly, as long as you
are not dealing with a term of art, such as peacekeeping. What about
field context? Shouldn't a definition of peacekeeping by the head of
U.N. Peacekeeping Operations be given more weight than a dictionary
definition? Lastly, [defining a word in a certain way may be the only
way to maintain the grammatical integrity of the resolution. Take the
discussion of definitions to another level: move past superficial
quantitative discussions of limits and speak directly to the educational
benefits and disadvantages of each side's definition.]{.underline}
[Third]{.underline}, don't be afraid to talk about debate's purpose. It
is a competitive game, but one that should always be based on reason and
logic. [If what a team does enables illogical arguments to determine the
outcome of the debate, then regardless of what unlimited topic the
affirmative may allow, it is still better to vote affirmative than
eschew reason.]{.underline} [Reasonability is important because strict
adherence to comparing competing interpretations based on
offense/defense types of theories allows the negative to the make the
perfect the enemy of the good.]{.underline} [Fourth]{.underline}, a
reasonability paradigm would help affirmatives to redefine the role of
the judge. [One of the central negative objections to reasonability
interpretations is that they encourage judge intervention because the
judge is left without a coherent standard to determine which
interpretations are best. Affirmatives can flip this
argument]{.underline} on the negative, however, by arguing that the
offense/defense and competing interpretations paradigm exceeds the
jurisdictional role of the judge. Traditionally, negatives argued that
jurisdiction was a voting issue because judges could not vote to endorse
a non-topical affirmative. [The neg]{.underline}ative age [calls for a
judge to act as an arbiter of competing interpretations. That exceeds
the role of the judge, however, because the negative is no longer
demonstrating the affirmative is non-topical; rather they are only
demonstrating that an interpretation that excludes the affirmative is
comparatively better for debate.]{.underline} Topicality is a gateway
issue which is meant to ensure that both sides have adequate ground for
debate: if both interpretations provide similar quantity and quality of
ground, then judges should dispense with topicality and allow the policy
debate to begin.

#### Reject the argument, not the team

DRGArticles/DRGArtiarticlesIndex.htm)

[First, the attempt to achieve favorable time tradeoffs is a ubiquitous
practice in current debate.]{.underline} It is behind the practice of
making multiple answers to a given argument. It strongly influences the
number of positions the negative team will advance in the 1NC. It is
behind the decision to start all of the major negative positions in the
1NC. It dictates how many positions will be extended through the block.
It generally controls the decision about whether or not the affirmative
should "straight turn" one or more disadvantages. Even [the employment
of punishment arguments is generally based on the desire to secure a
favorable time exchange. It seems silly to single out a few particular
instances of this universal practices and say that they are voting
issues, when the whole of debate is saturated with strategic time
considerations. Second, forcing teams to make strategic choices does
have educational value. Debaters are forced to judge which their best
arguments are and be selective about what they will extend.
Third,]{.underline} punishment arguments constitute a self-inflicted
coverage injury. [It takes time,]{.underline} sometimes considerable
time, [to argue that a certain approach has distorted your time
allocation. If debaters didn't defend punishment, they would have more
time to answer other arguments. Fourth, time skews are often minimal. It
is quite common for an issue which occupied literally seconds of the
debate to still be tagged as a voting issue.]{.underline} In cases like
this, [the]{.underline} overall [integrity of the round
would]{.underline} certainly [be maximized by simply rejecting the
particular argument rather than the team]{.underline} that made it.
[Fifth, teams defending a problematic theory]{.underline} almost [always
invest]{.underline} some [time in advancing that position]{.underline}
and in extending it. [Time spent answering the time skew argument serves
to redress the injury. Sixth, there are other means of redress rather
than the ballot.]{.underline} If some other issue was radically
undercovered due to the alleged time skew[, the judge could allow new
answers on that issue.]{.underline} Finally, [seventh, time skew
arguments directed against the affirmative seem especially dubious. The
structure of the debate places particular time pressures on the
affirmative. The luxury of the negative block should give the negative
ample time to answer pretty much whatever the 2AC says.]{.underline}
(New 1AR answers do pose a different and more legitimate concern from
the standpoint of time allocation issues.)

#### Default to reasonability competing interpretations compromises substantive discussion -- 6 warrants 

**Solt '2**

(Roger E. Solt, Debate Coach at the University of Kentucky, "Theory as a
Voting Issue: The Crime of Punishment", 2002 - Mental Health Policies:
Escape from Bedlam?, 2002, http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/

DRGArticles/DRGArtiarticlesIndex.htm)

The [first]{.underline} main argument I would make against
[punishment]{.underline} is that it [exaggerates theory.]{.underline}
One view of debate is that it is just a game and that theory is as
worthwhile to debate as anything else. In contrast is the view that I
would defend: that [debate has]{.underline} a s[ubstantive intellectual
content which it is far more worthwhile to learn about than it is to
learn about debate theory.]{.underline} Debate teaches us a great deal
about current events and principles of policy analysis, about political
theory, political philosophy, and practical politics, about medicine and
law, ethics and epistemology. It teaches both problem solving and the
criticism of underlying assumptions. And it teaches many other things as
well. People disagree about which of these areas of inquiry is most
important, but any and all of these subjects are of more intrinsic
significance than debate theory. I write this as someone who finds
debate theory interesting. Nor do I think that we can get along without
debate theory. Nor should we. Theory is basically a set of
meta-arguments, arguments about arguments and about the standards for
argument. We could set these standards by authoritative edict (a
rulebook) or by convention. But on many theory questions there is
widespread disagreement and hence no dominant convention. And in the
absence of a prevailing convention there is unlikely to be an
authoritative rulebook which could be adopted or accepted. We have come,
over the past quarter of a century, to think that these are things which
debaters can and should argue about. And I accept this general outlook.
But even if we neither want to nor can entirely avoid theory argument,
it should not be a central focus of the activity. Yet this is precisely
what punishment argument make it. Rather than the criteria for the
evaluation of arguments, theories come to be ends in themselves, the
pivotal issues on which the debate centrally turns. This seems
misguided. [The knowledge gained in debate has many uses in later life,
but surely the least useful body of knowledge which debate teaches is
debate theory.]{.underline} For those of us who stay in the activity for
a long time, it is interesting. We want to sort out in a consistent and
satisfying way the principles of our activity. But that still does not
make it a very intrinsically important body of knowledge. I think that
we sometimes confuse debate theory with argument theory. I am not
arguing that argumentation is not a valid and useful field of thought.
And argument theory may intersect with what we commonly think of as
"debate theory" at a variety of points. But the vast bulk of debate
theory, as argued in competitive debate rounds, really just involves
what are appropriate conventions for this particular activity---a
contest, sponsored by educational institutions, with a certain format
and certain conventions. Are conditional counterplans legitimate? Are
plan inclusive counterplans legitimate? Are international counterplans
legitimate? Should we assume that the "fiat" of the affirmative plan
comes immediately or only after a normal implementation process? Must
the affirmative specify an agent? These are the staples of debate theory
argument. Especially they are the kinds of issues which most invoke
punishment claims. And none of them has particular salience outside the
framework and format of contest debate. Of course, it is possible to
relate some of these arguments to intellectual controversies beyond
competitive debate. For example, a focus on international institutions
distinguishes liberalism from realism as foreign policy paradigms. But
the debate over international fiat does not draw very heavily on this
paradigmatic controversy. And our arguments within competitive debate
over the propriety of international fiat does next to nothing to
illuminate the liberalism/realism debate within international relations.
Arguments over debate theory are reminiscent of the debates of the
medieval scholastic philosophers. Rather than arguing about how many
angels can dance on the head of pin, we argue about how many
intrinsicness arguments can dance on the head of a conditional
counterplan. To Aquinas and company, the relationship of pins and angels
was interesting and meaningful. Questions of fiat and conditionality
matter to us. But only within the narrower confines of the academic
debate activity. Once you leave debate, these issues won't matter to
you. So if the focus on punishment serves to make these kinds of
arguments more central and other, more exportable forms of knowledge
more marginal, then punishment does an intellectual disservice to the
students debate is intended to teach. My [second]{.underline} main
argument is that, [empirically, punishment arguments]{.underline}
[produce bad, anti-educational debate.]{.underline} Punishment arguments
are almost always made badly. [They are simply tag lines, especially at
the impact level.]{.underline} ("This is a voting issue for reasons of
fairness and education.") There are two dominant incentives for labeling
an objection to a given theory or practice a voting issue. The first is
the "cheap shot" motive. The "independent voter" may get lost in the
shuffle, and you may come out with an easy win. I doubt that anyone
really thinks that this process of learning to "out tech" your opponent
is an important part of debate's educational mission. Second, by
labeling an argument a voting issue, debaters hope of secure a favorable
time tradeoff. If an argument is a voting issue, it has to be taken more
seriously, even if it is not intrinsically of much substantive
importance. Again, in this instance, [the punishment argument serves as
an element in the tactics of time tradeoff.]{.underline} This is part of
the debate game, but it is not a very important part of what debate
should teach. As extended, punishment arguments again tend to be a
series of tag lines. This is generally true in the negative block, and
it is almost always true (because of intense time pressures) in the 1AR
and 2NR. If the 2AR chooses to go for a punishment argument, s/he may be
more articulate and explanatory. But this generally means that a lot of
new arguments are being made, or at least being given flesh from the
bare skeleton of assertion, and this raises fairness concerns of its
own. Of course, some theory debates are better than others. And I can
imagine a world in which theory is debated more clearly and coherently
than it generally is in the world of contemporary debate. But the
experience of a quarter century of theory debates does not encourage me
to think that we will enter that Promised Land any time soon. And
["better" theory debates would have to occur in a more thorough and
time-consuming fashion than those which occur today.]{.underline} And
this would exaggerate the problem of diverting time from more
substantive intellectual concerns. My [third]{.underline} argument is
that the punishment of [voting on theory is]{.underline} almost always
[disproportionate.]{.underline} To me this seems almost true by
definition. [Someone advances a "bad" argument. They lose that
argument.]{.underline} It is not a decisive argument in terms of the
substantive logic of the debate, be that a policy logic, a discursive
logic, or a critical logic. But [instead of just losing that argument,
with whatever logical, limited impact that may have in the round, the
team which advanced the "bad" argument suddenly is supposed to lose the
whole debate.]{.underline} In other words, [every other issue in the
round]{.underline}, all of the policy arguments, all of the critical
arguments, all of the discursive arguments become moot. They [no longer
matter and they need not be resolved because one theory argument has
been lost. Beyond my intuitive sense that this is disproportionate, I
have two other arguments for why voting on theory is excessive. First,
the theories debaters most want to punish are not really that
egregious.]{.underline} Punishment claims are most commonly raised
against the following practices: conditional counterplans, partially
plan inclusive counterplans, permutations against kritiks, extra-topical
plan planks, non-specification of agent by the affirmative, and a range
of affirmative and negative fiat issues. I personally favor some of
these positions, and I oppose others. But I recognize that there are
"pretty good" arguments in favor of both sides with regard to all of
these issues. In other words, they are all, relatively speaking, "close
calls." Or, to put it still another way, there are thoughtful members of
the competitive debate activity for whom each of these practices makes
sense and others for which they do not. [On none of these issues is
there a theoretical consensus.]{.underline} And all have been widely
employed without "destroying debate." This is not to say that these
practices are not fair game for argument. They are[. But none is so
abusive within the context and conventions of debate as we know it that
it needs to be an automatic voting issue.]{.underline} Losing the
argument ought to be punishment enough. Nor do we need punishment to
deal with theories which the consensus of the activity rejects. The
difficulty of winning on counterwarrants or alternative justifications
or plan/plan has easily been enough to discourage these practices.
[Second, the debate over a given theory issue is]{.underline}, by the
end of the round, generally [close.]{.underline} Each team has its list
of brief, blippy reasons to prefer one theory stance or another.
Typically, the two lists are opposed to each other, via a process of
grouping, and without clear, on-point clash. Usually both sides drop one
or more arguments made by their opponents. So again, typically speaking,
judges can almost always find grounds to resolve a given theory debate
either way, and they generally do so based on their own biases. In this
situation, it once again seems to be enough that one side is penalized
by losing the particular theory position. [A slight edge to one team
over the other shouldn't translate into the critical issue in the
round]{.underline}. This is especially true when, as is often the case,
the particular theory issue at stake has occupied a fairly small
percentage of the total time which the debate occupied. My
[fourth]{.underline} major argument against [punishment is]{.underline}
that it is [intolerant. All judges have biases which they are only
partially successful at screening out. And perhaps oddly, judges often
seem less able to set aside their theory biases than their biases on
substantive issues.]{.underline} As I noted above, judges can generally
justify voting either way on a given theory argument in most rounds. At
least if both sides are putting up a decent fight, this is the case. If
a position is conceded, most judges will behave accordingly, though even
here there are exceptions. And sometimes there will be such a clear
preponderance of argument that judges are unable to find their way back
to their own theory predispositions. But with two reasonably skilled
teams, it is generally possible to resolve a given theory issue either
way, so most judges, most of the time, end up endorsing the theory
position which they prefer. This may be an unfortunate fact about
judges, and it certainly applies to some judges more than to others, but
it is a real tendency. It is hardly controversial to say that judges
have biases. But the problem with punishment, in light of this fact, is
that voting on theory empowers those biases. Instead of creating a
strategic slant, the bias becomes all-decisive. What we should
recognize, I think, is that different people can and do legitimately
hold different concepts of what debate should be about. If one side
appeals to our theory preferences and the other side does not, it is not
unreasonable to expect that the side whose views we embrace will win the
debate over a particular issue more often. But [it is intolerant to rule
the other side completely out of order, to decide the whole debate based
on this one issue, just because they have gotten on the wrong side of
one of our theoretical predispositions.]{.underline} A
[fifth]{.underline} problem with punishment [is]{.underline} its
[arbitrariness.]{.underline} Punishment aims at abusive practices. But
[abuse clearly falls on a continuum. And the line at which sufficient
abuse exists to justify a ballot is inevitably arbitrary.]{.underline}
Is a ten second time distortion enough to vote on? A ten-minute time
distortion? Or where in between? This situation is further complicated
by the fact that one never knows just how the team invoking punishment
would have allocated its time absent the problematic practice. Claims
that they had wonderful arguments which time constraints prevented them
from running should be viewed with a good deal of skepticism. Sometimes
arbitrary lines must be drawn. But especially when debate's equivalent
of the death penalty is involved, that arbitrariness should occasion
concern. My [final]{.underline} argument is that punishment snowballs[.
Once the punishment paradigm is embraced, a likely consequence
is]{.underline} what Ross Smith has called ["voting issue
proliferation."]{.underline} Anything can be labeled as a voting issue.
And, indeed, the use of [theory]{.underline} as a voting issue [has
helped]{.underline} to [create a class]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
debate ["cheap shot artists"]{.underline} who systematically employ
punishment strategies. Losing on cheap shots is infuriating for debaters
and coaches, and it is frustrating for many judges to vote on them.
[They certainly don't make debate a more educational activity. And the
teams and debaters who rely on them the most are probably the biggest
losers in educational terms.]{.underline}

#### Competing interpretations is key to deterring future abuse and rectify in round unfairness. 

**Solt '2**

(Roger E. Solt, Debate Coach at the University of Kentucky, "Theory as a
Voting Issue: The Crime of Punishment", 2002 - Mental Health Policies:
Escape from Bedlam?, 2002, http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/

DRGArticles/DRGArtiarticlesIndex.htm)

In Sigel 1, there are four major arguments presented in favor of
punishment. The [first]{.underline} argument was fairness. [Certain
theories and practices were said to be unfair to opposing
debaters.]{.underline} And [it is not enough just to reject these
practices; they may so skew the round that only voting against the team
which employed them can redress competitive equity.]{.underline} The
[second]{.underline} argument was education. Sigel invoked the view that
[the judge should serve as an educator. Part of his or her role as an
educator is to discourage bad arguments. Unfair theories and tactics may
also serve to undercut the educational quality of the debate
experience.]{.underline} The [third]{.underline} argument was
deterrence. [Losing debates,]{.underline} Sigel argued, [is a powerful
inducement for people to change their ways. Debaters]{.underline} are,
for the most part, rational animals, and they [will respond to strong
competitive incentives.]{.underline} Sigel's [fourth]{.underline}
rationale for punishment was argument responsibility. [Punishment with
the ballot makes debaters highly responsible for their
arguments.]{.underline} And [debate]{.underline}, he claimed, [should
teach debaters to argue responsibly.]{.underline}

#### **Reasonability collapses into competing interpretations, if we win our interp creates a better topic than theirs should be considered unreasonable.** 

**Mancuso '82**

(Steve Manusco, Debater for University of Kentucky, Wake Forest
University, 1982, Topicality: In Search of Reason. The Debaters'
Research Guide, groups.wfu.edu/debate)

[In recognition of the many possible definitions of a word, the debate
community has adopted]{.underline} (original mother and father unknown)
[the convention that the affirmative definition only needs to be
\"reasonable.\"]{.underline} This burden traditionally stands opposed to
the notion that the affirmative must have the best definition of a word,
or even necessarily a better definition than the negative. While the
initial theoretical underpinnings for such a convention are far from
clear, it must certainly he justified on the grounds that it promotes
the objective of quality debating. Such a convention recognizes that a
definition is not right or wrong, but merely acceptable or unacceptable
in a given situation. In situations where broad interpretations of a
topic are desirable, a broader-than usual definition may be reasonable,
and where a narrow interpretation is desirable, narrow definitions may
be reasonable. [Such a simplified view of reasonability is not justified
in the face of the recent uses and abuses of such a convention. The
relevant question is: What does it mean to be reasonable?]{.underline}
Again, courts and legislators may have their own definitions of
\"reasonable,\" but they may not be at all useful for the functioning of
the term in debate. To state that a court has been unable to define the
word \"reasonable\" only means that in that particular context it was
difficult, not that such a finding should be accepted as proof that we
cannot come up with a workable concept of reasonability for our
purposes. Of course, someone who has listened to a few debates
concerning \"reasonability\" may find great sympathy with such a court
the concept has taken on very diverse forms, to say the least, in its
varied uses. On one extreme, teams have argued that as long as they were
not \"absurd\" in defining their terms, they were reasonable, and some
teams have argued that because their definition *exists* they are some
how reasonable. On the other end of the definitional continuum, some
interpretations of reasonability have been very restrictive. Some teams
have argued that only the best definition is reasonable\--that it shows
little reason to accept an inferior definition. Clearly there has been
quite a bit of disagreement as to what is entailed by a \"reasonable\"
definition. Some debate critics have responded to this dispute by
throwing up their arms and calling for the abandonment of the concept of
reasonability as a topicality convention altogether. While it is very
easy to respect and have empathy with such sentiment, it seems prudent
to attempt a less radical solution by constructing a more useful and
practical convention of reasonability without \"\"piffing\" the concept
in its entirety. I would suggest two steps in construction of a workable
reasonability convention. First, we must agree upon what makes a
definition acceptable. [Keeping in mind the goal of high quality
debating, two criteria necessary for an acceptable definition should be
(1) Does it tend toward focusing debates on timely and relevant policy
advocacy? and (2) does it allow the negative sufficient ability to be
prepared in both analysis and research? A definition which failed to
meet either of these goals would not seem to he an acceptable approach
to interpretation.]{.underline} Secondly, the actual debate over
topicality should center on the question of whether or not the
affirmative interpretation actually did meet both of these criteria. In
this sense, [the \"threshold\" for when a definition became
\"reasonable\" would be raised well above the currently less rigorous
approaches, yet not overly restrict the affirmative initial and
presumptive right to define its terms. The burden would be on the
affirmative to explain, wren challenged, the implications of its
definition, thus reviving the concept of an affirmative burden on
topicality, without making the burden prohibitively heavy by making them
refute any conceivable negative alternative definition. In an effort to
supplement the convention of \"reasonability,\" \"standards\" of
definition have been offered which the affirmative should meet in order
to be considered reasonable. These standards could potentially be used
to discern whether or not the affirmative approach met the above two
criteria.]{.underline}

### Depth/Breadth/Limits 

#### Depth outweighs breadth. 

**Tai et al '8**

Tai et al 08 \[(Robert) Curriculum, Instruction, and Special Education
Department, Curry School of Education) "Depth Versus Breadth: How
Content Coverage in High School Science Courses Relates to Later Success
in College Science Course work" 2008\]

[The]{.underline} baseline [model reveals]{.underline} a direct and
compelling outcome: [teaching for depth is associated with improvements
in later performance.]{.underline} Of course, there is much to consider
in evaluating the implications of such an analysis. There are a number
of questions about this simple conclusion that naturally emerge. For
example, ho w much depth works best? What is the optimal manner to
operationalize the impact of depth-based learning? Do specific contexts
(such as type of student, teacher, or school) moderate the impact of
depth? The answers to these questions certainly suggest that a more
nuanced view should be sought. Nonetheless, this analysis appears to
indicate that a robust positive association exists between high school
science teaching that pro v ides depth in at least one topic and better
performances in introductory postsecondary science courses. [Our
results]{.underline} also [clearly suggest that breadth-based
learning]{.underline}, as commonly applied in high school classrooms,
[does not appear to offer students any advantage when they enroll in
introductory college]{.underline} science [courses]{.underline},
although it may contribute to higher scores on standardized tests.
However, the intuitive appeal of broadly surveying a discipline in an
introductory high school course cannot be overlooked. There might be
benefits to such a pedagogy that become apparent when using measures
that we did not explore. The results regarding breadth were less
compelling because in only one of the three disciplines were the results
significant in our full model. On the other hand, we observed no
positive effects at all. As it stands, [our findings]{.underline} at
least [suggest that aiming for breadth in content coverage should be
avoided]{.underline}, as we found no evidence to support such an
approach.

#### Limits are k2 clash and in depth discussion.

**Hardy 10**

(Aaron T. Hardy, Coach at Whitman College, "CONDITIONALITY, CHEATING
COUNTERPLANS, AND CRITIQUES: TOPIC CONSTRUCTION AND THE RISE OF THE
"NEGATIVE CASE"", Contemporary Argumentation & Debate, 2010, pg. 44-45,
[http://www.cedadebate.org/cad/index.php/CAD/article/view
File/271/243](http://www.cedadebate.org/cad/index.php/CAD/article/view%20File/271/243))

First, [narrow topics]{.underline} are more likely to [encourage
substantive clash. One of the primary motivations for negative teams
running away from engagement with the specifics of the affirmative is
fear of "falling behind" in the necessary research effort. On a topic
with 200 topical affirmative plan mechanisms, it is extremely unlikely
that all but the most precocious of negative teams will be prepared to
debate each one, and much more likely that they will turn instead to as
generic of an approach as possible.]{.underline} Despite sentiments from
some corners that the topic writing process is already too narrow and
specialized, I would submit that the debate community has not yet truly
experimented with what a radically narrower topic might entail. Even the
smallest topics in recent memory have afforded the affirmative an
incredible amount of flexibility, usually as a compromise to the "broad
topics good" camp. A quick perusal of any of the archived case lists
from the past decade reveals that even the narrowest topics the
community has debated have entailed dozens (if not hundreds) of discrete
affirmatives. Instead, [envision as a potentially hyperbolic example, a
topic with truly only to prepare a truly in-depth take on each one.
Chosen in concert with the right literature base, perhaps the word
"stale" could be replaced with "nuanced," even if debates superficially
resemble each other as the year progresses.]{.underline}

#### Limits means your case needs to be predictable

**Kupferberg '87**

Eric Kupferbreg, University of Kentucky 1987 "Limits - The Essence of
Topicality"

<http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Kupferberg1987LatAmer.htm>

If one considers [the purpose of topicality\--to initiate a meaningful
discussion with sufficient prior notice and adequate ground for both
sides]{.underline}\--then the questions of delimitation become the focus
of topicality standards. Both \'reasonability\' and \'best definition\'
claim to enhance the debate process\--the former by providing adequate
ground for affirmative case areas and the latter by preventing an
unreasonable run-a-way topic.¶ [I am not suggesting that limits should
be the only test for topicality]{.underline}. If this were sole
criteria, teams could argue that inherently limited topics are superior,
hence, negatives win because their definition excludes the affirmative
(there\'s always a competitive incentive to limit the affirmative out of
the round). Obviously, limits for limits sake is arbitrary as well as
abusive[.]{.underline} [However, debatable limits are clearly desirable.
What are]{.underline} these [\'debatable limits\'?]{.underline} Here are
some relevant questions that if answered carefully might help to create
criteria for debatable limits:¶ 1) Are there fair number of cases that
would be topical? An interpretation that overlimited the resolution
would be as inappropriate as one which unlimited the topic. [An entire
year of debating a single case or 300 cases would be neither educational
or enjoyable. An interpretation that allowed somewhere between 20 and 40
cases might be acceptable to most participants in the
activity.¶]{.underline} 2) Is the interpretation open to innovation?
Part of the intrigue of debating the same topic year round is the
competitive incentive for affirmatives to seek new slants. [A debatable
interpretation should allow for new cases\--although they would be
chosen from a predictable range of areas]{.underline}. A debatable limit
should not force an overly static topic.¶ 3) Does the interpretation fit
within some scope of the field context? While not suggesting that we
should rely on field contextual definitions alone, [an interpretation of
the topic should bear some resemblance to the topic area.]{.underline}
It would be almost axiomatic to suggest that a definition of
\'agricultural\' last year should lend itself to cases that are relevant
to real world agricultural issues.¶ 4) Does the interpretation allow for
some degree of prior notice? [A debatable limit is one where a large
number of topical cases are to be anticipated by the general debate
community.]{.underline} This is not to imply that surprise \'squirrels\'
should be prohibited, only that definitions should encompass what a
large portion of the debate circuit is running.

#### Limits destroy creative thinking -- innovation results from breaking rules and challenging dominate modes of thought. 

**Clark 07**

\[(Brian, CEO and founder of Coppyblogger Media) "Do You Recognize These
10 Mental Blocks to Creative Thinking?", Coppyblogger, 9/18/07\]

Whether you're trying to solve a tough problem, start a business, get
attention for that business or write an interesting article, [creative
thinking]{.underline} is crucial. The process [boils down to changing
your perspective and seeing things differently than you currently do.
People like to call this "thinking outside of the box,"]{.underline}
which is the wrong way to look at it. Just like Neo needed to understand
that "[there is no spoon](http://www.donnarose.com/Spoon.html)" in the
film *The Matrix*, you need to realize ["there is no box" to step
outside of.]{.underline} You create your own imaginary boxes simply by
living life and accepting certain things as "real" when they are just as
illusory as the beliefs of a paranoid delusional. The difference is,
enough people agree that certain man-made concepts are "real," so you're
viewed as "normal." This is good for society overall, but it's that sort
of unquestioning consensus that inhibits your natural creative
abilities. So, rather than looking for ways to *inspire* creativity, you
should just realize the truth. You're already capable of creative
thinking at all times, but you have to strip away the imaginary mental
blocks (or boxes) that you've picked up along the way to wherever you
are today. I like to keep this list of 10 common ways we suppress our
natural creative abilities nearby when I get stuck. It helps me realize
that the barriers to a good idea are truly all in my head. 1. Trying to
Find the "Right" Answer [One of the worst aspects of formal education is
the focus on the correct answer to a particular question or
problem.]{.underline} While [this approach]{.underline} helps us
function in society, it [hurts creative thinking because real-life
issues are ambiguous. There's often more than one "correct" answer, and
the second one you come up with might be better than the
first.]{.underline} Many of the following mental blocks can be turned
around to reveal ways to find more than one answer to any given problem.
[Try reframing the issue in several different ways in order to prompt
different answers, and embrace answering inherently ambiguous questions
in several different ways.]{.underline} 2. Logical Thinking Not only is
real life ambiguous, it's often illogical to the point of madness. While
[critical thinking skills based on logic are]{.underline} one of our
main strengths in evaluating the feasibility of a creative idea, it's
[often the enemy of truly innovative thoughts in the first place. **One
of the best ways to escape the constraints of your own logical mind is
to think
[metaphorically](http://www.copyblogger.com/become-a-master-of-metaphor-and-multiply-your-blogging-effectiveness/).**]{.underline}
One of the reasons why metaphors work so well in communications is that
we accept them as true without thinking about it. [When you realize that
"truth" is often symbolic, you'll often find that you are actually free
to come up with alternatives.]{.underline} 3. Following Rules One way to
[view creative thinking is]{.underline} to look at it as [a destructive
force. You're tearing away the often arbitrary rules that others have
set for you]{.underline}, and asking either "why" or "why not" whenever
confronted with the way "everyone" does things. This is easier said than
done, since [people will often defend the rules they follow even in the
face of evidence that the rule doesn't work.]{.underline} People love to
celebrate rebels like Richard Branson, but few seem brave enough to
emulate him. Quit worshipping rule breakers and **[start breaking some
rules.]{.underline}** 4. Being Practical Like logic, [practicality is
hugely important when it comes to execution, but often stifles
innovative ideas before they can properly blossom.]{.underline} Don't
allow [the editor](http://www.copyblogger.com/copywriting-curse/) into
the same room with your inner artist. [Try not to evaluate the actual
feasibility of an approach until you've allowed it to exist on its own
for a bit.]{.underline} Spend time asking "what if" as often as
possible, and simply allow your imagination to go where it wants. You
might just find yourself discovering a crazy idea that's so insanely
practical that no one's thought of it before. 5. Play is Not Work
Allowing your mind to be at play is perhaps the most effective way to
stimulate creative thinking, and yet many people disassociate play from
work. These days, the people who can come up with great ideas and
solutions are the most economically rewarded, while worker bees are
often employed for the benefit of the creative thinkers. You've heard
the expression "work hard and play hard." All you have to realize is
that they're the same thing to a creative thinker. 6. That's Not My Job
[In an era of hyper-specialization, it's those who happily explore
completely unrelated areas of life and knowledge who best see that
everything is related.]{.underline} This goes back to what ad man [Carl
Ally](http://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-write-remarkably-creative-content/)
said about creative persons---they want to be *know-it-alls*. Sure,
you've got to know the specialized stuff in your field, but if you [view
yourself as an explorer rather than a highly-specialized cog in the
machine]{.underline}, you'll run circles around the technical master in
the success department. 7. Being a "Serious" Person Most of what keeps
us civilized boils down to conformity, consistency, shared values, and
yes, thinking about things the same way everyone else does. There's
nothing wrong with that necessarily, but if you can mentally accept that
it's actually nothing more than groupthink that helps a society
function, you can then give yourself permission to turn everything
that's accepted upside down and shake out the illusions. Leaders from
Egyptian pharaohs to Chinese emperors and European royalty have
consulted with *fools*, or court jesters, when faced with tough
problems. The persona of the fool allowed the truth to be told, without
the usual ramifications that might come with speaking blasphemy or
challenging ingrained social conventions. Give yourself permission to be
a fool and see things for what they really are. 8. Avoiding Ambiguity We
rationally realize that most every situation is ambiguous to some
degree. And although dividing complex situations into black and white
boxes can lead to disaster, we still do it. [It's an innate
characteristic of human psychology to desire certainty, but it's the
creative thinker who rejects the false comfort of clarity when it's not
really appropriate.]{.underline} [Ambiguity is your friend if you're
looking to innovate.]{.underline} The fact that most people are
uncomfortable exploring uncertainty gives you an advantage, as long as
you can embrace ambiguity rather than run from it.
