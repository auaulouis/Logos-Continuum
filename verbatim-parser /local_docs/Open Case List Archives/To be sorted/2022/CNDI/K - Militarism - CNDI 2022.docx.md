#### The 1AC is part of a desire to displace the insecurities of everyday life onto an external narrative- this entrenches militarism as ideology and presents it as a necessity

Security Dialogue¶ ﻿1--¶ 12

As Salter (2006: 180) explains, though[, it is not simply that states
manage subjects but that the¶ price of 'freedom']{.underline}, of an
everyday life removed from insecurity, [is that 'we come to manage
ourselves¶ through a confessionary complex']{.underline}. Key to this is
that [we 'recognize ourselves as a society]{.underline}, as¶ part of a
social entity, as a part of a nation or of a state' (Michel Foucault,
cited in Salter, 2006: 181)¶ [and regard others as outside this. The
desire for this way of life means]{.underline}, therefore, **[that it is
not just¶ existential insecurity that facilitates war and war
preparedness, but the multitude of insecurities that¶ make up everyday
life]{.underline}**, [from needing to have steady employment to wanting
to feel part of a]{.underline} social¶ and political
[community]{.underline}. Thus, [while global fears are materialized and
affective in everyday sites,¶ other and often more pressing matters also
play a role in the reproduction of liberal militarism]{.underline}
(Pain¶ and Smith, 2008). As Dowler (2012: 497) points out, **[this is
why it is vital to consider how 'militarization¶ takes root in the banal
processes of daily life that are essential to the reproduction of¶
sovereignty']{.underline}**.¶ As Eastwood (this issue) argues, though,
**[everyday desire for war also animates militarism]{.underline}**;
fear¶ only gets us so far. Importantly, however, as Eastwood also
contends, **[desire is not necessarily¶ fervent: it can be more
ambiguous, even unconscious]{.underline}**. Anthropologist Gerald Sider
(2008: 124--¶ 125) sheds further light on this when describing the
everyday as an achievement; as those ways in¶ which people work through
and against the chaos, rupture and discontinuity that shape their lives¶
to 'try to make and to claim some kind of ordinary -- some stability to
today, some continuity¶ between yesterday and tomorrow, in some parts of
their lives at least'. Sider (2008: 125) moreover¶ maintains that ['what
we call everyday life does not name a feature or an aspect of social
existence¶ ... but a very high-stakes struggle']{.underline} [-- a
struggle that is for many people throughout the world¶ 'largely
unavoidable and often in the medium to long run
unwinnable']{.underline}. [The desire for the ordinary¶ should not be
underestimated, therefore; it takes on a profound, if often
taken-for-granted, importance]{.underline}¶ not least 'because it
belongs to the people who have it -- it is their time, their space,
what¶ makes their moments and their interactions their space and place'
(Sider, 2008: 129--130, emphasis¶ in original).¶ [It is not difficult to
imagine why this possession of 'normality' would be desirable to
liberal¶ populations promised that freedom is the very condition of
their existence]{.underline}. [Perceived threats to that¶ freedom might
motivate fears and suspicions that foster militarism]{.underline}.
Equally, though, in the example¶ of Syrian airstrikes, and hostility and
ambivalence to resettling Syrian refugees, the desire of¶ British
citizens to have everyday lives free from concern about the everyday
lives of others may¶ call into question the ability of Syrians to have
not only an everyday but any life at all. While such¶ effects of desire
to protect one's own everyday are not always deliberate or callous, [the
prioritization¶ of some lives and ways of life over others facilitates
biopolitical forms of state power that¶ entail that 'the liberal way of
war is governed, in part, by the very exercise of such discrimination¶
and the application of lethal violence to it']{.underline} (Dillon and
Reid, 2009: 49).

#### Militarist ideology results in the permanent racialized targeting and elimination of bodies to maintain a global economy of violence, a process to which the peoples of the Global North will only respond with a disembodied indifference

[.]{.underline}¶ Ondaatje\'s novel (2000) opens with an Author\'s Note
that locates the narrative at a time when \"the antigovernment
insurgents in the south and the separatist guerrillas in the north???had
declared war on the government\" and \"legal and illegal government
squads were???sent out to hunt down\" both groups. In this instance, the
Hobbesian rhetoric of a \"war of all against all\" is more than a
clich??. In fact, it is symptomatic of the novel\'s ambiguous critique
of the role of the Sri Lankan nation-state and its elaborate, modernist
discourse of violence. The Note foreshadows what the narrator later
repeats on several occasions, namely that Sri Lanka\'s war is a war
fought \"for the purpose of war\" (ibid., 98) and for which \"\[t\]here
is no hope of affixing blame\" (ibid., 17). In short, the \"reason for
war was war\" (ibid., 43). At first glance, the narrative\'s emphasis on
the war\'s self-perpetuating dynamics implies a Hobbesian understanding
of violence as the natural state of human existence. At the same time,
it translates the actual politics of Sri Lanka\'s war into the Deleuzean
idiom of the \"war machine.\" For, according to Deleuze and Guattari,
armed conflict functions outside the control and accountability of the
\"state apparatus???prior to its laws\" (1987, 352), and beyond its
initial causes. Although such an interpretation of Sri Lanka\'s war
reflects what the political scientist Jayadeva Uyangoda calls the
\"intractability of the Sri Lankan crisis\" (1999, 158), its political
and ethical stakes outweigh its gains. 6¶ To begin with, the novel\'s
leitmotif of \"perpetual war\" situates Sri Lanka\'s conflict within a
general context of global war, because, as the narrator reports, it is
fought with \"modern weaponry,\" supported by \"backers on the sidelines
in safe countries,\" and \"sponsored by gun-and drug-runners\" (Ondaajte
2000, 43). In this scenario, the rule of law has deteriorated into \"a
belief in???revenge\" (ibid., 56), and the state is either absent or
part of the country\'s all-consuming anarchy of violence. This absence
suggests that the state no longer functions, in Max Weber\'s famous
words, as \"a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of
the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory\" (2002,
13). It is of course possible to argue that the novel\'s critique of the
Sri Lankan nation-state lies in its absence. It seems to me, however,
that [the narrative\'s tendency to locate]{.underline} the dynamics of
Sri Lanka\'s [war outside the state and within a post-national vision of
a new global order **generates a normative narrative of global
war**]{.underline}. [On the one hand, it resonates with the]{.underline}
popular ??? though [misleading]{.underline} ??? [notion]{.underline}
that the \"appearance [of \'failed states\']{.underline},\" as Samuel
Huntington argues in his controversial study The Clash of Civilizations,
intensifies \"tribal, ethnic, and religious conflict\" [and thus
\"contributes to \[the\] image of a world in anarchy]{.underline}\"
(1996, 35). [On the other, situating Sri Lanka\'s war outside the
institutions of the state re-inscribes a Hobbesian notion of violence
that helps **legitimize and cultivate structural violence** as a
permissive way of conducting politics]{.underline}. Such a reading of
violence, however, overlooks that in a global context violence has
become \"profoundly anti-Hobbesian\" (Balibar 2001, xi). Balibar
usefully suggests that [the twentieth century history of extreme
violence has made it impossible to regard violence as \"a structural
condition that precedes institutions.\"]{.underline} Instead, he
maintains, \"we have had to accept???that extreme
**[violence]{.underline}** [is not post-historical but actually
post-institutional.\" It \"**arises from institutions**]{.underline} as
much as it arises against them\" (ibid., xi). Thus, in such popular
post-colonial narratives of war as Anil\'s Ghost, [the normalization of
violence figures as a forgetting of the institutional entrenchment and
historical use of violence as a state-sanctioned political
practice]{.underline}.¶ If Ondaatje\'s novel presents Sri Lanka\'s war
as an \"inherently violent\" event (Das 1998), it is also an event
narrated through the symbolism and logic of archaic primitivism. For
example, in the novel\'s central passage on the nature of human
violence, the narrator observes, \"The most precisely recorded moments
of history lay adjacent to the extreme actions of nature or civilisation
???Tectonic slips and brutal human violence provided random
time-capsules of unhistorical lives???A dog in Pompeii. A gardener in
Hiroshima\" (Ondaatje 2002, 55). [The symbolic leveling of]{.underline}
the arbitrariness of primordial chaos and [the apparently **ahistorical
anarchism of violence** create a rhetoric]{.underline} of the archaic
that is characteristic, as Nancy argues, of \"anything that is properly
to be called war\" (2000, 128). He convincingly argues that archaic
symbolism \"indicates [that \[war\] escapes from being part of
\'history\' understood as]{.underline} the progress of a linear/or
**[cumulative time\"]{.underline}** **[and can be rearticulated as no
more than a \"regrettable\" remnant of an earlier age]{.underline}**
(ibid., 128). In that, Nancy\'s observation coincides with Hardt and
Negri\'s that [the \"war on terror\" employs a medievalist rhetoric of
just and unjust wars that **moralizes** rather than legitimizes the use
of global violence by putting it outside the realm of reason and
critique]{.underline}. In Nancy\'s observation, however, two things are
at stake. First, what initially appears to be a postmodern critique of
the grand narratives of history in fact demonstrates that a non-linear
account of history may lend itself to the transformation of extreme
violence into exceptional events. In this way **[violence is normalized
as a transhistorical category that fails to address the unequal
political and economic relations of power, which lie at the heart of
global wars.]{.underline}**¶ Second, Nancy rightly warns us against
treating war as an archaic relic that is \"tendentiously effaced in the
progress and project of a global humanity\" (2000, 128). For not only
does war return in the process of negotiating sovereignty on a global
and local plane, but the representation of war in terms of archaic
images also repeats a primordialist explanation of what are structurally
new wars. As theorists such as Appadurai and Kaldor have argued, the
primordialist hypothesis of global wars merely reinforces those mass
mediated images of global violence that dramatize ethnic wars as
pre-modern, tribalist forms of strife. Huntington\'s notion of
civilization or \"fault-line\" wars as communal conflicts born out of
the break-up of earlier political formations, demographic changes, and
the collision of mutually exclusive religions and civilizations presents
the most prominent and politically influential version of a
primordialist and bipolar conceptualization of global war. In contrast
to Huntington\'s approach, however, the narrative of Anil\'s Ghost
contends that all forms of violence \"have come into their comparison\"
(Ondaatje 2000, 203). Notwithstanding its universalizing impetus, [the
novel]{.underline} thus [insists on the impossibility to think the
nation and a new global order outside the technologies of violence and
modernity]{.underline}. Indeed, in the novel\'s narrative [it is the
suffering of all war victims that \"has come into their comparison\"
and]{.underline} suggests that the **[new wars breed a culture of
violence that shapes everyone\'s life yet for which no one appears to be
accountable.]{.underline}** On the one hand, then, the novel\'s
self-critical humanitarian project seeks to initiate a communal and
individual process of mourning by naming, and therefore accounting for,
in Anil\'s words, \"the unhistorical dead\" (ibid, 56). On the other
hand, read as its critical investment in the war\'s politics of
complicity, the novel\'s humanitarian endeavor is countered by the
narrator\'s tendency to articulate violence in archaic and anarchistic
terms. For, to revert to the symbolic language of \"primitivism and
anarchy\" and \"to treat \[the new wars\] as natural disasters,\" as
Kaldor observes (2001, 113), designates a common way of dealing with
them. Thus **[the rhetoric of the archaic not merely dehistoricizes
violence but contributes to the]{.underline}** making of a
**[normative]{.underline}** and popular **[imaginary through which to
make global wars thinkable]{.underline}** and comprehensible. Thus,
[their violent excesses appear to be rooted in primordialist
constructions]{.underline} [of the failed]{.underline} post-colonial
nation-[state]{.underline} **[rather than a phenomenon with deep-seated
roots in the global histories of the present]{.underline}**. **[Such a
normative imaginary of global war is produced for the Global North so as
to dehistoricize its own position in the various colonial processes of
nation formation and global economic restructuring of the Global
South.]{.underline}** In this way, as Ondaatje\'s novel equally
demonstrates, [the]{.underline} Global [North can detach
itself]{.underline} from the Global South [and create the]{.underline}
kind of **[historical]{.underline}** and cultural
**[distance]{.underline}** **[needed to accept ultra-objective violence
as a normative state of existence.¶]{.underline}** Conceptualizing war
as a phenomenon of criminal and anarchistic violence, however, may do
more than merely conform to the popular imagination about the chaotic
and untamable nature of contemporary warfare. Indeed, [anarchistic
notions of violence tend to **compress**]{.underline} the grand
narratives and petite recits of **[history into a total,
singular]{.underline}** present of perpetual uncertainty, fear, and
political confusion and generate what the post-colonial anthropologist
David Scott sees as Sri Lanka\'s [\"**dehistoricized\"
history**.]{.underline} Given the important role the claiming of ancient
Sinhalese and Hindu history played in the violent identity politics that
drive Sri Lanka\'s war, Scott suggests that devaluing or dehistoricizing
history as a founding category of Sri Lanka\'s narrative of the nation
breaks the presumably \"natural???link between past identities and the
legitimacy of present political claims\" (1999, 103). This strategy
seems useful because it uncouples Sri Lanka\'s colonially shaped and
glorified Sinhalese past from its present claims to political power. We
need to note, however, that, according to Scott, dehistoricizing the
past does not suggest writing from a historical vacuum. Rather, [it
refers to a process of]{.underline} denaturalizing and, thus,
[de-legitimizing]{.underline} the normative [narratives of ethnicized
and racialized narratives of national identity.]{.underline}¶ Anil\'s
Ghost engages in this process of \"[dehistoricizing]{.underline}\" by
foregrounding the fictitious and fragmented, the elusive and ephemeral
character of [history]{.underline}. Indeed, as the historian Antoinette
Burton suggests, the novel [offers \"a reflection on **the continued
possibility of History itself as an exclusively western epistemological
form**]{.underline}\" (2003, 40). The latter clearly finds expression in
what Sarath\'s brother, Gamini, condemns as \"the last two hundred years
of Western political writing\" (Ondaatje 2000, 285). Steeped in the
imperial project of the West, such writing is facilitated by and serves
to erase the figure of the non-European cultural Other in order to
produce and maintain what Jacques Derrida famously called the \"[white
mythology]{.underline}\" (1982, 207) of Western metaphysics. The novel
usefully [extends]{.underline} its reading of [violence
into]{.underline} a related critique of [knowledge
production]{.underline}, **[so that the latter becomes]{.underline}**
legible as being **[complicit in the production of perpetual violence
and war]{.underline}**. This critique is perhaps most articulated
through the character of Palipana, Sarath\'s teacher and Sri Lanka\'s
formerly renowned but now fallen anthropologist. Once an agent of Sri
Lanka\'s anti-colonial liberation movement, Palipana represents the
generation of cultural nationalist who sought history and national
identity in an essentially Sinhalese culture and natural environment.
Rather than employing empirical and colonial methods of knowledge
production and historiography, Palipana had left the path of scientific
objectivity, tinkered with translations of historical texts, and
\"approached runes???with the pragmatic awareness of locally inherited
skills\" (Ondaatje 2000, 82) until \"the unprovable truth emerged\"
(ibid., 83). Now, years after his fall from scientific grace, Palipana
lives the life of an ascetic, following the \"strict principles of\" a
\"sixth-century sect of monks\" (ibid., 84). To him, history and nature
have become one, for \"all history was filled with sunlight, every
hollow was filled with rain\" (ibid., 84). Yet, Ondaatje\'s construction
of Palipana and his account of the eye-painting ritual of a Buddha
statue ??? a ritual that assumes a central place in the novel\'s
cosmopolitan vision of artisanship as a practice of cultural and
religious syncretism in the service of post-conflict community building
??? are themselves built on a number of historical texts listed in the
novel\'s \"Acknowledgment\" section. As Antoinette Burton astutely
observes, \"the orientalism of some of the texts on Ondaatje\'s list is
astonishing, a phenomenon which suggests the ongoing suppleness of
\'history\' as an instrument of political critique and ideological
intervention\" (2003, 50). Rather than effectively \"dehistorizing\" the
character of Palipana, then, Ondaatje bases this character and the
eye-painting ceremony on a central Sri Lankan modernist text, Ananada K.
Coomaraswamy\'s Mediaeval Sinhalese Art (1908/1956).¶ Cont ¶ For Hardt
and Negri, then, the state of exception functions as the universal
condition and legitimization of global civil war, while **[positioning
the United States as a global power]{.underline}**, which **[transforms
war \"into the primary organizing principle of society\"]{.underline}**
(2004, 12). They rightly observe that **[the state of exception blurs
the boundaries between peace and war, violence and
mediation]{.underline}**. Yet, curiously enough, Hardt and Negri\'s
understanding of the state of exception largely emphasizes the
concept\'s regulatory and pragmatic politics, so that the United States
emerges as a sovereign power on grounds of its ability to decide on the
state of exception. By exempting itself from international law and
courts of law, protecting its military from being subjected to
international control, allowing preemptive strikes, and engaging in
torture and illegal detention (ibid., 8), the United States
instrumentalizes and maintains war as a state of exception in the name
of global security and thus seeks to consolidate its hegemonic role
within Empire. Although Hardt and Negri openly disagree with Agamben\'s
reading of the state of exception as defining \"power itself as a
\'monopoly of violence\' \" (2004, 364), it seems to me that Agamben\'s
theory of the state of exception, as put forward in Homo Sacer rather
than in States of Exception, might be usefully read alongside Hardt and
Negri\'s crucial claim that global civil war as well as resistance
movements depend on the \"production of subjectivity\" through
immaterial labour (2000, 66). What this argument overlooks is that,
according to Agamben, the state of exception constitutes an abject space
or \"a zone of indistinction between outside and inside, exclusion and
inclusion\" (1998, 181), where subjectivity enters a political and legal
order solely on grounds of its exclusion. Moreover, the sovereign ???
albeit a nation, sovereign power, or global network of power ??? can
only transform the rule of law into the force of law by suspending the
legal system from a position that is simultaneously inside and outside
the law. Through these mechanisms of exclusion and contradiction,
subjectivity is not so much created as it is deprived of its social and
political relationships. Thus [the \"originary activity\" of global
civil war is the violent conflation of political and social relationship
and thereby the \"production of bare life\"]{.underline} (ibid., 83),
[of life that need not be accounted for]{.underline}, [as is the case
with the civilian casualties of]{.underline} the US-led [war against
Iraq.]{.underline} The state of exception, however, also figures as a
prominent concept in post-colonial theory, for it raises questions not
only about the ways in which we configure the human but also how we
understand imperial or global war. ¶ In 1940, [Benjamin famously wrote,
\"the tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the \'state of
emergency\']{.underline} in which we live [is not the exception but the
rule. **We must attain to a conception of history that is in keeping
with this insight**]{.underline}\" (1968, 257). Benjamin\'s statement,
as Homi Bhabha reminds us half a century later in his essay
\"Interrogating Identity,\" can be usefully advanced for a critical
analysis of the dialectical ??? if not revolutionary ??? relationship
between oppression, violence, and anti-colonial historiography. Indeed,
\"the state of emergency,\" as Bhabha says, \"is also always a state of
emergence\" (1994, 41). Read in the context of today\'s global state of
exception, namely the recurrence and intensification of ethnic civil
wars across the globe and the coincidence of democratic and totalitarian
forms of political rule, Bhabha\'s statement entails a number of risks
and suggestions for a post-colonial historiography of global civil war.¶
First, Bhabha\'s notion of emergency/emergence reflects his critical
reading of Fanon\'s vision of national identity and thus reconsiders the
state of emergency as a possible site of \"the occult instability where
the people dwell\" (Fanon 1963, 227) and give birth to popular movements
of national liberation. In this context, the state of exception might be
understood as both constitutive to the alienation that is intrinsic to
liberation movements and instrumental for a radical euphoria and
excessive hope that create and spectralize the post-colonial
nation-state as a deferred promise of decolonization. It is through this
perspective that we can critically evaluate Hardt and Negri\'s
endorsement of what they call \"democratic violence\" (2004, 344). This
kind of violence, they argue, belongs to the multitude. It is neither
creative nor revolutionary but used on political rather than moral
grounds. When organized horizontally, according to democratic principles
of decision making, democratic violence serves as a means of defending
\"the accomplishments\" of \"political and social transformation\"
(ibid., 344). Notwithstanding the concept\'s romantic and utopian
inflections, democratic violence also derives from Hardt and Negri\'s
earlier argument that \"the great wars of liberation are (or should be)
oriented ultimately toward a \'war against war,\' that is, an active
effort to destroy the regime of violence that perpetuates our state of
war and supports the systems of inequality and oppression.\" This, they
conclude, is \"a condition necessary for realizing the democracy of the
multitude\" (ibid., 67). In one quick stroke, Hardt and Negri move
anti-colonial liberation wars into their post-national paradigm of
Empire and divest them of their cultural and historical particularities.
Moreover, translating explicitly national liberation movements into a
universalizing narrative of global pacifism precludes a critique of
violence within its particular historical and philosophical formation.
In contrast[, a post-colonial analysis of global war must tease out the
intersections between the ways in which **racialized violence
constitutes**]{.underline} colonial and post-colonial processes of
**[nation formation and helps construct an absolute enemy through which
to legitimize global war and to abdicate responsibility for the
dehumanizing effects of global economic restructuring.]{.underline}**¶
Second, while Bhabha\'s pun is symptomatic of the resisting properties
that he sees as operative in the various practices of colonial
ambiguity, it also, despite Benjamin\'s opinion, draws attention to the
possibility that [oppression alters the linear flow of Western history
and challenges \"the transparency of social reality, as a pre-given
image of human knowledge]{.underline}\" (Bhabha 1994, 41). Here, Bhabha
rightfully asks to what extent do states of emergency or acts of extreme
violence constitute a historical rupture and, more importantly, call
into question the nature of the human subject. It is at this point that
a post-colonial reading of the state of exception fruitfully coincides
with Agamben\'s notion of exception. For in both cases, the focus of
inquiry is the construction of disposable life through the logic of
necropower and the collapse of social and political relationships that
enable the exercise of particularly racialized forms of violence,
including torture and disappearances.¶ Third, Bhabha\'s notion of the
double movement of emergency and emergence envisions an anti-colonialist
historiography in terms of a dialectical process of perpetual
transformation. It is at this point, however, that the coupling of
emergency or exception and emergence becomes problematic for at least
two reasons. First, combining both terms prematurely translates [the
violence of the political event]{.underline} into that of metaphor and
[risks **erasing the micro- or quotidian narratives of
violence**]{.underline} ??? such as Arasanayagam\'s account of war ???
that both legitimate and are perpetuated by political and social states
of emergency. In order to examine the relationship between global and
communal forms of violence, a critical practice of post-colonial
studies, I suggest, must reassess the term \"transformation\" and,
concurrently, the assumption that acts of extreme global violence can be
advanced in the service of \"making history\" (Balibar 2001, 26). In
other words, if, as Hannah Arendt argues, there has been a historical
\"reluctance to deal with violence as a separate phenomenon in its own
right\" (2002, 25), it is time to examine the possibility of employing
post-colonial studies in the service of a non-dialectical critique of
global war. This kind of [critique must ask to what extent those on
whose bodies extreme violence was exercised are **a priori excluded from
articulating any transformative theory of violence**]{.underline}.
[How]{.underline}, in other words, [does bare life]{.underline} ??? if
at all possible ??? [attain the status of subjectivity within the
dehumanizing logic of exception or global civil war?¶]{.underline}
Fourth, like Bhabha, [we need to take seriously]{.underline} Benjamin\'s
insight into **[the intrinsic relationship between violence and the
conceptualization of history.]{.underline}** Notwithstanding Bhabha\'s
pivotal argument that the violence of [a \"unitary notion of
history]{.underline}\" generates a \"unitary,\" and therefore extremely
violent, \"concept of man\" (1994, 42), I wish to caution, alongside
Benjamin\'s analysis of fascism, that what enables today\'s global civil
war is that even \"its opponents treat it as a historical norm\"
(Benjamin 1968, 257). What is at stake, then, in dominant as well as
critical narratives of global civil war is their representation as
natural rather than political phenomena, and the acceptance of
globalization as a political fait accompli. Both of these aspects, I
believe, **[contribute to the proliferation of dehistoricized concepts
of the global increase of racialized violence and war]{.underline}**. It
seems to me, however, that **[the enormous rise of
violence]{.underline}** [inflicted by global civil wars]{.underline}
**[requires]{.underline}** a post-colonial historiography and
**[critique]{.underline}** of global war **[that questions notions of
history based on]{.underline}** cultural
**[fragmentation]{.underline}**, rupture, and totalization.
**[Instead]{.underline}**, such a **[historiography must seek out
patterns of connection and connectivity]{.underline}**. But more
importantly, as I have argued in this paper, **[it must]{.underline}**
trace the post-colonial moment of global civil war and begin to **[read
contemporary war through the interconnected necropolitics of global and
imperial warfare.]{.underline}** Thus, [to understand the logic and
practice of global war we need to **develop a greater
understanding**]{.underline} precisely **[of]{.underline}** those civil
wars and national liberation wars that do not appear to threaten the new
global order. Furthermore, a post-colonial critique of global civil war
should facilitate the decoding and rescripting of both **[the
normalizing narratives and racialized embodiment of global civil
warfare.]{.underline}**¶

#### **The alternative is critical peace research, a strategy that continuously critiques and questions sovereign conceptions of violence and peace while simultaneously committing to the ethical and practical imperative of non-violent resistance to structures of domination.**

[Critical peace research]{.underline}: a proposal On the basis of the
above assessment, this section briefly outlines a set of core
commitments which I believe ought to characterise CPR. I conceive of
'critical' (peace) research in two primary senses. First, it simply
means an intellectual orientation or attitude which attempts to stand
apart from the existing order (while at the same time acknowledging that
one can never fully escape one's own situatedness or biases), which
[questions widely accepted common- sense and dominant forms of knowledge
about peace and conflict, and]{.underline} which [asks probing questions
about **how existing social and epistemic orders came into existence**
and the processes by which they are maintained]{.underline}. Second, and
more narrowly, the term 'critical' is used to refer to approaches which
draw upon the analytical tools and insights of Frankfurt School-
inspired Critical Theory, as well as related critical-normative social
theories and disciplinary approaches such as critical constructivism,
post- structuralism, feminism, post- colonialism and others. In the
first instance, critical approaches are [characterised by a **healthy
scepticism** towards accepted knowledge claims]{.underline} and dominant
ideas, [and instead, seek to **continuously question and
interrogate**]{.underline} that which is taken for granted. In
particular, [critical scholars are committed to interrogating how the
status quo is implicated in some of the very problems that traditional
theory seeks to solve, in this case, the 'problems' of conflict,
violence]{.underline}, lack of reconciliation and the like. In part,
this is because critical approaches recognise that knowledge and power
are intimately connected-- that knowledge is never neutral, but 'theory
is always for someone and for some purpose' (Cox 1981). Lastly, [in
contrast to the social scientific adoption of a **purportedly neutral
standpoint** on political and ethical issues, critical approaches are
characterised by an **openly ethical- normative commitment**
to]{.underline} human rights, [social justice, progressive politics, and
improving the lives of individuals and communities -- or what is often
called 'emancipation' or praxis]{.underline} (McDonald 2009).
[**Ontological commitments** What exactly are the things called
'conflict', 'peace', 'violence', 'terrorism',]{.underline} 'mediation',
'reconciliation' [and the like]{.underline}, that we study, [and how
should we conceive, understand and speak of them?]{.underline} An openly
critical approach would suggest that all of [these objects of study are
not free- standing, ontologically distinct phenomena discoverable by
**objective social scientific study**]{.underline}. [Instead, things
like 'peace', 'humanitarian intervention', 'cultural violence' or
'reconciliation' are social formations and sets of social activities
that are]{.underline} in large part **[contingent upon, and constituted
by, the]{.underline}** terms, languages and [**discourses** used to
describe and study them]{.underline}. [A concept like 'peace'
is]{.underline} actually 'an **[ontologically suspicious]{.underline}**
concept' (Elshtain quoted in Neufeld 1993: 172), and whether a
particular society is described as 'peaceful', 'post- conflict',
'reconciled', or 'violent' is not a value- free fact or 'truth' waiting
to be discovered by a scholar through the scientific method, but the
consequence of the operation of a series of academic, political and
social discourses, judgements and practices in different locales. In
other words, [there is a discursive, political, cultural and academic
process by which real world actors and processes are given meaning
through]{.underline} the negotiated application of different kinds of
[political and intellectual labels, categories and narratives,
including]{.underline} a set of [discursively constructed **measures by
which 'peacefulness' or 'violence' can be ranked**]{.underline}, or
groups judged to be 'spoilers', for example. [Such measurements are
**inherently ideological** in that they **prioritise some values over
others: direct violence over structural violence, order over social
justice**]{.underline}, dialogue over resistance. Moreover, [such
labels, concepts, categories and meanings are prone to **change and
contestation**]{.underline}; they never just 'speak for themselves'. In
terms of exactly what a 'conflict' consists of, for example, something
that started as a 'rebellion' might then become a 'terrorist campaign'
(or 'The troubles'), before being designated a 'civil war' (usually, by
virtue of reaching an arbitrary fatality threshold), a 'genocide' or a
'counter-insurgency campaign'. [This is not to say that critical
approaches do not recognise actual physical violence in the 'real world'
which is experienced]{.underline} by people [as 'civil war' or
'terrorism', or conditions of low direct violence which is understood as
'peace'. Rather,]{.underline} it is to adopt a Frankfurt School-
inspired ontology which maintains a 'minimal foundationalism' in which
the ontological distinction between subject and object is preserved, and
[discourse and materiality are conceptualised as **shaping each other in
a dialectical, never-ceasing dynamic**, rather than the one being solely
constituted by the other]{.underline} (Toros and Gunning 2009). Such an
ontological standpoint recognizes that there are observable
'regularities' in human activity (what positivists might call laws), and
that one can distinguish between different phenomena on the basis of
their delineated characteristics, while at the same time recognising
that these characteristics and how they are interpreted are a product of
their social and historical context and thus, are not 'objective facts'
in the positivist sense. Consequently, for critical scholars, the
acceptance of the relative ontological insecurity of analytical concepts
results in a real sensitivity to the politics of labelling and
categorising, and extreme care in the use of different terms during
research and teaching. However, critical approaches go even further,
recognising that [peace, conflict, violence, reconciliation and the like
are in themselves **constituted by social and political narratives,
discourses and practices**]{.underline}. As a consequence, critical
scholars are interested in the constitutive nature of norms, ideas and
other discursive elements which make the social practices of conflict,
violence, dialogue, peace and reconciliation possible in specific
historical and spatial contexts (Alkopher 2005: 716). In other words,
critical approaches suggest that [violent conflict cannot be fully
understood apart from the particular kinds of narratives, discourses and
social practices which **make it possible by rendering it conceivable,
legitimate and reasonable**]{.underline} (see Jabri 1996). Crucial to
this process is the role played by existing normative structures which
function to construct identities, interests and modes of social action
(Alkopher 2005: 720). Importantly, in addition to critical civil war
research (see Jackson 2014) within the conflict analysis side of the
field, a critical ontology which accepts the social construction and
inherent instability of the key concepts is also starting to inform
approaches to the study of peace (Richmond 2007, Shinko 2008) and
conflict resolution (Hansen 2008), among others. **[Epistemological
commitments]{.underline}** A critical epistemology accepts that creating
[knowledge is ultimately a social process which depends on a range of
contextual and process- related factors,]{.underline} not least the
social position of the researcher, the institutional context within
which they conduct their research, and the kinds of methods they employ.
[Such factors impact on the kinds of knowledge produced, as well as the
purposes to which it is ultimately put. Importantly, this **does not
mean that all knowledge about the social world is hopelessly insecure**,
that]{.underline} scholarly standards and procedures in [research should
be rejected]{.underline}, or that 'anchorages' -- relatively secure
knowledge claims -- cannot be found and built upon (Booth 2008).
[Rather, it suggests]{.underline} that CPR should be characterised by [a
**continuous and critical reflexivity** in regards to]{.underline} its
own [epistemology, methodology and assumptions.]{.underline} It also
means that [there are few if any knowledge claims about conflict,
violence, peace]{.underline}, reconciliation and the like [that cannot
be challenged or questioned]{.underline}. Related to this, a critical
perspective also recognises that [no individual]{.underline}, including
academic researchers, [can]{.underline} completely [put aside their
personal **identity, values, perceptions, and world view**]{.underline}
and then engage in purely objective, dispassionate, value- free
research. Rather, every researcher brings with them a particular culture
and set of values and understandings which shapes their research in
important ways. At the very least, critical scholars argue that
[recognising and acknowledging]{.underline} the [personal
subjectivity]{.underline} of the researcher [is an important
step]{.underline} (see Breen Smyth 2009), [not least because such
continuous reflexivity acts as an antidote to the **dangerous claim that
some kinds of knowledge are objective**]{.underline} and wholly
unbiased, [**and therefore superior** to others.]{.underline} Crucially,
such an epistemological stance does not entail a wholesale rejection of
the social scientific notion of objectivity, but instead accepts that
[there are multiple ways of knowing about]{.underline} objects of social
analysis, such as [conflicts or peace]{.underline} processes, that [it
is]{.underline} in any case [beyond the capacity of any single narrative
to provide the best account of such processes]{.underline}, and that
through a pluralisation of perspectives and their inevitable clashes a
more justifiable knowledge can be assembled (see Campbell 1998:
279--281). A critical approach therefore suggests that '[**continual
contestation**, rather than]{.underline} the aspirations of [synthesis
and totality, should be the aim of inquiry']{.underline} (ibid.: 281).

**Lupovici 21**

Amir, senior lecturer in the School of Political Science, Government and
International Affairs and a research fellow in the Blavatnik
Interdisciplinary Cyber Research Center. "The dual-use security dilemma
and the social construction of insecurity." *Contemporary Security
Policy*, 42(3), 257--285. pp. 7-11

[Threats are not simply given. They are constructed and shaped through
social dynamics.]{.underline} This does not mean that the objective
elements that affect insecurity are irrelevant. Rather, these [elements
are mediated through interpretation and carry effects through discourse
that identify the threat and justify the response]{.underline} (e.g.,
Lipschutz, 1995, pp. 1--23). [Actors, intentionally and unintentionally,
create social structures that produce (in)security and
threats.]{.underline} The dual-use dilemma is thus shaped by two
interrelated social mechanisms. [The first is the social production of
the dual-use qualities of the technology. The second is the actors'
construction of the technology of their opponents as an existential
threat]{.underline}, which is embedded in a broader social context that
includes the actors' relations, politics, identity, and history
andcontinues previous securitizing moves. [Through the combination of
these, actors construct uncertainty over whether their opponent's
technology is meant for civil or for military/harmful]{.underline} (and
potentially existentially [threatening) purposes, and thus they allocate
resources to address it.]{.underline} This is even if the opponent has
no plans for harmful or military application of the dual-use technology.
The [securitizing moves an actor takes may affect the security of other
actors]{.underline}, who in turn may take additional measures and
contribute to the spiraling escalation. The [concept of securitization
captures the social dynamics of insecurity.]{.underline} [Securitization
is a process through which an intersubjective understanding that
something is an existential threat is developed between a securitizing
actor (enunciator) and audience]{.underline}. This intersubjective
understanding allows the actor to call for exceptional measures to deal
with the threat (Buzan et al., 1998; see also Buzan & Hansen, 2009, pp.
212--217; Gad & Lund Petersen, 2011). A crucial element of this process
is [the speech act of security, as it is the utterance itself that
constitutes an issue as a security issue by labeling it as
such]{.underline} (Buzan et al., 1998, pp. 26--27). A number of
facilitating conditions related to the language used, the securitizing
actor, and the "conditions historically associated with the threat"
affect the speech act (Buzan et al., 1998, pp. 32--33; Floyd, 2010, p.
13). However, scholars have challenged the emphasis on the semantics of
security, pointing to the importance of images and to external
conditions affecting the securitizing move that are not related to
language (e.g., Vuori, 2008; Williams, 2003). It should also be noted
that while the concept of securitization was originally developed to
explore the constitutive elements of "new" security issues, such as
migration, epidemics, and the environment (Balzacq & Guzzini, 2015;
Buzan & Hansen, 2009, p. 215), scholars have begun using this theory to
study "traditional" security issues (Hayes, 2013; Lupovici, 2019; Roe,
2008; Vuori, 2008). I follow this line of studies, and especially Van
Rythoven's (2020) article.4 Van Rythoven uses the concept of
securitization dilemma to explore the unintended consequences of the
security dilemma dynamics. Among other things, he aims to highlight how
this concept bridges traditional and constructivist theories of
security, and to justify epistemologically and conceptually the
combining of the security dilemma with securitization scholarship.5 Van
Rythoven provides a promising point of departure to incorporate
securitization theory into the study of the security dilemma. First, he
defines the [securitization dilemma as "a difficult choice where a
securitizing move represents a powerful and attractive opportunity for
political mobilization, but with the danger of perverse and unintended
consequence]{.underline}" (2020,, p. 479). In short, the focus of the
dilemma is [diverted to the question of whether to securitize or
not]{.underline}. Second, [securitization theory also allows the
capturing of different non-traditional kinds of threat, and not just
threats to sovereignty, that initiate the security dilemma for different
kinds of actors (and not just to state actors)]{.underline} (Van
Rythoven, 2020, p. 484). I further elaborate on Van Rythoven's
assertions by acknowledging the spiral dynamics of securitizing moves.
For Van Rythoven, a key aspect of the dilemma is the [unexpected
consequences of a securitizing move]{.underline}. He highlights the
[uncertainty that surrounds securitizing moves, as enunciators cannot
know whether the audience will accept them or what the impact will be of
implementing the practices stemming from these moves]{.underline} (Van
Rythoven, 2020, pp. 486--488). While all these [uncertainties are
important, another key, and underdeveloped, question is how securitizing
moves affect other actors]{.underline}. I argue that this dynamic may
create a spiral of insecurity where actors respond with a securitizing
move to a securitizing move initiated by another actor, thus affecting
both actors' security. Important to understanding security dilemma
dynamics is the acknowledgement that [securitization is a process rather
than a single act]{.underline} (Roe, 2008, pp. 617--618, 624; Watson,
2011, p. 10). Recognizing this allows us to consider the political
context in which securitizing moves are embedded, as well as the
political effects of securitizing moves (Buzan et al., 1998, p. 25;
Guzzini, 2011, p. 331; Hayes, 2013, pp. 16--17). A number of scholars
have extended these ideas by considering the different dynamics through
which the same security issue is repeatedly securitized. They explore
the concept of re-securitization, when an already-securitized issue is
put back on the agenda (Mavelli, 2012, p. 190; McDonald, 2011) or
attains a new climax (Lupovici, 2016). Scholars have also explored the
international effects of securitizing moves. Beyond domestic
consequences, [securitizing moves' political effects and outcomes
influence other actors, who respond to them as a result of either the
rhetoric employed or the behavior triggered]{.underline} (Buzan et al.,
1998, pp. 205--206; see also Lupovici, 2019; Wæver, 2011, p. 476).
Especially important for capturing dynamics around [the chain reaction
of a security dilemma is a counter-securitizing move, which occurs when
actors resist a securitizing move]{.underline}. Actors can resist a
securitizing move in different ways,6 and against different elements of
the targeted securitizing move (Stritzel & Chang, 2015, pp. 551--552).
Although Stritzel and Chang (2015, p. 553) do not specifically connect
their discussion to the security dilemma, they argue that "\[a\]n
explicitly interactive reading of processes of securitization versus
counter-securitization ... can establish fruitful conversations
specifically with military strategy." Thinking of securitizing moves as
part of an iterating process that affects other (international) actors
captures the essence of the security dilemma (Table 1). The [traditional
security dilemma is fueled by the "objective" characteristics of the
means acquired by the actors and focuses on whether to arm to prepare
for an emerging threat, even though the act of arming may itself be
threatening to the opponent.]{.underline} Conversely, the
[securitization approach to the security dilemma focuses on the actors'
spiraling constructions of insecurity.]{.underline} From this
perspective, a [security dilemma erupts when an issue is securitized and
counter-securitized by rival actors]{.underline}. An [actor's
securitizing move is constructed as an existential threat by another
actor and thus it is spirally aggravated]{.underline}. The
securitization approach of the dilemma is based on the view that, on the
one hand, a [securitizing move may be advantageous for the securitizing
actor by mobilizing support for extraordinary measures, legitimizing
their response to an opponent's challenge or, alternatively, winning
them some domestic political gains.]{.underline} On the other hand, the
[move itself may invite the opponent to make securitizing moves of its
own.]{.underline} The result may be a [spiral dynamic in which each
actor conducts a securitizing move where they securitize the
securitizing move taken by an opponent.]{.underline} The dilemma then is
whether to securitize and enjoy the benefits of it while also facing the
risk of negatively influencing other actors or providing tools for the
opponent to perform securitizing moves of their own. When the means
Actor A holds or develops (or even the rhetoric related to these
processes) are constructed by Actor B as an existential threat and Actor
B can justify taking extraordinary measures to address the alleged
insecurity, then Actor B contributes to the dynamics of the security
dilemma. In turn, Actor A may securitize Actor B's response---that is,
Actor B's securitizing move is securitized by Actor A. More
specifically, Actor A may construct a number of things as an existential
threat: (1) Actor B's construction (labeling the means acquired by Actor
A as an existential threat); (2) Actor B's justification to take
extraordinary measures; or (3) Actor B's execution of the measures
legitimized through the securitizing move. Securitizing of any of these
issues by Actor A can lead to attempts to justify additional means Actor
A should take and can expedite attaining the means of threat to Actor B
that have already been justified. The securitized issue becomes part of
the opponent's securitizing move: it provides a pretext for enunciators
to perform their own securitizing move and it also gives both sides
tools to further securitize the situation, and so on. This creates the
dangerous spiral dynamic. Each securitizing move---and the ensuing
extraordinary measures---becomes a strong justification for the opponent
to re-securitize the opponent's moves and attain a new securitization
climax. I build on a securitization reading of the traditional security
dilemma to present the dual-use security dilemma (see Table 2).
Basically, the [dilemma in the latter is whether to securitize an
opponent's dual-use technology]{.underline}. On the one hand, by
[securitizing these technologies, an actor can attain domestic support
and legitimacy for policy measures, including measures addressing the
(constructed) threat]{.underline} Conversely, the securitizing move
itself, apart from any execution of these measures, may alarm an
opponent or even provide it a pretext for its own securitizing moves,
thus initiating a spiral dynamic of insecurity. This may especially be
tragic in situations where the actor whose dual-use technology was first
securitized had no plans to use the technology for military/harmful
purposes. I suggest that the [dual-use security dilemma is shaped by two
kinds of social dynamics]{.underline}. First, social processes shape
whether and how a technology can be seen as dual-use. Second, [once a
technology is seen as dual-use, enunciators are able to rely on this
knowledge to further securitize it.]{.underline}

### Benign Warfighting

#### The 1ACs image of benign war-fighting is an age-old tactic enabling innocent domination on the periphery. By placing military benevolence on a pedestal, the aff assigns hegemonic security priestly powers culminating in genocidal sacrifice on the periphery.

Diplomacy, "Americans Can't Give Up the Cult of War"

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [accomplished its
goals]{.underline} in the Afghan war [when]{.underline} a team of [Navy
SEALs stormed]{.underline} Osama [bin Laden's Pakistani compound and
gave him a]{.underline} richly deserved [bullet to the
head]{.underline}. [So why is the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [still there?]{.underline} [America
has]{.underline} clearly [gotten its pound of flesh]{.underline}.
**[There are]{.underline}** **[now]{.underline}** **[more Sunni Islamist
militants than ever]{.underline}**. [Never-ending deployments place
massive strains on personnel, drain resources]{.underline}, and divert
funding needed for modernization so the United States remains
competitive versus its peer adversaries.

Yet despite this, **[America's forever wars seem unlikely to end anytime
soon]{.underline}**. And **[their purpose has
transformed]{.underline}**. Like much else in U.S. foreign policy, the
**[geopolitical purpose is secondary]{.underline}** **[to the pride and
ceremony]{.underline}** involved. Americans may bristle at the
insinuation that they are engaged in ritual bloodshed. But the facts
point that way. [If victory was seen as a pressing national
priority]{.underline}, then [the fact that only 56 percent of Afghan
territory is under friendly control]{.underline} more than 17 years into
the war [should be viewed as a national scandal]{.underline} and
disgrace.

[If the costs of war were viewed as unacceptable]{.underline} by the
U.S. government and public, **[it would be over]{.underline}**.
Likewise, if the United States well and truly desired to be rid of
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, he would have been killed a long time
ago, yet he continues to cross American "red lines" and gas his citizens
with more or less impunity. (The occasional Tomahawk being a perfectly
acceptable price for the regime in exchange for the destruction of its
enemies and the reclamation of its territory.)

But **[while victory is not a priority]{.underline}**, **[defeat is
unacceptable]{.underline}**. As President Donald Trump once put it,
"winners aren't losers," and [America's homegrown blood cult has
reached]{.underline} such [a frenzied height]{.underline} that
[admitting defeat is tantamount to heresy]{.underline}, [even if
stopping]{.underline} the [wars]{.underline} [would save]{.underline}
the [lives]{.underline} of actual soldiers. In other words, **[while the
wars are a bottomless pit]{.underline}** in terms of grand strategy,
**[they serve a domestic socio-political need]{.underline}**.

The **[wars serve as a]{.underline}** grand **[ritual of]{.underline}**
American **[civil religion in which sacrifice and martyrdom are props
for]{.underline}** a vision of the **[imperium]{.underline}**, **[even
at the cost of the empire's actual strategic objectives]{.underline}**.
The **[troops are symbolic avatars for]{.underline}** American
**[values]{.underline}**, but as **[actual human beings]{.underline}**,
they **[are expendable]{.underline}**. [Not only does]{.underline}
[conflict provide an enemy to define America against]{.underline},
**[but warfare itself is]{.underline}** seen as **[a crucible in which
the national character is defined and]{.underline}** **[the soldier
placed in the role of Christ]{.underline}**, expected **[to redeem
America through his]{.underline}** (and in the popular imagination, it
is always his, not her) **[suffering]{.underline}**.

As in reality, war tends to be unpleasant, and actual interaction with
the wars and their consequences is kept to a minimum, largely restrained
to using veterans and the military as set-piece props and video
game-like footage of airstrikes on cable news. [This]{.underline}
[reverential detachment is]{.underline} [necessary to
maintain]{.underline} what the theologian Jon Pahl calls ["innocent
domination,"]{.underline} which he defines as "systems of domination,
hegemony, or power ... that are largely absent of malice on the part of
the perpetrators." **[The United States is]{.underline}**, in Pahl's
words, **[an "empire of sacrifice]{.underline}**." The magnitude of the
backlash against Trump's plans to withdraw from Syria from a normally
supine Republican Party and the speed of the president's backpedaling
demonstrate how deeply ingrained this ritual is in American life.

Thus, Colin Kaepernick's kneeling is seen as heresy despite not even
being meant as an insult to the military, whereas the president
attempting to dismantle veterans' healthcare barely registers as a minor
scandal. The American public asks service members to fight in wars it
does not believe in and for which no credible plans for victory have
been presented, and in exchange they get to fly F-15s over the Super
Bowl and consume free hot wings and martinis once a year at Applebee's.
This does not seem like an equitable bargain.

To be clear, the military is far from blameless. Indeed, pressure from
military commanders has caused both Trump and former President Barack
Obama to continue these campaigns against their own inclinations.
**[Nobody wants to be the president who lost a war.]{.underline}**

**[The transformation of veterans]{.underline}** and retired **[generals
and admirals into a]{.underline}** sort of **[secular priesthood is
not]{.underline}** an **[encouraging]{.underline}** development,
particularly when the military is the last remaining federal institution
with bipartisan support. **[America]{.underline}**, like the Aztecs,
**[seems destined to fall deeper]{.underline}** and deeper **[into
naval-gazing bloodletting as a bizarre ritual of symbolic
primacy]{.underline}**.

### Cyber Security

#### Cybersecurity discourse relies on objective "experts" whose true purpose is to constantly displace the structural causes of insecurity- the result is an endless set of recommendations that reaffirm the militaristic ideology of the status quo

**Jacobsen 20**

Jeppe Teglskov, assistant professor at the Institute for Military
Technology, Royal Danish Defence College. "From neurotic citizen to
hysteric security expert: a Lacanian reading of the perpetual demand for
US cyber defence." Critical Studies on Security. 3/1/2020. Pg 1-10. LJS

The goals of security policy experts -- a term used collectively here to
describe independent consultants and think tankers that produce policy
recommendations and advise the US Administration -- keep shifting. A
case in point is the extensive policy discussion on cyber deterrence.
[Improving deterrence of cyberattacks against the US has been a
recommendation put forward by task forces and commissions at regular
intervals]{.underline} during the Obama Administration (National
Research Council 2010; CSIS 2017; DSB 2013; DSB. 2017). The
Administration's attempts to accommodate these recommendations have
invariably been met by new and different sets of proposals and demands,
and a reluctance on the part of experts in the cyber community to stand
by previous policy proposals. By way of a brief summary, elaborated
further in the body of this article: Before 2010, policy experts called
for more offensive cyber capabilities to ensure a cyber deterrence
posture. Around the time that the Administration provided these
capabilities, [the cyber deterrence problem ceased to be attributed to a
cyber capability problem and was now thought to result from a lack of
signalling]{.underline}. Shortly thereafter, [the Administration
responded by signalling a willingness to respond strongly to
cyberattacks, at which point the expert community began calling instead
for resilience]{.underline} in both civilian and military US networks to
achieve cyber deterrence. [This demand for cyber resilience was put
forward in such vague terms that it is impossible to determine when it
is achieved.]{.underline}¶ [The dependency on increasingly complex
socio-technical systems in contemporary society has rendered reliance on
experts unavoidable.]{.underline} And with their rise to ubiquity in
policy circles, expertise has also become a frequent object of study in
social sciences. In critical security studies, the sociological
approaches have been particularly attuned to the study of expertise.
[Within this field, security scholars have focused largely on how the
everyday practices of professional experts play a role in categorising
what constitutes an insecurity -- and ultimately, in (re)producing
particular 'regimes of truth']{.underline} (Bigo 2002; Berling and
Bueger 2015). In so doing, these contributions see experts as the
embodiments of specific forms of knowledge that is practised or
articulated as part of a dominant rationality of government (or
dispositif or field). This article introduces a strategy for studying
security policy experts that does not reduce the expert to the
embodiment of a knowledge regime or a tool for political interests. It
suggests that [paying attention to how the expert subject identifies
with and performs its role as an expert vis-à-vis the government that
takes policy decisions, advances our understanding of the expert's role
in reproducing insecurities.]{.underline}¶ The article takes its cue
from the writings of those critical security scholars that show how
today's risk governance has led to increasing public awareness and
general concerns in society about unpredictable and catastrophic events
(Aradau and van Munster 2011; Aradau, Lobo-Guerrero, and van Munster
2008). Such concerns about uncertainty, the critical security scholars
argue, have not only led to the government introducing precautionary and
pre-emptive strategies for governing security but has also given rise to
anxious and neurotic subjects (De Goede 2008; Walklate and Mythen 2010;
Eklundh, Zevnik, and Guittet 2017). Scholarly contributions within this
field have so far almost exclusively diagnosed the neurotic subject
among citizens being governed. [In fact, the neurotic subject is treated
somewhat disconnected from or even juxtaposed to the experts that
implement or propose the current security governing strategies and thus
can be said to mobilise collective anxieties]{.underline} (Fournier
2014). [Experts are, apparently, unaffected by anxieties about future
uncertainties. This article extends the notion of the neurotic subject
to the expert, and asks: How does a reading of the expert as a neurotic
subject advance the way we study the reproduction of
insecurities?]{.underline}¶ For answering this question, the
Freudian-inspired work on the neurotic citizen by Isin (2004), which is
the main inspiration for the above-mentioned turn to anxiety and
neurosis in the risk literature, is a useful stepping-stone. However,
the article switches the theoretical point of departure from Freud to
Jacques Lacan -- the latter of which enjoys increasing attention in
critical security studies recently (Mandelbaum 2016; Heath-Kelly 2018;
Danil 2018; Eberle 2019). To date, the Lacanian contributions within
this literature have generally introduced Lacan's notion of the divided
subject -- and one or a few concepts related to it -- to extend the
analytical power of existing critical security and IR approaches
(Epstein 2011). However, Lacan offers a -- largely unexplored1 --
systematic strategy for locating and studying the divided subject in
different social relations, his matrix of the 'Four Discourses' (Lacan
1998, 2007).¶ The article zooms in on one of the four discourses,
Lacan's discourse of the hysteric, introducing it as an analytical
strategy for studying policy experts as neurotic subjects. Lacan defines
the Four Discourses as abstract ways to structure our communication and
identification. The Hysteric Discourse, one of the four discourses, is a
social bond where a neurotic subject constantly protests and demands
that an 'other', in the position of the master signifier, delivers what
the subject desires (for example, absolute security) (Fink 1995,
129--37). The article focuses on US policy experts in the field of cyber
defence.2 US cyber defence is as an apt case study not only because
'cyber' is officially considered the biggest threat to US national
security, but also because cyberspace is articulated in the US as an
uncertain, unpredictable and insecure domain where governments rely on
assistance from outside experts to solve problems (Dunn Cavelty 2013;
Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009). As the neurotic subject is likely to emerge
from uncertainty and as experts hold a privileged position in the cyber
policy debate, the social bond between the US cyber defence experts and
the government is an ideal case for examining the expert as a neurotic
subject that communicates through the Hysteric Discourse as well as what
it means for the reproduction of insecurity.¶ Through the case study of
the US cyber policy experts, the article contributes to the emerging
body of critical security studies on experts. It introduces a
Lacanian-inspired hysteric strategy for advancing the analysis of
security experts. First, the article locates the drifting of desire in
the public expert documents on cyber deterrence and argues that the US
cyber policy experts' ever-evolving and ultimately elusive demands are
illustrative of a desire for a desire unfulfilled, which reproduces
cyber insecurity as a national defence priority. And second, the article
shows that the social bond between the cyber policy expert subject and
the US government is sustained -- despite the former taking up
employment in the executive branch -- by the subject pushing the object
of desire in front of it to the point of ultimately returning to the
position as outside experts. Together, the two readings illustrate a
critical security strategy for studying the reproduction of insecurity
through the experts' neurotic identification as experts.¶ The article
comes in three sections. First, it situates the study of security
expertise in the critical literature on risk and uncertainty. Second, it
introduces Lacan's hysteric social bond as a strategy for studying the
subject, and third, it illustrates how to apply this strategy through a
case study of US cyber defence experts.¶ Security experts and expertise
in critical studies on risk and uncertainty ¶ The study of experts and
expertise in International Relations and security studies is not new. A
focus on scientific experts preoccupied IR functionalists of the 1960s
as did the concept of 'epistemic communities' in the early 1990s where
the primary interest was to explore the causal mechanisms by which
experts exert influence over security policy. More recently, critical
security approaches also turned their attention to the study of experts
and expertise (Berling and Bueger 2015, 3--6).¶ [The main analytical
task of these scholars has been to highlight the contested and
contingent ground upon which expertise is constructed and
exercised]{.underline}. Leander (2014) offers an excellent example of
the contestation and controversies over the production of expert
knowledge in the case of the 2013 Sarin gas attack in Syria. And
scholars such as Büger and Villumsen (2007) have shown repeatedly how
'facts' are produced through a web of practices. The production relates,
for example, to the network of peace researchers, US policy-makers, NATO
officials and bureaucrats that stabilised the 'democratic peace thesis',
or to the practice of quantification, expert monitoring groups, and
special advisors, which generate a specific form of knowledge on piracy
(Bueger 2015). Similarly, a group of security scholars -- the so-called
Paris School -- approaches security as a professional struggle between
experts (the managers of unease), who, through their bureaucratic,
everyday practices and routines, define what counts as insecurity (Bigo
2002; Huysmans 2006; Bigo and Tsoukala 2008). Whether drawing on the
work of Bourdieu, Foucault or Actor-Network Theory, the existing
contributions tend either to reduce security experts to the 'scientific
knowledge' and tools for 'political interests' or to treat security
experts as passive deployers of security techniques.¶ This tendency is
particularly present in the many studies of security governance through
risk. [Here, the attention to technologies that represent the tools for
generating 'objective' knowledge about risks has not only pushed the
experts developing, proposing the use of, or applying the technologies
to the background, but has also directed the analytical lens primarily
towards the production of bionic subject-positions of those being 'risk
managed]{.underline}'. Amoore and de Goede (2008, 9--10) call the
current usage of data-driven (surveillance) technologies to identify
risky bodies and bodies at risk, the 'techno-expert deployment of risk'.
[Biometric technologies are the prime example of the dominant mode of
risk management, and they are used to illustrate how the technologies,
rather than addressing the political subject, govern bodies with the aim
of controlling the future through enforcing the (political) status-quo
in the present]{.underline} (Bell 2006; Epstein 2008). But while experts
are not the focus of these analyses, the literature on
security-governance-through-risk contains an opening to ask new
questions about security experts.¶ Critical risk scholars such as Aradau
and van Munster (2011) argue that governing through calculation and
management of the future has fostered public concern about unknowable,
future catastrophes, such as terrorism and natural disasters. This
increasing focus on unknowable disasters and worst-case scenarios, some
scholars have suggested, renders the subject neurotic and anxious (De
Goede 2008; Walklate and Mythen 2010; Fournier 2014). The neurotic
subject was first discussed in the context of risk by Isin, who draws on
Freudian insights to account for citizens' acceptance of the social
effects of neoliberalism. Isin (2004, 225--6) argues that the subject
called upon to adjust its conduct in times of emerging risks is not 'a
rational, calculating or competent subject' but an affective subject
that needs 'soothing, appeasing and tranquillizing' to manage anxieties.
The neurotic subject-citizen speaks and makes demands: It wants the
impossible (absolute security and safety) and is presented with new
solutions to manage its affects (ibid: 232). The critical security
contributions that find inspiration in Isin's work all locate anxiety
and neurosis at the level of the citizens who are being risk managed and
in juxtaposition to the experts and government officials that mobilise
these anxieties (Fournier 2014: 315--7; De Goede 2008; Eklundh, Zevnik,
and Guittet 2017).¶ Charlotte Heath-Kelly (2018) has taken an important
initial step towards moving beyond the dichotomy between experts who
mobilise anxiety and the anxious subject. She examines the role of
anxiety among those experts and government officials who are in a
position of securitising issues and who practice security towards
various threat objects. With the change in focus, she has also switched
the psychoanalytic starting point from Freud to Lacan. She introduces
Lacan's divided (or split) subject and related concepts such as drive,
anxiety, enjoyment, and lack and applies them to the War on Terror to
understand the continuous invention of new threat objects that occurs as
soon as the old ones are destroyed (ibid.).¶ Building on Heath-Kelly's
argument that the subject repeatedly invents insecurities to avoid
confronting an ontological lack/insecurity, the next section proposes to
situate the subject in Lacan's most formalised methodological matrix,
his 'Four Discourses'. Lacan's Discourses do no refer to specific
content (e.g. legal, political, medical, etc.) but can be understood as
structuring different social bonds between the subject and the social
field, i.e. different modes of communication through which the subject
identifies. The following section introduces the divided subject and
develops an analytical strategy for approaching the neurotic
expert-subject through a particular social bond, Lacan's discourse of
the hysteric.¶ From divided subject to hysteric social bond: introducing
a new reading strategy¶ Lacan was one of the 20th century thinkers who
worked most extensively with the subject. The novelty of Lacan is the
way in which he unites three distinct definitions of the subject: the
liberal acting subject, the subject of structuralism and the subject of
the unconscious. The conventional understanding of the subject is the
Cartesian acting subject, often exemplified in the (to Lacan, imaginary)
idea of being a whole and autonomous 'self' that forms the environment.
The opposite conception of the subject is the subject that is subjected
to the socio-symbolic structures of society. This subject is the product
of -- or subject position formed by -- for example, a legal, medical or
political discourse. Lacan introduces a third subject, which allows him
to account for why the subject identifies with the socio-symbolic
structures in the first place. He calls it the subject of the
unconscious. This subject represents a 'pre-subjective' part of the
individual that cannot flawlessly pass into the subject -- it represents
the failure to become the subject. The unconscious takes its form as a
nonsymbolisable residual that keeps the subject desiring and identifying
with new objects (Fink 1995, 36--48). In other words, the Lacanian
subject -- when emerging in the socio-symbolic order to assume an
identity -- cannot escape an ontological lack that is the inevitable
result of being positioned in the gap/void between the other two
subjects.¶ Turning to Lacan's divided subject has analytical
implications. It becomes a core task for the Lacanian analysis to
identify where the subject is positioned in a social context, and how
this position allows the subject to cope with or avoid confronting its
own dividedness. With his Four Discourses, Lacan seeks to codify the
various positions that the subject can take in different social bonds.
The Four Discourses -- the Master, University, Analyst and Hysteric
Discourse -- can be thought of as abstract ideal-types for how social
relations and identifications play out (Lacan 1998: 14--25, 2007,
11--68). Lacan's Discourses are condensed formula-based models (called
mathemes), which are made up by four positions (agent, other, product,
and repressed truth) and four elements (master signifier, system of
signification/knowledge, divided subject, and objet petit a), whose
relations make up four different social bonds (commanding,
indoctrinating, transforming, and protesting) (Žižek 2004, 131--57).
Introducing every matheme is unfortunately beyond the scope of this
article. It therefore focuses on one of the discourses, the Hysteric
Discourse, and unpacks its conceptual relations and social bonds in
order to develop a strategy for studying the expert as a neurotic
subject.¶ [The decision to study experts through the Hysteric Discourse
rather than the University Discourse, in which neutral knowledge speaks,
echoes the attempt]{.underline} -- motivated in the previous section [--
to move from studying security experts as the embodiments of a specific
risk/security governance regime]{.underline} (a system of knowledge) [to
studying experts as neurotic (divided) subjects.]{.underline} Lacan,
like Freud, regards the hysteric as one of the two ways of being
neurotic, the other being the obsessional neurotic. Before proceeding,
however, it is important to emphasise that the subject, when located in
a hysteric social bond, does not refer to a pathological or clinical
personality type, but refers to a position occupied within a
socio-symbolic system of meaning. Let me now introduce the hysteric
social bond as an interpretive strategy for empirical analyses. [A
social relation resembles a hysteric social bond when a speaking agent
deals with uncertainties and doubt by demanding that someone else does
something about these feelings, and when this 'other' responds to the
demands and protests by producing new knowledge and
solutions]{.underline} (Fink 1995, 133). Importantly, the fundamental
Lacanian assumption is that every social bond is driven by unconscious
force, a repressed 'truth' that determines how the subject copes with
its dividedness. In the Hysteric Discourse, this repressed truth is what
Lacan calls objet petit a -- the object cause of desire.¶ Objet petit a
is one of Lacan's most ambiguous concepts. In simple terms, it
represents the empty position that a lost object can occupy, i.e. the
position that allows an object to be currently unobtainable and hence
desired. To the subject, a lost object occupying this position holds the
promise of full enjoyment, i.e. a complete, secure identity, when
reached. Hence, the lost object claims to symbolise the nonsymbolisable
lack that remains when the subject attempts to assume an identity. In
other words, objet petit a stands for the void or gap that causes desire
by holding no positive content (Lacan 2007: 42--4, 176--9). When the
objet petit a is repressed as in the hysteric social bond, the subject
avoids directly confronting its desire and ultimately the ontological
lack at the heart of its being. In empirical analyses, the function of
objet petit a becomes visible, for example, as the drifting of desire
from one (lost) object to the next with the illusory expectation that
every new desired object symbolises and holds the power to overcome what
is lacking in the subject/ socio-symbolic universe.¶ In the hysteric
social bond, repressing or avoiding confrontation with objet petit a is
a defence mechanism supported by anxiety. If the subject were to
confront objet petit a, it would come to see itself in a new light,
ultimately ripping it out of the comfort of communicating and
identifying through the existing social bond. Thus, contrary to how this
term is commonly understood, anxiety for Lacan is associated neither
with the loss of an object nor with what is absent or uncertain. Rather,
anxiety is an expression of presence -- of not having in place a lost
object (Lacan 2014; Burgess 2017, 29). It is the lack of a symbolisable
lack: anxiety is the moment when the subject gets too close to objet
petit a. Thus, in the hysteric social bond, anxiety emerges at the
prospect of the 'other' delivering what the subject desires, and pushes
desire along.¶ The constant drift of desire ensured by anxiety in the
Hysteric Discourse is both a productive and a conservative force. It is
productive because it forces the 'other' to constantly improve its
efforts in response to the subject's demands and criticisms, and it is
conservative in that the repression of objet petit a prevents the
discursive configuration from being questioned and challenged. Following
this logic, the worst that can happen to the hysteric social bond is if
the 'other' caves to the criticism and gives up its position as the
master who produces new solutions. This would force the subject to take
responsibility for its own choices and decisions, and ultimately,
confront its own desire.¶ The hysteric social bond offers an analytical
strategy for locating and interpreting how the subject communicates and
identifies in particular (security political) contexts. From the above,
the initial analytical step is to locate a relationship that resembles a
social bond between, on the one hand, an agent that makes demand and
criticises and, on the other hand, a master that responds to these
demands by producing solutions. The hysteric social bond then directs
the analyst's attention to the way the object of desire manifests itself
empirically, including when the social bond seems to break down. The
hysteric bond is particularly relevant to the security political
analysis because the constant reinvention and articulation of a desired
object that promises security when attained reproduces a present sense
of insecurity.¶ The next section examines how the object of desire
manifests itself, first, in the expert communication through policy
recommendations on cyber deterrence made during and in the aftermath of
the Obama Administration, and second, in a situation where the hysteric
social bond breaks down, as it can be said to do when the cyber policy
experts take up positions as secretaries, ambassadors or advisors within
government. In both analyses, the article zooms in on the processes
through which the expert subject avoids confronting objet petit a and
how this avoidance ensures 'cyber' as a pertinent national defence
issue.¶ The expert subject's demand for cyber defence¶ [Experts
supposedly offer impartially and evidence-based knowledge and lay out
possible ways forward]{.underline}. Experts are not enmeshed in
normative partisan politics. At least, US think tanks emerged in the
beginning of the 20th century on this foundation (Rich 2004, 34--41).
Traces of this ideal still exist, although there are clear political
divisions across US think tanks today (Abelson 2018). [In the ongoing
policy debates on how to defend the nation in cyberspace, non-partisan
task forces and commissions put forward policy recommendations based on
their 'objective' assessment of the nature of cyberspace and the actors
acting within it.]{.underline} One of the most iterated recommendations
revolves around how to achieve credible cyber deterrence.¶ Yet, the next
subsection reviews the policy recommendations related to cyber
deterrence made by commissions and task forces during the Obama
Administration and in doing so, challenges the idea of experts as
nothing but the embodiments of a dominant knowledge regime. The first
subsection reads the relationship between policy expert and government
as a hysteric social bond where cyber deterrence is kept out of reach by
constantly changing demands or demands that are articulated so vaguely
that they are impossible for the government to meet. The second
subsection analyses the US cyber policy experts' entry into the
government as a break with the hysteric social bond that risks forcing
the neurotic subject to confront its own desire, but it shows that such
a move is accompanied by a constant reinvention of excuses as to why the
expert-turned-master is unable to provide the cyber defence it is
responsible for, ultimately leading to a definition of the object of
desire as that which the subject cannot currently do: criticise and make
demands. In this way, the hysteric social bond between experts who
reproduce insecurities through demands for policy change and a
government that seeks to accommodate these demands is sustained.¶ The
desire for a desire unfulfilled¶ At the end of 2008, the Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) brought together policy
experts to develop cybersecurity recommendation for the incoming
president. Under the headline 'Military Doctrine and Deterrence', the
commission report emphasised the importance of 'the need for a credible
military presence in cyberspace to provide a deterrent against potential
attackers' (CSIS 2008, 24). The following quote from the report,
however, calls in to question the commission's own recommendation:
Deterrence in cyberspace is particularly complicated because of the
problems with attribution and identification. If a country does not know
who is attacking, it is difficult to create appropriate and
proportionate responses in ways that reduce the chance of escalation. A
signal that a country is contemplating a response that goes to all
potential attackers will not deter and could actually create more
conflict (ibid.: 26[). In short, if the attacker is not attributable and
hence does not fear retaliation, then even the most potent cyber
military is superfluous. To make a policy recommendation and in the same
breath call into question the soundness of this policy is a hysteric
communication par excellence. It avoids the anxiety that emerges when
the specific object of desire (offensive military capabilities) is
achieved by already introducing a new object of desire (better
attribution).]{.underline}¶ Tellingly, the Administration's decision to
establish the US Cyber Command, the cyber branch of the US military, was
immediately criticised as insufficient. CSIS director James Lewis
underlined, for example, that 'the U.S. is widely recognized to have
pre-eminent offensive cyber capabilities, but it obtains little or no
deterrent effect from this' (cited in Markoff, Sanger, and Shanker
2010). In other words, the government should do a better job defending
against and identifying the culprits in cyberspace.¶ Then Deputy
Secretary of Defense, William J. Lynn III was ready with a plan for
improving cyber defence capacities. Presenting the Department's cyber
strategy, Lynn underlined that '\[US cyber\] deterrence will necessarily
be based more on denying any benefit to attackers than on imposing costs
through retaliation' (Lynn III 2010, 99--100). The newfound priority of
cyber defence did not appear to reassure the expert subject. As a case
in point, the National Research Council (NRC) hosted a 2010 workshop
with policy experts on cyber deterrence. And shortly after, the
independent Defense Science Board (DSB) created a task force on
Resilient Military System and the Advanced Cyber Threat to provide
recommendations on how to maintain deterrence in the cyber era. Neither
the NRC workshop nor the DSB report found offensive cyber capabilities
or cyber defence to be the solution to the cyber deterrence problem.
Instead, the desired object had drifted along: Now, the Administration
needs to clearly articulate the willingness and the capacity to respond
to cyberattacks not only with cyber weapons but with all available tools
-- ultimately nuclear weapons (DSB 2013: 15; Rosenzweig 2010, 247).¶
Articulating the willingness to respond to cyberattacks with any means
was first introduced by the Obama Administration in the 2011
International Strategy for Cyberspace and subsequently iterated in both
the Department of Defense (2015) Cyber Strategy as well as in a White
House cyber deterrence white paper of late 2015 (Obama 2011: 14;
Department of Defense 2015: 11; Otto 2015). However, as is prototypical
in a hysteric social bond, getting close to the object of desire -- that
is, having more steadfast articulations about the willingness to
retaliate -- causes anxiety that prompts a slide towards a new object of
desire. In this case, manifesting in a redefinition of the meaning of
cyber deterrence.¶ Two subsequent commission reports on cyber
deterrence, namely the CSIS cyber recommendations to President Trump and
the 2017 DSB follow-up report on cyber deterrence (CSIS 2017a; DSB.
2017), no longer focused only on large-scale cyberattacks against the US
critical infrastructures as that which needed to be deterred. In fact,
the government's cyber deterrence's efforts including the articulation
of a willingness to respond with all means necessary seemed to have
worked, as no serious, crippling cyberattacks against US critical
infrastructures had taken place -- despite the experts' continuous
criticisms of US national cyber insecurity. What the US did not prevent,
however, was economic cyber espionage and minor, non-destructive
disturbances of public and private networks. Thus, in the new commission
reports, the anxiety over such malicious cyber activity was now included
as that which needed to be deterred. Once again, anxiety pushes desire
along, now in the form of a desire for better defining a proportional
response to cyberattacks on private entities and economic espionage.
This drift to better declaratory policy also offers an explanation as to
why the government -- when it finally delivered on the previous demand
for better attribution -- failed to satisfy the expert's desire for
cyber deterrence. In 2014, the US successfully attributed and indicted
Chinese government hackers for commercial cyber espionage, but as the
expert's desire for cyber deterrence now involved a desire for a strong
national security response to cyber espionage, the US government's
attributions only reinforced the demands for economic sanctions
(Nakashima 2015).¶ [In short, as soon as the government delivers, the
expert subject's desire shifts, from offensive military capabilities in
cyberspace to better attribution, to an articulation of willingness to
respond, and most recently, to the need to define proportional responses
to non-military cyber activity. With the drift, the cyber threat
continues as a pertinent national security challenge -- to which the
solution remains always just out of reach.]{.underline}

### Cyber Security -- China

#### Articulating Chinese threats to cybersecurity papers over the internal sociopolitical contradictions present in the United States, serving to create a homogenized understanding of both countries that ultimately results in more threats and insecurity

**Jacobsen 20**

Jeppe Teglskov, assistant professor at the Institute for Military
Technology, Royal Danish Defence College. "Lacan in the US cyber
defence: Between public discourse and transgressive practice." Review of
International Studies. 2020. Pg 10-18. LJS

[In short, the US cyber defence community represents China's behaviour
in cyberspace as a threat that transgresses the values and norms the
United States officially follows and promotes]{.underline}. China is
everything the United States is not. [The Chinese government has an
omnipresent gaze, enabled by excessive use of surveillance techniques
and censorship, which challenges and violates the respect for and
protection of freedom of expression and privacy that the United States
promotes online.]{.underline} The Great Firewall represents to the US
cyber defence community an attempt to secure the power of the Chinese
government and the United States seeks to secure liberal values for all
in cyberspace. [Thus, Chinese government's primary interest in
consolidating its own centralised power by draining the economic power
of others through cyber theft of intellectual property undermines the
United States' official ambition of becoming the global force for
good]{.underline} that brings economic prosperity to billions all over
the world. Lastly, the opaque Chinese government/patriotic hacker
relationship is a transgression of the idea of a transparent and
lawabiding state that the United States publicly promotes and defends.¶
Let me now turn to the second step in the symptomal reading; namely
highlighting what tensions in the US cyber defence the Chinese fantasy
displaces, how the Chinese threat object is taking on different opposing
features, and where the 'repressed' returns.¶ [First, 'China in
cyberspace' displaces the fact that there are more uncomfortable and
disavowed 'truths' about the cyberspace politics in the United States,
'truths' that are pushed to the margins of the US cyber defence
discourse]{.underline}. Prior to the Snowden revelations, this was, for
example, the fact that American privacy online is under pressure, not
only from Facebook but also from the intelligence agencies' attempt to
prevent terrorism[. Similarly, one can detect a process of displacement
in relation to the fact that the United States' pursuit of military
superiority in cyberspace involves exploiting vulnerabilities in IT
systems used by Americans as well as allies, which ultimately reproduces
an environment that is technically insecure. Pushed to the margins by
the Chinese fantasy is also the fact that the US cyber defence community
itself is riddled with tensions,]{.underline} for example, over funding
or who should have authority over the US cyber capabilities -- that is,
whether to use software exploits (cyber weapons) for intelligence (NSA)
or military (US Cyber Command) purposes. Thus, 'China in cyberspace' is
a symptom of more fundamental tensions. It plays a role as the object
that prevents the US cyber defence community from confronting the fact
that it is neither defending cyberspace nor is a homogenous whole. [In
other words, China is not only our other, it is that which enable us to
keep the illusion that we are a 'whole' American self, and that which
allows us to identify with this self. It prevents the US cyber defence
community from confronting the fact that the very social field it
represents is structured around an impossibility -- that fulfilling a
fantasy does not deliver the enjoyment it promises.]{.underline} ¶
Second, the displacement is supported by a condensation: the Chinese
cyber threat takes on contradictory features. While more 'traditional'
discourse analyses would see such inconsistencies as evidence of a less
stable discourse,73 the symptomal reading draws the opposite conclusion.
[It was noted above, how the Chinese government through its Great
Firewall is perceived to exert total control over its citizens and how
the government enjoys total homogenisation with these subjects. Yet, it
is also commonly understood among members of the US cyber defence
community that the technical restrictions deployed by Chinese government
authorities are easily circumvented by Chinese netizens and that the
general level of cybersecurity in China is low]{.underline}. This is
illustrated, for example, by a US Cyber Command official who explained
in an interview that the NSA with ease had penetrated networks in
Chinese universities, mobile phones, fibre-optic cables and servers
controlled by the Chinese government, and second, by an official US
policy that invests millions of dollars in technologies to promote
freedom online, including tools for citizens to circumvent censorship
regimes.74¶ [According to the logic of condensation, the perception of
the weaknesses of Chinese cybersecurity exacerbates, rather than dampens
the perception of China as a threat.]{.underline} In an interview, a US
official working with cyber defence policy worried that the insufficient
Chinese cybersecurity allows other groups to route their cyberattacks
through Chinese networks, while permitting China to deny responsibility
for any hostile cyber activity with reference to a possible third party
having penetrated its IT infrastructure. [In other words, China is both
a cyber superpower and cybersecurity novice -- and threatening for both
reasons]{.underline}. However, what hold these conflicting narratives
together is what they have in common. [In both cases, the Chinese
government enjoys what the US cyber defence community cannot have:
plausible deniability due to poor cybersecurity and totalitarian control
with its citizens]{.underline}. This is the role of condensation.¶
Importantly, while China is a symptom that displaces other more
fundamental 'truths', these 'truths' return. [Thus, the Snowden
revelations symbolise 'a return of the repressed'. Snowden and other
whistleblowers revealed how the US cyber defence community is not simply
defending a unified United States from Chinese threats from cyberspace
but is conducting excessive surveillance and cyber exploitation
practices]{.underline}; as will be elaborated in the following, the US
cyber defence entities undermine global network security, collect data
on its own citizens, and bribe private companies to share more user data
than necessary -- and they lie to Congress about it. [As I will argue,
these transgressive practices should not be understood as being detached
from the official US cyber defence discourse characterised by restraint,
transparency and clarity, but as constitutive hereof. Transgression is
closely connected to the fantasmatic distinction between an idealised
harmonious self and the Chinese symptom]{.underline}. The last section
elaborates this claim by extracting the kernel of enjoyment that work to
sustain the US cyber defence discourse.

### Deterrence

#### Deterrence rests on the constant preparation for war- this exacerbates structural violence and leads to threat inflation

**Christie et al in 2001**

Christie, D. J., Wagner, R. V., & Winter, D. A. (Eds.). (2001). Peace,
Conflict, and Violence: Peace Psychology for the 21st Century. Englewood
Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall.

Like Woodrow Wilson, [we define militarism]{.underline} in this chapter
[as a psychological rather than a¶ physical process: Militarism is a set
of values that support military activities and enable countries¶ to
mobilize for war. Militarism is as important during peace as it is
during war]{.underline}. In fact, **[wars cannot be conducted unless
militarism is nurtured long before wars begin]{.underline}**. In
democracies, [somebody must provide a rationale for]{.underline}
military expenditures and possible [threats]{.underline}. [The
importance of]{.underline}¶ military [readiness must be
articulated]{.underline} and that rationale must be persuasively
communicated to¶ the public. Legislative decision-makers must agree to
allocate funds for the military, rather than¶ to other forms of social
spending.¶ In this chapter, we argue that [the preparation for war is as
problematic as war itself. Because ¶ militarism is a global form of
structural violence, we begin by analyzing the]{.underline} excessive
financial¶ costs and [social injustice caused by
militarism]{.underline}. Our central concern is why people decide to
pay¶ these exorbitant prices. To answer this question, we examine
underlying psychological processes¶ that are not always obvious. We
assert that [money, masculinism, and the search for the mystical¶ drive
militaristic sentiments beyond logical ends]{.underline}. Finally, we
suggest that psychologically valid¶ mechanisms to address these motives
are required before structural violence from excessive militarism can be
curbed. Because militarism calls on some of the deepest and most
cherished of all¶ human capacities, we believe that salvaging the best
of militarism while redirecting the military's¶ focus is a crucial task
for the twenty-first century.¶ THE THIN LINE BETWEEN WAR AND PEACE¶ In
modern societies, support for military matters is often covert until
armed conflict erupts.¶ When soldiers fight wars, they must leave their
families and join scores of other displaced persons to march, kill, and
die for the sake of some political objective they often know little
about.¶ Because, as we have long known, [war is not instinctual, people
must be socialized to kill]{.underline} (May,¶ 1943). [The media helps
the public understand the need to fight by objectifying the
enemy]{.underline} and¶ portraying it as evil (Hesse & Mack, 1991), and
often even subhuman (Reiber & Kelly, 1991).¶ **[Such treatment
communicates dire predictions of what might happen should the enemy
prevail]{.underline}**.¶ For example, in the early stages of the Vietnam
War, the public was continually warned that a¶ communist government in
Vietnam would only be the first of a line of falling dominoes that¶
would eventually threaten the United States. Strong feelings of
nationalistic identification get¶ aroused, creating an "us vs. them"
dichotomy that is oversimplified and rigid (Tetlock, 1988).¶ Military
leaders on our side are depicted as heroes, and [people questioning the
wisdom of mili-¶ tary action are portrayed as unpatriotic]{.underline}.¶
**[Yet sudden psychological support of military actions cannot arise in
a vacuum.]{.underline}** Along with a¶ well-rehearsed army, government
**[leaders and the media build militaristic value systems between¶ wars
so that militariesrealism can be instantly activated]{.underline}**. In
peacetime, such values are often latent.¶ [Large numbers of citizens
passively condone, if not support, their militaries, in order for them
to¶ function effectively when called upon. In this way, the line between
peace and war becomes¶ blurred]{.underline}. The first peace
psychologist, William James, noted that "battles are only a public
verification of the mastery gained during the peace interval...\[The\]
preparation for war by nations is¶ the real war, permanent, unceasing"
(James, 1910/1995, p. 19).¶ STRUCTURAL VIOLENCE OF MILITARY
PREPAREDNESS¶ **[Preparation for war is a form of structural violence,
since its social, political, and economic¶ structures cause avoidable
injury or deaths]{.underline}** (Christie, 1997; Galtung, 1969).
[Structural violence is¶ insidious because it has no active
agent]{.underline}, no conscious intent, **[and no clear point of
origin]{.underline}** (see¶ Chapter 1). But inevitably, national
decision-makers choose between military and social spending. When
countries spend precious income on military matters instead of food,
health care, or¶ environmental protection and restoration, injuries and
deaths to civilians occur. As Eisenhower¶ put it a half century ago,
"the problem in defense spending is to figure how far you should go¶
without destroying from within what you are trying to defend from
without" (1956, as quoted by¶ Sivard, 1996).¶ Half of the world's
governments spend more to guard their citizens against military attack¶
than to protect them against the enemies of good health, such as
contaminated water, poor nutri-¶ tion, and lack of medical care (Sivard,
1993). World military expenditures reached an all-time¶ high of \$1.3
trillion in 1987. Despite significant decreases since the close of the
Cold War, however, global expenditures in 1995 still amounted to more
than \$1.4 million per minute. The¶ United States became the world's
military superpower during World War II, when its military¶ budget
sky-rocketed from under \$13 billion a year to \$530 billion (Sivard,
1996). [The United¶ States currently eclipses the rest of the world by a
huge margin, spending]{.underline} over five times that of¶ the
second-biggest spender (Russia); [more than the combined budgets of the
13 countries ranking below it]{.underline} (Sivard, 1996); **[and over
18 times the combined spending of those countries often¶ identified as
its biggest threats]{.underline}** (North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya,
Syria, Sudan, and Cuba).¶ Even redirecting relatively small amounts of
military expenditures could significantly impact¶ social well-being (see
Mazaruna and McKay, this volume; Pilisuk, this volume). For example,¶
just 4 percent of the world's military budget could raise global
literacy to 50 percent, and redirecting 8 percent of military budgets
for family planning would stabilize global population by the¶ year 2015.
The cost of one nuclear-powered submarine (\$2.5 billion) could immunize
the world's¶ children for one year. Clearly, excessive military
expenditures constitute great structural violence.

#### Their deterrence and domestic industry arguments are a link- it is the belief in the necessary preparation for war that drives militarist ideology

Carl **Mirra in 2008**

Ph.D. Adelphi University; Countering Militarism through Peace Education;
https://www.tc.columbia.edu/epe/epe-entries/Mirra_ch11_22feb08.pdf

Of special importance to peace educators is Bacevich's (2005)
observation that militarism¶ involves the use of force at the expense of
alternative solutions. Following sociologist C. Wright¶ Mills'
description of the "military metaphysic," Bacevich notes that
[militarism involves the¶ "tendency to see international problems as
military problems]{.underline} and to discount the likelihood of¶
finding a solution except through military means" (2005, p. 2).
[Bacevich locates the rise of¶ militarism in U.S. society at the turn of
the twenty-first century, owing principally to the country's¶
inclination to equate national greatness with military
prowess]{.underline}. The second Bush administration's¶ doctrines of
unilateral and preemptive war also accelerate militarism by prioritizing
the use of¶ force. ¶ **[Militarism need not find expression in warfare
alone]{.underline}**. **[War preparedness contributes mightily to¶
militaristic sensibilities]{.underline}**. [A thriving war industry adds
to a militarized world]{.underline}. It is estimated that the¶ major
powers alone possess some 30,000 nuclear weapons and [global arms
spending was¶ roughly U.S. \$55.8 billion annually at the turn of the
twenty-first century]{.underline} (Menon, 2001). Peace¶ researchers have
demonstrated that **[massive arms spending while human needs are unmet¶
constitute structural violence]{.underline}**, since expenditures on
arms come at the expense of human needs.¶ [Militarism thrives on
insecurity, anxiety and fear, thereby allowing resources to be diverted
from¶]{.underline} education, [health]{.underline} care and related
[needs]{.underline}. The World Council of Churches has argued that¶
humanity might have avoided the disaster of nuclear war, but not the
disaster of malnutrition,¶ educational neglect and lack of health care
(Reardon, 1982). **[These problems are exacerbated by¶ military spending
that diverts badly-needed resources to excessive military
preparedness]{.underline}**. [This¶ phenomenon is related to the
"military-industrial complex,]{.underline}" a term coined by U.S.
President¶ Dwight Eisenhower in 1961. The president warned that the
confluence of the private defense¶ industry with the government led to
the "mindless pursuit" of "redundant weapons systems"¶ (Roland, 2001, p.
5). Mills' (1956) formulation of a "power elite" that adopted a military
mindset¶ expands Eisenhower's concept to include how [economic
priorities propel militaristic attitudes.]{.underline}

### Diplomacy

#### The aff's use of diplomacy to uphold US interests represents a classist hegemonic project- policy makers have a vested economic interest in maintaining the social and political order

**De Graaff and van Apeldoorn in 2011**

Naná de Graaff VU University - Amsterdam, The Netherlands Bastiaan van
Apeldoorn VU University - Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Varieties of US
Post-Cold War Imperialism: Anatomy of a Failed Hegemonic Project and the
Future of US Geopolitics, Critical Sociology 37(4) 403--427

We argue that in understanding the variations in US imperialism we also
need to examine those 'specific conjunctures' in which one hegemonic
project may take the place of another without necessarily being linked
to a concomitant change in accumulation strategy. However, we stress
with Jessop that [in order to be successful hegemonic projects need to
advance the interests of a dominant class fraction]{.underline}, and
thus to be articulated to a successful accumulation strategy -- whether
old or new. Success is not guaranteed, but [seeking to advance these
interests is what a hegemonic project is about. Let us now turn to the
important 'geopolitical' dimension of any hegemonic project as
formulated within]{.underline} the national context of [a]{.underline}
leading [capitalist state such as the US]{.underline}A. [As states are
key in providing the preconditions for]{.underline} capitalist [markets
to develop]{.underline} and for capitalist accumulation to take place
(Van Apeldoorn and Horn, 2007), **[any national or transnational
capitalist class is dependent upon the application of state power both
nationally and internationally]{.underline}** (see e.g. Wood, 2003).
[Hegemonic projects, as expressive of underlying class interests, will
therefore have to articulate]{.underline} not just [a
vision]{.underline} with regard to how to establish control over
subordinate social groups in a domestic context (i.e. a national-popular
programme), but also [with respect to world order and the position of
the respective state or states within it.]{.underline} It is thus that,
as Van der Pijl (2007) maintains, **[class forms the crucial nexus
between global capitalism and geopolitics: rather than viewing them as
autonomous, they must be seen as internally related]{.underline}**. This
is not to imply that geopolitical strategy is in any way determined by
objective class interests. On the contrary, [these interests must be
articulated politically and ideologically]{.underline}, and their
possible translation into state policy must be seen as a contingent
outcome of social and political struggles. Our claim is, however, that
**[the content of these political and discursive practices is shaped by
the social position of the actors engaging in it and by underlying
social relations]{.underline}**.4 It is thus that we must analyse how
actors formulating geopolitical strategies are, to use Gramsci's (1971)
terminology, organically linked to certain social forces and to class
interests. [It is such 'organic intellectuals']{.underline}, [located
both within and beyond the state apparatus, that must be seen as
constructing a hegemonic project]{.underline} -- formulating and
disseminating a particular strategy -- **[as an articulation of
long-term class interests]{.underline}**. It is thus that we seek to
show how [geopolitical strategy is not so much]{.underline}, as Harvey
would have it, [formulated by a class of state managers]{.underline}
with separate interests and motivations (2003: 27), **[but by
intellectuals, policy advisors and]{.underline}** (in the end by)
**[state officials who are in fact closely linked to private capitalist
interests]{.underline}**. Although the capitalist class of the most
powerful state may be highly integrated into certain patterns of
transnational class formation, it is plausible that it has, at the same
time, a clear sense of a distinct national interest. [Precisely because
of the fact that it sits at the top of the international and global
hierarchy, it is acutely aware of the interest it has in maintaining the
current system and of **what it has to lose if the system breaks
down**]{.underline}. [We therefore hypothesize that hegemonic projects
formulated within the context of such a dominant state will tend to
express a strong geopolitical consciousness]{.underline}, **[and include
a rather elaborate strategy with respect to how to exercise control over
other states and their societies]{.underline}**. It is from this
perspective that we will below analyse the rise and fall of the
neoconservative project in terms of a hegemonic project that has been
formulated and propagated within the national political arena of the USA
and has subsequently been very successful in shaping US foreign policy
after 9/11.5 We explain the rise of this project by situating its
origins within the contradictions and limits of what we see as the
hegemonic project of neoliberal globalization that unfolded in the
1990s, while arguing that the effect of these structural dynamics were
crucially mediated by the concrete agency of a political vanguard tied
to dominant social forces within the USA. [The neoconservative
project,]{.underline} we argue[, offered an answer to a crucial question
facing the US ruling class: how to prolong US global hegemony at a
moment when the 'answer' of the neoliberal project no longer seemed that
compelling any more.]{.underline}

#### Diplomacy is a tool to infuse foreign policy with distinct class interest- exceptionalism, leverage, and the maintenance of capitalism 

ANDREI A. **GROMYKO in 1983**

Minister of Foreign Affairs (1957--1985) and as Chairman of the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (1985--1988). Gromyko was responsible
for many top decisions on Soviet foreign policy until he retired in
1988, Modern Diplomacy of Capitalist Powers, vii-viii

This book deals with the current problems of bourgeois diplomacy. [Every
state defines the objectives and tasks of its diplomacy, which is the
sum total of all the measures]{.underline}, as well as the forms, ways,
and means [used by this state to implement its general policy in
international affairs]{.underline}. Priority is attached to foreign
policy; however, [foreign policy and diplomacy are inseparably
linked]{.underline} and interlocked in an integral whole. It follows
from this fact that **[the foreign policy and diplomacy of a state,
which has a definite social system, stem from the very nature of this
system, or the ideology of the class or classes in power, and are called
upon to secure their interests]{.underline}**. In short,
[diplomacy]{.underline}, just like foreign policy, [has a distinctive
class character]{.underline}. **[Seeking to shape the destinies of
nations, the exploiter classes have always regarded the planning and
implementation of foreign policy and diplomatic activity as their
exclusive privilege]{.underline}**. [Today]{.underline}, as in the past,
[they take whatever steps are necessary to bar the common people from
participation in this process]{.underline} in whatever form, let alone
directly, through their representatives. **[Bourgeois diplomacy
continues its loyal service to the capitalist system]{.underline}**, and
to the monopoly bourgeoisie, [which views diplomacy as an important
instrument for preserving and consolidating its positions on the
international scene]{.underline}, for the struggle against world
socialism, the revolutionary and national liberation movements. In
fulfilling its purpose bourgeois diplomacy makes wide use of the
experience and facilities available in the rich arsenal of customs and
traditions, norms and methods that took shape and accumulated through
centuries of international intercourse, and activity in the foreign
policy field. As Lenin pointed out in his time, [in]{.underline} all
areas of politics, [foreign policy]{.underline} in particular, [the
proletariat which has come to power must know the methods of its
opponent and use them at least with equal skill]{.underline}.1 Needless
to say, [deception, blackmail, and dictation,]{.underline} which [have
become the stock-in-trade of bourgeois diplomacy]{.underline}, are
inapplicable in the practices of socialist diplomacy for reasons of
principle and morality. Knowledge and consideration of these methods as
diplomatic weapons of the bourgeoisie are quite indispensable for a
timely exposure and analysis of imperialist plans and for frustrating
them effectively. [Falsehood and deception inherent in the diplomacy of
capitalist powers are strikingly manifest in the glaring discrepancy
between the foreign-policy principles and objectives they announce
officially and those, they actually pursue in real life]{.underline}.
[The ruling sections of these countries proclaiming noble foreign-policy
principles and objectives often use them as a cover-up to substitute
their own selfish interests for the general state and national
interests]{.underline}, to camouflage their true intentions and actions
in international affairs, concealing thereby the essence of their
diplomacy alien to their peoples.

#### The aff's diplomatic engagement is an attempt to shore up US power through consent- it still relies on imperial power to achieve compliance

**De Graaff and van Apeldoorn in 2011**

Post-Cold War Imperialism: Anatomy of a Failed Hegemonic Project and the
Future of US Geopolitics, Critical Sociology 37(4) 403--427

[It is true of course that Obama also at the same time]{.underline}, and
in contrast to his predecessor, [emphasizes the important role of
international institutions]{.underline} and regimes (lauding in
particular the United Nations) [and since taking office has stepped
up]{.underline}, next to the deliberate public relations efforts to
restore America's image abroad, the kind of [diplomatic
engagement]{.underline} -- including with so-called rogue states -- that
was already going on in a more muted way at the end of the Bush reign.
Although this engagement in the meantime has turned out to be less
effective than hoped for and is being criticized from both the left and
the right, and for instance vis-a-vis Iran a more hard-line stance seems
now again in the offing, not just in style and tone but also in terms of
actual foreign policy-making during Obama's first year 'the multilateral
gloves' (Stokes, 2005) have to some extent been put back on. [This seems
to fit well with a 'liberal internationalist' outlook]{.underline} such
as was also expressed by previous democratic administrations (see e.g.
Chanley, 1999). **[Yet this should not be taken as simply a return to
previous policies]{.underline}**. [First, the renewed emphasis on
institutions and diplomacy is combined with a continued emphasis on the
need to enhance and apply military power]{.underline}, and more so than
during the last Democratic presidency. A clear testimony of this is
Obama's Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in which he stated that 'it
was not just simply international institutions ... that brought
stability to a post-World War II world ... The United States of America
has helped to underwrite global security for more than six decades with
the blood of our citizens and the strengths of our arms' (Obama, 2009b).
In the same speech, praised by the leading neoconservative Robert Kagan
(2009) as signalling a 'significant shift' towards 'a tougher, less
forgiving, more quintessentially American approach', [Obama moreover
reiterated that 'I]{.underline} -- like any head of state -- [reserve
the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend my
nation]{.underline}.' (Obama, 2009b) [Second, inasmuch as Obama does
represent a relative shift back from coercion to consent, this should be
seen in light of the failures of the coercive strategies of]{.underline}
neoconservative [imperialism]{.underline}. [As the latter has undermined
consent for US power]{.underline} so much as to become rather
counter-productive, **[playing the 'goodwill' card may not only come
naturally to Obama, but could also be seen as a strategy to seek to
restore what is left of US global hegemony]{.underline}**. [The renewed
search for consent]{.underline} that we have observed in Obama's first
year, however, is one that [is born out of the fact that the USA has
only a few cards left]{.underline}. This is crucially different from the
neoliberal project of the Clinton years, which were the heyday for the
power of both the USA and the neoliberal ideology. In short, [inasmuch
as multilateralism is making something of a comeback, it is out of
weakness rather than strength]{.underline}. Finally, as indicated, the
biggest challenge for Obama arguably lies on the economic front, where
Obama not only has to adapt to the new multipolar reality and the loss
of US structural power, but also will have to cope with the economic and
ideological failure of the neoliberal accumulation strategy that has
been pursued over the past decades; a failure which can be seen as at
the heart of the current economic crisis. Returning to our network
analysis above, [the fact that largely the same people]{.underline},
[linked to the same capital interests, which promoted the neoliberal
accumulation strategy in the 1990s in the first place]{.underline} (e.g.
Larry Summers, Paul Volcker) [are now in charge of solving the crisis,
in this respect may not bode well]{.underline}. Although Obama has
recognized, and indeed made into a key priority of his overall foreign
policy, the need to tackle the financial crisis also at a global level,
in particular through the G-20 as the new primary platform for global
economic governance, the three summits held thus far have produced
little in the way of concrete steps towards a global reregulation of
finance that could really form the basis for an alternative global
growth model.

### Heg

#### Hegemony is upheld through a militaristic ideology -- restricts opposition by entrenching itself as key to the economy and national security 

**Bernazolli and Flint '09** (Richelle M. -- University of Illinois at
Urbana-Campaign; Colin- University of Illinois at Urbana-Campaign;
"Power, Place, and Militarism: Toward a Comparative Geographic Analysis
of Militarization")

The Gramscian notion of hegemony, which sought to explain societal
acquiescence to a capitalist system that created and maintained vast
economic inequalities, held that the poor and working-class sectors of
society adopt the dominant cultural group's 'values, norms, perceptions,
beliefs, sentiments, and prejudices' (Lears 1985, 569).
[Consider]{.underline} for a moment [the role of the military in
society]{.underline}, [with its own particular values, norms,
perceptions, beliefs, and practices]{.underline}. [In order to gain and
maintain support]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} at least
[acquiescence]{.underline}, [for a large, standing armed force and the
different activities it takes on,]{.underline} with associated
opportunity costs, those [who]{.underline} do not necessarily have a
stake in the well-being of this system [must be somehow convinced that
its health and viability is of critical importance to their own
well-being]{.underline}. [Society as a whole must be acculturated to
adopt a particular worldview]{.underline} and set of cultural beliefs
[that will generate]{.underline} a certain level of [acquiescence to
whatever it is the military is doing]{.underline} at any time and in any
place. In adopting a Gramscian view of hegemony, we do not wish to imply
that there is necessarily a ruling military class analogous to the
ruling economic class of which Gramsci spoke. Rather, [we posit that
hegemony]{.underline} -- the ability to set agendas and define values
and norms -- [has advanced militaristic goals as well as economic or
class goals]{.underline}. Indeed, the various sets of goals are
intertwined and often compliment each other. The point here is that
[Gramsci's broad notion of power is of use in analyses that go beyond
class in a capitalist society]{.underline}. For example, Flint (2006)
notes that the Gramscian notion of power demonstrates how '[geopolitical
practices and ideas are disseminated and portrayed to wide audiences in
order to justify them and make them appear "normal]{.underline}" while
belittling alternative views' (Flint 2006, 28). Cresswell (1996), in his
theorizations of placediscussed above, employs Gramsci's ideas in order
to explain the role of place in constructing dominant ideologies. And
Taylor (1999) adapts the Gramscian idea of hegemony from the scale of a
particular society to the globe in order to explore the mechanisms by
which the last three world hegemons (the Netherlands, Great Britain, and
the United States) have each been able to construct and impose their own
versions of 'modernity' on the rest of the world. Emphasizing that
dominant worldviews do not take hold in a simple, top-down manner, Sharp
(2000, 31) points out that [**hegemony**, far from being constructed
solely through political ideologies on the part of the elites of
society, **is produced and maintained** 'more immediately **through
detailed scripting of** some of the most ordinary and mundane **aspects
of everyday life**.]{.underline}' [It is this very banality that makes
militarism more than merely an elite ideology]{.underline}, or a set of
beliefs with which state institutions indoctrinate the less powerful
sectors of society. This does not rule out the possibility of resistance
to the dominant ideology. Just as Gramsci had to explain open revolts
such as workers' strikes and factory takeovers, [the application of
cultural hegemony to militarism necessitates an explanation of
activities such as war protests]{.underline}. [In actuality, maintaining
hegemony does not require constant commitment from subordinates to the
existing system; rather, **the dominant group** carefully **defines the
acceptable range of resistance** to these processes]{.underline}. As
Lears (1985, 569) points out, most of the time, the vast majority of
people find it difficult, perhaps impossible, 'to translate the outlook
implicit in their experience into a conception of the world that will
directly challenge the hegemonic culture.' [This explains why we may see
protests to a particular event]{.underline}, such as the Iraq War, [but
not challenges to the overall role of the military in
society]{.underline} (although it is the very nature of the military's
role in society that allows such wars to happen). Gramsci's theories of
common-sense power and cultural hegemony rest on his distinction between
political society and civil society, a view echoed by Agnew (1987) and
Kirby (1993) in their theorization of place. Political society consists
of the juridical or coercive institutions, most notably the police and
the military. [Providing the necessary 'direct domination' or command,
political society assures the discipline of those members of society who
do not consent to the imposed order willingly]{.underline}. Civil
society, on the other hand, consists of institutions such as schools,
the media, churches, trade unions, and political parties. In contrast to
political society[, civil society corresponds with the actual function
of 'hegemony'; the diffusion of cultural values and norms that construct
the 'spontaneous' consent given by the masses to the general direction
imposed on social life by the dominant group]{.underline} (Bellamy and
Schecter 1993, 118--119). [The cultural hegemony of militarism, as with
class-based hegemony, can be understood as the convergence of political
and civil society in 'perpetuating the existing order]{.underline}'
(Boggs 1976, 17). **[One way in which the military sector achieves
ascendancy within the state is to become an essential component of the
economy]{.underline}**. [Compared to the cultural or ideological side of
militarization, the economic mechanisms of militarization are more
tangible]{.underline} and readily quantified. Therefore, although
defense spending is often shrouded in secrecy, researchers have been
able to utilize secondary data in order to focus empirically on these
economic processes, making them well documented in geography. For
instance, Markusen et al. (1991, 5) provide 'a preliminary sketch of a
theory of location for the defense industries,' which the authors note
have altered the US economy in fundamental ways, contributing to the
rapid development of certain regions and cities vis-à-vis others
throughout the Cold War. The edited volume the Pentagon and the Cities
(Kirby 1992) was compiled with an eye toward the end of the Cold War and
what this geopolitical transition might mean for the many communities
across the United States that had come to rely on defense spending for
their economic survival. In addition, at this time, Crump (1993) looked
at how [the spatial distribution of Department of Defense services
procurement lead to new patterns of regional development and economic
inequalities]{.underline} (see Woodward 2004 for a comprehensive review
of military economic geography).

#### Reframing US policies as necessary and defensive perpetuates hegemony by presupposing the necessity of militarism for a secure world 

**Cypher '16** (James M. - Research Scholar at the Global Institute for
Sustainable Prosperity and a Research Professor in the Doctoral Program
in Development Studies (UAED), "Hegemony, military power projection and
US structural economic interests in the periphery," Third World
Quarterly)

[Neoliberalism is a complex, quickly metamorphosing doctrine with many
objectives, including especially a largely successful campaign to
de-politicise the vast 'underlying population']{.underline}.34 [As a
consequence]{.underline} of this effort, [it has only been in the
context of the run-up to intervention in Iraq]{.underline} in 2003 [that
the **intellectual hegemony of US militarism has been
questioned**]{.underline} within the country since the last aftershocks
of the Vietnam war era. Notably useful in this short moment of
re-politicisation have been the contributions of Blum, which offered a
popular summary of US interventions, and Kolko, who presented a
sophisticated critique of the pretentions of US power projection.35
Nevertheless, as [the 'perpetual war' era]{.underline} of the 21st
century [was]{.underline} consolidated in Afghanistan and Iraq, such
disavowals were gradually [subordinated through a new crystallisation of
US '**conventional wisdom'**]{.underline}, [which **ceased to view
ongoing military campaigns as** events **beyond the
'ordinary**]{.underline}**'**. [This unnoticed transmogrification was
achieved through the **constant 'reframing'** **of the geopolitical
policies** of the US as merely 'necessary, protective, defensive'
measures]{.underline} [as the 'Pentagon propaganda machine' worked
assiduously with the mass media to de-legitimate opposition]{.underline}
to these interventions and promote a numbing, universal 'patriotic'
discourse.36 Second, [Falk emphasised the attention the power elite has
given to the avoidance of US war casualties]{.underline}, using
technologies that effectively shift the fatalities of war-fighting onto
(largely) foreign non-combatants. After Vietnam great care was given to
the maintenance of consent through popular disengagement from the
realities of intervention. Then President Carter began the
reconstruction of US military intervention capabilities with the Rapid
Deployment Force. Such new capabilities allowed for lightning US
intervention in Panama in 1989. In 2003 'Shock and Awe' -- achieved
through the rapid advance of overwhelming force -- were thought to be
the military tactics that would bring Iraq under US dominance before the
American populace had an opportunity to react to events. In this
instance, as Falk emphasised, Iraqi national resistance quickly formed
and a prolonged battle ensued. 'Fast intervention', conducted with an
array of high-tech weaponry, is designed to assure relatively few US
military personnel killed in action. Thus, [there is a constant
substitution of capital for manpower in the field of battle]{.underline}
for many reasons, [one being that US corpses quickly pierce the
carefully constructed **fog of intellectual hegemony** deployed **to
ensure** US citizen **consent in the application of military force** in
distant Southern nations. Interventions, then, have been facilitated
through new processes and procedures carefully constructed to create a
sufficient degree of autonomy **to permit the US state to 'project
power'** and intervene without broad societal resistanc]{.underline}e.
Nonetheless, [prolonged engagements resulting from creative forms of
asymmetric national resistance]{.underline} regularly erode and [degrade
US social consent]{.underline}, requiring its constant reconstruction.
This erosion of consent can be forestalled to a considerable degree
thanks to a culturally well-entrenched allegiance to US militarism.
[Militarism entails both individual and societal deference to all things
military -- including the military definition of reality,]{.underline}
as Mills argued: '[military power has become an ascendant end in
itself...heightening the prestige and increasing the power of the
military...tends to become a basis of national policy']{.underline}.37
However, US militarism has always, ultimately, been a civilian-dominated
construct, although since 1945 the civil--military relationship has
frequently been 'fractious, combative and problematic'.38 **[Militarism
is the societal belief that the use of force in international
relations]{.underline}** -- as a preferred option -- **[can achieve
national objectives]{.underline}.** Furthermore, [it is the **dominance
of military affairs in the construction of** national priorities and
**policies**]{.underline}. Militarism, in the US guise, does not mean
that high-ranking military cadres precipitate episodes of 'power
projection'. Rather, most frequently, this role is filled by civilians
-- often in the face of opposition or scepticism from the Joint Chiefs
of Staff. [Militarists believe in the 'logic of violence']{.underline},
although there is no logic to violence except its assurance of
'blowback'. Militarism has its deepest roots in the south states of
America, where 'valour' and unquestioning 'patriotism' have long been
held up as the highest of societal values. Today US military bases are
spread throughout the southern states, reflecting the abiding influence
of generations of jingoistic Senators and Congressional Representatives.
US militarism is embraced by an influential portion of the civilian
population, regardless of geography, particularly through the
institutional power of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW, with 1.4
million members), the American Legion (2.4 million veteran members) and
retired officer associations. Of equal importance, with the end of
national military service (in 1973), a multi-generational 'caste' of
military families formed, with the south states constituting its
strongest representation.39 Thus, the [ideological hegemony needed to
enable near-constant military interventions]{.underline} since the end
of the Cold War [is not structurally fragile]{.underline}. Neither is it
unassailable[. Regardless of the calamitous conditions arising from US
interventions -- including massive civilian casualties and displacement
-- a vociferous portion of the populace embodies unmitigated support for
US military 'power projection']{.underline}. [Another
portion]{.underline} of the population -- always risking the accusation
of treasonous practices -- [embraces a counter-hegemonic
position]{.underline} either as pacifists and/or [because of their
critique of the structural political economy of US military
interventions]{.underline}. At any moment in time a vast proportion of
the apolitical US populace has no strong commitment to either the
permanent militarist faction or to those who hold an a priori position
of opposition. Under conditions of prolonged military engagement this
structurally uncommitted and easily deceived portion of the populace
slowly and quietly withdraws its consent for interminable exercises in
power projection. This is normally characterised as 'war fatigue' the
'Vietnam Syndrome' or some other sweeping term adopted by mass media
entities that interpret, and communicate, the results of (frequently
manipulated) public opinions polls. Manufactured consent, then, can be
challenged at crucial conjunctures. Nonetheless[, deeper
structural]{.underline} and inertial [forces tend]{.underline} -- time
and again -- **[to reassert the intellectually hegemonic construct of US
militarism.]{.underline}**

#### Cultural hegemony reentrenches militarism by labeling a war-culture as key to local identities

**Bernazolli and Flint '09** (Richelle M. -- University of Illinois at
Urbana-Campaign; Colin- University of Illinois at Urbana-Campaign;
"Power, Place, and Militarism: Toward a Comparative Geographic Analysis
of Militarization")

Contemporary theories of place provide a framework within which
geographers can bridge society-wide processes, such as state-building,
with local actions, decisions, and experiences. In this view[, places
are widely conceptualized as networks of social relations]{.underline},
rather than simply the local-scale settings, or containers, [in
which]{.underline} social relations occur (Agnew 1996; Massey 1994).
This overview of place literature will look at the [key aspects of
place]{.underline} that we will subsequently [connect to processes of
militarization: place as a recursive and contingent process of social
construction; the role of the production and maintenance of ideology;
and the contestation of dominant ideologies and identities as a
component of the social construction of place.]{.underline} The
recursiveness of place, which is central to contemporary usage of the
concept, stresses that as places are socially constructed, they
concurrently foment particular behaviors and attitudes, which in turn,
reproduce the places. These processes vary between localities, so that
the general phenomena observable at the level of 'mass society' are
experienced uniquely from place to place (Agnew 1987). Thus, the unique
and the general, the structure and the agent, are related in a network
of interdependent localities (Agnew 1987). Historical contingency
likewise 'emphasizes institutional and individual practices as well as
the structured features with which those practices are interwoven' (Pred
1984, 280) and further contributes the notion that places are
constructed over time. While social relations (and the places they
constitute) are dynamic and even sometimes fleeting, new interactions
and behaviors that appear in their place are not built on a 'clean
slate', but instead on the remains of previous ones, inevitably shapedby
what came before (Pred 1984; Massey 1994). Finally, [the construction of
place may often be the result of elite actions in pursuit of particular
goals]{.underline}, as Johnston (1991) posits, but it is important to
recognize that subaltern members of society also play a role -- either
by complying with elite agendas, or by resisting them (Pile and Keith
1997; Thrift 2000). [Place, as a process, is a 'powerful force in the
ongoing hegemonic and counterhegemonic struggles]{.underline},' meaning
that [place reproduces the beliefs that have produced it]{.underline},
and this occurs in such a way that the beliefs eventually appear
self-evident and commonsense (Cresswell 1996, 13; Kirby 1993). [This
idea provides the crucial link between place and ideology.]{.underline}
As noted earlier, while [places]{.underline} may manifest as areas of
resistance to the state, they also [play a crucial role in reproducing
the geography of the state's hegemony]{.underline} (Agnew 1987). [In a
militarized society, this 'geography of hegemony' would
unfold]{.underline} in a number of ways, particularly [in terms of the
cultural manifestations of militarism]{.underline}: [the adoption and
visible signs of military culture and values and ensuing support for
militaristic policies]{.underline}. [Such activities give rise to a
local sense of identity]{.underline}, or sense of place, [which
often]{.underline} -- but not always -- [serve to perpetuate dominant
ideologies and identities]{.underline} (Agnew 1987; Pred 1984; Williams
1977). Places may also be constructed with the aim of resisting elite
identities, ideologies, and objectives (Cresswell 1996; Kirby 1993; Pile
and Keith 1997). In such cases, rather than serving as the local tools
of overarching structures, the social relations and attitudes comprising
localities may formulate in opposition to the policies of the state
(Kirby 1993). Recent empirical work on the practices of memorialization
and commemoration demonstrates how places may consist of competing
forces: those which seek to perpetuate dominant ideologies and
identities and those which seek to contest them (Alderman and Dwyer
2004; Graham and Shirlow 2002; Johnson 2003; Schein 2006[).
Ideologies]{.underline}, both dominant and marginalized, [are inscribed
into the cultural landscape, making this facet of place both a
reflection of the human activities and ideals that have gone into
constructing it, and at the same time, constitutive of them]{.underline}
(Mitchell 2000; Schein 1997). Questions of power, then, are critical to
gaining an understanding of how place based activities produce
particular landscapes (Dowler et al. 2005). [The complexity of
place]{.underline}, with its multiple facets and meanings, [is important
to recognize]{.underline}. However, Agnew's three aspects of place may
be seen as core 'variables' around which a research framework may be
organized. Agnew (1987, 1996) identified l[ocation, which is a place's
role or function in the wider economy]{.underline}; locale, which
[represents the primary institutions organizing social relations and
identity]{.underline} in a place; and sense of place, which refers to
the sense of identity tied to a locality. A fourth dimension,
connectivity, or linkages to other places and other scales, should also
be considered within a place-based research framework (Massey 1994).
Agnew's aspects of place will be revisited later in this article, as we
propose possible comparative research designs for the study of
militarization. As discussed above, several [theories of place have set
the foundation for discussing the construction of places within the
political processes of state formation and maintenance]{.underline}.
[One]{.underline} set of processes involved [is
militarization]{.underline}. But what, exactly, is militarization
accomplishing? [These processes]{.underline}, constituted in large part
by the activities of people in everyday settings, [work to make
militarism a]{.underline} taken-for-granted, or '[natural' facet of many
societies.]{.underline} Hence, [a useful concept for conceptualizing
militarism is that of cultural hegemony]{.underline}, which up to now
has been used in research focusing on class relations within capitalist
societies. Cultural hegemony, as the following section will discuss, is
a term developed by Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci ca. 1930 in
order to explain why the working class had internalized or adopted the
capitalist values of the bourgeoisie -- in effect, reproducing a system
that perpetuated their meager existence. However, this term, in concert
with Gramsci's theories of power, can be readily adapted from an
explanation of the adoption of capitalist values to an explanation of
the adoption of militaristic values.

### Humanitarianism

#### Humanitarianism reifies a monolithic humanity where privileged agencies articulate human insecurity -- ambiguous conceptual boundaries allow for manipulation and violence

**Watson in 2011**

Department of Political Science, University of Victoria, Canada; The
\'human\' as referent object?: Humanitarianism as securitization,
Security Dialogue, Vol. 42(1)

Yet, [security is not the only discourse that may be used to legitimize
the implementation of emergency measures]{.underline}. Turning to recent
historical events, one is struck by the power of
[humanitarianism]{.underline} in [legitimizing a wide range of rather
extraordinary measures]{.underline}. The humanitarian discourse that
shaped the response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami resulted in
unparalleled funding from both public and private sources: over US\$13.5
billion was donated to disaster relief and recovery, and donors included
an unprecedented total of 99 governments (Flint and Goyder, 2006;
Telford and Cosgrave, 2007). Additionally, [elites have used
humanitarianism in varying degrees to justify military interventions in
Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Angola, Mozambique, Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra
Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Zaire, Sudan, Côte
d'Ivoire, Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline} (De Waal and Omaar, 1994;
Wheeler, 2004; Roth, 2004). Perhaps the pinnacle of justification for
military intervention for the purposes of human protection emerged from
the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty's
(2001) report The Responsibility To Protect1 . The ICISS report
explicitly outlines the foundations of the right to military
intervention and garnered relatively widespread international support,
including acceptance by the UN General Assembly (MacFarlane et al.,
2004). The widespread endorsement of this report, combined with [the
continued use of humanitarianism to promote massive relief operations
and military interventions, amply demonstrates that humanitarianism,
like security, is a powerful discourse that legitimizes marshalling a
vast amount of resources in the implementation of emergency
measures]{.underline}. Humanitarianism as a justification for the use of
military force is opposed by critics from all over the political and
academic spectrum: from realists concerned with the use of force for
reasons other than national security (traditionally understood) to
critical theorists concerned with the imperialism of humanitarianism and
its legitimization of violence (Slim, 2001; Ayoob, 2002; Bricmont, 2006;
for overviews, see Welsh, 2004; McFarlane et al., 2004; Macrae, 1998).
Yet, not all critics are completely dismissive of humanitarianism and
the types of intervention it justifies. Those who still advocate for
humanitarian action aim to create a concept of humanitarianism that
either excludes the state and the use of force (ICRC, 2004; Rieff, 2002)
or sets out clear parameters for ensuring that states employ force in a
humane way and toward humanitarian outcomes (Weiss, 2001; Anderson,
1998; De Waal and Omaar, 1994). Consequently, scholars and practitioners
alike have spilled much ink attempting to tie down the meaning of
humanitarianism, in order to prevent its abuse at the hands of state and
non-state actors. Despite these efforts, **[humanitarianism lacks rigid
conceptual boundaries and is extendable, which facilitates ambiguous and
manipulated uses]{.underline}** (Chimni, 2000: 244). [US and British
elites' justification of the invasion of Iraq in terms of
humanitarianism is evidence enough of this problem]{.underline}. Yet,
Chimni's observation is eerily reminiscent of the critiques of the
concept of security -- that security is an essentially contested concept
(Buzan, 1991) and that it is ambiguous and easily manipulated by elites
(Wæver, 1995). Wæver (1995: 54--5) writes that [security's conceptual
fluidity and discursive power encourages power-holders to use the
instrument of security to gain control over an issue and use it for
specific, self-serving purposes. He could just as easily have been
referring to humanitarianism]{.underline}. In this article, I contend
that [the power of humanitarianism to legitimize extraordinary measures
and the problem of its ambiguity and manipulability are best understood
by approaching it as a form of securitization]{.underline}, similar in
kind to societal and state security. [Securitizing
discourses]{.underline} (state, societal, humanitarian, etc.) identify a
referent object that is threatened and [endorse emergency measures to
alleviate the threat.]{.underline} Approaching humanitarianism as a
distinct sector of security with its own logic of threat and
vulnerabilities addresses three critical gaps in securitization theory:
its exclusion of non-state or societal referent objects of security
(Buzan et al., 1998: 36; Hansen and Nissenbaum, 2009: 1160), its
reliance on domestic and democratic forms of governance (Wilkinson,
2007; Vuori, 2008), and its problematic distinction between normal and
emergency measures (Buzan et al., 1998: 25--7; Stritzel, 2007: 367;
Rasmussen, 2001). [Such an approach also contributes to our
understanding of humanitarianism as a structured field in which
**certain actors hold a privileged position in the enunciation of human
insecurity**, in which **a reified and monolithic form of humanity is
declared**, and that supports existing international norms pertaining to
the provision of security for humans.]{.underline}

### Hybrid Warfare/Disinformation

#### Hybrid warfare and disinformation rhetoric serve as empty signifiers to displace any understanding of the structural contradictions generated by militarism

**Ünver and Kurnaz 22**

Computational Text Analysis." SSRN. 4/5/2022. Pg 2-16. LJS

Since then, strategic communicative actions that are intended to
influence, mislead and confuse foreign populations have assumed a
central position in global debates about politics and foreign policy.
Given the impact of such actions on elections, polarization and crisis
management, it was natural for the rhetoric about these actions to
assume such a central position (Bradshaw, Howard, 2018). [However, over
time, popular buzzwords like 'disinformation/misinformation', 'fake
news', and 'information operations' have proliferated in global
political mainstream discourse and assumed an accusatory nature
worldwide as more leaders, diplomats, and politicians have begun using
them to discredit and delegitimize their political opponents. This
dynamic was later conceptualized as 'discursive deflection' (Ross,
Rivers, 2018; Smith, 2019) and became acutely visible in the foreign
policy domain, as more countries have begun securitizing the concepts
'fake news', 'disinformation', and 'information warfare' to similarly
discredit, and delegitimize rival countries]{.underline} (Baum, Potter,
2019). Broadly speaking, 'discursive-deflection' is the strategy of
discrediting competitors and rivals by portraying oneself as the sole
source of truth. While the domestic political use of these terms is
well-studied, we are still somewhat in the dark with regard to why
countries choose to securitize these terms and what happens in their
interactions with other countries when they do so.¶ The foreign policy
use of such terms predates the 2016 US elections and proliferated after
the Russian military involvement in Crimea and Donbas (Khaldarova,
Pantti, 2016). The primary reason for this contextual proliferation was
the Russian decision to deny the initial stages of its involvement in
Ukraine and its broader strategy of distracting and dividing Western
attention over Russian military operations (Mejias, Vokuev, 2017).
[There is still a debate over whether it was really Russian information
operations that had derailed NATO response in Ukraine, or if
disinformation discourses are employed in order to shift the blame over
to Russia at a time when NATO was already divided over its commitment to
Ukraine]{.underline} (Lysenko, Brooks, 2018). While there is robust
evidence of Russian information operations in Ukraine and its role in
spreading disinformation in NATO countries, sustained NATO apathy
towards rising Russian military influence in the Black Sea after 2014
and Syria after 2015 support the latter claim.¶ [Critics of Western
disinformation discourses for example, argue that such discourses have
turned into 'floating (or empty) signifiers', that have no specific or
agreed-upon meaning]{.underline} (Farkas, Schou, 2018). [In that vein,
blaming others for engaging in disinformation often distracts attention
away from a mistake or failed policy enacted by the blamer]{.underline}
(Monsees, 2020). [In this case, critics argue that Western discourses on
disinformation are intended to distract attention away from NATO or EU
divisions, or more domestic level polarization dynamics, by creating a
unique empty signifier (disinformation) that is employed as a rallying
rhetoric that bolsters the significance of external threats]{.underline}
(Mas-Manchón et al., 2021). [This way, disinformation and its associated
terms like misinformation, fake news and information war get
securitized, receiving disproportionate levels of attention in the
policy domain. In this context, disinformation and its associated terms
are used to exaggerate an existing threat and create a rallying
discourse that would channel the attention of the divided Western
nations away from their internal disagreements, and towards an inflated
external threat. Some scholars go even further, arguing that
disinformation is being securitized in the West (especially in NATO) to
the extent the 'war on terror' was securitized through the
2000s]{.underline} (Lanoszka, 2019). In this line, disinformation is
alleged to have become a new strategic glue that would help Western
nations pool in their increasingly diverging interests and resources
into a common cause (Baumann, 2020).¶ Securitization of disinformation
in domestic politics is relatively well-studied (Freelon, Wells, 2020;
Neo, 2021). Although these terms have entered into mainstream debate
after the 2016 US elections, former President Donald Trump too, had
securitized fake news to delegitimize his opponents by constructing
rival disinformation as a national security problem, indirectly
attributable to China (Polletta, Callahan, 2019). [Following the tornado
of accusations in the US, political actors in Britain, France, Italy,
South Africa, Kenya and others have begun blaming each other for
engaging in organized disinformation]{.underline} (Maweu, 2019;
Saurwein, Spencer-Smith, 2020). [Even in Sweden, there is empirical
evidence that suggests accusing journalists of spreading fake news
results in self-censorship of such outlets]{.underline} (Bennett,
Livingston, 2018). [There are further cases of evidence supporting the
claim that elite-level discourses on disinformation have a direct effect
on how the wider society perceives information and facts in general,
creating a measurable effect on public trust towards such facts and
information]{.underline} (Van Duyn, Collier, 2019). In Singapore for
example, delegitimizing rival parties and news outlets through
disinformation discourse is considered 'acceptable', as part of the
state's duty to discipline the opposition and its political actors (Tan,
2020). [Similar trends emerging in democracies and authoritarian
countries alike, such as in Austria, Australia, Poland, Russia, and
South Africa, demonstrate the universality of instrumentalizing
disinformation discourse as a political delegitimization
tactic]{.underline} (Kurowska, Reshetnikov, 2018; Tandoc et al., 2018).¶
While a robust scholarship is emerging on the domestic political uses of
disinformation discourse, there has so far been no longitudinal, large-N
study that explored how such constructions emerge in international
politics. Furthermore, there has so far been no exploration of how such
discourses evolve over time and under what contexts in foreign affairs.
We know that disinformation and fake news are important issues in world
politics and that they are frequently used to bring an issue to public
attention, but we are more in the dark over the contextual and temporal
nuances that drive how these concepts are discursively constructed in
foreign policy discourse.¶ This study aims to provide an early addition
to the emerging literature on foreign policy uses of disinformation
discourses by focusing on how the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) has used them in its documents and social media posts. It does so
by studying 238,452 tweets from offcial NATO and affliated accounts, and
more than 2,000 NATO texts, news, statements, and publications using
computational methods since January 2014 and presents an unsupervised
structural topic model (stm) analysis to explore the main thematic and
discursive contexts of these texts. Ultimately, we hope to trigger a
wider debate on the securitization of disinformation and fake news in
foreign policy, and the greater explanatory value of computational
methods in studying large-N text data in studying such securitization
strategies.¶ 2 Securitizing Disinformation¶ Over the last few years,
defining what misleading content is and how to measure the legitimacy of
its dissemination has been at the forefront of journalistic, political
and scientific debate (Tandoc et al., 2018). Even before its
proliferation in 2016, disinformation was a widely-used term in the
mainstream discourse, co-existing with other terms such as infoglut, or
information overload (Andrejevic, 2013). Although at first
disinformation and misinformation were terms used interchangeably,
today, disinformation refers to the deliberate dissemination of false
information with the intention to mislead and confuse its audiences.
Misinformation, on the other hand, strictly defines unintended diffusion
of false information by mistake, without malintent. There are also
bridge terms such as 'malinformation' that is factually accurate but is
deployed to harm and damage an individual or an entity, or the concept
of 'problematic information' as defined by Caroline Jack (Jack, 2017;
Morgan, 2018). Although it is not directly mentioned, all of these
concepts refer to the digital space, where information manipulation is
disseminated faster and wider on social media and digital communication
technologies compared to more media forms of media.¶ [As terms
'disinformation/misinformation', 'fake news', 'information operation',
and 'hybrid war' are often used interchangeably in political discourse,
there are no clear-cut differences in the strategic topic of each word
choice (Guess, Lyons, 2020). Politicians and leaders can often use these
terms as a bag of buzzwords, without a clear operational definition of
what each of them precisely means]{.underline}. Each of these buzzwords
generate roughly the same effect on the consumers of such messages,
which is the delegitimization of their target (Tucker et al., 2018).
[Especially problematic is the fact that once the discourse on
disinformation is weaponized to delegitimize rivals, there is very
little such rivals can do to defend themselves]{.underline}. Given the
significant political charge of these terms, individuals or institutions
that are alleged to be engaging in disinformation-related activities
often have to enter into a fruitless spar of words to challenge such
allegations, which usually leads to further controversy. [This renders
the accuser - or the side that securitizes disinformation - more
advantageous compared to the accused, generating a dynamic similar to
the 'attacker's advantage' in cyber security where the defender is
continuously blindsided]{.underline} (Tong et al., 2020).¶ Therefore,
the securitization of disinformation - that is, discursively
constructing disinformation as a security concern - is becoming almost
as controversial as disinformation itself, and can often be deployed to
muddle the waters of a healthy debate. [Its problem lies within its
success; namely how successfully disinformation gets securitized and
rallies policy resources around itself.]{.underline} This fits into
Buzan et. al. criteria for a 'successful speech-act', which takes places
in a medium most appropriate for its dissemination and have a clear,
mobilizable referent object (i.e. 'those that spread disinformation')
(Buzan et al., 1998). [By securitizing disinformation in the medium that
is most conducive for its dissemination (social media and Internet),
speakers get a chance to use the speed and volume advantage of digital
communication technologies against their opponents. Also, such
discursive constructions must be sedimented (1) rhetorically: have a
clear argumentative function, (2) discursively: contain clear power and
hegemonic relations within, (3) culturally: refer to a well-known case
or instance, and (4) institutionally: in a way that mobilizes policy
resources (Williams, 2003).¶]{.underline} Yet for the Copenhagen school,
not all speech acts constitute securitization. Securitization is a very
particular discursive construct that designates a specific existential
threat that requires the mobilization of uncommon resources and measures
that go beyond the norms of institutional and political responses
(Knudsen, 2001). [In many cases, securitization happens to trigger and
facilitate these institutional changes by 'shocking' power brokers and
bureaucracies into action either through internal bureaucratic peer
pressure, or through public opinion pressure (audience costs). As such,
disinformation has been lifted 'above politics' in Western rhetoric as a
peculiar threat that requires a sidelining of daily political squabbles,
mobilizing unique resources and addressing it in unity that would
otherwise cannot materialize (Buzan, Wæver, 2009). Ultimately the
discursive constructions of disinformation do constitute acute cases of
securitization as they generate amity-enmity relations among countries
that adopt this discursive strategy, versus those that do not (Buzan,
Wæver, 2009).]{.underline}

#### Hybrid warfare discourse displaces security anxieties by framing Russia as an evil Other that must be contained- it results in limited understanding of the root causes of war and turns the case

Computational Text Analysis." SSRN. 4/5/2022. Pg 2-16. LJS

[To sum up, NATO's discourse on disinformation presents a discursive
continuity and is broadly in line with its securitization preferences
prior to the popularization of the terms 'fake news' or 'information
operations'. By leveraging a buzzword that has mainstream popularity,
NATO's discursive efforts refocus the alliance's strategic agenda back
on Russia, and semantically clusters these securitization moves on
existing competition areas with Moscow]{.underline}. Since
securitization is the process by which regular events, actors and
phenomena are elevated into a policy frame that requires special
measures, NATO's disinformation discourse directly fits into the
theoretical spectrum. NATO's 2018 Brussels Summit Declaration and the
2019 London Declaration both prioritized disinformation as a major,
strategic-level alliance threat and combating information warfare have
been integrated into NATO military exercises since 2017. [NATO has been
running wargames that focus on coordinated, Russian-origin
disinformation campaigns against NATO battlegroups in Latvia, Lithuania,
and Poland and has been investing in the establishment of new digital
countermeasure labs]{.underline} (NATO, 2020). [In other words, as a
successful securitization effort, disinformation has been receiving
ample attention, resources and cohesion-building initiatives within the
NATO framework.]{.underline} As part of this strategy, NATO's
securitization efforts have a clear securitizing agent (alliance),
existential threat (Russian-origin information warfare), a referent
object (alliance cohesion, electoral integrity) and an audience
(international public opinion), along with new doctrinal changes and
investment schemees.¶ 5 Discussion and Conclusion¶ Our analysis has
shown that NATO has developed two disinformation-related communication
strategies for two outlets: a more up-to-date and faster-developing
threat discourse for its Twitter presence, and a more traditional,
slow-moving threat presence visible in its offcial documents. This is
particularly interesting and acutely visible in more 20th century
military topics like command and control cohesion, missile defense, air
defense architecture, naval defense, satellites and military
intelligence-related topics that are more frequently mentioned in
offcial documents, and much less referenced on Twitter. However, the
overwhelming majority of disinformation, misinformation, hybrid war,
information warfare and fake news-related communication topics are
securitized on Twitter. This shows the emergence of two NATO discourses:
one for its offcial documents, and one for its social media presence and
messaging.¶ The advent of digital communication technologies and social
media has been significant for the evolution of securitization. [Since
securitization entails production and dissemination of insecurity frames
through discursive networks, a more dynamic, interconnected information
ecosystem is more conducive for collective meaning-making]{.underline}.
On social media, the formation of insecurity processes are more rapid
and interactive, and are able to influence and alter traditional, boring
securitizing acts of elites. To that end, media outlets like Twitter
provide a more interactive and fast-paced securitizing environment where
elites and non-elites can set the security agenda and mobilize masses.
The most clear expression of this novel medium, as demonstrated in our
results, is that NATO's Twitter securitization efforts change much
faster, and spread more widely than traditional outlets like offcial
speeches, texts and reports.¶ This could be interpreted in two ways:
first, that NATO may prefer securitizing disinformation exclusively on
Twitter, since such threats are generally more visible and debated on
social media platforms. The second interpretation is that NATO's offcial
statements and documents could largely be focusing on macrolevel
doctrinal issues that pose a direct military security threat to its
members, rather than disinformation, which is a nuisance, but poses no
direct military threat. Since disinformation is being discussed in
contemporary policy debates within the context of electoral integrity
and social polarization, their actual military relevance may be less
relevant to be taken into account in formal NATO documents. [In either
case, our study of the NATO lexicon demonstrated that disinformation and
related terms are constructed as uniquely 'Russian'
nuisances]{.underline}. This isn't surprising since most of these
terms - at least their digital interpretations - have entered the NATO
lexicon after the Russian military involvement in eastern Ukraine and
Crimea. [However, since then, Russia remained the only country against
which NATO has constructed its disinformation narratives, indicating
that Russia is NATO's sole disinformation concern]{.underline}. Although
very recently China has emerged as a runner-up country within the
context of COVID-related disinformation concerns, Russia is largely the
main threat in NATO's lexicon. [This could be counterproductive to
long-term NATO efforts to combat disinformation, given the global
prevalence of fake news and information meddling. While Russian
disinformation efforts are observably valid, cornering a universal
problem like disinformation into the limited space of NATO's
interactions with a single country may lead to conceptual contraction.
This in turn, may prevent NATO from mobilizing full alliance resources
against disinformation, defined as a global and universal problem.¶
Overall, our analysis has shown that NATO still defines its security
identity against Russia, and there isn't a significant shift in NATO's
securitization dynamics since the Cold War, evidenced by our comparative
analysis of older and newer NATO texts]{.underline}. Although Chinese
disinformation attempts have also begun to enter into NATO threat
language, NATO's primary discursive security identity continues to
develop against and around Russia. This is most evident in our
longitudinal analysis or pre- and post-2014 documents that prioritize
Russia as a threat alike, implying that it is not really disinformation
or fake news agenda that is rendering Russia a threat for NATO. [This
suggests the hypothesis that even if technologies change, NATO-Russia
rivalry will remain securitized the same way. In other words,
contemporary disinformation and fake news agenda is a continuation of
the same NATO-Russia rivalry -- at least in discursive form -- through
newer mediums.]{.underline}

### Liberal International Order

#### The liberal international order is based on a classist and Eurocentric ideology that legitimates western ways of life will masking the extreme racial and economic inequality exacerbated by its policies

INDERJEET **PARMAR in 2018**

international politics at city, university of London; The US-led liberal
order:¶ imperialism by another name?; International Affairs 94: 1 (2018)

[It is widely agreed that the US-led liberal international
order]{.underline} (LIO) [is]{.underline} at the¶ very least [in
transition]{.underline}, if not in crisis.1 This article raises a number
of significant¶ questions with the aim of clarifying the current
conjuncture in the US-led LIO,¶ with particular attention to the
academic 'theory' (liberal internationalism) that¶ underpins the system.
Above all, it asks[: is liberal internationalism a
legitimating]{.underline}¶ [ideology more than it is a description or
theoretical explanation of the existing]{.underline}¶
[system?]{.underline} I explore this question by considering several
specific sub-questions, the¶ cumulative effect of which is to provide
pathways to address the main issue: How¶ did we get here? Who built the
order? What were the foundational principles in¶ theory and practice?
How has the international order's leadership managed change¶ within it
since 1945?¶ I address these questions by considering detailed examples
of actual practice¶ by US and allied elite leadership groups at key
moments: first, in conceptualizing¶ and building the order, both during
and immediately after the Second World War,¶ by exploring the creation
of the South Korean state; and second, in looking at¶ the management of
change and challenges---in particular, the (re-)emergence of¶ China as a
Great Power. Both cases are claimed by leading liberal
internationalists¶ as primary examples of the successes of the LIO:
hence, examining these cases in¶ some detail allows us to compare
liberal internationalist rationales---and the stated¶ aims of
policy-makers---with historical and contemporary evidence. The overall
finding is [that liberal internationalist thinking/theory is, in
effect]{.underline}¶ [(albeit unconsciously]{.underline} on the part of
its proponents), **[a legitimating ideology rather]{.underline}**¶
**[than an effective explanatory frame for understanding the way in
which the LIO]{.underline}**¶ **[actually works]{.underline}**. That
conclusion is reached, in part, by suggesting the applicability¶ of a
rather different perspective on the operations of the LIO and US power:¶
specifically, a synthesized Gramscian--Kautskyian framework, explained
below.¶ The key point is that **[the LIO is a class-based, elitist
hegemony]{.underline}**---[strongly]{.underline}¶ [imbued with explicit
and implicit racial and]{.underline} colonial/[imperial
assumptions]{.underline}---[in]{.underline}¶ both [US]{.underline}
domestic and [foreign relations.]{.underline} [At home, this analysis
helps to explain in]{.underline}¶ [part the phenomenon of the 'left
behind' white working/middle class,]{.underline} including¶ the affluent
but economically anxious voters whose salience on the right has
transformed¶ US politics since the Reagan revolution of the 1980s.2
Responding to the¶ (minorities') rights revolution of the 1960s, and the
loss of economic opportunity¶ and decline in living standards due to
technological change and the global redistribution¶ of industry,3 white
working- and middle-class voters drifted towards the¶ Republicans as the
party of low taxes and fiscal conservatism.4 This delivered¶ little¶ in
material terms, however; and, as inequality increased with market
freedom and¶ real wages stagnated, workers in the 'rust belt' and other
areas grew increasingly¶ dissatisfied with the status quo of
establishment politics, their frustration exacerbated¶ by anxieties
about ethno-racial diversity and American identity as the United¶ States
moves towards a society in which whites are a minority.5 The result was¶
the election as president in 2016 of Donald Trump on an overtly
anti-conservative¶ and barely concealed white identity platform at home
and a programme of protectionism¶ and non-interventionism---America
First---abroad.6¶ Yet political dissatisfaction or disaffection was not
confined to the political¶ right.7 'Occupy Wall Street' and other
[movements]{.underline} and groups [vented their anger]{.underline}¶ [at
the inequalities of power, wealth and income, particularly in the wake
of the]{.underline}¶ [Iraq War and the 2008 financial
crisis.]{.underline}8¶ [In external policy, the analysis helps to
explain the]{.underline} difficulty, perhaps the¶
[impossibility,]{.underline}¶ [of the US readily embracing a more
diverse international order]{.underline}, [as]{.underline}¶ [well as the
character of that very embrace]{.underline}.9 Accepting nations of the
global South¶ on an equal footing may become a strategic necessity, but
[the process remains problematic given the racialized discourses of
western power over]{.underline} the past several¶ [centuries, fortified
in the United States by the experience of the slave trade]{.underline},
slavery,¶ the 'Jim Crow' era, [Orientalist views of Asians, and other
factors]{.underline}.10 **[Class power]{.underline}**¶ **[helps to
explain the strategic embrace of foreign elites as the sources of change
and]{.underline}**¶ **[the agents of American influence]{.underline}**,
[however diluted it may have been due to target]{.underline}¶ [states'
national interest considerations]{.underline}. [Those at the apex of
America's hierarchies]{.underline}¶ [sought to forge alliances
with]{.underline} and incorporate [their foreign elite
counterparts]{.underline}---¶ with their full cooperation---in South
Korea and China.11 Hence, [the liberal internationalist]{.underline}¶
['successes']{.underline} in the cases of South Korea and China [must be
qualified by]{.underline}¶ [considering the repercussions of developing
market-oriented societies marked by]{.underline}¶ [economic inequality,
rising social unrest and varying degrees of political
repression.]{.underline}¶ In 'successful' China and South Korea, as in
India and other emerging¶ powers, [there remain major challenges
underpinned by profound inequalities in]{.underline}¶ [power, wealth and
income,]{.underline} [associated with a politics that is frequently
class-based]{.underline}¶ [but also heavily racialized and
xenophobic]{.underline}.12

#### The aff's presentation of the international liberal order as a benign good elides its role as a legitimating ideology for racial and class hierarchies within and between nations-it views western values as essential in intervening to tame racially inferior cultures

INDERJEET **PARMAR in 2018**

Professor of international politics and head of department of
international politics at city, university of London; The US-led liberal
order:¶ imperialism by another name?; International Affairs 94: 1 (2018)
151--172; doi: 10.1093/ia/iix240

[Liberal internationalism is a]{.underline}n ambiguous, [multifaceted
approach to]{.underline} understanding,¶ explaining, [justifying and
practising international politics.]{.underline} [One aspect of it is
as]{.underline}¶ [a positive theory taught in]{.underline} academic
International Relations ([IR),]{.underline} derived from¶ liberalism as
applied to international affairs, explaining how the foreign policies
of¶ leading states, especially the United States and Britain, work. [It
is also a normative]{.underline}¶ [world-view]{.underline}, used by some
of its proponents [to indicate what the world ought to]{.underline}¶
[look like]{.underline} and how it might, and frequently does, work.
[Liberal internationalism]{.underline},¶ therefore, **[is also a set of
policies]{.underline}**, institutions and established practices.13¶ As
an IR theory, [the key pillars of liberalism]{.underline}, as embodied
in liberal societies,¶ [are limited government]{.underline}, individual
freedom, private property, [pluralism]{.underline} and¶ tolerance,
progress, [institutions and cooperation for peace]{.underline}, and
interdependence.¶ As a theory of US foreign policy, which is the object
of analysis here, [it encompasses]{.underline}¶ democratic values,
economic interdependence, [international institutions as]{.underline}¶
[a framework for cooperation]{.underline} [in addressing global
crises]{.underline} and problems, and the¶ broad promotion of general
welfare. Emerging historically from the era of rising¶ anti-colonialism
and anti-imperialism, with the United States and Britain in the¶ lead,
[the US-led order laid claims to being opposed to colonial
rule]{.underline}, and in favour¶ of national and human rights, within a
system of international power undergirded¶ by rules binding hegemon and
others alike. [It was promoted]{.underline} not as a continuation¶ of
empire by other means, but [as a new system based on universalistic
principles]{.underline}¶ applicable to all regardless of race, colour or
history.¶ For my immediate purposes, it is unnecessary to disentangle
the positive from the¶ normative, the theoretical from the practical,
because this framework of thought¶ emerges both from deep principles and
also as a set of solutions to international¶ problems, especially world
wars. Hence, liberal internationalism is frequently¶ referred to as
Wilsonianism, after the internationalist programme promulgated¶ by US
President Woodrow Wilson after the First World War that included the¶
formation of the League of Nations, the forerunner of the longer-lasting
post-1945¶ United Nations system.¶ I argue here that, **[as a theory, it
operates as ideological legitimation even when]{.underline}**¶ **[its
proponents offer reform]{.underline}**; **[it justifies the status
quo]{.underline}**. In that regard it differs little¶ overall from other
theories like Marxism, for example, or realism. But [because
it]{.underline}¶ [is the principal system of ideas]{.underline} and
practices, and ideals, that are [used to explain,]{.underline}¶
implement and defend [the]{.underline} present [international status
quo, I would suggest that]{.underline}¶ **[it elides too much to be
fully validated]{.underline}** beyond the circle of its proponents. Of¶
course, it explains aspects of the world's functioning; but [its
interpretation tends]{.underline}¶ [to be benign]{.underline}:
**[crises]{.underline}** and challenges **[are explained as resolvable
within the system's]{.underline}**¶ **[governing
principles]{.underline}** through socialization, integration and
assimilation.¶ I use the term liberal internationalism, then, as an
amalgam to suggest that,¶ while it is all of the above, upon reflection
[it serves]{.underline} within academia and in IR [as a]{.underline}¶
[positive theory of how things actually are]{.underline}---that is, as
the opposite of an ideology.¶ [It purports to be able to explain the
world]{.underline}, at the same time as its adherents are¶ normative
supporters of the theory. I show that **[it is actually
ideological]{.underline}**, **[because]{.underline}**¶ **[it elides key
factors of how the liberal world order actually works]{.underline}**,
and that other¶ theories suggest better ways of explaining the world.¶
In the next section of the article, I analyse liberal internationalist
ideas and¶ claims in more depth and more critically, with a view to
identifying key elements¶ of a more viable framework to explain the
LIO---a critical theory influenced by¶ the work of Antonio Gramsci and
to some extent synthesized with the work of¶ Karl Kautsky. The principal
aim of this article is to identify the weaknesses of¶ liberal
internationalism in practice with the purpose of opening space for
subsequent¶ theorizing. In sum, [what appears to be missing from liberal
internationalism]{.underline}¶ [is any recognition of domestic power
inequalities]{.underline}---**[such as those based on]{.underline}**¶
**[class and race]{.underline}**---[its broad attachment to]{.underline}
(democratic) [elitism]{.underline}, **[and its
hierarchical]{.underline}**¶ **[approach to other powers]{.underline}**,
especially in the global South.¶ While Wilsonian liberal
internationalism is widely recognized as privileging a¶ belief in the
free movement of people, capital, goods and services, [less attention
has]{.underline}¶ [been given to its origins in a time when
'international relations' was overtly understood]{.underline}¶ [as 'race
relations', and its consequent implication in managing overtly
racialized]{.underline}¶ [imperial power]{.underline} after the First
World War.14 The Wilson administration's role¶ in racially segregating
the US federal government had its foreign policy counterpart¶ in a
belief in an eventual, but far distant, self-government of the colonies¶
and opposition to a Japanese proposal for a racial equality clause in
the charter of¶ the fledgling League of Nations.15 [The development of
liberal internationalism,]{.underline}¶ then, **[was symbiotically bound
to Wilson's conviction that US intervention in]{.underline}**¶ **[world
affairs was essential]{.underline}**, and to what were effectively
parastatal organizations¶ created both by the federal executive and by
private foundations---the Carnegie¶ Endowment for International Peace,
among others. [Wilsonian 'theory' was]{.underline}¶ practical,
idealistic and **[ideological from the very beginning]{.underline}**. It
is also the case¶ that, [long after overt racial discourses became
politically damaging, subliminal]{.underline}¶ [racial
thinking]{.underline} remained---and (unconsciously)
[remains]{.underline}---**[a significant element of]{.underline}**¶
**[liberal internationalism]{.underline}**, affecting its analyses of
the politics of domestic and global¶ demographic power shifts.16¶
Nevertheless, liberal internationalists are cosmopolitans---opposed to
narrow¶ nationalism and trade protectionism, within a US-led
international system. But [its]{.underline}¶ [core
ideas]{.underline}---[rule of law, superiority of the western
idea]{.underline} (however lightly worn[),]{.underline}¶ [a rules-based
institutional order open to all, in principle]{.underline}---**[are
deeply embedded]{.underline}**¶ **[in]{.underline}** US
political-intellectual elite think-tanks, university public policy
schools,¶ corporate media and the leaderships of both main political
parties,17 **[the core of]{.underline}**¶ **[the white Anglo-Saxon
Protestant establishment.]{.underline}**18 Importantly, however, there¶
are influential voices in the emerging powers and regions that support
the liberal¶ international order by calling for internal reform to take
account of the changing¶ distribution of global power away from the West
and towards the 'rest'.19

### MIC

#### Your presumption should be that all aff evidence is a pile of lies- their authors have specific political and economic incentives to overstate threats and hype the value of the MIC

Edmund F. **Byrne in 2017**

Indiana University-Purdue University,¶ Indianapolis, IN, USA; Military
Industrial Complex (MIC); Springer International Publishing AG 2017¶
D.C. Poff, A.C. Michalos (eds.), Encyclopedia of Business and
Professional Ethics,¶ DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-23514-1_209-1

"[The]{.underline} military-industrial complex" ([MIC) refers to¶ a
self-sustaining politico-economic system that¶ perpetuates profitability
in military supplies¶ industries]{.underline}, de facto in multiple
countries but [primarily in the USA.]{.underline} It is made up of
competing¶ and/or collaborating entities -- **[the maintenance of¶ which
is on the whole financially advantageous to¶ all concerned. These
include professional soldiers]{.underline}**¶ et al., **[managers and
owners of industries that¶ supply military equipment, government
officials¶ whose careers and interests are tied to military¶
expenditure, and legislators whose districts benefit from defense
procurement]{.underline}** (Rosen 1973,¶ pp. 1--2). [The complex
business objectives sought¶ by these]{.underline} and other related
[personnel are]{.underline} **[fostered¶ in part by exalting technical
possibilities but also¶ by spreading fear as to dangers that are
imminent¶ and can be countered only by maintaining the¶ highest feasible
level of military preparedness]{.underline}**¶ (Hallowell 2016). In
pursuit of these objectives,¶ [MIC participants' budgetary requests
amount to¶ meticulously orchestrated industry advertising¶ portrayed as
strategic force requirements]{.underline}. Given¶ this state of affairs,
**[the preeminent business ethical questions with regard to an MIC
involve ends¶ as well as means]{.underline}**, i.e., not only **[death
and destruction but systemically inherent pork and
waste]{.underline}**.¶ C. Wright Mills (1956) formulated the concept of¶
an MIC, and President Dwight Eisenhower¶ famously warned about it in his
1961 Farewell¶ Address. The entity itself had come into being¶ during
WWII as competing countries built up¶ their military hardware in concert
with the buildup of military manpower. [When]{.underline} that [war came
to a¶ cataclysmic end]{.underline}, the losers' industries were¶
severely pacified; but [the winners,]{.underline} especially [in¶ the
USA]{.underline}, [intensified their production of¶ warmaking equipment
and]{.underline}, no less assiduously,¶ **[their search for enemies
against whom that equipment could be used]{.underline}** (short of
nuclear holocaust).¶ And whenever so used **[if not used up the user¶
government needed to fund so-called defense¶ industry corporations to
replace shortfalls of old¶ equipment; and]{.underline}**, increasingly,
**[this process of¶ replacing the old came to be supplemented with¶
projects to introduce new means of mayhem¶ aimed at meeting speculative
future challenges]{.underline}**.¶ If this industry consisted as do
others of freestanding companies that respond to changes in the¶ market
by changing their mix of products to¶ remain relevant, its list of
products would have¶ changed considerably over the past seventy-some¶
years. And in fact, [budgetary reductions were at¶ times deemed
circumstantially possible and desirable,]{.underline} e.g., at the end
of a war, notably that in¶ Vietnam, or more so following the demise of
the¶ USSR. [MIC companies]{.underline} are not free-standing,¶ however,
but [depend on government funding the¶ size of which is based on a need
to confront¶ dangers that seemingly can only increase]{.underline}.
[Thus¶ challenged the industry seldom discontinues old¶
products]{.underline}, not even if the military itself asserts no¶ need
for them[; and new products are rarely left¶ unfunded merely because
experts claim they will¶ never be effective]{.underline}. In an
artificial budgetary climate like this, in which careful estimates of¶
demonstrable need are seldom relied on, budgetary bottom lines are more
likely to be derived¶ from actual confrontations such as the September¶
11, 2001, attacks. For these lend weight to estimates of risks posed by
terrorists whose defeat¶ will require a massive infusion of funds into
companies whose products and services will be¶ needed if the nation is
to be adequately¶ "defended."¶ [The MIC's monetary distribution system¶
involves interdependencies so complex that¶ downsizing]{.underline},
never mind abolishing, [it is generally¶ deemed virtually unthinkable.
Lobbyists for the¶ contractors]{.underline} [give]{.underline} their
[preferences]{.underline} weight **[by distributing vast sums of money
to parties issuing¶ contracts through the US]{.underline}** Department
of Defense¶ (**[DoD]{.underline}**) (OpenSecrets.org 2015). In addition,
[the¶ actual manufacture of parts for weapons systems¶ is distributed
among plants deliberately located in¶ most if not every Congressional
district]{.underline}.¶ [A Congressional representative's campaign
contributions]{.underline}, hence voter support, **[ultimately depend¶
on his or her level of support for the budget from¶ which local defense
manufacturers receive their¶ contracts]{.underline}**. Governmental
public and nonpublic¶ MIC employees similarly risk losing their jobs if¶
they are not supportive of this system in every¶ way (Hartung 2011,
Chap. 1; Reich 2010). Apart¶ from these domestic arrangements, many of
the companies dealing with DoD are multinational in¶ scope, and thus so
is the US MIC. Non-US¶ weapons procurers deal directly not with
contractors but with Foreign Military Sales (FMS), a¶ program in DoD,
that uses the Defense Security¶ Cooperation Agency as its intermediary.

#### The MIC is a result of economic crises generated by capitalism. Their authors are corrupt with specific incentives to continue this system- the result is that the "efficiencies" the aff proclaims come from stripping away money from other needs

[The military-industrial complex]{.underline} that Eisenhower (1961)
**[warned of has become a vast network of¶ expanded political
power]{.underline}**, enlarged **[profits]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} increased state [authority]{.underline}. Indeed,
[national¶ security]{.underline}, in terms of dollars, mentality, and
interests, [has bled into nearly every aspect of¶ American
life]{.underline} (Turse 2008), [creeping]{.underline}
[into]{.underline} nearly every federal department (Mueller and Stewart¶
2011), into domestic and [international humanitarian
efforts]{.underline} (Coyne 2008, 2013), and even into¶ domestic
policing (Hall and Coyne 2013). The result has been a lasting impact on
the evolution¶ and structure of private industry (Duncan and Coyne
forthcoming). [Defense funding goes not¶ only to giants]{.underline}
like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, [but also filters through¶
subcontractors and supportive non-military firms]{.underline} and
organizations **[to influence "professional¶ and business
services]{.underline}**, financial, information and administrative
services, retail trade, leisure and¶ hospitality services, education and
health services, construction, and other manufacturing"¶ (Fuller 2011,
1). [How did this permanent war economy emerge]{.underline}?¶ This paper
answers this important question. Our analysis emphasizes [the combined¶
efforts of three key interest grou]{.underline}ps (unions, industry,
military) [that arose in the context of the¶ dual crises of the Great
Depression and World War II]{.underline}. In any good crisis, there are
multiple¶ parties ready to take advantage of the state of emergency
(Higgs 1987, 2004, 2005a, 2006, 2012).¶ During the depression and the
war that followed, **[a partnership between industry, the military,¶ and
politicians emerged]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} Great Depression
and World [War]{.underline} II [resulted in]{.underline} [increased
spending¶ by government]{.underline}, **[and a variety of interests
groups took advantage of the opportunity to advance¶ their
interests]{.underline}**: unions with jobs, industry with profits,
military branches with budgets, and¶ [politicians with votes and
lobbying stemming from the support of these interests]{.underline}.
These crises, ¶ combined with the State's monopoly over the military,
created the opportunity for these interests¶ to influence the trajectory
of economic activity in a lasting, and self-serving, manner.¶ This paper
contributes to two interrelated strands of literature. Firstly, we
contribute to¶ the literature on the origins of the permanent war
economy (Oakes 1944; Vance 1951a, 1951b,¶ 1951c, 1951d, 1951e, 1951f;
Baran and Sweezy 1966; Vatter 1985). This literature emphasizes¶ how
**[the origin of the permanent war economy was a solution to the
unemployment problem that¶ plagued capitalism]{.underline}**. Our
explanation, in contrast, emphasizes **[the central role of
government's¶ monopoly on the military and the desire of powerful
special interests to secure the rents of that¶ monopoly]{.underline}**
in the context of the crises of the Great Depression and World War II.¶
Secondly, we extend the literature on [the distortionary effects of the
permanent war¶ economy]{.underline} (Russet 1971; Melman 1970, 1971,
1985; Rothbard 1989; Higgs 2006; Duncan and¶ Coyne forthcoming) [by
linking its origin and perpetuation to special interests. Those who
argue¶ for the necessity of a constant state of military readiness tend
to overlook]{.underline}, or at least¶ underestimate, [the negative
effects of military spending in terms of rent-seeking behaviors by¶
private interests.]{.underline} While [the permanent war
economy]{.underline} generates a mutual benefit for government¶ and
private interests, it also [generates a significant negative externality
by diverting resources¶ from other, private uses.]{.underline}

#### The aff is corrupt through its core- it relies on a cadre of "experts" that financially gain from inflating the importance of the MIC- even a 'state planned' war economy ensures corruption

By war's end, [all three interest groups]{.underline}---the
[military]{.underline}, organized [labor]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
war-related private¶ [industry]{.underline}---[had experienced
the]{.underline} [monetary and political gains offered by the dual
crises of¶ depression and war. The iron triangle was
complete]{.underline}, with the vested interests of "\[b\]ig business,¶
including its powerful friends and representatives..., and the newly but
vastly empowered¶ military establishment together," which "formed a
potent political faction" (Higgs 2006, 73). As¶ "\[u\]nions could not
afford endlessly to neglect their immediate self-interest," organized
labor¶ also remained "a junior partner in the postwar complex"
(Koistinen 1973, 477). [Despite popular¶ sentiment for a respite from
the war effort, demobilization was short-lived, as American military¶
planners were already looking at the Soviet Union as the source of the
next crisis with which to¶ exert their influence]{.underline} (Biddle
2007, 141). With only a short pause to gather its strength, the¶
military-industrial complex found itself attempting to influence policy
against a potential threat¶ that would last for over four decades (see,
for instance, Lazarowitz 2005). And, [in the post-9/11 ¶ world, the
military-industrial complex has again shifted focus to the transnational
"War on¶ Terror" which has further extended and sustained the permanent
war economy]{.underline}. Indeed, as¶ Mueller (2006) shows, **[an entire
"terrorism industry]{.underline}**" **[consisting of
consultants]{.underline}**, counter-terrorism¶ **[experts, and pundits
has emerged]{.underline}** in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.¶ In addition
to providing insight into the origins of the permanent war economy,
[our¶ analysis has broader implications regarding the relationship
between capitalism and foreign¶ military imperialism]{.underline}.19
Some [critics of capitalism view foreign intervention as a logical¶
outgrowth of this type of economic system]{.underline} (see Oakes 1944;
Vance 1951a, 1951b, 1951c, 1951d,¶ 1951e, 1951f; Baran and Sweezy 1966;
Vatter 1985; Hossein-Zadeh 2006). From this¶ perspective foreign
exploits provide a means for politically-connected capitalists to earn¶
significant profits. **[These critics are right]{.underline}**, at least
to a degree. What these critics are really¶ highlighting [is a flaw in
capitalism whereby investors and entrepreneurs are indifferent, at the¶
margin, between additional rents earned by seducing government and
additional profits earned¶ by creating new and cheaper
products]{.underline} which benefit the general public (see Buchanan
1980).¶ In the context of foreign military interventions, this implies
that, **[given the chance, self interested capitalists will gladly
engage in a mutually beneficial exchange with the state monopoly
provider of military services]{.underline}**. **[Private companies offer
campaign contributions and¶ political support, and politicians and state
bureaucrats offer rents in return.]{.underline}** **[Although both
parties¶ are privately made better off, there is a significant negative
externality of allowing this exchange¶ because the permanent war economy
diverts productive resources away from other uses that¶ improve general
standards of living]{.underline}** (see Duncan and Coyne, forthcoming).
¶ How is this dilemma to be resolved? [One solution is to adopt a
completely planned¶ economic system for military and defense
production]{.underline} which removes capitalists from the process ¶
altogether. **[The flaw with this alternative]{.underline}**, however,
**[is that it assumes that government,]{.underline}** absent¶ crony
capitalists, **[will have less of an incentive to build and use weapons
for imperialistic¶ purposes]{.underline}**. The field of public choice,
which demands the symmetry of assumptions between¶ private and public
actors, calls this assumption into question. Further, [historical
evidence also¶ provides countless instances of government abuse of its
monopoly on military force]{.underline}.

### NATO

#### Integration with NATO serves to legitimate and enforce capitalist social relations globally- it elides the exploitation of other countries through economic and physical violence as a necessary mechanism for maintaining capitalism at home

INDERJEET **PARMAR in 2018**

Professor of international politics and head of department of
international politics at city, university of London; The US-led liberal
order:¶ imperialism by another name?; International Affairs 94: 1 (2018)
151--172; doi: 10.1093/ia/iix240

The upshot is a broad consensus around certain core ideas: that the
post-1945¶ rules-based world order, whatever its weaknesses, serves the
world well by¶ spreading prosperity and maintaining peace; and that,
although it cannot continue¶ unreformed, [the US-led system draws on
deep resources]{.underline}---economic, military,¶ systemic and
'soft'---[that bestow upon it continuing strengths to]{.underline}
contain, engage,¶ [manage]{.underline} and socialize [emerging
powers]{.underline}. Charles Kupchan lists a range of problems¶
requiring US leadership, even if only within a suitably reformed
international¶ system reflecting 'the real distribution of power'.20¶
John Ikenberry of Princeton University, the leading proponent of this
school¶ of thought, makes significant claims as well as several
unquestioned assumptions,¶ undeveloped allusions to core powers' violent
and other connections with the¶ periphery, and a number of significant
silences. He claims, for example, that the¶ United States is a fully
functioning democracy, yet fails to acknowledge evidence¶ of the power
of racialized, class-based elites. For critical theorists, such as
Robert¶ Cox, Stephen Gill and Craig Murphy,21 [the international
relations of elites across]{.underline}¶ [states]{.underline} and
societies [operate to reproduce]{.underline} extant [patterns of
power]{.underline} and manage [or]{.underline}¶ [engineer change to the
benefit of elites]{.underline} in a generally zero-sum game in which¶
broad masses and lower classes lose out. [This is clearly a far cry from
liberal internationalist]{.underline}¶ [claims associated with the
benefits of globalization]{.underline}, notwithstanding proposed
ameliorative remedies against the harshest effects. Likewise, claims
about¶ the centrality of the rule of law occlude consideration of
significant violations¶ in practice. [The question of imperial power is
hardly addressed]{.underline}, [and there is a]{.underline}¶ [general
Eurocentric neglect of the significance of global areas beyond the
core]{.underline} to¶ the 'welfare' and cohesion of the core itself.
There is a clear link between Ikenberry's¶ overt theory of American
democracy and its liberal-hegemonic world role.¶ [The United
States]{.underline}, and the western order it built, [is characterized
as a pluralistic]{.underline}¶ [liberal market democracy that is broadly
inclusive]{.underline} and tolerant of ethnic diversity.¶ [The US-built
security community exhibits its leading state's internal character
as]{.underline}¶ [a plural one and]{.underline}, very significantly,
[one in which the United States is bound by]{.underline}¶
[rules]{.underline}.22 [Yet liberal internationalists' underlying
assumptions effectively deny the]{.underline}¶ [findings of numerous
well-researched studies challenging American democracy's]{.underline}¶
[principal claims]{.underline}.23¶ [As far as Ikenberry]{.underline} and
Deudney ([and]{.underline} many [others) are concerned, the
'western]{.underline}¶ [idea' is a significant part of the strength of
the US-led order]{.underline}.24 [The West]{.underline}, a¶
spectacularly successful 'civilizational heritage', [was underpinned
by]{.underline} America's¶ New Deal liberalism, and extended globally
via Bretton Woods, the Marshall¶ Plan and [NATO.]{.underline} In effect,
[this vision]{.underline} and programme **[aimed to defuse
domestic]{.underline}**¶ **[class conflict and the threat of war
through]{.underline}** 'activist government, political democracy,¶ and
**[international alliance']{.underline}**. [That system is in principle
capable of assimilating]{.underline}¶ [emerging powers]{.underline},
given the universalism of its values and its tolerance of ethnic¶
differences, [although others joining this privileged grouping are
expected to]{.underline}¶ [conform to its rules and accept US
leadership]{.underline}. Western order is exclusive also¶ because
special rules apply within its zone of peace. Beyond it, conversely,
other¶ rules apply---cruder, neo-imperial and violent, although the
implications of this¶ contrast are left unaddressed.25 [By drawing a
line around the West, Ikenberry]{.underline}¶ [cuts off the rest of the
world]{.underline} while addressing questions about the sources of¶
world order which, empirically, lie in a symbiotic relationship between
core and¶ periphery. Yet, even within the 'greater' West, Japan and
South Korea were not¶ accorded the same treatment as western Europe.26
**[The LIO really was conceived]{.underline}**¶ **[and developed as a
system of the West and the rest, in a zero-sum game.]{.underline}** As
Donald¶ Tusk, President of the European Council, noted on Twitter in May
2017, the¶ whole point of 'Euro-Atlanticism' was to 'prevent post-West
world order'.27 [Yet the claim persists that this is no
empire,]{.underline} despite America's privileged place¶ at the top of
the 'hierarchical political order', because its hegemony is built on¶
'consent' and bounded by law. Power, which was necessary at the
creation, faded¶ away as consensual hegemony developed. [This
interpretation]{.underline}, of course, **[elides]{.underline}**¶
**[America's overwhelming military superiority, including in and over
Europe]{.underline}**.¶ Beyond Europe, however, Ikenberry concedes that
American hegemony remained¶ hierarchical, 'with much fainter liberal
characteristics',28 again closing off an avenue¶ of analytical and
empirical analysis that might threaten the intellectual edifice of¶ the
LIO.¶ [The (unconsciously) racialized world-view of Ikenberry's
Eurocentrism]{.underline}¶ [is subtly buttressed by]{.underline} Walter
Russell [Mead's]{.underline} exploration of the significance¶ of
superior Anglo-Saxons who win wars, build world structures, and govern¶
efficiently owing to ethno-cultural, not biological, characteristics.29
Mead's [interpretation]{.underline}¶ [of Anglo-Saxonism]{.underline}
makes it appear benign, assimilative and universal---¶ a scaffolding to
support Ikenberry's more overtly institutional analysis.¶
**[Assimilating minorities, however, is not embracing
diversity]{.underline}**---learning from¶ other cultures and creating
something new; **[it is maintaining conformity to]{.underline}**¶ **[the
cultures of the powerful]{.underline}**, dominant group.30 Looking to
the future, as new¶ global powers emerge, Mead advises America to both
embrace and contain them,¶ retaining military superiority should
'rising' powers become 'opponents'.31 Mead¶ complements the
prescriptions of other liberal-realist internationalists, all seeking¶
to incorporate, assimilate and mobilize emerging powers to absorb
difference and¶ produce conformity.The liberal view is challenged by
scholars who argue that the New Deal¶ order effectively represented a
political compromise, made in order to attain¶ class peace and greater
productivity, that mainly benefited major corporations¶ while
incorporating¶ organized labour and thereby drawing its teeth.
[The]{.underline}¶ [postwar settlement was a narrow
one]{.underline}---[excluding racial minorities]{.underline}, unskilled
and¶ unorganized¶ labour, and women---[and relied on war and a heavily
militarized]{.underline}¶ [economy]{.underline} that arose with the war
in Korea and led directly to that in Vietnam.32¶ **[Liberal
internationalists' accounts elide the class, gendered and racial bases
of the]{.underline}**¶ **[order, both at home and abroad]{.underline}**.
Ikenberry paints an appealing picture of a liberal¶ order that
delivered¶ material benefits and security to all, while also raising
some¶ doubts about the operation of the system, especially with regard
to the inequality¶ of rewards generated by globalization and its
potential political consequences.¶ Those consequences are regarded by
Ikenberry as posing the greatest threats to¶ the stability of the
liberal order, laying bare [a central mechanism and
dynamic]{.underline}¶ [of the system itself: market-driven class
inequality, exacerbated in a society in]{.underline}¶ [which racialized
class politics is salient]{.underline}.33 **[Yet Ikenberry never
mentions class, race or gender]{.underline}**---an omission central to
critical theories of the making of the¶ LIO.34¶ [The other key omission
is the role played in building the order by violence and]{.underline}¶
[outright war]{.underline}---not just the Second World War but also the
Korean War, [the 'hot']{.underline}¶ [war at the birth of the order that
propelled the formation of NATO]{.underline}, the rearmament¶ of
Germany, the security alliance with Japan and indeed the US military--¶
industrial complex.35 Accordingly, a key focus of consideration here is
wartime¶ planning for a new world order and the manner of its foundation
as a direct result¶ of military violence that violated the UN Charter,
international law, the lessons¶ of the Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes
trials, and the 1949 Geneva Conventions.¶ [Wars 'out there' secured the
core 'over here']{.underline}.36¶ And, of course, [what is referred to
as benign 'liberal internationalism' is]{.underline} what¶ Mark Mazower
refers to as '**[imperial internationalism']{.underline}**---**[trying
to maintain a]{.underline}**¶ **[global hierarchy established by
centuries of colonial]{.underline}** and semi-colonial **[rule
over]{.underline}**¶ **[what is now called the global
South]{.underline}**.37¶ Finally, [the construction of the postwar
western order]{.underline} was constitutive of¶ a political, social,
economic and ideological 'vital center', as Schlesinger terms¶
it38---opposed to both right-wing nationalists and left-wing
anti-imperialists.¶ This [entailed the acceptance]{.underline} by core
forces of the 'New Deal order' [that the price]{.underline}¶ [of class
harmony]{.underline}, stability and mobility [at home was the export
and]{.underline} continuation¶ of [inequality]{.underline},39
[and]{.underline} therefore military [violence]{.underline}, [on the
periphery]{.underline}; [and that]{.underline}¶ [the removal of vast
quantities of raw materials required a global military
basing]{.underline}¶ [strategy, both to protect allied trade and to deny
it to adversaries]{.underline}.40 [Ikenberry]{.underline}¶ accurately
notes that the internal character of the leading state in the liberal
order¶ has an impact on the international system it built; but I diverge
from his presentation¶ of this impact as the externalization of a
democratic regime. He [elides]{.underline}¶ [the racial, class and
gendered character of American historical, economic and]{.underline}¶
[political development]{.underline}---including that of Wilsonianism
itself.41 His conclusion,¶ however, is accurate, even if he fails to
recognize its significance in the building¶ and maintenance of the
liberal order: 'Access to resources and markets, socioeconomic¶
stability, political pluralism, and American security interests---all
were¶ inextricably linked.'42¶ The framework that may best fit the
actual underlying engine of liberal orderbuilding¶ and maintenance,
however, must also incorporate understanding of the¶ 'soft' processes of
socialization or incorporation. [Violence is a powerful tool, but always
and everywhere it is connected with the processes of]{.underline}
non-violent elite¶ socialization and [alliance-building]{.underline}. It
is one of the great strengths of Ikenberry's¶ analysis of international
order that elite socialization is considered so significant.¶ 43 [Yet a
critical view of elite socialization]{.underline} in the building and
perpetuation¶ of hegemony [views it not as a reflection]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} a democratic and [benign foreign]{.underline}¶ [policy,
but as incorporation into hegemonic agendas]{.underline} or
'domestication'.44 In the¶ Gramscian perspective[, capitalist Great
Powers]{.underline}, including the United States, **[are]{.underline}**¶
**[deeply unequal at home and imperialistic abroad]{.underline}**,
**[ultimately pursuing the interests]{.underline}**¶ **[of their ruling
classes and elites]{.underline}**, whether embedded in private, public
or state--¶ private realms.45 [Their hegemony is a combination of
persuasion and coercion]{.underline}¶ [involving a 'state--society
complex']{.underline}.46 Admittedly, liberalism gives an account of¶
elite socialization processes that overlaps with Gramscian approaches.
However,¶ liberal approaches see it as relatively benign, politically
neutral or representative¶ of democracy/popular sovereignty.

#### NATO is an institution created to prop up an imperial world order that guarantees the continuation of western capitalism- it generates stability necessary to ensure the flow of goods and resources toward capitalist centers of power

order:¶ imperialism by another name?; International Affairs 94: 1 (2018)

My critical approach connects Gramscian thinking with a largely
forgotten early¶ twentieth-century socialist theoretician of
'ultra-imperialism'---Karl Kautsky.¶ According to Kautsky, in contrast
to Lenin's claim of the inevitability of interimperial¶ wars of
hegemony, ultra-imperialism---the tendency of national ruling¶ classes
to form international class-based alliances to jointly exploit the
world's¶ resources47---leads to cooperation rather than conflict between
capitalist states.¶ Kautsky notes that [inter-capitalist corporate/state
cooperation could take]{.underline}¶ [numerous forms]{.underline}---such
as cartel-like agreements or even the formation of a¶ 'league of
states'.48 Of course, there is a strong tradition of critical thinking
by¶ neo-Gramscians---including Cox and Gill, but also other Marxists
such as Kees¶ van der Pijl49---that extends to the building of
transnational alliances. That¶ work, however, largely focuses on
alliances of the Cold War era between the¶ United States and western
Europe as junior partner. In this article, I consider¶ two Asian
states---South Korea and China---whose political--cultural
incorporation¶ would clearly differ from the Euro-American example. On
the other hand[,]{.underline}¶ [all incorporation processes come up
against strictly national interests and specific]{.underline}¶ [cultural
differences]{.underline}, including in the British case: hence the
controversies over¶ naval armaments in the 1920s and the terms of the
alliance after 1945, the refusal¶ by Prime Minister Harold Wilson to
support the United States with troops in¶ Vietnam and, later, frictions
over the Falklands War.50 The attempt to incorporate¶ any power, great
or small, is always going to be extremely difficult.¶ Kautsky is
forgotten largely because his claim---which essentially suggested¶ there
would be no major war between capitalist Great Powers---was
spectacularly¶ disproved by the outbreak of the First World War.51
However, clearly there are¶ numerous alliances and international
agreements that uphold Kautsky's approach.¶ The EU is a case in
point---a supranational alliance, bringing together several¶ great and
smaller powers with a colonial past, which has effectively prevented¶
war between them and generated enduring cooperation over decades.
Stokes¶ argues that [American power, exercised via the LIO with its
panoply of multilateral]{.underline}¶ [organizations, perfectly
exemplifies ultra-imperialism given its
system]{.underline}-**[maintenance]{.underline}**¶ **[role serving a
range of other states]{.underline}**---much to President Donald¶ Trump's
pluto-populist chagrin.52¶ Kautsky's [ultra-imperialism was hardly a
utopia free of rivalries and wars,]{.underline}¶ however, [given the
levels of exploitation and subordination endemic in
capitalist]{.underline}¶ [international relations.]{.underline}53 Yet
even critics argue that [Kautsky's idea has applicability]{.underline}¶
[to the post-1945 era of the LIO, underpinned by US hegemony
and]{.underline} an¶ influential web of institutions that embed western
powers---[NATO]{.underline}, the IMF,¶ the World Bank and the G7, among
others. Indeed, it could be argued that [since]{.underline}¶ [1989
ultra-imperialism spans virtually the world]{.underline},54 although I
would argue that¶ in the case of China the process began in the late
1970s. Of course, Kautsky is¶ clear that the pattern of international
capitalist alliances is subject to change along¶ with the uneven
development of power and economic strength. Therefore, [we]{.underline}¶
[would expect tensions to emerge within the system of
relationships]{.underline}, despite the¶ basis of shared interests,
[placing great strain on institutions]{.underline} amid muscle-flexing¶
on the part of certain states that feel unduly constrained by the
international¶ system. Hence the current tensions between the Trump
administration and China,¶ Germany, the EU and NATO, for example.
Whether this represents the breakdown¶ of the post-1945 order or its
recalibration remains to be seen.¶ Kautsky is therefore useful for our
understanding of the LIO in two ways:¶ first, in suggesting that,
notwithstanding the emergence of unavoidable tensions,¶ war is not
inevitable between Great Powers, but for reasons rather different from¶
those suggested by liberal internationalism's egalitarian and benign
ideas about¶ interdependence; and second, in pointing out that [Great
Powers, aiming to jointly]{.underline}¶ [promote their power against
others at home]{.underline} and abroad, [build alliances with
their]{.underline}¶ [elite foreign counterparts]{.underline} where they
already hold power or, by extension, where¶ such a nascent elite might
be fostered. Such is the case in the instances of South ¶ Korea and
China discussed below. In neither case is there any suggestion that¶ one
state controls another---the point is that their [ruling elites hold
shared interests,]{.underline}¶ [even if that means their enrichment at
the expense of the broad mass of]{.underline}¶ [their own
people.]{.underline} This analysis challenges Leninist,55 realist and
liberal conceptions¶ of the international order: [the system is imperial
but not necessarily doomed]{.underline}¶ [to perpetual war,]{.underline}
and is not benignly liberal. [This is international 'high'
(class)]{.underline}¶ [politics]{.underline}---[cooperation for shared
narrow self-interest but resting on unstable]{.underline} social¶ and
political [foundations]{.underline}.¶ Ikenberry's benign interpretation
of the US-led order is read back into the activities¶ between 1939 and
1945 of elite planners of the postwar order. Developing the¶ 'Grand
Area' concept, planners in the State Department and the Council on
Foreign¶ Relations (CFR) identified the world zones the United States
'required' in order to¶ avoid having to radically reform its
economy---zones that together encompassed¶ practically the whole
world.56 [The key point elided is that it was to cohere
that]{.underline}¶ [imperial 'Grand Area' that so much of the
institutional architecture of western]{.underline}¶ [power was
built]{.underline}---the IMF and World Bank, the UN, the Marshall Plan,
GATT¶ and [NATO]{.underline}.57 [The interrelations]{.underline} between
the Grand Area's regions [were never]{.underline}¶ [envisaged as being
in any sense equal---raw materials would flow towards
western]{.underline}¶ [reconstruction]{.underline} and social peace,
[and finished industrial goods in the other direction]{.underline}.¶
[The]{.underline} [postwar settlement]{.underline} at home [that
coalesced]{.underline}, as Hogan argues,58 around¶ high-technology
capital-intensive industries, international finance and organized¶
skilled labour, [was located within an international settlement that
secured broad]{.underline}¶ [corporate interests]{.underline} under the
auspices of an interventionist state. And, in that¶ respect, [America's
military capacity to police flows of goods]{.underline} across the world
[was]{.underline}¶ at the very least a part of the reason [why the
United States acquired 'forward]{.underline}¶ [bases in]{.underline}
Asia and [Europe']{.underline}.59 As policy-makers such as Henry Stimson
and John J.¶ McCloy noted, [American and western well-being relied on
'"open markets]{.underline}, access¶ to raw materials, and the
rehabilitation of much---if not all---of Eurasia along¶ liberal
capitalist lines"'.60¶ CFR and State Department wartime [planning
was]{.underline} therefore [driven above all by]{.underline}¶ [a vision
of]{.underline} global--[imperial leadership exercised by US
elites]{.underline}, strongly supported¶ by Britain's ruling elites,
[via an international order of organizations]{.underline} and
relationships.¶ 61 [The aim was,]{.underline} acting in concert with
Britain's elites, [to resurrect European]{.underline}¶ [Great Powers
by]{.underline} means including the r[estoration of]{.underline}
shattered [colonial trading and]{.underline}¶ [economic and financial
linkages]{.underline}. The Marshall Plan viewed European reconstruction¶
in just that global context.62 The UN was envisaged as a key
international¶ agency for American imperial internationalism, at least
in its earliest days63---and, as¶ its role in the making of South Korea
shows, it remains the official basis of America's¶ role in that country
today. And, as I will show below, the building of a hegemonic¶
multilateral order indicates the significance of a Gramsci--Kautsky
synthesis.

#### The US liberal order uses alliance institutions to manage the hierarchical class and race relations that entrench the power of elites at the expense of equality

[The foundational values]{.underline}, interests [and institutions of
the]{.underline} (Anglo-)[US liberal]{.underline}¶
[international]{.underline}¶ [order]{.underline}, with due respect for
important but not fundamental recalibrations¶ and corrections along the
way, **[are the sources of its current crises]{.underline}** or at¶
least challenges. [The]{.underline} mentalities and [power structures of
the LIO's leaders are]{.underline}¶ [constructed by]{.underline}
hierarchical, **[imperial]{.underline}** and racial--civilizational
**[ways of thinking]{.underline}**,¶ albeit in most cases subliminally
embedded to the point of being unconscious¶ deep structures
themselves.117 [The]{.underline} American white Anglo-Saxon Protestant¶
(Wasp) [establishment built]{.underline} and maintained [the liberal
order in a 'competitively]{.underline}¶ [cooperative' alliance with
their British counterparts]{.underline},118 whose own imperial and¶
racial mentalities were hardly in conflict with those of their American
cousins.119¶ [Whatever changes occurred]{.underline} or were forced on
US elites over time, **[those underlying]{.underline}**¶ and mainly
subliminal **[values have remained significant in
decision-making]{.underline}**,¶ including when nurturing new states and
powers such as South Korea and China.¶ [As a result, liberal
internationalism]{.underline} as a 'theory' or approach to world order,¶
eliding and [skirting matters of hierarchy, race and class]{.underline}
just as it does in its outline¶ understandings of American democracy,
[misses a critical part of the picture]{.underline}---[of]{.underline}¶
[the dynamics of international]{.underline} power [as well
as]{.underline} the dynamics of [domestic power]{.underline}.¶ [Because
of that elision]{.underline}, that failure to see, I suggest **[it is a
legitimating ideology of]{.underline}**¶ **[the American ruling
elite]{.underline}**. I have argued above [that the LIO is better
understood as a]{.underline}¶ [system of hierarchy and
inequality]{.underline}, and as what Persaud calls a
'racio-civilizational'¶ phenomenon. What does that mean? It means that
[this system]{.underline} and its leaders [cannot]{.underline}¶ [yet
comprehend an order that encompasses on the basis of something
approaching]{.underline}¶ [equality]{.underline} the broad mass of
people---citizens---at home, let alone the non-western¶ peoples of the
global South, or even their elites. The tweet from Donald Tusk¶ quoted
above is revealing and instructive because it was addressed to
President¶ Trump in simple and stark terms, worth repeating here:
'Euro-Atlanticism means¶ the free world cooperating to prevent post-West
world order'---so, please 'do not¶ touch'. [International
alliances]{.underline} of elites, including those of the emerging
powers¶ such as China, [are in large part attempts to
manage]{.underline} [and]{.underline} channel change to prevent¶ radical
power shifts, to [sustain a world order that serves elites]{.underline}
[and masses]{.underline}, in West¶ and East, **[in starkly unequal
ways]{.underline}**. [A Gramscian--Kautskyian synthesis
combines]{.underline}¶ [consideration of domestic and international
class-based imperial hegemonies and]{.underline}¶ [offers a good
explanation of the existing order]{.underline}. However, [it also offers
a way out]{.underline}, in¶ theory, and provides ways to assess the
likelihood of avenues towards egalitarianism¶ being taken by ruling
elites. [The prognosis is not positive at present]{.underline}, although
the¶ bases of ways forward appear to be coming into view as political
strife and electoral¶ shocks challenge the status quo.120

#### NATO is integral to the social construction of a Western identity that secures liberal values through the use of external threats to our way of life- it creates a passive community that accepts liberal capitalism

Ottawa; NATO, liberal¶ internationalism, and¶ the politics of imagining¶
the Western security¶ community; International Journal¶ 2019, Vol. 74(1)
32--46

In recent years, [there has been renewed interest among]{.underline}
International Relations ([IR)]{.underline}¶ [scholars in the ability of
the Western security community to protect itself from a]{.underline}¶
[variety of threats]{.underline} and challenges. In this context[,
longstanding debates concerning]{.underline}¶ [the role played
by]{.underline} the organization that is widely regarded as the
institutional¶ expression of that community---[NATO]{.underline}---[have
recently taken on new dimensions]{.underline}.¶ Scholars and
policymakers often disagree in their interpretations of the relative¶
strength of NATO, but [many agree that the alliance needs to play a
central role in]{.underline}¶ [protecting the West from a mix of
conventional and non-conventional dangers]{.underline},¶ ranging from an
increasingly assertive Russia to transnational terrorism. [One
of]{.underline}¶ [the key assumptions underpinning many analyses is that
NATO constitutes the]{.underline}¶ [institutional expression of a
pre-existing Western security community united]{.underline}¶ [around
liberal-democratic norms and values]{.underline}. [However]{.underline},
a close reading of the alliance's¶ history shows that, far from simply
representing a pre-given community,¶ **[NATO has always been involved in
constructing ''the West.'']{.underline}** [At the heart of
that]{.underline}¶ [process of social construction lie practices of
collective (re)imagining of the]{.underline}¶ [Western world in specific
ways]{.underline}, [as well as the representation]{.underline}---and
management¶ [of---internal tensions as feuds within a community united
by shared liberal values]{.underline}.¶ Today, [the task of managing
internal differences has been rendered particularly]{.underline}¶
[difficult by the rise of radical conservative political
forces]{.underline} in several allied states.¶ This has translated into
a clash between liberal and illiberal interpretations of the¶ Western
security community, which has the potential to seriously complicate
interallied¶ relations in the foreseeable future. As this paper shows,
contrary to conventional¶ wisdom, middle powers have always played
important roles in the constitution¶ of the Western security community.
More recently, they have also played significant¶ roles in contesting
liberal interpretations of the security community, and articulating¶ an
alternative, radical conservative vision of the West. Recent
developments in allied¶ countries such as Turkey and Poland are a potent
reminder that not all middle¶ powers are alike; on the contrary, based
on their socially constructed, historically¶ specific definitions of
identity, they can perform a diversity of international roles---in¶
support of, or, conversely, as obstacles to liberal internationalism.¶
[One of the most influential narratives of international
security]{.underline} put forward by¶ liberal IR scholars and
practitioners [centres on the Euro-Atlantic security]{.underline}
[community]{.underline},¶ [consisting of a group of countries united
around a set of key liberal norms and]{.underline}¶ [institutions that
generate ''dependable expectations'' of peaceful resolution of
conflicts]{.underline}¶ that might arise among them.1 From that
perspective, NATO is an institution that was created in the context of
the Cold War to protect the pre-existing security¶ community from the
threats posed by the West's dangerous other: the communist¶ bloc.
[Yet]{.underline}, as a series of constructivist scholars have
persuasively argued, [there is]{.underline}¶ [nothing natural about the
Western security community]{.underline}.2 In Emanuel Adler's¶ words,
''[security communities are socially constructed]{.underline} and rest
on shared practical¶ knowledge of the peaceful resolution of
conflicts.''3 Furthermore, [the absence of]{.underline}¶ [violence
should not lead us to conclude that the construction of security
communities]{.underline}¶ in general and the Western community in
particular [were power-free processes]{.underline}.¶ On the contrary, as
Adler and Barnett explain, [central to the establishment]{.underline}¶
[of a security community is the dialectic between
power]{.underline}---primarily symbolic¶ power---[and
knowledge]{.underline}.4 Thus, in [the physically non-violent context of
security]{.underline}¶ [communities, power is primarily ''the authority
to determine the shared meanings]{.underline}¶ [that embody
the]{.underline} [identities]{.underline}, interests and practices [of
states,]{.underline} as well as the conditions¶ that confer, defer or
deny access to goods and benefits.''5 [Applying this logic to
the]{.underline}¶ [specific case of NATO, we can see the alliance not as
the institutional expression of]{.underline}¶ [a pre-given community,
but]{.underline}, rather, [as an organization that has been
deeply]{.underline}¶ [involved in power-filled practices of
construction]{.underline} and reproduction [of that]{.underline}¶
[community]{.underline}.6¶ Historical evidence indicates that [the
founders of NATO---policymaking elites]{.underline}¶ from the United
Kingdom, Canada, the United States, France, and the Benelux¶
states---[did not take the Western security community for
granted]{.underline}. Instead, [they]{.underline}¶ [engaged in a
systematic set of practices aimed at constructing a sense of
community]{.underline}¶ [around a shared set of liberal-democratic norms
in the Euro-Atlantic area]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}¶
[placed]{.underline} the newly created [N]{.underline}orth
[A]{.underline}tlantic [T]{.underline}reaty [O]{.underline}rganization
[at the heart of those]{.underline}¶ [practices.]{.underline} In the
intergovernmental debates leading up to the establishment of¶ NATO, the
threat of military confrontation with the Soviet Union was regarded¶ as
less worrisome than the danger of communist subversion within the
weakened¶ societies of Western European states.7 In that context, as
Louis St. Laurent---then¶ Canadian Secretary of State for External
Affairs---argued, the best way to prevent¶ a third world war was by
confronting ''the forces of communist expansion with an overwhelming
preponderance of moral, economic and military force on the side of¶
freedom.''8¶ [At the level of top Western political elites, the fear of
communism inspired a]{.underline}¶ [collective (re)definition of
political identity in the Euro-Atlantic area. The
''spectre]{.underline}¶ [of Communism'' provided the defining other
against which decision-makers on]{.underline}¶ [both sides of the
Atlantic were able to subordinate their differences]{.underline} to a
collective¶ definition of a Western community. That community was seen
as based on the¶ common heritage of political and cultural ideas of
member states; [its defining mark]{.underline}¶ [was the set of shared
values of individual liberal freedoms]{.underline}, the rule of law,
[and]{.underline}¶ [democracy]{.underline}.9 This view is clearly
reflected in the preamble to the Washington Treaty¶ (NATO's foundational
treaty), which stipulates that the alliance is based on principles¶ of
democracy, individual liberty, and law.

### Problem-Solution 

#### Arms control is integrally linked to the military industrial complex through its promotion of sovereign rule in its ability to manage force. Reject the aff's problem solving methodology that justifies technomanagerial logic and the acceptability of war. 

**Krause 11** (Keith Krause (2011) Leashing the Dogs of War: Arms
Control from Sovereignty to Governmentality\*, Contemporary Security
Policy, 32:1, 20-39, DOI: 10.1080/13523260.2011.556823,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2011.556823>) NL

\*This is probably my best card in terms of 1nc links as it has a lot of
warrants, including the framing the aff embraces.

So what remains is a set of formal arms control agreements, mostly
bilateral, but also a few that were multilateral, designed to manage the
potentially most dangerous and destabilizing aspects of inter-state
conflict dynamics. [They channeled the confrontation between the
superpowers into a technical and problem-solving logic that would
facilitate decision making about what kinds of weapons to produce and
deploy, and under what circumstances to use them.]{.underline} In
addition, after some of the conceptual confusions of early nuclear
strategy (such as Massive Retaliation), [arms control became part of the
logic by which decisions over appropriate (rational) strategies could be
designe]{.underline}d. In the 1960s and 1970s, in context of the
East-West conflict and nuclear proliferation, maintaining the conditions
of stable deterrence and reducing the risk of war was perhaps a
politically and normatively laudable goal. [But arms control was thus
also linked to deterrence theory and practice, and to the entire
functioning of the so-called military-industrial complex, and not
something distinct and in opposition to it]{.underline}. This vision
would not necessarily be accepted by those -- such as researchers at the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and other
think-tanks -- who saw themselves as growing out of the peace and
anti-nuclear weapons movements, but I ARMS CONTROL FROM SOVEREIGNTY TO
GOVERNMENTALITY 25 think the policy acceptability of SIPRI's work (for
example) came precisely from its progressive acceptance of the
underlying rules of the game.19 What were these rules of the game? There
are four elements of the Cold War practice of arms control that warrant
a deeper exploration in order to illustrate the normalizing and
sovereign logic of arms control. [The first element was the attempt by
proponents of arms control to distinguish it from advocacy of
disarmament in any form. Disarmament was associated with the failed
attempts to negotiate reductions in armaments during the interwar
period. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was associated with the peace and
anti-nuclear movements, and was seen as the preserve of impractical
idealist efforts -- at best politically naı¨ve; at worst politically
suspect]{.underline}. As Jeffrey Larsen notes, 'in the early 1960s
international security specialists began using the term arms control in
place of the term disarmament, which they believed lacked precision and
smacked of utopianism. The seminal books on arms control published in
that era all referred to this semantic problem'.20 [So arms control was
presented by its practitioners as directed towards controlling or
regulating the numbers, types, deployment or use of certain types or
quantities of arms, and disarmament was defined as involving the
reduction or the elimination of particular weapons and weapons systems,
and/or foreswearing of acquisition of new weapons]{.underline}.21
Although occasionally agreements were signed that did eliminate weapons
systems or particular classes of weapons, most notably the 1987
Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty that eliminated an entire class
of nuclear weapons, when seen as part of the broader spectrum of nuclear
capabilities, such [restrictions were tilted more towards the control
side of the equation]{.underline}.[22 Overall, arms control reinforced,
not undermined, sovereign state power. The second, related, element was
the technocratic or problem-solving orientation of arms control
practices. Its political acceptability came from its claim to operate
within the same policy frame as other forms of military-strategic
thinking, including of course deterrence theory and strategy,
alliance-building, and the entire militaryindustrial logic that shaped
Western (and arguably Eastern) security policy. More importantly,
however, it provided legitimacy to a counter-intuitive set of policy
prescriptions (such as leaving your own civilian population vulnerable
to nuclear attack, or revealing the equivalent of state secrets as part
of confidence-building measures).]{.underline} And finally, the
technocratic approach also was, in its strongest version, opposed to the
irrational and uncontrollable prescriptions of what, as early as
President Eisenhower, was called the military-industrial complex. High
level proponents of arms control (Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara,
for example, as well perhaps as Secretary of State Henry Kissinger),
regarded the defence establishment as unable to set limits on its threat
assessment and concomitant arms acquisitions. [They wished to subject
security policy to rational managerial techniques, including such ideas
as diminishing marginal returns to investments in new weapons,
cost-benefit analysis for weapons systems, and trade offs between
competing goals (the guns-versus-butter debate]{.underline}).23 As Henry
Kissinger is once purported to have said, 'What in the name of God is
strategic superiority? What is the significance of it, politically,
militarily, operationally, at these levels of numbers? What do you do
with it?' thus expressing his frustration with the inability of the
nuclear defense establishment to provide a rationale for its weapons
acquisition plans.24 [Even more]{.underline} 26 CONTEMPORARY SECURITY
POLICY [hawkish arms controllers subscribed to the rational calculus,
with, for example, Paul Nitze arguing, with respect to ballistic missile
defense (Star Wars), that it had to be cost effective on the margin in
order to make strategic sense.25 Arms control was thus more rational --
and promised to achieve the same national security goals (including
war-fighting dominance) at lower cost]{.underline}. But the actual
achievements of arms control negotiations, treaties and agreements are
difficult to assess, even if we use some counter-factual analysis. As
noted above, [arms control failed to stem the technological arms race,
failed to reduce spending on weapons, and perhaps played only a marginal
role in preventing a violent superpower confrontation. In all of its
forms, arms control was not a transformative paradigm -- but a
technomanagerial project.]{.underline} The transformation of inter-state
relations via either nuclear disarmament or nuclear holocaust was to be
avoided at all costs, [and the management of the superpower arms race
was a sort of via media between these two Manichean
visions.]{.underline} Parenthetically, some prominent advocates, such as
Robert McNamara, or President Barack Obama, who have argued prominently
for the complete abolition of nuclear weapons, claim implicitly or
explicitly that there is a seamless conceptual thread that goes from
arms control to nuclear disarmament, and that all that distinguishes one
from the other is the relative time horizon or degree of pragmatism of
the advocates.26 But this is both conceptually and practically unlikely
-- [if arms control is a set of techno-managerial practices fully
integrated into the Cold War logic of national security strategy, then
it is unable to make the leap to disarmament -- which involves an
entirely different idea about the place of violence in social and
political life]{.underline}. Recent debates around the ratification of
the New START treaty in late 2010 illustrated how it hardly represented
a step towards deeper nuclear reductions. The third core element of the
arms control paradigm was that the [Weberian state's monopoly over the
use of lethal force could not only be used to impose order domestically
and to create social peace but that it could also be projected outwards
to create a form of international order that reduced the risk of
violence. Just as the domestic form of the Weberian monopoly renders the
population vulnerable to the predatory state]{.underline} (so much so
that scholars such as Rudolph Rummel could argue that democide --
state-sanctioned killing of citizens -- was a greater risk than war);27
the international form also involved rendering entire populations
totally vulnerable to nuclear holocaust. In the name of national
security the very survival of the entire population could be put at
risk, through policies such as Mutual Assured Destruction or treaties
such as the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty[. It is difficult to
find a better example of techno-managerial logic, instrumental
rationality and the assertion of sovereign power at work. Although
perhaps an extreme example, this faith in the ability of states to
exercise restraint over the use of force, also underlay the entire
edifice of nuclear deterrence policy and strategy.]{.underline} The
final element was that [the arms control paradigm, like the much older
balance of power system, was not a mechanism for maintaining order that
eliminated war or the use of force from the international system. It
assumed that the main risk to be prevented was that of large-scale
inter-state war between great powers or the superpowers, and that a
trade-off between this risk, and the risk of (or fact of) small and
large wars, especially in the postcolonial world, was an acceptable
one.]{.underline} [The use of]{.underline} ARMS CONTROL FROM SOVEREIGNTY
TO GOVERNMENTALITY 27 [violence was either to be part of the logic of
so-called limited (nuclear) war or to be confined to the periphery, to
such places as Indochina, Angola, and Afghanistan]{.underline} (although
this was hardly peripheral to the Soviet Union). [This was analogous to
the operation of the 19th century balance of power system, which
sanctioned the partitions of Poland, the Crimean War, and so forth in
the name of maintaining systemic stability. Similarly, the logic of
limited nuclear war, as presented by scholars such as Henry Kissinger,
rested upon the assumption that the use of force could be carefully
calibrated and controlled.28 The neo-colonialist and political
implications of pushing the problem of war to the periphery are of
course clear, and one could argue that the arms control paradigm
sketched above]{.underline}, especially the treaties that stabilized the
nuclear confrontation between East and West (SALT I and II), [made
certain kinds of proxy wars more possible or acceptable by creating
escalatory fire-breaks that facilitated the relatively risk-free
provision of military assistance to client states and movements. These
fire breaks were easier to create in the global South, where American
and Russian troops managed to avoid confronting each other directly, but
less easy to create in Europe.]{.underline} The history of attempts to
achieve mutual and balanced force reductions (the 1975 name for what in
the late 1980s became the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE Treaty),
and of debates over the necessity for intermediate range and tactical
nuclear weapons in Europe, and the problem of extended deterrence (or
the nuclear umbrella) all point towards a set of tensions or
contradictions within the logic of arms control. It is not the place of
this article to demonstrate in detail how these four understandings or
elements of the arms control paradigm were instantiated in particular
Cold War arms control practices (treaties and negotiations). [It is
reasonably clear, however, that such things as the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty (NPT), which enshrined the nuclear supremacy of
the permanent five members of the UN Security Council, or the logic of
the nuclear strategy of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD), or the NATO
doctrine of first use of nuclear weapons, or the lack of any meaningful
restraint on technological innovation for nuclear weapons and delivery
systems, rested upon a deep faith in the ability of the Weberian state
to regulate and control the use of violence]{.underline}. [Some scholars
and analysts went so far as to argue that the possession of nuclear
weapons imposed -- as a sort of structural constraint -- a strong form
of rationality on state behaviour.29 Arms control efforts were simply
one part of this larger logic, and in any event were not designed to
threaten or undermine it. They were, in short, a clear expression of a
Foucauldian form of sovereign rule that reinforced the system of rule of
the contemporary state system.]{.underline}

### Russia Threat

#### The Russian threat paradigm is grounded in [racial]{.underline} and [ideological]{.underline} dogma that works to maintain the [imperial nature]{.underline} of western power -- their descriptions aren't [neutral]{.underline}, but a [byproduct]{.underline} of underlying militaristic epistemology 

**Brown 10** \[Prof @ University of Aberdeen James, "A Stereotype,
Wrapped in a Cliché, Inside a Caricature: Russian Foreign Policy and
Orientalism," POLITICS: 2010 VOL 30(3), 149--159\]

[As a]{.underline} natural [consequence of the lack of real knowledge
about the area, the '"East]{.underline}" **[has always signified danger
and threat']{.underline}** (ibid., p. 26). [It represents an 'otherwise
silent and dangerous space beyond familiar boundaries']{.underline}
(ibid., p. 57) [that the West must confront **forcefully**]{.underline}.
Moreover this sense of fear is not restricted to the past: Today,
bookstores in the US are filled with shabby screeds bearing screaming
headlines about Islam and terror, Islam exposed, the Arab threat and the
Muslim menace, all of them written by political polemicists pretending
to knowledge imparted to them and others by experts who have supposedly
penetrated to the heart of these strange Oriental peoples over there
(ibid., p. xv). [This portrayal of the East as an enigmatic and
dangerous counterpoint is a **fundamental** **component** of Orientalist
literature]{.underline}. However, as well as exaggerating the East's
distinctiveness, [the Orientalist canon is committed to **proclaiming
its inferiority.**]{.underline} The second core characteristic of
Orientalist literature is its portrayal of the region as a degenerate
divergence from Western norms. Specifically, the people are presented as
backward or, as Chaim Weizmann put it to Arthur Balfour, 'the fellah is
at least four centuries behind the times' (quoted in ibid., p. 306).
What is more, [unlike superior Europeans, **\[they\]**]{.underline}
Orientals [are prone to irrationality, inefficiency, inability to learn
from mistakes and a chronic incapacity for self-government]{.underline}
(ibid., pp. 36--40, 107, 228, 241). In dealing with them, one must
appreciate that 'power is the only language they understand' (ibid., p.
xv). Furthermore, [not content with highlighting this supposed
inferiority, Orientalism is committed to **rectifying it.**]{.underline}
The East must therefore be kept 'in statu pupillari' (ibid., p. 37)
while the West imposes its more advanced socio-political model upon it.
[The knowledge produced by Orientalism is therefore 'never raw,
unmediated, or simply objective']{.underline} (ibid., p. 273) [but
**complicit** in a political project with **imperialist
instincts.**]{.underline} For this reason, Said brands Orientalism a
trahison des clercs (ibid., p. xxi), suggesting that, even though their
participation may be unconscious[, 'the Orientalist could be regarded as
**the special agent of Western power'**]{.underline} (ibid., p. 223).
Having said this, recognition of Orientalism's close connections to
power is not to imply that its analysis is compelling. The third
prominent feature of Orientalist discourse is its 'paper-thin
intellectual apparatus' (ibid., p. 322). Said explains that over time
Western writing about the Orient has acquired a narrow set of
convictions which now serve as the foundation of all subsequent
thinking. Analyses of the region proceed from the basis of this received
knowledge and are consequently repetitive and unimaginative. [Their
purpose is no longer to engage with their subject directly or achieve
fresh insight, but to reiterate and reconfirm '**unshakeable abstract
maxims about the "civilization"'**]{.underline} (ibid., p. 52). Every
fact is taken to be a reaffirmation of established principles and all
phenomena are explained via reduction to the same tired models. This
problem is exacerbated by the tendency for Area Studies to be closed off
from other disciplines (ibid., p. 70). Some of the specific traits of
this orthodoxy are as follows: First is 'demeaning generalization'
(ibid., p. xiii), whereby 'innumerable histories and a dizzying variety
of peoples, languages, experiences and cultures, all these are swept
aside or ignored' (ibid., p. xiv). Second is eternality: the Orient is
deemed never to change and there is therefore no need to alter one's
intellectual models. Momentous shifts are downplayed and previously
unseen phenomena are confi- dently labelled atavism (ibid., pp. 58, 104,
240). Third, [Orientalism uses **crude one-dimensional models** upon
which scholars would not countenance relying if their object of study
was the West]{.underline}. Prominent examples include a fixation with
geographical determinism (ibid., pp. 162, 216) and obsession with the
'Oriental personality' (ibid., p. 31). Fourth, Orientalists have a great
talent for combining 'imperial vagueness and precise detail' (ibid., p.
50). Therefore, while indulging in the most shameless of
generalisations, Orientalists simultaneously bombard the reader with
'sheer, overpowering, monumental description' (ibid., p. 162). Fifth,
despite pretensions to expertise, numerous Orientalists are remarkably
underqualified to speak about the East and cannot even claim knowledge
of the relevant languages (ibid., pp. 178, 193). In developing the
argument outlined above, Said refers almost exclusively to
representations of the Arab world. However, as an intellectual model,
Orientalism lends itself to application well beyond its original field
of study as a means of drawing attention to any area of scholarship in
which the literature has become stuck in a monotonous cycle of
reaffirmation. With this in mind, this article employs Orientalism to
critique Western discourse on Russian foreign policy. Orientalism and
Russian foreign policy Orientalism and Russia are not unacquainted. In
fact, Russia (or the Soviet Union) features more than ten times in
Orientalism. There is also a substantial secondary literature that
explores Orientalism in the Russian context (e.g. Bolton, 2009;
David-Fox, Holquist and Martin, 2006; Khalid, 2000). However, for both
Said and the vast majority of subsequent scholars, Russia is
significant, not as an object of Orientalist modes of thought, but as an
origin. In particular, [the literature highlights Russia's long imperial
history,]{.underline} [its tendency to define its core culture in
contradis-tinction to those of the Caucasus and Central Asia, and its
imposition of a standardised way of life upon]{.underline} the peoples
of its empire. [However, just because a culture is itself an instigator
of Orientalism]{.underline} **[does not mean that it is not also a
recipient]{.underline}**. This fact has been recognised by Iver Neumann.
In Uses of the Other, [Neumann describes the historical construction of
Russia as Europe's Other.]{.underline} In particular, he draws attention
to representations of the country as a 'barbarian at the gate' (Neumann,
1999, p. 77), acknowledges the popular stereotype of 'an alleged Russian
Volksgeist ("national character") of sloth, drunkenness, and laziness'
(ibid., p. 104) and highlights the perception of Russia as 'a gigantic
specimen to which the most advanced legal and administrative ideas could
be applied with a completeness impossible in western Europe' (Anderson,
quoted in ibid., p. 78). In making this case, Neumann cites Said and
clearly demonstrates the appropriateness of his model to this context.
However, Russia is not the exclusive focus of his book and, even when
dealing with the subject, Neumann's concern is with long-standing
cultural representations of the country and not contemporary portrayals
of its position in international politics. Elsewhere, some scholars have
explored specific deficiencies in the Western political discourse about
Russia (Gleason, 1951; Lieven, 2000; Malia, 1999; Mikoyan, 2006;
Solzhenitsyn, 1980); most recently, [studies have highlighted
anti-Russian sentiment among US policymakers]{.underline} (Tsygankov,
2009) and [lack of balance in Western media coverage of the 2008
Russo--Georgian war]{.underline} (English and Svyatets, 2010). And yet,
as valuable as these contributions are, [they tend to frame their
arguments in terms of **Russophobia**]{.underline} and do not recognise
the interdisciplinary relevance of Orientalism. This article fills the
gap in this literature by demonstrating how Said's model can be employed
to make sense of the clichés, distortions and exaggerations that taint
this discourse. The use of this alternative framework is a valuable
addition, not only because it highlights some heretofore un-noted
deficiencies, but also because it does so by drawing upon a more
substantive and deep-rooted theory than the nebulous Russophobia. As
such, rather than simply describing the weaknesses, the Orientalist
model is able to employ its sophisticated understanding of the process
of Othering to offer a clear and credible account of their emergence.
Moreover, Said's depiction of how [the discourse about a region can come
to be dominated by a **partisan** and **self-perpetuating** orthodoxy
provides a valuable explanation for the **pervasiveness** and
**durability** of the **unfortunate representation** of **Russian
foreign policy**]{.underline} that is detailed here. Each of these
considerations provides significant scope for further research, thus
encouraging the opening up of this subject area to much-needed
intellectual rejuvenation. At this point I should make clear that it is
not my intention to suggest that all Western accounts of Russian foreign
policy are Orientalist; there are many fine studies that do not fit the
model. However, as the following paragraphs reveal, there is a sizeable
mass of literature that unmistakably displays the characteristic
symptoms of Orientalism. With regard to the first trait -- the
exaggeration of difference -- [there is a striking propensity to portray
Russian foreign policy as **markedly different** from that of Western
states.]{.underline} Although probably of older origin, [this perception
was powerfully reinforced by the stark dividing lines of the Cold War
and by Moscow's use of ideological rhetoric to justify its international
strategy]{.underline}. Despite the collapse of communism, [this image of
Russia as an Other]{.underline}, which pursues a qualitatively different
mode of behaviour, [remains prominent]{.underline} **[in Western
scholarship]{.underline}**. It might be noted that all branches of Area
Studies are prone to stress countries' dissimilarities, while
downplaying their commonalities, since this represents much of the
field's unique selling point. However, be this as it may, there is
certainly a tendency for Russia's mode of engagement in international
affairs to be presented as unusual. To be specific,
[scholars]{.underline} regularly [present Russian foreign policy as
**puzzling**, **unpredictable**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[divergent from the Western norm.]{.underline}** Indeed, the country's
behaviour is considered to be so exceptional and difficult to define
that standard analytical models are not thought to apply (Arias-King,
King de Arias and Arias de la Canal, 2008; Kubicek, 1999, pp. 547--548;
Legvold, 2007a, pp. 10--11). Bobo Lo, one of the best-known Western
experts on the subject, clearly highlights this conception, beginning
his popular textbook with the observation that Russia's external
activities reflect 'the perversity of human nature' and, 'far from
exhibiting an underlying if specific pragmatism \... have been liberally
streaked with irrationality' (Lo, 2002, p. 1). Moreover, in accordance
with the Orientalist model, this image of inscrutable foreignness is
persistently reaffirmed through shared language use. Most notable in
this regard is the literature's compulsive repetition of Churchill's
claim that Russia's actions are a 'riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside
an enigma' (Arias-King, King de Arias and Arias de la Canal, 2008, p.
118; Donaldson and Nogee, 2009, p. 65; Joyce, 1984, p. 134; Lo, 2002, p.
1; March, 2006, p. 88; Rubinstein, 1989, p. 12). Another popular means
of expressing the same idea is the medical metaphor, whereby Russia is
presented as 'genetically different' (Wesson, 1974, p. 3), exhibiting
allergic reactions (Lo, 2008, p. 258) and afflicted by various ailments,
including Borderline Personality Disorder (Arias-King, King de Arias and
Arias de la Canal, 2008). Meanwhile, others contribute to this sense of
exoticism, deviance and distance via clichés about bears (Garnett, 1997,
p. 61; Menon, 1995), chess (Goldman, 2008, pp. 92, 154--155) and nesting
dolls (Legvold, 2009, pp. 42--43). Furthermore, as Said predicts, as
well as being presented as somehow more extraordinary and
incomprehensible than the behaviour of any other large, complex state,
Russian foreign policy is portrayed as significantly more dangerous.
[Despite its **'syndrome of backwardness'**]{.underline} (Snyder, 1994,
p. 181), [Russia continues to represent **a serious potential threat**
to international stability]{.underline} (Kubicek, 1999, pp. 567--568;
Pipes, 1997; Snyder, 1994, p. 197) **[and is thus a popular subject for
Western polemic]{.underline}** (Baker and Glasser, 2005; Lucas, 2008).
[Turning to the second tenet of Orientalism]{.underline} -- [the
assumption of Western superiority]{.underline} -- [there is]{.underline}
also **[clear evidence]{.underline}** [that Russia's mode of engagement
in international politics is]{.underline} routinely
**[presented]{.underline}** [as inferior to that of Western
countries]{.underline}. In a manner that contributes to the image of
Russian deviationism (though contradicts the illusion of mysterious
unpredictability), [a substantial values gap is proposed to exist
between **Russian** and **Western strategic cultures**]{.underline}
(Forsberg, 2004, pp. 261--263; Mankoff, 2010, p. 134; March, 2006, p.
93). In essence, [while the West is considered to have largely
transcended Hobbesian modes of thought,]{.underline} **[Russian foreign
policy remains 'nakedly realist']{.underline}** (March, 2006, p. 92),
[fixated with]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}**,
**[sovereignty]{.underline}** [and the]{.underline} **[pursuit of
national interest]{.underline}**. This is an entirely legitimate
observation, yet what is dubious is the disparaging suggestion that this
approach is un-European (ibid., p. 93), anachronistic (Lo, 2008, p. 176)
or even so backward as to be rooted in a different historical era
(Vihavainen, 2009, pp. 53--54). What is more, not only is Russia's
strategy deemed outdated, but [its attempts to implement it are also
seen as substandard since its policymaking is habitually **cast as
chaotic**]{.underline}, **[error prone]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
even **[feckless]{.underline}** (Garnett, 1998, pp. 67--70; Legvold,
2007a, pp. 7--10; Lo, 2008, p. 141; Simes, 2007, p. 36). Again, there
may be some truth to this, especially with regard to the early 1990s,
yet so embedded has this image become that even successful (from the
Russian perspective) undertakings -- such as the use of energy as a
means of economic and political leverage, and military intervention in
Georgia -- are instinctively portrayed as fundamental failures (Baev,
2008, pp. 128--129; Sestanovich, 2008, pp. 25--26; Vendil Pallin and
Westerlund, 2009). Furthermore, as the Orientalist model suggests, as
well as being convinced of the waywardness of Russia's approach, Western
scholars are committed to rectifying it. The issue of how its pupil was
'lost' in the 1990s continues to be debated (Columbus, 2001; Eyal, 2009;
Simes, 2007), thus assuming that Russia was ever someone's to lose, and
[academics presumptuously dictate how the country can be returned to the
'right' path]{.underline} (Council on Foreign Relations, 2006). While
nominally independent, **[such scholarship clearly shares and serves the
interests of Western power.]{.underline}** Finally, traces of
Orientalism are detectable in the intellectual models employed in the
study of this subject. Although the number of publications in this area
is large, accounts of Russian foreign policy, when not essentially
heavyweight descriptions (e.g. Donaldson and Nogee, 2009; Kennedy-Pipe,
1998; Rangsimaporn, 2009), are remarkably repetitive and unimaginative.
Testimony to this fact is provided by the surprising number of
similarities to be found in the analyses, if not the ultimate
expectations, of liberal (e.g. Legvold, 2007b) and conservative (e.g.
Pipes, 1996) commentators. Rather than undertaking innovative research
into how findings from other disciplines can be applied to this context
or drawing new cross-national comparisons, scholars habitually reiterate
a core set of convictions which, on the basis of use rather than truth,
has become the standard narrative. Employing simplifications and
unsubstantiated claims that would not be tolerated with regard to
Western states, this basic approach does little to enhance our
understanding of Russian foreign policy. At core, [the **orthodox
discourse** takes the view that there is a specifically **Russian
mindset** or **pattern of behaviour** to which the country **inevitably
reverts**]{.underline}. [While Western states are assumed to respond
**rationally** to incentives and constraints]{.underline}, [Russian
policy is guided by some **primordial instinct** that has been indelibly
imprinted upon its national character by the weight of **geography** and
**history**. This predisposition naturally inclines the country towards
**expansionism**, **militarism** and **autocracy**]{.underline}
(Brzezinski, 1984; Galeotti, 1995, pp. 3--24; Lo, 2003, pp. 72--83;
Pipes, 1996; Snyder, 1994, p. 179). Moreover, so enduring is this
assumed inclination that it is deemed to apply across the fault lines of
Russian and Soviet history. [In consequence, there is an uncommon
tendency to explain Russia's current foreign policy by drawing upon
historical precedent]{.underline} (Bunce, 1993; Joyce, 1984; Lederer,
1962; Legvold, 2007b and 2009; Lo, 2008, pp. 17--37; Vihavainen, 2009).
For example, [Russia is said still to possess a **collective 'Mongol
complex'**]{.underline} as the result of the subjugation of Russian
lands from the 13th to 15th centuries (Lo, 2008, pp. 18--19; Vihavainen,
2009). This phenomenon apparently helps account for today's ambivalent
national identity and troubled relations with both East and West. In
explaining why no respected scholar would account for modern British
policies in such a way, Timo Vihavainen states bluntly that 'England had
changed, while Russia had not' (2009, pp. 18--19). [Encouraged by this
view that Russia is trapped in the past, all manner of modern phenomena
are labelled **atavism**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [**dubious
parallels** are drawn between **modern** and **historical
figures**,]{.underline} such as between Vladimir Putin and Peter the
Great, Stolypin and Stalin (Lo, 2003, pp. 6, 133--134; McDonald, 2007,
pp. 182--183; Murawiec, 2000). Of course, there is nothing wrong with
historical comparison per se; it is a widely used and valuable
analytical technique. However it should be employed when genuinely
merited and not simply as a matter of convention.

### Russia Predictions -- think tanks

#### Their use of think tanks as a way of predicting Russian behavior guarantees error replication 

**Crosston 15** (Matthew, Professor of Political Science at Bellevue
University, "NEMESIS: Keeping Russia an Enemy through Cold War
Pathologies", Forthcoming in Сравнительная Политика, No. 3 (19), 2015,
МГИМО (Московский Государственный Институт Международного Отношения),
Moscow, Russian Federation, pgs. 3-8, \[SG\])

[There are numerous think tanks]{.underline}, both in the United States
and Russia, [which are deeply concerned about the state of
Russian-American relations]{.underline}. Places like the Moscow Carnegie
Centre or [the Brookings Institute in Washington DC are regular go-to
places for the media when seeking expert opinion and analysis. However,
these centers have had a decided slant in allocating blame for the poor
bilateral relations to the Russians, with the explanations ranging from
the fairly simple to the rather mystically esoteric.]{.underline} "If
America did not exist, Russia would have to invent it. In a sense it
already has: first as a dream, then as a nightmare. No other country
looms so large in the Russian psyche. To Kremlin ideologists, the very
concept of Russia's sovereignty depends on being free of America's
influence. Anti-Americanism has long been a staple of Vladimir Putin,
but it has undergone an important shift. Gone are the days when the
Kremlin craved recognition and lashed out at the West for not
recognizing Russia as one of its own. Now it neither pretends nor
aspires to be like the West. Instead, it wants to exorcise all traces of
American influence."2 [It is not difficult to find this Freudian popcorn
political psychology today when it comes to 'analyzing' Russian
positions. It portrays the United States as the victim of a global
oedipal complex when it comes to Russia: first Putin desperately craves
daddy's attention only to then defiantly and recklessly reject him,
petulantly trying to run away from home.]{.underline} It is important to
remark how most countries around the world would actually find it
dangerously myopic and unhealthy to base its own foreign policy on
earning the 'approval' of another country. With ease the far more
standard approach to foreign policy formulation is to determine a
country's own national interests within its local security dilemma and
craft an independent and fierce strategy that can best achieve its
optimal goals. That normal process, ironically, is often described in
America as a 'shift' away from craving attention to exorcising American
demons. In reality there is no shift: Russia has always been about
Russia, as it expects America to be about America, France to be about
France, Nigeria to be about Nigeria, so forth and so on. [What Russia
usually finds so irksome is that when it does what everyone else does in
terms of exercising global power, it is judged as psychologically
unstable or deficient. What the American media outlets and think tank
personalities fail to recognize is how much of this judgment is coming
not from explicitly observable behavior or direct quotes from Russian
actors but is placed upon Russia by the so called experts themselves as
they push a decidedly one-sided interpretation.]{.underline} Russia is
not supposed to aspire to be a copy of the West nor should it be
allowing particular American influence over its policies. This is not
said as anti-Americanism but rather as simple logic: America would never
strive to copy another country and it most certainly would not allow
another country to force-influence its foreign policy. So why should
Russia? It is this very simple and straightforward question that seems
to never be asked by what are otherwise august media institutions and
impressive political think tanks in the West. Sometimes this tendency
can reach near farcical levels. When Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the
Russian parliament's foreign-relations committee, received so much media
attention here when he spoke about ridding Russia of dependence on
America and even fining cinemas that showed too many foreign films,
Western experts needed to recognize the absurd for absurdity. But they
did not. Failure to do so is perplexing given Western analysis always
laments the strengthening of Putin's own presidential power system and
decries how little power sits within the legislative or judiciary
branches of Russian government. Thus, it is nonsensical to highlight
parliamentarians as having real impact. But this happens often in
America with no sense of diplomatic irony. There also tends to be a
failure to focus Russian analysis through the looking glass of
reciprocity. What this means is that [current American thinking
emphasizes how untrustworthy Moscow decision-makers are while completely
ignoring the same Russian criticism lobbed back at
Washington.]{.underline} President Putin openly and publicly discusses
his lack of trust in American power and in the specific policy decisions
emanating from the White House. It is this skepticism that supposedly
forces his own lack of desire to engage the United States. There are
simply too few voices at present in the West trying to analyze this
mindset as a legitimate position. As far as can be determined, the only
reason this is not analyzed more seriously is because the competing
alternative -- that Putin is untrustworthy and Moscow is the cause of
all communication breakdown -- is simply accepted as a de facto axiom.
[In short, if the United States does not trust Russia, it is because of
how Russia behaves on the global stage and its untrustworthy history. If
Russia does not trust the United States, that is simply Russian
posturing and a case of political transference, wanting to blame its own
selfmade problems on someone else so that it can avoid any
accountability. The problem is how readily this is unquestioningly
accepted]{.underline} and how few so-called Russian experts are willing
to step forward and shine a light on such intellectual superficiality.
[Perhaps one of the worst examples of this is the over-reliance on
'insider knowledge' without actually vetting the source's
objectivity.]{.underline} The recent exit of Alexander Sytnik as a
senior fellow from the Russian Institute for Strategic Research is a
prime example. Upon his exit early in 2015, Reshetnikov unleashed a
torrent of information that, while interesting, really does not amount
to more than just gossip and hearsay. Worse, American media and
political analysts adopted it almost wholly as fact rather than as a
possibly compromised source motivated to talk badly about Russia: "The
Russian analyst's scathing remarks about the country's leadership and
about the community of government experts confirm that the concept of
Russian supremacy has a strong hold on the Russian leadership. These
supremacist views are not limited to the post-Soviet space, where 'only
ethnic Russians are capable of creating statehood.' The West is also
seen as decadent and somewhat spiritually inferior to the Russians. The
spread of such views in Russia, especially among the country's leaders,
precludes easy and quick solutions to the Ukrainian crisis, but rather
suggests a relatively lengthy period of tensions between Russia and the
West, even if Russian strongman Vladimir Putin were, for some reason, to
step down."3 (Italics mine) [The tendency is to use personal opinion as
confirmation of fact when it should be recognized as biased material.
The only confirmation is the affirming of preconceived ideas and a
particular agenda that undermines any new attitudinal environment
between Russia and the United States. As a consequence, it is easy to
find 'research' proclaiming Russian goals that have never been publicly
disclosed or addressing Putin objectives that have never been formally
issued. This is not to say that Russia is incapable of having ulterior
motives or secret agendas.]{.underline} Truly every country to one
degree or another has them. The criticism here is the propensity in the
Russian analytical sphere to assume such agendas and then cherry picking
information to affirm the assumption. In [pure methodological terms,
selection bias is rife within the community that analyzes Russia,
leaving those analyses decidedly weak. This bias is only more pronounced
when you leave academically-oriented think tanks/news monitors behind
and observe within the corridors of American power]{.underline}.
Traditionally, the focus has been on a decidedly anti-Russian fervor
coming from the Republican Party. However, this analysis would argue
that except for a very brief and ultimately dashed Obama 'reset,'
Russian-American relations within Washington DC has always been
dominated in both parties by a remarkably typical Republican mindset.
[That mindset sets a fairly stark characterization: Russia is an
aggressive and untrustworthy dictatorship that is an innate
contradiction to American values. As such it will inevitably always be a
threat to U.S. interests and global security]{.underline}. 4 By all
indicators, Russia is a threat not just to itself and its immediate
neighbors but to the entire world, masking its own domestic failings and
instabilities with an aggressive foreign policy that will never
acquiesce to a more peaceful and cooperative global community.5 [Indeed,
in an American political world that likes to specialize in ambiguous
statements and plausible deniability, it is rather remarkable how freely
the American Congress seems to deride Russia: John Boehner: "It is
increasingly evident that Russia is intent on expanding its boundaries
and power through hostile acts." Ted Poe: "The Russian bear is coming
out of its cave because it got its feelings hurt because of the fall of
the Soviet Union, and now it is trying to regain its
territories."]{.underline} Chris Smith: accused a "repressive Russian
regime" of "coddling dictators" around the globe from Central Asia to
Syria to Cuba and Venezuela. Trent Franks: After the conclusion of an
arms deal between Russia and Venezuela, President Putin was called a
"thugocrat" engaged in "dangerous alliances."6 [Keep in mind all of the
above statements were uttered before the 2014 crisis in Ukraine even
broke out. So before the U.S. Congress received what is has subsequently
considered undeniable and irrefutable proof of Russian aggression in
Ukraine, it was already quite prepared to view Russia solely as a
corrupt kleptocracy willfully abusing human rights, powered by an
irrational and paranoid hatred of the United States as the sole driver
of its foreign policy.]{.underline}

### State Centric

#### The aff is stuck in a militarist frame - we must look at the historical role of imperialism. Their centering of states and quantified arms exports obfuscates the role of imperial exceptionalism that restricts arms to reaffirm the moral imagery of the West as an arbiter of human rights

Anna **Stavrianakis in 2015**

Anna is a Senior Lecturer in International Relations at the University
of Sussex, Thinking Internationally About The Arms Trade,
https://thedisorderofthings.com/2015/10/02/thinking-internationally-about-the-arms-trade/

I've written in the past about the international politics of NGO and
campaign group strategy -- whether reformist, insider approaches are
more effective than transformist, outsider ones -- in the context of
debates about global civil society. Yet what continues to trouble me,
intellectually and politically, is a raft of questions about the
operation of the arms trade itself. Namely: [where]{.underline}, or with
whom[, does political responsibility lie for the negative effects of the
arms trade]{.underline} in a world of formally national states that are
home to internationalising arms companies and operate in a multilateral
system based on sovereignty? What social forces drive the arms trade,
how does their power operate, what is the character of the problems they
generate, and how should scholars and activists best respond? Competing
understandings of the operation of the arms trade can be seen in the
varied activist responses to it: is the problem one of lack of
regulation, the need for improved multilateral action, improved
normative standards and international law, as per the Arms Trade Treaty?
Or is the problem the relationship between the state and arms capital,
and government promotion of the trade, as per the anti-DSEI protests? In
the case of DSEI, how are we to understand the operation of
internationalising arms capital that has an intimate yet fractious
relationship with national states? And in the case of the Arms Trade
Treaty, how should we make sense of efforts to create a level playing
field of respect for human rights and humanitarian law in the context of
a vastly asymmetric and hierarchical world military order?¶ Thinking
theoretically, I have come to see that [a large part of the difficulty
in answering these questions lies in the grip that methodological
nationalism continues to hold on IR as a discipline]{.underline}.¶
Contemporary scholarship on the arms trade and arms transfer control
tends to operate within the realist-liberal-constructivist triangle that
dominates the mainstream of the wider discipline. Realist accounts of
balancing or threat perception sit alongside liberal accounts of
multilateral regimes for arms transfer control and constructivist
accounts of the symbolic politics of arms acquisition or human security
approaches to normative change and protection of human rights and
humanitarian law. Despite their many differences, [these approaches all
think in terms of relations between states]{.underline} (seen as
autonomous from both the arms industry and unscrupulous private brokers
as a social force), [and between the domestic and the
international]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline} particularly so
[because of the privileged claim that the arms trade has on national
defence and state sovereignty]{.underline}. Both in scholarship and
policy circles, **[the arms trade is a key bastion of methodologically
nationalist claims]{.underline}**. [The international appears as the sum
of its]{.underline} constituent [parts]{.underline}, of nation states.
**[What falls out, though, is the North-South dimension, which is
probably the most significant dimension of the arms trade as a
practice]{.underline}**. [The South features either in]{.underline} the
often blanket and sometimes [stereotyped]{.underline}, but [usually
under-theorised guise of the]{.underline} repressive, **[authoritarian
regime, the conflict-affected zone of disorder, or fragile
state]{.underline}**. [Even in]{.underline} cosmopolitan approaches that
probably do most to transcend methodological nationalism, in which the
international features in the form of international [humanitarian
law]{.underline} and universal human rights, [the South]{.underline}
primarily [features as a site of intervention]{.underline}, and we are
left with few intellectual or political resources for understanding
either the dynamics of the role of the arms trade in repression or
conflict, let alone southern resistance to seemingly obvious public
goods such as the Arms Trade Treaty. ¶ [The arms trade has long been
an]{.underline} international, and primarily [North-South,
phenomenon]{.underline}. The North-South dimension is fairly easy to
see: [two-thirds to three-quarters of contemporary international arms
transfers are to developing countries]{.underline}. In the postwar era,
the world's major arms suppliers have been the USA, West European states
and Russia, and the most significant importers have been found in the
Middle East and Asia. [Yet this remains stuck on the terrain of
methodological nationalism: we are still talking about
states]{.underline}, even though gesturing towards the hierarchy and
asymmetry captured in the notion of tiers. [And most data generated on
arms transfers is organised in terms of national states]{.underline} as
exporters and importers. [Whilst the terms "North" and "South" generally
map on to other binaries]{.underline} such as "developed" and
"underdeveloped", [the arms trade often throws up examples
that]{.underline} complicate things and [remind us that these
are]{.underline} primarily [political rather than geographical
categories]{.underline}. Israel, for example, is a niche high-tech
producer and supplier, integrated into western production networks,
engaged in a colonial war with part of its population, and located in a
region generally understood as southern. China is now a top five arms
exporter and is nurturing asymmetric relations with African states but
still sees itself a developing country. The growth of Chinese arms
exports should be seen as a return rather than a rise from nowhere -- it
was a major arms supplier when it supplied weapons to both sides in the
Iran-Iraq war; and gunpowder was invented in China as early as the 9th
century, troubling Eurocentric accounts of western military superiority.
And whilst most accounts of North-South politics focus on the liberal
West's engagement with the South, don't forget that the USSR, and now
Russia and former Soviet states also engage in various forms of
core-periphery relations with arms clients.¶ So we need to capture
core-periphery relations without assuming a world of national states.
[Rather than seeing the arms trade as the outward-facing activity of
pre-given national units, then]{.underline} (as happens in the
predominant supply-demand and import-export models), [we should rather
think in terms of the circulation of weapons as part of practices that
constitute those units as they prepare to fight, and do the fighting.
That means prioritising]{.underline} the significance of the
transnational exchange of military techniques between the European and
non-European world, and of **[colonialism in shaping the development,
production and transfer of weapons]{.underline}** (through practices
such as the dumping of obsolete weapons in the periphery). **[Arms
regulation is similarly marked by its imperial past, with some
remarkable resonances in the tropes and patterns of
control]{.underline}**. Drawing on the work historians of empire and
sociologists of the postcolonial, as well as IR scholarship on imperial
warfare, an imperial perspective can help transcend methodological
nationalism. What does this involve, and how can it help us unravel the
significance of the arms trade for contemporary international politics?¶
First, [an imperial perspective emphasises the ongoing resonance of the
historical legacy of formal empire]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
modern international [arms trade is usually deemed to have started with
the Industrial Revolution]{.underline}. But [this is a Eurocentric
position]{.underline} that assumes military innovation emerges from
within the European world and then spreads outwards -- much of the older
critical literature on the arms trade shares this perspective, even as
it identifies itself as politically progressive. [Yet colonialism was
not something that happened after the European world industrialised and
became modern -- it was part of the process]{.underline} through which
the European world industrialised and became modern, and through which
the non-European world got called under-industrialised and pre-modern.
[Non-Eurocentric accounts]{.underline} of military production and trade
are rare, but valuable. They [help us understand the international
circulation of techniques]{.underline}, practices and ideas in the arms
trade, and challenge entrenched notions of superior western military
ingenuity.¶ [Second]{.underline}, methodologically, **[this means
reading the history and contemporary politics of North and South
together, as a single shared story. It encourages us to think in terms
of feedback loops]{.underline}** and mutual constitution**[, rather than
transmission]{.underline}**, diffusion or other linear metaphors that we
often use to think about the spread and circulation of military
technologies and practices. Such linear metaphors dominate both liberal
and leftist accounts, as the rise of the West and transmission of its
good ideas or domination of the developing world, respectively.¶
[Third]{.underline}, and relatedly, [thinking]{.underline} in such a way
**[requires taking seriously Southern agency]{.underline}** (albeit
under conditions of hierarchy) **[and considering it as central rather
than an add-on. In arms trade terms, this means we have to pay attention
to Southern autonomy in weapons acquisition]{.underline}**; the
importance of blowback and the controversy that ensues when patrons are
unable to control the use of weapons they transfer; and the ways that
relations with the South shape developments in the North, such as when
export concerns distort domestic weapons acquisition. ¶ **[Fourth is the
importance of avoiding technological determinism and
bean-counting]{.underline}**. That is**[, it's not technology per se
that matters but how weapons are incorporated into military practice and
social relations. For me, this is the importance of a militarism frame
for analysing the arms trade, one inflected through an imperial
perspective. It means we cannot simply count the number of
tanks]{.underline}** or sniper rifles **[exported]{.underline}** and
cite that as evidence of complicity in repression and militarisation.
[This]{.underline} is not to toe the government and arms company line
that assumes innocence as to the likely use of weapons. But it [does
require us to demonstrate the entrenched patterns that mean weapons are
likely to be misused]{.underline}, even if this particular technology or
that one hasn't been directly used previously. Whilst some of this is
being done by NGOs such as Amnesty International, they remain on the
same terrain as the government in pursuing a case-by-case approach to
arms export decisions. [What a militarism frame adds is that the direct
use of weapons is just the tip of the iceberg: their indirect role in
repression and war through the climate of fear, as well as political
economy and patronage networks they facilitate is equally
significant]{.underline}.¶ Fifth, [a key advantage]{.underline} of an
imperial perspective on the arms trade [is that it allows us to
overcome]{.underline} one of [the]{.underline} key [distinctions
drawn]{.underline} in most extant scholarship, namely that [between the
West and non-West]{.underline} **[on the basis of human rights and other
supposed liberal values]{.underline}**. **[Even when there is criticism
of western suppliers for transfers that violate human rights, the
commitment to human rights itself is generally taken as genuine, and
forms the key line of distinction with suppliers such as Russia and
China. But to my mind, the separation between western and non-western
practices on the basis of liberal values is one of the key tropes
obscuring the operation of the arms trade]{.underline}**.
[Justifications based on values of human rights]{.underline} (as per
European suppliers), [and justifications based on legal strictures
around sovereignty]{.underline} (as per Russia and China) **[facilitate
some remarkably similar practices: the arming of proxies, cultivation of
patronage relations, the core trying to organise force in the
periphery]{.underline}**.

### Threats/Insecurity

#### The 1AC is part of a desire to displace the insecurities of everyday life onto an external narrative- this entrenches militarism as ideology and presents it as a necessity

Victoria M **Basham in 2018**

Cardiff University, UK, Liberal militarism as insecurity,¶ desire and
ambivalence: Gender,¶ race and the everyday geopolitics¶ of war,
Security Dialogue¶ ﻿1--¶ 12

As Salter (2006: 180) explains, though[, it is not simply that states
manage subjects but that the¶ price of 'freedom']{.underline}, of an
everyday life removed from insecurity, [is that 'we come to manage
ourselves¶ through a confessionary complex']{.underline}. Key to this is
that [we 'recognize ourselves as a society]{.underline}, as¶ part of a
social entity, as a part of a nation or of a state' (Michel Foucault,
cited in Salter, 2006: 181)¶ [and regard others as outside this. The
desire for this way of life means]{.underline}, therefore, **[that it is
not just¶ existential insecurity that facilitates war and war
preparedness, but the multitude of insecurities that¶ make up everyday
life]{.underline}**, [from needing to have steady employment to wanting
to feel part of a]{.underline} social¶ and political
[community]{.underline}. Thus, [while global fears are materialized and
affective in everyday sites,¶ other and often more pressing matters also
play a role in the reproduction of liberal militarism]{.underline}
(Pain¶ and Smith, 2008). As Dowler (2012: 497) points out, **[this is
why it is vital to consider how 'militarization¶ takes root in the banal
processes of daily life that are essential to the reproduction of¶
sovereignty']{.underline}**.¶ As Eastwood (this issue) argues, though,
**[everyday desire for war also animates militarism]{.underline}**;
fear¶ only gets us so far. Importantly, however, as Eastwood also
contends, **[desire is not necessarily¶ fervent: it can be more
ambiguous, even unconscious]{.underline}**. Anthropologist Gerald Sider
(2008: 124--¶ 125) sheds further light on this when describing the
everyday as an achievement; as those ways in¶ which people work through
and against the chaos, rupture and discontinuity that shape their lives¶
to 'try to make and to claim some kind of ordinary -- some stability to
today, some continuity¶ between yesterday and tomorrow, in some parts of
their lives at least'. Sider (2008: 125) moreover¶ maintains that ['what
we call everyday life does not name a feature or an aspect of social
existence¶ ... but a very high-stakes struggle']{.underline} [-- a
struggle that is for many people throughout the world¶ 'largely
unavoidable and often in the medium to long run
unwinnable']{.underline}. [The desire for the ordinary¶ should not be
underestimated, therefore; it takes on a profound, if often
taken-for-granted, importance]{.underline}¶ not least 'because it
belongs to the people who have it -- it is their time, their space,
what¶ makes their moments and their interactions their space and place'
(Sider, 2008: 129--130, emphasis¶ in original).¶ [It is not difficult to
imagine why this possession of 'normality' would be desirable to
liberal¶ populations promised that freedom is the very condition of
their existence]{.underline}. [Perceived threats to that¶ freedom might
motivate fears and suspicions that foster militarism]{.underline}.
Equally, though, in the example¶ of Syrian airstrikes, and hostility and
ambivalence to resettling Syrian refugees, the desire of¶ British
citizens to have everyday lives free from concern about the everyday
lives of others may¶ call into question the ability of Syrians to have
not only an everyday but any life at all. While such¶ effects of desire
to protect one's own everyday are not always deliberate or callous, [the
prioritization¶ of some lives and ways of life over others facilitates
biopolitical forms of state power that¶ entail that 'the liberal way of
war is governed, in part, by the very exercise of such discrimination¶
and the application of lethal violence to it']{.underline} (Dillon and
Reid, 2009: 49).

### War/Peace Focus

#### The affirmative's geopolitical imagination of policy centers on macropolitical state rivalries and threats---this conflict prevention strategy rationalizes the world for an institutionalized slow violence that squashes any resistance. 

**Dalby 11**

professor @ Carleton University

(Simon, 'PEACE AND GEOPOLITICS: IMAGINING PEACEFUL GEOGRAPHIES,' Paper
for presentation to the University of Newcastle symposium on Peace in
Geography and Politics)

Contemporary social theory might point to Michel Foucault, and the
argument drawn from his writings that politics is the extension of war
rather than the other way round. Given the interest in biopolitics and
geogovernance within the discipline these matters are obviously relevant
but the connection to [peace needs to be **thought carefully** beyond
formulations that simply assume it as **the opposite of
wars**]{.underline} (Morrissey 2011). [This is especially the case given
the **changing modes of contemporary warfare**]{.underline} and the
advocacy of violence as an appropriate policy in present circumstances.
[The modes of warfare at the heart of liberalism suggest
that]{.underline} the [security]{.underline} of what Reid and Dillon
(2009) call the biohuman, the liberal consuming subject, [involves a
**violent series of practices designed to pacify the world by the
elimination of political alternatives**]{.underline}. [The tension here
suggests **an imperial peace, a forceful imposition of a state of
non-war**]{.underline}. In George W. Bush's terms justifying the war on
terror, a long struggle to eliminate tyranny (Dalby 2009a). Peace is, in
this geopolitical understanding, what comes after the elimination of
opposition. In late 2011 such formulations dominated discussions of the
death of Colonel Gadaffi in Libya.¶ [The dramatic transformation of
human affairs]{.underline} in the last couple of generations [do require
that]{.underline} would-be [peaceful geographers look both
to]{.underline} the importance of [non-violence and simultaneously to
how **global transformations are changing the landscape of violence**
and social change, all]{.underline} of it still [under the threat of
nuclear devastation]{.underline} should major inter-state war occur once
again. The re-emergence of non-violence as an explicit political
strategy, and in particular the use of Gene Sharp's (1973) ideas of
non-violent direct action in recent events pose these questions very
pointedly. [Geographers have much to offer in such
re-thinking]{.underline} that may yet play their part [in a more global
understanding of how interconnected our fates are becoming]{.underline}
and how inappropriate national state boundaries are as the premise for
political action in a rapidly changing biosphere.¶ But to do so [some
hard thinking is needed on geopolitics, and on how it works as well as
how peace-full scholarship might foster that which it
desires]{.underline}. Linking the practical actions of non-violence from
Tahrir Square to those of the Occupy Wall Street actions, underway as
the first draft of this paper was keyboarded, requires that we think
very carefully about the practices that now are designated in terms of
globalization. Not all this is novel, but [the geopolitical scene is
shifting in ways that need to be incorporated into the new
thinking]{.underline} within geography [about war, peace, violence and
what]{.underline} the discipline might have [to say about, and
contribute to, **non-violence as well as to contestations of
contemporary lawfare**]{.underline} (Gregory 2006).¶ Whether the
delegitimization of violence as a mode of rule will be extended further
in coming decades is one of the big questions facing peace researchers.
The American reaction to 9/11 set things back dramatically, an
opportunity to respond in terms of response to a crime and diplomacy was
squandered, but the [**wider social refusal to accept repression and
violence** as appropriate modes of rule has]{.underline} interesting
[potential to **constrain the**]{.underline} use of
**[military]{.underline}** force. The professionalization of many high
technology militaries also reduces their inclination to involve
themselves in repressing social movements, although here Mikhail
Gorbachev's refusal to use the Red Army against dissidents in Eastern
Europe in the late 1980s remains emblematic of the changes norms of
acceptable rule that have been extended in the last few generations.¶ [A
geography discipline seriously interested in peace needs to **link the
social processes on the relatively small scale** such as]{.underline}
the [non-violent protests]{.underline} Megoran (2011) highlights,
[and]{.underline} the [peaceful accompaniment actions]{.underline} that
Koopman (2011) documents, [to **the larger geopolitical transformations
of our times**, to make the]{.underline} eminently geographical [point
that peace activities]{.underline} vary widely from place to place, but
now [are an important part of]{.underline} larger [contemporary
geopolitical transformations. ¶ Geopolitics has mostly been about
**rivalries between great powers** and]{.underline} their [contestations
of power on **the large scale**]{.underline}. [These specifications of
the political world focus on states and]{.underline} the perpetuation of
[**threats mapped as external dangers** to **supposedly pacific
polities**]{.underline}. Much [geopolitical discourse specifies the
world as a dangerous place]{.underline}, hence [precisely because of
these mappings]{.underline}, one supposedly **[necessitating
violence]{.underline}** in what **[passes for a realist interpretation
of great powers]{.underline}** as the prime movers of history
(Mearsheimer 2001). [Geopolitical thinking is about order and order
is]{.underline} in part [a cartographic notion]{.underline}. Juliet
[Fall]{.underline} (2010) once again [emphasizes the importance of taken
for granted boundaries as **the ontological given of contemporary
politics**]{.underline}. Politics is about the cartographic control of
territories, as Megoran (2011) too ponders regarding the first half of
the twentieth century, but it also about much more than this, despite
the fascination that so many commentators have with the ideal form of
the supposedly national territorial state. Part of what geographers
bring to [the discussion of peace is a **more nuanced geographical
imagination**]{.underline} than that found in so much of international
studies (Dalby 2011a).¶ On the other hand much of the discussion of
peace sees war as the problem, peace as the solution. [Implied in that
is **geopolitics as the problem**, mapping dangers turns out to
be]{.underline} a [dangerous]{.underline} enterprise [insofar as it
**facilitates the perpetuation of violence by representing other places
as threats**]{.underline} to which our place is susceptible. But this
only matters if [this is related to the realist assumptions of the
inevitability of rivalry, the eternal search for power as key to
humanity's self-organisation and the assumption that organized violence
is the ultimate arbiter]{.underline} (Dalby 2010). Critical geopolitics
is about challenging such contextualizations, and as such its
relationships to peace would seem to be obvious, albeit as Megoran
(2011) notes mostly by way of a focus on what Galtung (1969, 1971) calls
negative peace. [Given the repeated **reinvention of colonial tropes**
in contemporary Western political discourse]{.underline} such [critique
remains]{.underline} an [essential]{.underline} part of a political
geography that grants peoples "the courtesy of political geography"
(Mitchell and Smith 1991). [**Undercutting the moral logics of
violence**, so frequently relying on **simplistic invocations
of**]{.underline} geographical **[inevitability]{.underline}**, to
structure their apologetics, [remains a **crucial**
contribution.¶]{.underline} Both [the practical matters of recent
history]{.underline} and the scholarly contributions by geographers [do
not allow **simple binary distinctions of peace and war** to be used as
the premise of either scholarship or political practice. History and
scholarship suggest]{.underline} rather that [peace is what comes
**after war**; the relationship is **temporal**]{.underline}, stages in
matters of violence, geography and reorganizing facts on the ground.
Historically in the era of European warfare, coincident with the rise of
modernity, that many people hope is now near its end, [peace was that
which was **imposed by the victors**]{.underline}, who in turn were the
most powerful in whatever contest was followed by a "peace". Much recent
geographical scholarship suggests that [post conflict re-construction is
a mode of peace building literally]{.underline} (Kirsch and Flint 2011).
[But those of us who would **challenge war as a human institution**, or
think about non-violence as a strategy]{.underline} for a better world,
[will not be satisfied]{.underline} with a geography that is concerned
[only to pick up the pieces and reconfigure them after they have been
**shattered by the latest round of organized violence**]{.underline}.¶
The key points are that [reconstruction is a **violent transformation**
of society]{.underline}, a world where frequently [neo-liberal
globalization is]{.underline} seen as [the **imposition of social forms
that will not resist its logics**]{.underline}. [Hence peace is what
victors impose, an **imperial peace**]{.underline} that may eventually
be quite welcome to those who benefit from the new arrangements. [Is
peace then post-war? Perhaps]{.underline} it can be understood in these
terms. [But the corollary is]{.underline} the [equally
important]{.underline} point that [peace is]{.underline} also frequently
[what comes before **the next war**]{.underline}. The normal human
situation these days is a matter of non-war, but it is far from clear
where security is enforced that this is more than a limited form of
negative peace. **[Without large-scale de-militarization then peace is
just what happens between wars]{.underline}**. But given this then one
additional key point that geographers interested in war need to pay
attention to is the matter of how peace fails, how conflict escalates
and how geography matters in these processes (Flint et al 2009).
Peacekeeping is frequently about geographical separation as the
Orwellian names for contemporary walls in terms of lines of peace have
it. But there is much more geographical thinking to be done about these
matters and the scales of interactions across supposedly peaceful
borders, not least where what matters most is state security and its
ordering principles rather than local interactions across frontiers.
This is so not least because of the marked current trend to build fences
around states as the supposed solution to numerous security challenges
(Jones 2011).¶ Putting matters into historical context also suggests
that **[war is not what it used to be]{.underline}**, at least not after
the events of the 1940s. [Negative peace is about **preventing
conflict**; non-violence is about **political strategies to delegitimise
violence, to challenge the human norms of behavior that allow cultures
of violence**]{.underline}. [It is important to link this to the issues
of what are now called lawfare]{.underline} (Morrissey 2011), [the use
of law as **power and coercion** to **set the rules of social and
political life**]{.underline} too. [This has been a key part
of]{.underline} the [US strategy for a long time; **shaping institutions
to the benefit of the US economy**]{.underline} as been what much of
international relations has been about, but the larger benefits of
constraining conflict are part of the larger process that international
law struggles to legitimize. Rules of conduct matter in the
international system and the wide-scale repudiation of the American
invasion of Iraq in 2003 demonstrated this point clearly.

**Ext Dalby- External Threats L**

- **rivalries between state powers focus on external threats to prevent
  future conflicts**

- **mapping dangers perpetuates violence by picking and choosing enemies
  to justify violence against them**

- **in a world of militarization, peace becomes recognized as only a
  time between wars instead of a sustained process**

- **the alt solves this through an understanding of why the state labels
  certain groups as threats and instead of acting on those, recognizing
  the structural conditions that creates those conflicts in the first
  place**

### Endless Violence

#### Structural violence locks in social and environmental tension\-\--culminates in extinction and makes war inevitable 

Tamás **Szentes 8**, Professor Emeritus at the Corvinus University of
Budapest. "Globalisation and prospects of the world society" 4/22/08

It' s a common place that [human society can survive]{.underline} and
develop [only in a lasting real peace]{.underline}. Without peace
countries cannot develop. Although since 1945 there has been no world
war, but \--numerous local wars took place, \--terrorism has spread all
over the world, undermining security even in the most developed and
powerful countries, \--[arms race and militarisation have]{.underline}
not ended with the collapse of the Soviet bloc, but
[escalated]{.underline} and continued, extending also to weapons of mass
destruction and misusing enormous resources badly needed for
development, \--**[many "invisible wars" are suffered by the
poor]{.underline}** and oppressed people, **[manifested in mass misery,
poverty, unemployment, homelessness, starvation]{.underline}** and
malnutrition, [epidemics and poor health conditions,]{.underline}
**[exploitation and oppression]{.underline}**, [racial]{.underline} and
other [discrimination]{.underline}, physical terror, [organised
injustice]{.underline}, disguised forms of violence, the denial or
regular infringement of the democratic rights of citizens, women, youth,
ethnic or religious minorities, etc., **[and]{.underline}** last but not
least, **[in the degradation of human environment]{.underline}**, which
means that \--**[the "war against Nature]{.underline}**", i.e. the
disturbance of ecological balance, wasteful management of natural
resources, [and large-scale pollution of our environment]{.underline},
is still going on, causing also losses and fatal dangers for human life.
**[Behind]{.underline}** global terrorism and **["invisible wars" we
find striking international and intrasociety inequities and distorted
development patterns]{.underline}** , **[which tend to generate social
as well as international tensions]{.underline}**, thus **[paving the way
for unrest and "visible" wars]{.underline}**. It is a commonplace now
that peace is not merely the absence of war. [The **prerequisites** of a
**lasting peace**]{.underline} between and within societies [involve not
only]{.underline} - though, of course, necessarily - [demilitarisation,
but also a]{.underline} systematic [and]{.underline} gradual
[elimination of the roots of violence, of the causes of "invisible
wars", of the structural and institutional bases of]{.underline}
large-scale international and intra-society [inequalities,]{.underline}
[exploitation and oppression]{.underline}. **[Peace requires a process
of]{.underline}** social and national **[emancipation]{.underline}**, a
progressive, democratic transformation of societies and the world
bringing about equal rights and opportunities for all people, sovereign
participation and mutually advantageous co-operation among nations. It
further requires a pluralistic democracy on global level with an
appropriate system of proportional representation of the world society,
articulation of diverse interests and their peaceful reconciliation, by
non-violent conflict management, and thus also a global governance with
a really global institutional system. Under the contemporary conditions
of accelerating globalisation and deepening global interdependencies in
our world, **[peace]{.underline}** is indivisible in both time and
space. It cannot exist if reduced to a period only after or before war,
and **[cannot be safeguarded in one part of the world when some others
suffer visible or invisible wars]{.underline}**. Thus, peace requires,
indeed, a new, demilitarised and democratic world order, which can
provide equal opportunities for sustainable development. "Sustainability
of development" (both on national and world level) is often interpreted
as an issue of environmental protection only and reduced to the need for
preserving the ecological balance and delivering the next generations
not a destroyed Nature with overexhausted resources and polluted
environment. However, **[no ecological balance can be ensured, unless
the deep international development gap and intra-society inequalities
are substantially reduced]{.underline}**. Owing to global
interdependencies there may exist hardly any "zero-sum-games", in which
one can gain at the expense of others, but, instead, the
"negative-sum-games" tend to predominate, in which everybody must
suffer, later or sooner, directly or indirectly, losses. Therefore,
[the]{.underline} actual [question is not about "sustainability of
development" but]{.underline} rather **[about the "sustainability of
human life",]{.underline}** **[i.e. survival of mankind]{.underline}**
-- because of ecological imbalance and globalised terrorism. When
Professor Louk de la Rive Box was the president of EADI, one day we had
an exchange of views on the state and future of development studies. We
agreed that development studies are not any more restricted to the case
of underdeveloped countries, as the developed ones (as well as the
former "socialist" countries) are also facing development problems, such
as those of structural and institutional (and even system-)
transformation, requirements of changes in development patterns, and
concerns about natural environment. While all these are true, today I
would dare say that besides (or even instead of) "development studies"
we must speak about and make "survival studies". While the monetary,
financial, and debt crises are cyclical, [we live in an]{.underline}
[almost **permanent crisis**]{.underline} of the world society, which is
multidimensional in nature, involving not only economic but also
socio-psychological, behavioural, cultural and political aspects. **[The
narrow-minded, election-oriented, selfish behaviour motivated by thirst
for power and wealth,]{.underline}** which still characterise the
political leadership almost all over the world, **[paves the way for the
final, last catastrophe]{.underline}**. One cannot doubt, of course,
that great many positive historical changes have also taken place in the
world in the last century. Such as decolonisation, transformation of
socio-economic systems, democratisation of political life in some former
fascist or authoritarian states, institutionalisation of welfare
policies in several countries, rise of international organisations and
new forums for negotiations, conflict management and cooperation,
institutionalisation of international assistance programmes by
multilateral agencies, codification of human rights, and rights of
sovereignty and democracy also on international level, collapse of the
militarised Soviet bloc and system-change3 in the countries concerned,
the end of cold war, etc., to mention only a few. Nevertheless, the
crisis of the world society has extended and deepened, approaching to a
point of bifurcation that necessarily puts an end to the present
tendencies, either by the final catastrophe or a common solution.
**[Under the circumstances provided by rapidly progressing science and
technological revolutions, human society cannot survive unless such
profound intra-society and international inequalities prevailing today
are soon eliminated]{.underline}**. Like a single spacecraft, the
**[Earth can no longer afford to have]{.underline}** a \'crew\' divided
into [two parts: the rich, privileged]{.underline}, wellfed,
well-educated, [on the one hand, and the poor, deprived]{.underline},
starving, sick and uneducated, [on the other]{.underline}. Dangerous
\'zero-sum-games\' (which mostly prove to be "negative-sum-games") can
hardly be played any more by visible or invisible wars in the world
society. Because of global interdependencies, the apparent winner
becomes also a loser. The real choice for the world society is between
negative- and positive-sum-games: i.e. between, on the one hand,
continuation of visible and "invisible wars", as long as this is
possible at all, and, on the other, transformation of the world order by
demilitarisation and democratization. No ideological or terminological
camouflage can conceal this real dilemma any more, which is to be faced
not in the distant future, by the next generations, but in the coming
years, because of global terrorism soon having nuclear and other mass
destructive weapons, and also due to irreversible changes in natural
environment.

### Env/Survival

#### Every aspect of militarism exacerbates environmental destruction- survival is impossible without addressing the ideological sources of destruction

[It is obvious that during active combat]{.underline} fighter jets,
destroyers, tanks and whole arsenals of¶ other [weapon systems are
extremely carbon-intensive]{.underline}165 and often discharge other
highly ¶ toxic emissions, not to mention the emissions that are released
by oil fires.¶ 166 This causes¶ catastrophic devastation at all levels
of the biosphere167¶ . However, **[the active hostilities are¶ only
responsible for a fraction of the actual damage to the
environment]{.underline}**.168¶ As if the relation between the natural
environment and humanity was not complex enough,¶ the developments that
this relationship is going through in times of crisis and conflict are¶
adding further complications in blurring the borders of war and peace.
Environmental harm is¶ not confined only to combat, claims the
environmental historian Tait Keller when he analyses¶ this relation and
expands his focus beyond actual hostilities. He argues that [the
environmental¶ damage that was created by]{.underline} the First [World
War lies not so much in the destruction]{.underline} [of actual¶
battlegrounds but rather in the change of human behaviour and
drastically increased industrial¶ production.]{.underline} This new
behaviour is essentially different in regards to consumerism and energy¶
consumption with connections to fossil fuels, deforestation, toxic waste
and general¶ pollution.169 [What actually destroyed our natural
environment and is still active in its¶ destruction is "the spread
of]{.underline} industrial methods and **[mentalities of
production]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} hindered¶ natural
processes, upset local ecological balances, and [increased human
exploitation the world¶ over]{.underline}."170¶ In fact, [the
environmental (and human) sufferings created by militarism
"are]{.underline} so [far-reaching¶]{.underline} that a full examination
of them would produce countless volumes".171¶ The International Peace
Bureau lists a number of [direct ways in which military activity
affects¶ our]{.underline} physical [environment172]{.underline}¶ :¶ 
[Pollution]{.underline} of the air, land and water in peacetime¶ 
Immediate and long-term effects of armed conflict (explosions,
landmines, unexploded¶ remnants, chemical weapons, burning oil wells and
oil spills, etc.)¶ [Land use]{.underline} (vast areas of land and water
occupied by military bases, target ranges,¶ weapon stores, training
grounds; pollution and degradation from storage,¶ deforestation,
scorched earth tactics, etc.)¶  **[Weapons development and
production]{.underline}** (design, development, manufacturing, tests,¶
storage, transport, disposal, etc.)¶  Militarisation of outer space
(rocket launches, missile systems and satellites, space¶ littering)¶
Additionally, **[indirect effects through the diversion of resources
have to be taken into¶ account.]{.underline}**¶ 1¶ This list is by no
means exhaustive and one could find hundreds of disastrous examples,
like¶ [reduction of biodiversity]{.underline} from the extinction of 47
plant species and 19 classes of trees in the¶ Nagorno-Karabakh war174¶ ,
or the 91,000 litre oil spill in Micronesia from an US tanker that sunk¶
in 1944175¶ , [or the 50 nuclear warheads and 11 nuclear reactors
littering the ocean floor from¶ naval accidents]{.underline} in the Cold
War176¶ , [or the brain drain and waste of young lives by the military¶
sector, or the depletion of ecosystems for food and energy
supply]{.underline} after conflicts, etcetera.¶ **[Literally "all
aspects of military activity defile our environment in some
way]{.underline}**."177¶ [Special attention has to be paid to the huge
and permanent costs of maintaining military¶ equipment and
personnel]{.underline}, who require housing, infrastructure, heating,
air conditioning,¶ transport, nourishment and many other goods and
services. **[The production of military¶ equipment consumes enormous
amounts of materials]{.underline}**, like metal, rubber, plastics and
rare¶ earths. Also [there is massive energy usage involved, mostly from
unsustainable resources]{.underline}.¶ Nuclear weapons are particular
heavyweights in production and maintenance, not to speak of¶ their
dismantling.178¶ When there is no actual combat, 70% of soldiers'
activities are military exercises and training,¶ consuming vast amounts
of ammunition and fuel, disrupting local ecosystems or killing ¶
animals179¶ .¶ 180 Also, military material and technology is by no means
faultless and accidents¶ occur regularly.¶ 181¶ [Several authors regard
MIMEC as the largest polluter on the planet]{.underline}.182 When all
the facts¶ above are taken into account it seems quite possible [**that
militarism is the biggest contributor¶ to climate change with its
massive GHG emissions, destruction of ecosystems and biodiversity,¶**
massive waste of energy supplies]{.underline}, huge impacts on social,
cultural and economic behaviour,¶ destabilisation of international
politics **[and obstruction of climate policies. Consequently, there¶
can be no successful overcoming the climate crisis without peace and
dismantling MIMEC.]{.underline}**¶ 182

#### Militarism causes cycles of environmental destruction- it's engrained in the ideology

The treadmill of destruction is a descendant of the treadmill of
production, a theory that¶ argues that environmental degradation is an
inherent part of economic development and that¶ the capitalistic growth
imperative creates a perpetual conflict between human societies and¶ the
environment. An important aspect of the theory is that [producers strive
for externalisation¶ of environmental costs to increase their
profits]{.underline}.185 [The treadmill of destruction
(military)]{.underline} is¶ closely intertwined with the treadmill of
production (economy) but [generates distinct ¶ tendencies of
growth]{.underline}, [requiring humongous amounts of capital, energy and
raw materials]{.underline}, 186¶ **[thus creating a path
dependency]{.underline}**.187¶ In recent times, **[militarism's aspect
of defence has been increasingly invoked in relation to neocolonialism
and acquiring resources like oil]{.underline}**.188 [Nations with larger
and advanced militaries¶ regularly use their coercive power to obtain
disproportionate access to natural resources]{.underline},¶
predominantly in the global South.¶ 189 [Geopolitical
competition]{.underline} between states often [drives¶ arms races, which
in turn boost technological developments]{.underline}, which in
consequence enhance¶ the damaging capabilities of military forces. Since
the Second World War [the military was¶ promoted into the political and
economic elites, rooting the treadmill of destruction in¶ national and
international politics]{.underline}.190 [This is particularly true for
the]{.underline} situation of the [USA where¶ military production
averted economic stagnation and supported the entire economic¶
structure]{.underline}.191 Military spending is perfectly suited for the
capitalist growth system, pumping¶ capital into private production,
distributing income upward and always finding a market192, if¶ not
producing its own. Militarism influences the willingness and timing of
states to ratify¶ environmental treaties193, as was obvious from the
USA's behaviour in the Kyoto negotiations.¶ [Access to oil has become a
fundamental motive for wars, in which massive amounts of oil are¶
burned, aggravating climate change]{.underline}.¶ 194 **[The huge
reliance of militaries on fossil fuels and their¶ enormous contributions
to burn it quickly conclude "a self-perpetuating cycle of¶
destruction]{.underline}**."¶ 195

#### Militarism makes environmental destruction inevitable

**Bennis 18** (Phyllis Bennis \-- fellow @ the Institute for Policy
Studies, "A Green New Deal Needs to Fight US Militarism", Jacobin
Magazine,
https://jacobinmag.com/2019/05/green-new-deal-fight-militarism-imperialism,
8 October 2018)

[The war on terror]{.underline} unleashed in the wake of the 9/11
terrorist attack has [led to]{.underline} almost two [decades of
unchecked militarism. We]{.underline} are [spend]{.underline}ing [more
money on]{.underline} our [military than at any time in history. Endless
wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Syria and elsewhere are]{.underline}
still [raging, more wars are threatened against Iran and beyond, costing
the US trillions of dollars and creating]{.underline} humanitarian
[disasters. Treaties to control nuclear arms are unraveling]{.underline}
at the same time that conflicts with the major powers of [Russia and
China are heating up.]{.underline}

The Green New Deal must have anti-militarism at its core. [Wars and the
military render impossible the aspirations contained in the Green New
Deal.]{.underline} And [slashing the out-of-control military budget is
crucial to provide the billions of dollars we need to create a
sustainable and egalitarian economy.]{.underline}

To fund the Green New Deal, with all of its component parts, [we must
transition away from the current war economy that pollutes the planet,
distorts our society, enriches only the war profiteers. An end to US
wars across the globe and massive cuts to the military budget will
provide funds for green jobs, public education, health care for all,
green infrastructure development.]{.underline} And [we will transition
our nation's security]{.underline} away [from failed and failing wars
into a new foreign policy based on peace and diplomacy]{.underline}, not
war.

The Military and the Environment

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tate[s' militarized war economy
plays a major role in the destruction of our planet's vital life support
systems. The military uses enormous amounts of fossil fuels
and]{.underline} other [chemicals that poison]{.underline} the [air,
water, and land]{.underline} human beings depend, both within US borders
and [across the globe]{.underline} where US forces, planes, drones and
other war machines go to war. [Where the US military establishes
bases]{.underline} abroad, [the local environment always
suffers.]{.underline} As David Vine noted in his seminal book Base
Nation, [the carbon footprint of military bases is enormous. They house
carbon-spewing tanks and aircrafts, and use tremendous energy for
climate control and electricity]{.underline}. "The military's thirst for
petroleum," Vine writes, "is so great that on a worldwide basis, [the US
armed services consume more oil every day than]{.underline} the entire
country of [Sweden]{.underline}." To make matters worse, in many
countries, Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) with the host government
prohibit local authorities from investigating environmental destruction
caused by US military bases.

As documented by the Institute for Policy Studies and the Poor People's
Campaign, [US wars]{.underline} have [left a toxic legacy in their
global wake, poisoning soil and water and polluting air for decades
after the formal end to hostilities.]{.underline} And the military sows
environmental destruction within the US, as well. The IPS/PPC report
notes that "the Pentagon is directly responsible for 141 Superfund
sites" --- ten percent of all such sites, far exceeding any other
polluter --- while "760 or so additional Superfund sites are abandoned
military facilities or sites that otherwise support military needs."
[The carbon footprint of the military industrial complex is]{.underline}
also [staggering]{.underline}: In 2016, [the]{.underline} Department of
Defense ([DoD]{.underline}) [emitted 66.4 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide,]{.underline} representing over [two-thirds of the]{.underline}
entire [emissions of the US government.]{.underline} Tellingly, however,
[the military's overseas emissions are exempted from the U.S.
government's carbon accounting]{.underline} --- [despite representing a
majority of the DoD's emissions.]{.underline}

Slash the Military Budget, Fund Green Jobs

[The US military is]{.underline} clearly [an obstacle to a safe
climate]{.underline} --- so [any comprehensive climate justice policy
must confront US militarism head on.]{.underline} What would the Green
New Deal's peaceful foreign policy look like?

### Global Warming/Env

#### Militarism is the largest cause of global warming- it's impossible to address climate change without demilitarization

Mag. Florian **Polsterer in 2015**

Democratisation¶ Academic Year 2014/2015; ¶ The Impacts of Militarism on

[Within MIMEC the]{.underline} US Department of Defense ([DoD) is the
largest polluter]{.underline} and waster.¶ 135¶ Although data is
generally hard to come by, **[it reportedly burns at least a startling
365,000¶ barrels of oil daily (other estimations amount to
500,000]{.underline}** barrels)¶ 136¶ . Per year this is a usage of¶
unimaginable 20 billion litres (5.46 billion gallons)¶ 137¶ . To make
matters worse, this number¶ might include neither fuel consumed by
contractors or in leased and privatised facilities nor¶ the excessive
energy and resources used to produce and maintain weapons and
equipment.138¶ It has been calculated that about [one third of the total
US military spending just accounts for¶ securing energy supplies
worldwide]{.underline}.139 To top it all, [the efficiency of fuel use is
far from¶ improving]{.underline}, admitted the pentagon, [with
soldiers]{.underline} in the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars [consuming¶ 16
times more fuel]{.underline}140 [than in the Second World
War]{.underline}.141 Bearing in mind that the data from the¶ pentagon
are possibly even undervalued, it is clear that the USA is a hopeless
oil addict142¶ ,¶ **[making the US military "the world's largest
institutional source of greenhouse gases]{.underline}**."143¶ The DoD is
alone responsible for about 40% of global military expenditures.¶ 144
Including the¶ costs of bygone wars145, [the USA is spending
40%]{.underline} (almost 1 trillion USD146) [of its]{.underline} annual
[budget¶ on militarisation]{.underline}. **[This imbalanced spending has
dire consequences for programs addressing¶ climate change, education,
healthcare, culture, preventing war or reducing income¶
inequality]{.underline}**.147 It is troubling that the US Government
Accountability Office (GAO) has not been¶ able to audit the DoD for the
last 20 years and deems it to be of high risk for waste, fraud and¶
abuse.148¶ This serious diversion from better use is obvious and weighs
even heavier when one compares¶ the annual subsidies to fossil fuel
industries (37,5 billion USD)149 to (only non-binding) pledges¶ for
long-term climate finance (1,5 billion USD)¶ 150¶ .¶ 151¶ Interestingly,
already in 1992 the UN Secretariat estimated the annual costs for
effectively¶ preserving the environment (and securing development) to be
1000 billion USD, back then the¶ almost exact amount the world spent per
year for military defence. Today the ratios surely¶ have changed (and
probably for the worse, since delayed climate investments have to be
far¶ bigger), but **[it is unthinkable to curb climate change without a
fundamental redirection of the¶ financial and material resources that
are being wasted on the illusion of military security]{.underline}**.
[An¶ illusion because modern weapons are a main threat to all life forms
and life-supporting¶ systems]{.underline}.¶ 152¶ Comparing the graphs of
rising GHG emissions and the US military expenditures (Figure 14),¶ one
can find similarities. **[The rise of GHG emissions and military
spending reflects an¶ undeniable connection between MIMEC and global
warming]{.underline}**.153¶ The USA was so bold to demand the inclusion
of a provision exempting its military activities¶ from measurement and
reductions worldwide before signing the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. But¶
even after seizing this concession the Bush Administration refused to
sign the protocol.¶ Furthermore, the US Congress adopted a provision
guaranteeing the US military forces¶ immunity from any measurement or
energy consumption limits. The executive order from¶ President Obama for
federal agencies to reduce their GHG emissions (only by 2020) does not¶
apply to the US military and leaves it free from any climate
responsibility154¶ .¶ 155¶ [The US military industry is of course a
blatant example of how militarism threatens the¶ achievement of climate
goals]{.underline}, but many of its conditions are also true, in varying
degrees, for¶ other militaries.156 Europe, as a major conglomerate of
military forces and an ally of the US in¶ many wars requires a quick
inspection as well.

### Racial Violence

#### Militarism is inextricably linked to the maintenance and expansion of white supremacy- their call to shore up the US's defense is a racial project to project violence into every pore of American society

Confronting White Supremacy and a Militaristic Pedagogy in the U.S.
Settler Colonial State; Annals of the American Association of
Geographers Volume 106, 2016 - Issue 3

The analytic of [militarism requires first a focus on the United States
as produced through settler colonialism]{.underline} (Morgensen 2011;
Smith 2012; Hixson 2013; Veracini 2013). A. Bonds and Inwood (2015)
explained settler [colonialism]{.underline} as a continuously unfolding
project of empire that [is enabled]{.underline} by and
[through]{.underline} specific **[racial configurations that are tied to
geographies of white supremacy]{.underline}**. In a U.S. context,
[settler colonialism begins with]{.underline} the removal of first
peoples from the land and the creation of racialized and gendered labor
systems that make the land productive for the colonizers. This includes
the removal of Native peoples and geographies of indentured servitude,
slavery, sharecropping, and, more contemporarily, urban abandonment and
practices of mass imprisonment. Settler colonialism, therefore,
emphasizes the ongoing processes of racialized capital accumulation and
displacement necessary to sustain the permanent occupation of a
territory. In this sense, [it is an enduring structure]{.underline}---an
interrelated political, social, and economic process that continuously
unfolds---[requiring continued reconfigurations and
interventions]{.underline} by the state (Wolfe 2006). Because of the
constant reworking of social and political economic hierarchies
necessary to sustain settler relations, [this sociospatial dialectic is
central to understanding how particular place-based configurations of
race, class, ethnicity, and gender come to predominate in the United
States]{.underline} (for a broader discussion see S. Hall 1996; Gilmore
1999; A. Bonds and Inwood 2015). According to Smith (2012), **[settler
colonialism is sustained by three primary logics that enshrine white
supremacy]{.underline}**. [The first]{.underline} of these logics
[is]{.underline} that of [slavery]{.underline}, [which is usually
premised on]{.underline} the enslavement of black people, [the
devaluation of black life]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the
[racialized political economy]{.underline} established through this
system. Rather than being located in the past, the logic of slavery
mutates and mobilizes across time and space, systematized through
various structures of social control that dispossess and retain black
bodies as permanent property of the state. This logic connects slavery,
sharecropping, welfare programs, and mass imprisonment (Smith 2012).
[The logic of slavery rationalizes racial exploitation and is the
cornerstone for the very notion of private property]{.underline}. As
Harris (1993) argued, "The origins of property rights in the United
States are rooted in racial domination" (1734) that is connected to
slavery and gives rise to a very specific form of U.S.-style political
economy built on and through the subordination of persons of color.
Thus, [slavery introduces into the life of the nation the routine and
naturalized "statesanctioned]{.underline} or extralegal production and
[exploitation of group-differentiated vulnerability]{.underline} to
premature death" that is the heart of U.S.-style racism (Gilmore 2007,
28). The associated practices and systems not only justify death as the
"collateral consequences" of U.S. development, but they undergird the
social and premature death of structural racism (Gilmore 2007). [A
second and interconnected logic is genocide, premised on the ongoing
disappearance of indigenous peoples]{.underline} in support of the
appropriation and privatization of indigenous lands (Smith 2012).
[Genocide sustains a spatial politics of erasure]{.underline} and
exclusion, institutionalized by state practices that justify indigenous
removal and settler land claims. The practices of genocide are animated
by and through logics of private property that connect geographies of
indigenous disappearance with labor systems meant to make the land
productive. Finally, [a third pillar is orientalism]{.underline},
**[grounded in the belief of the inferiority and threatening menace of
non-Western nations]{.underline}** and peoples (Smith 2012).1 **[This
introduces into the United States a state of permanent
warfare]{.underline}** in which the nation is consistently besieged by
enemies (externally and internally); [as a consequence, there is a
constant need to protect "the well-being of empire]{.underline}" (Smith
2012, 69). **[The foundational rationales of slavery, genocide, and
orientalism contour the white supremacist settler state]{.underline}**:
The founding moments of US nationalism \[meaning the social and cultural
identity of the nation\] are foundational to both state and culture. The
US was conceived in slavery and christened by genocide. **[These early
practices established high expectations of state aggression against
enemies of the national purpose]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
that **[valorized armed men in uniform as the nation's true sacrificial
subjects]{.underline}**. (Gilmore 2002, 20) **[These logics are
reformulated]{.underline}** and continue to take shape **[in an era of
ostensible color-blindness]{.underline}** predominated by official
discourses and government commitments to racial equality. [Even as overt
racism is eschewed, taken for granted socioeconomic
hierarchies]{.underline}, racial exploitation, and the redistribution of
wealth **[reproduce and sustain white supremacy.]{.underline}** [The
U.S. settler state internalizes a "righteous violence" predicated on an
expanding "quest for total security]{.underline}" that has come to
characterize domestic and foreign policy (Hixson 2013, 198). Although
there are myriad ways to explore the interrelations between
state-sanctioned violence and militarism, [we find the connections
between domestic policing and the U.S. military-industrial complex to be
particularly illustrative]{.underline}. Kraska and Cubellis (1997) noted
that [there is a long history of collusion between the military and
police departments]{.underline} in the United States [and the military
paradigm is an important organizing principle within the development of
modern policing practices]{.underline}, organization, and tactics (e.g.,
Bittner 1970; Manning 1977; Enloe 1980; A. Hall and Coyne 2012). These
practices took on added significance during the latter half of the
twentieth century as U.S. cities faced increased pressure to "get tough
on crime" and as local police departments developed specially trained
tactical teams, commonly referred to as Special Weapons and Tactics
(SWAT) teams (Kraska and Cubellis 1997). [The interactions between the
military and domestic police practices intensified yet again during the
"war on drugs]{.underline}" and in a post--11 September 2001 world where
domestic terror concerns have fueled the explosive growth of military
and police cooperation (A. Hall and Coyne 2012). **[Although ostensibly
unconnected to questions of race and economic inequality, militarism is
fundamentally linked to structural violences of poverty and social
difference]{.underline}** (Loyd 2009, 2014), [and the pursuit of total
security connects settler state militarism across scales, legitimating
the expansion and protection of the nation-state, the policing of its
borders and communities]{.underline}, and internal and external
monitoring and surveillance [in the name of defense]{.underline}.
**[Securing the white supremacist settler state relies on racial,
gender, and class hierarchies that enable the coherence of an imagined
nation with clearly marked inclusions and exclusions]{.underline}**.
That is, [the targeted and widespread violence that characterizes the
U.S. settler state]{.underline}---seen in everything from the genocide
directed toward Native peoples to the criminalization of communities of
color---[depends on and reinforces discursive constructions that
demonize those who stand in the way of the settler state]{.underline}
and, more often than not, culminates in national campaigns against those
beyond the scope of U.S. settler state justice. [The indiscriminate
killing associated with this kind of violence is easily dismissed as an
unfortunate consequence of war]{.underline} (Hixson 2013). U.S.
interventionism relies on a "defensive solidarity . . . built on the
institution of slavery and the racialization of Blackness" that
reaffirms white supremacist cultural identity by managing both internal
and external threats (Loyd 2009, 406). These practices continue even
after the settler state has displaced and "removed" native peoples who
had previously occupied the land, creating political landscapes with an
aggressive propensity for violence (Veracini 2010). [This understanding
of the United States as a settler state is significant for theorizing
militarism]{.underline}, we argue, **[because it situates the persistent
violences of genocide and slavery as enduring structures shaping social
and political economic relations.]{.underline}** Rather than being
projects of the past, **[settler practices are central to the continued
development and futurity of the United States]{.underline}**. A settler
colonial perspective disrupts the spatial imaginaries of war by
emphasizing the ongoing racialized violence necessary to secure
contested, although taken for granted, homelands in settler nations.
Moreover, **[it connects the indiscriminate violence stretching from
U.S. settler colonial history to contemporary military
engagements]{.underline}** (Hixson 2013). As Blackhawk and Apache
helicopters swoop and attack and Tomahawk cruise missiles explode, and
as U.S. Special Forces head into "Indian country" to search and destroy
the enemy, the ramifications and taken for granted sensibilities of
settler geographies become all too clear (Hixson 2013, 198). Hixson
(2013) further clarified, "[American settler colonialism is a
winnertakes- all proposition that demanded the removal of indigenous
peoples and the destruction of their cultures," and these geographies
have "profound consequences for national identity and subsequent
**foreign policy**]{.underline}" (197). **[The settler state is premised
on permanent war, inscribing militarism and violence into everyday
geographies and naturalizing racialized power hierarchies and the
dispossession and erasure of racialized bodies]{.underline}**.

### War/Extinction

#### Militarism causes war, suffering, and deepens inequality -- only understanding militarism's global reach will avert extinction

It goes without saying that [militarism]{.underline}, like its close
siblings¶ capitalism and colonialism, [is deeply imbricated with
suffering¶ and social injustice]{.underline}. While everyone who is not
a pacifist can¶ reference armed struggles they consider for just cause
(from¶ the Sandinistas for some on the left to the Afghan Mujahadeen¶ of
the 1980s for some on the right), [it is the very essence of¶ military
operations that they kill and terrorize people]{.underline}---including,
inevitably, innocent civilians as well as combatants.¶
[Some]{.underline} military operations [exact a higher death
toll]{.underline} than others,¶ and [some are more
discriminate]{.underline} in picking targets than others¶ (and we should
not be dismissive of the importance of these¶ distinctions),
[but]{.underline} it is the lowest common denominator of¶ military
operations that [they all inflict death]{.underline}, injury, and
suffering. [This suffering includes a lingering aftermath to conflict¶
that may take the form of cancer and other ailments]{.underline}
settling¶ into a population [over decades because]{.underline} depleted
uranium¶ weapons, defoliants, heavy metals, solvents, and other
**[toxins¶ were released in war or preparation for war]{.underline}**;
or it may take the¶ form of elevated rates of suicide, drug addiction,
alcoholism,¶ and spousal abuse among mentally and spiritually injured¶
veterans. And, [even when military forces are not used in war,¶ there is
a high incidence of]{.underline} prostitution, [violence]{.underline}
against women,¶ and damage to public health and the environment
[around]{.underline} military [bases]{.underline} (Lutz 2001; McCaffrey
2002; Vine 2015).18 Essays in¶ this volume by Lutz (2019) and Vine
(2019) explore this kind of¶ damage with nuance and precision. Moreover,
**[the ways military spending is directed tend to reinforce and deepen
social¶ inequalities]{.underline}**, [enriching]{.underline} senior
[executives and stockholders]{.underline} of¶ large military contractors
such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing,¶ BAE Systems, General Dynamics,
Dyncorp, and CACI [as well¶ as]{.underline} the penumbral swarm of
retired military officers and highpriced consultants who provision them
with advice, ["studies,"¶ and lobbying services]{.underline}. It should
come as no surprise that¶ [macroeconomic analysis has found a clear
correlation between¶ high levels of military spending and high levels of
social inequality]{.underline} (Abell 1994; Ali 2007). Seen in this
light [it is]{.underline} surely [of]{.underline}¶ the [utmost
concern]{.underline} that global military spending continues to¶ rise
and **[that processes of militarization reach ever more deeply¶ into
social and cultural life]{.underline}**---from Hollywood movies to
children's toys and video game design (Allen 2017; Cheng 2013;¶ Enloe
2000a, 2000b; Gibson 1994; Jauregui 2015).¶ Much anthropological writing
on militarism, imbued with¶ anthropology's traditional preferential
option for the poor and¶ marginalized, emphasizes the suffering
militarism leaves in its¶ wake. However, some ethnographers have studied
up or sideways (Stryker and Gonzalez 2014) to understand the
perspectives of actors inside militarist organizations, and some
strands¶ in the literature on the anthropology of militarism make
descriptively real, for example, the aesthetic beauty soldiers and¶
weapons designers see in weapons, the threats soldiers and¶ planners
fear, or the felt righteousness of the causes for which¶ warriors fight.
In this volume Weiss (2019) provides a complex¶ evocation of the
contradictions and ambivalent feelings experienced by Israeli soldiers
rebelling against their expected role in¶ the subjugation and occupation
of the Palestinian community.¶ Analyses such as Weiss's provide a
much-needed window into¶ the lived experience of militarist actors,
challenging anthropologists to empathize with their dilemmas rather than
just¶ condemning them. Anthropology cannot produce a complete¶
descriptive analysis of militarism without exploring the experience and
cultural logics of soldiers, weapons scientists, and¶ intelligence
officers---perhaps anthropology's ultimate others---¶ as well as
militarism's victims. This raises problems of method¶ and writing. How
do anthropologists study people who may not¶ want to be studied or are
for other reasons inaccessible for¶ conventional fieldwork? This may
involve defetishizing participant observation in favor of a mixed-method
approach that¶ gives more weight to textual sources and set-piece
interviews of¶ the kind journalists practice. And, when it comes to
writing,¶ how do we write critically about militarist actors without
leaving¶ our subjects (as well as some of our readers) feeling set up
and¶ betrayed? Alternatively, how do we convey the cultural sense of¶
militarist practices and institutions without feeling complicit¶
(Gusterson 1997)?19¶ Militarism's Global Web¶ This volume goes to print
at a moment when [military programs¶ continue to enjoy]{.underline}
strong public [support]{.underline} in the United States¶ **[despite the
fact that militarist processes have set entire regions of¶ the
planet]{.underline}** (especially in the Middle East and the Horn of
Africa)¶ **[ablaze]{.underline}**. According to Brown University's Costs
of War project¶ (http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/) the [US
interventions]{.underline} in¶ Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan [have led
to at least 370,000 direct deaths and 800,000 indirect
deaths]{.underline}, have [displaced over¶ 10 million
people]{.underline}, and have so far cost US taxpayers \$5.6 trillion.¶
If we then consider the conflict in [Syria]{.underline}, that [adds
another¶ 350,000--500,000 deaths]{.underline} and, astoundingly, over 6
million more¶ refugees. And then there are the conflicts in Somalia,
Yemen,¶ and Libya, which have killed and displaced many more. And,¶
while [the numbers]{.underline} are horrifying enough, they **[do not
begin to¶ speak to other dimensions of suffering and
destruction]{.underline}** associated with the sundering of families,
the trauma of witnessing¶ relentless, organized violence for years, and
the hopelessness¶ that comes from watching the collapse of social
institutions.¶ From our perspective as analysts of militarism, **[these
conflict]{.underline}**s¶ in different countries, **[which tend to be
reported separately]{.underline}** in¶ the media, **[are coproduced by a
single bundle of underlying¶ militarist processes and are integrated
with one another, no¶ matter how much local dynamics may
vary]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[this is the¶ essence of
militarism]{.underline}**---**[its ability to be simultaneously local
and¶ global,]{.underline}** [to connect different geographical spaces
and meaning¶ systems]{.underline} through organized violence or the
preparation for it,¶ **[while obscuring the workings of the connective
circuitry.]{.underline}** [The¶ conflicts that appear to be "in" the
Middle East, but that are¶ really global]{.underline} in their reach and
origins[, are simultaneously¶ "about"]{.underline} Sunni-Shi'a
[hostility]{.underline} in local Iraqi neighborhoods, the¶
[rivalry]{.underline} between Pashtuns and Tajiks in Afghanistan,
jihadists'¶ dreams of a new Caliphate, the diaspora's fantasies
of"home," a[¶ "clash of civilizations" in the heads of American
neoconservatives]{.underline}, human rights hawks' claims to want to
protect Muslim¶ women's rights, [military planners' search for pipeline
routes¶ and geostrategic advantage]{.underline}, US presidents'
[anxieties about reelection]{.underline}, [and aerospace executives'
drive for increased profits.¶]{.underline} Barefoot guerillas in the
Hindu Kush, suicide bombers in Mosul,¶ US special [forces]{.underline}
knocking down doors in the middle of the¶ night, drone operators in
Nevada, bemedaled generals in the¶ Pentagon, speakers in suits at
Washington think tanks, refugees¶ clinging to flimsy boats in the
Mediterranean, and assembly line¶ workers churning out ammunition for
M16s may never meet¶ one another but **[are fundamentally joined by
processes of mil¶ itarism that adhere to certain
patterns]{.underline}**: through a process of¶ polarization, **[they
create and intensify enmities]{.underline}**, turning neighbors against
one another; **[they create novel alliances between¶ locals and
outsiders;]{.underline}** they inject weaponry beyond the normal¶ reach
of local fighters; [and they spread]{.underline}, through a sort of
process¶ of contagion, exporting violence to and bringing weapons and¶
fighters from contiguous territories and diasporic communities.¶ Above
all, following global capitalist and colonial pathways that¶ have
sedimented over centuries, [they tend to transmogrify the¶ bodily
suffering and death of those in the periphery into wealth¶ in the
metropole]{.underline}: jobs in munitions factories or in the
everexpanding US Department of Defense, profits for shareholders¶ in
arms manufacturers, book contracts for defense intellectuals,¶ and roles
for actors in Hollywood war movies. This is not to say¶ that no one in
the metropole suffers and dies, but [militarism is a¶ global system that
is tilted in favor of the West,]{.underline} which profits¶ from
suffering beyond its borders.¶ A number of commentators observed that,
after World¶ War II, Western societies failed to demobilize as they had
after¶ World War I, and that the world was increasingly in a permanent
war orientation: military research and development¶ continued; the arms
industry remained a leading sector in the¶ economy; nuclear weapons were
placed on hair-trigger alert,¶ and the horizon was constantly scanned
for incoming missiles;¶ the United States built a global network of
hundreds of military¶ bases, while both superpowers used military aid to
build global¶ patron-client networks; the United States and the Soviet
Union¶ used their military and intelligence forces to intervene in
other¶ countries' affairs; and conflicts, invariably worsened by
superpower sponsorship of contending factions, regularly erupted in¶ the
global south. Far from ameliorating this situation, [the end of¶ the
cold war has,]{.underline} in the context of a struggle for resource
access¶ in the global south and the emergence of the so-called war on¶
terror, **[produced a further intensification of militarism, which¶ has
morphed opportunistically as it has adapted to new
economic]{.underline}**, ideological, and strategic
**[realities]{.underline}**. **[If, instead of focusing¶ on particular
conflicts, we try to hold in awareness the system of¶ global militarism
in its entirety, we see a system that generates¶ expansionary energy
from its own internal conflicts]{.underline}**: **[as actors¶ within the
system argue that threats from elsewhere within the¶ system justify the
accumulation of weaponry, the use of force, or¶ the further
securitization of daily life, the system deepens its grip¶ upon
us]{.underline}** To make this case is to recapitulate an argument made
by the¶ great social historian E. P. Thompson (1980) in a much debated¶
essay on "exterminism, the last stage of civilization." Analyzing¶ the
cold war nuclear arms race, Thompson argued that Western¶ and Eastern
bloc critiques of the other bloc seemed, in their own¶ context,
progressive, but, seen from outside the entire conflict,¶ merely served
to consolidate and expand the underlying system,¶ which he dubbed
"exterminism." He reframed democratic capitalism and communism not as
contending systems but as complementary components of this exterminist
system. Looking¶ forward, he feared that **[this system could only be
ended in a¶ self-destructive genocidal spasm as its own contradictions
became inescapable]{.underline}**. [The question before us now is
whether exterminist militarism might be ended otherwise]{.underline},
slowly rolled¶ back (as slavery and colonialism were) through the
combined¶ efforts of intellectuals, institutions, and social movements.¶
**[Until we recognize militarism for what it is, we cannot begin to¶
roll it back]{.underline}**.

#### Prioritizing everyday violence is key- responding to it later causes error replication and movement burn out, only re-orienting focus away from macro-level violence produces sustainable political coalitions

**Cuomo '96**

(Chris, Prof. of Political Science @ U of Cincinnati, "War is not just
an event: reflections on the significance of everyday violence",
Hypatia, vol. 11, no. 4 Fall (1994))

[Theory that does not investigate]{.underline} or even notice [the
omnipresence of militarism cannot]{.underline} represent or [address the
depth]{.underline} and specificity [of]{.underline} the [everyday
effects of militarism]{.underline} on women, on people living in
occupied territories, on members of military institutions, and on the
environment. [These effects]{.underline} are relevant to feminists in a
number of ways because military practices and institutions help
construct gendered and national identity, and because they [justify the
destruction of natural nonhuman entities and communities during
peacetime]{.underline}. Lack of attention to these aspects of the
business of making or preventing military violence in an extremely
technologized world results in theory that cannot accommodate the
connections among the constant presence of militarism, declared wars,
and other closely related social phenomena, such as nationalistic
glorifications of motherhood, media violence, and current ideological
gravitations to military solutions for social problems. [Ethical
approaches that do not attend to the ways in which warfare]{.underline}
and military practices [are woven into the]{.underline} very [fabric of
life]{.underline} in twenty-first century technological states [lead to
crisis-based politics and analyses]{.underline}. For any feminism that
aims to resist oppression and create alternative social and political
options, [crisis-based]{.underline} ethics and [politics are problematic
because they distract attention from the need for sustained resistance
to]{.underline} the [enmeshed]{.underline}, omnipresent [systems of
domination]{.underline} and oppression that so often function as givens
in most people\'s lives. [Neglecting the omnipresence of militarism
allows the false belief that the absence of declared armed conflicts is
peace]{.underline}, the polar opposite of war. [It is particularly easy
for those whose lives are shaped by]{.underline} the safety of
[privilege]{.underline}, and who do not regularly encounter the
realities of militarism, to maintain this false belief. The belief that
militarism is an ethical, political concern only regarding armed
conflict, creates forms of resistance to militarism that are merely
exercises in crisis control. Antiwar [resistance is then mobilized when
the \"real\" violence finally occurs, or when]{.underline} the stability
of [privilege is]{.underline} directly [threatened]{.underline}, [and at
that point it is difficult not to respond in ways that make resisters
drop all other political priorities]{.underline}. [Crisis-driven
attention]{.underline} to declarations of war might actually [keep
resisters complacent]{.underline} about and complicitous in the general
presence of global militarism. [Seeing war as necessarily
embedded]{.underline} in constant military presence [draws attention to
the fact that horrific]{.underline}, state-sponsored [violence is
happening nearly all over]{.underline}, all of the time, and that it is
perpetrated by military institutions and other militaristic agents of
the state.

### Turns Case- SPF

#### The aff's solvency rests on the promise of 'restabilizing' the future- it ignores that the socio-economic contradictions that created the crisis are inevitable- the result is a suture of the system that forecloses change and ensures serial policy failure

Peter **Bloom in 2016**

Open University Business School, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK;
Back to the capitalist future: Fantasy and the

paradox of crisis; Culture and Organization, 22:2, 158-177, DOI:
10.1080/14759551.2014.897347

Yet these [leaders' responses also bear witness to a certain
contradiction implicit in]{.underline}¶ the [naming]{.underline} of [an
event as a crisis]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} simultaneously [speaks
to the need for transformation¶ and the desire for
stability]{.underline}. Indeed, **[the uncertainty surrounding this near
catastrophe¶ was assuaged through the trumpeting of the ability of
elites to 'solve']{.underline}** and¶ 'fix' **[the problem and in doing
so return to a state of 'normalcy']{.underline}**. George W. Bush¶ thus
stated optimistically in late 2008 that whereas 'this problem did not
develop overnight¶ and it will not be solved overnight', nevertheless,
'with continued cooperation¶ and determination it will be solved' (BBC
News, 15 November 2008). Illustrating the¶ global reach of this
discourse Yi Gang, deputy governor of the People's Bank of¶ China (the
Chinese central bank), promised that his country would 'actively
participate¶ in rescue activities for this international financial
crisis' (BBC News, 15 November¶ 2008).¶ [This longing for]{.underline}
renewed security, for **[the problem to be 'solved', plays into the¶
rearticulation of 'crisis' as an element of a broader fantasmatic
narrative of recovery]{.underline}**.¶ **[Fundamental to
this]{.underline}** narrative **[framing]{.underline}** **[is the
characterizing of these dislocating¶ events as markedly different than
the stable period preceding them,]{.underline}** [thus opening the¶ way
for]{.underline} the promotion of the possibility of 'recovery' and
consequently [the ability to¶ recapture the subjective security
associated with a less anxious time prior to the¶ crisis]{.underline}.
More precisely, **[these discourses promoting 'recovery' are symptomatic
of the¶ attempt to construct a new beatific discourse promising
individuals uncertain over¶ their future the ability to 'recapture'
their former stability]{.underline}** as social subjects.¶ The immediate
responses to the crisis illustrate this phenomenon. A continual¶ refrain
from elites following the meltdown were themes not of transformation
but¶ recovery. This emphasis was apparent in newly elected President
Obama's February¶ 2009 address to a joint session of congress. After
acknowledging that 'the impact of¶ this recession is real, and it is
everywhere' he strikes a triumphant tone stressing the¶ nation's
inherent capacity to 'recover':¶ But while our economy may be weakened
and our confidence shaken, though we are¶ living through difficult and
uncertain times, tonight I want every American to know¶ this, We will
rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge
stronger¶ than before. (Obama 2009a)¶ Whereas this triumphant rhetoric
is perhaps to be expected by any incoming leader¶ faced with the
daunting task of confronting massive socio-economic problems, what¶ is
of interest is the framing of such optimism around the promises of
recovery. **[The¶ ringing pledge that 'we will rebuild' and 'we will
recover' contains within it an assumption¶ that current troubles are
temporary and ultimately exceptional rather than reflective¶ of deeper
and more fundamental problems with contemporary
capitalism]{.underline}**.¶ Through this fantasy, [the crisis was
changed from a threatening encounter with the¶ 'real' to a more
manageable ideological 'reality' linked to romanticized themes of¶
recovery and future progress.]{.underline} This narrative of crisis was
on full display in the aftermath¶ of the events of 2008. In Obama's
2009, State of the Union, he proclaims¶ The answers to our problems
don't lie beyond our reach. They exist in our laboratories¶ and our
universities; in our fields and our factories; in the imaginations of
our entrepreneurs.¶ What is required now is for this country to pull
together, confront boldly the challenges¶ we face, and take
responsibility for our future once more. (Obama 2009b)¶ [The
articulation of these events as a 'crisis' then served ironically as a
force for subjects¶ to once again stabilize their identity. The
narrativizing of this event as a temporary aberration¶ lent itself to
the proffering of an idealized vision of the future emphasizing¶ themes
of 'stability']{.underline} and 'normalization'. Reflected, in this
respect, was the ideological¶ paradox of crisis -- where **[the failure
of an ideology is transformed into an opportunity¶ for re-identification
and potential ideological renewal]{.underline}**.

## Alts/Framework

### Alt- Critical Peace Research

#### The alternative is critical peace research, a strategy that continuously critiques and questions sovereign conceptions of violence and peace while simultaneously committing to the ethical and practical imperative of non-violent resistance to structures of domination. 

**Jackson 15 -- prof of peace and conflict studies @ U of Otago**

(Richard, 'Towards critical peace research: Lessons from critical
terrorism studies,' chapter in *Researching Terrorism, Peace and
Conflict Studies: Interaction, synthesis, and opposition*, edited by
Ioannis Tellidis and Harmonie Toros, pp. 24-31)

[Critical peace research]{.underline}: a proposal On the basis of the
above assessment, this section briefly outlines a set of core
commitments which I believe ought to characterise CPR. I conceive of
'critical' (peace) research in two primary senses. First, it simply
means an intellectual orientation or attitude which attempts to stand
apart from the existing order (while at the same time acknowledging that
one can never fully escape one's own situatedness or biases), which
[questions widely accepted common- sense and dominant forms of knowledge
about peace and conflict, and]{.underline} which [asks probing questions
about **how existing social and epistemic orders came into existence**
and the processes by which they are maintained]{.underline}. Second, and
more narrowly, the term 'critical' is used to refer to approaches which
draw upon the analytical tools and insights of Frankfurt School-
inspired Critical Theory, as well as related critical-normative social
theories and disciplinary approaches such as critical constructivism,
post- structuralism, feminism, post- colonialism and others. In the
first instance, critical approaches are [characterised by a **healthy
scepticism** towards accepted knowledge claims]{.underline} and dominant
ideas, [and instead, seek to **continuously question and
interrogate**]{.underline} that which is taken for granted. In
particular, [critical scholars are committed to interrogating how the
status quo is implicated in some of the very problems that traditional
theory seeks to solve, in this case, the 'problems' of conflict,
violence]{.underline}, lack of reconciliation and the like. In part,
this is because critical approaches recognise that knowledge and power
are intimately connected-- that knowledge is never neutral, but 'theory
is always for someone and for some purpose' (Cox 1981). Lastly, [in
contrast to the social scientific adoption of a **purportedly neutral
standpoint** on political and ethical issues, critical approaches are
characterised by an **openly ethical- normative commitment**
to]{.underline} human rights, [social justice, progressive politics, and
improving the lives of individuals and communities -- or what is often
called 'emancipation' or praxis]{.underline} (McDonald 2009).
[**Ontological commitments** What exactly are the things called
'conflict', 'peace', 'violence', 'terrorism',]{.underline} 'mediation',
'reconciliation' [and the like]{.underline}, that we study, [and how
should we conceive, understand and speak of them?]{.underline} An openly
critical approach would suggest that all of [these objects of study are
not free- standing, ontologically distinct phenomena discoverable by
**objective social scientific study**]{.underline}. [Instead, things
like 'peace', 'humanitarian intervention', 'cultural violence' or
'reconciliation' are social formations and sets of social activities
that are]{.underline} in large part **[contingent upon, and constituted
by, the]{.underline}** terms, languages and [**discourses** used to
describe and study them]{.underline}. [A concept like 'peace'
is]{.underline} actually 'an **[ontologically suspicious]{.underline}**
concept' (Elshtain quoted in Neufeld 1993: 172), and whether a
particular society is described as 'peaceful', 'post- conflict',
'reconciled', or 'violent' is not a value- free fact or 'truth' waiting
to be discovered by a scholar through the scientific method, but the
consequence of the operation of a series of academic, political and
social discourses, judgements and practices in different locales. In
other words, [there is a discursive, political, cultural and academic
process by which real world actors and processes are given meaning
through]{.underline} the negotiated application of different kinds of
[political and intellectual labels, categories and narratives,
including]{.underline} a set of [discursively constructed **measures by
which 'peacefulness' or 'violence' can be ranked**]{.underline}, or
groups judged to be 'spoilers', for example. [Such measurements are
**inherently ideological** in that they **prioritise some values over
others: direct violence over structural violence, order over social
justice**]{.underline}, dialogue over resistance. Moreover, [such
labels, concepts, categories and meanings are prone to **change and
contestation**]{.underline}; they never just 'speak for themselves'. In
terms of exactly what a 'conflict' consists of, for example, something
that started as a 'rebellion' might then become a 'terrorist campaign'
(or 'The troubles'), before being designated a 'civil war' (usually, by
virtue of reaching an arbitrary fatality threshold), a 'genocide' or a
'counter-insurgency campaign'. [This is not to say that critical
approaches do not recognise actual physical violence in the 'real world'
which is experienced]{.underline} by people [as 'civil war' or
'terrorism', or conditions of low direct violence which is understood as
'peace'. Rather,]{.underline} it is to adopt a Frankfurt School-
inspired ontology which maintains a 'minimal foundationalism' in which
the ontological distinction between subject and object is preserved, and
[discourse and materiality are conceptualised as **shaping each other in
a dialectical, never-ceasing dynamic**, rather than the one being solely
constituted by the other]{.underline} (Toros and Gunning 2009). Such an
ontological standpoint recognizes that there are observable
'regularities' in human activity (what positivists might call laws), and
that one can distinguish between different phenomena on the basis of
their delineated characteristics, while at the same time recognising
that these characteristics and how they are interpreted are a product of
their social and historical context and thus, are not 'objective facts'
in the positivist sense. Consequently, for critical scholars, the
acceptance of the relative ontological insecurity of analytical concepts
results in a real sensitivity to the politics of labelling and
categorising, and extreme care in the use of different terms during
research and teaching. However, critical approaches go even further,
recognising that [peace, conflict, violence, reconciliation and the like
are in themselves **constituted by social and political narratives,
discourses and practices**]{.underline}. As a consequence, critical
scholars are interested in the constitutive nature of norms, ideas and
other discursive elements which make the social practices of conflict,
violence, dialogue, peace and reconciliation possible in specific
historical and spatial contexts (Alkopher 2005: 716). In other words,
critical approaches suggest that [violent conflict cannot be fully
understood apart from the particular kinds of narratives, discourses and
social practices which **make it possible by rendering it conceivable,
legitimate and reasonable**]{.underline} (see Jabri 1996). Crucial to
this process is the role played by existing normative structures which
function to construct identities, interests and modes of social action
(Alkopher 2005: 720). Importantly, in addition to critical civil war
research (see Jackson 2014) within the conflict analysis side of the
field, a critical ontology which accepts the social construction and
inherent instability of the key concepts is also starting to inform
approaches to the study of peace (Richmond 2007, Shinko 2008) and
conflict resolution (Hansen 2008), among others. **[Epistemological
commitments]{.underline}** A critical epistemology accepts that creating
[knowledge is ultimately a social process which depends on a range of
contextual and process- related factors,]{.underline} not least the
social position of the researcher, the institutional context within
which they conduct their research, and the kinds of methods they employ.
[Such factors impact on the kinds of knowledge produced, as well as the
purposes to which it is ultimately put. Importantly, this **does not
mean that all knowledge about the social world is hopelessly insecure**,
that]{.underline} scholarly standards and procedures in [research should
be rejected]{.underline}, or that 'anchorages' -- relatively secure
knowledge claims -- cannot be found and built upon (Booth 2008).
[Rather, it suggests]{.underline} that CPR should be characterised by [a
**continuous and critical reflexivity** in regards to]{.underline} its
own [epistemology, methodology and assumptions.]{.underline} It also
means that [there are few if any knowledge claims about conflict,
violence, peace]{.underline}, reconciliation and the like [that cannot
be challenged or questioned]{.underline}. Related to this, a critical
perspective also recognises that [no individual]{.underline}, including
academic researchers, [can]{.underline} completely [put aside their
personal **identity, values, perceptions, and world view**]{.underline}
and then engage in purely objective, dispassionate, value- free
research. Rather, every researcher brings with them a particular culture
and set of values and understandings which shapes their research in
important ways. At the very least, critical scholars argue that
[recognising and acknowledging]{.underline} the [personal
subjectivity]{.underline} of the researcher [is an important
step]{.underline} (see Breen Smyth 2009), [not least because such
continuous reflexivity acts as an antidote to the **dangerous claim that
some kinds of knowledge are objective**]{.underline} and wholly
unbiased, [**and therefore superior** to others.]{.underline} Crucially,
such an epistemological stance does not entail a wholesale rejection of
the social scientific notion of objectivity, but instead accepts that
[there are multiple ways of knowing about]{.underline} objects of social
analysis, such as [conflicts or peace]{.underline} processes, that [it
is]{.underline} in any case [beyond the capacity of any single narrative
to provide the best account of such processes]{.underline}, and that
through a pluralisation of perspectives and their inevitable clashes a
more justifiable knowledge can be assembled (see Campbell 1998:
279--281). A critical approach therefore suggests that '[**continual
contestation**, rather than]{.underline} the aspirations of [synthesis
and totality, should be the aim of inquiry']{.underline} (ibid.: 281).
[A third important]{.underline} epistemological [stance is a deep
awareness of the]{.underline} linkages between power and knowledge,
particularly in terms of the different [ways in which knowledge can be
employed by actors as a political tool of influence and
domination]{.underline}. For example, critical scholars are sceptical of
the way in which [certain kinds of knowledge claims about peace and
conflict -- for example, that movements who resist and contest
neoliberalism]{.underline} or reject dialogue [are]{.underline} by
definition ['spoilers',]{.underline} or that dialogue is an inherent
social good, [or **that neo- liberal peacebuilding leads inevitably to
'peace**' -- have been **used by governments and international
organisations to de- legitimise**]{.underline} certain kinds of
**[struggles and support]{.underline}** certain kinds [of]{.underline}
**[externally imposed 'solutions']{.underline}** (see Duffield 2001).
[Consequently, critical scholars begin by asking: Who is peace and
conflict research for? How does peace research support particular
interests?]{.underline} What are the ideological effects of peace
research, particularly on those societies being studied? Another
important epistemological issue for CPR is the notion of categories and
how they are applied, particularly in research on political violence,
peace, reconciliation and the like (Jackson et al. 2011: 158--164).
While categories can be very useful for understanding complex realities
and uncovering salient aspects of a particular phenomenon, they are at
the same time profoundly problematic. In particular, critical scholars
are concerned that when typologies are presented as universally
applicable, without recognition of the specific power- knowledge
structures in which they emerged and which sustain them, they can
function as a tool of ideology, in part through their assumptions of
'sameness' and 'otherness', and their reliance on presumed essences and
binary differences. As Foucault (1970) argues in The Order of Things, at
their root, orders or categories are never natural or objective, but
part of a political- historical structure. In contrast, critical
scholars do not view their categories as timeless or universal, but as
products of a particular set of power structures and their regimes. As
such, they should be continuously interrogated, their boundaries,
dichotomies and causal implications problematised, and their political
and ideological effects exposed. This has certainly been the case by CTS
scholars in the terrorism field (see Jackson et al. 2011).
Methodological commitments The ontological and epistemological
commitments outlined thus far have a number of important specific
consequences for method and research practice. First, [critical scholars
are committed to transparency about their own values and
standpoints]{.underline}, particularly as they relate to the interests
and values of the societies in which they live and work. [For Western-
based scholars, this translates into an abiding commitment to being
aware of, and trying to overcome, the Eurocentric, Orientalist, and
patriarchal forms of knowledge often prevalent within Peace Studies,
Security Studies, IR, and other areas of social science more
generally]{.underline} (see Henderson 2013; Toros and Gunning 2009).
Related to this, [critical scholars are committed to **taking
subjectivity seriously**]{.underline}, in terms of both the researcher
and the research subject (Dauphinee 2007). This means being aware of,
and transparent about, the values and impact of the researcher on the
process and outcomes of the research, and [being willing to seriously
engage with **the viewpoint and perceptions of the Other**]{.underline},
particularly those [who have been demonised or silenced in]{.underline}
broader peace and [security discourses]{.underline}. As Jutila, Pehkonen
and Vayrynen (2008: 628) put it, the peace researcher 'should enter into
the life- worlds of the groups she or he studies before venturing to
write about them'. [Another commitment]{.underline} of a critical
approach [is to methodological and disciplinary pluralism]{.underline}
-- a willingness to embrace the insights and perspectives of different
academic disciplines, intellectual approaches, and schools of thought.
In particular, [critical scholars see value in]{.underline} post-
positivist and [non- IR-based methods and approaches]{.underline}, such
as discourse analysis, post-structuralism, constructivism, Critical
Theory, historical materialism, history, ethnography and others. In one
respect, [this means **refusing to be limited by the narrow logic of
normal social scientific explanation based on linear notions of cause
and effect**]{.underline}. [Instead, a critical perspective argues that
adopting an **interpretive 'logic of understanding'** rooted in **'how
possible' rather than 'what causes'** questions, can open space for
**subjects, perspectives and affective forms of understanding that are
often foreclosed by traditional social science**]{.underline} (see Doty
1993). [A final important]{.underline} methodological [commitment
is]{.underline} a permanent adherence [to]{.underline} a set of
responsible research ethics which [take account of the]{.underline}
various [**end- users** of peace and conflict research,
including]{.underline} informants, the [communities from which
insurgents or rebels come,]{.underline} vulnerable populations like
[refugees or child soldiers, and]{.underline} the [populations who bear
the brunt of counter- insurgency campaigns or peacebuilding
programmes]{.underline} -- as well as the wider public, other academics,
and policymakers. [More concretely, this means '**recognising the human
behind the label**']{.underline} (Booth 2008: 73), [identifying
marginalised and silenced voices, the adoption of a 'do no harm'
approach]{.underline}, operating transparently as a researcher,
**[recognising]{.underline}** the different kinds of
**[vulnerability]{.underline}** of those being researched, honouring
undertakings of confidentiality and protecting interviewees, utilising
principles of informed consent, and taking responsibility for the
anticipated impact of research and the ways in which it may be utilised
(Breen Smyth 2009). A critical praxis of peace research Simultaneous
with the ontological, epistemological and methodological commitments
described above, CPR is rooted in a broad but clear set of ethical-
normative and praxiological commitments. These commitments are based
first and foremost on the recognition that '[no reality transforms
itself ']{.underline} (Freire 1993: 53); rather, [human agents must
engage in critical interventions -- critical praxis -- in order to
transform oppression]{.underline}. Related to [this]{.underline}, it [is
based on the acceptance of the **inherently degenerate and harmful
nature of all forms of structural, cultural and direct
violence.**]{.underline} Consequently, [critical research]{.underline}
implicitly and [explicitly questions]{.underline} both [the ways in
which **dominant Western narratives** have constructed]{.underline}
their own practices of war and humanitarian intervention as
[**legitimate violence**, and the **power structures, practices and
narratives**]{.underline} in the Western- dominated status quo [**which
make direct and structural violence possible** -- including narratives
of]{.underline} 'new barbarism', ethnic essentialism, [worthy and
unworthy victims, 'good wars', democratic peace, peacebuilding and the
instrumental rationality of legitimate political violence]{.underline}
(see Jabri 1996). More specifically, [a critical approach involves **a
shift from state- centrism and**]{.underline} making state [**security
and system stability** the central concern, to a focus on
the]{.underline} security, **[freedom, and well- being of human
individuals and communities]{.underline}**. [Critical
scholars]{.underline} tend to prioritise human security and societal
security over national security, and they are **[committed to minimizing
all forms of physical, structural, and cultural violence]{.underline}**
(Toros and Gunning 2009), [including that which results from states and
international organisations]{.underline}, and from practices [such as
humanitarian intervention, diplomacy, peacebuilding, and the
like.]{.underline} Importantly, [this means abandoning]{.underline} the
established conflict resolution norm of [neutrality]{.underline} in
conflict resolution practice, [because 'a neutral stance, without an
analysis of power]{.underline} between the parties in conflict, [can
**obfuscate the power differential**]{.underline} that exists between
parties in conflict [and actually **undermine the efforts of oppressed
people** by tacitly or explicitly **supporting the prevailing ideology
and social order** oppressing them']{.underline} (Hansen 2008: 412).
Third- party [neutrality]{.underline}, in this context, [functions to
reinforce the status quo and unwittingly oppress]{.underline} the very
[people]{.underline} they are serving. Related to this, [CPR takes
seriously the scholarly and practical **exploration of non- violent
resistance**]{.underline} and agonistic dialogue [as practical
alternatives to]{.underline} both legitimate and illegitimate forms of
[political violence]{.underline}. Importantly, this entails the adoption
of an explicitly critical approach to conflict resolution practice,
whether it is third- party peacemaking or peacekeeping (Pugh 2004, 2005)
during the open conflict stage, or stabilisation and peacebuilding (Mac
Ginty 2012a) during the post- conflict stage. In either case, [CPR
entails a **commitment to non-violent alternatives**]{.underline} to the
use of military force, **[local ownership and empowerment, resistance to
oppression, the priority of social justice, the transformation of
structures of structural and cultural violence (which may therefore
entail the rejection of neo- liberal economic and political
forms),]{.underline}** and agonistic forms of politics. [Critical
scholars are committed to engaging]{.underline} equally with [both
policy-makers]{.underline} -- the officials who have to make policies to
deal with conflict and violence -- [and policy- takers -- the groups and
wider societies who have to bear the brunt of]{.underline} humanitarian
intervention, [neo- liberal peacebuilding policies or other peace
efforts. Engaging with policy- takers **lessens the risk of co-
option**]{.underline} by the status quo, particularly if those thus
engaged include members of communities labelled as 'protestors',
'activists', 'rebels', 'insurgents' or even 'terrorists'. However, to be
effective in realising the potential for positive change within the
status quo, critical scholars must simultaneously strive to engage with
those who are embedded in the state, international officials, and so on.
[Collectively, this set of commitments -- to **human security over state
security**]{.underline}, to ending avoidable suffering, [to **minimising
and questioning all forms of violence**, to continuous immanent
critique]{.underline}, including conflict resolution practice, [and to
**positively transforming existing structures, including neo- liberal
capitalism** -- can be described as a broad commitment to]{.underline}
the notion of **[emancipation]{.underline}** (see Jackson et al. 2009:
226--227), [or what Freire]{.underline} (1993: 66) [more simply calls
**'the ontological and historical vocation of becoming more fully
human.'**]{.underline} Despite objections to the term and its past
implication in violent hegemonic projects, [critical
scholars]{.underline} for the most part [see emancipation as a process
of trying to construct **'concrete utopias'** by]{.underline} realising
the unfulfilled potential of existing structures, freeing individuals
from unnecessary structural constraints, and the democratisation of the
public sphere (Wyn Jones 2004: 229--232). Importantly, emancipation
should be seen as [a **continuous process of struggle and critique
rather than any particular endpoint or universal grand
narrative.**]{.underline} Critical pedagogy Lastly, given the importance
and centrality of teaching to Peace Studies, I would argue that CPR is
openly committed to critical pedagogy (Freire 1993; see also Hansen
2008). [Such a commitment is rooted in an understanding that teaching
can never be neutral;]{.underline} instead, '[education either functions
as an instrument]{.underline} that is used [to facilitate]{.underline}
the integration of the younger generation into the present system and
bring about **[conformity]{.underline}** to it, **[or]{.underline}** it
becomes . . . the means by which men and women . . . discover how to
participate in the [**transformation** of their world']{.underline}
(Shaull 1993: 34; original emphasis). In other words, [**instead of
problem- solving education,** CPR ought to be oriented towards a kind of
'**problem- posing education'** in which '**students learn to
deconstruct the societal ideology affecting them in their everyday
lives**]{.underline}, see how it inhibits attainment of their interests,
and visualize possible societal changes that could better serve their
interests' (Hansen 2008: 408). [This]{.underline} necessarily [entails
**providing students with a language and set of conceptual tools** for
understanding the 'problematics of power]{.underline}, agency, and
history' (Macedo 1993: 17), [and]{.underline} for [developing
appropriate modes of resistance and emancipatory action]{.underline}.
[Such forms of critical pedagogy are **inherently
praxiological**]{.underline} [because 'when individuals reach critical
consciousness, it allows them to become subjects in their world,
actively and consciously co- creating it, rather than passive "objects"
who accept their social reality']{.underline} (ibid.). From one vantage
point, it also means accepting that 'education is . . . a subversive
force' (Shaull 1993: 29), and **[the goal of teaching is]{.underline}**
in part **[to radicalise the student]{.underline}** [because 'the more
radical the person is, the more fully he or she enters into reality so
that, knowing it better, he or she can better transform it']{.underline}
(Freire 1993: 39). Clearly, at the present juncture, such a critical
pedagogy is far removed from the current teaching of Peace Studies,
which is largely focused on abstract theorising, (positivist)
methodological training, the accumulated empirical findings of the
field, inter- personal conflict resolution skills transfers, and the
like.

### Alt- Structural criticism

#### Beginning with a widened structural criticism of militarism is a pre-requisite to effective critical ethico-political interventions -- voting aff crowds out critical readings of militarism 

**Eastwood, 18** -- James, Professor in the School of Politics and IR at
the University of London. "Rethinking militarism as ideology: The
critique of violence after security," *Security Dialogue*, Vol. 49 (1-2)
-- Special issue on Militarism and security: Dialogue, possibilities and
limits. 44-- 56, doi: 10.1177/0967010617730949, p. 52-54 -- KLab

[The range of critical security studies literatures calling for
desecuritization]{.underline} therefore [do not yet offer a full account
of militarism]{.underline} as I have elaborated it above, [in which
organized political violence is made desirable through ideology and
thereby loses strategic impetus and restraint. This is important because
it has also shaped the response of those seeking to reclaim security
against these critiques. Revealingly, these responses tend either to
reject the call for desecuritization as too pacifist or to develop
**safeguards** against the specific effects that these critics identify
with 'militarization', **rather than engaging with the underlying
ideological nature of militarism**. While this has certainly left their
analysis wanting, and reveals an equally unsatisfactory
conceptualization of militarism, it also shows the limitations and
vulnerability of critical security studies arguments calling for
desecuritization]{.underline}. For example, Booth argues that security
should only ever be the 'means' for the 'end' of emancipation (Booth,
2007: 114--115) and that means and ends should be related
'non-dualistically' (i.e. the means should be consistent with the ends
sought; see Booth, 2007: 428--441). He explicitly includes political
violence as a means that must be subject to this rule (Booth, 2007:
429--431), and he even embraces aspects of Gandhian nonviolence (Booth,
2007: 115). [Discussing the critique offered by securitization theory,
he responds, 'we would all presumably agree that the unnecessary
securitisation (militarisation) of issues is to be deplored, but there
are occasions when introducing a military dimension is
sensible']{.underline} (Booth, 2007: 168). [Booth's ethical criteria for
the use of force therefore give him the confidence to respond that not
all militarization is a bad thing, and that it can be used for
progressive ends]{.underline}. What is notable here is that Booth also
invokes a thin notion of 'militarization', more or less reducible to the
decision to use force, to establish his claim. He is quite comfortable
with the risks of militarization identified by securitization theory
because he believes he has circumvented them. By contrast, the critique
of militarism as ideology gives us more powerful tools to disagree with
Booth here. For Booth ignores the danger that, in conditions of
militarism, war can begin to serve a wide array of non-strategic
instrumentalities as a result of its ideological penetration of social
relations. Militarism can entrench a pattern of conflict by binding
social relations, subjectivities and identities to the pursuit of war,
thereby making war far less amenable to ethico-political discipline than
he imagines. By [setting up emancipation as an imperative that must be
'secured', including militarily, Booth opens a dangerous pathway to the
entrenchment of violence.]{.underline} Responding to critiques of
securitization in their cosmopolitan approach, [Burke, Lee-Koo and
McDonald]{.underline} are more sensitive to these dangers, admitting
that the use of force can entrench conflict and thus impair the longer
term pursuit of global security (Burke et al., 2014: 19--21). In
response, they argue that the ultimate aim of security practice should
always be nonviolence, 'a gradual but determined demilitarisation of
global politics' in which force is permissible under strict conditions
but always regrettable -- 'a pacifism of ends rather than means' (Burke
et al., 2016: 74). They [place their confidence in a set of detailed
principles restricting the use of force in different circumstances,
which they hope will help to avoid these risks]{.underline} (Burke et
al., 2014: 71--97, 119--145). [Again, however, the ambition for
nonviolence rests on the thin basis of an aspiration for
'demilitarization', something that they in fact derive from the critique
of securitization, rather than an understanding of militarism as
ideology]{.underline}. As I have explained above, [what characterizes
militarism is not violence with a lack of a true justification but an
ideological desire for war and military activity. Militarism is
therefore fully compatible with a credible justification for violence,
and may even draw strength from it]{.underline}. Burke, Lee-Koo and
McDonald's criteria for the use of force may well be stricter than
available alternatives, therefore, but this is still no guarantee
against militarism. Even if they succeeded in preventing some wars, they
would still not ensure that the remaining, apparently justified wars did
not indulge in and encourage militarism. [Cosmopolitan theories
therefore do not disrupt the ideological factors making war desirable;
rather, they risk supplementing them with additional justifications. A
more effective critical intervention against cosmopolitan security is
therefore to highlight the dangers of militarism as ideology, rather
than simply to call for demilitarization]{.underline}. Conclusion [What
the above arguments stress is the importance of embracing a critical
concept of militarism, one premised on the explicit ambition to disrupt
its ideological effects]{.underline}. With this in mind, it is worth
considering why most critical security studies scholars prefer to adopt
the term 'militarization' rather than 'militarism'. 'Militarization' in
this usage seems to imply the process of making something a military
concern. In this way, it is similar to Shaw's account, in which
militarization implies an increase in the penetration of social
relations in general by military relations -- or, in other words, the
process by which more and more things are made military concerns. [For
Shaw, the concept of militarism functions as a measure of this
penetration. But this is not the same as a critical concept of
militarism, in which the specific kind of penetration being analysed is
an ideological penetration and in which the intention is to disrupt this
penetration through critique]{.underline}. [Like Shaw, critical security
studies has also understood militarism as a **measure** (of
'militarization') **rather than as a critical concept**, with the result
that **its analytic and political potential has been blunted** when
engaging in the critique of violence.]{.underline} However, this may
also be a reflection of an underlying tendency in critical security
studies itself. For we could argue that [neither security nor
securitization are critical concepts in the sense intended by ideology
critique. Instead, they are more like measures, in that they measure
either how secure something is or how securitized an issue has become.
One consequence of this, which is particularly problematic for scholars
seeking desecuritization, is that these concepts therefore also actively
participate in the process they seek to critique: they name things as
'security' issues, even when the argument is that these issues should
not be security issues at all. This proliferation of security concerns,
encouraged as much by scholarship as by practitioners, results in the
'**crowding out' of other frameworks that** may **more accurately
reflect the underlying dynamics** -- concepts such as war]{.underline}
(Barkawi, 2011) [or neoliberalism]{.underline} (Montesinos Coleman and
Rosenow, 2016) -- [and that may be more appropriate for critical
ethico-political interventions into phenomena that critical security
studies interprets as security or securitization. My final suggestion is
that militarism is yet another concept that risks being obscured in
critical security studies analysis by this tendency to measure rather
than critique. By contrast, I have shown above how a more critical
concept of militarism as ideology can offer a **superior starting
point** for an analysis of the shortcomings of various justifications
for the use of force, including those encountered in critical security
studies. Militarism can help us to think more precisely about the
circumstances in which the use of violence to achieve political
objectives (such as 'security') can descend into a more generalized and
intractable desire for war and military activity. My hope is that **from
such an understanding we might** also **better equip ourselves to
intervene in this process and resist it**.]{.underline}

[Some words]{.underline}, phrases or slogans [have their own set of
dynamics]{.underline} and special importance¶ [within international
politics. They convey a]{.underline} global [problem or
threat]{.underline} such, as the¶ Cold War, the war on terror, or global
warming and climate change. [They label political¶
developments]{.underline} such as perestroika, the alterglobalization
movement or the Arab Spring.¶ [They articulate desired political and
social developments]{.underline} and visions [such as]{.underline}
sustainable¶ development, social security, global [justice
and]{.underline} world [peace]{.underline}. Some phrases accompany¶ and
propel social change, including examples such as Liberty, Equality, and
Fraternity¶ during the French Revolution, Bread, Peace and Land in the
Russian Revolution, or We¶ are the 99 percent, the slogan of the Occupy
movement (Laclau 2005, p. 97). Other terms¶ designate political
programs, such as social market economy, neo-liberalism, green¶ economy,
socialism and, of course, democracy.¶ Drawing on theorists such as
Foucault, Derrida or Butler, many scholars in the field of¶
international relations (IR) theory have pointed out the importance of
discourse for reality¶ construction (George 1994, Edkins 1999, de Goede
2006). Such approaches emphasize the¶ production of reality byway of
articulatory practices while underlining the connection between¶
language, knowledge and power. Studies based on a Foucauldian genealogy
(Foucault 1976,¶ 1979, 1985) or Derrida's method of deconstruction
(Derrida 1976, 1978, Cornell and¶ Rosenfeld 1992), for example, point to
power relations that shape social reality. In this respect,¶
post-structural studies in IR are concerned with the construction of
political identities.¶ Given the centrality of specific terms in global
politics, it is surprising that the theory¶ of empty signifier proposed
by Ernesto Laclau (1996a, 2005) has not been taken up¶ widely and
systematically within IR theory. In fact, only very few studies at all
draw on¶ the discourse theory of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe
(Laclau and Mouffe 1985, see¶ Daly 2004, Howarth and Torfing 2005, Wæver
2005, Hansen 2006). And of those that do,¶ even fewer make reference to
the concept of the empty signifier (Neumann 1999,¶ Methmann 2010,
Herschinger 2012). Although a number of such contributions have¶
successfully addressed a variety of political issues, [none have
systematically explored¶ the concept of the empty signifier or its
analytical possibilities for global policy studies]{.underline}. I¶
argue that [engaging with this concept provides fruitful insights for
IR]{.underline} and critical policy¶ studies **[by opening up new
dimensions for analysis]{.underline}**. First, [it accounts for the
political¶ dimension of the centrality of certain terms; second, it
highlights the]{.underline} very [process of¶ constructing these terms
and third]{.underline}, [it foregrounds the political struggles which
seek to¶ launch certain terms and define their content]{.underline}.
More precisely, [**an empty signifier can give¶ meaning and hence
identity to a policy field, a political process or a socioeconomic¶
program while at the same time being shaped by ongoing politics.** The
concept makes it¶ possible to explain]{.underline}, on the one hand,
[how some words]{.underline} or phrases [take on]{.underline} political¶
[importance, and]{.underline}, on the other hand, [how ongoing political
struggles seek to establish¶ the definition of certain
terms]{.underline}, giving them a specific relevance for social
processes.¶ Political identity construction is conceptualized with
political strategies and dynamics,¶ which make the concept of the empty
signifier interesting for gaining a better understanding¶ of different
issues associated with global politics. [The concept emphasizes the¶
importance of considering references to general public interest in
global politics and the¶ way in which such interest is
constructed]{.underline}. **[It strengthens the possibility of
examining¶ political strategies in the process of developing policy
programs]{.underline}**.1 It also provides a foil¶ for scrutinizing the
interplay between universal and particular interests.

### Alt k 2 Policymaking

#### Our alternative is a prior question to any policy making- we must examine hegemonic struggles over empty signifiers to understand the relationship between social groups and power

[The conceptualization of the general interest as an empty space opens
up an analytical¶ perspective that sheds light on the different
political struggles to occupy that space]{.underline}. In this¶ respect,
[the concept of the empty signifier]{.underline} and its use for
political analysis is not just about¶ the power of certain political
terms. More fundamentally, it **[is about the construction of¶ political
identities]{.underline}**. [The concept]{.underline} of the empty
signifier, then, [enables a refined operationalization¶
and]{.underline}, hence, [analysis of the way certain political
identities are constructed]{.underline}. Its¶ very starting point is the
assumption that [naming is a hegemonic operation and identity¶
construction, a political process]{.underline}. Based on this
assumption, and as shown in the foregoing¶ analysis, **[the political
processes that (seek to) launch or convey certain empty
signifiers¶]{.underline}** and the political 'selection processes'
**[are of interest for policy analysis]{.underline}**. [Once a
universal¶ political term becomes hegemonic, struggles arise around this
empty signifier]{.underline}: Who will¶ be able to fill the empty
signifier with what kind of meanings; by which means it is¶ possible to
broaden the chain of equivalence that points to this empty signifier?
'To¶ hegemonize something is exactly to carry out this filling function'
(Laclau 1996a, p. 44).¶ Based on the assumption that it is only the
exclusion that enables a stable identity, it¶ becomes analytically
interesting to scrutinize the politics of exclusion. This raises the¶
question: Which meanings are excluded from that chain of equivalence?¶
As stated above, a privileged and positive relation of the empty
signifier vis-à-vis the¶ (hegemonic) common good must be present. This
implies that the empty signifier has to¶ have a positive connotation
within the discourse formation in question (Torfing 1999, p.¶ 152). As
has been shown, this is by no means self-evident, as an empty signifier
can also¶ become the expression of deficiency and evil. In fact, [the
same empty signifier can¶ represent the common good for one discourse
community and simultaneously constitute¶ the incarnation of evil for
another]{.underline} (as in the case, e.g., of socialism and
capitalism). It is a¶ task for the protagonists of a certain empty
signifier to strengthen the relation to the¶ hegemonic common good
within the discourse of interest. At the same time, [alternatives¶ to
the hegemonic project have to be presented as inconceivable and
impracticable]{.underline}. Hence,¶ for an empty signifier to become
established, it has to have strong repercussions within¶ the respective
global discourse formation. Accordingly, it is imperative for empirical¶
purposes to analyze and assess the global political context.¶ Obviously,
**[this is not just a struggle over words]{.underline}**. On the
contrary, [these]{.underline} political [terms]{.underline}¶ convey
meaning, they [structure the political arena and national
policies;]{.underline} they privilege¶ some meanings, interests and
practices over others, [thereby excluding other political¶
alternatives]{.underline}. It is the claim of this contribution that
**[empty signifiers matter for global¶ politics]{.underline}**. Even
more, [empty signifiers are the very basis of]{.underline} and for
([global) politics]{.underline}. [They¶ give orientation,]{.underline}
structure the horizon of truth [and guide political
practices.]{.underline}¶ Meaning, identity and social practices are in a
permanent state of flux: 'As society¶ changes over time this process of
identification will be always precarious and reversible'¶ (Laclau 1996a,
p. 46). While we can reflect on a 'snap-shot' of ongoing global
politics¶ and analyze such a 'frozen picture' of political relations and
practices, these practices¶ continuously change over time. In this way,
objectivity becomes social objectivity whose¶ truth is in a state of
permanent negotiation. More generally stated, [the very existence of a¶
gap between particular meaning and universal meaning, and between
particular interests¶ and universal interests makes it not only possible
but also necessary for political struggles¶ to fill that gap. This is an
essential condition for vibrant democracy.]{.underline}

### Alt- Judge Solves

#### The judge has agency to prevent depoliticization- it's an iterative process between speaker and audience- voting neg prevents the depoliticizing frame from succeeding

Matt **Wood and** Matthew **Flinders in 2014**

University of Sheffield, UK; Rethinking depoliticisation: beyond the
governmental; Policy & Politics • vol 42 • no 2 • 151-70;

But -- to continue a by now familiar pattern -- [if a focus on
technical]{.underline}, managerial [and scientific discourses provides a
relevant but not particularly original set of insights, then a focus on
security]{.underline}, risk and resilience [arguably provides a more
imaginative and contemporary perspective]{.underline}. Put simply,
s[ecuritisation theory has in recent years identified a distinct pattern
of depoliticisation that tends to involve the identification of an
existential threat]{.underline} that requires emergency executive
powers, [and]{.underline}, **[if the audience accepts the securitising
move, the issue is depoliticised and is considered a 'security' issue
outside the rules of normal politics]{.underline}** (Balzacq, 2005;
Salter, 2008; 2011; Salter and Piche, 2011). As such, security studies
often regard the politicisation of an issue as representing a form of
'desecuritisation' (Kinnvall and Nesbitt-Larking, 2010; Salter and
Piche, 2011). [This discursive process may be called 'securitisation' in
the sense that it makes issues 'more firmly constrained... decisions
about them are taken in technical terms']{.underline} (Edkins, 1999,
11). Such an interpretation goes against the influential view of Buzan
et al (1998, 120) that securitisation represents a form of
hyper-politicisation, due to the manner in which it creates heightened
public attention around a social issue (compare Salter, 2011, 120;
Buofino, 2004). [The theory of moral panics]{.underline} and the concept
of a 'folk devil', however, [provide a way of reconciling these
positions]{.underline}. In essence, [the creation of an intense
political controversy]{.underline} (that is, hyper-politicisation) **[is
little more than a tool through which to then impose a definitive
position that closes down political debate]{.underline}** ([thereby
depoliticising the issue]{.underline}). [It is in]{.underline} exactly
[this vein that scholars have examined the 'war on terror']{.underline}
(De Goede, 2008a; 2008b; Balzacq, 2008; Salter, 2011), illegal
immigration (Huysmans, 2000; 2006), financial security (De Goede, 2004),
fear of crime (Parnaby, 2006), as well as climate change and resource
depletion (Carvalho and Burgess, 2005; Trombetta, 2008; Corry, 2012).
[Possibly the most novel insights]{.underline} delivered by this
perspective [are the manner in which discursive depoliticisation must
engage with different types of audience that each require a specific
language type]{.underline} (generally identified as popular, elite,
technocratic and scientific), [and how the process of securitisation
through which an issue is depoliticised is rarely passive or static,
**but is generally an iterative process between speaker and
audience**]{.underline}. This, in turn, brings us back to wider issues
concerning depoliticisation, governance and the state which in
themselves encourage us to engage with Mary Douglas' (1999) work on the
depoliticisation of risk, Ulrich Beck's (2001) analysis of 'new' risks,
Frank Furedi's (2005) writing on the 'politics of fear', or even some
comment on the link between politicisation and depoliticisation in the
context of Bauman's (2001) 'liquid modernity'. But for now these
temptations must be denied in favour of a more focused account of why
this paper's attempt to 'rethink depoliticisation' actually matters.

### FW- Epistemology First

#### Epistemology is prerequisite to any of their scenarios- all of their impacts rely on specific beliefs about violence that naturalize military power

**Tyner and Henkin in 2015**

James A Tyner and Samuel Henkin, Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA; ¶
War and Terrorism, Geography of; International Encyclopedia of the
Social & Behavioral Sciences (Second Edition), 2015

Geography as an academic discipline has a long history of¶ peace-related
research. Two early efforts include The Geography¶ of War and Peace
(Pepper and Jenkins, 1985) and The Quest for¶ Peace: Transcending
Collective Violence and War Among Societies,¶ Cultures and States
(Vayrynen et al., 1987). In part, the¶ promotion of more peaceful
geographers was in response to¶ the specter of nuclear annihilation.
More recently,¶ [geographers have critiqued]{.underline} not only [the
naturalness]{.underline} and¶ necessity [of war]{.underline} (Kobayashi,
2009; Loyd, 2009a,b, 2011,¶ 2012; Gregory, 2010; Koopman, 2010, 2011;
Ross, 2011;¶ Williams and McConnell, 2011), but have also promoted¶ a
more normative vision of geography as an academic¶ discipline (Megoran,
2008, 2010, 2011; Inwood and Tyner,¶ 2011).¶ Such efforts have not been
easy. As Williams and¶ McConnell (2011: 927) highlight, "[our
understanding of¶ what peace looks like]{.underline}, and how to
research it, **[remains underdeveloped and analysis of
its]{.underline}** **[complexities]{.underline}** and contradictions¶
**[problematically lacking."]{.underline}** Indeed, considerable
discussion has¶ centered around the politics and contestation over the¶
'meaning' and 'definition' of peace; [this work has been¶
spurred]{.underline}, partially, [out of a recognition of the **false¶
dichotomy** between 'war' and 'peace' as well as 'violence'¶ and
'nonviolence]{.underline}.' Drawing inspiration from Galtung's¶ (1969)
influential separation of 'direct' and 'structural'¶ violence, many
[geographers have destabilized the¶ epistemological foundations of a
range of artificial, socially¶ constructed binaries, including but not
limited to war,¶ peace, violence, nonviolence, conflict, and
postconflict]{.underline}¶ (Kirsch and Flint, 2011; Ross, 2011; Loyd,
2012). Flint¶ (2011: 31) accordingly calls for an approach that views
the¶ spaces of 'peace' and 'war' as intertwined; he suggests that¶
social relations are basis of construction of both and¶ concludes that
i[nstead of discrete categories, it is more¶ productive to think of a
continuum of social settings in¶ which power relations and political
differences always exist,¶ but in varying degrees]{.underline} of
consensus and nonviolence¶ compared to disagreement and violence. Much
of this work¶ has, subsequently, drawn attention to the ways in which¶
**[such false dichotomies fetishize the unremitting processes of¶ the
'production of violence' under the current mode of¶ global
militarization]{.underline}** (Farish and Vitale, 2011).¶ For Williams
and McConnell (2011: 929; see also Loyd,¶ 2012), [it is necessary to
understand peace as a social and¶ spatial process, such as "shifts
attention towards issues of power¶ and politics]{.underline} and opens
up questions on contingency, agency and¶ embodiment .. Subsequently,
[the spectrum of violence and¶ non-violence is exposed for investigation
and peace revealed to¶ be a highly differentiated
landscape]{.underline}." By extension, Springer¶ (2011, 2012) has
challenged geographers to consider¶ 'violence' also as a process. For
Springer (2012: 138) "[to treat¶ the **material expression of violence
only through its directly¶ observable manifestation is a reductionist
appraisal**]{.underline}" **[and¶ "ignores the complexity of the
infinite entanglements of social¶ relations.]{.underline}**" [It is more
appropriate]{.underline}, therefore, [to conceive of¶ violence not as
'thing']{.underline} or 'event' or even 'act' **[but rather as¶ a
process]{.underline}**; violence as moment implies momentum. In other¶
words, [the imposition of political-economic structures¶ designed to
'make life' are carried forward with a momentum¶ far beyond the initial
act. Violence conceived as such therefore¶ redirects attention toward
those actions and relations that are¶ hidden from empirical
observation]{.underline}.¶ Those scholars working in the areas of peace
have enlarged¶ the discussion to address other forms of conflict (and
terrorism)¶ that have traditionally been neglected in the geographic
study of¶ war and terror. Both feminist and critical geographers, in¶
particular, have highlighted the violence directed toward¶ (especially)
women's bodies -- as manifest, for example, in the¶ geographies of
intimate partner violence and rape (Katz, 2007;¶ Fluri, 2009; Tyner,
2012). This research has, by extension,¶ documented how [the violence of
sexism, racism, classism,¶ genderism, ableism, ageism, homophobia, and
xenophobia]{.underline} --¶ to name but a few -- **[continue to be
legitimized through the¶ production of militarized]{.underline}** and
normalized geographical¶ **[imaginations]{.underline}**. As Loyd (2009a:
865--866) concludes, "[to¶ understand who is made most vulnerable where
and how¶ socially produced harms are naturalized discursively and¶
materially, it is necessary to theorize specific economic,¶ political,
and social relations of oppression and domination¶ and how they
articulate (or intersect) in particular historical,¶ geographic
moments]{.underline}."

#### Justifications for the plan are a key site of analysis- leads to an improved understanding of arms control

Vol.32, No.1 (April 2011), pp.134--158¶ ISSN 1352-3260 print/1743-8764
online

[One]{.underline} of the [feature]{.underline}s [of the]{.underline}
post-Cold War [arms control agenda has been the emergence¶
of]{.underline} a set of control initiatives that are increasingly being
categorized under the rubric¶ of **[humanitarian arms control (HAC)1 or
humanitarian disarmament]{.underline}**.2 This includes¶ the 1997 Ottawa
convention on landmines, the 2008 Convention on Cluster¶ Munitions,
various initiatives to restrict the trade in small arms and light
weapons,¶ and current attempts to negotiate an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)
by 2012. This¶ article focusses, in particular, on the issue of
landmines and cluster munitions but¶ also discusses the issue of small
arms and the putative ATT. [The article]{.underline} has a¶ number of
[aims]{.underline}. First, [to interrogate the claims of proponents that
such initiatives represent¶ a novel and benevolent post-Cold War turn in
conventional arms trade control]{.underline},¶ one that illustrates the
ability of global civil society to exercise bottom-up power by¶
successfully interjecting human security concerns into a policy field
previously¶ dominated by the national security concerns of states.
Second, [to undertake a critical¶ historical political economy of both
pariah weapons]{.underline} regulation in particular [and]{.underline}¶
[conventional arms transfer regulation]{.underline} in general with a
view to highlighting the¶ elements of continuity and change represented
by contemporary humanitarian arms¶ control initiatives in comparison
with previous eras. [Third, to frame this more critical¶ reading of past
and current regulation in relation to current debates about the¶
relationship between moments of securitization, the everyday practices
of (in)security¶ exercised by the professionals and networks of
security, the ability of the powerless¶ to speak security, and the
consequences arising from processes of securitization¶ and
desecuritization.¶]{.underline} The first section of the article will
outline the Copenhagen School's (CS) concept¶ of securitization as well
as highlighting particular critiques of the concept relevant to¶ the
subsequent analysis of humanitarian arms control. The following section
will then¶ summarize the key elements in conventional accounts of the
post-Cold War HAC¶ agenda and particularly the campaigns on landmines
and cluster munitions. The¶ next section will locate such campaigns in
the much longer history of attempts at¶ pariah weapons regulation that
has included attempts to ban various weapons technologies¶ such as the
crossbow, the gun, the dum dum bullet, and the submarine. It will be¶
suggested that [four factors are crucial in determining the nature of
pariah regulation¶ and its relationship to the broader regulatory
frameworks]{.underline} governing the conventional¶ defence trade.
**[These are the relationship between regulation and the political and¶
material interests of powerful actors, the relationship between pariah
weapons and¶ legitimized military technology, the relationship between
economic philosophy and¶ the approach to arms regulation, and the
relationship between regulation and the¶ dominant framing of
threats]{.underline}**. The article will outline how **[these different
factors¶ have influenced conventional weapons regulation in different
eras]{.underline}** in order to¶ locate contemporary HAC initiatives
within this much broader historical political¶ economy of regulation.
[This provides the basis for a more critical, and historically¶
informed, reading]{.underline} of the HAC agenda, [particularly the
claim that it represents a¶ novel and benign post-Cold War expression of
bottom-up power that has successfully¶ challenged traditional arms
control practices that privilege the military security of¶ states over
human security considerations]{.underline}. The final section will
discuss the relevance¶ of the preceding analysis for both the current
debates on the concept of securitization¶ and the campaigning practices
of arms trade Non-Governmental Organizations¶ (NGOs).

**Ext Cooper-**

**The justifications behind the plan must be evaluated before
determining whether or not they engage in ethical policy making. The
guise of humanitarian disarmament covers the relationship between
political and material interests of powerful actors -- means they must
prove the epistemology of the aff is ethical before getting to evaluate
their impacts**

#### **The lenses with which we view war and peace influence the policy options we consider**

**Cady 10** (Duane L., prof of phil @ hamline university, From Warism to
Pacifism: A Moral Continuum, pp. 115-117)

The very notion of restraint in war--- common to all positions along the
full continuum in varying degrees--- puts the burden of proof on going
to war and on how the fighting is done. [These are]{.underline} the
[activities in]{.underline} [need of justification. The moral
presumption should be to]{.underline} peace, [positive peace, rather
than the pervasive presumption of]{.underline} warism and [negative
peace. Recognizing the grip that warism has on dominant
culture]{.underline} [may be the most formidable task of genuine
peacemaking]{.underline} for the fore- seeable future
[because]{.underline} it is [warism]{.underline} that [blocks evolution
toward more]{.underline} [pacifistic societies]{.underline}. Only
occasionally will individuals back into the most absolute form of
pacifism; the cultural predisposition to warism confines most of us to a
narrow range of options toward the war- realist end of the scale. This
brings us full circle and we end this consideration of a moral continuum
on the morality of war and peace where we began, confronting warism.
[The **normative lenses** of warism, the **spectacles through which
we**]{.underline} in modern culture tend to [**see and interpret all
that happens**, turn out]{.underline} [to be as much like **blinders**
as lenses because they **restrict our vision** to]{.underline} [a narrow
range of options. Nietzsche said that **if the only tool you
have**]{.underline} [**is a hammer, everything begins to look like a
nail.** Under such conditions it is pretty hard to resist
hammering.]{.underline} Analogously, **[if the only]{.underline}**
**[vision we have is warist and the only tools we build are weapons,
then]{.underline}** every conflict invites military intervention and
**[it is hard to resist war]{.underline}**- ring. [Unless we envision a
wider]{.underline} value [perspective than the warist, we]{.underline}
[will not see]{.underline} the [nonviolent options]{.underline} before
us. But to see more widely [we need to **acknowledge and remove the
blinders**]{.underline}. [Peace education is]{.underline} a
[small]{.underline}, struggling, [but growing]{.underline} segment of
contemporary education. [The dominant presumption of warism
has]{.underline} [made it difficult for]{.underline} those committed to
[peace education]{.underline} [to develop]{.underline} and establish it
[as a legitimate discipline]{.underline} devoid of the image of mere
anti- militarist propaganda. Some scholars call themselves peace
educators while many within the traditional disciplines are reluctant to
be so labeled; they may be sympathetic with genuine peace research and
teaching but afraid of the stigma that goes with the label. Those
[scholars interested in applying their professional]{.underline}
training and [skills to peace]{.underline} issues [face a monumental
task. Education **at all levels must address**]{.underline} [**warism**,
just as they have had to address racism, sexism, ageism, classism,
homophobia, and other forms of domination.]{.underline}4 There is
increasing academic interest in what scholars call "institutional
violence"--- social structures like racism, sexism, and poverty that
involve constraints that injure and violate; systems that have
entrapping, coercive effects. Institutional forms of violence tend to be
more covert than overt; nonetheless pacifists--- peacemakers---of
various sorts tend to work toward the recognition and abolition of these
forms of oppression as the natural manifestation of their commitment to
positive peace. Such work involves recovery of lost or neglected
history, consideration of a full range of options beyond traditional
social constraints holding the forms of domination in place, and
serious, systematic, and legitimized study of conditions constituting
positive peace. Preparing for [war in]{.underline} [an effort to prevent
war and preserve the status quo must be distinguished from]{.underline}
preparing for [genuine positive peace]{.underline} in an effort to en-
courage cooperation and preclude a resort to war. [Unless such
issues]{.underline} [are entertained routinely across all educational
levels]{.underline}--- including the recognition of how the various
forms of domination are entangled in and reinforced by warism--- [the
presumption of warism will continue]{.underline} [to drive us toward
war]{.underline} realism [and prevent progress toward]{.underline} an
evolving [positive peace]{.underline}.5 [Easing the grip of warism may
be unlikely, but]{.underline} [then racial integration in public
schools, abolition of slavery, women]{.underline} [voting]{.underline}
and holding public office, [the end of apartheid in South
Africa]{.underline} and the Iron Curtain in Europe, [the election of an
African American]{.underline} [as U.S. president, all were exceedingly
unlikely not long before they]{.underline} [became realities. People
imagine, work for]{.underline}, and sacrifice for
[important]{.underline} [goals even if they never are
achieved]{.underline}. To the wonder of us all, [unlikely]{.underline}
[goals are sometimes reached]{.underline}. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
believed that "[the arc of history bends]{.underline} [toward
justice.]{.underline}" He knew th

at racial segregation would end . . . some- day . . . so he called on
Americans to "plan for the inevitable."6 Similarly, pacifists envision a
broad cultural evolution from warism toward (and eventually, to)
pacifism, so pacifists ask us to prepare for the inevitable by
recognizing and backing away from warism and by working to create and
sustain the conditions of genuine positive peace. While **[education is
crucial]{.underline}**, peace educators cannot bear the burden of the
wider cultural failure to see beyond warism. [Scholars]{.underline} and
teachers [in]{.underline} [traditional disciplines must
address]{.underline} the relevant [warist]{.underline}/pacifist
[issues]{.underline} [of their fields just as feminist scholarship has
been undertaken]{.underline} by academics [in all fields, and just as
racist claims have been]{.underline} tested and [dispelled]{.underline}
by research [in all disciplines. Anti-warism work and
positive]{.underline} [peace making cannot be ghettoized in token
departments and journals]{.underline} and dismissed for pushing an
agenda; [they must be undertaken **across every curriculum**, not
marginalized but central,]{.underline} if we are to assist in preparing
for the inevitable. It is remarkable how low [peace
research]{.underline} is among government and foundation priorities. The
moral continuum here [may prove useful in eroding]{.underline} warist
[obstacles to taking peace positively]{.underline} if only because it
recognizes gradual variations among views within a single moral
tradition rather than encouraging polarized views. Peace research and
study need not lead to any conversion experiences; it would be
surprising were they to do so, despite popular fears.

**Ext Cady- it's a net benefit to our fw**

#### **The lenses with which we view war and peace influence the policy options we consider -- means epistemology is a prereq to effective policy options**

1.  **Pedagogy should come first- when researching IR the aff makes
    assumptions about what kinds of violence matters- ie) war in \[ \] -
    but they ignore the ongoing structural violence that creates the
    conditions of those problems**

2.  **Debate become valueless without epistemological evaluation bc
    people can just defend false arguments and we never actually learn
    anything**

### FW At: Policymaking Key

#### Their policy only framework is a link- it papers over key questions about the nature and structure of society- these are the backdrops that shape the very terrain of what 'policy' is

Matt **Wood and** Matthew **Flinders in 2014**

University of Sheffield, UK; Rethinking depoliticisation: beyond the
governmental; Policy & Politics • vol 42 • no 2 • 151-70;

At first glance, [our third face]{.underline} appears remarkably similar
to societal depoliticisation, in the sense that it [can be initiated
both from within and outside the state]{.underline}, [it primarily
relates to **debate**]{.underline} and deliberation, [and it focuses on
the tools through which debates concerning political choice]{.underline}
and contingency [are closed down]{.underline}. [The point]{.underline}
of departure, however, [lies in discursive depoliticisation's focus, not
on institutions,]{.underline} arenas or actors **[but on ideas and
language]{.underline}**. [It therefore offers a decentred approach
that]{.underline} cuts across conventional boundaries (that is, public/
private) and instead [recognises the manner in which any speech act
which seeks to form]{.underline} 'necessities, permanence, immobility,
[closure]{.underline} and fatalism... concealing, negating or removing
contingency', **[is itself a powerful tool of
depoliticisation]{.underline}** (Jenkins 2011, 160). As such[,
depoliticisation occurs when the debate surrounding an issue becomes
technocratic]{.underline}, managerial, **[or disciplined towards a
single goal,]{.underline}** and hence changed in content. (A process of
discursive politicisation would therefore involve the promotion of a
topic as a public issue where competing interpretations exist as
choices.) [The promotion of an issue, but alongside a single
interpretation and the denial of choice would]{.underline}, therefore,
[create a form of depoliticisation from this discursive
perspective]{.underline}. Moral panics, for example, serve to politicise
certain issues in an explosive manner, while at the same time tending to
depoliticise those issues by focusing attention on specific 'folk
devils', alongside a grossly simplified narrative that posits a simple
solution (constrain, reject, kill the folk devil) to a complex problem.
The demonisation of social groups therefore adds a new twist to our
understanding of depoliticisation, in the sense that a dominant
sociology of knowledge rapidly emerges that tends to create an intense
social reaction, while also succeeding in closing down debate and
deliberation (see Cohen, 2002). [At the centre of this third 'face'
is]{.underline} therefore what might be termed [a 'Gramscian'
intellectual perspective, with an emphasis on radical thinking and **the
role of language and culture in relation to political
debates**]{.underline}. Analyses of the discursive 'face' of
depoliticisation developed from radical theoretical literature during
the post-Cold War period, which highlighted how [the dominant
'anti-political' culture transcended certain political divisions,
thereby creating the illusion of 'consensus']{.underline}.
[Scholars]{.underline}, such as Pierre Bourdieu (2003), Slavoj Žižek
(2002), and more recently Chantal Mouffe (2005), [argued in favour of
new forms of radical democratic action that exposed the existence of
antagonism and 'difference'.]{.underline} Jacques Rancière (1995, 5)
sums up the attitude of this literature to the post-Cold War world,
arguing that [politics]{.underline} ends 'as a secret voyage to the
isles of utopia' to [become 'the art of steering the ship and embracing
the waves]{.underline}, in a natural, peaceful movement of growth'. In
other words, **[grand ideological clashes give way to technocracy and
acceptance of neoliberal discourse]{.underline}**. [The value of
identifying]{.underline} the existence of [discursive depoliticisation
is]{.underline} therefore simply **[the manner in which it exposes the
power and capacity of certain political actors to promote 'the politics
of denial']{.underline}** but, more importantly, the manner in which it
seeks to re-politicise certain issues. Put slightly differently, [the
scholars who work within this approach tend to be critical social and
political theorists who seek to challenge hegemonic interpretations of
the 'end of history' and seek to promote the existence of
antagonism,]{.underline} conflict, difference and choice (see for
example Mouffe, 2005). '[Politics']{.underline} from this perspective
[is]{.underline} therefore [distinct from 'the political']{.underline},
as Žižek (2002, 193) explains: [The difference \[is\] between 'politics'
as a separate social complex]{.underline}, a positively determined
sub-system of social relations... [and]{.underline} '[the
political']{.underline} \[le politique\] [as]{.underline} the moment of
openness, of undecidability, **[when the very structuring of society,
the fundamental form of the social pact, is called into
question]{.underline}** -- in short, the moment of global crisis
overcome by the act of founding a 'new harmony.
'[Politicisation']{.underline}, in this sense, **[is a radical act of
recognising 'the political'; the possibility that society can be
constituted differently]{.underline}**; **[it is the opposite of
fatalism and denial.]{.underline}** [Discursive
perspectives]{.underline} on depoliticisation therefore resonate with
Bauman's In search of politics (1999), in the sense that they **[are
concerned with how language and a careful approach to the 'framing' of
issues can serve to close down certain options by making any opposition
appear almost 'irrational']{.underline}**. This is an approach that has
some traction in the governance literature, informing Rogers' (2009a,
2009b) analysis of British economic policy making in the mid-1970s, Kerr
et al's (2011) study of David Cameron's approach to statecraft ,and
Flinders and Buller's (2006) emphasis on discursive 'preference shaping'
(the weakness of these studies being their exclusive focus on the
discourse of politicians). [Discursive depoliticisation therefore brings
with it a powerful set of methods, theories and insights]{.underline}
that reflect an intellectual history, including Habermas' (1996)
analysis of 'scientism' and its capacity to depoliticise both language
and decision making, not to mention Foucault's (Burchell et al, 1991)
analysis of the depoliticising capacity of neoliberal 'governmentality'
(see also Dean, 1999; Lemke, 2001). These meta-theoretical positions
have come to inform governance studies in several ways. [The
'interpretive turn' in political science has]{.underline}, for example,
e[mphasised the role of]{.underline} beliefs and traditions, as well as
**[dilemmas and competing narratives, and how these can politicise
certain issues while depoliticising others]{.underline}** (for example,
Bevir and Rhodes, 2010). Within International Relations, by contrast,
constructivist approaches have been deployed to expose the
depoliticising power of discourse and language around global governance
and international institutions, as illustrated in the work of Widmaier
et al (2007) and Schmidt (2010).

evolutionary trend¶ toward kindness, merely a shift from inter-personal
ferocity to long-distance callous¶ indifference]{.underline}. Plunging
sharp weapons into flesh has been replaced by bombing at a¶ distance.
Historically swords and javelins inflicted direct bodily violence, one
person¶ trying to hack at the body of another. Ferocity is required for
this and was valued as a¶ social trait. Bowmen were partly an exception,
inflicting death at a distance, but if their¶ infantry and cavalry
protectors were dispersed, they would probably be slaughtered.¶ Sports
like tournaments and jousting, archery, and quarter-staff combat were
specifically¶ geared to ready the medieval population for physical
combat. The great warrior¶ was he who was most ferocious and vicious.
But [the deadliest weapons are now¶ wielded by people who never see the
enemy they kill]{.underline}. [This was]{.underline} early typified by¶
artillery corps firing on dots in the landscape and it was [epitomized
by World War II¶ bombers who never saw the enemy at all]{.underline}.
Here are the mundane yet chilling words of¶ William Sterling Parsons,
the commander of the Enola Gay immediately after he had¶ dropped the
first atomic bomb at Hiroshima:¶ Results clear cut successful in all
respects. Visible effects greater than any test.¶ Conditions normal in
airplane following delivery (quoted by Malesevic 2010, p. 83).¶ **[There
is no hint of any violence in the tone of his log entry, only
bureaucratic¶ indifference]{.underline}** to the impact of atomic bombs
on the victims.¶ Postwar guided missiles further lengthened the
distances between killers and victims,¶ while today's drones can be
fired from a continent away. The bulk of military¶ training is now
technical, and calmness and callousness, not ferocity, are the dominant¶
martial virtues. There are special force and infantry exceptions to this
but ferocity is¶ largely removed from the culture of the Northern
countries making war. Randall¶ Collins (2008) has produced extensive
data on violent encounters within countries of¶ the North. He notes that
those involved are not actually very skilled at body-to-body¶ violence.
They flail and slap and they lack the ability to go for the jugular. The
abolition¶ of conscription and the use of specialized mercenaries is
growing. This removes war¶ from the everyday experience of most young
men in the North of the world. There is no¶ need for much cultural
resonance of violence or training for inter-personal violence.¶ Indeed,
today we regard physically vicious people as deviants. We still have
sports like¶ boxing and wrestling (as did medieval people) but these are
no longer relevant to war.¶ Again, it is fantasy violence.¶ Also
relevant to the question of culture is the proportion of army size to
total¶ population, "the military participation ratio," MPR, pioneered by
Stanislas Andreski¶ (1954). Ratios in peacetime ratios are always lower
than in wartime so large fluctuations¶ are to be expected across time
and space. The earliest estimated ratios are for¶ classical Greece and
Rome (ancient Chinese texts give unbelievable figures). Most¶ ratios in
the Greek city-stats were in the range of a 3--5% MPR but when
threatened by¶ major war this could rise above 10%. Roman figures were
higher. As in Sparta the¶ Roman ratio sometimes rose during over 20%
(Morris 2005, Patterson 1993). In¶ medieval and modern Europe ratios
again fluctuated---under 2% in the twelfth century,¶ growing because of
wars in the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, rising to near 20%¶
during the Thirty Years War and then dropping to only about 2% by 1789.
The¶ Napoleonic Wars inaugurated another cycle of surge and decline. The
ratio reached¶ 11% in the US civil war, and between 7% and 11% among the
European Powers in¶ World War I. Ratios were under 1% in the inter-war
period but surged to 7--12% in¶ WorldWar II. It then fell through the
abandonment of conscription in most countries to¶ under 2% by 2000, and
1% by 2010. Yet a few states in dangerous areas, like the¶ Middle East
or East Asia, continue to mobilize 10% of the population.¶ It is
difficult to discern long-term trends from this, [yet in the advanced
countries¶ lower MPRs are likely to stay, the consequence of armed
forces becoming much more¶ capital-intensive, requiring the services of
fewer soldiers but much larger numbers of¶ civilians to supply
them]{.underline}. [World War II figures suggest]{.underline} [that the
United States]{.underline}, Britain,¶ the Soviet Union, and Germany all
**[mobilized at least half of their national product for¶ military
spending]{.underline}** (Harrison 1988, Harrison table 3). **[If we
could construct an" economic¶ mobilization ratio," it would probably be
much higher than in most prior history]{.underline}**.¶ In
pre-industrial periods we cannot measure total product, but armaments
industries¶ were smaller while most of the total product in a
near-subsistence economy would have¶ to be consumed by farmers who had
to be fed in order to supply the armies. Now [mass¶ armies have become
rare]{.underline}, conscription has been abolished, [but a large
military industrial¶ complex has appeared. The workers in that complex
are highly unlikely to¶ experience bodily violence, still less death.
All that is required of them is a certain¶ callous indifference to the
likely victims of the weapons they are making]{.underline}.

[The range of critical security studies]{.underline} literatures
[calling for desecuritization]{.underline} therefore [do
not]{.underline} yet¶ [offer a full account of militarism]{.underline}
as I have elaborated it above, in which organized political violence¶ is
made desirable through ideology and thereby loses strategic impetus and
restraint. **[This is¶ important because it has also shaped the response
of those seeking to reclaim security against these¶
critiques]{.underline}**. Revealingly, [these responses tend either to
reject the call for desecuritization as too pacifist¶ or to develop
safeguards against the specific effects that these critics identify with
'militarization',¶ rather than engaging with the underlying ideological
nature of militarism.]{.underline} While [this]{.underline} has¶
certainly left their analysis wanting, and reveals an equally
unsatisfactory conceptualization of¶ militarism, it also [shows the
limitations]{.underline} and vulnerability [of]{.underline} critical
security studies [arguments¶ calling for desecuritization]{.underline}.¶
For example, [Booth argues that security should only ever be the 'means'
for]{.underline} the 'end' of [emancipation]{.underline}¶ (Booth, 2007:
114--115) and that means and ends should be related 'non-dualistically'
(i.e. the¶ means should be consistent with the ends sought; see Booth,
2007: 428--441). He explicitly includes¶ political violence as a means
that must be subject to this rule (Booth, 2007: 429--431), and he even¶
embraces aspects of Gandhian nonviolence (Booth, 2007: 115). Discussing
the critique offered by¶ securitization theory, he responds, 'we would
all presumably agree that the unnecessary securitisation¶
(militarisation) of issues is to be deplored, but there are occasions
when introducing a military¶ dimension is sensible' (Booth, 2007: 168).
[Booth's ethical criteria for the use of force therefore give¶ him the
confidence to respond that not all militarization is a bad thing, and
that it can be used for¶ progressive ends]{.underline}. What is notable
here is that [Booth]{.underline} also [invokes a]{.underline} thin
notion of ['militarization']{.underline},¶ more or less [reducible to
the decision to use force,]{.underline} to establish his claim. [He is
quite comfortable¶ with the risks of militarization]{.underline}
identified by securitization theory because he believes he has
circumvented¶ them[. By contrast, the critique of militarism as ideology
gives us more powerful tools to disagree¶ with Booth here. For Booth
ignores the danger that, in]{.underline} conditions of [militarism, war
can begin¶ to serve a wide array of non-strategic instrumentalities as a
result of its ideological penetration of¶ social relations]{.underline}.
[Militarism can entrench a pattern of conflict by binding social
relations,]{.underline} subjectivities¶ and identities **[to the pursuit
of war, thereby making war far less amenable to ethico-political¶
discipline than he imagines]{.underline}**. [By setting up emancipation
as an imperative that must be 'secured']{.underline},¶ including
militarily, [Booth opens a dangerous pathway to the entrenchment of
violence]{.underline}.

### At: Perm- Negative Peace Incompatible

#### The alt's positive peace is mutually exclusive from the aff's negative peace -- short-term solutions to war foreclose critical analysis of underlying systemic causes.

**Pankhurst 3** (Donna-, May 1, Development in Practice, "The \'sex
war\' and other wars: towards a feminist approach to peace building",
Vol. 13 \# 2&3, Infomaworld)

Turning to the meanings of the term 'peace', [Galtung's]{.underline}
(1985) [conception of negative peace]{.underline} has come into
widespread use, and [is]{.underline} probably the most common meaning
given to the word, i.e. [the end or absence of]{.underline} widespread
[violent conflict associated with war. A 'peaceful' society in this
sense may therefore include a society in which social
violence]{.underline} (against women, for instance) [and]{.underline}/or
structural [violence]{.underline} (in situations of extreme inequality,
for example) [are prevalent. Moreover, this **limited** 'peace goal', of
an absence of]{.underline} specific forms of [violence associated with
war]{.underline}, can and often **[does lead to a strategy in which all
other goals become secondary.]{.underline}** [The absence of analysis of
the deeper (social) causes of violence]{.underline} also [paves the way
for peace agreements that leave **major causes of violent conflict
completely unresolved.**]{.underline} [Negative peace may therefore be
achieved **by accepting a worse state of affairs** than that which
motivated the outburst of violence in the first place, for the sake
of]{.underline} (perhaps **[short-term]{.underline}**) [ending organised
violence.]{.underline} Galtung's alternative vision, that of positive
peace, requires not only that all types of violence be minimal or
non-existent, but also that the major potential causes of future
conflict be removed. In other words, [major conflicts]{.underline} of
interest, [as well as their violent manifestation, need to be
resolved.]{.underline} Positive peace encompasses an ideal of how
society should be, but the details of such a vision often remain
implicit, and are rarely discussed. Some ideal characteristics of a
society experiencing positive peace would include: an active and
egalitarian civil society; inclusive democratic political structures and
processes; and open and accountable government. Working towards these
objectives opens up the field of peace building far more widely, to
include the promotion and encouragement of new forms of citizenship and
political participation to develop active democracies. It also opens up
the fundamental question of how an economy is to be managed, with what
kind of state intervention, and in whose interests. [But more often than
not discussion of these important issues **tends to be closed off, for
the sake of 'ending the violence', leaving major causes of violence and
war unresolved**---including not only **economic inequalities**, but
also **major social divisions**]{.underline} and the social celebration
of violent masculinities.

### At: Perm- Legal Solutions Fail

#### Reject the perm's imperfect progressivism -- the claim that legal solutions are compatible with the alt only religitimizes militarism by obscuring moral responsibility and other broader systemic violence.

*\*\*\*Note: the ATT is the Arms Trade Treaty, a previous attempt at

[The analysis]{.underline} of the ATT [advanced here suggests instead,
however, that **it is precisely the turn to law, the supposed
compatibility between military preponderance and human rights
protection, and the failure to move beyond direct use of weapons, that
helps legitimise**]{.underline} (particular forms of) [**war**. Critical
legal studies scholars advocate "a form of law-politics to develop
humanitarian principles into a concrete, normative agenda]{.underline}:"
154 [and yet **this is exactly what humanitarian disarmers have been
trying to do with**]{.underline} the ATT and previous [**arms transfer
control regimes**.]{.underline} It is important to recognize "that [some
degree of complicity in previous social structures is inherent in social
change]{.underline}." 155 Price argues that [scholars should not
underplay the morally progressive significance of "practices that at
once contain elements of progressive change ... yet **at the same time
are predicated on or produce the conditions of possibility for other
forms of exclusion,** hierarchy, inequality, repression or
violence]{.underline}." 156 [However, **the widespread emphasis on the
progressive, if imperfect character of the ATT in scholarship and
policy, has failed to interrogate the justificatory claims around moral
responsibility** that so pervaded its negotiation. These claims
contribute to **obscuring a significant scale of human rights violations
and the wider systems of war preparation that arms transfers are a part
of**.]{.underline} Further, [such claims are part of what sceptical
southern states are responding to and resisting, thus making wider
normative change more difficult. The ATT negotiation process shored up
liberal states' actions whilst invoking their benevolence and assuming
them to be distinct from illicit or irresponsible actors. The supposed
effectiveness of normative change is muted by the existence of regimes
that]{.underline} claim already to exceed the standards of the ATT. This
may not be the ideological glorification of war that we tend to equate
with the concept of militarism, but the ATT [**signals the contemporary
mobilisation of legitimacy for liberal war-making** and
war-preparation]{.underline} nonetheless.

## Framework

### At: Epistemology -- Case O/Ws

#### Epistemological critique may decrease our ability to know the future with certainty, but this only supports defaulting to any risk of impacts large in magnitude-these are more important than small structural factors

TYLER **COWEN** **in** **2006** The Epistemic Problem Does Not Refute
George Mason University Consequentialism Utilitas, Dec2006, Vol. 18
Issue 4, p383-399

**[The epistemic critique increases the plausibility of what I call
\'big event consequentialism\']{.underline}**. In this view, **[we
should pursue good consequences, but with special attention to
consequences that are very important ]{.underline}**and very good, or
correspondingly, very bad. **[This includes stopping the use of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**, saving children from
smallpox, **[making progress
against ]{.underline}**global **[poverty]{.underline}**, and maintaining
or spreading liberal democracy. **[Big events]{.underline}**, as I
define them, **[typically are of significant practical
importance, ]{.underline}**involve obvious moral issues, and their value
is not controversial to benevolent onlookers. In contrast, consider
\'small events\'. Preventing a broken leg for a single dog, however
meritorious an act, is a small event as I define the concept. Making
American families wealthier by another \$20 also would count as a small
event. **[We should not count small events for nothing, but epistemic
issues may well lower their importance in refiective
equilibrium]{.underline}**. Of course we do not need a strict dividing
line between big and small events, but rather we can think in terms of a
continuum. In some cases a large number of small benefits will sum up to
a big benefit, or equal the big benefit in importance. It then can be
argued that we should treat the large benefits and the small benefits on
a par. If we lift a different person out of poverty one billion times,
this is no less valuable than lifting one billion people out of poverty
all at once. Here two points are relevant. First, sometimes we are
facing a single choice in isolation from other choices, rather than
examining a rule or general principle of behavior**[. ]{.underline}**In
this case it does not matter whether or not the small benefits would, if
combined in larger numbers, sum up to a greater benefit. The small
benefits will not be combined in greater numbers, and we should still
upgrade the relative importance of larger benefits in our decision
calculus. Second, **[not all small benefits sum into equivalence with
larger benefits]{.underline}**. **[Sometimes one value has a lexical
relationship to (all ]{.underline}**or some) **[other
values]{.underline}**. For instance **[arguably a large number of canine
broken legs, even a very large number, do not sum in value to make a
civilization. It does not matter how many dogs and how many broken legs
enter the comparison]{.underline}**. In other words, civilization may be
a lexical value with respect to canine broken legs. And when lexical
elements are present, the mere cumulation of numbers of broken legs does
not trump the more significant value. Numerous value relationships have
been cited as lexical. A large number of slight headaches, no matter how
numerous, may not sum up in value to equal a smaller number of intensely
painful deaths or personal tortures.\" **[A very large number
of ]{.underline}**\'muzak and **[potato\' lives do not sum to overtake
the value of a sophisticated civilization]{.underline}**.\^\^ Rawls put
forward liberty and the difference principle as his lexical values for
all political comparisons.\^\^ For our purposes, we do not require a
very strict notion of lexicality for these designations to matter. A big
value need not be lexical against a (multiplied) smaller value at all
possible margins. Instead **[the big value need only be lexical across
the comparisons that arise under relevant policy
comparisons. ]{.underline}**Furthermore a big value need not be lexical
in absolute terms against all other smaller
values. **[We therefore receive further guidance as to which big events
are upgraded in the most robust fashion. The big values that receive the
most robust upgrading would be those values with some lexical
importance]{.underline}**, relative to possible comparisons against
other smaller values.\^\" To sum up these pointsz**[, critics
of consequentialism would like to establish something like the
following: \'We find it hard to predict consequences. Therefore
consequences do not matter very much]{.underline}**, **[relative
to ]{.underline}**other **[factors, such as deontology ]{.underline}**or
virtue ethics. **[We should abandon consequentialist morality.\' But so
far epistemic considerations have yet to produce a strong argument for
this view. The arguments support a different conclusion, namely
downgrading the importance of minor consequences, and upgrading the
importance of major consequences. The most robust major consequences are
those which carry values with some lexical properties]{.underline}**,
and cannot be replicated by a mere accumulation of many small benefits.

\*ableism corrected In the end, [I prefer progress within paradigms
rather than war between]{.underline} paradigms, especially **[as the

countries realign their economies on the basis of comparative advantage,
production chains are disaggregated and wrapped around the globe, and
financial crises in one country reverberate around the planet in
minutes. [Transnational terrorism threatens to turn otherwise local
disputes into global conflicts]{.underline}, and leave everyone
everywhere feeling unsafe. And all the while, [anthropomorphic change
transforms the global climate with potentially catastrophic

epistemology or ontology is always and everywhere more useful than
another.]{.underline}** [To assert otherwise is an act of **supreme
intellectual hubris.**]{.underline} This is not a plea to let a hundred,
a thousand, or ten thousand intellectual flowers bloom. Scholars working
in cloistered isolation are not likely to produce great insights,
especially when the social problems besetting us today are of such
magnitude. All knowledge must be disciplined. That is, knowledge must be
shared by and with others if it is to count as knowledge. Positivists
and post-positivists are each working hard to improve and clarify the
standards of knowledge within their respective paradigms. This is an
important turn for both, as it will facilitate progress within each even
as it raises barriers to exchange across approaches. So, if not a
thousand flowers, it is perhaps better for teams of scholars to tend a
small number of separate gardens, grow what they can best, and share
when possible with the others and, especially, the broader societies of
which they are part. Do not mourn the end of theory, if by theory we
mean the Great Debates in International Relations. Too often,
[the]{.underline} Great Debates and especially the [paradigm wars became
contests over **the truth status of assumptions**]{.underline}.
[Declarations that 'I am a realist' or pronouncements that 'As a
liberal, I predict ...' were statements of a near quasi-religious
faith]{.underline}, **[not conclusions that followed from a falsifiable
theory with stronger empirical support.]{.underline}** Likewise,
[assertions that positivism or post-positivism is a better approach to
understanding world politics are similarly \[misleading\]]{.underline}
blinding. [The Great Debates were]{.underline} too [often]{.underline}
[academic in the worst sense of that term.]{.underline} [Mid-level
theory flourished in the interstices of these debates for decades and
now]{.underline}, [with the waning of the paradigm wars, is coming into
**its own within the field**.]{.underline} I regard this as an entirely
positive development. [We may be witnessing]{.underline} [the demise of
a particular]{.underline} kind of **[grand theory]{.underline}**, [but

### At: Structural Violence First 

#### Structural violence framing is analytically useless -- can't distinguish war from other types of violence -- the move to conflate the two makes politics ineffective

**Thomas 11** (Claire, Professor of International Politics at Sheffield
University, "Why don't we talk about 'violence' in International
Relations?" *Review of Int'l Studies* 37 p. 1829-1831)

Much of [the attractiveness of this idea of structural violence is that
it broadens]{.underline} the remit of [security studies,]{.underline} or
of research into violence. Thus, economic issues and the damage done by
poverty and so on become just as important as the damage done by direct,
physical violence. Authors who work with the concept of structural
violence aim to highlight the hidden structures in order to work towards
their transformation.63 [The problem with this is that it is defining a
concept dependent on what we want to be able to study]{.underline}
within its remit. [A concept should not depend for its meaning on how we
want to study it, but rather on what the concept means]{.underline}. The
concept of structural violence is performing a similar role to the
debate about broadening the definition of security. Within the security
debate we are used to people posing the challenge of securitisation --
that people call something a security problem in order to make it sound
more urgent, more policy relevant and so on. One can pose the same
challenge to structural violence. Rather than having a clear academic
reason for stretching the concept of violence to incorporate other,
equally bad, social ills, the main reason proposed is that these [other
social ills cause as much or more damage than the damage caused by
violence]{.underline}. [This may well be the case, and these issues
should have urgent academic and policy attention]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, [re-defining a concept like violence to
incorporate these issues]{.underline} [in order to gain that attention
is a poor way of achieving this]{.underline}. [A clear argument that
states the reasons why wider social ills are more worthy of our
attention does not need the further argument that we should also call
them violence]{.underline}. So, by calling something violent, or
designating it as an issue of security, an author is claiming a certain
importance for the issue, escalating it up the policy agenda, and
allowing for extraordinary reactions. For example, by saying that
extremists use violence, one designates it as a significant and bad
problem, which allows an exceptional response of violence (called
military force) to counter it. The aim of calling something violence in
order to push it up the policy agenda, meaning it requires special,
urgent action, can also lead to dealing with these issues in a
different, exceptional way, outside the realm of 'ordinary' politics.
This may or may not be beneficial in dealing with the issue in question,
or for our politics in general.64 A [similar move]{.underline} is [made
by]{.underline} [Žižek]{.underline} [when he claims that alongside
subjective violence]{.underline} (direct, intentional violence), [there
is also objective violence,]{.underline} one form of which is [systemic
violence]{.underline} -- the damaging consequences of the 'normal'
functioning of the system. This systemic violence must be taken into
account, according to Žžiek, in order to make sense of subjective
violence.65 He argues that this systemic violence needs to be given
prominence, despite the urgency attributed to direct violence which
fights for our attention.66 Again, this argument is valid in that
systemic problems cause more suffering in the world than direct
violence. But there has to be a further reason to also call this
violence. After all, the argument can be made without the need to label
something as violence. One could argue that seeing as our concepts are
important because they change the way we think about the world, and
change the way we act in it, a definition of violence that incorporates
these other social ills would be valuable. However, broadening the
concept in this way also has the potential for being damaging. [If we
conceive of all these things as equally violent, in order to see them as
equally important, there is an implication that we are also going to
tackle the issues as problems of violence.]{.underline} [Issues of
**poverty** are not helpfully tackled in the **same way** as issues of
**direct violence.** The concept of structural violence is problematical
as it means that the definition of violence becomes linked to the result
of an act]{.underline} (or influence), [and not to the intention or
actual action of the actor.]{.underline} This illustrates a key
difference in the way violence is conceived: one way sees violence from
the perspective of the perpetrator, and sees it as intentional,
destructive force; the other way sees violence from the point of view of
the victim, and sees it as a form of violation.67 Bufacchi points out
that these two concepts of violence stem from the Latin roots of the
term. The root of the word violence is violentia, meaning a passionate
and uncontrolled force, but the meaning is often conflated with
'violation', from the Latin violare, meaning 'infringement'.68 Although
the definition of violence is partly contingent on the result of an act,
in that it requires that the intention is to physically harm the victim,
it is also necessary for that result to be a means to an end, not an end
in itself. Because the result of many different acts or situations is
physical harm or death (or unequal power or life chances), many things
become incorporated into the definition of violence if the concept of
intention is not used, and if the instrumental nature of violence is
ignored. Roberts goes some way to improving on the debate about
structural violence by pointing out that structures are created by
people, and thus structural violence can be prevented and does have
responsible actors. He also operationalises it by referring to specific
acts of structural violence, looking at avoidable civilian deaths. He
argues that his way of looking at human insecurity enables the analysis
of structures, institutions and human agency, but without the problems
caused by broadening the debate to include Galtung's concept of
realising full human psychosomatic potential.69 But this does not
prevent the problem that [structural violence still refers to anything
an author wants it to]{.underline}. Interestingly, many of Roberts'
choice of examples can be incorporated under the title of direct
violence in any case (they are preventable female deaths: infanticide,
maternal mortality, intimate killings (normal domestic murder, dowry
murders and 'honour' killings), lethal female genital mutilation; and
avoidable deaths in children under five).70 Some caution is needed in
this approach, however. It is easy to think of examples where violence
is not intentional, for example a natural disaster, or bombing an empty
building that accidentally harms someone nearby. We have already
recognised that the concept has fuzzy boundaries, and thus we can
recognise that some violence occurs naturally. [The point]{.underline}
here [is to discuss that violence which is most relevant for the study
of international politics]{.underline}. This is not the same as
accepting that everything that causes harm in some way can be captured
within the term violence. It is also not going so far as to say that
accidental acts of violence are not violence at all. Collateral damage
is still violent. The point of including the idea of intentionality in
the definition of violence is that it ensures the violence we are
discussing in international politics has an actor and does not end up
including indeterminate ideas like a state of violence. It does not just
happen on its own. It is also an action that is done with the intention
of harming, unlike acts such as a doctor causing some pain in order to
heal.

Throughout this book, I've examined attempts by scholars to identify
factors especially conducive for peace. But [there seem to be no
conditions that, in and of themselves, inoculate a society against
militarism]{.underline}. Not small government nor big government. Not
democracy, socialism, capitalism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, nor
secularism. Not giving equal rights to women or minorities nor reducing
poverty. The contagion of war can infect any kind of society. ¶ Some
scholars, like the political scientist Joshua Goldstein, find this
conclusion dispiriting. Early in his career Goldstein investigated
economic theories of war, including those of Marx and Malthus. He
concluded that [war causes economic inequality and scarcity of resources
as much as it stems from them]{.underline}. Goldstein, a self-described
"pro-feminist," then set out to test whether macho, patriarchal
attitudes caused armed violence. He felt so strongly about this thesis
that he and his wife limited their son's exposure to violent media and
contact sports. ¶ But by the time he finished writing his 522-page book
War and Gender in 2001, Goldstein had rejected the thesis. He questioned
many of his initial assumptions about the causes of war. He never gave
credence to explanations involving innate male aggression---war breaks
out too sporadically for that---but he saw no clear-cut evidence for
non-biological factors either. "[War is not a product of capitalism,
imperialism, gender, innate aggression, or any other single cause,
although all of these influence wars' outbreaks and
outcomes]{.underline}," Goldstein writes. "[Rather, war has]{.underline}
in part [fueled and sustained these and other injustices]{.underline}."
He admits that all his research has left him "somewhat more pessimistic
about how quickly or easily war may end." ¶ But here is the upside of
this insight: if there are no conditions that in and of themselves
prevent war, there are none that make peace impossible, either. This is
the source of John Mueller's optimism, and mine. [If we want peace badly
enough, we can have it,]{.underline} no matter what kind of society we
live in. The choice is ours. And [once we have escaped from the shadow
of war, we will have more resources to devote to other problems that
plague us, like economic injustice, poor health, and environmental
destruction, which war often exacerbates.]{.underline} ¶ The Waorani,
whose abandonment of war led to increased trade and intermarriage, are a
case in point. So is Costa Rica. In 2010, this Central American country
was ranked number one out of 148 nations in a "World Database of
Happiness" compiled by Dutch sociologists, who gathered information on
the self-reported happiness of people around the world. Costa Rica also
received the highest score in another "happiness" survey, carried out by
an American think tank, that factored in the nation's impact on the
environment. The United States was ranked twentieth and 114th,
respectively, on the surveys. Instead of spending on arms, over the past
half century Costa Rica's government invested in education, as well as
healthcare, environmental conservation, and tourism, all of which helped
make the country more prosperous, healthy, and happy. [There is no
single way to peace, but peace is the way to solve many other
problems.]{.underline} ¶ The [research]{.underline} of Mueller,
Goldstein, Forsberg, and other scholars [yields one essential
lesson.]{.underline} [Those of us who want to make the world a better
place---more democratic, equitable, healthier, cleaner---should make
**abolishing the invention of war** our priority, because peace can help
bring about many of the other changes we seek**.**]{.underline} [This
formula turns on its head the old social activists' slogan: "If you want
peace, work for justice]{.underline}." I say instead, "**[If you want
justice, work for peace.]{.underline}**" [If you want less pollution,
more money for healthcare and education, an improved legal and political
system---work for peace]{.underline}.

### Alt Fails- Incremental Key

#### Refusing all U.S. engagement won't solve \-- you should prefer incremental reform that reduces U.S. imperialism while retaining beneficial presence

[Of the U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ation[s' 18]{.underline}
major [human rights treaties, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is party to 5, fewer than any other nation on
earth]{.underline}, except Bhutan (4), and tied with Malaysia, Myanmar,
and South Sudan, a country torn by warfare since its creation in 2011.
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is the only nation on
earth that has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the
Child.]{.underline} It is [the only country to have pulled out of the
Paris Climate Agreement. It is]{.underline} by many measures [a top
destroyer of the natural environment]{.underline}, yet has been a leader
in [sabotaging climate protection negotiations for decades. Seven
countries and the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [reached an
agreement on Iran and nuclear energy, but the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [uniquely withdrew.]{.underline} President Donald
[Trump is threatening to withdraw]{.underline}, and Congress is
threatening to allow it, [from critical nuclear disarmament treaties
reached by]{.underline} Ronald [Reagan and]{.underline} Mikhail
[Gorbachev.]{.underline}¶ [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[not only stands outside the I]{.underline}nternational
[C]{.underline}riminal [C]{.underline}ourt, [but]{.underline} openly
[threatens sanctions against it and]{.underline} against [nations that
support it. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [leads
opposition to democratization of the U]{.underline}nited
[N]{.underline}ations [and easily holds the record for use of the veto
in the Security Council]{.underline} during the past 50 years, [having
vetoed U.N. condemnation of South African apartheid, Israel's wars and
occupations, chemical and biological weapons, nuclear weapons
proliferation]{.underline} and first use and use against non-nuclear
nations, [U.S. wars in Nicaragua and Grenada and Panama, the U.S.
embargo on Cuba, Rwandan genocide, the deployment of weapons in
outerspace, etc.]{.underline}¶ Contrary to popular opinion, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is not a leading provider of
aid to the suffering of the world]{.underline}, not as a percentage of
gross national income or per capita or even as an absolute number of
dollars. Unlike other countries, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [counts as 40 percent of its so-called aid, weapons
for foreign militaries. Its aid]{.underline} as a whole [is directed
around its military goals, and its immigration policies have long been
shaped around skin color, and]{.underline} lately around [religion,
not]{.underline} around [human need]{.underline} --- except perhaps
inversely, focusing on locking up and building walls to punish the most
desperate.¶ Keeping the above context, discussed at greater length here,
in mind, let's add to it one other set of facts. [Unarmed civilian
protectors and nonviolent peaceworkers]{.underline} from groups like
Nonviolent Peaceforce [have been proving]{.underline} for many years
that [people can accomplish more without guns than with
them.]{.underline} Thorough [studies of violent and nonviolent
campaigns]{.underline} over the past century have well [established that
principally nonviolent efforts are more likely to succeed
and]{.underline} those successes virtually guaranteed to
[be]{.underline} far [longer lasting.]{.underline} A consensus has
developed even within military establishments that [much of what
militaries do is counterproductive]{.underline} on its own terms, so
much so that ["there is no military solution"]{.underline} has
practically become a required mantra to be pointlessly but accurately
repeated by those attempting military solutions. The tools of diplomacy,
cooperation, aid, nonviolent investment, the rule of law, skilled
conflict resolution, disarmament, and peaceful conversion have become
extremely well-developed and understood, if hardly ever thought of or
employed or widely communicated.¶ Now, keeping all of that in mind, does
anything strike you as odd about exclamations that withdrawing U.S.
troops from a war is a form of "isolationism"? Is there anything
peculiar about the scores of people steadily emailing me to condemn a
planned protest of NATO as, you guessed it, "isolationism"? Five years
ago, there was a debate over whether to bomb Syria flat, and those
opposed to doing so were accused of "isolationism." Now the idea of
pulling troops out of Syria or Afghanistan or ceasing to help bomb and
starve the people of Yemen is subjected to the same rhetorical assault.
That Trump promises to keep the occupation of Iraq going is understood
as reassuring "engagement with the world" by people who demanded an end
to the occupation of Iraq when George W. Bush was president, and who
pretended to celebrate its ending when Barack Obama pretended to end
it.¶ [This is simple-minded thinking in the extreme]{.underline},
notwithstanding its claims to be just the opposite. "I'm against war but
we can't be simplistic about it and just end one of them willy-nilly,
abandoning our allies." This is the type of language used to support
imperialism in [the great debate between isolationism and imperialism, a
debate wholly dependent on the ridiculous pretense that these two
choices constitute the full range of possible human behaviors.¶ A lot of
people no longer fall for such sophistry when it comes to]{.underline}
domestic [politics]{.underline}. "Should we ignore drug users or lock
them up?" The obvious answer of "No, we shouldn't do either of those
things," actually occurs to a good many people unprompted. "Should we
allow shoplifting or imprison shoplifters for the rest of their lives?"
This is a question so patently stupid that it will actually elicit from
some people asked it the creative response: "Why not end poverty
instead? It's not like we don't have plenty of money to do that!" But
what about this question: ["Should we keep the U.S. military engaged in
each of these wars or ignore and abandon and forget about and forsake
the people there?"]{.underline} Ah, now we have [a patently stupid
question]{.underline} that has been repeated so many, many times that
it's hard to hear the stupidity of it.¶ [Each year that a war gets worse
while continuing]{.underline} somehow fails to [constitute]{.underline}
outrageous [proof that it should not have been continued.]{.underline}
The past year of the war on Afghanistan has been one of the deadliest,
yet it is the fear that things might go badly after U.S. troops leave
that is supposed to concern us. And we are supposed to be powerless to
do anything about it other than increase the bombings or avert our eyes
to focus on blaming peaceniks. [Here's another idea]{.underline} that I
think has been proposed so infrequently in part because most people
either find it unthinkable or find it too obvious to bother saying:
[What if we were to try an approach of real anti-isolationism?¶ What if
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [were to sign]{.underline}
and [ratify and abide by]{.underline} the [major laws of the world,
support the world's systems of justice, cooperate in
disarmament]{.underline} (including the nuclear weapons ban treaty),
[collaborate on climate protection, provide humanitarian
aid]{.underline} on an unprecedented scale (albeit miniscule in
comparison with military spending), [jumpstart a reverse arms race,
democratize the U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations, [participate
in truth and reconciliation hearings, invest in unarmed peacekeeping,
cease arming and training brutal dictatorships, and actually back
democracy abroad]{.underline} and [by its own example?¶]{.underline} The
son of the last dictator the United States imposed on Iran is waiting
hopefully in Bethesda, Maryland, for the next U.S. overthrow of the
Iranian government, while Iran has not picked out a future King of
America. What if the United States ceased worrying about rogue nations
and focused on ceasing to be one?¶ But, you may object, [none of that
fantasy is going to happen this week]{.underline}, while meanwhile the
Kurds are going to be massacred without their U.S. military friends.
Back [here in the real world]{.underline}, in which [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and its allies
[are]{.underline} going to go on [flooding the Middle East with weapons
and using war as foreign policy]{.underline}, each war must be continued
until . . . well, until a fantasy becomes possible, or Jesus comes back
from wherever he's been, or the Democrats take the throne but don't act
like, you know, the Democrats have always acted, or something! Of
course, we all know what the something is going to be: climate collapse,
the Middle East becoming uninhabitable for humans, and extreme weather
disasters in much of the rest of the globe. And the response to this
shocking if completely predictable and predicted development will be
violence or nonviolence, depending on what we have been conditioned to
suppose is normal or "natural" or "inevitable."¶ Given that [what is at
stake here is human survival]{.underline}, given that the U.S.
presidency has been gradually endowed with imperial powers such that the
fate of thousands of people can be determined by a tweet, [are we really
obliged to limit our short-term thinking to (a) "support the troops" by
keeping them in a desert exchanging bullets with the locals, or (b)
"abandon" people? Why not demand of the U.S. government]{.underline}
and/or other nations purporting to care about humanity, [immediate
announcement of an end to the weapons trade]{.underline}, the [opening
of diplomatic talks with]{.underline} all [relevant parties, the
commencement of a major aid program]{.underline}, and support for a
major new program of unarmed peacekeeping through a coalition of the
decent or if possible through a United Nations in which the United
States foreswears the veto?¶ Such an alternative to the
imperialism-or-isolationism trap is no more difficult to think of or to
act on than treating drug addiction or crime or poverty as reason to
help people rather than to punish them. [The opposite of bombing people
is not ignoring them. The opposite of bombing people is embracing
them.]{.underline} By the standards of the U.S. communications
corporations Switzerland must be the most isolationist land because it
doesn't join in bombing anyone. The fact that it supports the rule of
law and global cooperation, and hosts gatherings of nations seeking to
work together is simply not relevant. How about in the new year at least
we try a little new thinking?

### Alt Fails- Realism

#### State-centric and realist analysis are inevitable- the alt can't effect other countries' beliefs- default to the aff's minimization of threats

**Agnew 2k15** (John, professor of geography at UCLA, The Geopolitics of
Knowledge About World Politics: A Case Study in U.S. Hegemony)

In fact, **[considerable energy in academic international relations
today in the United States and elsewhere focuses on the weaknesses of
the neorealist synthesis]{.underline}** even as the master's programs
continue to churn out would-be practitioners often oblivious to the
political and theoretical bases of the arcane debates among some of
their teachers (Long et al., 2005 ). The continuing, even revived,
appeal of the neorealist synthesis seems to lie in its ritual appeal to
U.S. centrality to world politics (the "necessary nation," "the lender
of last resort," etc.) and in the enhanced sense since the end of the
Cold War and after 9/11 of a dangerous and threatening world that must
be approached with trepidation and preparation for potential violent
reaction and intervention as mandated by realist thinking. Yet in
practice there is a massive gap between the predictions of such
theorizing and what actually goes into the making of U.S. (or any other)
foreign policy, much of which has to do with persisting geopolitical
orderings of the world and domestic interests and their relative
lobbying capacities (Hellmann, 2009 ; Oren, 2009 ). **[International
relations as a field around the world has followed largely in American
footsteps.]{.underline}** I can attest that my own introduction to it in
the late 1960s in Britain involved reading textbooks that came
overwhelmingly from the United States. Debate about the relative degrees
of theoretical "pluralism" in the United States and Britain suggests
that at least the modes of categorizing theories are somewhat less
hidebound in the latter than in the former and that in recent years at
least there has been something of a parting of the ways across the
Atlantic, with nonrealist views becoming much more widespread in British
universities than in their American counterparts (Schmidt, 2008 ; Smith,
2008 ). More recently and elsewhere around the world, **[U.S. theories,
particularly neorealism, have proved rather more pervasive and
persistent.]{.underline}** **[In Russia]{.underline}**, for example,
which one might not expect to be particularly congenial to U.S.
ideas**[, the main academic journal about world politics, Mehdunarodnyye
protsessy (International Trends), seems to adhere to ideas about
international anarchy, nation-state developmentalism, and systemic
constraints on state action that are remarkably similar to those
represented by U.S. neorealism.]{.underline}** Even the more liberal
currents, refl ecting on globalization and a less state-oriented world,
mainly cite U.S. sources (Tsygankov & Tsygankov, 2007 ). Perhaps this
tendency refl ects the lack of local alternatives following the demise
of offi cial Marxist conceptions, dependence on funding from Western
foundations, and a general disorientation following the collapse of the
Soviet Union. It does not, however, entail much by way of support for
U.S. foreign policy, only a similar theoretical logic in arriving in
this case at Russiancentered positions (Müller, 2008 ). The recent
revival of Eurasian geopolitical thinking perhaps is a harbinger of a
more Russian-centric mode of thinking as an alternative to imported
brands (Tsygankov & Tsygankov, 2004 ). Given the cumulative crisis of
the United States in world politics over the past two decades, one might
expect to see some emerging alternative theoretical visions emanating
from beyond U.S. shores. The so-called English School of international
relations, associated in particular with the idea of "international
society" but effectively realist in many respects, has recently
undergone a concerted revival as an alternative to U.S. theories. It has
certainly traveled well beyond Britain, even if with questionable
success (e.g., Waever, 1992 ; Wendt, 1999 ). Zhang ( 2003 ) has examined
how well it has traveled to China since Adam Roberts, one of its main
advocates, visited Beijing in 1991. Lacking in equivalently talented
entrepreneurs or salesmen and the institutionalized connections between
U.S. and Chinese universities, the English School has had limited infl
uence, according to Zhang, in comparison to the continuing dominance of
U.S. scholars. But most of the main works are also not available in
Chinese, and the major research institutes in China are run by people
trained in the United States. **[To a large extent, therefore, academic
Chinese knowledge of the "international" largely remains refracted
through intellectual lenses made in the United States]{.underline}**.
Within China, however, change is in the offing. Some Chinese academics
write explicitly about what they term "international relations theory
with Chinese characteristics" (Xinning, 2001 ). In other words, China
has become involved in developing something akin to what happened in the
United States in the 1940s and 1950s. What is this Chinese synthesis?
According to Xinning ( 2001 ), there are two variants, with the second
smaller but growing more quickly. The fi rst borrows the phrase "Chinese
characteristics" from Deng Xiaoping to indicate an international
relations theory that centers on China's need to protect its
sovereignty, engage in peaceful coexistence with other states, and use
Chinese language, thought, and expression. The second asserts a more
radically Chinese vision of the world with China's status at the center
of a surrounding system, Confucian "benevolent governance," the winning
of confl icts without resorting to war, and interests, not morality, as
the basis of interstate behavior. In Xinning's words: After the
Tiananmen Square incident of 1989, most social science disciplines
(especially political science, sociology, and journalism) suffered a
setback because of the government's campaign against the ideological
liberalism of Chinese scholars and the so-called peaceful evolution
initiated by the West. However, International Relations received a
different treatment. Theoretical studies on IR continued to develop.
**[The teaching of Western IR theories continued at key universities,
and academic exchanges with the West in IR studies became more active.
This was mainly because Chinese leaders worried more about China's
isolation from the outside world than a "peaceful
evolution]{.underline}**." (Xinning, 2001 , p. 62) More recently, as
Xinning makes clear, a new Chinese international relations is evolving
which combines a range of elements (also see Yang & Li, 2009 ). **[As in
the U.S. case, however, it is its connection to state policy that gives
it special status. As in so many other features of the relationship
between the United States and China, there is an almost mirror image in
assumptions between the theory imported from the United States and what
increasingly goes for "Chinese" international relations
theory.]{.underline}** Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose. In
brief compass, I have tried to illustrate one facet of the geography of
knowledge, what I have called the geopolitics of knowledge, in relation
to one body of thinking, so-called international relations theory. I
have emphasized its founding in the early postwar United States, its
travels around the world as a function of American hegemony, and the
story of two alternatives, the English School, to illustrate the limits
of pluralism, and the rise of an IR theory with "Chinese
characteristics," to show how an alternative with hegemonic potential
can begin to emerge. Who knows, particularly if this latter, as Callahan
( 2001 ) has said in direct response to Xinning's ( 2001 ) essay on
Chinese thinking about world politics, adjusts to the more globalized
and transnational world that has seemed, at least until recently, to be
in the offing, then we may actually end up with a theory of world
politics that avoids the inside--outside views of sovereignty and the
need for a single hegemonic power that so much of recent IR theory has
been devoted to normalizing (Agnew, 2009 ). Don't bet your house on it.
**[As long as we have global political hierarchy, we are likely to have
parallel "theories" of world politics which naturalize that state of
affairs.]{.underline}**

#### Realism is human nature. Critique does nothing to stop states from struggling for power   

**Schweller 99** (Randall L. is Professor of Political Science, Director
of the Program for the Study of Realist Foreign Policy, a Social and
Behavioral Sciences Joan N. Huber Faculty Fellow at Ohio State
University, and editor-in-chief of Security Studies, Forum: fantasy
theory)

 

The problem is that Linklater argues by fiat rather than by the weight
of hard evidence, which is in scant supply here. Again and again,
radical propositions are supported by nothing more than references to
some other critical theorist who shares Linklater's vision and/or
tendency to rely on slippery, undefined and unmeasured concepts,
primarily globalisation and fragmentation. This simply will not do.
**[Whether Linklater, or Kant, or Marx, or Habermas, or other
contemporary critical, feminist, postmodern theorists believe that
something will happen]{.underline},** must happen, **c[an happen, and
should happen, does not make it so]{.underline}**---or likely to be
so---in the foreseeable future. Moreover, [**as a work of critical
political theory, it is neither very critical nor very political**. **To
believe, for instance, that the goals of the triple transformation will
be advanced by wider dialogic relations, one must naively assume not
only that there is an underlying global harmony of interests from which
a consensus can be forged on important political and social issues, but
that such 'agreements will not be reached by ignoring or suppressing
marginal and dissident voices'**]{.underline} (p. 41). In this view as
in others, **L[inklater simply skates over the central
rationalist-realist explanations for international conflict and the
struggle for power and security, e.g., states have an incentive to
misrepresent private information about their capabilities and
resolve]{.underline}**, and they may be unable to commit credibly to
uphold bargains that they would mutually prefer to war;1 the nature of
many international disputes are indivisible and therefore do not admit
compromise; states exist under conditions of material and social
scarcity with no sovereign arbiter to settle and enforce distributional
disputes. [**As long as things commonly enjoyed cannot be commonly
shared, individuals and groups will seek to influence and control others
and their environment; that is, they will struggle for social and
material power. That is what politics is all about and what
distinguishes it from other modes of human behaviour.**]{.underline}
Politics so defined is largely absent from Linklater's book. **[Leaving
aside the problem of indivisible scarce goods, a meaningful reduction in
global material inequality would require significant sacrifices from
those enjoying the good life. Surely, no one really believes that the
'haves' will voluntarily hand over their riches to the 'have-nots'.
There is no historical precedent for such altruism on a global scale,
and, no matter how much we all communicate with each other in the
future, I cannot imagine that human nature will change so dramatically
in my lifetime.]{.underline}** Thus, unless one desperately wants to
believe in this alternative future world, Linklater's book will appear
as little more than an intellectual exercise in historical speculation
and theoretical wishful thinking along familar liberal lines.

## Perm

### Perm Best- Policy Solutions

#### Political analysis is a mechanism in which we can learn to challenge current issues, find effective alternatives, and create better political solutions.

**Hird 17** \[John Hird, Dean of the College of Social and Behavioral
Sciences and Professor of Political Science and Public Policy,
University of Massachusetts Amherst. "How Effective is Policy Analysis,"
in D. Weimer & L. S. Friedman (eds.) *Does Policy Analysis Matter?
Exploring Its Effectiveness in Theory and Practice*. University of
California Press. 44-76.\]

Classical policy analysis, however absent from actual policy making,
remains an important vehicle for teaching policy analysts the
connections between their analysis and the policymaking world in which
their recommendations would live. [**Even if** it implies more power
than analysts will ever have, classical **policy analysis** teaches that
politics, law, implementation, social structures, organizational
behavior, and other factors are **critical to policy outcomes** and must
play key roles in **thinking through** possible ways to address policy
problems]{.underline}. [**Bringing policy ideas to fruition**, bridging
the worlds of research and policy making, is a **critical skill** for
analysts to develop]{.underline}.¶ In addition, policy schools are
instilling in prospective policy analysts the structure and habits of
mind to engage successfully in the policy enterprise. 28 [Teaching
**disciplined thinking** for public service is important]{.underline}.
[Policy analysts not only have a **problem-oriented**,
**interdisciplinary** approach to policy and the **ability to
synthesize** and **bring policy relevance** to problems that social
scientists are not trained for, but they understand the \"rational
lunacy of policy-making systems\"]{.underline} (Weiss 2009).¶ In the
absence of written classical policy analyses, [policy analysts become
their human embodiment]{.underline}. [Their training will provide a
mental picture of how a classical policy analysis should be
performed]{.underline}. They can derive elements of policy analysis from
writing position papers, briefing policy makers, and controlling
meetings. [They **anticipate counterarguments** and frame their analyses
recognizing alternative options]{.underline}. In short, [the **mental
map** of a policy analysis allows good policy analysts not only to be
effective in their jobs but also to **advance** into the **public
debate** the appropriate elements of a policy analysis]{.underline}.
[Further, the **problem orientation** of policy analysis **focuses** at
least some **attention** on **social problems**, not just political
expediency]{.underline}. [**The role of policy analysts is not merely to
translate research for policy makers, but to use creative means to turn
available knowledge about the implications of various policy options
into actionable policy recommendations** appropriate for their
clients]{.underline}. [This is a subtle skill requiring attention to
both political realities and the best available research]{.underline}.¶
Finally, prospective policy analysts are instructed repeatedly about the
importance of their relationship to the client(s), yet far less
attention is paid to the other part of the policy analyst\'s
relationship: to the community of knowledge producers. [Policy analysts
play **critical roles as intermediaries** between \"custodians of the
knowable\" and policy makers. Their training should include the ability
to **understand** and **interpret** the academic literature on a topic
at a **far deeper level** than most journalists have the time or, often,
the analytic skill set to uncover]{.underline}. [Identifying and
**connect**ing **pertinent knowledge** and **analysis** with policy
makers should be a core principle of a public policy
education.]{.underline} Policy analysts may offer the central means to
provide policy makers with the key elements of classical policy
analysis, though not in the way, through written reports, it was
originally conceived. Creating a profession for committed, accomplished,
and well-trained individuals to participate in the world of public
policy may be among the most important contributions of policy analysis
education.

### Perm Best/Alt Fails- Specific Policies key

#### Perm is the best option- the alt's universalizing rhetoric papers over nuance- prefer the aff's ability to target and address specific threats of violence

**Browning & McDonald 13** (Christopher S., University of Queensland,
c/o Political Science and International Studies and Matt, University of
Queensland, "The future of critical security studies: Ethics and the
politics of security," European Journal of International Relations, Vol.
19, No. 2, pg. 248-251)

[If the critical security studies project is deficient in providing us
with a sophisticated and convincing understanding of]{.underline} either
[the politics or ethics of security]{.underline} --- two core animat -
ing themes of its research agenda --- [where does this leave such a
project?]{.underline} [Does the contribution of critical security
studies extend no further than a compelling critique of traditional
approaches to security on a range of analytical and normative
grounds?]{.underline} We would argue that [there is a future in critical
security studies]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} future [will ulti -
mately be determined by the extent to which scholars recognize the
limits and tensions of existing approaches]{.underline} (especially
'Schools') [and take up the challenge of moving beyond]{.underline}
first principles or [**universalized assumptions** about security to
engage in nuanced, reflexive and **context-specific** analyses of the
politics and ethics of security]{.underline}. Indeed, [we make such a
case using the critical theoretical tool of **immanent
critique**]{.underline}, defined here as [a method of critique concerned
with locating possibilities for progressive change in **existing social
and political orders**]{.underline}. 6 In this context, we note in
particular the possibility for building upon the tensions and limits in
existing critical security studies scholarship to move this research
project forward. [We identify two key imperatives for this
project]{.underline} by way of conclusion. [The first]{.underline} of
these imperatives concerns [the need to develop understandings of the
poli - tics of security that are context-specific; that
recognize]{.underline} and interrogate [the role of differ - ent
security discourses and]{.underline} their effects in different
[settings]{.underline}; and that come to terms with sedimented meanings
and logics without endorsing these as timeless and inevitable. In terms
of context-specificity, the Western-centric nature of (critical)
security studies has ultimately encouraged a focus on how security
'works' in liberal democratic settings. This is particularly applicable
to the Copenhagen School framework, whose dichotomy between 'panic
politics' and 'normal politics' ultimately suggests a conception of
politics parasitic on a liberal democratic political context (see
McDonald, 2008; Williams, 2003). While some have attempted to explore
securitization dynamics outside these settings (e.g. Wilkinson, 2007),
the framework itself continues to work with a security--politics
dichotomy that may be wholly unfamiliar to those outside liberal
democratic states. In a fundamentally illiberal state regime such as
Burma or North Korea, for example, what does the language of security do
and what does 'normal politics' mean? [In what ways do different
cultural, social and historical contexts determine different security
logics, and how do these dynamics look]{.underline} in terms of
communities above and below the state? [And can we accept the claim that
there is no difference in the logic or effects of securitization if
security is understood as referring to the welfare of the most
vulnerable in global soci - ety, for example, rather than the
territorial preservation of the nation-state?]{.underline} Here, the
[failure to differentiate between logics of security on the basis of
what understanding of security inheres in a particular
discourse]{.underline} potentially [blinds]{.underline} Copenhagen
School and [post- structural theorists]{.underline} of security [to (the
possibility of) difference in security dynamics and logics in different
places, for different actors and at different times]{.underline}. In the
case of the Copenhagen School, such parsimony might be in part a
response to the desire to provide analytical boundaries around the study
of security rather than 'descend' into contextual analysis (see
Williams, 2010: 213--216), but it nonetheless results in a partial and
(we would argue) Western-centric image of the politics of security. at
University of Kansas Libraries on February 25, 2016 ejt.sagepub.com
Downloaded from Browning and McDonald 249 Ultimately, these points
suggest the need for far more nuance than is currently evident in
critical security studies scholarship. As noted earlier, the critical
security studies pro - ject appears bifurcated between opposing logics
of security that position the logic of security as inherently pernicious
(Copenhagen School, post-structuralism) or inherently progressive (Welsh
School). In a sense, these 'Schools' correct the limits and tendencies
of each other in important ways, suggesting (immanent) possibilities for
a more nuanced understanding of the politics of security in the critical
security studies project as a whole. Copenhagen School and
post-structural theorists explore the logic of security that fol - lows
from the dominant discourse of security in contemporary world politics,
rightly cautioning against any assumed linkage between security and
progress and pointing to the ways in which the promise of security can
be used to justify illiberal practices. The Welsh School framework,
meanwhile, recognizes that this [dominant discourse of secu - rity does
not necessarily capture the essence of security across time and
space]{.underline}, in the process [pointing to **possibilities for
progressive change in security dynamics and prac - tices**]{.underline}.
In a sense, these different approaches to the logic of security broadly
reflect struc - tural and agential tendencies in International Relations
more generally. [We]{.underline} would [argue]{.underline} that they
suggest [the need to take seriously]{.underline} the [political
limitations associated with domi - nant security discourses while
recognizing and exploring the possibility for security to **mean and do
something different**]{.underline}. A brief [analysis of]{.underline}
the [different]{.underline} constitutive security logics underlying
various secu - [rity communities around the world provides ample
evidence of the **problems of univer - salizing claims** about the
politics of security]{.underline}. As Rumelili (2008) has noted, an
instructive [comparison can be drawn between the **EU and
ASEAN**]{.underline}, in particular [in terms of how these
organizations' conception of self-identity results in them
relating]{.underline} themselves [to otherness **very
differently**.]{.underline} [Propounding an inherently
inclusive]{.underline} (i.e. democratic) [identity and normative agenda,
the EU is liable to locate otherness in an inferior position to
itself]{.underline}, as something to transform and render
acceptable/normal. Otherness is therefore something to be eradicated and
to the extent to which it rejects transformation, it becomes
destabilizing and potentially threatening. Such processes are, for
example, clearly evident in the European Neighbourhood Policy (Browning
and Pertti, 2008). In [contrast, ASEAN operates with a largely
exclusivist]{.underline} (i.e. civili - zational, geographic, ethnic)
[identity where norms of sovereignty and non-interfer - ence
dominate]{.underline}. This, Rumelili suggests, facilitates more
equitable relationships with otherness since the goal in such
relationships is not one of conversion to the cause. In terms of the
politics of security, [what becomes evident]{.underline} here [is how
concepts of security and subjectivity are intimately connected to
conceptions of identity and **the limits of political community in
different contexts**]{.underline}. The second imperative for the future
of the critical security studies project concerns the ethics of
security. We advanced the claim that a shared concern with expanding the
realm of dialogue underpins much of the critical security studies
project, albeit to differ - ent degrees and in different ways. But to
the extent that an ethics of security --- a concep - tion of the good or
progress regarding security --- orients around a concern with such a
position, this commitment needs to be acknowledged and defended. A range
of pressing questions suggest themselves here, including the bases for
prioritizing open dialogue; the relationship between spheres of
deliberation and material conditions of existence; the at University of
Kansas Libraries on February 25, 2016 ejt.sagepub.com Downloaded from
250 European Journal of International Relations 19(2) possibilities for
and limitations to the establishment of open dialogue; and the broader
relationship between dialogue and outcomes. Elaborating on these
commitments would also entail engaging with the argument that movements
towards greater dialogue could potentially encourage the desire to
exclude power, identity, emotion and other central features of global
politics (see Price, 2008). Where difficult questions emerge about this
and other dimensions of an 'ethical' engagement with security --- such
as the role of violence in the Welsh School framework, for example
(Peoples, 2011) --- these need to be confronted. If there is a
consistency across critical security studies scholarship in this sense,
it is that ethical commitments are evident (in commitments to
resistance, desecuritization or emancipation, for example) but are
insufficiently developed to provide a genuine account of what
constitutes ethical action regarding security. Indeed, [immanent
possibilities for the development of the criti - cal security
studies]{.underline} project [arise from]{.underline} these (often
implied) [commitments that need draw - ing out and examining in the
**context of difficult dilemmas** in world politics]{.underline}. This
process of drawing out ethical commitments should be viewed as a
reflexive movement towards recognizing the assumptions and potential
implications of one's own theorizing, a posi - tion central to both
broader definitions of Critical Theory (see Cox, 1981) and to the
compelling critique of traditional security studies as insufficiently
engaged with the eth - ics and effects of its own theorizing about world
politics. And it needs also to be matched up with the preceding
understanding of the politics of security. Is the expansion of delib -
eration and movement away from violence, for example, always
progressive, and does it require the rejection of security as a
political category or its reform? The example of Australian debates
around the arrival by boat of asylum-seekers in 2010 illustrates
tensions and ambiguities at work regarding the ethics of security,
particu - larly as understood in key critical approaches to the study of
security. In that context, Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard's call for
'a frank, open, honest national conversation' about asylum and border
security particularly encouraged the articulation of negative and
exclusionary views of asylum-seekers, paradoxically rendering the
(re)securitization of asylum in the Australian context more likely (see
McDonald, 2011). Particularly strik - ing here was the Prime Minister's
suggestion that this national conversation should take place outside the
limits imposed by political correctness that would otherwise discourage
the articulation of right-wing or racist sentiments towards
asylum-seekers. In this exam - ple, the apparent opening of dialogic
space encouraged by the Prime Minister was inti - mately related to the
movement towards exclusionary security logics and practices orienting
around the imperatives of 'border security'. The point of this example
is not to illustrate the limits of open dialogue per se, but rather to
illustrate two broader claims regarding the relationship between
security and ethics in the critical security studies project that we
make here. First, while normative preferences are evident, these are
often insufficiently developed or robust to enable the ethical
adjudication between different practices or outcomes. The normative
preference for deliberation evident in the commitment to
desecuritization, for example, is not suf - ficiently robust to enable
us to engage with difficult questions concerning the forms of
deliberation that should be encouraged or even the circumstances in
which 'hate speech', for example, might be curtailed (on this, see
Gelber, 2010). Second, and to return to the central argument of the
article, the Australian example reminds us of the need to explore the
implications of security conceptions and practices in particular
contexts, rather than at University of Kansas Libraries on February 25,
2016 ejt.sagepub.com Downloaded from Browning and McDonald 251 assume
that a particular security logic will inhere --- or outcomes will follow
--- from the use of the term 'security' or a stated political commitment
to 'dialogue'. The core challenge for the critical security studies
project is ultimately moving beyond critique and agenda-setting and
towards a contextual analysis of security dynamics and practices in
global politics. There is no question that a focus on the politics of
security and the ethics of security are crucial intellectual endeavours
too readily elided or ignored in traditional approaches to the study of
security. For this reason alone we need a 'criti - cal security studies
project'. However, [universalizing claims concerning the politics of
security --- found in the **securitization framework** and much
**post-structural engagement with security** --- must]{.underline}
ultimately [**give way** to **nuanced analyses** of the ways in which
security is constructed and challenged in **particular social,
historical and political con - texts**]{.underline}. A range of
theorists have --- in different ways --- sought to engage with precisely
this question, illustrating the various ways in which security dynamics
'play out' in dif - ferent settings in terms of constructing community
(e.g. Bubandt, 2005), challenging identity binaries (e.g. Avant, 2007)
or enabling space for different forms of political response (e.g. Doty,
1998/9). Yet [these insights]{.underline} ultimately remain marginal to
key 'Schools' and conceptual frameworks of security, and [are too often
forgotten in our **search for the universal in a complex
world**]{.underline}. Beyond the development of nuance in our
understanding of the 'politics of security', the critical security
studies project urgently needs to move beyond normative 'leaps of faith'
concerning the ethics of security. This particularly applies to the
Copenhagen and Welsh School preference for dialogue as a progressive
means of escaping exclusive and illiberal security logics and practices.
While genuinely open dialogue regarding the construction of security and
threat has much to recommend it, crucial here is the need for advocates
to reflect upon and lay bare the bases upon which these claims are made
in philosophical terms, and to reflexively examine the implications of
alternative security conceptions and practices in analytical terms
rather than assume particular dynamics to be progressive.
[This]{.underline} too [suggests the need to]{.underline} move towards a
[focus on the particular social, historical and politi - cal **contexts
in which security is constructed** and practised in global
politics]{.underline}.

### At: Liberal Institutions Link

#### global liberal institutions are [inevitable and good]{.underline} -- reforming them requires [engagement]{.underline} and intellectual rejection causes [genocide and nuclear war]{.underline}.

**Shaw 99** (Martin, Professor of International Relations and Politics
at the University of Sussex, November 9, "The unfinished global
revolution: Intellectuals and the new politics of international
relations")

[The new politics of international relations require us]{.underline},
therefore, [to **go beyond the antiimperialism of the intellectual
left** as well as of the semi-anarchist traditions of the academic
discipline.]{.underline} We need to recognise three fundamental truths:
First, in the twenty-first century [people struggling for democratic
liberties across the non-Western world are likely to make constant
demands on our solidarity]{.underline}. Courageous academics, [students
and]{.underline} other [intellectuals will be in the forefront of these
movements]{.underline}. They deserve the unstinting support of
intellectuals in the West. Second, the old international thinking in
which democratic movements are seen as purely internal to states no
longer carries conviction -- despite the lingering nostalgia for it on
both the American right and the anti-American left. [The idea that
global principles can and should be enforced worldwide is **firmly
established in the minds of hundreds of millions of
people.**]{.underline} This consciousness will a powerful force in the
coming decades. Third, [**global state-formation is a fact**.
International institutions are being extended, and they have a symbiotic
relation with the major centre of state power]{.underline}, the
increasingly internationalised Western conglomerate. [The success of the
global-democratic revolutionary wave depends]{.underline} first on how
well it is consolidated in each national context -- but second, [on how
thoroughly it is embedded in international networks of power, at the
centre of which, **inescapably**, is the West]{.underline}. From these
political fundamentals, strategic propositions can be derived. First,
[democratic movements cannot regard]{.underline} non-governmental
organisations and [civil society as ends in themselves. They must aim to
civilise]{.underline} local [states, rendering them open, accountable
and pluralistic, and curtail the arbitrary and violent exercise of
power]{.underline}. Second, [democratising local states is not a
separate task from integrating them into global]{.underline} and often
Western-centred [networks]{.underline}. Reproducing isolated local
centres of power carries with it classic dangers of states as centres of
war. **[Embedding global norms and integrating new state centres with
global institutional frameworks are essential to the control of
violence]{.underline}**. (To put this another way, the proliferation of
purely national democracies is not a recipe for peace.) Third, while the
global revolution cannot do without the West and the UN, neither can it
rely on them unconditionally. [We need]{.underline} these [power
networks, but **we need to tame them**]{.underline}, too, [to make
their]{.underline} messy [bureaucracies]{.underline} enormously [more
accountable and sensitive to]{.underline} the needs of
[society]{.underline} worldwide. [This will involve]{.underline} the
kind of '[cosmopolitan democracy']{.underline} argued for by David
Held80 and campaigned for by the new Charter 9981. [It will]{.underline}
also [require us to **advance a global social-democratic agenda**, to
address]{.underline} the literally catastrophic scale of [world social
inequalities]{.underline}. Fourth, [if we need the global-Western state,
if we want to democratise it and make its institutions friendlier to
global peace and justice, **we cannot be indifferent to its strategic
debates.** It matters to develop robust peacekeeping as a strategic
alternative to bombing our way through zones of crisis. It matters that
international intervention supports pluralist structures, rather than
ratifying Bosnia-style apartheid]{.underline}. Likewise, [the internal
politics of Western elites matter. It makes a difference to halt the
regression to isolationist nationalism in American
politics]{.underline}. It matters that the European Union should develop
into a democratic polity with a globally responsible direction. It
matters that the British state, still a pivot of the Western system of
power, stays in the hands of outward-looking new social democrats rather
than inward-looking old conservatives. [As political intellectuals in
the West]{.underline}, we need to have our eyes on the ball at our feet,
but we also need to raise them to the horizon. [We need to grasp the
historic drama that is transforming worldwide relationships between
people and state]{.underline}, as well as between state and state. [We
need to think about how the turbulence of the global revolution can be
consolidated in democratic, pluralist, international networks of both
social relations and state authority]{.underline}. We cannot be simply
optimistic about this prospect. Sadly, it will require repeated violent
political crises to push Western governments towards the required
restructuring of world institutions.82 What I have outlined tonight is a
huge challenge; but [**the alternative is to see the global revolution
splutter into defeat, degenerate into new genocidal wars, perhaps even
nuclear conflicts.** The practical challenge for all concerned
citizens]{.underline}, and the theoretical and analytical challenges for
[students of international relations and politics, are
intertwined]{.underline}.

[Hundreds of think tanks]{.underline} have not taken root in the United
States because of a perceived shortage of policy expertise. They
[have]{.underline} [proliferated]{.underline}, if we follow the logic of
Simon and Stevenson\'s argument, [because of a **lack of *specialized*
expertise**]{.underline}. [New think tanks may be required to address
the complex set of issues that have arisen]{.underline} in the
post---September I Ith world, [just as think tanks were created before
and after World War II to assist policy-makers to
**confront**]{.underline} a wide range of economic, social, and
**[security concerns]{.underline}**. What Simon and Stevenson are
suggesting is not radically different from what Robert Brookings, Andrew
Carnegie, and a group of engineers at Project Rand proposed decades ago.
[The rise of think tanks is]{.underline} also [closely associated
with]{.underline} [the type of expertise]{.underline} and services [they
offer and their ability to satisfy the needs of
policy-makers]{.underline}, journalists, opinion leaders,
philanthropists, and corporate and private donors [in ways that other
institutions]{.underline} engaged in research and analysis
[cannot]{.underline}. For example, [unlike university
professors]{.underline}, who in most instances must balance the demands
of teaching, research, and administration, [policy experts at think
tanks have the luxury of concentrating on]{.underline} what they do best
--- [monitoring, analyzing, and commenting on timely and relevant policy
issues]{.underline}. [Experts at think tanks]{.underline} often publish
books and articles that [stimulate discussion in the academic community,
but they]{.underline} [are]{.underline} concerned primarily with
[generating a range of research products]{.underline} that will be [of
immediate interest to policy-makers]{.underline} and to the public. They
cannot afford, as their colleagues in universities often can, to invest
five, ten, or even fifteen years on a research project. Moreover, most
private or independent think tanks do not have the luxury of relying, as
many academics at universities do, on government support for their
research. Although a handful of prominent think tanks continue to draw
heavily on government funding, many, including the vast majority of
advocacy think tanks, look to philanthropic foundations, corporations,
and private donors for assistance. Furthermore, like the institutes they
fund, donors have a vested interest in influencing the political climate
of the day. This in large part explains why so many advocacy think tanks
have been created over the past several decades. They have struck a
responsive chord with donors who are prepared to support their vision of
how the United States ought to be governed. [Experts at think tanks
understand the importance of responding to the needs of policy-makers
and therefore **make this a priority**]{.underline}. They need not be
reminded that securing a captive audience on Capitol Hill and/or in the
White House can pay handsome dividends. By contrast, scholars at
universities are rarely concerned about meeting the daily demands of
policy-makers. Instead, they prefer to engage in long-term research in
the hope that their findings, based on years of rigorous analysis, will
help to advance the public interest. In short, scholars working at think
tanks and universities have very different priorities, objectives, and
timelines. **[This is why]{.underline}** **[universities cannot be a
substitute for think tanks]{.underline}** and why think tanks cannot
take the place of universities.

[The U.S. response to Russian meddling]{.underline} in the 2016 election
[has been]{.underline} **[extraordinarily weak]{.underline}**. Not only
that, [it has been accompanied by]{.underline} an attitude of
"**[whataboutism]{.underline}**" [on the part of some

the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[has]{.underline} **[little ground to complain]{.underline}** about
Russia's actions [given its own **history** of meddling in other
countries' political campaigns]{.underline} and elections. [It is
certainly **essential**]{.underline} [to be honest and realistic about
the considerable record of past U.S. electoral meddling]{.underline},
and the contrast between Russia and the United States in this domain is
certainly not black and white. [Yet neither is it one of
**indistinguishable shades of gray**]{.underline}. The United States is
simply not engaging in electoral meddling in a manner comparable to
Russia's approach.

THE PAST IS NOT THE PRESENT

[**Two key flaws** underlie relativist accounts]{.underline}. First,
such a position fails to distinguish adequately between the pattern of
U.S. interventionism during the Cold War, on the one hand, and U.S.
activity since the end of the Cold War on the other. During the former
period, [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [did indeed illegitimately intervene in
numerous foreign elections,]{.underline} trying to tilt outcomes in
favor of candidates the United States preferred and in a smaller number
of cases laboring to oust legitimately elected leaders Washington saw as
hostile to its security and economic interests. The record is long and
dark, marked by some especially well-known cases in Guatemala and Iran
in the early 1950s and in Chile and Nicaragua in the 1970s and 1980s.

[Since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}, however, [such
interventionism has **decreased significantly** because U.S.
policymakers no longer view the world as enmeshed in a]{.underline}
**[global ideological struggle]{.underline}** [in which every
country]{.underline}, no matter how small, [is a critical piece on a
larger **strategic chessboard**]{.underline}. Washington has thus become
much less concerned about the outcomes of most foreign elections and
much less engaged in trying to tilt them in any particular direction.

Of course, one can identify a few cases over the past 25 years when the
United States has tried to manipulate foreign elections with the aim of
getting its preferred candidate into power. When Russian President Boris
Yeltsin faced reelection in 1996, the Clinton administration mobilized
some economic relief to Yeltsin, to try to help him win. In the
Palestinian elections of 2006, the George W. Bush administration
employed U.S. economic assistance to try to bolster Fatah in its contest
with Hamas (with predictably counterproductive results). In the lead up
to the 2005 Iraqi elections, the Bush administration formulated a plan
to funnel covert funds to favored Iraqi candidates and parties but
reportedly backed away from the plan after Congress objected. In 2009,
according to former Defense Secretary Robert Gates' memoir, the United
States worked behind the scenes prior to the Afghanistan elections to
push President Hamid Karzai aside and keep him from winning.

There have no doubt been other cases, known only to those with access to
classified information. Yet [**on the whole**, U.S. electoral meddling
has **decreased significantly**]{.underline} since the Cold War years.
[This is true because of the change in U.S. **interests** and because of
an **evolution of norms**]{.underline} [in many parts of the U.S. policy
establishment about the acceptability of such actions.]{.underline} The
overall picture today is of a [Russia actively expanding its covert
electoral meddling in multiple regions as U.S. meddling **continues to
decline.**]{.underline} Those convinced that Washington must still
routinely use covert means to influence election outcomes all around the
world should consider the available evidence: in the last few years the
rising pattern of [Russian efforts to **manipulate the political life**
of]{.underline} countries in central **[Europe]{.underline}**, western
Europe, the Balkans, [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [and]{.underline} **[Latin
America]{.underline}** [has left many telltale
**fingerprints**]{.underline}---[it seems highly unlikely Washington
could have carried out a **similar pattern** of activities and not leave
behind at least **some noticeable traces**]{.underline} of them.

WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT DEMOCRACY PROMOTION?

A second problematic element of [the relativist position is the charge
that U.S. efforts to **promote democracy**]{.underline} abroad---which
make use of diplomatic leverage, democracy aid, and cooperation with
pro-democratic multilateral organizations---[are just another, more
**covert form**]{.underline} [of electoral meddling]{.underline} akin to
what the Russians are doing. Russian President Vladimir
**[Putin]{.underline}** [is a **strong subscriber to this
viewpoint**]{.underline}, convinced that U.S. and other Western
democracy programs in his country represent efforts to manipulate its
domestic political life against him. Many Western observers---acutely
aware of the long record of U.S. interventionism---have their suspicions
as well.

[U.S. pro-democracy diplomacy and assistance do indeed seek to shape the
political direction of other countries]{.underline}. And they are
carried out with a strong sense of self-interest, not out of unalloyed
idealism. They are driven by the belief that democratic outcomes abroad
will generally be favorable to U.S. security and economic interests by
producing stable governments amenable to deeper partnerships thanks to
shared political values. But unlike Russian electoral meddling, [U.S.
democracy promotion does not seek to **exacerbate** sociopolitical
**divisions**]{.underline}, [systematically spread
**lies**]{.underline}, [favor **particular candidates**, or undercut the
technical **integrity of elections**]{.underline}. On the whole, [it
seeks to help citizens exercise their basic **political**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[civil rights]{.underline}** in electoral processes,
enhance the technical integrity of such processes, and increase
electoral transparency.

**[Skeptics]{.underline}** reluctant to accept the idea that democracy
diplomacy and assistance are not about manipulating elections [should
look at some **recent cases**---such as U.S. efforts to
support]{.underline} **[Tunisia]{.underline}**'s democratic evolution,
[to help]{.underline} **[Gambia]{.underline}** resolve the blockage that
followed its 2016 elections, [to encourage the]{.underline}
**[Hungarian]{.underline}** [government to respect media freedom and
civic space, and to push the **Myanmar military**]{.underline} [at the
start of this decade to make room for at least some **democratic
political life**]{.underline} in the country.

Skeptics should also note that although the [U.S. organizations
**engaged in democracy**]{.underline} work are mostly funded by the U.S.
government itself, they [are **regularly at odds** with the preferences
of U.S. **diplomats**]{.underline}, [who often hold on to relationships
with **friendly autocrats**]{.underline}, as they are wary of the
strategic value of democratic change. In the mid-1990s, [this was true
in]{.underline} **[Indonesia]{.underline}** [under]{.underline} former
President **[Suharto]{.underline}** [and in **Kazakhstan**]{.underline}
[under]{.underline} President Nursultan **[Nazarbayev]{.underline}**.
And in the first decade of this century, [the same occurred in
**Egypt**]{.underline} [under]{.underline} former President Hosni
[Mubarak and in]{.underline} **[Azerbaijan]{.underline}**
[under]{.underline} the **[Aliyev]{.underline}** family. Skeptics should
also bear in mind that in most cases where [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is
engaged]{.underline} in promoting democracy abroad, it is working
[alongside]{.underline} and sometimes in active partnership with [other
democracies not known for geopolitical **interventionism**]{.underline},
[such as Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden]{.underline}.

GRAY AREAS Although the overall case is strong for distinguishing U.S.
democracy support abroad from the sort of political meddling that Russia
is now making a habit of, there are several difficult issues that
necessarily complicate the comparison. First, in a small but important
number of cases, the United States does assist one side of a contested
electoral campaign against the other. This occurs when a strongman
leader of doubtful democratic fidelity is trying to legitimate himself
and perpetuate his rule through elections. In various such cases, as
with Chilean President Augusto Pinochet's plebiscite in 1988, Slobodan
Milosevic's reelection campaign in 2000, and various Belarusian
elections in the 2000s, the United States and a number of other Western
actors offered assistance both to the opposition political forces
challenging the strongman and to civic groups that were mobilizing
get-out-the-vote campaigns. From the Western point of view, such actions
are not interfering in a free and fair election but rather trying to
help level the playing field in an election that is stacked unfairly
against the challengers. From the point of view of the power holders, of
course, the United States and its allies are trying to shape the outcome
of the election in a partisan fashion. Second, although U.S. and other
Western assistance to civil society aims to aid civic actors in their
advocacy of rights and democracy---not to take sides in partisan
political struggles and campaigns---the line between political society
and civil society is often blurry. What to Western providers are
principled civic actors working to advance universally valid political
and civil rights and democratic values such as transparency and
accountability, are to local authorities political animals cloaked in
civic garb challenging their hold on power. This is especially true in
partially or fully closed political environments such as exist in
Cambodia and Venezuela, where regimes have choked off the opposition and
demonstrated an ability to undermine elections. Third, despite the fact
that most U.S. and Western democracy promotion is carried out in a
transparent manner, some aid providers are becoming less transparent in
their assistance in order to protect their recipients from being
harassed or persecuted. As a result, a growing number of regimes have
accused the West of engaging in clandestine political meddling. This
scenario creates a vicious cycle in which undemocratic regimes charge
democracy promoters of secretive meddling and persecute those they work
with, thus driving such organizations to adopt less transparent methods.
This in turn further reinforces the perception of secretive meddling.
U.S. democracy assistance directed at Iran, for example, has become much
less transparent over the past ten years as crackdowns by the Iranian
government on recipients of foreign assistance have intensified. Fourth,
U.S. democracy policy is markedly inconsistent, even though U.S. efforts
to promote democracy in other countries are generally driven by genuine
pro-democracy motives. The U.S. government makes more funds available
for democracy programs in countries that the United States views as
strategic enemies, such as Iran and Cuba, than it does in nondemocratic
countries the United States views as strategic partners, such as Saudi
Arabia and Ethiopia. The inconsistency is not absolute. Washington does
make some efforts to promote democracy and rights in states ruled by
"friendly tyrants." The Trump administration's decision last year to
withhold some U.S. assistance to Egypt as a means of expressing
dissatisfaction with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's antidemocratic
policies is just one example. And the fact that one is inconsistent in
applying the principle does not render meaningless the applications that
are made. Nevertheless, the inconsistency hurts the larger case that
democracy promotion has real roots in principle.

DIVERGENT PATHS

[It is not yet clear what it will take for the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to move forward in
putting together an **effective response**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[Russian electoral meddling]{.underline}**, [but dispensing with the
argument that Washington has **no moral standing for
objecting**]{.underline} to such [actions is certainly **one necessary
step**.]{.underline} The arguments over "whataboutism" merit some
careful reflection and assessment given that the facts are not simple
and not all the facts are available. [The **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} [does have a past record of electoral
meddling]{.underline}, particularly during the Cold War. Yet [the trends
of U.S. and Russian behavior are **divergent**,]{.underline} not
convergent---[with Russia on the **negative side of the
divide**]{.underline}. And although the domain of [U.S. democracy
promotion is hardly]{.underline} free of flaws and serious past
mistakes, it is not [the **dark twin** of the illicit, covert election
meddling that Russia]{.underline} [seems intent on making one of its
**defining signatures abroad**]{.underline}.

### At: Structures Inevitable

#### Structures are not inevitable, but rather alterable through responsible political decision-making 

**Zanotti 17**---Associate Professor Department of Political Science,
Virginia Tech (Laura, "Reorienting IR: Ontological Entanglement, Agency,
and Ethics," International Studies Review, January 13, 2017)

In this article, I have argued that in order for IR to remain
politically relevant and critical, we must rethink and reflect on the
ontological, epistemological, and methodological assumptions of the
discipline. I then explored how [**onto-epistemologies**, ethics, and
political agency are **interlinked**]{.underline}. Ontologies of
entanglement tend to embrace complex conceptualizations of causality and
the morphogenetic properties of what exist. In a quantum world,
ontological cuts happen in practices. [This]{.underline} worldview
[invites a **reconsideration** of the way we **justify**]{.underline}
and address [**political decisions** and **ethical action** beyond the
**universalism** supported by atomistic ontologies and the **stifling
limits** imposed by substantialist-structuralism]{.underline}. As Nick
Onuf has argued, "In a straightened world, as [in a world in turmoil,
talk of universal principles **rings hollow**]{.underline}... [In such a
world, positional ethics is the **best we can hope for**]{.underline}"
(Onuf forthcoming, quoted with permission).

[A quantum reconceptualization of our being in the world and our
relation to matter calls for a **profound sense of modesty**, as well as
for the **central role of responsibility** for taking political
decisions. In an entangled world that is **not governed** by
**theoretically detectable**, **linear**, and **immutable laws** of
history, but instead by **intra-agential processes**, the conditions of
possibility for political agency are rooted in]{.underline} the
morphogenetic properties of **[practices]{.underline}**. Taking
responsibility for critically questioning what exists without the hubris
of assuming our ability to ordain outcomes displays an affinity with
Foucault's methodological and political project. In this vein, [ethical
guidelines **may not be grounded on abstractions** stemming from the
solitary ruminations of an individual's mind]{.underline}. [Prudence,
responsibility]{.underline}, and practices of cultivation of the self
[offer pathways to **overcome the limitations** of]{.underline} the
Kantian categorical imperative by which **[universal
prescriptions]{.underline}** are the main way of validating ethical
choices. As Patomäki has shown, [universalism may elicit
**exclusionary** and **violent practices**]{.underline}. Moreover, as
Connolly has argued, [the nostalgia for a slowly moving world regulated
by **linear relations of causality** and characterized by **certainty**
and **stability** may be the **root of fundamentalism**.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [if we accept]{.underline} Barad's position [that we are
"**of the world**" and not **above the world**, theorizing looks more
like a practice endowed with **performative political effects** than a
**quest** for the discovery of the "**true nature**" of what
exists]{.underline}. Therefore, [intellectual undertakings are a **form
of political agency** and come with **great responsibility**. Such
responsibility **requires** the need for **exercising prudence** in
making truth statements about what is **universally good** or
**naturally inevitable**. Assumptions about]{.underline} linearity of
causal relations, **[universal]{.underline}** laws of history, or
**[ontological properties]{.underline}** of entities [yield]{.underline}
two [**problematic effects**. On the one hand, they may **stifle
political imagination**; on the other hand, they could encourage actions
based upon **abstract prescriptions** rather than upon **careful
diagnosis** of the forces that obtain in the situation at hand. In an
entangled world, **there are no externalities**. Arguments that **divert
responsibility** by basing political choices upon **abstract
principles** or **aspirations** and]{.underline}, as a result, [that
treat **what happens on the ground** as "**unintended consequences**" or
"**collateral damage**," are **ethically thin** and **politically
dangerous**.]{.underline}

In fact, [**unintended consequences** may well be the result of
**irresponsible political decision-making** that does not include a
**competent assessment** of the **practical configurations** that
constitute the **context of action** and the **means necessary** to
achieve stated goals. Such attitudes]{.underline}, Amoureux and Steele
(2014) have suggested, [have led to **disastrous initiatives**, such as
the **Bush administration's invasion of Iraq**]{.underline}. Likewise,
Kennedy (2006) has shown that [the]{.underline} bland
[rhetoric]{.underline} of jus in bello that provides standardized
criteria regarding the number of acceptable civilian casualties
(conveniently called collateral damage) [produces the effect of
**diverting responsibility** from those who conduct war while
**assuaging their consciences** concerning the injuries and deaths their
choices are inflicting]{.underline}. Kennedy (2004) has also shown that
[as a result of the preference for **universal normativity**,
the]{.underline} human rights [profession]{.underline} (which he calls
"the invisible college") [is more concerned with **protecting abstract
norms** than with **acting politically** so as to **devise viable
solutions** to **specific problems**.]{.underline}

Universal norms and bureaucratic routines play a major role in
prescribing and justifying UN peacekeeping interventions. As Jean Marie
Guehénno argued more than a decade ago, strategies of international
intervention based upon assumptions of causal linearity and invariance
may amount to hubris. Norms and rules can also offer grounds for
appeasement. The massacres that occurred in Rwanda and Srebrenica in the
1990s provide examples of how, by uncritically following
institutionalized rules, United Nations peacekeepers permitted
atrocities. UN employees are not cold-blooded monsters or extremely
callous individuals. They follow norms and rules, key examples of which
include the principle of "impartiality," Security Council mandates, and
"rules of engagement." By doing so, however, they have often fallen
short of considering the possible consequences of decisions in specific
situations. The United Nations' failure to take action to prevent the
Rwanda and Srebrenica genocide testifies to the fact that following
universal norms (i.e., the imperative to preserve impartiality) and
bureaucratic reasoning (i.e., the rules of engagement prescribing not to
intervene to disarm any party of the conflict) set the stage for
avoiding a careful assessment of what was at stake on the eve of the
massacres. These ways of reasoning also appeased consciences for not
making decisions accountable to the people in danger (Zanotti 2014).

Significantly, [the **lack of prudence** that derives from **broad
overgeneralizations** and **reliance on abstractions**, **rather** than
**careful consideration** of **what the case demands**, threatens **more
self-defeating outcomes** in peacekeeping and international politics.
This is why a **careful reflection** of the ways our political choices
are **validated ontologically** and **epistemologically** is of
**paramount practical importance**]{.underline}. Seven decades ago, Carr
(1946) advocated the need for conceptualizing political agency and
ethics in a way that addresses both the limits of the idealist illusion
regarding the possibility to transform reality through acts of will as
well as the realist persuasion about the inescapable subordination of
actors to external conditions. Both of [these positions]{.underline},
Carr pointed out, [lead to **self-defeating outcomes** and **stifle
political imagination** because they **focus on general abstractions**,
**failing** to take into consideration what conditions and political
opportunity **actually obtain** in **specific historical
configurations**]{.underline}.

Here I have proposed that [an ontology of entanglement fosters an
**ethic of engagement** and **activism**]{.underline} along the lines
suggested by Foucault and opens up possibilities for political action.
In this ontological horizon, [what qualifies as meaningful agency is
**not stifled** by]{.underline} the structuralist commitment to the
stabilizing effects of structures (like in Waltz's) or by [the
**inescapable features** of an **oppressive** and **alienating social
order** that **dispossess subjects of their humanity** and **reduces
them to "bare life"**]{.underline} (as in Agamben). Instead,
[micropolitical interventions]{.underline}, parrēsia, and the
cultivation of a particular kind of character, [**while not
revolutionizing the status quo**, may be relevant to **triggering social
change**]{.underline}. Importantly, [ontologies of entanglement also
**raise the bar** for **adjudicating** the **ethical validity of
political choices**. Radical assumption of responsibility **drastically
limits what is acceptable** as "**unintended consequences**." This is
**important** for]{.underline} the way international organizations make
decisions regarding international peacekeeping interventions and for
[**the way politicians decide to wage war**. **Ethically** and
**politically sound** decision-making **cannot** be based mainly
upon]{.underline} the apodictic recognition of universal rules of
behavior, [**abstract aspirations**, or **overarching theories** of the
functioning of society. They must also include **careful analysis** of
how]{.underline} clusters of [causes may **generate effects** in the
**specific contexts** at hand and **take responsibility**
for]{.underline} the ontological cuts [our initiatives]{.underline}
operate [and for the]{.underline} morphogenetic [processes they may set
off.]{.underline}
