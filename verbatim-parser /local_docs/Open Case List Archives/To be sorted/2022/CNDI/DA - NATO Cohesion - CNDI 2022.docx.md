[While]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin's war of
aggression]{.underline} against Ukraine [has reinvigorated
the]{.underline} Atlantic [alliance]{.underline}, it [has]{.underline}
also [deepened Europe's strategic dependence on the United
States]{.underline}. As North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO]{.underline}) allies continue to help Ukraine beat back Russia's
assault, they [must]{.underline} also a[ddress this important
longer-term challenge of rebalancing trans-Atlantic
defense]{.underline}. [Doing so means squaring]{.underline} a triangle
of issues: ensuring [Europe's capacity to defend itself]{.underline}
against Russia and manage a range of additional crises, many along its
southern periphery; [addressing European aspirations for]{.underline}
greater strategic [autonomy]{.underline}; [and maintaining confidence
that the United States can adequately uphold its
commitments]{.underline} in both the north Atlantic and the
Indo-Pacific.\[1\]2¶ Advancing greater European strategic responsibility
starts by defining the concept in a way designed to strengthen the
Atlantic alliance. It should focus on two military goals. First,
[European allies should build their conventional military capabilities
t]{.underline}o a level that would provide half of the forces and
capabilities, including the strategic enablers, required for deterrence
and collective defense against major-power aggression. Second, European
[allies should develop capabilities to conduct crisis management
operations in Europe's neighborhood without today's heavy reliance on
U.S]{.underline}. [enablers]{.underline} such as strategic lift,
refueling, and command, control, communications, computers,
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR).

#### Shifting NATO strategy to increased focus on tech undermines cohesion- NATO members may agree broadly, but disagree over specific approaches

Security Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis;

Leadership in NATO: A Rocky Return but a Firm Future;

[The concept]{.underline} [is]{.underline} a guiding document, now under
development, [intended to revitalise NATO's purpose and core tasks for
the future]{.underline}. After former US President Donald Trump's and
French President Emmanuel Macron's respective accusations of NATO being
"obsolete" and "brain dead", [the alliance is in grave need of a new
concept that brings the US and Europe togethe]{.underline}r to tackle
the security challenges of today and tomorrow. [The
problem,]{.underline} however**[, is that the two sides are not entirely
coordinated on how to do that.]{.underline}**¶ Compared to the Trump
era, divisions among the allies are not nearly as evident. But [given
Washington's growing focus on the Indo-Pacific over Europe and flawed
coordination efforts thus far, **its allies have some doubts about how
America's intentions regarding NATO will mesh with their
own**.]{.underline} [Europe]{.underline}, for its part, [is in some ways
stronger than ever]{.underline}---thanks to four years of consolidating
its own interests and capabilities in response to growing US
unpredictability. **[Now, it finds itself sometimes at odds with
Washington over key issues such as]{.underline}** China, strategic
autonomy and even **[technology]{.underline}**. Simultaneously, it is
more capable of defending its positions. [Given the domestic political
volatility in the US, its allies are skeptical about what US decisions
will last through the next presidential elections]{.underline}. This
means their own decisions matter even more. [All of these dynamics
complicate the crafting of NATO's future common agenda.]{.underline}¶
Nevertheless, the Biden administration remains committed to NATO.
President Joe Biden and his team believe America and its allies are at a
historical inflection point. In the strategic competition with China and
Russia, they view NATO as a great advantage. They see the strategic
concept drafting process as a critical opportunity to make NATO work
better in this environment---to serve not only US interests, but the
shared interests of its allies and partners. [For the US, adapting NATO
for strategic competition will mean closing a decades-long chapter of
out-of-area operations in favour of investing more in cyber and
technological capabilities.]{.underline} It will require empowering
Europe to be a more equal partner in defence, as well as creating more
global partnership platforms to support allied objectives beyond the
Euro-Atlantic sphere. It will also involve reinforcing the shared
democratic values that unite NATO allies against their authoritarian
challengers[. To these ends, the US has a robust list of priorities for
NATO's next Strategic Concept.]{.underline}

Russia-NATO Conflict: Implications for Deterrence Stability,"

Escalation: Can a NATO - Russia conflict be managed?¶ [Once a conflict
was **under way**, the "**fog of war**" and **rising unpredictability**
would **inevitably** set in, **complicating** the implementation of
any]{.underline} predetermined theories of escalation, deescalation and
inter-[conflict management. The **actual** dynamics of]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline} and the perceptions of the stakes involved [are
**extremely difficult** to predict. Simulations]{.underline} and
table-top exercises can [give]{.underline} only [limited
insights]{.underline} into the actual decision-making processes and
interactions.¶ Still, [Russian military theorists]{.underline} and
practitioners seem to **[assume]{.underline}** that [a conflict with
NATO can be **managed** and **controlled** in a way that would bring it
to a **swift end** consistent with Russian aims. The Russian **theory of
victory**]{.underline} would [seek to **exploit weak points** in an
Alliance war effort. Based on the **conviction** that democracies are
weak and]{.underline} their leaders and populations are [risk-averse,
Russia may **assume** that]{.underline} its [threats of **horizontal**
or **vertical escalation** could be]{.underline} particularly
[effective. It would]{.underline} also [try to bring home the
notion]{.underline} that [it has **much higher stakes** in the
conflict]{.underline} (regime survival) [than]{.underline} a majority of
the [NATO members]{.underline} involved, [and]{.underline} thus [will be
ready to **push the boundaries** of]{.underline} the [conflict further.
It would]{.underline} most likely [try to **test** and **exploit**
potential **divisions** within the Alliance, combining **selective
diplomacy** and **activation** of its intelligence assets
in]{.underline} some [NATO states]{.underline} with a degree of
selectivity in terms of targets of particular attacks.¶ [**Any**
NATO-Russia conflict would **inevitably** have a **nuclear dimension**.
The role of **nuclear weapons** as a tool for **escalation control** for
Russia has been]{.underline} thoroughly [debated by experts, but
when]{.underline} and how [Russia might use]{.underline} (and not merely
showcase or activate) [nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an **open
question**. Beyond]{.underline} catch phrases such as ["**escalate to
de-escalate**"]{.underline} or "escalate to win" [there are a **wider
range** of options for Russian **nuclear weapon use**]{.underline}. For
example, [a single **nuclear warning shot** could be lethal or
non-lethal. It could be directed against a]{.underline} purely [military
target or a]{.underline} military-[civilian one. Detonation could be
configured for an **EMP effect**. A "**false flag**" attack
is]{.underline} also [conceivable. These options]{.underline} might be
used to [**signal escalation** and could **significantly complicate**
NATO's responses]{.underline}.¶ Neither NATO nor its member states have
developed a similar theory of victory. Public NATO documents stipulate
the general goals for the Alliance: defend against any armed attack and,
as needed, restore the full sovereignty and territorial integrity of
member states. [It is less clear how far the Alliance would be **willing
to escalate** the conflict]{.underline} to achieve these goals, [and
what mechanisms]{.underline} and means [it would use while trying to
maintain]{.underline} some degree of [control]{.underline} over the
conflict.¶ [The goals]{.underline} and methods [of waging a conflict
with Russia would]{.underline} probably [have to be limited in order to
avoid a **massive nuclear exchange**. Such limitations]{.underline}
would also involve restrictions on striking back against targets on
Russian territory. But too narrow an approach [could put **too much
restraint** on NATO's operations: the Russian **regime's stability**
may]{.underline} ultimately [need to be threatened]{.underline} in order
[to **force the leadership** into **terminating** the
conflict]{.underline}. NATO would thus need to establish what a
proportional self-defence response to Russian actions would involve, and
to what extent cyber operations or attacks against military targets in
quite different parts of Russia would be useful as tools of escalation
to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover, individual NATO Allies, especially
those directly affected by Russia's actions, might pursue their
individual strategies of escalation.¶ With regards to the nuclear
dimension in NATO escalation plans, given the stakes involved, this
element would most likely be handled by the three nuclear-weapon members
of the Alliance, with the US taking the lead. The existence of three
independent centres of nuclear decision-making could be exploited to
complicate Russian planning and introduce uncertainty into the Russian
strategic calculus, but some degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination
would be beneficial. This coordination would not necessarily focus on
nuclear targeting, but rather on designing coordinated operations to
demonstrate resolve in order to keep the conflict below the nuclear
threshold, or bring it back under the threshold after first use.¶
[Relying on concepts of **escalation control**]{.underline} and on
lessons [from the Cold War]{.underline} confrontation [might be
**misleading**. The circumstances in which a **Russia-NATO conflict**
would play out would be **radically different** from the 20th
century]{.underline} screenplay. Moreover, [instead of
**gradual**]{.underline} (linear) [escalation or **salami tactics**
escalation, it is possible to imagine]{.underline} surprizing ["**leap
frog**" escalation]{.underline}, possibly [connected]{.underline} with
actions [in **different domains**]{.underline} (e.g. a cyberattack
against critical infrastructure). Flexibility, good intelligence and
inventiveness in responding to such developments would be crucial.¶
Conflict termination¶ [Russian and NATO assumptions regarding conflict
termination would]{.underline} most likely [**not survive** the **first
hours** of]{.underline} an [actual conflict. Both sides are capable of
**underestimating** the **resolve** of the other side to
prevail]{.underline} in a conflict [and the other side's **willingness**
to]{.underline} commit the necessary resources and [endure the costs,
especially once both]{.underline} sides [start committing]{.underline}
their [political capital]{.underline} and resources and the casualties
accumulate.

#### Expanding NATO security strategy risks undermining the alliance's core defense of conventional deterrence

From crisis management back to collective defence International security
institutions have often been faced with the difficulty of calibrating
their own sphere of operation so that they respond to the concerns of
their member states and meet the intent of their original mandate. This
is what congruence is about. It draws on the comparative advantages of
the organisation under consideration, analysed against the evolution of
the security environment and member states' policies. One aspect of this
debate relates to how an institution and its member states define the
scope of activities to be covered; how specialised versus how
broad-ranging an institution's mandate must be (See Koremenos et al.
2001, Guzman 2013). This, in turn, feeds into the adaptation process, as
a particular balance of activities may need to be changed to respond to
new needs. [With the end of the Cold War NATO has been faced with this
debate in different ways: with the embrace of crisis management in the
early 1990s at a time when collective defence was no longer central (See
Rupp 2000, Galen Carpenter 2001); with the counter-terrorism turn
post-911; and more recently with the move back to collective defence in
the aftermath of the Ukraine crisis]{.underline} in 2014. Back in the
early 1990s, NATO's purpose was deeply challenged, most notably due to
the fading away of its collective defence core task, and the mismatch
that it implied between the Alliance's character as a defence actor and
the nature of the security needs. NATO needed to adapt. This debate,
both in academic and policy circles, raised existential questions about
NATO's nature and purpose (see McCalla 1996, Wallander 2000, Menon and
Welsh 2011). This was inter alia encapsulated by the "out of area or out
of business" formula, by US Senator Richard Lugar (1993), which implied
that crisis management operations con- ducted outside of the North
Atlantic area were a response to the risk of irrelevance pro- voked by
the absence of an existential threat. Crisis management was undoubtedly
important; as a matter of fact, crisis management operations in the
1990s and 2000s were by far the most visible NATO activity (Frantzen
2005, Edström and Gyllensporre 2012). Yet these operations were also
challenges to NATO's core defence function. [Among the key questions
raised was that of the need for NATO to adapt to a constantly evolving
security environment, **yet raising the risk that embracing an increas-
ingly broader security mandate would undermine NATO's core defence
character**]{.underline}. The "winning the peace" agenda would not
substitute or even complement the war-fighting core role without
(negative) consequences for the latter (Yost 1998, Nelson 2006). In a
post-911 context, the role of NATO in counter-terrorism (CT) raised
similar ques- tions. NATO had to adapt to the new environment, and thus
respond to the terrorist threat (for which its Article 5 had been
invoked for the first time), yet the comparative advantage of the
Alliance in CT was not obvious to everyone, both for political and oper-
ational reasons (Valasek 2001/2002). These two examples of crisis
management and counter-terrorism show how an adap- tation process can
generate side-effects that in the end may increase the vulnerability of
the institution, through maladaptation. In this context, [2014 has been
a key moment in NATO's congruence quest (Webber et al. 2014). The 2014
Ukraine crisis and with it the annexation of Crimea by Russia have
signifi- cantly changed the European security landscape and, for
European security actors, their own perception of threats. While Russia
was beforehand seen as a partner by most Euro- pean states (NATO 2012,
para. 36),1 the Ukraine crisis brought it back to the category of
threats]{.underline}. [The New Cold War had begun]{.underline} (Lucas
2008, Trenin 2014, Kroenig 2015). **[For NATO, this meant a return to
the so-called deterrence and defence agenda,2 and to the core task of
collective defence]{.underline}**, as defined in the 2010 Strategic
Concept (NATO 2010). A few months after the annexation of Crimea, NATO
member states meet at the Wales Summit, and state that "Russia's
aggressive actions against Ukraine have fundamentally challenged our
vision of a Europe whole, free, and at peace" (NATO 2014, para. 1), and
that "the greatest responsibility of the Alliance is to protect and
defend our territories and our populations against attack, as set out in
Article 5 of the Washington Treaty" (NATO 2014, para. [2). **Since then
most of NATO's attention has been towards the menace of a resurgent
Russia**]{.underline}, be it in terms of narrative (or securitisation
process) and policy-making, capability development, military posture or
exercises (see Ringsmose and Rynning 2017), leading NATO's Secretary
General to talk about "the largest reinforcement of our collective
defence" since the end of the Cold War (NATO Secretary General 2018).
Decisions taken include (Turner 2019): the strengthening of NATO's rapid
reaction forces, with the trebling of the size of the NATO Response
Force, and the creation of a "spearhead force" within it, known as the
Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF); the deployment of
multinational battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland,
known as the enhanced Forward Presence (eFP); the increasing of the
exercise programme, with a new stress on collective defence exercises;
the adoption of the NATO Readiness Initiative that aims at increasing
the readiness of NATO forces with an additional 30 manoeuvre battalions,
30 major naval combatants and 30 kinetic air squadrons, with enabling
forces, at 30 days' readiness; and the building of resilience, including
defence against cyber-attacks and other forms of "hybrid" attacks.

North Atlantic Treaty Organization (**[NATO]{.underline}**).
[Russia's]{.underline} ongoing war of naked [aggression against
Ukraine]{.underline}, [a NATO non-member state, should]{.underline} put
to [rest any]{.underline} lingering [questions about the modern utility
of the Alliance]{.underline} and about which threat should be the focus

must lead the Alliance to]{.underline} a [wholesale refocusing on the
organization's raison d'être of collective defense]{.underline}. While
the Alliance faces challenges emanating from an unstable Mediterranean
basin and terrorism originating from the Middle East, the fact remains
that **[Russia continues to be the only existential threat to member
states]{.underline}**. [**NATO must** send a strong signal that it is
**strengthen**ing **deterrence measures explicitly in response to** the
increased **threat from Russia.**]{.underline} Deterrence measures
should include an Alliance-wide recommitment to defense spending; a
persistent and continuing U.S. presence in Eastern European member
states; updated Alliance operational planning in light of Russia's
position in Belarus and Ukraine; and an increase in U.S. air, ground,
and naval forces in the European theater as a sign of continued
commitment to the NATO treaty's Article 5. These deterrence measures
must be carried out with the recognition that, from a long-term
perspective, China is the largest peer challenger from whom the U.S.
must expect hostile action. Any improvements to the U.S. force posture
must not be to the detriment of the nation's ability to counter China.
From the Arctic to the Levant, [Russia remains an aggressive and capable
threat to NATO]{.underline} and the interests of its members. For member
states [in Eastern Europe, Russia represents a]{.underline} real and
potentially **[existential threat]{.underline}**. [Russia's entrenched
position in Belarus, along with]{.underline} its ongoing [actions to
cleave Ukraine, a nation that borders four NATO members,]{.underline} in
two, [scramble the geostrategic map of Europe]{.underline} and
necessitate changes to NATO operational planning, [exemplifying the need
for the Alliance to take swift and resolute steps to bolster deterrence
measures along its eastern flank.]{.underline}

#### NATO's strategy centers the conventional deterrence of Russian aggression

DAVID M. **HERSZENHORN June 29, 2022**

NATO leaders brand Russia a 'direct threat' in new strategy blueprint;
Politico;
https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-leader-adopt-strategy-blueprint-branding-russia-direct-threat/

[NATO leaders]{.underline} meeting in Madrid [adopted a new strategic
blueprint on Wednesday bluntly branding Russia as "the most significant
and direct threat to Allies' security]{.underline} and to peace and
stability in the Euro-Atlantic area."¶ [The unvarnished labeling of
Russia as a clear and present danger in NATO's new "Strategic
Concept]{.underline}" --- a once-in-a-decade planning document ---
[represents the leaders' formal verdict on President Vladimir Putin's
brutal invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}, which brought full-scale war to
Europe for the first time in the 21st century.¶ At a news conference
announcing NATO leaders' initial decisions at their meeting in Madrid,
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg hailed the landmark decision by
Finland and Sweden to abandon decades of non-alignment and join NATO.¶
Stoltenberg triumphantly welcomed the two Nordic countries, which got a
green light on Tuesday night to join the alliance after weeks of
obstruction by Turkey. Stoltenberg said the expected expansion showed
Putin's war had backfired and that the Russian dictator had failed in
his goal of preventing the alliance from adding new members.¶ "The
decision to invite Finland and Sweden to become members demonstrates
that NATO's door is open," Stoltenberg said. "It demonstrates that
President Putin did not succeed in closing NATO's door. NATO's door
remains open. And it also demonstrates that we respect the sovereign
right of every nation to choose their path."¶ Of course, Putin's main
objection was to prevent Ukraine from joining the alliance. And, for now
at least, he has succeeded in dashing any lingering aspirations in Kyiv
to join the alliance.¶ [NATO powers, led by the U.S., have made clear
that they do not want to be drawn into a direct conflict in Russia, at
least partly because of fear that Putin would use a nuclear
weapon]{.underline}. And while allies have insisted that, theoretically,
Ukraine has every right to pursue NATO membership, there is no chance
the war-ravaged country will be able to join any time soon, if ever.
That's because NATO's collective defense clause, known as Article 5,
would immediately require the allies to join the fight against Russia.¶
Stoltenberg, at his news conference, said that Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy had joined the leaders' summit discussions by video
link and that NATO had committed to continue supporting Ukraine in the
war.¶ "President Zelenskyy made clear that Ukraine relies on our
continued support," Stoltenberg said. "And our message to him was
equally clear. Ukraine can count on us --- for as long as it takes."¶
That language echoed a summit declaration issued on Tuesday by the G7
industrialized democracies at their own leaders' summit in Elmau,
Germany. (All of the G7 countries, except Japan, are NATO members.)¶
Stoltenberg said NATO would take new steps to help modernize Ukraine's
military, but it was far from clear that the assistance would be
sufficient or arrive quickly enough to tilt the war in Kyiv's favor.¶
"Allies will continue to provide major military and financial help,"
Stoltenberg said. "And today, leaders agreed to strengthen our support
by agreeing a 'Comprehensive Assistance Package' for Ukraine. This
includes secure communications, fuel, medical supplies and body armor.

hundreds of portable anti-drone systems."¶ In the previous Strategic
Concept, adopted in 2010, the allies called Russia a "strategic
partner," and they did not reference China at all. In the new edition,
they described China as a challenge to allies' "interests, security and
values."¶ And [they did not mince words about the peril they see in
Putin's military aggression]{.underline}.¶ [Russia]{.underline}, they
wrote, "[seeks to establish spheres of influence and direct control
through]{.underline} coercion, subversion, [aggression]{.underline} and
annexation."¶ [The document cites Moscow's use of both traditional and

to destabilize countries to our East and South," it adds. "In the High

Alliance."¶ At the same time, the allies claimed they did not want to be
in such a hostile relationship.¶ "NATO does not seek confrontation and
poses no threat to the Russian Federation," the leaders wrote. "We will
continue to respond to Russian threats and hostile actions in a united

### Limited Strategy Now

#### NATO using a limited strategic approach- current discussions are centered around Russia and conventional deterrence.

[NATO's Strategic Concept is meant to provide a diagnosis of a dynamic
international security environment, identify the main
threats]{.underline} and challenges [to Euro-Atlantic security, and
outline ways to address such challenges]{.underline}. It is meant,
therefore, to inform NATO policies for years to come. Throughout the
Cold War, NATO Strategic Concepts -- which remained classified -- lasted
roughly a decade on average. When adopted, [the Madrid strategic Concept
will be NATO's fourth]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War.
[Initial discussions on the next Strategic Concept revolved around the
need to prepare the Alliance for]{.underline} a world characterised by
[the return of inter-state threats and great power
competition]{.underline}. This alone marked a sharp contrast with the
Alliance's post-Cold War focus on transnational challenges and non-peer
competitors. What would the return of great power competition entail for
the evolving balance between NATO's so-called three core tasks (i.e.
collective defense, crisis management and cooperative security)? How
should NATO balance a renewed focus on inter-state threats and great
power competitors with the ongoing relevance of transnational threats
and challenges, like terrorism or the climate-security nexus? When
thinking about great power competition, [how much emphasis should NATO
put on Russia's immediate threat to Europe,]{.underline} as opposed to
the more systemic challenge represented by China's strategic
rise[?]{.underline} And what should be the right balance between the
military and non-military aspects of great power competition?
[The]{.underline} latter [question becomes particularly relevant in
light of]{.underline} the growing salience of ["hybrid" forms of warfare
and emerging disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies, [which compel the
Alliance to emphasise societal resilience at home and step up its
efforts to innovate tech]{.underline}nologically. [The war in Ukraine --
and ongoing debates about how the Alliance can assist Ukraine while
strengthening deterrence in Eastern **Europe -- have become important
topics in Strategic Concept discussions**.]{.underline} In a way, the
current war vindicates the view that we do indeed live in an
increasingly competitive world, and that inter-state threats are back.
On the other hand, the overt and direct nature of Russia's invasion
challenges some of the pervading assumptions about how future conflict
was likely to unfold in indirect and hybrid ways. [Even though the
Strategic Concept is meant to inform long-term strategy, the salience of
the war in Ukraine and the fact that it is likely to reverberate for
years to come, makes the crisis important when developing the
Concept.]{.underline}

### NATO Unity Now- Russia Focus

#### NATO maintaining a unified front to deter Russia now

**Picheta 6/29/22** (Rob Picheta; digital news producer at CNN; 6/29/22;
**"**Sweden and Finland are on the cusp of joining NATO. Here\'s why
that matters, and what comes next"; CNN;
https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/29/europe/nato-sweden-finland-summit-explainer-intl/index.html)//akg

(CNN) [**Sweden and Finland** are set formally to end decades of
neutrality and **join** the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization]{.underline} **[(NATO),]{.underline}** in a [historic
breakthrough for the alliance]{.underline} that deals **[a blow to
Russia]{.underline}**n President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline}. The last
major hurdle to the two nations\' entry to the bloc was removed when
[**Turkey dropped its opposition** on Tuesday]{.underline}. That
breakthrough came during a NATO summit in Madrid that has already become
one of the most consequential meetings in the history of the military
alliance. The two countries are now expected to become full NATO members
quickly, shoring up the bloc\'s eastern flank within months of Russia\'s
invasion of Ukraine. Here\'s all you need to know about why the move
happened, what comes next and why it matters. What are the latest
developments? Sweden and Finland both announced their intention to join
NATO in May, after Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine caused a sudden shift
in attitudes toward joining the bloc. That [announcement was **welcomed
by almost all of NATO\'s leaders** \-- but there was one significant
obstacle. **Turkey\'s**]{.underline} President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan,
said he was not looking at both countries joining NATO \"positively[,\"
**accusing them of housing Kurdish \"terrorist
organizations.\"**]{.underline} Under NATO rules, just one member state
can veto a new applicant\'s membership. However, a big diplomatic
breakthrough between the three countries took place at the NATO summit
in Madrid on Tuesday. Turkey signed a trilateral memorandum with Finland
and Sweden, lifting its opposition and officially welcoming them to join
the bloc. \"In NATO, we have always shown that whatever our differences,
we can always sit down, find common ground and resolve any issues.
NATO\'s open door policy has been an historic success,\" NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg told journalists in Madrid. On Wednesday, [NATO
formally invited Sweden and Finland to join, kickstarting a multistage
process that will end with both countries holding full
membership.]{.underline} Ukraine&#39;s President Volodymyr Zelensky on
Wednesday addressed the Madrid NATO summit, where a key diplomatic
breakthrough has paved the way for Sweden and Finland to join. What
happens next? Stoltenberg said Wednesday that he expects [Sweden and
Finland to become members of the military alliance quickly]{.underline}.
The invitation sparks a seven-step accession process. Key moments along
that path include talks between NATO and the candidate countries. The
candidates must formally accept the obligations of membership, and then
current member states sign an Accession Protocol, before individually
ratifying it back home. \"We need a ratification process in 30
parliaments \-- that always takes some time but I expect also that to go
rather quickly because allies are ready to try to make that ratification
process happen as quickly as possible,\" Stoltenberg explained
Wednesday. After that, the candidate country is formally invited to
accede to the Washington Treaty, the founding document of the alliance.
NATO has an \"open door\" policy \-- any country can be invited to join
if it expresses an interest, as long as it is able and willing to uphold
the principles of the bloc\'s founding treaty. The ratification process
usually takes about a year, from the signing of the Accession Protocol
by existing members to the country joining the Washington Treaty. But
the [war in **Ukraine** has added unprecedented **urgency to Sweden and
Finland\'s membership**]{.underline}, and the [timeline could be
accelerated]{.underline} accordingly. How have leaders reacted? [**US**
President Joe Biden]{.underline} praised the breakthrough with Turkey,
[saying it sent a **clear signal to Russia that NATO was
united**]{.underline} and growing. Sweden and Finland\'s \"[decision to
**move away from neutrality** and the tradition of neutrality **to join
the NATO alliance** is going to make us **stronger** and **more secure**
and NATO stronger]{.underline},\" Biden said. \"We are sending an
unmistakable message in my view\... that NATO is strong, united, and the
steps we are taking during this summit are going to further augment our
collective strength.\" Inside Biden\'s successful six-month bid to
expand NATO Biden said the two Nordic countries\' accession was a sign
Putin\'s aims had backfired. \"Putin was looking for the Finlandization
of Europe,\" he said, referring to the so-called Finlandization dynamic
that saw Russia dominant over the foreign policy of its smaller neighbor
for decades. \"He\'s going to get the NATOization of Europe, and that is
exactly what he did not want, that\'s exactly what needs to be done to
guarantee security for Europe. And I think it\'s necessary,\" Biden
said. The move was met with delight across the countries that make up
NATO\'s eastern front, many of which have expressed concern that they
could be next in Russia\'s crosshairs if it is successful in Ukraine.
Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said the step was \"significant,\"
and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda called it \"wonderful news.\"

#### A unified military response to Ukraine proves cohesion and sets the groundwork for a NATO pivot in Europe.

// ZX

[Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February, the North
Atlantic Alliance has proven its capabilities to mobilize for collective
defense and ably support the Ukrainians fighting for their
country,]{.underline} the top [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) military
leaders said today. Dutch Adm. Rob Bauer, the chairman of the
alliance\'s military committee, emphasized the alliance faces a new
situation. \"The focus of this meeting was on collective defense,\" he
said following a meeting of NATO military leaders. \"[Without a doubt, a
new era for NATO has begun. In the past few months, NATO has shown that
it is capable \[of swiftly and effectively changing\] its posture. We
have implemented the largest reinforcement of collective defense in a
generation.\"]{.underline} The 30-nation Atlantic alliance capitalized
on work begun after Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014 to speedily
reinforce vulnerable frontline states. All this is part of the new NATO
military strategy, which --- Bauer said --- is evolving even as Russia
poured over Ukraine\'s border on February 24. [Russian President
Vladimir Putin\'s war in Ukraine \"has presented us with a new strategic
reality,\" Bauer said. A reality the NATO nations can face down. At the
meeting, Bauer said the allied chiefs of defense heard from their
Ukrainian counterpart. \"We commended Ukraine for the willingness across
all generations to fight for freedom]{.underline},\" Bauer said.
\"Ukraine will never accept Russian occupation, and **[NATO will support
Ukraine for as long as necessary]{.underline}**.\" The chiefs also
discussed what Putin\'s war means to the alliance both in the short term
and long. \"I want to stress that we are not looking at the situation in
Ukraine alone,\" Bauer said. \"Together with Finland and Sweden, and our
Asia-Pacific partners --- Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic
of South Korea --- the chiefs of defense discussed how we can best
assess all global defensive alliances. It is very much our adversary who
determines the timeline. And that means we always have to be ready to
expect the unexpected.\" Ukraine has fought the Russian military to a
standstill, and in fact, driven it away from the capital of Kyiv. The
Ukrainians are pushing back the Russians in the Donbas region. Bauer
ascribes the success --- in part --- to the difference in morale of the
force. \"There are many lessons to be learned from the war in Ukraine,\"
he said. \"Most importantly, it has once again proven the importance of
morale, to know what you are fighting for. The 3.2 million men and women
in uniform who serve this alliance know exactly what they are fighting
for: [The protection of freedom and democracy; the protection of our way
of life.\"]{.underline} Air Force Gen. Tod D. Wolters, commander of
European Command and the NATO supreme allied commander Europe, also
discussed Ukraine at the news conference. He noted that the allies have
supplied the Ukrainian military with weapon systems that have been
effective against the overwhelming size of the Russian force. \"[All of
this is making a difference, helping Ukraine defend its people, its
territory and it\'s free and democratic future,\" he said. The United
States helps lead these efforts \"with speed and agility.\"]{.underline}
He noted that the United States has provided more than \$4 billion in
lethal assistance since the invasion. \"For the last 84 days, our focus
is to support so that Ukraine can prevail,\" Wolters said. \"With
respect to the defense of the alliance, we\'ve responded in all domains,
in all regions, to shield all allies. We\'ve deployed elements of the
NATO Response Force to strengthen our forward defense.\" There are now
eight battle groups under NATO command deployed along the eastern flank.
There are now over 42,000 troops and 120 jets on high alert, with more
than 20 ships ready to respond, he said. \"Our land domain has seen a
10-fold increase, the air domain a 50 percent increase of fighters
patrolling the skies.\" The United States now has more than 100,000
service members in Europe to ensure deterrence works, and the alliance
has re-started training Ukrainian service members. \"**[The bottom line:
NATO resolve and unity is as great as it\'s ever been,\"]{.underline}**
Wolters said. \"The performance of our Ukrainian partners facing this
aggression has been very, very impressive.\" While NATO has changed to
confront Russia, the alliance must continue the transformation of the
armed forces and military capabilities to meet the new strategic
realities, said French Air and Space Gen. Philippe Lavigne, the supreme
allied commander transformation. \"Transformation is not only
technology, it is innovation, it is a mindset change, it is people and
their new skills,\" he said. \"The Russian aggression in Ukraine, and
the consequences that war produced for the security of the Euro-Atlantic
area is an additional trigger to accelerate the path of
transformation.\" Lavigne said the military leaders are convinced the
alliance must continue to build capacity to engage and be able to
operate in multi-domain operations: Land, sea, air, space and cyber.
\"[This is both a strategic challenge and an opportunity,\" he said.
\"It is a challenge, because we have to develop the ability to deal and
synchronize with multiple actors, military, governmental, civilian and
industry. And it\'s also an opportunity because **we will be stronger
together.\"**]{.underline}

"There is only one thing worse than fighting with allies," British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill once said, "and that is fighting without
them." Even when their value is clear, [alliances are hard to establish
and even harder to maintain]{.underline}. The glue of any coalition is
trust among its members, and [trust]{.underline} can't be surged in a
crisis---it [must be built up over time]{.underline}. For over 70 years,
NATO's members have built up trust; in spite of much political bickering
and animosity, Washington's NATO allies have trusted the United States
and respected its leadership. Yet [in the years **before the Russian
invasion** of Ukraine, this hard-won **trust had begun to
erode**.]{.underline} At the height of the Cold War, the U.S. military
presence in Europe was around a half million troops. Today, [the Ukraine
crisis has temporarily pushed the U.S. military presence in Europe to
100,000 troops, but fewer than 40,000 soldiers are permanently stationed
on the continent]{.underline}. [Trump's threats]{.underline} to withdraw
from NATO and his administration's effort to close military bases and
reduce the U.S. presence in Europe were never fully executed, but the
message it sent to U.S. allies [was damning]{.underline}. More recently,
the United States' withdrawal from [Afghanistan left NATO allies in the
lurch]{.underline}, struggling to justify their involvement with the
United States over the past 20 years after being caught off guard by the
speed and timing of the pullout. [**Russia's invasion of Ukraine** has
[**steeled**](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2022-04-06/cold-war-never-ended-russia-ukraine-war)
the Western military alliance and reinforced the importance of
**NATO.**]{.underline} [**But** despite the unity now on display,
**those ties could fray** in the months and years ahead.]{.underline}
[Germany's pledge to dramatically increase defense expenditure marks a
fundamental turning point in European security]{.underline}, setting
Berlin on the path toward becoming the world's third-largest military
spender, behind the United States and China. [The EU]{.underline},
meanwhile, [has taken tentative steps toward greater defense
cooperation]{.underline}, with the creation of a rapid reaction force as
part of its Strategic Compass concept. And Macron has used the Ukraine
crisis [to reiterate calls for "strategic
autonomy]{.underline}," [declaring, "We cannot depend on others to

Russian President Vladimir [**Putin's invasion of Ukraine has
reinvigorated** the Western alliance and bolstered transatlantic
solidarity]{.underline}. After being declared "brain dead" by French
President Emmanuel Macron in 2019, [**NATO** has sprung to
life]{.underline}, deploying forces to its eastern flank and
coordinating the provision of sophisticated weapons that have helped
Ukraine impede Russia's invasion. For the first time in its history, the
European Union has financed the purchase and delivery of lethal aid.
Western countries have vastly exceeded expectations in implementing
coordinated financial sanctions that have crippled Russia's economy.
Even neutral Switzerland joined the fray. [But no matter how remarkable
**this solidarity** may be in the short term, there is **no guarantee**
that **it will last**:]{.underline} if policymakers are complacent,
powerful trends predating the Ukraine crisis could overwhelm and
ultimately derail it. [Protectionist sentiment and self-defeating trade
wars have pulled at the seams]{.underline} of Western economic
integration. Former U.S. President Donald [Trump's threats]{.underline}
to pull out of NATO [and the]{.underline} chaotic [withdrawal from
Afghanistan]{.underline} in 2021 [have chipped away at military
trust]{.underline} between the United States and Europe. A Marine Le Pen
victory later this month in France would pose additional challenges to
the alliance, and looming concerns about the 2024 presidential election
raise doubts about the United States' commitment. [**If not managed
intelligently,** **the reawakening of Europe** as a diplomatic and
military actor and the reexamination of global economic interdependence
**catalyzed by Russia's invasion** **could result** not **in** a
strengthened transatlantic alliance but in a more worrying outcome: the
**emergence of three** distinct **blocs,** one centered around the
United States, a second around Europe, and a third around China (which
would include Russia).]{.underline} [Such a world]{.underline}---with
the United States and Europe often collaborating, but also at odds when
their interests diverge---[**would make** the **management of China and
Russia** more **difficult**]{.underline}, as [the two would have
opportunities to trigger and exploit U.S.-European
tensions]{.underline}. [It would also represent **a major missed
opportunity for** the **U**nited **S**tates **and Europe.**]{.underline}

### At: EDT Now- Aff Uq Links

#### Status quo commitments to increased focus on EDT is all rhetoric- the Aff's substantive focus on China and insistence that the US determine the direction on NATO innovation lead to alliance divisions over burden-sharing and European autonomy

[One secret to]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
([NATO]{.underline}) [longevity has been its ability to continually
adapt to the ever-changing external security environment and needs of
its members]{.underline}. This is all the more needed today in a world
that is at once more complex and more interconnected. Over the next
decade, [NATO's ability to adapt]{.underline} and remain relevant for
the future [will depend on]{.underline} both **[external and internal
drivers of cohesion and division]{.underline}**. External drivers
include the threats and opportunities facing the alliance and its
individual members, the availability of other competent security and
defense partners, and the degree of countervailing influence by
competitors. [Internal drivers for NATO include shared]{.underline}
identity and [values]{.underline}, political cohesion around shared
interests, the presence or absence of U.S. leadership, **[the degree of
responsibility sharing in NATO]{.underline}**; [and]{.underline} the
orientation and [cohesiveness of national governments]{.underline}.
Taken together, [these factors create centrifugal and centripetal forces
that can alternately drive NATO member countries together or pull them
apart]{.underline}.¶ Trajectory 1 (Baseline): Muddling Through¶
OVERVIEW¶ NATO endures and remains relevant in many areas, but it fails
to make the investments and reforms needed to make it fit for purpose in
the future. Most crucially, [allies agree to enhance NATO's collective
defense capabilities to include integrating multidomain tools into
its]{.underline} deterrence and defense [posture]{.underline}. [Crisis
management and cooperative security remain its core tasks, but it fails
to secure the political suppo]{.underline}rt and resources needed [to
execute them effectively]{.underline}, and they increasingly take place
through coalitions of the willing or under EU and UN auspices. [Allies
increase political coordination at NATO on issues ranging from China to
emerging and disruptive technologies]{.underline}, **[but this results
in little more than a "talk shop" that produces statements lamenting the
state of the world and condemning adversaries' actions]{.underline}**.
**[The United States and European allies become increasingly frustrated
with one another]{.underline}**---**[the United States with allies'
failure to assume more responsibility]{.underline}** in and around
Europe or to contribute more decisively to managing China, **[and allies
with the United States' seemingly myopic focus on China and
unwillingness]{.underline}** (despite statements to the contrary) **[to
allow Europeans autonomy in their own affairs]{.underline}**. **[Efforts
to increase investment in innovation falter as allies pursue projects
that benefit their own defense industrial bases but do not necessarily
enhance NATO's]{.underline}** **[defense]{.underline}** and security.
[Still others fail to invest in innovation at all, widening the

[NATO's AI strategy **raises many concerns**]{.underline} related to the
AI-driven autonomous weapon systems, as it does not adequately address
the development of such systems, its deployment and governance. The AI
strategy mostly talks about the ethical and responsible use of AI and
has omitted the challenges related to the use of lethal autonomous
weapon systems. For the US, its priorities lie in ensuring responsible
use of AI-enabled systems with their allies for operational and data
sharing. [It remains to be seen if **all the 30 NATO states** **agree**
on the same rules and would be willing to agree on practical guidelines
for the operational use of AI-enabled systems. Another challenge for
NATO is to standardise rules for all member states in dealing with
AI-enabled autonomous weapon systems.]{.underline} Countries like Turkey
are working on autonomous weapons and have developed AI-enabled
loitering munitions. Turkey has requested the US for upgraded F-16
fighter jets that are said to be AI-enabled.25 The Biden Administration
has asked the Congress to approve the upgrade of Turkey's F-16 fighter
jet fleet.26 Turkey's armed drones have also been used in the Ukraine
conflict. For smooth functioning of such systems, it will be necessary
for all NATO members to have standardised rules when it comes to
deployment of such systems. Also, [**there is no transparent allocation
of roles** for different NATO bodies]{.underline}, and ["**no dedicated
line of funding**" for]{.underline} its [AI]{.underline} strategy.27 The
finances are shared through multiple funding like NATO Innovation Fund
and DIANA which manages funding for various other projects leading to
uncertainty over availability of funds and budget cuts. [This will be a
significant challenge for the effective implementation of the AI
strategy]{.underline}.28 [Some other challenges]{.underline} with the
adoption of AI strategy through innovation include [fragmented national
innovation initiatives, allied technological categorisation]{.underline}
and digitisation [gaps]{.underline}, [speed of adoption]{.underline} and
[spending levels]{.underline} and the underuse of NATO's mechanisms to
undertake collaborative defence innovation.29

#### AI strategy and fosters division in NATO- European and US interests diverge over level of regulation and funding

The problem is that [NATO\'s members are at **very different stages**
when it comes to thinking about **AI in the military
context**]{.underline}. [The U.S.,]{.underline} the world\'s biggest
military spender, [has prioritized the use of AI in the defense
realm]{.underline}. But [in Europe, most]{.underline} countries ---
France and the Netherlands excepting --- [barely mention the
technology's defense and military implications in their national AI
strategies]{.underline}. "It's absolutely no surprise that the U.S. had
a military AI strategy before it has a national AI strategy,\" but the
Europeans \"did it exactly the other way around,\" said Ulrike Franke, a
senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations,
said[: That echoes familiar **transatlantic differences**]{.underline}
--- and previous U.S. President Donald Trump\'s complaints --- [**over
defense spending,** but also highlights]{.underline} the **[different
approaches to AI regulation]{.underline}** more broadly. The [EU\'s AI
strategy takes a cautious line]{.underline}, touting itself as
\"human-centric,\" focused on taming corporate excesses and keeping
citizens\' data safe. [The U.S., which tends to be light on regulation
and keen on defense, sees things differently]{.underline}. [There are
also **divergences over what technologies the alliance ought to
develop,**]{.underline} [including lethal autonomous weapons
systems]{.underline} --- often dubbed "killer robots" --- programmed to
identify and destroy targets without human control. [Powerful NATO
members]{.underline} including France, the U.K., and the U.S. have
developed these technologies and [**oppose a treaty** on these
weapons,]{.underline} while [others]{.underline} like Belgium and
Germany [have expressed serious concerns]{.underline} about the
technology. These weapons systems have also faced fierce public
opposition from civil society and human rights groups, including from
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who in 2018 called
for a ban. Geoană said the alliance has "retained autonomous weapon
systems as part of the interests of NATO." The group hopes that its
upcoming recommendations will allow the ethical use of the technology
without "stifling innovation."

More broadly, this chapter illustrates that [regional]{.underline} and
international [organizations have high stakes for military AI
governance]{.underline}. [As]{.underline} development, procurement, and
[implementation of AI is accelerating, it is imperative that
international organizations facilitate cooperation]{.underline} among
states and industry partners to guide responsible military AI
implementation aligned with core values and legal obligations. [The
convening and coordinating power of international
organizations]{.underline}, among other governance tools, [is a
necessary step for]{.underline} state cooperation and [policy
alignment.]{.underline} **[How exactly NATO interacts with other
international organizations in the security architecture]{.underline}**,
including the UN and EU, [is a political topic that will also have
important implications for the composition of international technology
governance]{.underline} regimes, and is a subject for further research.¶
On that note [NATO]{.underline}, or any other international
organization, **[is not exempt from these political
hurdles]{.underline}**. [As EDTs increasingly become a focal
point]{.underline} in the geopolitical space[, any approach of AI
governance]{.underline} in the international security environment
**[will have global political undertones]{.underline}**. **[This will
undoubtedly be a significant hurdle for NATO as it balances responsible
AI development and Allied]{.underline}** coordination and
**[cooperation]{.underline}** in a changing geopolitical landscape. And
certainly, [the political realities may well represent the greatest
challenge and disincentivize NATO to emerge as a leader in responsible
military AI]{.underline}. Nevertheless, the three pillars indicate that
NATO is an institution with considerable opportunity to shape
responsible AI governance. More specifically, this entails urging and
facilitating Allied standards and policies to establish foundations for
emerging military technology built on informed and ethical principles
and enhance the international security environment.

### Cyber Policy

#### Ambiguities in cyberspace lead to drawn-out NATO decisions which result in [disunity]{.underline} and fracture the alliance.

President Joe Biden has issued grave warnings that [Russia might launch
a cyberattack against the United States in retaliation for the punishing
sanctions levied after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline} He's
advised American companies to "accelerate efforts to lock their digital
doors," and many officials expect [an attack against critical U.S.
infrastructure]{.underline} to be inevitable. [One way Biden and other
Western leaders are attempting to deter potential Russian cyber
retaliation]{.underline} during the Ukraine crisis [is]{.underline}
through NATO's [Article 5]{.underline} collective defense pledge ---
that an attack on one is an attack against all. That's because since the
2014 NATO summit in Wales (which, coincidentally, took place following
another Russia-Ukraine crisis), the alliance has affirmed that [Article
5 extends to cyberspace]{.underline}. In other words, a cyberattack
against any NATO member could conceivably represent an attack against
the entire alliance. The pledge is the embodiment of the allies'
security guarantee to each other and the beating heart of NATO. After
Russia invaded Ukraine, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
confirmed that [NATO policy on collective defense and cyberspace holds
strong]{.underline}, noting that NATO has "decided to make clear that a
cyberattack can trigger Article 5." And following an extraordinary
meeting of heads of state and government on March 24[, the alliance
reinforced that it is "ready to impose costs on those who harm us in
cyberspace."]{.underline} But despite this rhetoric, [exactly how and
when Article 5 applies to cyberspace remains unclear.]{.underline} This
[ambiguity is a problem --- with potentially disastrous
consequences]{.underline}. [Staking the credibility]{.underline} [of
Article 5 to]{.underline} what are often [**murky activities in
cyberspace** threatens to **undermine the broader principle of
collective defense**.]{.underline} [We can't risk **fracturing the
transatlantic alliance at a critical juncture** in its history over a
debate **on what constitutes a major or minor
cyberattack**]{.underline}. For that reason, NATO should move quickly to
clarify its policy on cyberattacks and explicitly state the threshold
for what would trigger an Article 5 response. Furthermore, [NATO members
should commit to treating cyberattacks]{.underline} that do not rise to
the level of a major attack [as a national matter --- not one for the
alliance.]{.underline} Such a shift might face some initial resistance,
particularly in light of the Kremlin's history of malicious cyber
activities. One of the first state-initiated cyberattacks was
perpetrated by Russia against Estonia, a NATO member, in 2007. In the
intervening years, Moscow has increased its malicious cyber activities,
such as the SolarWinds breach uncovered in December 2020 in which Russia
gained access to a treasure trove of U.S. data. Russian President
Vladimir Putin's maneuvers against NATO members, along with the
annexation of Crimea in 2014, spurred the alliance to adopt a Cyber
Defense Pledge in 2016 that recognized cyberspace as a military domain.
Two years later, NATO created a Cyberspace Operations Center in Mons,
Belgium to improve situational awareness and coordinate cyber
operations. Since then, the alliance has consistently reaffirmed the
application of Article 5 to cyberspace. At the 2021 summit in Brussels,
NATO committed to a new Comprehensive Cyber Defense Policy, with allies
agreeing to employ the "full range of capabilities" at all times to
"deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats."
Notably, NATO refined its language with last summer's summit communique
to account for the fact that some cyber incidents may not be
individually decisive, but nevertheless significant when viewed in the
aggregate. Specifically, the allies recognized "the impact of
significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain
circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack." In
practice, however, NATO leaders have avoided clarifying the conditions
under which a cyberattack would trigger Article 5 and how NATO would
respond. When pressed about Russian cyberattacks in the Ukraine context,
Stoltenberg cautioned that, "we have never gone into the position where
we give a potential adversary the privilege of defining exactly when we
trigger Article 5." This equivocation is not surprising, for several
reasons. The nature of cyberspace often confounds unequivocal deterrence
declarations. States tend to operate in cyberspace with plausible
deniability, which can make it difficult to rapidly ascertain
responsibility for cyber incidents. Also, it can be challenging to
understand the intent behind observed cyber behavior, and there is often
a substantial time lag between when an initial penetration of a network
occurs and when the target even realizes the breach. And the vast
majority of cyber operations cause virtual, not physical, damage,
complicating efforts to assess and evaluate the implications of the
costs inflicted. Moreover, it can take time to develop and identify a
way to infiltrate a network as well as the computer code that takes
advantage of a vulnerability for malicious ends. This means states may
lack a palatable cyber response option for retaliatory purposes at the
desired time. This creates a slew of practical problems if Article 5
were to be invoked for a cyberattack. From an implementation
perspective, it would trigger deliberations within the North Atlantic
Council, NATO's primary decision-making body. [Decisions made within the
NAC **require unanimity**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} can be
difficult to achieve for many issues [but is especially burdensome for
cyber ones]{.underline}, given all of the ambiguities outlined above.
[The most likely outcome of this process would be **a long, drawn-out
deliberation** resulting in **a divided alliance** unable to agree on
how or whether to respond.]{.underline} Quite simply, some allies are
unlikely to want to risk World War III for a cyberattack that disrupts
the financial infrastructure, for instance, of another country but
doesn't lead to loss of life or sustained damage. [These challenges have
major strategic implications for NATO]{.underline}. After years of
publicly and repeatedly linking Article 5 to cyberspace and reinforcing
that policy in response to the Ukraine conflict, [a **failure to achieve
consensus**]{.underline} and respond to a Russian cyberattack against a
NATO member [could imperil Article 5 in other areas.]{.underline} The
[**disunity** that is likely to be revealed during NAC deliberations
would]{.underline} then [**undermine** the broader **political
cohesion** that has]{.underline}, for the most part, [been remarkably
strong throughout the war in Ukraine]{.underline}. [This would make it
more difficult for the alliance to respond to other forms of Russian
behavior]{.underline}. As Biden emphasized at a press conference last
month, "the single-most important thing is for us to stay unified ... We
have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly unified." [NATO has achieved
some strategic ambiguity with its current cyber policy, which may help
to deter high-stakes Russian assaults during the present
crisis.]{.underline} However, rather than an all-out Russian
cyberattack, a far more plausible scenario is a lower-level attack
carried out by the Russian government or a proxy group against one or
more allies. In this case, the alliance's interests --- not to mention
transatlantic security --- would be better served by adopting
nationally-tailored responses rather than pulling the Article 5 lever.
Additionally, to prevent further escalation and reinforce the implicit
firebreak that currently exists between cyber and conventional military
operations, NATO allies should also agree to restrict any retaliatory
response against Moscow to the cyber realm or non-military instruments
of power.

#### Even cooperation agreements on cybersecurity can cause division- countries will disagree on how to interpret the plan

In May 2008, [the U.S. Department of Defense and the German Ministry of
Defence signed a]{.underline} [memorandum]{.underline} of understanding
[concerning "Cooperation on]{.underline} Information Assurance and
Computer [Network Defense]{.underline}." Computer network defense (CND)
refers to actions taken on computer networks to monitor and protect
those networks. [It is not the only memorandum the U.S. Department of
Defense has signed with allies on cyber defense.]{.underline}¶ [In late
2016, U.S. Cyber Command operators wiped Islamic State propaganda
material off a server located in Germany. The German
government]{.underline} [was]{.underline} notified in some fashion but
**[not asked for advance consent, causing much
frustration.]{.underline}** While U.S. Cyber Command's reported action
may have violated Germany's sovereignty, it didn't explicitly violate
the memorandum. It wasn't an act of CND; it was a computer network
attack (CNA), seeking to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy.¶ [This
reveals an **uneasy situation within cyber cooperation**]{.underline}:
**[Allies do not agree on the appropriate procedures and boundaries for
offensive cyber operations]{.underline}**. More specifically, [there is
no agreement on when military cyber organizations can gain access to
systems and networks in allied territory to disrupt adversarial
activity.]{.underline} As I have argued previously**[, this issue may
end up causing significant loss in allies' trust and
confidence]{.underline}**. My proposed solution: NATO allies should
establish memoranda of understanding on offensive cyber effects
operations in systems or networks based in allied territory.

### Expanding Strategy

#### Expanding NATO security strategy risks undermining the alliance's core defense of conventional deterrence

From crisis management back to collective defence International security
institutions have often been faced with the difficulty of calibrating
their own sphere of operation so that they respond to the concerns of
their member states and meet the intent of their original mandate. This
is what congruence is about. It draws on the comparative advantages of
the organisation under consideration, analysed against the evolution of
the security environment and member states' policies. One aspect of this
debate relates to how an institution and its member states define the
scope of activities to be covered; how specialised versus how
broad-ranging an institution's mandate must be (See Koremenos et al.
2001, Guzman 2013). This, in turn, feeds into the adaptation process, as
a particular balance of activities may need to be changed to respond to
new needs. [With the end of the Cold War NATO has been faced with this
debate in different ways: with the embrace of crisis management in the
early 1990s at a time when collective defence was no longer central (See
Rupp 2000, Galen Carpenter 2001); with the counter-terrorism turn
post-911; and more recently with the move back to collective defence in
the aftermath of the Ukraine crisis]{.underline} in 2014. Back in the
early 1990s, NATO's purpose was deeply challenged, most notably due to
the fading away of its collective defence core task, and the mismatch
that it implied between the Alliance's character as a defence actor and
the nature of the security needs. NATO needed to adapt. This debate,
both in academic and policy circles, raised existential questions about
NATO's nature and purpose (see McCalla 1996, Wallander 2000, Menon and
Welsh 2011). This was inter alia encapsulated by the "out of area or out
of business" formula, by US Senator Richard Lugar (1993), which implied
that crisis management operations con- ducted outside of the North
Atlantic area were a response to the risk of irrelevance pro- voked by
the absence of an existential threat. Crisis management was undoubtedly
important; as a matter of fact, crisis management operations in the
1990s and 2000s were by far the most visible NATO activity (Frantzen
2005, Edström and Gyllensporre 2012). Yet these operations were also
challenges to NATO's core defence function. [Among the key questions
raised was that of the need for NATO to adapt to a constantly evolving
security environment, **yet raising the risk that embracing an increas-
ingly broader security mandate would undermine NATO's core defence
character**]{.underline}. The "winning the peace" agenda would not
substitute or even complement the war-fighting core role without
(negative) consequences for the latter (Yost 1998, Nelson 2006). In a
post-911 context, the role of NATO in counter-terrorism (CT) raised
similar ques- tions. NATO had to adapt to the new environment, and thus
respond to the terrorist threat (for which its Article 5 had been
invoked for the first time), yet the comparative advantage of the
Alliance in CT was not obvious to everyone, both for political and oper-
ational reasons (Valasek 2001/2002). These two examples of crisis
management and counter-terrorism show how an adap- tation process can
generate side-effects that in the end may increase the vulnerability of
the institution, through maladaptation. In this context, [2014 has been
a key moment in NATO's congruence quest (Webber et al. 2014). The 2014
Ukraine crisis and with it the annexation of Crimea by Russia have
signifi- cantly changed the European security landscape and, for
European security actors, their own perception of threats. While Russia
was beforehand seen as a partner by most Euro- pean states (NATO 2012,
para. 36),1 the Ukraine crisis brought it back to the category of
threats]{.underline}. [The New Cold War had begun]{.underline} (Lucas
2008, Trenin 2014, Kroenig 2015). **[For NATO, this meant a return to
the so-called deterrence and defence agenda,2 and to the core task of
collective defence]{.underline}**, as defined in the 2010 Strategic
Concept (NATO 2010). A few months after the annexation of Crimea, NATO
member states meet at the Wales Summit, and state that "Russia's
aggressive actions against Ukraine have fundamentally challenged our
vision of a Europe whole, free, and at peace" (NATO 2014, para. 1), and
that "the greatest responsibility of the Alliance is to protect and
defend our territories and our populations against attack, as set out in
Article 5 of the Washington Treaty" (NATO 2014, para. [2). **Since then
most of NATO's attention has been towards the menace of a resurgent
Russia**]{.underline}, be it in terms of narrative (or securitisation
process) and policy-making, capability development, military posture or
exercises (see Ringsmose and Rynning 2017), leading NATO's Secretary
General to talk about "the largest reinforcement of our collective
defence" since the end of the Cold War (NATO Secretary General 2018).
Decisions taken include (Turner 2019): the strengthening of NATO's rapid
reaction forces, with the trebling of the size of the NATO Response
Force, and the creation of a "spearhead force" within it, known as the
Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF); the deployment of
multinational battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland,
known as the enhanced Forward Presence (eFP); the increasing of the
exercise programme, with a new stress on collective defence exercises;
the adoption of the NATO Readiness Initiative that aims at increasing
the readiness of NATO forces with an additional 30 manoeuvre battalions,
30 major naval combatants and 30 kinetic air squadrons, with enabling
forces, at 30 days' readiness; and the building of resilience, including
defence against cyber-attacks and other forms of "hybrid" attacks.

#### Broadening NATO's strategic mission trades off with resources need for contemporary warfighting---the plan leads to infighting and undermines deterrence.

Enlarging the scope: towards security and internal threats [Acquiring a
mandate or a capacity to tackle a broad range of threats implies that
NATO moves in two directions: towards more security-type activities as
opposed to defence- focused ones; and towards more internal
issues.]{.underline} In both directions, a more assertive role for NATO
implies three levels of activity: policy development, i.e. the ability
to produce policy documents that frame NATO's role in a particular
domain; capability devel- opment, i.e. the ability to acquire expertise
or resources that can be used for the implementation of a particular
policy; and operations, i.e. the ability to act through oper- ational
activities, be they exercises, training or actual use of NATO and member
states' capabilities placed under NATO command. These three levels allow
us to distinguish between domains where NATO would only act in a
coordination or information-sharing role (for which capability
development and operations are not necessary), and domains where NATO
would be having a more central function[. Applied to the current
landscape, the broadening security agenda beyond what is already done
would imply a more assertive role for NATO in defensive/offensive cyber
activities]{.underline} (with the cyberspace being an operational domain
and covered by Article [5), in the fight against organised crime
networks, inter alia through maritime security, as well as in the broad
security sector reform]{.underline} (SSR) agenda of partner countries,
to take just a few examples. In all these tasks coercion and military
effect are not absent, yet they are less central than in traditional
defence activities. The second direction of the move -- [inward-looking
-- would mean that NATO plays an increased role in the defence against
internal threats, by contributing to: critical infrastructure protection
and resilience building;]{.underline} civilian protection tasks;
police-type activities such as anti-terrorist operations in European
capitals; operations that aim to tackle the security consequences of
(massive) migrant flows; or support to police forces facing under-the-
radar hybrid-type non-conventional attacks. This would imply
establishing relations with a set of national actors, from law
enforcement entities to municipalities, public companies (in the energy
and transport sectors among others) and the private sector (Machi 2017).
[The role of NATO in these various activities could vary in ambition,
spanning information- sharing, awareness rising, coordination,
exercises, and more operational tasks]{.underline}. The implied risks of
task expansion [**Although these various tasks make sense when assessed
against the broad security** needs of NATO]{.underline} member states
and societies, and may be justified for political reasons, **[they carry
a number of risks of maladaptation]{.underline}**. First, [NATO would
have to]{.underline} further develop or [acquire an
expertise]{.underline} on issues [that can be very technical, or human
resources-heavy, and for which **even the member states may have a
deficit**]{.underline} (as in the cyber domain, energy security, or
critical infrastructure protection). The added-value of NATO's role
would be all the more challenged as its expertise is being ques- tioned.
[Second, the legitimacy of NATO's role in some areas may be challenged
due to a lack of expertise or because of the possible intrusiveness of
NATO's activities;]{.underline} this leads to sover- eignty
considerations, with states -- be they NATO member states or not --
having issues with any attempt from NATO to interfere with their
internal sphere, in the law enforcement domain for example.
**[Third]{.underline}**, **[any task expansion would require a degree of
consensus within member states on the merits of the enlarged mandate,
and this will prove to be difficult, as illustrated by the sensitivities
of broadening NATO's agenda towards the South, to include
counter-terrorism and migration policies for example
(]{.underline}**NATO official 2019). [Even an agreement on broadening
NATO's mandate on the Eastern flank to embrace security issues would be
difficult]{.underline}. Securitisation is inherently subjective (Buzan
and Waever 2003, Sperling and Webber 2016); it is the outcome of a
political choice that in turn results from an intersub- jective
understanding of what constitutes a threat. It follows that
consensus-building on newly identified threats or policies is all the
more difficult[. Fourth, the broad security field is already crowded
with institutions that in some areas would appear in a stronger
position. NATO's positioning on the broad field of activities would
potentially duplicate existing capacities, and place it in direct
competition with others, often in a weaker position.]{.underline} From
the SSR domain in Sub-Saharan Africa to police or border tasks within
European states, actors like the EU, national administrations, police
forces and NGOs would not necessarily welcome a NATO role. Fifth**[, any
broadening of NATO's mandate would be resisted as it would carry the
risk of diluting NATO's war-fighting capability. Contemporary
war-fighting is arguably politically, financially and operationally
demanding; any parallel effort can, there- fore, be seen as a
deleterious diversion]{.underline}** (see Stapleton 2016). [Cyber
security provides a good example of these risks. Cyber is arguably a key
dimen- sion of NATO's mission]{.underline}. It is part of "NATO's core
task of collective defence", and its qua- lification as an operational
domain implies that NATO "must be able to operate as effectively in
cyberspace as \[it does\] in the air, on land, and at sea to strengthen
and support the Alliance's overall deterrence and defence posture" (NATO
2018, para. 20) At the 2014 Wales Summit, Allies have also stated that a
cyber attack could lead to the invo- cation of Article 5 of the
Washington Treaty. Furthermore, NATO has developed a fair amount of
doctrinal and policy documents in that domain. [Yet the extent to which
NATO can play an important role in cyber security is uncertain for
reasons that have to do with expertise, capabilities, the nature of the
threat and of its possible targets, and therefore the nature of the
response]{.underline}.

#### Expanding NATO capacity creates divisions in the alliance over how to balance increased capacity with a focus on Russia

NATO's Next Strategic Concept: Prioritise or Perish; Survival, 63:5,
147-168, DOI: 10.1080/00396338.2021.1982203

The problem, rather, was that [NATO's new course of action was so
hard]{.underline}¶ [fought politically that a revision of the Strategic
Concept was always out of]{.underline}¶ [the question]{.underline}. The
most exposed [eastern allies]{.underline} vocally [demanded a
'defence]{.underline}¶ [first' policy whereby NATO would build up
significant defence measures]{.underline}¶ and only then open a dialogue
with Russia. [Other allies, including Germany]{.underline},¶ [sought a
more balanced 'dual-track' approach that would leave the
door]{.underline}¶ [open to dialogue with Russia]{.underline}. [Still
other allies worried that NATO would]{.underline}¶ [become engulfed by
its 'eastern flank' to the detriment of 'southern flank']{.underline}¶
[crisis management and counter-terrorism]{.underline}, and wished to
balance these¶ geographical concerns. [These debates had taken a
distinct toll on NATO's]{.underline}¶ [political capacity for setting
new priorities]{.underline} when, in January 2017, NATO¶ became
politically consumed by the existential challenge posed by Trump.¶
**[There was thus no political energy for upgrading the
conceptual]{.underline}**¶ **[basis for NATO's new-found defence and
deterrence posture to the level]{.underline}**¶ **[of a Strategic
Concept]{.underline}**. A secret 'Principles and Key Tenets of Credible¶
Deterrence and Defence' paper written in 2016 had led NATO to do more:¶
to scale up its forward forces, reaction forces, training and exercises,
and¶ more.26 However, the Alliance had remained limited by the
assumption¶ that 'doing more' equalled deterrence. Perhaps this was all
that a¶ politically divided alliance could hope for -- a type of
deterrence based on¶ a unified posture rather than a political--military
strategy. However, the¶ objection raised by military planners was that
deterrence is nothing unless¶ it is anchored in a deeper assessment of
how clear threats play out in¶ geographic terms. In short, to really
deter Russia, NATO needed to assess¶ both its own and Russia's 'centres
of gravity' and align NATO actions to¶ achieve desired military
effects.¶ This concern was pervasive among NATO's International Military
Staff¶ through 2016,27 when, according to our sources, key US actors --
and in particular¶ the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General
Joseph Dunford (who¶ represented the United States on NATO's Military
Committee) -- started to¶ press for changes in NATO's military planning.
The outcome was the 2019¶ military strategy. General Dunford acted in
response not only to the concerns¶ of NATO's International Military
Staff but also to a 2015 US National¶ Military Strategy that defined
allies as critical to the execution of 'globally¶ integrated
operations', an emphasis that then-secretary of defense James¶ Mattis
retained in the United States' 2018 National Military Strategy.28¶ If
General Dunford had felt it necessary to set changes in motion in
2016--17,¶ this impulse was only heightened when British Air Chief
Marshal Stuart¶ Peach, who shared Dunford's ideas, assumed the
chairmanship of NATO's¶ Military Committee in June 2018.¶ The trouble
was that, as energy levels on the military side were increasing,¶ they
were deflating on the political side. Dunford and Peach teamed¶ up
around the same time that NATO heads of state and government were¶
meeting in Brussels under the threat that Trump would withdraw the¶
United States from NATO. It was a 'wild ride', as former US national
security¶ advisor John Bolton put it in his memoir, and one that left
NATO with a¶ growing political--military divide.29¶ Who's in charge?¶
[Multiple allies felt taken by surprise by the advanced nature of the
thinking]{.underline}¶ [that went into NATO's military
strategy.]{.underline} When General Dunford remarked¶ in May 2019 that
NATO now had, for the first time 'in decades', a military¶ strategy that
'clearly articulates the challenges that confront NATO' and¶ 'provides
the framework for the various plans that will be in place if deterrence¶
fails', he highlighted not only the benefits of an enhanced framework¶
for military planning but also, inadvertently, the political
shortcomings of¶ the Alliance's strategic leadership.30 **[Some allies
felt a need to push back.]{.underline}**¶ Tellingly, the United States
and the United Kingdom were not among¶ them. American and British
military authorities had led the charge and¶ considered both the new
military strategy and the derivative theatre-wide¶ DDA as having been
politically approved and ready to go.31 **[Other allies]{.underline}**,¶
however, [continue to have reservations with regard to the
Russia-centric]{.underline}¶ [nature of the strategy]{.underline}, and
attach importance to a subtle distinction whereby¶ they have merely
'noted' the military strategy but explicitly 'approved' the¶ DDA. In
fact, these allies have sought to contain the 2019 military strategy¶
and to control the 2020 DDA-led process. As noted, they have arrested
the¶ overarching threat assessment, pushing for an upgrade of the role
of the¶ southern flank. **[A revised Strategic Concept will have to find
a way to balance]{.underline}**¶ **[between Russia-related collective
defence and]{.underline}** southern counter-terrorism¶ and
**[capacity-building]{.underline}**. For now, the southern flank has won
a stronger¶ foothold in the DDA, which henceforth will contain a
Sequenced Response¶ Plan -- which is comparable to the Russia-centric
Graduated Response Plans¶ -- to address southern contingencies. **[This
is merely a warm-up for a grander]{.underline}**¶ **[political debate,
however.]{.underline}**

#### Expanding NATO's strategic mission hurts cohesion by distracting from conventional deterrence of Russia

**Larsen 5-22** (Henrik Larsen, senior researcher at the Center for
Security Studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich,
"NATO Must Get Resilience Right to Withstand Russia and China," Lawfare,

https://www.lawfareblog.com/nato-must-get-resilience-right-withstand-russia-and-china)-amc

From a European perspective, [Russia's invasion of Ukraine marks a new
reality of increased defense spending that will]{.underline} likely
[redress]{.underline} some of the [military imbalance between the United
States and European NATO allies since the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}. It is positive that [the **U**nited **S**tates **seeks
cooperation on** a wider array of **security issues**,]{.underline} such
as trade and technology, that are core to a resilient and united
transatlantic alliance. [At the same time, it is **continental Europe**,
not North America and the United Kingdom, that risks **emerging as a
weak transatlantic link** under growing Russian and Chinese
influence]{.underline} and, therefore, must make the necessary
adjustment. [The **vagueness of U.S. expectations and** the
**questionable durability of U.S. leadership** seems to **give European
allies** more **leverage** in defining the alliance's strategic outlook
on resilience]{.underline}. Restricting nontrusted technology and
economic investments and fighting foreign subversion are mostly national
decisions, but [the European Union has exclusive powers with regard to
trade and coordinates significant assets in other areas.]{.underline}
The European allies can shape the U.S. push for NATO's functional
expansion by clarifying four areas in which the alliance can add value
to transatlantic resilience.

### OCOs

#### NATO wide cooperation doesn't solve issues over cohesion and division- there will still be different interpretations and priorities among member states

Max **Smeets in 2019**

Zurich, director of the European Cyber Conflict Research Initiative;
NATO Allies Need to Come to Terms With Offensive Cyber Operations;
Lawfare;
https://www.lawfareblog.com/nato-allies-need-come-terms-offensive-cyber-operations

**[But there are constraints on a NATO wide-memorandum]{.underline}**,
too. To start, [not all states are equally willing to share intelligence
information]{.underline}. [A bilateral agreement would make it easier to
tailor the notification equity framework to the specific preferences and
capabilities of both governments]{.underline}.¶ II. Can It Be Used as a
Public Signaling Device?¶ The notification equity framework part of the
memorandum of understanding can remain classified. Governments might not
get it right the first time. As the framework might need tweaking,
immediate public disclosure is risky. But a public version, if crafted
carefully, can also help to set the parameters of what Michael
Fischerkeller and Richard Harknett call "agreed competition." That is,
it can help clarify where adversaries are allowed and not allowed to go
within each other's networks. If we want stability in cyberspace, this
is a mechanism by which to achieve it.¶ III. Should the Memorandum Also
Address Cyber Operations Beyond Allied Networks?¶ A memorandum of
understanding narrow in scope---that is, addressing the allies' conduct
of cyber effect operations taking place only in systems or networks in
allied territory---would ignore the negative impact on allied
intelligence operations and capabilities beyond these systems and
networks.¶ Military cyber organizations are operating in a global
environment historically dominated by intelligence agencies, and the
Five Eyes has always been the most dominant actor in cyberspace. But the
anglophone intelligence alliance is not the only intelligence actor
operating across the world. Recent cases---such as the Dutch 's General
Intelligence and Security Service infiltration into the Russia-based
network of the infamous hacking group Cozy Bear---have illustrated the
continued global prevalence and value of allies' intelligence operations
beyond the Five Eyes alliance.¶ [If military cyber organizations
increasingly take up the role of "disrupter," it may negatively impact
global intelligence collection of allies]{.underline}---[particularly
those countries that favor long-term access over immediate effect. It
will also more likely uncover and burn allied
capabilities]{.underline}.¶ The risks of occurring are higher than one
may think as [intelligence agencies have a tendency and incentive to
target and track the same entities]{.underline}. For example, in late
2014, cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab reported on the Magnet of
Threats. The cybersecurity company discovered a server belonging to a
research organization in the Middle East that simultaneously hosted
implants for at least five Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors:
Regin and the Equation Group (English language), Turla and ItaDuke
(Russian language), Animal Farm (French language) and Careto (Spanish
language). Consider what would have happened if one of those five APT
groups had sought to cause a disruptive effect---rather than collect
intelligence---against the target in the Middle East. It likely would
have resulted in much earlier discovery and analysis by threat
intelligence companies (or other actors) exposing the tactics,
techniques and procedures (TTPs) of each actor group.¶ Also, [even the
anticipation of more cyber effect operations in nonallied networks from
one allied state could lead to a change in operations by another
state]{.underline}. Indeed, states have shown in the past that the
anticipation of early discovery of an operation has led to a change in
their TTPs. For example, the National Security Agency (NSA) created an
"exploit orchestrator" called FoxAcid, an Internet-enabled system
capable of attacking target computers in a variety of different ways,
depending on whether it is discovered---or likely to be discovered---in
a given network. FoxAcid has a modular design, with flexibility allowing
the NSA to swap and replace exploits and run different exploits based on
various considerations. Against technically sophisticated targets where
the chance of detection is high, FoxAcid would normally choose to run
low-value exploits.¶ Not a Silver Bullet¶ While I argue that [the NATO
memorandum of understanding]{.underline} [on offensive cyber
operations]{.underline} in systems or networks based in allied territory
can greatly help in promoting stability and enhancing confidence among
allies, it [is not a silver bullet]{.underline}. [It can only reduce
allied concerns **rather than mitigate them**]{.underline}. [Military
cyber organizations may still conduct effect-based operations in allied
territory without consent, leading allies to assert that their
sovereignty has been violated]{.underline}. And there's another crucial
player involved. As Gen. Nakasone noted in the Joint Force Quarterly
article, cyberspace is owned largely by the private sector. They deserve
a seat at the table as well.

#### NATO's conventional deterrence is sufficient now- adding cyber to their core strategy risks disrupting the mission

Jeppe T **Jacobsen in 2021**

Ph.D. candidate at the Danish Institute for International Studies and
the Center for War Studies at the University of Southern Denmark;
International Affairs, Volume 97, Issue 3, May 2021, Pages 703--720,
https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiab010

The article makes three arguments in support of the overall argument
that¶ [NATO]{.underline} will (and [should) continue to play only a
limited offensive role in cyberspace.]{.underline} First, it identifies
four distinct cyber effects from the current debates on¶ major cyber
incidents presented in the cyber-conflict literature. This is done in¶
order to assess the operational challenges and possibilities for
successful integration of sovereign cyber effects in NATO operations,
also known as SCEPVA.8¶ [As]{.underline}¶ [cyber effects are often
costly in time and resources to develop]{.underline}, [difficult to
predict]{.underline}¶ and verify, **[and involve a risk of
confliction]{.underline}**, it is argued that the types of offensive¶
cyber operations that are highly destructive and specialized, with a
view to enabling ¶ other (kinetic) military effects, are the most
difficult to integrate. In contrast, less¶ complex disruptions used to
persistently annoy and confuse adversaries hold more¶ promise. In order
to work in NATO, these effects require more flexibility in the¶ way CYOC
sends requests to and interacts with the member states.¶ Second, in the
light of the renewed scholarly attention being given to NATO's¶ capacity
to deter Russia, the article unpacks and assesses the suggestion that a¶
centre for integrating offensive cyber effects contributes to NATO's
deterrence¶ posture.9¶ [It assesses the addition of cyber effects to
NATO's operational toolbox]{.underline}¶ [in the light of the (hybrid)
threat environment]{.underline} which is currently being articulated¶ in
NATO, and argues that **[such integration adds little to the existing
deterrence]{.underline}**¶ **[posture]{.underline}**. **[NATO's superior
conventional capabilities]{.underline}**---with or without cyber¶
effects---[already threaten punishment to adversaries who may consider
invading]{.underline}¶ [allied countries]{.underline}. Yet CYOC and the
alliance as a whole do not deter the more¶ frequent (hybrid) cyber
activity against member states that does not reach the¶ threshold of
armed conflict.¶ To elaborate on this argument, the article addresses,
thirdly, the question of¶ misinterpretation and escalation in
cyberspace. Despite being potentially counterintuitive to those scholars
who advocate a stronger NATO deterrence posture[, the]{.underline}¶
[limited offensive role of NATO in cyberspace and the alliance's
inability to deter]{.underline}¶ [the majority of malicious cyber
activity against member states is not necessarily]{.underline}¶ [a
problem]{.underline}. In fact, the article argues that [the reason why
we have yet to experience serious misinterpretation in cyberspace is
that most states' cyber activities]{.underline}¶ [seem implicitly to
accept an intelligence norm in cyberspace that embraces]{.underline}
acting¶ in legal grey zones and [staying under the threshold of armed
conflict]{.underline}. This norm¶ has offered an additional option on
the escalation ladder below armed attack,¶ but its continuation is
contingent on an intelligence logic---and not a military¶ logic---being
the dominant way of thinking in cyberspace. [As the current
strategic]{.underline}¶ [adaptation represents a return to a more
conventional military way of thinking,]{.underline}¶ [NATO's move to
present a dominant military force in cyberspace risks undermining the
status quo---which, so far, has avoided rapid escalation]{.underline}.

### Tech Focus

#### Plan leads to divisiveness among NATO members over strategy- some members prefer tech development outside of NATO to foster European autonomy-aff reinvigorates debates over dependence on the US

and trans-Atlantic defense; Brookings;
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/strategic-responsibility-rebalancing-european-and-trans-atlantic-defense/

Vladimir Putin's greatest achievement thus far in renewing his brutal
and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine has been to
reinvigorate the Atlantic alliance. [North American-European unity has
been remarkable]{.underline}, [exemplified by]{.underline} harsh and
complementary sanctions against Russia; efforts to wean Europe off its
dangerous dependence on Russian energy; military, financial, and
political support for Ukraine; and [actions to strengthen
NATO's]{.underline} own [defense]{.underline}.¶ **[A more corrosive
effect of Putin's war,]{.underline}** however, **[has been to deepen
even further Europe's strategic dependence on the United
States]{.underline}** --- **[a trend that had already become
unsustainable]{.underline}** even before the conflict began. As [the
alliance]{.underline} continues its most urgent task --- helping Ukraine
beat back Russia's assault --- it [must address this important
longer-term challenge of rebalancing trans-Atlantic
defense.]{.underline}¶ Doing so means squaring a triangle of issues:
ensuring Europe's capacity to defend itself against Russia and manage a
range of additional crises, many along its southern periphery;
addressing European aspirations for greater strategic autonomy; and
maintaining confidence that the United States can adequately uphold its
commitments in both the north Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific.¶ THE
AUTONOMY MUDDLE¶ [The term "strategic autonomy]{.underline}," popular in
some European circles and anathema in others, [stems]{.underline}
originally [from]{.underline} an earlier discourse within the French
strategic community to describe France's [ambition to]{.underline} boost
its military capabilities and [reduce]{.underline} its
[dependencies]{.underline} so that it could act alone if necessary to
protect French interests, beginning with crisis management operations in
Africa and along Europe's southern periphery. Of course, the European
Union (EU) has been trying to develop its capacity for military action
for some decades. Yet it was only in 2016 that the "strategic autonomy"
term was lifted to the EU level, with the publication of the bloc's
Global Strategy. The document "nurtures the ambition of strategic
autonomy for the European Union," but does not define the notion's
content or its implications.\[2\]¶ In the years that followed, [the term
gained traction in some EU countries as concerns in Europe mounted about
U.S. reliability]{.underline} as an ally under President Donald Trump,
**[China's rising technological]{.underline}** and norm-setting
**[challenges]{.underline}**, [and signs that the EU could be trampled
as the American and Chinese elephants collided]{.underline}. Debate was
further energized by signs of faltering European technological prowess,
and especially by the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposed European
dependencies across a number of health-related sectors.¶ Over time, [the
term began to assume a far more expansive meaning. European concerns
have spawned]{.underline} a raft of related phrases, such as "European
sovereignty," "economic sovereignty," "health sovereignty,"
"t**[echnological sovereignty," "data sovereignty," "cybersecurity
sovereignty," even "digital strategic autonomy.]{.underline}**" The
result, as one European observer noted, is a "muddle of words."¶
[European]{.underline} commentators and [leaders cloud
things]{.underline} further [by interpreting these assorted phrases very
differently]{.underline}, **[according to their diverse]{.underline}**
strategic cultures, threat **[perceptions, and calculations of
self-interest]{.underline}**.¶ Taken together, however, [this jumble
conveys a]{.underline} shared and [deeply-felt anxiety among many
Europeans that their grand experiment of integration is being
imperiled]{.underline} by internal weaknesses and external forces. In
all of its forms, [the autonomy narrative is meant to generate EU-wide
consensus behind ambitious]{.underline} and often-costly [initiatives to
bolster the bloc's technological]{.underline}, industrial, and
norm-setting [capabilities in ways that]{.underline} their proponents
believe [can]{.underline} preserve European competitiveness, lower
strategic dependencies, raise the EU's ability to resist geopolitical or
geoeconomic coercion, and **[give it more freedom to maneuver and shape
its environment]{.underline}**.¶ Until Russia's renewed invasion of
Ukraine in February 2022, [a theme central to the "strategic autonomy"
narrative was that the EU needed to be able to act
autonomously]{.underline}, without the United States. Since then,
however, Europe has become more rather than less reliant on the United
States. And while "[strategic autonomy" remains popular in some European
countries, **it rankled opinion in** **others**]{.underline},
[especially given the increased urgency of deterring and defending
against a revanchist Russia]{.underline}. Policymakers in Finland,
Estonia, and the Netherlands, among others, prefer to talk about
Europe's strategic responsibility, which entails more substantial
contributions to regional security, the readiness and ability to act
together rather than alone, and downplays implicit tradeoffs between a
strong Europe and a strong trans-Atlantic partnership.

#### Expanding NATO strategy to focus on disruptive technologies leads to internal conflict over priorities- allies perceive that it trades off with deterrence of Russia

147-168, DOI: 10.1080/00396338.2021.1982203

[The distinct risk of this charge is that it will add to NATO's
political--]{.underline}¶ [military tensions]{.underline}. Stoltenberg's
London mandate, and therefore the work of¶ [the Reflection Group, was
entirely political]{.underline}: **[there was no built-in
requirement]{.underline}**¶ **[to seek political--military
coherence]{.underline}**. Moreover, even if Stoltenberg has¶ so far
confined the Strategic Concept debate to the headquarters of the¶ North
Atlantic Council, thereby avoiding extensive committee work and¶
negotiations, he will not be able to imitate Rasmussen's tightly
controlled¶ process in 2010. In fact, NATO leaders have stipulated that
while the¶ secretary-general should 'lead' the Strategic Concept
process, the text 'will¶ be negotiated and agreed by the Council in
Permanent Session and endorsed¶ by NATO Leaders at the next Summit'.38¶
[The upside is that allied buy-in will increase]{.underline} compared
with 2010 and¶ thereafter. **[The downside is that the temptation to be
expansive in terms of]{.underline}**¶ **[priorities could
grow]{.underline}**. The 2020 Reflection Group, steered by the
secretarygeneral,¶ notably did not call for the slimming of NATO's core
tasks.39 [In a]{.underline}¶ [bid to build a consensus, the
secretary-general may feel tempted to lengthen]{.underline}¶ [the list
of core tasks, perhaps by]{.underline} [adding]{.underline} resilience,
[disruptive technology]{.underline},¶ pandemics and natural disasters.
[This temptation will be all the stronger]{.underline}¶ [given
that,]{.underline} in the meantime, **[NATO has decided to 'mainstream'
the challenges]{.underline}**¶ **[posed by China into the Alliance's
many policy portfolios]{.underline}**.40¶ In short, [NATO is approaching
a revised Strategic Concept with]{.underline}, on the¶ one hand, [a
political temptation to go big and, on the other, a
Russia-centric]{.underline}¶ [approach to military
planning]{.underline}. To steer clear of further political--military¶
tensions and even rupture, NATO allies should 1) prioritise collective¶
defence; 2) develop a values-based narrative; and 3) intensify its
internal¶ political--military dialogue.

### US Link

#### The US will cause NATO fracture over the plan- the will push for development that benefits US industry and fight against European autonomy

https://www.brookings.edu/articles/strategic-responsibility-rebalancing-european-and-trans-atlantic-defense/

[U.S. support for greater European defense efforts has always been
conditional]{.underline}. Successive [U.S. administrations have
supported European moves to bolster their defense capabilities, provided
that such efforts would strengthen]{.underline}, rather than weaken, the
political cohesion of [the]{.underline} Atlantic [alliance]{.underline}.
Those conditions were framed most prominently in 1998 by former U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Following a U.K.-France meeting
at St. Malo, at which London and Paris declared that the EU "must have
the capacity for autonomous action," Secretary Albright penned a piece
in the Financial Times stating that [U.S. support for greater European
efforts would be contingent on avoiding "three D's:"
discrimination]{.underline} against non-EU NATO members,
[decoupling]{.underline} of European and North American security, [and
duplication]{.underline} of NATO's operational planning system or its
command structure. "No duplication" was neither defined nor intended to
mean that Europe should not develop certain capabilities that already
existed in the alliance; indeed, much of the Clinton administration's
efforts at the time, such as the NATO Defense Capability Initiative,
sought to prod the Europeans into developing precisely such
capabilities. This distinction has been lost on analysts who have
posited that the United States has opposed any European moves to improve
their capacity to act.\[3\]¶ [U.S. concerns have centered more on the
danger of competition and duplication with NATO structures]{.underline}
and planning processes, [along with doubts about the capacity of
European militaries to conduct even small-scale operations]{.underline}
without U.S. support. [While the United States has consistently pressed
European allies for greater defense contributions, it has preferred that
such efforts be undertaken to strengthen NATO]{.underline}, [rather than
to enhance independent efforts]{.underline} that it feared could drain
attention away from common defense efforts. **[Competition between U.S.
and European defense contractors has exacerbated tensions over these
issues.]{.underline}**

## Impacts

### Now Key

#### Now is a key time- failure to maintain cohesion risks a fundamental alliance rift

Jens **Ringsmose &** Sten **Rynning in 2021**

NATO's Next Strategic Concept: Prioritise or Perish; Survival, 63:5,
147-168, DOI: 10.1080/00396338.2021.1982203

[NATO's post-Crimea adaptation tells the story. NATO responded
with]{.underline}¶ [political vigour]{.underline}, condemning Russia and
placing the burden of change on¶ Moscow while bolstering its own defence
and deterrence posture. [However,]{.underline}¶ [internal political
limitations meant that NATO did not develop its thinking]{.underline}¶
[on the nature of the threat and the effects that would serve to deter
it]{.underline}. By¶ 2016, when Trump burst onto the scene, NATO's
capacity for such in-depth¶ political thinking seemed non-existent. The
military authorities seized the¶ initiative, crafting a new military
strategy centred on desired effects and¶ deterrence. This first real
strategy since the adoption in 1967 of NATO's¶ Flexible Response
strategy was then met with political ambivalence.¶ **[NATO needs to get
its strategic house in order]{.underline}**. [The
political--military]{.underline}¶ [divide outlined in this article is
real but not yet alarming; **a failure to tend**]{.underline}¶ **[to it
in the new Strategic Concept would sound the alarm]{.underline}**.
[Confronting]{.underline}¶ [Russia]{.underline} while competing with
China, digesting the lessons of Afghanistan¶ [and developing a range of
policy competences in cybe]{.underline}r, resilience, outer¶ space,
capacity-building and more **[is indeed a tall political
order]{.underline}**. **[Strategy is]{.underline}**¶ **[about
priorities, however, and NATO's priorities must bridge the
political--]{.underline}**¶ **[military divide]{.underline}**. Thus, the
new Strategic Concept could do worse than¶ establish collective defence
as an overriding priority; wrap it in a narrative¶ of democratic values
necessitating both a rebalanced NATO and collective¶ defence; and invite
continuous political--military dialogue on military¶ technology and its
strategic implications.

The [**Biden** administration **can** also **use the crisis in Ukraine**
as an opportunity **to** reshape the military landscape
and [**revitalize U.S.
leadership**](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2022-03-14/return-pax-americana) on
the continent.]{.underline} One element of that should be an increase in
the size of the U.S. military presence in Europe. That should include
enhancing the U.S. posture in the Baltic States, Poland, and Romania, as
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley recently suggested.
The United States should set up permanent bases on the eastern flank of
NATO to help reassure allies on the front lines of Russian aggression,
significantly bolstering the pre-crisis rotational presence that
numbered only in the low thousands. This could include at least three
additional U.S. Army brigade-equivalent units permanently stationed in
Poland, Romania, and Germany that would continually rotate through other
vulnerable eastern flank nations, including the Baltics. This should be
coupled with enhancing U.S. naval presence in the waters of the
Mediterranean and the North Atlantic, increasing both consistent
deployments and naval exercises with our Western partners.
[NATO]{.underline}, meanwhile, [can be enhanced]{.underline} both by
welcoming Sweden and Finland, which are newly considering membership,
and by **[tightening NATO ties]{.underline}** with critical Pacific
allies---**[turn]{.underline}**ing [**the** NATO **alliance into an
essential hub of Western military cooperation** around the
globe]{.underline}. The recent NATO announcement on enhanced cooperation
with Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea was a good step.
[This cooperation should be codified]{.underline} in NATO's Strategic
Concept at the upcoming Madrid Summit in June, and include more frequent
military exercises and exchanges, both in Europe and the Pacific. Such
steps are necessary [even as the war in Ukraine continues to
rage]{.underline}. [**The opportunity** that **the U**nited **S**tates
**has** today---**to revitalize the** transatlantic **alliance **for the
long haul---**won't last long**. **If used wisely, it can** reinforce
military cooperation while **build**ing **a super bloc of Western
economies. Letting it slip** by **would be a massive**---and
unforced---**strategic error.**]{.underline}

[Russia]{.underline} has shown that it is ready to murder innocent
Ukrainians, but it [is not ready to commit suicide.]{.underline} And
[that holds the key to preventing further Russian aggression, and more
unspeakable tragedies]{.underline}, in Ukraine and elsewhere.
BERKELEY/STOCKHOLM -- Anyone who does not want war would do well to
recall an enduring lesson from the Cold War: [**parties will be deterred
from fighting if they know** in advance that **they will lose
everything**.]{.underline} With Russian President Vladimir Putin
threatening to use nuclear weapons if the West tries to intervene
militarily in Ukraine, [**NATO must revive the doctrine of mutual
assured destruction** (MAD).]{.underline} The logic of MAD was dismal
but not crazy. Both the Soviet Union and the United States (or any other
NATO member) knew that if one attacked the other, it would be
annihilated in response. [The key to the MAD equilibrium was that the
aggressor's annihilation would be assured if it launched an
attack.]{.underline} This guarantee that the other side would retaliate
with full force took a variety of forms, from the nuclear triad to the
hardline stance of military commanders like former US Air Force General
Curtis LeMay. The result was that neither superpower wanted to attack
first, keeping the Cold War cold. MAD may have seemed obsolete after the
Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but [Putin's recent nuclear threats have
raised troubling questions that the doctrine helps to
address.]{.underline} For example, would the West retaliate if Russia
used nuclear weapons against Ukraine and a radioactive cloud covered
Europe? What if the Russian army blew up a nuclear power plant in
Ukraine? Where does one draw the line? [The West's common theme in such
scenarios must be to assure Russia of inevitable
consequences]{.underline}. This [means committing to strike back and
communicating to Russia that even a "small" nuclear attack or accident
would trigger a devastating response.]{.underline} The potentially
blurred boundaries of what constitutes an attack (a Russian missile
might hit a NATO base or convoy, for example) broadens the range of
triggers. In the 1950s, US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
indicated that any attack -- with conventional or nuclear forces --
would lead to the aggressor's annihilation. Furthermore, the [MAD logic
dictates that one can achieve de-escalation through
escalation.]{.underline} If Russia adopts an aggressive posture and puts
its nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles on a high state of
readiness[, **NATO must respond** in kind to signal that it is **ready
to react**]{.underline}. A [failure to do so could be interpreted as a
**lack of commitment** and thus **invite more aggressive Russian
behavior.** The 1962 Cuban missile crisis involved a real-life
application of the MAD strategy. By placing nuclear missiles on Cuba,
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev intended to scare the US and thus
extract concessions from President John F. Kennedy, whom Khrushchev
perceived to be "soft." Had the Kennedy administration caved in,
Khrushchev's nuclear blackmail would have terrorized the US for years.
Understanding the MAD logic, Kennedy responded by placing US strategic
forces at DEFCON 2 (ready to deploy and engage in less than six hours).
Facing the prospect of triggering a nuclear war (DEFCON 1) and ensuring
mutual annihilation, Khrushchev backed down, the crisis was defused, and
the Soviet Union never again risked a nuclear confrontation with NATO.
The 1961 US-Soviet standoff at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin was a
similar case of escalation resulting in long-term de-escalation: the
Soviet bloc never again questioned West Berlin's status. Unfortunately,
the world seems to have forgotten the importance of standing up to a
bully with nuclear weapons. Remember that MAD was about the balance of
terror: lose the balance and all that remains is terror. Today, **NATO
must balance Russian threats** to use nukes with **a commitment to
retaliate** in kind, and meet Putin's escalation with escalation of its
own. In a MAD world, caving in to nuclear intimidation is a sign of
weakness that makes a war more likely.]{.underline}

#### Prioritizing deterrence is key to prevent Russian aggression

The [**security** and prosperity **of the transatlantic
community**]{.underline}, [including the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, **[rests on]{.underline}** the foundation of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (**[NATO]{.underline}**).
[Russia's]{.underline} ongoing war of naked [aggression against
Ukraine]{.underline}, [a NATO non-member state, should]{.underline} put
to [rest any]{.underline} lingering [questions about the modern utility
of the Alliance]{.underline} and about which threat should be the focus
of NATO's upcoming strategic concept. [The answer is clear: The U.S.
must lead the Alliance to]{.underline} a [wholesale refocusing on the
organization's raison d'être of collective defense]{.underline}. While
the Alliance faces challenges emanating from an unstable Mediterranean
basin and terrorism originating from the Middle East, the fact remains
that **[Russia continues to be the only existential threat to member
states]{.underline}**. [**NATO must** send a strong signal that it is
**strengthen**ing **deterrence measures explicitly in response to** the
increased **threat from Russia.**]{.underline} Deterrence measures
should include an Alliance-wide recommitment to defense spending; a
persistent and continuing U.S. presence in Eastern European member
states; updated Alliance operational planning in light of Russia's
position in Belarus and Ukraine; and an increase in U.S. air, ground,
and naval forces in the European theater as a sign of continued
commitment to the NATO treaty's Article 5. These deterrence measures
must be carried out with the recognition that, from a long-term
perspective, China is the largest peer challenger from whom the U.S.
must expect hostile action. Any improvements to the U.S. force posture
must not be to the detriment of the nation's ability to counter China.
From the Arctic to the Levant, [Russia remains an aggressive and capable
threat to NATO]{.underline} and the interests of its members. For member
states [in Eastern Europe, Russia represents a]{.underline} real and
potentially **[existential threat]{.underline}**. [Russia's entrenched
position in Belarus, along with]{.underline} its ongoing [actions to
cleave Ukraine, a nation that borders four NATO members,]{.underline} in
two, [scramble the geostrategic map of Europe]{.underline} and
necessitate changes to NATO operational planning, [exemplifying the need
for the Alliance to take swift and resolute steps to bolster deterrence
measures along its eastern flank.]{.underline}

### Russia War/Miscalc

#### Unified NATO key to deter Russia, prevent miscalc, and maintain international stability

Following his election victory, Prime Minister Trudeau and his new
government [urgently need to address the multiple security and foreign
policy challenges]{.underline} facing Canada and our allies. [These
include the persistent and growing threats of foreign interference and
cyber operations]{.underline} targeting Canada[, and the danger of
Russia and China]{.underline}'s transnational repression, human rights
violations and aggression in Europe, Asia and beyond. Of particular
concern to Canada and its Northern allies is the Kremlin's rapid
militarization of the Arctic and Russia's recent claim to all the
resources under the entire Arctic Sea -- right up to Canada's 200-mile
Exclusive Economic Zone. This, coupled with China's expanding interest
in the region, represents a potential future challenge to Canada's
sovereignty and mobility in the High North. [Canada's allies on NATO's
Eastern flank continue to face various forms of aggression from Russia
and Belarus, including information warfare and other forms of grey-zone
hybrid aggression.]{.underline} Most recently, the Lukashenka regime in
Belarus has weaponized thousands of innocent migrants who have been
lured to Belarus from Iraq and elsewhere, and then forced to cross into
Lithuania, Latvia and Poland by Belarusian authorities. The migrants are
used to destabilize border regions and incite domestic political
conflict. Many of these issues were discussed during a high-level
dialogue on Canadian and Baltic Sea region security and cooperation,
hosted by the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. The dialogue highlighted the
strengths of some of the approaches Canada has taken, lead among them
being the Canadian-led NATO enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) mission in
Latvia and Operation Unifier in Ukraine. Canada's leadership of the eFP
in Latvia helps strengthen the transatlantic relationship beyond the
obvious security considerations. Through it, Canada can raise its
diplomatic profile and develop significant and lasting linkages between
government officials, diplomats, and experts in the Baltic Sea region.
Thus, when Canada faces challenging issues such as the arbitrary
detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor by China, NATO members
can be counted on to support us. Most importantly, the [eFP represents
clear, meaningful, and targeted deterrence. It imposes significant cost
if the Russian government engages in hostile action against the Baltic
states]{.underline} or Poland. [It draws a definitive red line, which if
violated will result in significant consequences]{.underline}. However,
[NATO's deterrence operations remain largely limited to conventional
warfare]{.underline} and do not yet fully cover evolving hybrid and
grey-zone threats -- including information warfare and other forms of
interference operations. The Canadian Armed Forces have endeavoured to
address the threat of disinformation, but those efforts have been
hindered by a series of unfortunate missteps and domestic misinformation
about them. Conversely, Canada's Baltic allies have developed robust
strategies to build broad social and political resilience against
foreign disinformation and influence operations. Canada should be
[working with]{.underline} them and [NATO to form a common strategy to
deter non-linear types of warfare and aggression, which threaten our
democratic processes, institutions and social cohesion. Cautious
engagement with our adversaries should remain one tool within our
broader diplomatic tool kit.]{.underline} Yet Canada should learn from
the experiences of our allies and [recognize that states like Russia and
China are not constrained by the same respect for transparency,
democratic values, or the rule of law]{.underline}. The Canadian
government should be aware that foreign regimes may engage in the
theatre of diplomacy to distract from their true intentions and actions.
[There is also concern that tolerating Russian aggression and advocating
for greater engagement and integration may only further encourage bad
behaviour.]{.underline} In the case of Nord Stream 2, for example, some
NATO members have knowingly increased European dependence on Russian
energy resources despite the Kremlin's well documented use of energy as
a political tool. [**A united NATO is critically important to projecting
credible deterrence.** The erosion of domestic trust and confidence in
the Alliance among its member states,]{.underline} including Canada,
[represents a threat to this cohesion]{.underline}. A proposal to
withdraw Canada from NATO was tabled at a recent policy conference for
one of Canada's three major political parties. The proposal was
defeated, but it represents a fringe anti-NATO narrative within Canada's
illiberal left; if left unaddressed, such a narrative could grow. [If
countries like Russia perceive NATO as an atomized collection of states
with varied priorities rather than a unified front, the Alliance is
exposed to a significant risk of miscalculation in which a foreign
adversary might believe they can cross a red line and only face a
limited response.]{.underline} Thus, [gaps in cohesion within the
alliance directly threaten to undermine political and military
deterrence.]{.underline} The [Alliance and members states must work
towards improving communications strategies to foster greater basic
general understanding of NATO's purpose, its missions and its role in
protecting its members against external threats.]{.underline} Similarly,
if we see threats as atomized or disparate, we may lack the capacity to
adequately respond. Organized GRU terrorist attacks in Czechia, the
Salisbury poisonings, transnational repression and censorship,
cyberwarfare, disinformation, and overt military posturing all pose
threats that are aimed at the same essential goal: undermining and
supplanting the power of liberal democracy and advancing
authoritarianism. Through this lens, [challenges posed by other actors,
including China, must also be considered as part of the broader range of
shared threats posed to the democratic community as a
whole.]{.underline} If we are to succeed in tackling these shared
threats, greater transatlantic cooperation is needed. It cannot remain
stagnant, however; it must evolve and expand. The serious nature of the
threats, their potential to become kinetic, and the possibility of
adversarial coordination (whether formal or informal) means that we must
expand our tools to meet these challenges. In the case of Ukraine, on
whose border the Kremlin mobilized over 100,000 troops this past summer,
the Alliance should consider extending a Membership Action Plan despite
the skepticism of some allies. Ukraine must also be empowered in a
similar fashion to frontline NATO states like the Baltic states and
Poland. After all, the eFP mission in Latvia not only provides military
deterrence, but strengthens interlinkages, develops societal resilience,
and provides clear and sustained solidarity. Finally, the growing
threats of foreign interference, information warfare, cyber attacks and
emerging threats to Canada's Arctic requires a coherent long-term
strategy and an evolved notion of collective defence, which includes
strengthening our partnerships with non-NATO allies in Europe, Asia, and
around the world. Until we impose consequences that force Moscow and
Beijing to strategically reconsider their ongoing efforts to probe the
extreme boundaries of our threat tolerance, they will continue to test
our capacity and political will to confront their aggression. [This
requires a common understanding and acknowledgement of the
threats.]{.underline} It took Russian aggression in 2007 in Estonia,
2008 in Georgia, and the invasion of Ukraine in 2014 to achieve a basic
common understanding of the threat posed by Vladimir Putin's government.
Since then, NATO's eFP missions have thus far deterred Vladimir Putin's
neo-imperialist ambitions in the Baltic Sea region. [We must work
towards achieving a similar consensus on the threats posed by Russia and
China's use of information and influence operations]{.underline}, as
well as economic, cyber and political warfare against the community of
democracies and the developing world at large in order to develop
resilience and a common defence against them.

Russia-NATO Conflict: Implications for Deterrence Stability,"

Escalation: Can a NATO - Russia conflict be managed?¶ [Once a conflict
was **under way**, the "**fog of war**" and **rising unpredictability**
would **inevitably** set in, **complicating** the implementation of
any]{.underline} predetermined theories of escalation, deescalation and
inter-[conflict management. The **actual** dynamics of]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline} and the perceptions of the stakes involved [are
**extremely difficult** to predict. Simulations]{.underline} and
table-top exercises can [give]{.underline} only [limited
insights]{.underline} into the actual decision-making processes and
interactions.¶ Still, [Russian military theorists]{.underline} and
practitioners seem to **[assume]{.underline}** that [a conflict with
NATO can be **managed** and **controlled** in a way that would bring it
to a **swift end** consistent with Russian aims. The Russian **theory of
victory**]{.underline} would [seek to **exploit weak points** in an
Alliance war effort. Based on the **conviction** that democracies are
weak and]{.underline} their leaders and populations are [risk-averse,
Russia may **assume** that]{.underline} its [threats of **horizontal**
or **vertical escalation** could be]{.underline} particularly
[effective. It would]{.underline} also [try to bring home the
notion]{.underline} that [it has **much higher stakes** in the
conflict]{.underline} (regime survival) [than]{.underline} a majority of
the [NATO members]{.underline} involved, [and]{.underline} thus [will be
ready to **push the boundaries** of]{.underline} the [conflict further.
It would]{.underline} most likely [try to **test** and **exploit**
potential **divisions** within the Alliance, combining **selective
diplomacy** and **activation** of its intelligence assets
in]{.underline} some [NATO states]{.underline} with a degree of
selectivity in terms of targets of particular attacks.¶ [**Any**
NATO-Russia conflict would **inevitably** have a **nuclear dimension**.
The role of **nuclear weapons** as a tool for **escalation control** for
Russia has been]{.underline} thoroughly [debated by experts, but
when]{.underline} and how [Russia might use]{.underline} (and not merely
showcase or activate) [nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an **open
question**. Beyond]{.underline} catch phrases such as ["**escalate to
de-escalate**"]{.underline} or "escalate to win" [there are a **wider
range** of options for Russian **nuclear weapon use**]{.underline}. For
example, [a single **nuclear warning shot** could be lethal or
non-lethal. It could be directed against a]{.underline} purely [military
target or a]{.underline} military-[civilian one. Detonation could be
configured for an **EMP effect**. A "**false flag**" attack
is]{.underline} also [conceivable. These options]{.underline} might be
used to [**signal escalation** and could **significantly complicate**
NATO's responses]{.underline}.¶ Neither NATO nor its member states have
developed a similar theory of victory. Public NATO documents stipulate
the general goals for the Alliance: defend against any armed attack and,
as needed, restore the full sovereignty and territorial integrity of
member states. [It is less clear how far the Alliance would be **willing
to escalate** the conflict]{.underline} to achieve these goals, [and
what mechanisms]{.underline} and means [it would use while trying to
maintain]{.underline} some degree of [control]{.underline} over the
conflict.¶ [The goals]{.underline} and methods [of waging a conflict
with Russia would]{.underline} probably [have to be limited in order to
avoid a **massive nuclear exchange**. Such limitations]{.underline}
would also involve restrictions on striking back against targets on
Russian territory. But too narrow an approach [could put **too much
restraint** on NATO's operations: the Russian **regime's stability**
may]{.underline} ultimately [need to be threatened]{.underline} in order
[to **force the leadership** into **terminating** the
conflict]{.underline}. NATO would thus need to establish what a
proportional self-defence response to Russian actions would involve, and
to what extent cyber operations or attacks against military targets in
quite different parts of Russia would be useful as tools of escalation
to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover, individual NATO Allies, especially
those directly affected by Russia's actions, might pursue their
individual strategies of escalation.¶ With regards to the nuclear
dimension in NATO escalation plans, given the stakes involved, this
element would most likely be handled by the three nuclear-weapon members
of the Alliance, with the US taking the lead. The existence of three
independent centres of nuclear decision-making could be exploited to
complicate Russian planning and introduce uncertainty into the Russian
strategic calculus, but some degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination
would be beneficial. This coordination would not necessarily focus on
nuclear targeting, but rather on designing coordinated operations to
demonstrate resolve in order to keep the conflict below the nuclear
threshold, or bring it back under the threshold after first use.¶
[Relying on concepts of **escalation control**]{.underline} and on
lessons [from the Cold War]{.underline} confrontation [might be
**misleading**. The circumstances in which a **Russia-NATO conflict**
would play out would be **radically different** from the 20th
century]{.underline} screenplay. Moreover, [instead of
**gradual**]{.underline} (linear) [escalation or **salami tactics**
escalation, it is possible to imagine]{.underline} surprizing ["**leap
frog**" escalation]{.underline}, possibly [connected]{.underline} with
actions [in **different domains**]{.underline} (e.g. a cyberattack
against critical infrastructure). Flexibility, good intelligence and
inventiveness in responding to such developments would be crucial.¶
Conflict termination¶ [Russian and NATO assumptions regarding conflict
termination would]{.underline} most likely [**not survive** the **first
hours** of]{.underline} an [actual conflict. Both sides are capable of
**underestimating** the **resolve** of the other side to
prevail]{.underline} in a conflict [and the other side's **willingness**
to]{.underline} commit the necessary resources and [endure the costs,
especially once both]{.underline} sides [start committing]{.underline}
their [political capital]{.underline} and resources and the casualties
accumulate.

#### Breaking NATO causes Russian aggression that escalates to nuclear war

**Beauchamp 18** 

\[Zack, senior correspondent at Vox, where he covers global politics and
ideology, "How Trump is killing America's alliances,"
6/12/18, <https://www.vox.com/world/2018/6/12/17448866/trump-south-korea-alliance-trudeau-g7>\] 

How **[the weakening of American alliances could lead to a massive
war. ]{.underline}**There has never, in human history, been an era as
peaceful as our own. This is a hard truth to appreciate, given the
horrible violence ongoing in places like Syria, Yemen, and Myanmar, yet
the evidence is quite clear. Take a look at this chart from the
University of Oxford's Max Roser. It tracks the number of years in a
given time period in which "great powers" --- meaning the militarily and
economically powerful countries at that time --- were at war with each
other over the course of the past 500 years. The decline is
unmistakable: \[\[TABLE OMITTED\]\] This data should give you some
appreciation for how unique, and potentially precarious, our historical
moment is. For more than 200 years, from 1500 to about 1750, major
European powers like Britain and France and Spain were warring
constantly. The frequency of conflict declined in the 19th and 20th
centuries, but the wars that did break out --- the Napoleonic conflicts,
both world wars --- were particularly devastating. The past 70 years
without great power war, a period scholars term "the Long Peace," is one
of history's most wonderful anomalies. The question then becomes: Why
did it happen? And could Trump mucking around with a pillar of the
global order, American alliances, put it in jeopardy? The answer to the
second question, ominously, appears to be yes. **[There is significant
evidence that strong American alliances --- most notably the NATO
alliance and US agreements to defend Japan and South Korea --- have been
instrumental in putting an end to great power war. "As this alliance
system spreads and expands, it correlates with this dramatic decline,
this unprecedented drop, in warfare,"]{.underline}** says Michael
Beckley, a professor of international relations at Tufts University.
"**[It's a really, really strong correlation." ]{.underline}**A 2010
study by Rice's Leeds and the University of Kentucky's Jesse C. Johnson
surveyed a large data set on alliances between 1816 and 2000. They found
that countries in defensive alliances were 20 percent less likely to be
involved in a conflict, on average, than countries that weren't. **[This
holds true even after you control for other factors that would affect
the likelihood of war]{.underline}**, like whether a country is a
democracy or whether it has an ongoing dispute with a powerful neighbor.
In a follow-up paper, Leeds and Johnson looked at the same data set to
see whether certain kinds of alliances were more effective at protecting
its members than others. Their conclusion is that alliances deter war
best when their members are militarily powerful and when enemies take
seriously the allies' promise to fight together in the event of an
attack. The core US alliances --- NATO, Japan, and South Korea --- fit
these descriptors neatly. A third study finds evidence that alliances
allow allies to restrain each other from going to war. Let's say Canada
wants to get involved in a conflict somewhere. Typically, it would
discuss its plans with the United States first --- and if America thinks
it's a bad idea, Canada might well listen to them. There's strong
statistical evidence that countries don't even try to start some
conflicts out of fear that an ally would disapprove. These three
findings all suggest that **[NATO and America's East Asian alliances
very likely are playing a major role in preserving the Long
Peace]{.underline}** --- which is why Trump's habit of messing around
with alliances is so dangerous. According to many Russia experts,
Vladimir **[Putin's deepest geostrategic goal is "breaking"
NATO.]{.underline}** The member states where anyone would expect him to
test NATO's commitment would be the Baltics --- Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania --- small former Soviet republics that recently became NATO
members. We can't predict if and when a rival like Putin would conclude
that America's alliances seemed weak enough to try testing them.
Hopefully, it never happens. But the more Trump attacks the foundations
of America's allies, the more likely things are to change. **[The
absolute risk of a Russian invasion of a NATO state]{.underline}** or a
North Korean attack on the South is relatively low, but the
consequences **[are so potentially catastrophic --- nuclear war! ---
that it's worth taking anything that increases the odds of such a
conflict seriously.]{.underline}** The crack-up of the West? The world
order is a little like a game of Jenga. In the game, there are lots of
small blocks that interlock to form a stable tower. Each player has
to remove a block without toppling the tower. But each time you take out
a block, the whole thing gets a bit less stable. Take out enough blocks
and it will collapse. The international order works in kind of the same
way. There are lots of different interlocking parts --- the spread of
democracy, American alliances, nuclear deterrence, and the like --- that
work together to keep the global peace. But take out one block and the
other ones might not be strong enough to keep things together on their
own. At the end of the Cold War, British and French leaders worried that
the passing of the old order might prove destabilizing. In a January
1990 meeting, French President François Mitterrand told British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher that he feared a united Germany could seize
control of even more territory than Hitler. Some experts feared that in
the absence of the external Soviet threat, Western European powers might
go back to waging war with each other. Thankfully, those predictions
turned out to be wrong. There are multiple reasons for that, but one big
one --- one that also helped keep relations between other historical
enemies, like South Korea and Japan, peaceful --- is a shared
participation in US alliance networks. The US serves as the ultimate
security blanket, preventing these countries from having to build up
their own armaments and thus risk a replay of World War I. But **[if
American alliance commitments become and remain less credible, it's
possible this order could crack up. ]{.underline}**America's partners
aren't stupid. They understand that Trump is the product of deep forces
in American politics, and that his victory might not be a one-off. If
they think that this won't be the last "America First" president in
modern history, depending on America the way that they have in the past
could quickly become a nightmare. **[The worst-case scenarios for a
collapse in the US alliance system are terrible. Imagine full Japanese
and German rearmament, alongside rapid-fire proliferation of nuclear
weapons. Imagine a crack-up of NATO, with European powers at loggerheads
while Russia gobbles up the Baltic states and the rest of Ukraine.
Imagine South Korea's historical tensions with Japan reigniting, and a
war between those two countries]{.underline}** or any combination of
them and China. All of this seems impossible to imagine now, almost
absurd. And indeed, in the short run, it is. There is no risk --- zero
--- of American allies turning on each other in the foreseeable future.
And it's possible that the next president after Trump could reassure
American allies that nothing like this could ever happen again. But the
truth is that there's just no way to know. **[When a fundamental force
for world peace starts to weaken, no one can really be sure how well the
system will hold up. Nothing like this --- the leader of the world's
hegemon rounding on its most important allies --- has ever happened
before]{.underline}**. What Donald Trump's presidency has done, in
effect, is start up another geopolitical Jenga game. Slowly but surely,
he's removing the blocks that undergird global security. It's possible
the global order survives Trump --- but it's just too early for us to
say for sure. **[Given the stakes, it's a game we'd rather not
play.]{.underline}**

The Alliance of [NATO]{.underline}, since its inception, has been [based
on]{.underline} four main pillars: [ideological, political, economic and
military]{.underline}. Ideologically, the Member States share
fundamental principles such as individual freedom, democracy, the rule
of law and sovereignty of the state. Politically, there is a necessity
for consensus among the member states on common interests, objectives
and commitments. From the economic viewpoint, the Allies pledge to incur
the designated military expenditures and other security-related
expenditures---they commit to cost-sharing. With regard to the military
organization, [**NATO** is based on the principle of **strong,
integrated, organized, well-trained, efective and mobile
troops.**]{.underline} NATO achieves its objectives by upscaling its
readiness, response and military capabilities to deter an adversary. It
aims at [maintaining military forces]{.underline} in the right place and
time capable of deterring or, if necessary, [repelling an
adversary]{.underline}. In this context, [**NATO leaders**, who are
aware of the fact that **unity is essential for success**, comply with
the principles of "**cohesion**" and "coherence".]{.underline} Hence,
"[cohesion]{.underline}" and "coherence" have become distinctive
[indicators of NATO's **current strategic concept**]{.underline}.
According to the former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen,
"the [Alliance that cannot ensure collective defence loses cohesion in
achieving collective security]{.underline}". In order to clarify the
principles that are crucial for the implementation of the new strategy,
it is necessary to understand what "NATO's cohesion" and "NATO's
coherence" mean.1 [**NATO's cohesion** means a level of **political and
ideological unity**]{.underline} as well as [solidarity]{.underline}
between the members of the Pact. It mainly refers to the principles on
which the Alliance is based. This is particularly true of the Member
States' commitment to collective defence, threats and challenges facing
the Alliance. NATO's coherence refers to [**consensus** among the Member
States in order to **guarantee** the Alliance's capabilities and
capacities necessary to ensure the **efective implementation** of
**NATO's missions**.]{.underline} It involves strategic plans, resource
requirements, material capabilities, operational procedures, command
structures, the number of soldiers and logistical infrastructure (Hodges
et al. 2019). The dynamics of events after 2014 as well as the emergence
of new international threats (e.g. ISIS, refugees, epidemics) has led to
increasing expenditures on security and collective defence (Grygiel and
Wess Mitchell 2014). This issue seems to be extremely important and
therefore still remains within the realm of discussions among the
politicians and bodies responsible for the state security. With time and
transformations in geopolitical and military situations in the world,
the requirements for the North Atlantic Pact have also changed, which
has inspired the authors to write this article.

[**A united NATO is critically important to projecting credible
deterrence**. The erosion of domestic trust and confidence in the
Alliance]{.underline} among its member states, including Canada,
[represents a threat to this cohesion]{.underline}. A proposal to
withdraw Canada from NATO was tabled at a recent policy conference for
one of Canada's three major political parties. The proposal was
defeated, but it represents a fringe anti-NATO narrative within Canada's
illiberal left; if left unaddressed, such a narrative could grow. [**If
countries like Russia perceive NATO** as an atomized collection of
states **with varied priorities rather than** a **unified** front, **the
Alliance is exposed to a significant risk of miscalc**ulation in which a
foreign adversary might believe they can **cross a red line and only
face a limited response.**]{.underline} Thus, gaps in cohesion within
the alliance directly threaten to undermine political and military
deterrence[.]{.underline} [The Alliance and members states must work
towards improving]{.underline} communications strategies to foster
greater [basic general understanding of NATO's purpose, its missions and
its role in protecting its members against external
threats.]{.underline} Similarly, if we see threats as atomized or
disparate, we may lack the capacity to adequately respond. Organized GRU
terrorist attacks in Czechia, the Salisbury poisonings, transnational
repression and censorship, cyberwarfare, disinformation, and overt
military posturing all pose threats that are aimed at the same essential
goal: undermining and supplanting the power of liberal democracy and
advancing authoritarianism. Through this lens, challenges posed by other
actors, including China, must also be considered as part of the broader
range of shared threats posed to the democratic community as a whole.
[If we are to succeed in tackling]{.underline} these [shared threats,
greater transatlantic cooperation is needed.]{.underline} It cannot
remain stagnant, however; it must evolve and expand. The serious nature
of the threats, their potential to become kinetic, and the possibility
of adversarial coordination (whether formal or informal) means that we
must expand our tools to meet these challenges. In the case of Ukraine,
on whose border the Kremlin mobilized over 100,000 troops this past
summer, the Alliance should consider extending a Membership Action Plan
despite the skepticism of some allies. Ukraine must also be empowered in
a similar fashion to frontline NATO states like the Baltic states and
Poland. After all, the eFP mission in Latvia not only provides military
deterrence, but strengthens interlinkages, develops societal resilience,
and provides clear and sustained solidarity. Finally, the growing
threats of foreign interference, information warfare, cyber attacks and
emerging threats to Canada's Arctic requires a coherent long-term
strategy and an evolved notion of collective defence, which includes
strengthening our partnerships with non-NATO allies in Europe, Asia, and
around the world[.]{.underline} Until we impose consequences that force
Moscow and Beijing to strategically reconsider their ongoing efforts to
probe the extreme boundaries of our threat tolerance, they will continue
to test our capacity and political will to confront their aggression.
This requires a common understanding and acknowledgement of the
threats[. It took Russian aggression in 2007 in Estonia, 2008 in
Georgia, and the invasion of Ukraine in 2014 to achieve a]{.underline}
basic common [understanding of the threat posed by Vladimir Putin's
government]{.underline}. Since then, NATO's eFP missions have thus far
deterred Vladimir Putin's neo-imperialist ambitions in the Baltic Sea
region. [We must work towards achieving a similar consensus on the
threats posed by Russia and China's use of information and influence
operations]{.underline}, as well as economic, cyber and political
warfare against the community of democracies and the developing world at
large i[n order to develop resilience and a common defence against
them.]{.underline}

### US Hegemony

#### NATO cohesion is key to free up US resources to maintain global hegemony and counter a rising China

Ben **Hodges' 18** ( Frederick Benjamin \"Ben\" Hodges III is a retired
United States Army officer who served as commanding general, United
States Army Europe. He is currently the Pershing Chair in Strategic
Studies at the Center for European Policy Analysis, "Improving NATO's
cohesion is critical to combat Russia and China's threat: Marcus Kolga

[If a conflict with China arises, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will need a strong, cohesive NATO]{.underline}, as
well as other partnerships around the [world to maintain order and
security]{.underline} in Europe's neighborhood, [and]{.underline}
perhaps even [beyond]{.underline}. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [remains committed to Europe's security and
stability. But i]{.underline}t [also expects]{.underline} its [European
allies to]{.underline} pick up their [share]{.underline} of [the burden
for collective security]{.underline} so as to help maintain order in the
continent and around the globe. [It is]{.underline} of
[vital]{.underline} importance to the United States [that its defense
and security relationship with European countries, especially within
NATO]{.underline}, not only remains healthy but [is]{.underline}
correctly [oriented to]{.underline} current and likely future
[challenges.]{.underline} [Several things remain to be achieved if
Europe and]{.underline} the United [S]{.underline}tates in this regard.
[First, they must build a common approach]{.underline} not only [in
defense]{.underline}, but across [economic, information, and political
domains. Second, they must solve]{.underline} the continued [inequity in
burden sharing]{.underline} that hinders a stronger relationship between
them and erodes the confidence of many Americans in the efficacy of
NATO. [Third, it is necessary to achieve greater coherence]{.underline}
on NATO's eastern flank, particularly in the Black Sea region. [Fourth,
NATO must continue]{.underline} its efforts [to improve]{.underline} its
[deterrence capability against Russia's]{.underline} aggressive
[behavior]{.underline}. [The interests and responsibilities of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [are global]{.underline}, with
freedom of navigation on the seas and preservation of the global commons
being prime examples. Its allies and partners benefit from these
freedoms as well, [but]{.underline} these have [now come under
threat]{.underline}, most notably in the South China Sea and with
China's growing control over much of the infrastructure of the world,
particularly in Europe and Africa. [The threat from China is real and
growing, and if it materializes the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will need]{.underline} a strong, [cohesive
NATO]{.underline}, as well as other partnerships around the world to
maintain order and security in Europe's neighborhood, and perhaps even
beyond, while the majority of its forces and capabilities, particularly
air and naval ones, are operating in the Pacific theater. [The
stability, security, and economic prosperity of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [are directly linked to that of
Europe.]{.underline} The bulk of its global economic relationships are
in North America and the European Union, and the majority of its most
reliable allies and partners are in Europe. To give but one example, the
shared intelligence obtained from Europe is essential to the
implementation of the recently published U.S. National Defense Strategy.
In this context, it is of vital importance to the United States that its
defense and security relationship with European countries, especially
within NATO, not only remains healthy but is correctly oriented to
current and likely future challenges. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is committed to the stability and security of
Europe,]{.underline} as it has been for over 100 years ever since the
first U.S. soldiers arrived in France during World War I. This has been
demonstrated regardless of who has been in the White House and which
party-controlled Congress. [The American people have a special affinity
for Europe, and the economic prosperity of the United States depends on
the continent's security and stability. But they also
expect]{.underline} that their [European friends]{.underline} and allies
[will]{.underline} pick up their [share of the burden for collective
security]{.underline} so as [to help maintain order around the
globe]{.underline} and ensure that Europe remains whole, free, and at
peace.

#### NATO is key to US power projection- provides needed capabilities to counter Russia

Admiral **Stavridis' 18** (Admiral Stavridis (Ret.), a TIME Contributing
Editor, was the 16th Supreme Allied Commander at NATO and is Vice Chair,
Global Affairs at The Carlyle Group and Chair of the Board of the
Rockefeller Foundation. "Why NATO Is Essential For World Peace,
According to Its Former Commander", Time,
https://time.com/5564171/why-nato-is-essential-world-peace/

**To many who lived** [through the Cold War, the alliance may seem like
an obvious good deal.]{.underline} **By binding Europe's democracies
together,** [NATO decreased the chances of the brutal conflicts that
dominated the continent through the end of World War II]{.underline}**.
NATO** [provided a strong counterweight to Russia, and
communism]{.underline} **more broadly, helping defeat that ideology
virtually without firing a shot.** [And when the U.S. went to
war]{.underline} **in Afghanistan after 9/11,** [the NATO allies
went]{.underline} **with us in their first and only exercise of Article
5.** [But]{.underline} **the Cold War is long over, and** [new
challenges require clear thinking]{.underline}**, not nostalgia.
Originally conceived, as its first leader, Lord "Pug" Ismay, quipped,
"to keep the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down,"**
[what]{.underline} **exactly** [does NATO exist to do
now]{.underline}**? Its expansion to the tiny countries named above
raises legitimate questions of common purpose and shared values.**
[Russia is back and playing a much subtler role]{.underline} **in
undermining and threatening the organization. China's emergence as
America's most powerful global competitor makes NATO seem anachronistic.
Is the alliance, as President Donald Trump called it, "obsolete"? It was
the avowed NATO hater Vladimir Putin, ironically, who revitalized the
alliance and launched NATO 3.0. Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008 and
Ukraine in 2014 gave new purpose to NATO. I vividly remember attending
an alliance meeting shortly after I took command in 2009 during which
Chiefs of Defense of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania laid out a
passionate, intelligence-based briefing on the possibility of Russian
intervention in the Baltic countries. I assessed it to be a very low
probability at that moment, but in the years afterward, I became
increasingly concerned. We** [updated]{.underline} **our** [NATO
defensive war plans, conducted significant training exercises and
requested additional forces across the organization]{.underline} **to
maintain a higher level of readiness. Putin's subsequent actions,
including the shooting down of a Malaysia Airlines jet over Ukraine and
increased aggression in the air and on the high seas around NATO's
periphery, drew the alliance together. But** [even as NATO reawakened,
the challenge from outside was changing.]{.underline}
[Putin]{.underline} **has** [practiced "hybrid warfare"]{.underline}
**against his neighbors, the would-be NATO members Georgia and Ukraine.
A lethal mixture of propaganda, social-network manipulation,
cyberoperations, special forces and unconventional terrorist-like
attacks poses a different kind of threat than the tanks and missiles of
the Cold War.** [Could Russia make a similar set of moves on a NATO
ally?]{.underline} **It is smart. U.S. and European** [defense
innovation and production provides a formidable military research and
development capacity.]{.underline} **Particularly in cybersecurity,
unmanned vehicles, space operations, special-forces technologies,
maritime and anti-submarine capability, and air and missile defense,**
[NATO is a technology and education superpower.]{.underline} **It is
capable.** [The alliance boasts a large command structure of highly
qualified teams of military officers]{.underline} **from all of the 29
nations. Throughout Europe and the East Coast of the U.S.,** [those
teams prepare war plans, conduct]{.underline} **training** [exercises,
monitor readiness]{.underline} **of allied units,** [gather
intelligence]{.underline} **about potential adversaries** [and run
complex operations]{.underline} **centers that cover the entire
geographic range of NATO. These standing staffs, which we rationalized
by reducing them 35% while I was** [NATO]{.underline} **commander,**
[can conduct]{.underline} **prompt** [and]{.underline} **sustained**
[combat operations]{.underline} **in a coalition structure on short
notice. Should we be prepared to fight and die in a NATO campaign? Yes.
On balance,** [the alliance]{.underline} **still** [provides strategic
benefit to the U.S.]{.underline} [We should support]{.underline} **this
venerable organization,** [encourage]{.underline} **our allies to
increase their defense spending** [and push them to operate with us on
key challenges.]{.underline} **We should demand that they help us build
a NATO 4.0 that is even more fit for the decades ahead.**

### Hegemony Good Impact

#### Primacy prevents [great-power conflict]{.underline} --- multipolar revisionism [fragments]{.underline} the [global order]{.underline} and causes [nuclear war]{.underline}.

Advanced International Studies. Charles Edel; PhD, Senior Fellow and
Visiting Scholar at the United States Studies Centre at the University
of Sydney. ("The Lessons of Tragedy: Statecraft and World Order;" Ch. 6:
Darkening Horizon; Published by *Yale University Press*; //GrRv)

Each of these geopolitical challenges is different, and each reflects
the distinctive interests, ambitions, and history of the country
undertaking it. Yet [there is **growing cooperation** between the
countries that are **challenging** the **regional pillars of the
U.S.-led order.** **Russia** and **China** have **collaborated**
on]{.underline} issues such as energy, sales and development of
**[military technology]{.underline}**, opposition to additional U.S.
military deployments on the Korean peninsula, and naval exercises from
the South China Sea to the Baltic. In Syria, [Iran provided the **shock
troops** that helped keep Russia's ally]{.underline}, Bashar [al-Assad,
in power]{.underline}, as Moscow provided the air power and the
diplomatic cover. "[Our **cooperation** can **isolate
America**]{.underline}," supreme leader Ali Khamenei told Putin in 2017.
More broadly, [what links these challenges together is their
**opposition** to the constellation of **power, norms, and
relationships** that the U.S.-led order entails, and in their propensity
to use **violence**]{.underline}, coercion, and intimidation [as means
of making that opposition **effective**]{.underline}. Taken
collectively, [these challenges constitute a **geopolitical sea
change**]{.underline} from the post-Cold War era.¶ [The revival of
**great-power competition** entails]{.underline} higher international
tensions than the world has known for decades, and the revival of
[**arms races, security dilemmas**, and **other artifacts** of a more
**dangerous past**. It entails **sharper conflicts** over the
international rules]{.underline} of the road on issues ranging from
freedom of navigation to the illegitimacy of altering borders by force,
[and **intensifying competitions** over states that reside at the
intersection of rival powers' **areas of interest**]{.underline}. It
requires confronting the prospect that [**rival powers** could
**overturn** the **favorable regional balances** that have
**underpinned** the U.S.-led order for decades, and that they might
construct **rival spheres of influence**]{.underline} from which America
and the liberal ideas it has long promoted would be excluded. Finally,
it necessitates recognizing that [great-power rivalry could lead to
**great-power war**]{.underline}, a prospect that seemed to have
followed the Soviet empire onto the ash heap of history.¶ Both
[**Beijing** and **Moscow** are]{.underline}, after all, [**optimizing
their forces** and **exercising aggressively** in preparation for
potential **conflicts** with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and its allies; [Russian doctrine explicitly
emphasizes the]{.underline} limited [use of **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} to achieve escalation dominance in a war with
Washington. In Syria, [U.S. and Russian forces even came into **deadly
contact**]{.underline} in early 2018. American airpower decimated a
contingent of government-sponsored Russian mercenaries that was
attacking a base at which U.S. troops were present, an incident
demonstrating the increasing boldness of Russian operations and the
corresponding potential for escalation. [The world]{.underline} has not
yet returned to the epic clashes for global dominance that characterized
the twentieth century, but it [has returned to the **historical norm**
of **great-power struggle**]{.underline}, with all the associated
dangers.¶ Those dangers may be even greater than most observers
appreciate, because if today's great-power competitions are still most
intense at the regional level, who is to say where these competitions
will end? By all appearances, [Russia **does not simply want to be** a
"**regional power**"]{.underline} (as Obama cuttingly described it) that
dominates South Ossetia and Crimea.37 [It **aspires** to the **deep
European** and **extra-regional impact** that **previous incarnations**
of the Russian state enjoyed]{.underline}. Why else would Putin boast
about how far his troops can drive into Eastern Europe? [**Why else**
would Moscow]{.underline} be **[deploy]{.underline}**ing military power
[into the **Middle East?**]{.underline} [**Why else** would it be
continuing to cultivate]{.underline} intelligence and [**military
relationships** in regions as remote as **Latin America?¶**]{.underline}
Likewise, [China is **today** focused primarily on securing its own
**geopolitical neighborhood**, but its ambitions for **tomorrow** are
**clearly much bolder.**]{.underline} Beijing probably does not envision
itself fully overthrowing the international order, simply because it has
profited far too much from the U.S.-anchored global economy. Yet [China
has nonetheless positioned itself for a **global challenge** to **U.S.
influence**]{.underline}. [Chinese military forces are deploying **ever
farther** from China's immediate periphery; Beijing has **projected
power** into the **Arctic** and **established bases** and **logistical
points** in the **Indian Ocean** and **Horn of Africa**]{.underline}.
Popular Chinese movies depict Beijing replacing Washington as the
dominant actor in sub-Saharan Africa---a fictional representation of a
real-life effort long under way. [The **Belt and Road Initiative**
bespeaks an aspiration to **link** China to countries throughout
**Central Asia, the Middle East, and Europe**]{.underline}; BRI, AIIB,
and RCEP look like the beginning of an alternative institutional
architecture to rival Washington's. In 2017, [Xi]{.underline} Jinping
[told the]{.underline} [Nineteenth National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party that Beijing could]{.underline} now "**[take center
stage in the world]{.underline}**" [and act as an **alternative** to
**U.S. leadership**]{.underline}.38¶ These ambitions may or may not be
realistic. But they demonstrate just how significantly the world's
leading authoritarian powers desire to shift the global environment over
time. The **[revisionism]{.underline}** we are seeing today [may
therefore be **only the beginning**]{.underline}. As [China's power
**continues to grow,** or if it is successful in **dominating the
Western Pacific**, it will **surely move on** to **grander
endeavors**]{.underline}. If Russia reconsolidates control over the
former Soviet space, it may seek to bring parts of the former Warsaw
Pact to heel. Historically, [this has been a recurring pattern of
**great-power behavior**---interests **expand with power**, the appetite
**grows** with the eating, **risk-taking** increases as **early
gambles** are seen to **pay off**]{.underline}.39 This pattern is
precisely why the revival of great-power competition is so
concerning---because [**geopolitical revisionism** by **unsatisfied
major powers** has so often presaged **intensifying international
conflict**,]{.underline} confrontation, [and]{.underline} even
**[war]{.underline}**. The great-power behavior occurring today
represents the warning light flashing on the dashboard. It tells us
there may be still-greater traumas to come.¶ The threats today are
compelling and urgent, and there may someday come a time when the
balance of power has shifted so markedly that the postwar international
system cannot be sustained. Yet that moment of failure has not yet
arrived, and so the goal of U.S. strategy should be not to hasten it by
giving up prematurely, but to push it off as far into the future as
possible. Rather [than simply **acquiescing**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} the **[decline]{.underline}** of a world it spent
generations building, [America should **aggressively bolster its
defenses**, with an eye to **preserving** and perhaps even selectively
**advancing** its remarkable achievements.]{.underline}

#### Military primacy solves [economic growth]{.underline}, [prolif]{.underline}, and [great-power war]{.underline}.

As William Wohlforth has noted, **[American primacy]{.underline}** and
activism [acted as a **powerful deterrent to great-power conflict** by
creating **enormous disincentives** for Russia, China, or other actors
to incur the "focused enmity" of the **United States**]{.underline}.11
The persistence and even extension of [the U.S. security blanket
**smothered potential instability** in]{.underline} unsettled [regions
such as **Eastern Europe**, while removing any possibility
of]{.underline} German or Japanese **[revanchism]{.underline}**---a
prospect much feared in the early 1990s---[by keeping]{.underline} those
[countries]{.underline} **[tightly lashed]{.underline}** [to
Washington]{.underline}. [American intervention helped **extinguish
bloody conflicts** in the **Balkans**]{.underline} before they could
spread to neighboring countries; [U.S.]{.underline} diplomatic and
**[military pressure]{.underline}** [kept **aggressive tyrannies** such
as **Iraq, Iran**, and **North Korea bottled up a**nd helped **slow the
spread** of **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. U.S. support helped
democratic forces triumph in countries from Haiti to Poland, as the
number of democracies rose from 76 in 1990 to 120 in 2000;

### At: NATO Deterrence Fails-Underfunding

#### NATO deterrence solves- no signs of underfunding

[The invasion of Ukraine by Russia has highlighted]{.underline} more
than ever [the importance of NATO]{.underline}'s existence and has
undoubtedly forced Western leaders, especially European ones, to deal
with their relations with Moscow and the question of the common defense.
The conclusions of Thursday's NATO summit, in the same week that the
leaders of the Group of Seven Industrialized Nations held their meeting
in Germany, mark a clear turning point: the post-Cold War era is over
and Russia is no more the strategic partner of the Alliance[. Deterrence
takes center stage at this summit.]{.underline} The first signs were
already born after the invasion of Crimea from Russia, but the decisions
of the summit reinforce it more. Four are the most important
announcements: the goal of increasing the number of NATO forces on
alert, the first permanent American base on the eastern flank of the
Alliance, the formal invitation to Finland and Sweden to join NATO and a
new guiding strategy of ten years that abandoned the idea of
collaboration with Moscow. [NATO is committed to increasing the number
of rapidly deployable troops to ensure rapid defense for each of the
potentially threatened countries. A planned increase to 300,000 soldiers
trained and prepared to respond to an attack within 30
days]{.underline}, whose military commanders would have detailed plans
to defend against attacks on specific territories with specific troops
and weapons. [The United States said it would send another 5,000 troops
to Romania and the UK and another 1,000 to Estonia.]{.underline} By
doing so, [the US would not violate the 1997 agreement between NATO and
Russia not to permanently station new combat forces on the territory of
the former communist bloc countries]{.underline}. For this reason, the
US and allied deployments in Romania and the Baltic States will be in
rotation and not permanent. A new US Army Corps headquarters permanently
stationed in Poland will support the effort once NATO has gathered
enough troops from its allies. The Polish base is important because it
will provide permanent planning, training and command capabilities for
the 300,000 high-alert forces. [The United States is deploying two extra
destroyers]{.underline} at their naval base in Rota, southern Spain, [to
strengthen their presence in the Mediterranean, and two F-35 fighter
squadrons in the United Kingdom, where they will be designated for
patrolling northern Europe for defense and deterrence
purpose.]{.underline} The announcement of the increase in US forces
could lead to the highest number of American presence since the
post-Cold war, reaching 120,000 soldiers. The peak during the Cold War
was around 300,000 soldiers.

### N/U- Tech Focus Now

#### Non unique- NATO is already expanding its strategy to focus on emerging technology

Managing Editor of DefenseScoop, NATO unveils new Strategic Concept,
pledges support for new 'defense innovation accelerator'; FedScoop;
https://www.fedscoop.com/nato-unveils-strategic-concept-pledges-support-for-new-defense-innovation-accelerator/

[NATO released its new Strategic Concept]{.underline} on Wednesday, and
leaders are expected to offer pledges to establish a new "Defense
Innovation Accelerator" for the North Atlantic.¶ **[The need for more
focus and investment in emerging technology is a major
theme]{.underline}** of this week's NATO Summit in Madrid, which
President Biden is attending along with his European counterparts.¶ [The
innovation accelerator "will support NATO's efforts to boost
interoperability]{.underline} [and ensure that every Ally has access to
cutting-edge technological solutions]{.underline} for military needs,"
according to a White House fact sheet released Wednesday.¶ The United
States will contribute to the initiative by facilitating access to U.S.
test centers and other technology "accelerator sites" in the "extensive
and diverse U.S. innovation sector," it said.¶ [The military alliance is
also launching a new innovation fund]{.underline} that will invest 1
billion Euros in startups and other organizations developing "dual-use"
emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday during a press conference.¶
Together with the new innovation accelerator, the fund will help the
alliance "harness the best new technology for transatlantic security,"
he said.¶ NATO's new Strategic Concept, released Wednesday, states:
"[Emerging and disruptive technologies]{.underline} bring both
opportunities and risks. They [are altering the character of
conflict]{.underline}, acquiring greater strategic importance [and
becoming key arenas of global competition. Technological primacy
increasingly influences success on the battlefield]{.underline}."

### N/U- Cyber Focus

[Plans also call for enhancing cybersecurity]{.underline}.¶ "**[Building
on last year's adoption of a new Cyber Defense Policy for NATO, Allied
leaders will endorse a new action plan to strengthen cyber
cooperation]{.underline}** across the political, military, and technical
levels," the White House said. "As an operational domain for NATO,
**[cyber will also be a key component of NATO's strengthened deterrence
and defense posture]{.underline}**. Building on lessons learned from the
conflict in Ukraine, [Allies will decide at the Summit to use NATO as a
coordination platform for offering national assets to build and exercise
a virtual rapid response cyber capability]{.underline} to respond to a
serious cyber-attack. The United States will offer robust national
capabilities as part of this support network."¶ Cyberspace is now
"contested at all times," the Strategic Concept stated.¶ "Malign actors
seek to degrade our critical infrastructure, interfere with our
government services, extract intelligence, steal intellectual property
and impede our military activities," it said. [The alliance intends to
expedite its "digital transformation," adapt the NATO Command Structure
for the "information age" and enhance its cyber defenses]{.underline},
networks and infrastructure.¶ "[We will work together to adopt and
integrate new technologies]{.underline}, cooperate with the private
sector, protect our innovation ecosystems, shape standards and commit to
principles of responsible use that reflect our democratic values and
human rights," the document said.¶ The new Strategic Concept --- the
first update in more than a decade --- also focuses on space as a key
technology area and warfighting domain.¶ "[We will enhance our ability
to operate effectively in space and cyberspace to prevent]{.underline},
detect, counter and respond to the full spectrum of
[threats]{.underline}, using all available tools," it said, noting that
"a single or cumulative set of malicious cyber activities; or hostile
operations to, from, or within space; could reach the level of armed
attack and could lead the North Atlantic Council to invoke Article 5 of
the North Atlantic Treaty" and trigger collective defense responses that
could include armed conflict.¶ [The alliance also intends to boost the
resilience of its space and cyber capabilities which are at risk of
being attacked]{.underline}.

### N/U- Greece/Turkey Disputes

#### Nonunique- NATO currently divided over Turkey conflict 

#### Daily Sabah '22 (Staff written, "NATO urges Turkey, Greece to resolve disagreements over Aegean," Daily Sabah, 2022.06.15, <https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/nato-urges-turkey-greece-to-resolve-disagreements-over-aegean)-> HL 

[NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday urged Turkey and
Greece to resolve their disagreements over the Aegean Sea, where the two
are at loggerheads over islands and airspace.]{.underline} \"Diverse
views and debate are an essential part of our democracies,\" the head of
the trans-Atlantic military alliance told Greek news agency ANA. But, he
said, \"we urge Greece and Turkey to solve their differences in the
Aegean in a spirit of trust and Allied solidarity.\" \"That means
restraint and moderation, and refraining from any actions or rhetoric
that could escalate the situation.\" Stoltenberg\'s comments came two
weeks after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan declared Turkey would no
longer participate in regular high-level meetings with Greek leaders
intended to foster cooperation between the two countries. [Erdoğan
raised the stakes last week, warning Greece to demilitarize its Aegean
islands and saying he was "not joking."]{.underline} He spoke during
Turkish wargames near the Greek islands that included an amphibious
landing scenario. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis responded
that he would not engage in a \"ping-pong\" of personal insults with
Erdoğan. [The two NATO allies have long been at odds over a number of
issues including offshore rights, ownership of uninhabited islets,
competing claims over jurisdiction in the Eastern Mediterranean,
overlapping claims over their continental shelves, maritime boundaries,
airspace, energy, the ethnically split island of Cyprus, the status of
the islands in the Aegean Sea and migrants]{.underline}. [They have come
close to war three times in the past half-century,]{.underline} while
NATO stepped in when a dispute over drilling rights for potential oil
and gas deposits in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea led to a tense naval
standoff in the summer of 2020. [Turkey says Greece is stationing troops
on islands in the Aegean in violation of peace treaties signed after the
World Wars, demanding that Greece demilitarize its eastern islands,
citing the 20th-century treaties that ceded sovereignty of the islands
to Greece]{.underline}. [Greece counters that the islands need defenses
given threats of war from Turkey, which has NATO\'s second-biggest
military and maintains a large landing fleet on its Aegean
coast.]{.underline} [Turkey in recent months has stepped up criticism of
Greece stationing troops on islands in the eastern Aegean, near the
Turkish coast and in many cases visible from shore.]{.underline} These
islands were required to be demilitarized under the 1923 Treaty of
Lausanne and the 1947 Treaty of Paris, so any troops or weapons on the
islands are strictly forbidden. Starting with the Treaty of London in
1913, the militarization of the eastern Aegean islands was restricted
and their demilitarized status was confirmed with the signing of the
Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. The Lausanne pact established a political
balance between the two countries by harmonizing vital interests,
including those in the Aegean. The 1947 Treaty of Paris, which ceded the
Dodecanese islands from Italy to Greece, also confirmed their
demilitarized status. However, Greece argues that the 1936 Montreux
Convention on the Turkish Straits should be applied in this case, while
Ankara says Greece's obligation to disarm the islands remains unchanged
under the Montreux Convention, highlighting that there is no provision
that differentiates it from the Treaty of Lausanne on the issue.

The West, however, must deal with Putin as he is. He has legitimate

devalued diplomacy out of ignorance and hubris, which undermines
national security and NATO]{.underline}. [NATO and EU expansions were
good ideas, but were **uncoordinated,** and **poorly developed** and
**executed**]{.underline}. Abandoning most arms control, which benefited
American-Russian mutual security, was a major mistake, leaving our
European allies to face Putin\'s missile threats. None of those,
however, justifies Putin\'s war in Ukraine. Putin\'s unilateral,
military threats fundamentally challenges the post-Cold War order, not
just in Ukraine. [The West\'s biggest mistake,]{.underline} however[,
was **failure to maintain a credible NATO** deterrent posture in
Europe]{.underline}. [European nations allowed their military
capabilities to deteriorate;]{.underline} some became
impotent[.]{.underline} The Alliance was blind and unresponsive to
leadership and policy changes in Moscow over two decades. Putin is not

its East Central European members even after the 2014 annexation of
Crimea and take-over of part of the Donbas. [These errors make NATO

summit; Atlantic Council;
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/blinken-nato-is-more-united-more-focused-after-historic-summit/

On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken pushed for world
leaders to continue sustained action---in supporting Ukraine, in
pressuring Russia, and in reinforcing NATO on the heels of its historic
decision to invite Finland and Sweden to join the defensive alliance. ¶
"[NATO is emerging from this summit more united]{.underline}, more
focused, and with more assets [to deal with a multiplicity of
challenges,]{.underline}" Blinken said, praising the solidarity shown in
this week's gathering in Madrid. ¶ [The conversations at the two-day
NATO Public Forum]{.underline}, taking place on the sidelines of the
Madrid summit, [brought together a number of global leaders]{.underline}
in person and virtually, including US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who
reaffirmed US support for Article 5, the principle of collective
defense, as "ironclad." ¶ "This alarming challenge to national
sovereignty must be met by a unified global commitment to peace and
security," Pelosi said of Russian aggression, while also calling for
action to defend against China through continued "cooperation with our
Asia-Pacific partners to bolster cybersecurity, counter disinformation,
and preserve our collective defense." ¶ This week, [NATO nations agreed
on a new Strategic Concept that declares the Alliance's priorities in
staving off]{.underline} military and economic [threats from Russia and
China]{.underline}, reasserting shared democratic values and
human-rights protections, **[and battling new threats from the realms of
cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.]{.underline}**¶ "[All of
these things are challenges we have to meet and face]{.underline},"
Blinken said, "**[but we know that we're going to be more effective in
doing it if we actually have a shared, common approach."]{.underline}**

President-Elect Joe [Biden]{.underline}'s transition team [has declared

must take on cybersecurity threats as one of its key priorities.
[Nowhere will that effort be more important than with]{.underline} the
United States' closest Allies at [NATO]{.underline}, a cornerstone for
Western security. Today, [NATO's security is threatened by Russia's and
China's continuous cyberattacks]{.underline} on the Alliance and its
members. **[To accomplish its mission of deterrence]{.underline}** and
defense, **[NATO needs to implement a strategy of proactive, continuous
responses to China and Russia in cyberspace]{.underline}**, where great
power competition is playing out in real time.¶ [Russia and China
challenge NATO and its members in cyberspace on a daily basis, as part
of ongoing hybrid campaigns to undermine the transatlantic
community]{.underline}. The Kremlin's actions have involved intrusions
into Allies' critical infrastructures, manipulating Allies' elections
through hacks and disinformation, and even blocking GPS information
critical to NATO activities. The Chinese government has engaged in cyber
espionage against Allies' military capabilities; intellectual property
theft related to sensitive technologies, industries, and infrastructure;
and disinformation against transatlantic countries, including around the
coronavirus. [These efforts to weaken NATO countries and Alliance
cohesion represent a persistent threat to Allied security.]{.underline}¶
[NATO has recognized the collective dangers of these hybrid attacks in
cyberspace. Up to this point, however, the Alliance has taken a reactive
approach]{.underline}, responding as if Russian and Chinese cyber
attacks are each isolated incidents. [But because Russian and Chinese
cyber efforts are part of continuous campaigns directed at the overall
capability of the Alliance, NATO's response has been
insufficient]{.underline}, failing to reduce or dissuade further
attacks. [To assure the security of its members going forward, NATO
needs its own continuous response campaign to these
threats.]{.underline}¶ President-elect Biden and his team have pledged
to renew [US]{.underline} leadership in [cooperation]{.underline} with
Allies and partners. That agenda [should start at NATO]{.underline},
**[and a key focus should be on cybersecurity]{.underline}**. In early
NATO meetings, the Biden administration should champion a cybersecurity
continuous-response campaign, built around three key actions.

DON'T LET RUSSIA DOMINATE THE STRATEGIC CONCEPT; War on the Rocks;
https://warontherocks.com/2022/06/dont-let-russia-dominate-the-strategic-concept/

When NATO members agree on a new Strategic Concept at their summit in
Madrid, Russia's invasion of Ukraine will dominate the discussion. But
with this existential crisis rightfully taking center stage, [other
threats have not gone away. The challenge for NATO is to situate
Russia's invasion in a wider strategic context, addressing other key
issues]{.underline} before they create new existential crises in the
future.¶ [What does this mean in practice?]{.underline} We contend that
despite the current centrality of the Russo-Ukrainian war,
[Sino-American rivalry is likely to drive U.S. national security
thinking in the coming decades. NATO's 2022 Strategic Concept should
address this]{.underline} reality. Among the many challenges in Asia and
the broader Indo-Pacific, China's designs on Taiwan figure most
prominently. China is watching the Russo-Ukrainian war closely, seeking
to draw strategic lessons. This dynamic need not be catastrophic for
European and trans-Atlantic security. It creates opportunities for
E.U.-NATO cooperation and greater European strategic autonomy (or
strategic responsibility) in the context of an enduring trans-Atlantic
bond. Europe and Asia are increasingly linked as two theaters in a
global system hinging on the United States and anchored in its alliances
in both regions. The strategic concept should thus lay out a vision for
how NATO can simultaneously compete with both China and Russia.¶
**[There are also several specific threats and challenges]{.underline}**
that [the]{.underline} 2022 [Strategic Concept should
address.]{.underline} First, **[allies should tackle the effects of
emerging and emerged disruptive technologies on]{.underline}**
strategic, defense, and force **[planning]{.underline}**. Second,
[adversaries are increasingly using high- and low-tech approaches short
of armed conflict to disrupt national politics]{.underline} and daily
life in Western democracies. **[Enhancing and coordinating resilience
across the alliance should be a goal of the strategic
concept]{.underline}**. Third, money remains the sinew of war. Whether
it is investment in national and common-funded capabilities, or
transfers to partners like Ukraine, ample and efficient spending is a
requirement for a successful strategy. Fourth, NATO should continue to
grapple with the distinct but related challenges of terrorism and
irregular warfare.

DON'T LET RUSSIA DOMINATE THE STRATEGIC CONCEPT; War on the Rocks;
https://warontherocks.com/2022/06/dont-let-russia-dominate-the-strategic-concept/

[A significant strategic concern for NATO allies is to avoid
precipitating a Russian-Chinese authoritarian alignment.]{.underline}
While Russia and China face distinct strategic challenges of their own
and their "unlimited partnership" has appeared to stumble upon some
limits, [their continued pursuit of emerging]{.underline}, disruptive
[technologies]{.underline} and their authoritarian models of governance
[present significant risks to NATO allies. These models]{.underline},
coupled with Russia and China's shared willingness to undermine national
and international institutions in the trans-Atlantic community, [mean
that the most daunting threat NATO faces may be to its foundational
values.]{.underline} Incorporating these core values into strategy and
policy will be a key task for the 2022 Strategic Concept.¶ New Domains¶
Whether in coordination or not, [China and Russia will undoubtedly
continue to challenge allies in domains like space and cyber using
emerging]{.underline} and emerged [technologies]{.underline}. **[Dealing
with such challenges is core NATO business]{.underline}** --- grounded
in Article 3 of the Washington Treaty and resting primarily with
national authorities. **[The new Strategic Concept should aim to
integrate these relatively new domains]{.underline}** while responding
to disruptive technologies as well. [Allies must endeavor to reach a
"pre-crisis" consensus on what space and cyber actions would constitute
an "armed attack"]{.underline} in accordance with Article 5. **[This
kind of crisis decision-making is a core function of
NATO']{.underline}**s political and military headquarters. **[Such
agreement, when paired with improved national capabilities, would
contribute to deterrence by communicating resolve to
adversaries]{.underline}**. Improved capabilities themselves will only
arise through public-private partnership to maintain a technological
edge. [A common strategic culture of innovation]{.underline}, much of
which arises from the private sector, [is a key advantage that NATO
has]{.underline} --- and should retain --- [over its
adversaries]{.underline}. Such innovation has been on display in the
Russo-Ukrainian war and will doubtless be essential in future conflicts.

keep "our people safe", the [Alliance "must continue to **strengthen and
modernize** our **deterrence and defence**,"]{.underline} NATO
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at the Riga Summit on 30
November 2021. **[Innovation]{.underline}** plays a [**critical** role
in modernizing]{.underline} armed forces amid a complex strategic
environment. To this purpose, Stoltenberg unveiled the Defence
Innovation Accelerator for the [North Atlantic]{.underline} (DIANA) on
22 October 2021. DIANA shall [bring **defence and commercial companies**
together with military users to develop novel solutions]{.underline}
that meet the needs of the future battlefield. He also launched the
[NATO Innovation Fund to invest up to €1bn to support innovators
**developing emerging technologies**.]{.underline} The announcement
comes at a time when the Alliance is working on a new Strategic Concept.
[**Innovation** will be **key to preserving NATO's edge**]{.underline},
as the Secretary-General pointed out in his 2030 food for thought paper.
Although NATO is a potent defence organization, [emphasis on emerging
technologies]{.underline} reveals its Achilles' heel. Artificial
intelligence, autonomy, biotechnology, quantum technology, and other
technologies are at the heart of geoeconomic competition. Geoeconomic
competition unfolds around the projection of economic power within and
across the domains of land, air, sea, space, and cyberspace to achieve
political goals. Today's geoeconomic dynamic defines winning business
models amid a growing dichotomy between market-driven and state-driven
nations. It aims to set the rules, principles, and standards that guide
economic activities and access to and ownership of emerging
technologies. [**NATO's** current **emphasis** on **emerging
technologies**]{.underline} with defence and commercial applications
risks making the Alliance subject to this new geoeconomic dynamic. This
dynamic [can undermine **NATO's innovation agenda**]{.underline} and
[endanger its **strategic edge**]{.underline}. Therefore, NATO needs to
respond. First, NATO needs to embrace the realities of economic security
seriously. This call flows logically from Article 2 of the North
Atlantic Treaty, encouraging allies' economic collaborations. In our
view, economic security combines national security and economic policy
with technology and innovation policy to identify economic disruptions.
It also prevents these disruptions from arising and strengthens a coping
capacity to deal with economic emergencies. Economic security requires
allies, for example, to engage on defence-critical standards, advancing
transparency for defence supply chains, and considering the interplay
between technology development, foreign direct investment, and export
control. Therefore, the new Strategic Concept should incorporate
economic security as an essential element. Second, economic security
requires NATO to shape mindsets about defence investments and
sustainability. Already today, defence companies face financial
challenges as banks cancel bank accounts or refrain from covering export
risks. The emphasis on environmental, social, and governance criteria
(ESG) that increasingly shapes and determines financial investments will
reinforce these problems as defence is considered toxic. But a narrow
interpretation of ESG that considers defence incompatible with the world
view underpinning ESG is detrimental to NATO's ambition to invest in
companies. It also means other investors will likely shy away from
investing in the same companies. Therefore, the Alliance needs to step
up activities with the European Commission, which works on a
classification system to identify ESG-compliant activities, to make
defence investments compatible. Third, business is the first line of
defence in a geoeconomic world, and NATO needs a platform to discuss
geoeconomics with business. Today, the [NATO Industry Forum is the
leading gathering to address defence industrial matters with defence
companies.]{.underline} However, the [emphasis on emerging
technologies]{.underline} underlines the [importance]{.underline} of
non-defence companies. Therefore, NATO should envisage a new special
format of the North Atlantic Council to meet with the NATO Industry
Forum members -- and possibly also the European Commission -- to allow
state and corporate leaders to jointly engage on the proposed economic
security agenda. Fourth, strategic-level public-private dialogue also
breathes new life into deepening cooperation with the private sector.
NATO should become an early adopter of the solutions developed with
allied money. Making NATO the launch customer sends important market
signals and provides companies with an initial track record confirming
the relevance of their solutions. In addition, the Alliance should step
up efforts to incorporate business into military operations. Logistics
companies already play a crucial role, and traditional defence
businesses provide frontline support. The next stage comes with closely
integrating digital companies to leverage their contribution. But for
non-defence companies to provide frontline support, NATO not only needs
the right mindset, but the Alliance also needs to think about incentives
such as covering personnel risks on overseas deployments. Finally,
NATO's ability to stimulate innovation and ensure economic security also
depends on how it does business. Critically, NATO needs to strive for a
mission and capabilities-based innovation portfolio that maximises the
value of allied money. NATO may take a page from the financial services
industry and use a real options approach to manage technological risk
and drive technology development. This approach prices technology
building blocks like financial options, advances risk mitigation, speeds
up technology adoption and gives force planners and developers more
leeway to maximise input and output. In addition, NATO should offer
strategic hedging solutions for defence critical raw materials by
combining corporate demand estimates with AI-based insights on financial
and raw material markets. This will facilitate optimal, company-tailored
hedging strategies to mitigate the corporate security of supply and
price risks. Overall, [**NATO's** relevance in the 21st century remains
**tackling defence challenges** in a new strategic environment,
increasingly **defined by emerging** and rapidly changing
**technologies** and the profoundly important role of the **private
sector**. To this purpose, **NATO has embraced innovation and emerging
technologies**]{.underline}. This step, however, makes NATO subject to a
new geoeconomic dynamic that unfolds around competition for standards,
business models, technologies, and supply chains. This requires NATO to
make economic security a core element of its new Strategic Concept to
ensure NATO's edge. In turn, this will provide a sound basis for
expanded cooperation with the European Union, and make NATO an esteemed
partner of the new Transatlantic Trade and Technology Council, the new
body set up to enhance the EU-U.S. technology, economic, and trade
partnership.

### NATO Deterrence Fails- Underfunded

#### No NATO Deterrence- underfunding

**Franklin D. Kramer and Barry Pavel** June 13, 20**22** \[Distinguished
Fellow Board Director Former Assistant Secretary of Defense for
International Security Affairs; Senior Vice President and Director
Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security; NATO priorities: Initial
lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war; Atlantic Council;\]

As a starting point, it is important to recognize that [almost all NATO
nations]{.underline}, other than the United States,
[have]{.underline}---in the words of a recent European Union (EU)
analysis---[had "years of defence underspending, which has led
to]{.underline} an accumulation of [gaps and shortfalls in]{.underline}
the collective [military" capabilities]{.underline}.1 Most importantly
in the context of the current environment, the "capacity to operate
full-spectrum and at high intensity was neglected."2 That neglect, and
the concomitant need to focus on reestablishing the capacity for
high-intensity battle, is well recognized by NATO military leaders. For
example, France's "Strategic Vision of the Chief of Defense Staff"
specifically sets forth the requirement to be able to "respond...in a
high-intensity conflict."3 Yet, as a recent RAND report stated: France's
capacity to sustain a high-end, conventional conflict nonetheless is
limited. [The French military]{.underline} might be able to accomplish
all its assigned missions at once, but it [lacks depth]{.underline},
meaning that [such demand]{.underline}ing operations [would quickly
exhaust both its human and material resources]{.underline}." [What is
true for France is similarly true for other European
militaries]{.underline}, including---perhaps most
importantly---[Germany]{.underline}, which [has suffered from years of
underspending and strategic neglect]{.underline}. In addition, while
operating at a different scale in terms of resources and reach, [the US
military itself is insufficiently prepared]{.underline}, in particular,
in terms of its munitions and supply inventories for a sustained,
high-intensity conflict. However, these deficiencies are entirely
remediable if appropriate measures are taken. The initial requirement
for success in high-intensity conflict is, of course, simply to have
sufficient weapons and support available. [The EU analysis includes the
need to "\[r\]eplenish stockpiles" among the "most urgent capability
gaps]{.underline}."4 Taking lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war, those
stockpiles should include anti-armor capabilities and man-portable and
medium-range air defenses, each of which adds to the maneuver capability
and lethality of ground units. Additionally, unmanned aerial vehicles
for both sensing and attack and long-range fires have proved to be key
battlefield weapons, and air defenses for rear areas are also critical.
Finally, inventories of precision-guided munitions for air forces need
to be substantially increased. All of the foregoing should be undertaken
in the context of a potential conflict that, as the Russia-Ukraine war
has demonstrated, can extend for multiple months---and perhaps even
years. So, inventories and replenishment capacities need to be
established with such a timeframe in mind. NATO should utilize the
defense planning process to set the necessary targets. There should be
no doubt, however, that [achieving the requisite level of capability
will require significant defense-budget increases, as the gap has been
very substantial.]{.underline} As the EU analysis states: [Had all
Member States spent 2% of their GDP on defence with 20% dedicated to
investment, since 2006 until 2020, this would have resulted in an
additional]{.underline} approximately [EUR 1,100 billion for
defence]{.underline}, of which [around EUR 270 billion on
investment."]{.underline} As that analysis makes clear[, just meeting
NATO's 2-percent defense-spending goal will not be sufficient to resolve
the substantial readiness and sustainment deficiencies in any reasonable
timeframe]{.underline}. To be sure, the 2-percent goal is important, but
NATO needs to establish an additional readiness/sustainment initiative
over a shorter period---perhaps three or four years---that would
substantially increase the readiness of national forces. The large
increases in Germany's investment budget provide a model for a budgetary
approach that should be undertaken by other countries. Germany has
promised to reach 2 percent annually, including by spending one hundred
billion euros over a four-year period on investment.5 Other countries
should follow the German approach and establish special
investment-funding streams focused on readiness and sustainability that
would be designed to resolve the shortfalls in a three-to-four-year
period. Along with the funding increases, and as an additional part of a
NATO readiness/sustainment effort, the Supreme Allied Commander for
Europe (SACEUR) should be given the task (and authority) to review and
report on the readiness of the forces that will be called upon in the
event of a contingency. A focused effort on readiness and
sustainability, generated through the defense-planning process and
overseen by the SACEUR, will significantly enhance NATO's deterrent and
defense posture.
