### At: Epistemology -- Case O/Ws

#### Epistemological critique may decrease our ability to know the future with certainty, but this only supports defaulting to any risk of impacts large in magnitude-these are more important than small structural factors

TYLER **COWEN** **in** **2006** The Epistemic Problem Does Not Refute
George Mason University Consequentialism Utilitas, Dec2006, Vol. 18
Issue 4, p383-399

**[The epistemic critique increases the plausibility of what I call
\'big event consequentialism\']{.underline}**. In this view, **[we
should pursue good consequences, but with special attention to
consequences that are very important ]{.underline}**and very good, or
correspondingly, very bad. **[This includes stopping the use of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**, saving children from
smallpox, **[making progress
against ]{.underline}**global **[poverty]{.underline}**, and maintaining
or spreading liberal democracy. **[Big events]{.underline}**, as I
define them, **[typically are of significant practical
importance, ]{.underline}**involve obvious moral issues, and their value
is not controversial to benevolent onlookers. In contrast, consider
\'small events\'. Preventing a broken leg for a single dog, however
meritorious an act, is a small event as I define the concept. Making
American families wealthier by another \$20 also would count as a small
event. **[We should not count small events for nothing, but epistemic
issues may well lower their importance in refiective
equilibrium]{.underline}**. Of course we do not need a strict dividing
line between big and small events, but rather we can think in terms of a
continuum. In some cases a large number of small benefits will sum up to
a big benefit, or equal the big benefit in importance. It then can be
argued that we should treat the large benefits and the small benefits on
a par. If we lift a different person out of poverty one billion times,
this is no less valuable than lifting one billion people out of poverty
all at once. Here two points are relevant. First, sometimes we are
facing a single choice in isolation from other choices, rather than
examining a rule or general principle of behavior**[. ]{.underline}**In
this case it does not matter whether or not the small benefits would, if
combined in larger numbers, sum up to a greater benefit. The small
benefits will not be combined in greater numbers, and we should still
upgrade the relative importance of larger benefits in our decision
calculus. Second, **[not all small benefits sum into equivalence with
larger benefits]{.underline}**. **[Sometimes one value has a lexical
relationship to (all ]{.underline}**or some) **[other
values]{.underline}**. For instance **[arguably a large number of canine
broken legs, even a very large number, do not sum in value to make a
civilization. It does not matter how many dogs and how many broken legs
enter the comparison]{.underline}**. In other words, civilization may be
a lexical value with respect to canine broken legs. And when lexical
elements are present, the mere cumulation of numbers of broken legs does
not trump the more significant value. Numerous value relationships have
been cited as lexical. A large number of slight headaches, no matter how
numerous, may not sum up in value to equal a smaller number of intensely
painful deaths or personal tortures.\" **[A very large number
of ]{.underline}**\'muzak and **[potato\' lives do not sum to overtake
the value of a sophisticated civilization]{.underline}**.\^\^ Rawls put
forward liberty and the difference principle as his lexical values for
all political comparisons.\^\^ For our purposes, we do not require a
very strict notion of lexicality for these designations to matter. A big
value need not be lexical against a (multiplied) smaller value at all
possible margins. Instead **[the big value need only be lexical across
the comparisons that arise under relevant policy
comparisons. ]{.underline}**Furthermore a big value need not be lexical
in absolute terms against all other smaller
values. **[We therefore receive further guidance as to which big events
are upgraded in the most robust fashion. The big values that receive the
most robust upgrading would be those values with some lexical
importance]{.underline}**, relative to possible comparisons against
other smaller values.\^\" To sum up these pointsz**[, critics
of consequentialism would like to establish something like the
following: \'We find it hard to predict consequences. Therefore
consequences do not matter very much]{.underline}**, **[relative
to ]{.underline}**other **[factors, such as deontology ]{.underline}**or
virtue ethics. **[We should abandon consequentialist morality.\' But so
far epistemic considerations have yet to produce a strong argument for
this view. The arguments support a different conclusion, namely
downgrading the importance of minor consequences, and upgrading the
importance of major consequences. The most robust major consequences are
those which carry values with some lexical properties]{.underline}**,
and cannot be replicated by a mere accumulation of many small benefits.

### At: Epistemology- Policy First

#### Evaluate the plan before epistemology -- knowledge is always contextual and fractured which means specificity is key -- focusing debate on abstract risk modeling is intellectual hubris.

\*ableism corrected In the end, [I prefer progress within paradigms
rather than war between]{.underline} paradigms, especially **[as the
latter would be inconclusive]{.underline}**. [The human condition is
precarious]{.underline}. **[This is still the age of thermonuclear
weapons.]{.underline}** Globalization continues to disrupt lives as
countries realign their economies on the basis of comparative advantage,
production chains are disaggregated and wrapped around the globe, and
financial crises in one country reverberate around the planet in
minutes. [Transnational terrorism threatens to turn otherwise local
disputes into global conflicts]{.underline}, and leave everyone
everywhere feeling unsafe. And all the while, [anthropomorphic change
transforms the global climate with potentially catastrophic
consequences.]{.underline} Under these circumstances, **[we as a society
need all the help we can get]{.underline}**. **[There is no monopoly on
knowledge]{.underline}**. [And]{.underline} there is **[no guarantee
that any one kind of knowledge generated and understood within any one
epistemology or ontology is always and everywhere more useful than
another.]{.underline}** [To assert otherwise is an act of **supreme
intellectual hubris.**]{.underline} This is not a plea to let a hundred,
a thousand, or ten thousand intellectual flowers bloom. Scholars working
in cloistered isolation are not likely to produce great insights,
especially when the social problems besetting us today are of such
magnitude. All knowledge must be disciplined. That is, knowledge must be
shared by and with others if it is to count as knowledge. Positivists
and post-positivists are each working hard to improve and clarify the
standards of knowledge within their respective paradigms. This is an
important turn for both, as it will facilitate progress within each even
as it raises barriers to exchange across approaches. So, if not a
thousand flowers, it is perhaps better for teams of scholars to tend a
small number of separate gardens, grow what they can best, and share
when possible with the others and, especially, the broader societies of
which they are part. Do not mourn the end of theory, if by theory we
mean the Great Debates in International Relations. Too often,
[the]{.underline} Great Debates and especially the [paradigm wars became
contests over **the truth status of assumptions**]{.underline}.
[Declarations that 'I am a realist' or pronouncements that 'As a
liberal, I predict ...' were statements of a near quasi-religious
faith]{.underline}, **[not conclusions that followed from a falsifiable
theory with stronger empirical support.]{.underline}** Likewise,
[assertions that positivism or post-positivism is a better approach to
understanding world politics are similarly \[misleading\]]{.underline}
blinding. [The Great Debates were]{.underline} too [often]{.underline}
[academic in the worst sense of that term.]{.underline} [Mid-level
theory flourished in the interstices of these debates for decades and
now]{.underline}, [with the waning of the paradigm wars, is coming into
**its own within the field**.]{.underline} I regard this as an entirely
positive development. [We may be witnessing]{.underline} [the demise of
a particular]{.underline} kind of **[grand theory]{.underline}**, [but
theory]{.underline} --- [in the plural]{.underline} --- lives. **[Long
may they reign.]{.underline}**

### At: Structural Violence First 

#### Structural violence framing is analytically useless -- can't distinguish war from other types of violence -- the move to conflate the two makes politics ineffective

**Thomas 11** (Claire, Professor of International Politics at Sheffield
University, "Why don't we talk about 'violence' in International
Relations?" *Review of Int'l Studies* 37 p. 1829-1831)

Much of [the attractiveness of this idea of structural violence is that
it broadens]{.underline} the remit of [security studies,]{.underline} or
of research into violence. Thus, economic issues and the damage done by
poverty and so on become just as important as the damage done by direct,
physical violence. Authors who work with the concept of structural
violence aim to highlight the hidden structures in order to work towards
their transformation.63 [The problem with this is that it is defining a
concept dependent on what we want to be able to study]{.underline}
within its remit. [A concept should not depend for its meaning on how we
want to study it, but rather on what the concept means]{.underline}. The
concept of structural violence is performing a similar role to the
debate about broadening the definition of security. Within the security
debate we are used to people posing the challenge of securitisation --
that people call something a security problem in order to make it sound
more urgent, more policy relevant and so on. One can pose the same
challenge to structural violence. Rather than having a clear academic
reason for stretching the concept of violence to incorporate other,
equally bad, social ills, the main reason proposed is that these [other
social ills cause as much or more damage than the damage caused by
violence]{.underline}. [This may well be the case, and these issues
should have urgent academic and policy attention]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, [re-defining a concept like violence to
incorporate these issues]{.underline} [in order to gain that attention
is a poor way of achieving this]{.underline}. [A clear argument that
states the reasons why wider social ills are more worthy of our
attention does not need the further argument that we should also call
them violence]{.underline}. So, by calling something violent, or
designating it as an issue of security, an author is claiming a certain
importance for the issue, escalating it up the policy agenda, and
allowing for extraordinary reactions. For example, by saying that
extremists use violence, one designates it as a significant and bad
problem, which allows an exceptional response of violence (called
military force) to counter it. The aim of calling something violence in
order to push it up the policy agenda, meaning it requires special,
urgent action, can also lead to dealing with these issues in a
different, exceptional way, outside the realm of 'ordinary' politics.
This may or may not be beneficial in dealing with the issue in question,
or for our politics in general.64 A [similar move]{.underline} is [made
by]{.underline} [Žižek]{.underline} [when he claims that alongside
subjective violence]{.underline} (direct, intentional violence), [there
is also objective violence,]{.underline} one form of which is [systemic
violence]{.underline} -- the damaging consequences of the 'normal'
functioning of the system. This systemic violence must be taken into
account, according to Žžiek, in order to make sense of subjective
violence.65 He argues that this systemic violence needs to be given
prominence, despite the urgency attributed to direct violence which
fights for our attention.66 Again, this argument is valid in that
systemic problems cause more suffering in the world than direct
violence. But there has to be a further reason to also call this
violence. After all, the argument can be made without the need to label
something as violence. One could argue that seeing as our concepts are
important because they change the way we think about the world, and
change the way we act in it, a definition of violence that incorporates
these other social ills would be valuable. However, broadening the
concept in this way also has the potential for being damaging. [If we
conceive of all these things as equally violent, in order to see them as
equally important, there is an implication that we are also going to
tackle the issues as problems of violence.]{.underline} [Issues of
**poverty** are not helpfully tackled in the **same way** as issues of
**direct violence.** The concept of structural violence is problematical
as it means that the definition of violence becomes linked to the result
of an act]{.underline} (or influence), [and not to the intention or
actual action of the actor.]{.underline} This illustrates a key
difference in the way violence is conceived: one way sees violence from
the perspective of the perpetrator, and sees it as intentional,
destructive force; the other way sees violence from the point of view of
the victim, and sees it as a form of violation.67 Bufacchi points out
that these two concepts of violence stem from the Latin roots of the
term. The root of the word violence is violentia, meaning a passionate
and uncontrolled force, but the meaning is often conflated with
'violation', from the Latin violare, meaning 'infringement'.68 Although
the definition of violence is partly contingent on the result of an act,
in that it requires that the intention is to physically harm the victim,
it is also necessary for that result to be a means to an end, not an end
in itself. Because the result of many different acts or situations is
physical harm or death (or unequal power or life chances), many things
become incorporated into the definition of violence if the concept of
intention is not used, and if the instrumental nature of violence is
ignored. Roberts goes some way to improving on the debate about
structural violence by pointing out that structures are created by
people, and thus structural violence can be prevented and does have
responsible actors. He also operationalises it by referring to specific
acts of structural violence, looking at avoidable civilian deaths. He
argues that his way of looking at human insecurity enables the analysis
of structures, institutions and human agency, but without the problems
caused by broadening the debate to include Galtung's concept of
realising full human psychosomatic potential.69 But this does not
prevent the problem that [structural violence still refers to anything
an author wants it to]{.underline}. Interestingly, many of Roberts'
choice of examples can be incorporated under the title of direct
violence in any case (they are preventable female deaths: infanticide,
maternal mortality, intimate killings (normal domestic murder, dowry
murders and 'honour' killings), lethal female genital mutilation; and
avoidable deaths in children under five).70 Some caution is needed in
this approach, however. It is easy to think of examples where violence
is not intentional, for example a natural disaster, or bombing an empty
building that accidentally harms someone nearby. We have already
recognised that the concept has fuzzy boundaries, and thus we can
recognise that some violence occurs naturally. [The point]{.underline}
here [is to discuss that violence which is most relevant for the study
of international politics]{.underline}. This is not the same as
accepting that everything that causes harm in some way can be captured
within the term violence. It is also not going so far as to say that
accidental acts of violence are not violence at all. Collateral damage
is still violent. The point of including the idea of intentionality in
the definition of violence is that it ensures the violence we are
discussing in international politics has an actor and does not end up
including indeterminate ideas like a state of violence. It does not just
happen on its own. It is also an action that is done with the intention
of harming, unlike acts such as a doctor causing some pain in order to
heal.

#### Prioritize war impacts

John **Horgan**, Director of the Center for Science Writings at the
Stevens Institute of Technology, 20**12**, The End of War, Chapter 5,
Kindle p. 1600-1659

Throughout this book, I've examined attempts by scholars to identify
factors especially conducive for peace. But [there seem to be no
conditions that, in and of themselves, inoculate a society against
militarism]{.underline}. Not small government nor big government. Not
democracy, socialism, capitalism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, nor
secularism. Not giving equal rights to women or minorities nor reducing
poverty. The contagion of war can infect any kind of society. ¶ Some
scholars, like the political scientist Joshua Goldstein, find this
conclusion dispiriting. Early in his career Goldstein investigated
economic theories of war, including those of Marx and Malthus. He
concluded that [war causes economic inequality and scarcity of resources
as much as it stems from them]{.underline}. Goldstein, a self-described
"pro-feminist," then set out to test whether macho, patriarchal
attitudes caused armed violence. He felt so strongly about this thesis
that he and his wife limited their son's exposure to violent media and
contact sports. ¶ But by the time he finished writing his 522-page book
War and Gender in 2001, Goldstein had rejected the thesis. He questioned
many of his initial assumptions about the causes of war. He never gave
credence to explanations involving innate male aggression---war breaks
out too sporadically for that---but he saw no clear-cut evidence for
non-biological factors either. "[War is not a product of capitalism,
imperialism, gender, innate aggression, or any other single cause,
although all of these influence wars' outbreaks and
outcomes]{.underline}," Goldstein writes. "[Rather, war has]{.underline}
in part [fueled and sustained these and other injustices]{.underline}."
He admits that all his research has left him "somewhat more pessimistic
about how quickly or easily war may end." ¶ But here is the upside of
this insight: if there are no conditions that in and of themselves
prevent war, there are none that make peace impossible, either. This is
the source of John Mueller's optimism, and mine. [If we want peace badly
enough, we can have it,]{.underline} no matter what kind of society we
live in. The choice is ours. And [once we have escaped from the shadow
of war, we will have more resources to devote to other problems that
plague us, like economic injustice, poor health, and environmental
destruction, which war often exacerbates.]{.underline} ¶ The Waorani,
whose abandonment of war led to increased trade and intermarriage, are a
case in point. So is Costa Rica. In 2010, this Central American country
was ranked number one out of 148 nations in a "World Database of
Happiness" compiled by Dutch sociologists, who gathered information on
the self-reported happiness of people around the world. Costa Rica also
received the highest score in another "happiness" survey, carried out by
an American think tank, that factored in the nation's impact on the
environment. The United States was ranked twentieth and 114th,
respectively, on the surveys. Instead of spending on arms, over the past
half century Costa Rica's government invested in education, as well as
healthcare, environmental conservation, and tourism, all of which helped
make the country more prosperous, healthy, and happy. [There is no
single way to peace, but peace is the way to solve many other
problems.]{.underline} ¶ The [research]{.underline} of Mueller,
Goldstein, Forsberg, and other scholars [yields one essential
lesson.]{.underline} [Those of us who want to make the world a better
place---more democratic, equitable, healthier, cleaner---should make
**abolishing the invention of war** our priority, because peace can help
bring about many of the other changes we seek**.**]{.underline} [This
formula turns on its head the old social activists' slogan: "If you want
peace, work for justice]{.underline}." I say instead, "**[If you want
justice, work for peace.]{.underline}**" [If you want less pollution,
more money for healthcare and education, an improved legal and political
system---work for peace]{.underline}.

### Alt Fails- Incremental Key

#### Refusing all U.S. engagement won't solve \-- you should prefer incremental reform that reduces U.S. imperialism while retaining beneficial presence

[Of the U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ation[s' 18]{.underline}
major [human rights treaties, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is party to 5, fewer than any other nation on
earth]{.underline}, except Bhutan (4), and tied with Malaysia, Myanmar,
and South Sudan, a country torn by warfare since its creation in 2011.
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is the only nation on
earth that has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the
Child.]{.underline} It is [the only country to have pulled out of the
Paris Climate Agreement. It is]{.underline} by many measures [a top
destroyer of the natural environment]{.underline}, yet has been a leader
in [sabotaging climate protection negotiations for decades. Seven
countries and the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [reached an
agreement on Iran and nuclear energy, but the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [uniquely withdrew.]{.underline} President Donald
[Trump is threatening to withdraw]{.underline}, and Congress is
threatening to allow it, [from critical nuclear disarmament treaties
reached by]{.underline} Ronald [Reagan and]{.underline} Mikhail
[Gorbachev.]{.underline}¶ [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[not only stands outside the I]{.underline}nternational
[C]{.underline}riminal [C]{.underline}ourt, [but]{.underline} openly
[threatens sanctions against it and]{.underline} against [nations that
support it. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [leads
opposition to democratization of the U]{.underline}nited
[N]{.underline}ations [and easily holds the record for use of the veto
in the Security Council]{.underline} during the past 50 years, [having
vetoed U.N. condemnation of South African apartheid, Israel's wars and
occupations, chemical and biological weapons, nuclear weapons
proliferation]{.underline} and first use and use against non-nuclear
nations, [U.S. wars in Nicaragua and Grenada and Panama, the U.S.
embargo on Cuba, Rwandan genocide, the deployment of weapons in
outerspace, etc.]{.underline}¶ Contrary to popular opinion, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is not a leading provider of
aid to the suffering of the world]{.underline}, not as a percentage of
gross national income or per capita or even as an absolute number of
dollars. Unlike other countries, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [counts as 40 percent of its so-called aid, weapons
for foreign militaries. Its aid]{.underline} as a whole [is directed
around its military goals, and its immigration policies have long been
shaped around skin color, and]{.underline} lately around [religion,
not]{.underline} around [human need]{.underline} --- except perhaps
inversely, focusing on locking up and building walls to punish the most
desperate.¶ Keeping the above context, discussed at greater length here,
in mind, let's add to it one other set of facts. [Unarmed civilian
protectors and nonviolent peaceworkers]{.underline} from groups like
Nonviolent Peaceforce [have been proving]{.underline} for many years
that [people can accomplish more without guns than with
them.]{.underline} Thorough [studies of violent and nonviolent
campaigns]{.underline} over the past century have well [established that
principally nonviolent efforts are more likely to succeed
and]{.underline} those successes virtually guaranteed to
[be]{.underline} far [longer lasting.]{.underline} A consensus has
developed even within military establishments that [much of what
militaries do is counterproductive]{.underline} on its own terms, so
much so that ["there is no military solution"]{.underline} has
practically become a required mantra to be pointlessly but accurately
repeated by those attempting military solutions. The tools of diplomacy,
cooperation, aid, nonviolent investment, the rule of law, skilled
conflict resolution, disarmament, and peaceful conversion have become
extremely well-developed and understood, if hardly ever thought of or
employed or widely communicated.¶ Now, keeping all of that in mind, does
anything strike you as odd about exclamations that withdrawing U.S.
troops from a war is a form of "isolationism"? Is there anything
peculiar about the scores of people steadily emailing me to condemn a
planned protest of NATO as, you guessed it, "isolationism"? Five years
ago, there was a debate over whether to bomb Syria flat, and those
opposed to doing so were accused of "isolationism." Now the idea of
pulling troops out of Syria or Afghanistan or ceasing to help bomb and
starve the people of Yemen is subjected to the same rhetorical assault.
That Trump promises to keep the occupation of Iraq going is understood
as reassuring "engagement with the world" by people who demanded an end
to the occupation of Iraq when George W. Bush was president, and who
pretended to celebrate its ending when Barack Obama pretended to end
it.¶ [This is simple-minded thinking in the extreme]{.underline},
notwithstanding its claims to be just the opposite. "I'm against war but
we can't be simplistic about it and just end one of them willy-nilly,
abandoning our allies." This is the type of language used to support
imperialism in [the great debate between isolationism and imperialism, a
debate wholly dependent on the ridiculous pretense that these two
choices constitute the full range of possible human behaviors.¶ A lot of
people no longer fall for such sophistry when it comes to]{.underline}
domestic [politics]{.underline}. "Should we ignore drug users or lock
them up?" The obvious answer of "No, we shouldn't do either of those
things," actually occurs to a good many people unprompted. "Should we
allow shoplifting or imprison shoplifters for the rest of their lives?"
This is a question so patently stupid that it will actually elicit from
some people asked it the creative response: "Why not end poverty
instead? It's not like we don't have plenty of money to do that!" But
what about this question: ["Should we keep the U.S. military engaged in
each of these wars or ignore and abandon and forget about and forsake
the people there?"]{.underline} Ah, now we have [a patently stupid
question]{.underline} that has been repeated so many, many times that
it's hard to hear the stupidity of it.¶ [Each year that a war gets worse
while continuing]{.underline} somehow fails to [constitute]{.underline}
outrageous [proof that it should not have been continued.]{.underline}
The past year of the war on Afghanistan has been one of the deadliest,
yet it is the fear that things might go badly after U.S. troops leave
that is supposed to concern us. And we are supposed to be powerless to
do anything about it other than increase the bombings or avert our eyes
to focus on blaming peaceniks. [Here's another idea]{.underline} that I
think has been proposed so infrequently in part because most people
either find it unthinkable or find it too obvious to bother saying:
[What if we were to try an approach of real anti-isolationism?¶ What if
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [were to sign]{.underline}
and [ratify and abide by]{.underline} the [major laws of the world,
support the world's systems of justice, cooperate in
disarmament]{.underline} (including the nuclear weapons ban treaty),
[collaborate on climate protection, provide humanitarian
aid]{.underline} on an unprecedented scale (albeit miniscule in
comparison with military spending), [jumpstart a reverse arms race,
democratize the U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations, [participate
in truth and reconciliation hearings, invest in unarmed peacekeeping,
cease arming and training brutal dictatorships, and actually back
democracy abroad]{.underline} and [by its own example?¶]{.underline} The
son of the last dictator the United States imposed on Iran is waiting
hopefully in Bethesda, Maryland, for the next U.S. overthrow of the
Iranian government, while Iran has not picked out a future King of
America. What if the United States ceased worrying about rogue nations
and focused on ceasing to be one?¶ But, you may object, [none of that
fantasy is going to happen this week]{.underline}, while meanwhile the
Kurds are going to be massacred without their U.S. military friends.
Back [here in the real world]{.underline}, in which [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and its allies
[are]{.underline} going to go on [flooding the Middle East with weapons
and using war as foreign policy]{.underline}, each war must be continued
until . . . well, until a fantasy becomes possible, or Jesus comes back
from wherever he's been, or the Democrats take the throne but don't act
like, you know, the Democrats have always acted, or something! Of
course, we all know what the something is going to be: climate collapse,
the Middle East becoming uninhabitable for humans, and extreme weather
disasters in much of the rest of the globe. And the response to this
shocking if completely predictable and predicted development will be
violence or nonviolence, depending on what we have been conditioned to
suppose is normal or "natural" or "inevitable."¶ Given that [what is at
stake here is human survival]{.underline}, given that the U.S.
presidency has been gradually endowed with imperial powers such that the
fate of thousands of people can be determined by a tweet, [are we really
obliged to limit our short-term thinking to (a) "support the troops" by
keeping them in a desert exchanging bullets with the locals, or (b)
"abandon" people? Why not demand of the U.S. government]{.underline}
and/or other nations purporting to care about humanity, [immediate
announcement of an end to the weapons trade]{.underline}, the [opening
of diplomatic talks with]{.underline} all [relevant parties, the
commencement of a major aid program]{.underline}, and support for a
major new program of unarmed peacekeeping through a coalition of the
decent or if possible through a United Nations in which the United
States foreswears the veto?¶ Such an alternative to the
imperialism-or-isolationism trap is no more difficult to think of or to
act on than treating drug addiction or crime or poverty as reason to
help people rather than to punish them. [The opposite of bombing people
is not ignoring them. The opposite of bombing people is embracing
them.]{.underline} By the standards of the U.S. communications
corporations Switzerland must be the most isolationist land because it
doesn't join in bombing anyone. The fact that it supports the rule of
law and global cooperation, and hosts gatherings of nations seeking to
work together is simply not relevant. How about in the new year at least
we try a little new thinking?

### Alt Fails- Realism

#### State-centric and realist analysis are inevitable- the alt can't effect other countries' beliefs- default to the aff's minimization of threats

**Agnew 2k15** (John, professor of geography at UCLA, The Geopolitics of
Knowledge About World Politics: A Case Study in U.S. Hegemony)

In fact, **[considerable energy in academic international relations
today in the United States and elsewhere focuses on the weaknesses of
the neorealist synthesis]{.underline}** even as the master's programs
continue to churn out would-be practitioners often oblivious to the
political and theoretical bases of the arcane debates among some of
their teachers (Long et al., 2005 ). The continuing, even revived,
appeal of the neorealist synthesis seems to lie in its ritual appeal to
U.S. centrality to world politics (the "necessary nation," "the lender
of last resort," etc.) and in the enhanced sense since the end of the
Cold War and after 9/11 of a dangerous and threatening world that must
be approached with trepidation and preparation for potential violent
reaction and intervention as mandated by realist thinking. Yet in
practice there is a massive gap between the predictions of such
theorizing and what actually goes into the making of U.S. (or any other)
foreign policy, much of which has to do with persisting geopolitical
orderings of the world and domestic interests and their relative
lobbying capacities (Hellmann, 2009 ; Oren, 2009 ). **[International
relations as a field around the world has followed largely in American
footsteps.]{.underline}** I can attest that my own introduction to it in
the late 1960s in Britain involved reading textbooks that came
overwhelmingly from the United States. Debate about the relative degrees
of theoretical "pluralism" in the United States and Britain suggests
that at least the modes of categorizing theories are somewhat less
hidebound in the latter than in the former and that in recent years at
least there has been something of a parting of the ways across the
Atlantic, with nonrealist views becoming much more widespread in British
universities than in their American counterparts (Schmidt, 2008 ; Smith,
2008 ). More recently and elsewhere around the world, **[U.S. theories,
particularly neorealism, have proved rather more pervasive and
persistent.]{.underline}** **[In Russia]{.underline}**, for example,
which one might not expect to be particularly congenial to U.S.
ideas**[, the main academic journal about world politics, Mehdunarodnyye
protsessy (International Trends), seems to adhere to ideas about
international anarchy, nation-state developmentalism, and systemic
constraints on state action that are remarkably similar to those
represented by U.S. neorealism.]{.underline}** Even the more liberal
currents, refl ecting on globalization and a less state-oriented world,
mainly cite U.S. sources (Tsygankov & Tsygankov, 2007 ). Perhaps this
tendency refl ects the lack of local alternatives following the demise
of offi cial Marxist conceptions, dependence on funding from Western
foundations, and a general disorientation following the collapse of the
Soviet Union. It does not, however, entail much by way of support for
U.S. foreign policy, only a similar theoretical logic in arriving in
this case at Russiancentered positions (Müller, 2008 ). The recent
revival of Eurasian geopolitical thinking perhaps is a harbinger of a
more Russian-centric mode of thinking as an alternative to imported
brands (Tsygankov & Tsygankov, 2004 ). Given the cumulative crisis of
the United States in world politics over the past two decades, one might
expect to see some emerging alternative theoretical visions emanating
from beyond U.S. shores. The so-called English School of international
relations, associated in particular with the idea of "international
society" but effectively realist in many respects, has recently
undergone a concerted revival as an alternative to U.S. theories. It has
certainly traveled well beyond Britain, even if with questionable
success (e.g., Waever, 1992 ; Wendt, 1999 ). Zhang ( 2003 ) has examined
how well it has traveled to China since Adam Roberts, one of its main
advocates, visited Beijing in 1991. Lacking in equivalently talented
entrepreneurs or salesmen and the institutionalized connections between
U.S. and Chinese universities, the English School has had limited infl
uence, according to Zhang, in comparison to the continuing dominance of
U.S. scholars. But most of the main works are also not available in
Chinese, and the major research institutes in China are run by people
trained in the United States. **[To a large extent, therefore, academic
Chinese knowledge of the "international" largely remains refracted
through intellectual lenses made in the United States]{.underline}**.
Within China, however, change is in the offing. Some Chinese academics
write explicitly about what they term "international relations theory
with Chinese characteristics" (Xinning, 2001 ). In other words, China
has become involved in developing something akin to what happened in the
United States in the 1940s and 1950s. What is this Chinese synthesis?
According to Xinning ( 2001 ), there are two variants, with the second
smaller but growing more quickly. The fi rst borrows the phrase "Chinese
characteristics" from Deng Xiaoping to indicate an international
relations theory that centers on China's need to protect its
sovereignty, engage in peaceful coexistence with other states, and use
Chinese language, thought, and expression. The second asserts a more
radically Chinese vision of the world with China's status at the center
of a surrounding system, Confucian "benevolent governance," the winning
of confl icts without resorting to war, and interests, not morality, as
the basis of interstate behavior. In Xinning's words: After the
Tiananmen Square incident of 1989, most social science disciplines
(especially political science, sociology, and journalism) suffered a
setback because of the government's campaign against the ideological
liberalism of Chinese scholars and the so-called peaceful evolution
initiated by the West. However, International Relations received a
different treatment. Theoretical studies on IR continued to develop.
**[The teaching of Western IR theories continued at key universities,
and academic exchanges with the West in IR studies became more active.
This was mainly because Chinese leaders worried more about China's
isolation from the outside world than a "peaceful
evolution]{.underline}**." (Xinning, 2001 , p. 62) More recently, as
Xinning makes clear, a new Chinese international relations is evolving
which combines a range of elements (also see Yang & Li, 2009 ). **[As in
the U.S. case, however, it is its connection to state policy that gives
it special status. As in so many other features of the relationship
between the United States and China, there is an almost mirror image in
assumptions between the theory imported from the United States and what
increasingly goes for "Chinese" international relations
theory.]{.underline}** Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose. In
brief compass, I have tried to illustrate one facet of the geography of
knowledge, what I have called the geopolitics of knowledge, in relation
to one body of thinking, so-called international relations theory. I
have emphasized its founding in the early postwar United States, its
travels around the world as a function of American hegemony, and the
story of two alternatives, the English School, to illustrate the limits
of pluralism, and the rise of an IR theory with "Chinese
characteristics," to show how an alternative with hegemonic potential
can begin to emerge. Who knows, particularly if this latter, as Callahan
( 2001 ) has said in direct response to Xinning's ( 2001 ) essay on
Chinese thinking about world politics, adjusts to the more globalized
and transnational world that has seemed, at least until recently, to be
in the offing, then we may actually end up with a theory of world
politics that avoids the inside--outside views of sovereignty and the
need for a single hegemonic power that so much of recent IR theory has
been devoted to normalizing (Agnew, 2009 ). Don't bet your house on it.
**[As long as we have global political hierarchy, we are likely to have
parallel "theories" of world politics which naturalize that state of
affairs.]{.underline}**

The problem is that Linklater argues by fiat rather than by the weight
of hard evidence, which is in scant supply here. Again and again,
radical propositions are supported by nothing more than references to
some other critical theorist who shares Linklater's vision and/or
tendency to rely on slippery, undefined and unmeasured concepts,
primarily globalisation and fragmentation. This simply will not do.
**[Whether Linklater, or Kant, or Marx, or Habermas, or other
contemporary critical, feminist, postmodern theorists believe that
something will happen]{.underline},** must happen, **c[an happen, and
should happen, does not make it so]{.underline}**---or likely to be
so---in the foreseeable future. Moreover, [**as a work of critical
political theory, it is neither very critical nor very political**. **To
believe, for instance, that the goals of the triple transformation will
be advanced by wider dialogic relations, one must naively assume not
only that there is an underlying global harmony of interests from which
a consensus can be forged on important political and social issues, but
that such 'agreements will not be reached by ignoring or suppressing
marginal and dissident voices'**]{.underline} (p. 41). In this view as
in others, **L[inklater simply skates over the central
rationalist-realist explanations for international conflict and the
struggle for power and security, e.g., states have an incentive to
misrepresent private information about their capabilities and
resolve]{.underline}**, and they may be unable to commit credibly to
uphold bargains that they would mutually prefer to war;1 the nature of
many international disputes are indivisible and therefore do not admit
compromise; states exist under conditions of material and social
scarcity with no sovereign arbiter to settle and enforce distributional
disputes. [**As long as things commonly enjoyed cannot be commonly
shared, individuals and groups will seek to influence and control others
and their environment; that is, they will struggle for social and
material power. That is what politics is all about and what
distinguishes it from other modes of human behaviour.**]{.underline}
Politics so defined is largely absent from Linklater's book. **[Leaving
aside the problem of indivisible scarce goods, a meaningful reduction in
global material inequality would require significant sacrifices from
those enjoying the good life. Surely, no one really believes that the
'haves' will voluntarily hand over their riches to the 'have-nots'.
There is no historical precedent for such altruism on a global scale,
and, no matter how much we all communicate with each other in the
future, I cannot imagine that human nature will change so dramatically
in my lifetime.]{.underline}** Thus, unless one desperately wants to
believe in this alternative future world, Linklater's book will appear
as little more than an intellectual exercise in historical speculation
and theoretical wishful thinking along familar liberal lines.

### Perm Best- Policy Solutions

#### Political analysis is a mechanism in which we can learn to challenge current issues, find effective alternatives, and create better political solutions.

California Press. 44-76.\]

Classical policy analysis, however absent from actual policy making,
remains an important vehicle for teaching policy analysts the
connections between their analysis and the policymaking world in which
their recommendations would live. [**Even if** it implies more power
than analysts will ever have, classical **policy analysis** teaches that
politics, law, implementation, social structures, organizational
behavior, and other factors are **critical to policy outcomes** and must
play key roles in **thinking through** possible ways to address policy
problems]{.underline}. [**Bringing policy ideas to fruition**, bridging
the worlds of research and policy making, is a **critical skill** for
analysts to develop]{.underline}.¶ In addition, policy schools are
instilling in prospective policy analysts the structure and habits of
mind to engage successfully in the policy enterprise. 28 [Teaching
**disciplined thinking** for public service is important]{.underline}.
[Policy analysts not only have a **problem-oriented**,
**interdisciplinary** approach to policy and the **ability to
synthesize** and **bring policy relevance** to problems that social
scientists are not trained for, but they understand the \"rational
lunacy of policy-making systems\"]{.underline} (Weiss 2009).¶ In the
absence of written classical policy analyses, [policy analysts become
their human embodiment]{.underline}. [Their training will provide a
mental picture of how a classical policy analysis should be
performed]{.underline}. They can derive elements of policy analysis from
writing position papers, briefing policy makers, and controlling
meetings. [They **anticipate counterarguments** and frame their analyses
recognizing alternative options]{.underline}. In short, [the **mental
map** of a policy analysis allows good policy analysts not only to be
effective in their jobs but also to **advance** into the **public
debate** the appropriate elements of a policy analysis]{.underline}.
[Further, the **problem orientation** of policy analysis **focuses** at
least some **attention** on **social problems**, not just political
expediency]{.underline}. [**The role of policy analysts is not merely to
translate research for policy makers, but to use creative means to turn
available knowledge about the implications of various policy options
into actionable policy recommendations** appropriate for their
clients]{.underline}. [This is a subtle skill requiring attention to
both political realities and the best available research]{.underline}.¶
Finally, prospective policy analysts are instructed repeatedly about the
importance of their relationship to the client(s), yet far less
attention is paid to the other part of the policy analyst\'s
relationship: to the community of knowledge producers. [Policy analysts
play **critical roles as intermediaries** between \"custodians of the
knowable\" and policy makers. Their training should include the ability
to **understand** and **interpret** the academic literature on a topic
at a **far deeper level** than most journalists have the time or, often,
the analytic skill set to uncover]{.underline}. [Identifying and
**connect**ing **pertinent knowledge** and **analysis** with policy
makers should be a core principle of a public policy
education.]{.underline} Policy analysts may offer the central means to
provide policy makers with the key elements of classical policy
analysis, though not in the way, through written reports, it was
originally conceived. Creating a profession for committed, accomplished,
and well-trained individuals to participate in the world of public
policy may be among the most important contributions of policy analysis
education.

### Perm Best/Alt Fails- Specific Policies key

#### Perm is the best option- the alt's universalizing rhetoric papers over nuance- prefer the aff's ability to target and address specific threats of violence

**Browning & McDonald 13** (Christopher S., University of Queensland,
c/o Political Science and International Studies and Matt, University of
Queensland, "The future of critical security studies: Ethics and the
politics of security," European Journal of International Relations, Vol.
19, No. 2, pg. 248-251)

[If the critical security studies project is deficient in providing us
with a sophisticated and convincing understanding of]{.underline} either
[the politics or ethics of security]{.underline} --- two core animat -
ing themes of its research agenda --- [where does this leave such a
project?]{.underline} [Does the contribution of critical security
studies extend no further than a compelling critique of traditional
approaches to security on a range of analytical and normative
grounds?]{.underline} We would argue that [there is a future in critical
security studies]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} future [will ulti -
mately be determined by the extent to which scholars recognize the
limits and tensions of existing approaches]{.underline} (especially
'Schools') [and take up the challenge of moving beyond]{.underline}
first principles or [**universalized assumptions** about security to
engage in nuanced, reflexive and **context-specific** analyses of the
politics and ethics of security]{.underline}. Indeed, [we make such a
case using the critical theoretical tool of **immanent
critique**]{.underline}, defined here as [a method of critique concerned
with locating possibilities for progressive change in **existing social
and political orders**]{.underline}. 6 In this context, we note in
particular the possibility for building upon the tensions and limits in
existing critical security studies scholarship to move this research
project forward. [We identify two key imperatives for this
project]{.underline} by way of conclusion. [The first]{.underline} of
these imperatives concerns [the need to develop understandings of the
poli - tics of security that are context-specific; that
recognize]{.underline} and interrogate [the role of differ - ent
security discourses and]{.underline} their effects in different
[settings]{.underline}; and that come to terms with sedimented meanings
and logics without endorsing these as timeless and inevitable. In terms
of context-specificity, the Western-centric nature of (critical)
security studies has ultimately encouraged a focus on how security
'works' in liberal democratic settings. This is particularly applicable
to the Copenhagen School framework, whose dichotomy between 'panic
politics' and 'normal politics' ultimately suggests a conception of
politics parasitic on a liberal democratic political context (see
McDonald, 2008; Williams, 2003). While some have attempted to explore
securitization dynamics outside these settings (e.g. Wilkinson, 2007),
the framework itself continues to work with a security--politics
dichotomy that may be wholly unfamiliar to those outside liberal
democratic states. In a fundamentally illiberal state regime such as
Burma or North Korea, for example, what does the language of security do
and what does 'normal politics' mean? [In what ways do different
cultural, social and historical contexts determine different security
logics, and how do these dynamics look]{.underline} in terms of
communities above and below the state? [And can we accept the claim that
there is no difference in the logic or effects of securitization if
security is understood as referring to the welfare of the most
vulnerable in global soci - ety, for example, rather than the
territorial preservation of the nation-state?]{.underline} Here, the
[failure to differentiate between logics of security on the basis of
what understanding of security inheres in a particular
discourse]{.underline} potentially [blinds]{.underline} Copenhagen
School and [post- structural theorists]{.underline} of security [to (the
possibility of) difference in security dynamics and logics in different
places, for different actors and at different times]{.underline}. In the
case of the Copenhagen School, such parsimony might be in part a
response to the desire to provide analytical boundaries around the study
of security rather than 'descend' into contextual analysis (see
Williams, 2010: 213--216), but it nonetheless results in a partial and
(we would argue) Western-centric image of the politics of security. at
University of Kansas Libraries on February 25, 2016 ejt.sagepub.com
Downloaded from Browning and McDonald 249 Ultimately, these points
suggest the need for far more nuance than is currently evident in
critical security studies scholarship. As noted earlier, the critical
security studies pro - ject appears bifurcated between opposing logics
of security that position the logic of security as inherently pernicious
(Copenhagen School, post-structuralism) or inherently progressive (Welsh
School). In a sense, these 'Schools' correct the limits and tendencies
of each other in important ways, suggesting (immanent) possibilities for
a more nuanced understanding of the politics of security in the critical
security studies project as a whole. Copenhagen School and
post-structural theorists explore the logic of security that fol - lows
from the dominant discourse of security in contemporary world politics,
rightly cautioning against any assumed linkage between security and
progress and pointing to the ways in which the promise of security can
be used to justify illiberal practices. The Welsh School framework,
meanwhile, recognizes that this [dominant discourse of secu - rity does
not necessarily capture the essence of security across time and
space]{.underline}, in the process [pointing to **possibilities for
progressive change in security dynamics and prac - tices**]{.underline}.
In a sense, these different approaches to the logic of security broadly
reflect struc - tural and agential tendencies in International Relations
more generally. [We]{.underline} would [argue]{.underline} that they
suggest [the need to take seriously]{.underline} the [political
limitations associated with domi - nant security discourses while
recognizing and exploring the possibility for security to **mean and do
something different**]{.underline}. A brief [analysis of]{.underline}
the [different]{.underline} constitutive security logics underlying
various secu - [rity communities around the world provides ample
evidence of the **problems of univer - salizing claims** about the
politics of security]{.underline}. As Rumelili (2008) has noted, an
instructive [comparison can be drawn between the **EU and
ASEAN**]{.underline}, in particular [in terms of how these
organizations' conception of self-identity results in them
relating]{.underline} themselves [to otherness **very
differently**.]{.underline} [Propounding an inherently
inclusive]{.underline} (i.e. democratic) [identity and normative agenda,
the EU is liable to locate otherness in an inferior position to
itself]{.underline}, as something to transform and render
acceptable/normal. Otherness is therefore something to be eradicated and
to the extent to which it rejects transformation, it becomes
destabilizing and potentially threatening. Such processes are, for
example, clearly evident in the European Neighbourhood Policy (Browning
and Pertti, 2008). In [contrast, ASEAN operates with a largely
exclusivist]{.underline} (i.e. civili - zational, geographic, ethnic)
[identity where norms of sovereignty and non-interfer - ence
dominate]{.underline}. This, Rumelili suggests, facilitates more
equitable relationships with otherness since the goal in such
relationships is not one of conversion to the cause. In terms of the
politics of security, [what becomes evident]{.underline} here [is how
concepts of security and subjectivity are intimately connected to
conceptions of identity and **the limits of political community in
different contexts**]{.underline}. The second imperative for the future
of the critical security studies project concerns the ethics of
security. We advanced the claim that a shared concern with expanding the
realm of dialogue underpins much of the critical security studies
project, albeit to differ - ent degrees and in different ways. But to
the extent that an ethics of security --- a concep - tion of the good or
progress regarding security --- orients around a concern with such a
position, this commitment needs to be acknowledged and defended. A range
of pressing questions suggest themselves here, including the bases for
prioritizing open dialogue; the relationship between spheres of
deliberation and material conditions of existence; the at University of
Kansas Libraries on February 25, 2016 ejt.sagepub.com Downloaded from
250 European Journal of International Relations 19(2) possibilities for
and limitations to the establishment of open dialogue; and the broader
relationship between dialogue and outcomes. Elaborating on these
commitments would also entail engaging with the argument that movements
towards greater dialogue could potentially encourage the desire to
exclude power, identity, emotion and other central features of global
politics (see Price, 2008). Where difficult questions emerge about this
and other dimensions of an 'ethical' engagement with security --- such
as the role of violence in the Welsh School framework, for example
(Peoples, 2011) --- these need to be confronted. If there is a
consistency across critical security studies scholarship in this sense,
it is that ethical commitments are evident (in commitments to
resistance, desecuritization or emancipation, for example) but are
insufficiently developed to provide a genuine account of what
constitutes ethical action regarding security. Indeed, [immanent
possibilities for the development of the criti - cal security
studies]{.underline} project [arise from]{.underline} these (often
implied) [commitments that need draw - ing out and examining in the
**context of difficult dilemmas** in world politics]{.underline}. This
process of drawing out ethical commitments should be viewed as a
reflexive movement towards recognizing the assumptions and potential
implications of one's own theorizing, a posi - tion central to both
broader definitions of Critical Theory (see Cox, 1981) and to the
compelling critique of traditional security studies as insufficiently
engaged with the eth - ics and effects of its own theorizing about world
politics. And it needs also to be matched up with the preceding
understanding of the politics of security. Is the expansion of delib -
eration and movement away from violence, for example, always
progressive, and does it require the rejection of security as a
political category or its reform? The example of Australian debates
around the arrival by boat of asylum-seekers in 2010 illustrates
tensions and ambiguities at work regarding the ethics of security,
particu - larly as understood in key critical approaches to the study of
security. In that context, Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard's call for
'a frank, open, honest national conversation' about asylum and border
security particularly encouraged the articulation of negative and
exclusionary views of asylum-seekers, paradoxically rendering the
(re)securitization of asylum in the Australian context more likely (see
McDonald, 2011). Particularly strik - ing here was the Prime Minister's
suggestion that this national conversation should take place outside the
limits imposed by political correctness that would otherwise discourage
the articulation of right-wing or racist sentiments towards
asylum-seekers. In this exam - ple, the apparent opening of dialogic
space encouraged by the Prime Minister was inti - mately related to the
movement towards exclusionary security logics and practices orienting
around the imperatives of 'border security'. The point of this example
is not to illustrate the limits of open dialogue per se, but rather to
illustrate two broader claims regarding the relationship between
security and ethics in the critical security studies project that we
make here. First, while normative preferences are evident, these are
often insufficiently developed or robust to enable the ethical
adjudication between different practices or outcomes. The normative
preference for deliberation evident in the commitment to
desecuritization, for example, is not suf - ficiently robust to enable
us to engage with difficult questions concerning the forms of
deliberation that should be encouraged or even the circumstances in
which 'hate speech', for example, might be curtailed (on this, see
Gelber, 2010). Second, and to return to the central argument of the
article, the Australian example reminds us of the need to explore the
implications of security conceptions and practices in particular
contexts, rather than at University of Kansas Libraries on February 25,
2016 ejt.sagepub.com Downloaded from Browning and McDonald 251 assume
that a particular security logic will inhere --- or outcomes will follow
--- from the use of the term 'security' or a stated political commitment
to 'dialogue'. The core challenge for the critical security studies
project is ultimately moving beyond critique and agenda-setting and
towards a contextual analysis of security dynamics and practices in
global politics. There is no question that a focus on the politics of
security and the ethics of security are crucial intellectual endeavours
too readily elided or ignored in traditional approaches to the study of
security. For this reason alone we need a 'criti - cal security studies
project'. However, [universalizing claims concerning the politics of
security --- found in the **securitization framework** and much
**post-structural engagement with security** --- must]{.underline}
ultimately [**give way** to **nuanced analyses** of the ways in which
security is constructed and challenged in **particular social,
historical and political con - texts**]{.underline}. A range of
theorists have --- in different ways --- sought to engage with precisely
this question, illustrating the various ways in which security dynamics
'play out' in dif - ferent settings in terms of constructing community
(e.g. Bubandt, 2005), challenging identity binaries (e.g. Avant, 2007)
or enabling space for different forms of political response (e.g. Doty,
1998/9). Yet [these insights]{.underline} ultimately remain marginal to
key 'Schools' and conceptual frameworks of security, and [are too often
forgotten in our **search for the universal in a complex
world**]{.underline}. Beyond the development of nuance in our
understanding of the 'politics of security', the critical security
studies project urgently needs to move beyond normative 'leaps of faith'
concerning the ethics of security. This particularly applies to the
Copenhagen and Welsh School preference for dialogue as a progressive
means of escaping exclusive and illiberal security logics and practices.
While genuinely open dialogue regarding the construction of security and
threat has much to recommend it, crucial here is the need for advocates
to reflect upon and lay bare the bases upon which these claims are made
in philosophical terms, and to reflexively examine the implications of
alternative security conceptions and practices in analytical terms
rather than assume particular dynamics to be progressive.
[This]{.underline} too [suggests the need to]{.underline} move towards a
[focus on the particular social, historical and politi - cal **contexts
in which security is constructed** and practised in global
politics]{.underline}.

#### global liberal institutions are [inevitable and good]{.underline} -- reforming them requires [engagement]{.underline} and intellectual rejection causes [genocide and nuclear war]{.underline}.

**Shaw 99** (Martin, Professor of International Relations and Politics
at the University of Sussex, November 9, "The unfinished global
revolution: Intellectuals and the new politics of international
relations")

[The new politics of international relations require us]{.underline},
therefore, [to **go beyond the antiimperialism of the intellectual
left** as well as of the semi-anarchist traditions of the academic
discipline.]{.underline} We need to recognise three fundamental truths:
First, in the twenty-first century [people struggling for democratic
liberties across the non-Western world are likely to make constant
demands on our solidarity]{.underline}. Courageous academics, [students
and]{.underline} other [intellectuals will be in the forefront of these
movements]{.underline}. They deserve the unstinting support of
intellectuals in the West. Second, the old international thinking in
which democratic movements are seen as purely internal to states no
longer carries conviction -- despite the lingering nostalgia for it on
both the American right and the anti-American left. [The idea that
global principles can and should be enforced worldwide is **firmly
established in the minds of hundreds of millions of
people.**]{.underline} This consciousness will a powerful force in the
coming decades. Third, [**global state-formation is a fact**.
International institutions are being extended, and they have a symbiotic
relation with the major centre of state power]{.underline}, the
increasingly internationalised Western conglomerate. [The success of the
global-democratic revolutionary wave depends]{.underline} first on how
well it is consolidated in each national context -- but second, [on how
thoroughly it is embedded in international networks of power, at the
centre of which, **inescapably**, is the West]{.underline}. From these
political fundamentals, strategic propositions can be derived. First,
[democratic movements cannot regard]{.underline} non-governmental
organisations and [civil society as ends in themselves. They must aim to
civilise]{.underline} local [states, rendering them open, accountable
and pluralistic, and curtail the arbitrary and violent exercise of
power]{.underline}. Second, [democratising local states is not a
separate task from integrating them into global]{.underline} and often
Western-centred [networks]{.underline}. Reproducing isolated local
centres of power carries with it classic dangers of states as centres of
war. **[Embedding global norms and integrating new state centres with
global institutional frameworks are essential to the control of
violence]{.underline}**. (To put this another way, the proliferation of
purely national democracies is not a recipe for peace.) Third, while the
global revolution cannot do without the West and the UN, neither can it
rely on them unconditionally. [We need]{.underline} these [power
networks, but **we need to tame them**]{.underline}, too, [to make
their]{.underline} messy [bureaucracies]{.underline} enormously [more
accountable and sensitive to]{.underline} the needs of
[society]{.underline} worldwide. [This will involve]{.underline} the
kind of '[cosmopolitan democracy']{.underline} argued for by David
Held80 and campaigned for by the new Charter 9981. [It will]{.underline}
also [require us to **advance a global social-democratic agenda**, to
address]{.underline} the literally catastrophic scale of [world social
inequalities]{.underline}. Fourth, [if we need the global-Western state,
if we want to democratise it and make its institutions friendlier to
global peace and justice, **we cannot be indifferent to its strategic
debates.** It matters to develop robust peacekeeping as a strategic
alternative to bombing our way through zones of crisis. It matters that
international intervention supports pluralist structures, rather than
ratifying Bosnia-style apartheid]{.underline}. Likewise, [the internal
politics of Western elites matter. It makes a difference to halt the
regression to isolationist nationalism in American
politics]{.underline}. It matters that the European Union should develop
into a democratic polity with a globally responsible direction. It
matters that the British state, still a pivot of the Western system of
power, stays in the hands of outward-looking new social democrats rather
than inward-looking old conservatives. [As political intellectuals in
the West]{.underline}, we need to have our eyes on the ball at our feet,
but we also need to raise them to the horizon. [We need to grasp the
historic drama that is transforming worldwide relationships between
people and state]{.underline}, as well as between state and state. [We
need to think about how the turbulence of the global revolution can be
consolidated in democratic, pluralist, international networks of both
social relations and state authority]{.underline}. We cannot be simply
optimistic about this prospect. Sadly, it will require repeated violent
political crises to push Western governments towards the required
restructuring of world institutions.82 What I have outlined tonight is a
huge challenge; but [**the alternative is to see the global revolution
splutter into defeat, degenerate into new genocidal wars, perhaps even
nuclear conflicts.** The practical challenge for all concerned
citizens]{.underline}, and the theoretical and analytical challenges for
[students of international relations and politics, are
intertwined]{.underline}.

### At: Think Tanks/Experts Link

#### Think tanks and foreign policy experts are a necessary supplement for national security- they're crucial for immediate policy-relevant research

political science at Western University, where he has served as director
of the Center for American Studies, as chair of the political science
department, and as the founding director of the Canada-US Institute,
2006\]

[Hundreds of think tanks]{.underline} have not taken root in the United
States because of a perceived shortage of policy expertise. They
[have]{.underline} [proliferated]{.underline}, if we follow the logic of
Simon and Stevenson\'s argument, [because of a **lack of *specialized*
expertise**]{.underline}. [New think tanks may be required to address
the complex set of issues that have arisen]{.underline} in the
post---September I Ith world, [just as think tanks were created before
and after World War II to assist policy-makers to
**confront**]{.underline} a wide range of economic, social, and
**[security concerns]{.underline}**. What Simon and Stevenson are
suggesting is not radically different from what Robert Brookings, Andrew
Carnegie, and a group of engineers at Project Rand proposed decades ago.
[The rise of think tanks is]{.underline} also [closely associated
with]{.underline} [the type of expertise]{.underline} and services [they
offer and their ability to satisfy the needs of
policy-makers]{.underline}, journalists, opinion leaders,
philanthropists, and corporate and private donors [in ways that other
institutions]{.underline} engaged in research and analysis
[cannot]{.underline}. For example, [unlike university
professors]{.underline}, who in most instances must balance the demands
of teaching, research, and administration, [policy experts at think
tanks have the luxury of concentrating on]{.underline} what they do best
--- [monitoring, analyzing, and commenting on timely and relevant policy
issues]{.underline}. [Experts at think tanks]{.underline} often publish
books and articles that [stimulate discussion in the academic community,
but they]{.underline} [are]{.underline} concerned primarily with
[generating a range of research products]{.underline} that will be [of
immediate interest to policy-makers]{.underline} and to the public. They
cannot afford, as their colleagues in universities often can, to invest
five, ten, or even fifteen years on a research project. Moreover, most
private or independent think tanks do not have the luxury of relying, as
many academics at universities do, on government support for their
research. Although a handful of prominent think tanks continue to draw
heavily on government funding, many, including the vast majority of
advocacy think tanks, look to philanthropic foundations, corporations,
and private donors for assistance. Furthermore, like the institutes they
fund, donors have a vested interest in influencing the political climate
of the day. This in large part explains why so many advocacy think tanks
have been created over the past several decades. They have struck a
responsive chord with donors who are prepared to support their vision of
how the United States ought to be governed. [Experts at think tanks
understand the importance of responding to the needs of policy-makers
and therefore **make this a priority**]{.underline}. They need not be
reminded that securing a captive audience on Capitol Hill and/or in the
White House can pay handsome dividends. By contrast, scholars at
universities are rarely concerned about meeting the daily demands of
policy-makers. Instead, they prefer to engage in long-term research in
the hope that their findings, based on years of rigorous analysis, will
help to advance the public interest. In short, scholars working at think
tanks and universities have very different priorities, objectives, and
timelines. **[This is why]{.underline}** **[universities cannot be a
substitute for think tanks]{.underline}** and why think tanks cannot
take the place of universities.

Hypocritical to Criticize Russian Election Meddling?\"
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2018-03-12/us-hypocritical-criticize-russian-election-meddling>\]

[The U.S. response to Russian meddling]{.underline} in the 2016 election
[has been]{.underline} **[extraordinarily weak]{.underline}**. Not only
that, [it has been accompanied by]{.underline} an attitude of
"**[whataboutism]{.underline}**" [on the part of some
Americans---the]{.underline} **[relativistic view]{.underline}** [that
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[has]{.underline} **[little ground to complain]{.underline}** about
Russia's actions [given its own **history** of meddling in other
countries' political campaigns]{.underline} and elections. [It is
certainly **essential**]{.underline} [to be honest and realistic about
the considerable record of past U.S. electoral meddling]{.underline},
and the contrast between Russia and the United States in this domain is
certainly not black and white. [Yet neither is it one of
**indistinguishable shades of gray**]{.underline}. The United States is
simply not engaging in electoral meddling in a manner comparable to
Russia's approach.

THE PAST IS NOT THE PRESENT

[**Two key flaws** underlie relativist accounts]{.underline}. First,
such a position fails to distinguish adequately between the pattern of
U.S. interventionism during the Cold War, on the one hand, and U.S.
activity since the end of the Cold War on the other. During the former
period, [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [did indeed illegitimately intervene in
numerous foreign elections,]{.underline} trying to tilt outcomes in
favor of candidates the United States preferred and in a smaller number
of cases laboring to oust legitimately elected leaders Washington saw as
hostile to its security and economic interests. The record is long and
dark, marked by some especially well-known cases in Guatemala and Iran
in the early 1950s and in Chile and Nicaragua in the 1970s and 1980s.

[Since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}, however, [such
interventionism has **decreased significantly** because U.S.
policymakers no longer view the world as enmeshed in a]{.underline}
**[global ideological struggle]{.underline}** [in which every
country]{.underline}, no matter how small, [is a critical piece on a
larger **strategic chessboard**]{.underline}. Washington has thus become
much less concerned about the outcomes of most foreign elections and
much less engaged in trying to tilt them in any particular direction.

Of course, one can identify a few cases over the past 25 years when the
United States has tried to manipulate foreign elections with the aim of
getting its preferred candidate into power. When Russian President Boris
Yeltsin faced reelection in 1996, the Clinton administration mobilized
some economic relief to Yeltsin, to try to help him win. In the
Palestinian elections of 2006, the George W. Bush administration
employed U.S. economic assistance to try to bolster Fatah in its contest
with Hamas (with predictably counterproductive results). In the lead up
to the 2005 Iraqi elections, the Bush administration formulated a plan
to funnel covert funds to favored Iraqi candidates and parties but
reportedly backed away from the plan after Congress objected. In 2009,
according to former Defense Secretary Robert Gates' memoir, the United
States worked behind the scenes prior to the Afghanistan elections to
push President Hamid Karzai aside and keep him from winning.

There have no doubt been other cases, known only to those with access to
classified information. Yet [**on the whole**, U.S. electoral meddling
has **decreased significantly**]{.underline} since the Cold War years.
[This is true because of the change in U.S. **interests** and because of
an **evolution of norms**]{.underline} [in many parts of the U.S. policy
establishment about the acceptability of such actions.]{.underline} The
overall picture today is of a [Russia actively expanding its covert
electoral meddling in multiple regions as U.S. meddling **continues to
decline.**]{.underline} Those convinced that Washington must still
routinely use covert means to influence election outcomes all around the
world should consider the available evidence: in the last few years the
rising pattern of [Russian efforts to **manipulate the political life**
of]{.underline} countries in central **[Europe]{.underline}**, western
Europe, the Balkans, [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [and]{.underline} **[Latin
America]{.underline}** [has left many telltale
**fingerprints**]{.underline}---[it seems highly unlikely Washington
could have carried out a **similar pattern** of activities and not leave
behind at least **some noticeable traces**]{.underline} of them.

WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT DEMOCRACY PROMOTION?

A second problematic element of [the relativist position is the charge
that U.S. efforts to **promote democracy**]{.underline} abroad---which
make use of diplomatic leverage, democracy aid, and cooperation with
pro-democratic multilateral organizations---[are just another, more
**covert form**]{.underline} [of electoral meddling]{.underline} akin to
what the Russians are doing. Russian President Vladimir
**[Putin]{.underline}** [is a **strong subscriber to this
viewpoint**]{.underline}, convinced that U.S. and other Western
democracy programs in his country represent efforts to manipulate its
domestic political life against him. Many Western observers---acutely
aware of the long record of U.S. interventionism---have their suspicions
as well.

[U.S. pro-democracy diplomacy and assistance do indeed seek to shape the
political direction of other countries]{.underline}. And they are
carried out with a strong sense of self-interest, not out of unalloyed
idealism. They are driven by the belief that democratic outcomes abroad
will generally be favorable to U.S. security and economic interests by
producing stable governments amenable to deeper partnerships thanks to
shared political values. But unlike Russian electoral meddling, [U.S.
democracy promotion does not seek to **exacerbate** sociopolitical
**divisions**]{.underline}, [systematically spread
**lies**]{.underline}, [favor **particular candidates**, or undercut the
technical **integrity of elections**]{.underline}. On the whole, [it
seeks to help citizens exercise their basic **political**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[civil rights]{.underline}** in electoral processes,
enhance the technical integrity of such processes, and increase
electoral transparency.

**[Skeptics]{.underline}** reluctant to accept the idea that democracy
diplomacy and assistance are not about manipulating elections [should
look at some **recent cases**---such as U.S. efforts to
support]{.underline} **[Tunisia]{.underline}**'s democratic evolution,
[to help]{.underline} **[Gambia]{.underline}** resolve the blockage that
followed its 2016 elections, [to encourage the]{.underline}
**[Hungarian]{.underline}** [government to respect media freedom and
civic space, and to push the **Myanmar military**]{.underline} [at the
start of this decade to make room for at least some **democratic
political life**]{.underline} in the country.

Skeptics should also note that although the [U.S. organizations
**engaged in democracy**]{.underline} work are mostly funded by the U.S.
government itself, they [are **regularly at odds** with the preferences
of U.S. **diplomats**]{.underline}, [who often hold on to relationships
with **friendly autocrats**]{.underline}, as they are wary of the
strategic value of democratic change. In the mid-1990s, [this was true
in]{.underline} **[Indonesia]{.underline}** [under]{.underline} former
President **[Suharto]{.underline}** [and in **Kazakhstan**]{.underline}
[under]{.underline} President Nursultan **[Nazarbayev]{.underline}**.
And in the first decade of this century, [the same occurred in
**Egypt**]{.underline} [under]{.underline} former President Hosni
[Mubarak and in]{.underline} **[Azerbaijan]{.underline}**
[under]{.underline} the **[Aliyev]{.underline}** family. Skeptics should
also bear in mind that in most cases where [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is
engaged]{.underline} in promoting democracy abroad, it is working
[alongside]{.underline} and sometimes in active partnership with [other
democracies not known for geopolitical **interventionism**]{.underline},
[such as Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden]{.underline}.

GRAY AREAS Although the overall case is strong for distinguishing U.S.
democracy support abroad from the sort of political meddling that Russia
is now making a habit of, there are several difficult issues that
necessarily complicate the comparison. First, in a small but important
number of cases, the United States does assist one side of a contested
electoral campaign against the other. This occurs when a strongman
leader of doubtful democratic fidelity is trying to legitimate himself
and perpetuate his rule through elections. In various such cases, as
with Chilean President Augusto Pinochet's plebiscite in 1988, Slobodan
Milosevic's reelection campaign in 2000, and various Belarusian
elections in the 2000s, the United States and a number of other Western
actors offered assistance both to the opposition political forces
challenging the strongman and to civic groups that were mobilizing
get-out-the-vote campaigns. From the Western point of view, such actions
are not interfering in a free and fair election but rather trying to
help level the playing field in an election that is stacked unfairly
against the challengers. From the point of view of the power holders, of
course, the United States and its allies are trying to shape the outcome
of the election in a partisan fashion. Second, although U.S. and other
Western assistance to civil society aims to aid civic actors in their
advocacy of rights and democracy---not to take sides in partisan
political struggles and campaigns---the line between political society
and civil society is often blurry. What to Western providers are
principled civic actors working to advance universally valid political
and civil rights and democratic values such as transparency and
accountability, are to local authorities political animals cloaked in
civic garb challenging their hold on power. This is especially true in
partially or fully closed political environments such as exist in
Cambodia and Venezuela, where regimes have choked off the opposition and
demonstrated an ability to undermine elections. Third, despite the fact
that most U.S. and Western democracy promotion is carried out in a
transparent manner, some aid providers are becoming less transparent in
their assistance in order to protect their recipients from being
harassed or persecuted. As a result, a growing number of regimes have
accused the West of engaging in clandestine political meddling. This
scenario creates a vicious cycle in which undemocratic regimes charge
democracy promoters of secretive meddling and persecute those they work
with, thus driving such organizations to adopt less transparent methods.
This in turn further reinforces the perception of secretive meddling.
U.S. democracy assistance directed at Iran, for example, has become much
less transparent over the past ten years as crackdowns by the Iranian
government on recipients of foreign assistance have intensified. Fourth,
U.S. democracy policy is markedly inconsistent, even though U.S. efforts
to promote democracy in other countries are generally driven by genuine
pro-democracy motives. The U.S. government makes more funds available
for democracy programs in countries that the United States views as
strategic enemies, such as Iran and Cuba, than it does in nondemocratic
countries the United States views as strategic partners, such as Saudi
Arabia and Ethiopia. The inconsistency is not absolute. Washington does
make some efforts to promote democracy and rights in states ruled by
"friendly tyrants." The Trump administration's decision last year to
withhold some U.S. assistance to Egypt as a means of expressing
dissatisfaction with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's antidemocratic
policies is just one example. And the fact that one is inconsistent in
applying the principle does not render meaningless the applications that
are made. Nevertheless, the inconsistency hurts the larger case that
democracy promotion has real roots in principle.

DIVERGENT PATHS

**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to move forward in
putting together an **effective response**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}

argument that Washington has **no moral standing for
objecting**]{.underline} to such [actions is certainly **one necessary
step**.]{.underline} The arguments over "whataboutism" merit some
careful reflection and assessment given that the facts are not simple
and not all the facts are available. [The **U**nited

meddling]{.underline}, particularly during the Cold War. Yet [the trends

convergent---[with Russia on the **negative side of the
divide**]{.underline}. And although the domain of [U.S. democracy
promotion is hardly]{.underline} free of flaws and serious past
mistakes, it is not [the **dark twin** of the illicit, covert election
meddling that Russia]{.underline} [seems intent on making one of its

### At: Structures Inevitable

#### Structures are not inevitable, but rather alterable through responsible political decision-making 

**Zanotti 17**---Associate Professor Department of Political Science,
Virginia Tech (Laura, "Reorienting IR: Ontological Entanglement, Agency,
and Ethics," International Studies Review, January 13, 2017)

In this article, I have argued that in order for IR to remain
politically relevant and critical, we must rethink and reflect on the
ontological, epistemological, and methodological assumptions of the
discipline. I then explored how [**onto-epistemologies**, ethics, and
political agency are **interlinked**]{.underline}. Ontologies of
entanglement tend to embrace complex conceptualizations of causality and
the morphogenetic properties of what exist. In a quantum world,
ontological cuts happen in practices. [This]{.underline} worldview
[invites a **reconsideration** of the way we **justify**]{.underline}
and address [**political decisions** and **ethical action** beyond the
**universalism** supported by atomistic ontologies and the **stifling
limits** imposed by substantialist-structuralism]{.underline}. As Nick
Onuf has argued, "In a straightened world, as [in a world in turmoil,
talk of universal principles **rings hollow**]{.underline}... [In such a
world, positional ethics is the **best we can hope for**]{.underline}"
(Onuf forthcoming, quoted with permission).

[A quantum reconceptualization of our being in the world and our
relation to matter calls for a **profound sense of modesty**, as well as
for the **central role of responsibility** for taking political
decisions. In an entangled world that is **not governed** by
**theoretically detectable**, **linear**, and **immutable laws** of
history, but instead by **intra-agential processes**, the conditions of
possibility for political agency are rooted in]{.underline} the
morphogenetic properties of **[practices]{.underline}**. Taking
responsibility for critically questioning what exists without the hubris
of assuming our ability to ordain outcomes displays an affinity with
Foucault's methodological and political project. In this vein, [ethical
guidelines **may not be grounded on abstractions** stemming from the
solitary ruminations of an individual's mind]{.underline}. [Prudence,
responsibility]{.underline}, and practices of cultivation of the self
[offer pathways to **overcome the limitations** of]{.underline} the
Kantian categorical imperative by which **[universal
prescriptions]{.underline}** are the main way of validating ethical
choices. As Patomäki has shown, [universalism may elicit
**exclusionary** and **violent practices**]{.underline}. Moreover, as
Connolly has argued, [the nostalgia for a slowly moving world regulated
by **linear relations of causality** and characterized by **certainty**
and **stability** may be the **root of fundamentalism**.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [if we accept]{.underline} Barad's position [that we are
"**of the world**" and not **above the world**, theorizing looks more
like a practice endowed with **performative political effects** than a
**quest** for the discovery of the "**true nature**" of what
exists]{.underline}. Therefore, [intellectual undertakings are a **form
of political agency** and come with **great responsibility**. Such
responsibility **requires** the need for **exercising prudence** in
making truth statements about what is **universally good** or
**naturally inevitable**. Assumptions about]{.underline} linearity of
causal relations, **[universal]{.underline}** laws of history, or
**[ontological properties]{.underline}** of entities [yield]{.underline}
two [**problematic effects**. On the one hand, they may **stifle
political imagination**; on the other hand, they could encourage actions
based upon **abstract prescriptions** rather than upon **careful
diagnosis** of the forces that obtain in the situation at hand. In an
entangled world, **there are no externalities**. Arguments that **divert
responsibility** by basing political choices upon **abstract
principles** or **aspirations** and]{.underline}, as a result, [that
treat **what happens on the ground** as "**unintended consequences**" or
"**collateral damage**," are **ethically thin** and **politically
dangerous**.]{.underline}

In fact, [**unintended consequences** may well be the result of
**irresponsible political decision-making** that does not include a
**competent assessment** of the **practical configurations** that
constitute the **context of action** and the **means necessary** to
achieve stated goals. Such attitudes]{.underline}, Amoureux and Steele
(2014) have suggested, [have led to **disastrous initiatives**, such as
the **Bush administration's invasion of Iraq**]{.underline}. Likewise,
Kennedy (2006) has shown that [the]{.underline} bland
[rhetoric]{.underline} of jus in bello that provides standardized
criteria regarding the number of acceptable civilian casualties
(conveniently called collateral damage) [produces the effect of
**diverting responsibility** from those who conduct war while
**assuaging their consciences** concerning the injuries and deaths their
choices are inflicting]{.underline}. Kennedy (2004) has also shown that
[as a result of the preference for **universal normativity**,
the]{.underline} human rights [profession]{.underline} (which he calls
"the invisible college") [is more concerned with **protecting abstract
norms** than with **acting politically** so as to **devise viable
solutions** to **specific problems**.]{.underline}

Universal norms and bureaucratic routines play a major role in
prescribing and justifying UN peacekeeping interventions. As Jean Marie
Guehénno argued more than a decade ago, strategies of international
intervention based upon assumptions of causal linearity and invariance
may amount to hubris. Norms and rules can also offer grounds for
appeasement. The massacres that occurred in Rwanda and Srebrenica in the
1990s provide examples of how, by uncritically following
institutionalized rules, United Nations peacekeepers permitted
atrocities. UN employees are not cold-blooded monsters or extremely
callous individuals. They follow norms and rules, key examples of which
include the principle of "impartiality," Security Council mandates, and
"rules of engagement." By doing so, however, they have often fallen
short of considering the possible consequences of decisions in specific
situations. The United Nations' failure to take action to prevent the
Rwanda and Srebrenica genocide testifies to the fact that following
universal norms (i.e., the imperative to preserve impartiality) and
bureaucratic reasoning (i.e., the rules of engagement prescribing not to
intervene to disarm any party of the conflict) set the stage for
avoiding a careful assessment of what was at stake on the eve of the
massacres. These ways of reasoning also appeased consciences for not
making decisions accountable to the people in danger (Zanotti 2014).

Significantly, [the **lack of prudence** that derives from **broad
overgeneralizations** and **reliance on abstractions**, **rather** than
**careful consideration** of **what the case demands**, threatens **more
self-defeating outcomes** in peacekeeping and international politics.
This is why a **careful reflection** of the ways our political choices
are **validated ontologically** and **epistemologically** is of
**paramount practical importance**]{.underline}. Seven decades ago, Carr
(1946) advocated the need for conceptualizing political agency and
ethics in a way that addresses both the limits of the idealist illusion
regarding the possibility to transform reality through acts of will as
well as the realist persuasion about the inescapable subordination of
actors to external conditions. Both of [these positions]{.underline},
Carr pointed out, [lead to **self-defeating outcomes** and **stifle
political imagination** because they **focus on general abstractions**,
**failing** to take into consideration what conditions and political
opportunity **actually obtain** in **specific historical
configurations**]{.underline}.

Here I have proposed that [an ontology of entanglement fosters an
**ethic of engagement** and **activism**]{.underline} along the lines
suggested by Foucault and opens up possibilities for political action.
In this ontological horizon, [what qualifies as meaningful agency is
**not stifled** by]{.underline} the structuralist commitment to the
stabilizing effects of structures (like in Waltz's) or by [the
**inescapable features** of an **oppressive** and **alienating social
order** that **dispossess subjects of their humanity** and **reduces
them to "bare life"**]{.underline} (as in Agamben). Instead,
[micropolitical interventions]{.underline}, parrēsia, and the
cultivation of a particular kind of character, [**while not
revolutionizing the status quo**, may be relevant to **triggering social
change**]{.underline}. Importantly, [ontologies of entanglement also
**raise the bar** for **adjudicating** the **ethical validity of
political choices**. Radical assumption of responsibility **drastically
limits what is acceptable** as "**unintended consequences**." This is
**important** for]{.underline} the way international organizations make
decisions regarding international peacekeeping interventions and for
[**the way politicians decide to wage war**. **Ethically** and
**politically sound** decision-making **cannot** be based mainly
upon]{.underline} the apodictic recognition of universal rules of
behavior, [**abstract aspirations**, or **overarching theories** of the
functioning of society. They must also include **careful analysis** of
how]{.underline} clusters of [causes may **generate effects** in the
**specific contexts** at hand and **take responsibility**
for]{.underline} the ontological cuts [our initiatives]{.underline}
operate [and for the]{.underline} morphogenetic [processes they may set
off.]{.underline}
