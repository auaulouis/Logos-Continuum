#### US aligned in the Indo-Pacific now -- plan shifts alliance commitments to Europe.

**Hudson '22** (John Hudson is a national security reporter at the
Washington Post covering the State Department and diplomacy. "Russian
aggression must not distract from China threat, Blinken says", The
Washington Post, May 26, 2022,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/05/26/russia-china-united-states-blinken/>)

[The United States must remain focused on the economic and military
threat posed by China despite the challenges presented by
Russia]{.underline} and other top adversaries, Secretary of State Antony
[Blinken said Thursday in a widely anticipated address on U.S.-China
policy. The Biden administration has long singled-out China as the
"biggest geopolitical test of the 21st century,]{.underline}" but
Russia's three-month war in Ukraine has consumed the White House's time
and attention as the death toll climbs and the fighting sends energy
prices and inflation soaring. In [[Blinken]{.underline}]{.mark}'s
address, the culmination of months of internal deliberations over how to
approach Beijing, he [[emphasized that **China**, unlike Russia, **is
the only country powerful enough to challenge U.S. dominance** on the
world stage]{.mark}.]{.underline} "Even as President Putin's war
continues, we will remain focused on the most serious long-term
challenge to the international order --- and that's posed by the
People's Republic of China," Blinken said. ["China is the only country
with both the intent to reshape the international order, and
increasingly the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power
to do it.]{.underline}" Blinken said allowing China to dominate the 21st
century given its lack of respect for human rights "would move us away
from the universal values that have sustained so much of the world's
progress over the past 75 years." He specifically called out the
country's human rights practices in Tibet, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, where
he accused Beijing of carrying out "genocide" against Uyghurs and other
ethnic minorities. On a range of humanitarian, economic and security
issues, [[Blinken said the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [was
"**more aligned** with partners across the Indo-Pacific" **than
ever**]{.mark} before]{.underline}. From the George W. Bush
administration onward, American presidents have sought to reorient U.S.
foreign and defense policy toward Asia, home to many of the world's
fastest-growing economies. But geopolitical events in Europe and the
Middle East have presented myriad distractions.

#### Pivot to Asia [now]{.underline}.

**Sun, '22** (Yun Sun directs the China program at the Stimson Center, a
nonprofit think tank based in Washington D.C.. "After Biden\'s pivot to
Asia, China feels the chill," Politico, 6/23/22,

[[The Biden administration,]{.mark} hoping to counter China's growing
influence in Asia, [has initiated several high-level engagements with
Asia in recent months]{.mark}, ranging from summits to a presidential
visit to the region.]{.underline} Despite lukewarm reception at home,
[[it's now clear that **Washington's Asia pivot** caused much anxiety in
China]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The administration\'s outreach started with Southeast Asia]{.underline}
--- the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit in Washington in mid-May [followed by
President JOE BIDEN's high-profile visit to South Korea and Japan on May
19-24. In Japan, [Biden attended a summit with leaders of Japan,
Australia and India]{.mark} (the Quad) [and launched the]{.mark}
long-expected[[ Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/23/asian-nations-biden-indo-pacific-economic-framework-00034247).]{.mark}]{.underline}

The anxiety that the outreach generated in Beijing was not limited to
Biden's comment in Tokyo that the U.S. will intervene militarily if
China attacks Taiwan. [[More unsettling for Beijing was the public
commitment by]{.mark} U.S. allies --- [South Korea and Japan]{.mark} ---
[to the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,]{.mark} which implied
potential roles for them in a future Taiwan contingency.]{.underline}

In this sense, [**[Biden's Asia engagement is a good beginning to align
with allies and partners]{.mark}.** But the region will need to see even
more of Washington and in a sustainable manner.]{.underline}

[[The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [will keep its focus on the

crisis,]{.underline} the White House Indo-Pacific policy coordinator
said on Monday, [adding Washington has been deeply engaged in two
theaters simultaneously before, including during World War Two and the
Cold War.]{.underline} \"It's difficult. It's expensive. But it is also
essential, and I believe that we're entering a period where that is what
will be demanded of the United States and this generation of
Americans,\" the official, Kurt Campbell, told an event hosted by the
German Marshall Fund of the United States. [\"There is a deep
recognition and intention here inside the government, in the White
House, to sustain every element of our engagement in the Indo-Pacific,"
Campbell said.]{.underline} [Campbell said]{.underline} coming months
would show [[U.S. \"determination\" to sustain **high-level
engagement**]{.mark} with the region]{.underline} President Joe
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} [[has declared a priority for]{.mark}
policy and [**resources** in pushing back against **China\'**]{.mark}s
expanding [influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Biden plans to host a summit
with Southeast Asian leaders in March and attend a summit of the Quad
grouping of the United States, Australia, Japan and India in May. read
more Campbell said Biden would travel too for meetings involving
Southeast Asian states this year. [Biden is also sending a delegation of
former senior security officials to Taiwan on Monday in a show of
support for the island amid fears that China]{.underline} might seek to
take advantage of a distracted West to move against it. \"You will see a
whole range of activities across the board, diplomatically,
institutionally \... investment, and also economic and trade,\" Campbell
said. Mira Rapp-Hooper, a director for U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy at the
White House National Security Council, said she was confident that the
Russian invasion of Ukraine would not divert from U.S. [Indo-Pacific
goals. \"There is]{.underline} a way that the resources we are sending
to Ukraine right now are actually quite distinct from what we are trying
to do on the Indo Pacific strategy,\" she said. \"That does not mean
that we won't feel moments of resource scarcity, but it does mean that
we can plan both simultaneously.\" Campbell and Rapp-Hooper said the
world was watching closely China\'s position towards Russia\'s invasion,
which happened three weeks after Beijing and Moscow announced an
enhanced strategic partnership. The White House has called on China to
condemn Russia\'s actions, the largest assault on a European state since
World War Two. Campbell said China was in an awkward position, but
Washington wanted to keep communication lines with Beijing open. He said
he believed Chinese leaders \"have been concerned\" by the solidarity of
U.S. allies and partners and also by the \"brutality\" of Russia\'s
invasion. \"It is undeniable that right now China is occupying an
awkward nexus in which they\'re trying to sustain their deep and
fundamental relationship with Russia.\" Campbell said it was too early
to tell what conclusions China would draw, but Washington had explained
to Beijing in advance the risks associated with Russia\'s invasion.
\"It\'s clear from our perspective that the association, so public and
so deep, between Russia and China is indeed quite uncomfortable right
now[.\"]{.underline} Beijing has largely steered clear of criticizing
Moscow, but has stressed its traditional position on the need to respect
sovereignty and territorial integrity and last week abstained in a U.N.
vote on a resolution condemning the Russian invasion. At the same event,
the head of Asia policy for the European Union\'s diplomatic service,
Gunnar Wiegand, also stressed the need to keep negotiation channels open
with China, while the [[**EU** special envoy]{.mark} for the
Indo-Pacific, Gabriele Visentin[, said events in Ukraine would encourage
the bloc to **step up engagement with Asia**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[On Monday, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates again [accused China of
cyberattacks]{.mark}. But these attacks were highly aggressive, and they
reveal that China has transformed into a far more sophisticated and
mature digital adversary than the one that flummoxed U.S. officials a
decade ago.]{.underline} The Biden administration's indictment for the
cyberattacks, along with interviews with dozens of current and former
American officials, shows that China has reorganized its hacking
operations in the intervening years. While it once conducted relatively
unsophisticated hacks of foreign companies, think tanks and government
agencies, [[China is]{.mark} now [perpetrating]{.mark} stealthy,

the direction of [China's Ministry of State Security]{.mark}, according
to U.S. officials and the indictment.]{.underline} While phishing
attacks remain, the espionage campaigns have gone underground and employ
sophisticated techniques. Those include exploiting "zero-days," or
unknown security holes in widely used software like Microsoft's Exchange

periods. "What we've seen over the past two or three years is an
upleveling" by China, said George Kurtz, the chief executive of the
cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. "They operate more like a professional

United States. [In [a]{.mark} 2009 classified [National Intelligence
Estimate]{.mark}, a document that represents the consensus of all 16
U.S. intelligence agencies, China and Russia topped the list of
America's online adversaries. But China was deemed the more immediate
threat because of the volume of its industrial trade theft.]{.underline}
But that threat is even more troubling now because of China's revamping
of its hacking operations. Furthermore, the Biden administration has
turned cyberattacks --- including ransomware attacks --- into a major
diplomatic front with superpowers like Russia, and U.S. relations with
China have steadily deteriorated over issues including trade and tech
supremacy. China's prominence in hacking first came to the fore in 2010
with attacks on Google and RSA, the security company, and again in 2013
with a hack of The New York Times. Those breaches and thousands of
others prompted the Obama administration to finger China's People's
Liberation Army hackers in a series of indictments for industrial trade
theft in 2014. [A single Shanghai-based unit of the People's Liberation
Army, known as Unit 61398, was responsible for hundreds --- some
estimated thousands --- of breaches of American companies, The Times
reported. In 2015, Obama officials threatened to greet President Xi
Jinping of China with an announcement of sanctions on his first visit to
the White House, after a particularly aggressive breach of the U.S.
Office of Personnel Management.]{.underline} In that attack, Chinese
hackers made off with sensitive personal information, including more
than 20 million fingerprints, for Americans who had been granted a
security clearance. White House officials soon struck a deal that China
would cease its hacking of American companies and interests for its
industrial benefit. For 18 months during the Obama administration,
security researchers and intelligence officials observed a notable drop
in Chinese hacking. After President Donald J. Trump took office and
accelerated trade conflicts and other tensions with China, the hacking
resumed. By 2018, U.S. intelligence officials had noted a shift:
[People's Liberation Army hackers had stood down and been replaced by
operatives working at the behest of the Ministry of State Security,
which handles China's intelligence, security and secret
police]{.underline}. Hacks of intellectual property, that benefited
China's economic plans, originated not from the P.L.A. but from a looser
network of front companies and contractors, including engineers who
worked for some of the country's leading technology companies, according
to intelligence officials and researchers. It was unclear how exactly
China worked with these loosely affiliated hackers. Some cybersecurity
experts speculated that the engineers were paid cash to moonlight for
the state, while others said those in the network had no choice but to
do whatever the state asked. In 2013, a classified U.S. National
Security Agency memo said, "[The exact affiliation with Chinese
government entities is not known, but their activities indicate a
probable intelligence requirement feed from China's Ministry of State
Security."]{.underline} On Monday, the White House provided more
clarity. In its detailed indictment, [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [accused China's Ministry of State Security of being
behind an aggressive assault on Microsoft's Exchange email systems this
year.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Justice Department separately indicted
four Chinese nationals for coordinating the hacking of trade secrets
from companies in aviation, defense, biopharmaceuticals and other
industries. According to the indictments, Chinese nationals operated
from front companies, like Hainan Xiandun, that the Ministry of State
Security set up to give Chinese intelligence agencies plausible
deniability. The indictment included a photo of one defendant, Ding
Xiaoyang, a Hainan Xiandun employee, receiving a 2018 award from the
Ministry of State Security for his work overseeing the front company's
hacks. The United States also accused Chinese universities of playing a
critical role, recruiting students to the front companies and running
their key business operations, like payroll. [The indictment also
pointed to [Chinese "government-affiliated" hackers for conducting
ransomware attacks that extort companies for millions of
dollars]{.mark}.]{.underline} Scrutiny of ransomware attackers had
previously largely fallen on Russia, Eastern Europe and North Korea.
Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in a statement on Monday that
China's Ministry of State Security "has fostered an ecosystem of
criminal contract hackers who carry out both state-sponsored activities
and cybercrime for their own financial gain[." [China has also clamped
down on research about]{.underline}]{.mark} [vulnerabilities in widely
held software and hardware, which could potentially benefit [the state's
surveillance, counterintelligence and cyberespionage campaigns.]{.mark}
Last week, it announced a new policy requiring Chinese security
researchers to notify the state within two days when they found security
holes, such as the "zero-days" that the country relied on in the breach
of Microsoft Exchange systems.]{.underline}

[[Officials]{.mark} and experts [throughout Asia expressed shock]{.mark}
last month [when a]{.mark} leaked [document emerged showing a draft of a
"security cooperation" agreement between China and the Solomon
Islands]{.mark}]{.underline}, a small former British colony in the South
Pacific that has been independent since 1978. [The draft agreement would
enable Beijing to send armed police or military personnel, at the
request of the Solomon Islands, for a variety of purposes, including to
"assist in maintaining social order."]{.underline} Marked confidential,
the agreement would also expand the Chinese military's ability to send
ships and troops to protect Chinese people and projects on the islands.
If you haven't been paying attention to the Solomon Islands government,
led by Beijing-friendly Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, you're like
most policymakers in Washington. [But if you doubt the islands'
strategic significance, just look at the map. A Chinese military
presence there would put People's Liberation Army troops less than a
five-hour flight from the eastern coast of Australia and far closer to
U.S. territories than ever before.]{.underline} China surely hasn't
forgotten the role played by the Solomon Islands in World War II,
especially during the 1942-43 Battle of Guadalcanal. ["Ensuring that
these islands, within striking distance of Australia and occupying
critical strategic geography, remain free from Chinese coercion and
military presence is a massive strategic imperative for the U.S. and
Australia,"]{.underline} Alex Gray, director for Oceania and
Indo-Pacific Security at the National Security Council during the Trump
administration, told me. Predictably, Beijing says that the agreement is
no big deal and is "beyond reproach." But the U.S. and Australian
governments have been scrambling to try to stop its completion.
Australian officials are engaged in frantic shuttle diplomacy with the
Sogavare government. President Biden's top NSC official for Asia, Kurt
Campbell, will become the administration's first senior official to
visit the Solomon Islands next week, in a regional tour that will
include several other stops. It was Campbell who predicted in January
that China would unveil a "strategic surprise" in the Pacific this year.
Clearly, the U.S. and Australian governments had some indication that
this was coming. Yet neither seems to have done much to try to prevent
the Chinese move. Now, experts say, both governments are struggling to
catch up to Beijing. "Reversing momentum, rather than stopping it in the
first place, is risky and expensive," said former Australian national
security official John Lee, now with the Hudson Institute. "The failure
to do more to prevent the deal from even being contemplated means the
U.S. and allies will need to spend more resources and regional political
capital than they would like." Biden administration officials maintain
that they are, in fact, heavily engaged in the Pacific Islands. Biden
spoke to Pacific Island leaders in August, via Zoom. Secretary of State
Antony Blinken visited Fiji in February. Last month, Biden appointed
Ambassador Joseph Yun as a special envoy to work on completing
negotiations to renew U.S. compacts with three other Pacific Island
nations. State Department climate envoy John F. Kerry attended a
conference in Palau this week. A senior Biden administration official
told me that covid restrictions hampered face-to-face diplomacy until
recently, but the official assured me that the Biden team is determined
to step up the United States' game in this region. Nevertheless, details
of exactly how the Biden administration plans to try to persuade
Sogavare to turn away from China are scarce. "This did not come as a
surprise, and this is not the only place in the Pacific or globally
where China is extraordinarily active," the official said. \"This is but
a recent manifestation, and it's probably one of the boldest[.\" To be
sure, [the Solomon Islands is only one of many places in the Pacific
Islands where China is expanding its influence.]{.mark} Beijing has
persuaded two Pacific island countries to drop diplomatic recognition of
Taiwan in recent years, including the Solomon Islands. [China offers
tempting packages of economic, diplomatic and military aid while bribing
any and all corrupt leaders in these countries.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Rather than reacting case by case, the United States and allied
governments need to come to the table with substantive, long-term offers
of aid and investment to reassure these Pacific Island nations that they
have another option besides betting their future on partnership with
Beijing. **[[Russia is an urgent threat, but China is the more serious
long-term competitor]{.underline}]{.mark}**, only too happy to exploit
our distraction[. [Xi has global ambitions]{.underline}]{.mark}[, which
means [we must confront his aggression in many places at once]{.mark}.
If the Pacific Islands become China's outposts, the region and the world
will be a much more dangerous place.]{.underline}

reflecting a shifting balance of power in the Pacific where American
forces once dominated,]{.underline} U.S. officials and experts say[. [In
simulated combat]{.underline}]{.mark} [in which China attempts to invade
Taiwan, the results are sobering and [the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [often loses]{.mark}]{.underline}, said David
Ochmanek, a former senior Defense Department official who helps run war
games for the Pentagon at the RAND Corp. think tank. In tabletop
exercises with America as the \"blue team\" facing off against a \"red
team\" resembling China, [[Taiwan\'s air force is wiped out within
minutes]{.underline}, **[U.S. air bases]{.underline}**]{.mark} [across
the Pacific [come under attack, and American warships]{.mark} and
aircraft [are held at bay]{.mark} by the long reach of China\'s vast
missile arsenal]{.underline}, he said. \"Even when the blue teams in our
simulations and war games intervened in a determined way, they don\'t
always succeed in defeating the invasion,\" Ochmanek said. A war over
Taiwan remains a worst-case scenario that officials say is not imminent.
But China\'s growing military prowess, coupled with its aggressive
rhetoric, is turning Taiwan into a potential flashpoint between Beijing
and Washington --- and a test case for how the U.S. will confront
China\'s superpower ambitions. [The outgoing head of the U.S.
military\'s Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Philip Davidson, warned senators
this month that [the U.S. is losing its **military edge** over
China]{.mark}, and that Beijing [could]{.mark} decide to [try to **seize

## Philippines Add-on

#### Biden focusing on US-Philippine relations.

However, [the [Biden]{.mark} administration [was quick to
**congratulate** the new Philippines' president]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[as it seeks to **counter China's influence** in the
region]{.underline}]{.mark}. Outgoing President Rodrigo Duterte, who
remained widely popular during his term in office, maintained closer
ties with China and Russia, while at times railing against the United
States. [[Marcos]{.mark} has [said]{.mark} in prior interviews that [he
wants his country to have a **better relationship with the
U.S**]{.mark}.]{.underline} but also reiterated that he wants to
maintain a positive relationship with China as well. In a phone call
after his election win, [[Biden]{.mark} also [expressed]{.mark} his
[interest]{.mark} to work with Marcos [on **expanding
relations**]{.mark}]{.underline} between the two countries.

#### However, Marcos Jr. is open to expanding relations with China [now]{.underline} too -- plus this card has impact uniqueness -- [SCS tensions]{.underline} are rising.

**Kurlantzick 6-24** (Joshua Kurlantzick is senior fellow for Southeast
Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). "What Can Be Learned
From Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\'s First Weeks in Office?", Council on Foreign
Relations, June 24, 2022,
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/what-can-be-learned-ferdinand-marcos-jrs-first-weeks-office>",)

[[After winning]{.mark} a massive victory [in the **Philippine
presidential elections**]{.mark} in early May, Ferdinand **[Marcos
Jr]{.mark}**.,]{.underline} who was something of a cipher on the
campaign trail, with few clearly enunciated policy proposals, has begun
to formulate policies, make key appointments, and offer hints of what
his presidency will be like -- at least in the initial stages. For one,
despite predictions by many analysts (including me) that relations
between the Philippines and China had become so toxic in Philippine
public opinion, and the Duterte administration had strategically moved
back toward the United States, [Marcos Jr., [who]{.mark} long
[has]{.mark} had [a close relationship with **Beijing**,]{.mark} [seems
ready to try to again prioritize Philippine-China
ties]{.mark}.]{.underline} [He may prioritize them [even above links to
the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates,]{.underline} which is still
a treaty ally, of course. The United States certainly has wooed Marcos
Jr. intensely, despite the fact that he never disowned his family's past
crimes, or the brutal record of his dictator father. As political
analyst Richard Heydarian notes, despite the fact that Marcos Jr. still
faces a contempt of court charge in the United States, the Biden
administration sent Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman to meet with
Marcos Jr. in Manila, where she said that Marcos Jr. now has immunity
from the former charge, setting the stage in the future for a Marcos Jr.
visit to the White House. (Duterte, who has held strong personal
anti-American views much of his life, never visited the United States as
president, even as he rebuilt strategic ties with Washington later in
his presidency.) And yet [[**Marcos Jr.** already has declared that
**China** is the Philippines' **"strongest
partner,"**]{.underline}]{.mark} a statement that surely angered
[[the]{.mark} Philippine [defense establishment]{.mark}]{.underline},
which has warned of China's growing encroachment in the South China Sea
and [[is generally anti-China and in favor of closer U.S. ties. The
statement also came while tensions were ramping up in the
**S**]{.mark}outh **[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea
again.]{.underline} Whether Marcos Jr. is able to get China to deliver
on more of what it promised Duterte -- more funding for infrastructure
projects that actually get built -- may determine whether he is able to
pull off this move closer to China, or whether public opinion will swell
to even higher anti-Beijing heights, limiting his options with China,
like Duterte in the latter part of his presidency. [Marcos Jr. clearly
intends to turn to China for more economic assistance,]{.underline} but
whether he will get what Duterte did not remains to be seen.

#### Faltering alliances in the region impedes US access to bases -- an investment in Europe projects a lack of follow through in the Asian pacific. 

**Patton 6-1** (Ms. Patton is a research fellow with the Lowy Institute
in Sydney, "Australia., China Is Winning in Asia. Biden's Plans Won't
Change That." New York Times, June 1 2022,
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/01/opinion/us-biden-asia-china-economy-influence.html)

[U.S. officials counter that the plan is more suited to the 21st century
than "past models." But potential [**Asian partners** have trouble
seeing]{.mark} what's in it for them. A lack of
**[buy-in]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[could undermine the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates']{.underline} ability to set the
rules on emerging issues like the digital economy, which would give
American firms a leg up. Meanwhile, China has forged ahead. State-owned
companies have locked up big projects around the region, often under the
umbrella of China's sprawling Belt and Road Initiative. China also
practices persistent diplomacy. Foreign Minister Wang Yi's travels in
Southeast Asia and the Pacific have far outstripped the pace of his U.S.
counterpart, Antony Blinken. Despite the fanfare of Mr. Biden's recent
trip to Asia, it was his first to the region since taking office 16
months ago and included visits only to close allies South Korea and
Japan. [[China]{.mark} also **[cultivates powerful elites. In the
Philippines]{.mark}**, its newly elected president and vice president
have both politically benefited from China's investments in their home
constituencies. In Cambodia and the Solomon Islands, China has opened
pathways for expanding its military presence far from home. In
Indonesia, a strong relationship with the coordinating minister for
maritime affairs and investment gives Beijing the access needed to
pursue objectives]{.underline} such as deals for Huawei in the country's
5G network. The United States does have something China lacks:
time-tested alliances with what the Biden administration calls
"like-minded" democracies such as its fellow members of the "Quad"
grouping --- Japan, Australia and India --- as well as South Korea. The
Quad is meant to demonstrate that the United States and its partners can
provide an alternative to China on, for example, vaccines and
infrastructure. But the Quad has yet to have much real impact. An
ambitious pledge to deliver one billion vaccines to Indo-Pacific
countries by the end of this year has run into manufacturing obstacles
in India. The Quad, in fact, highlights an American weakness: The United
States is strong in the democracies fringing the region but weak at the
center in Southeast Asia. [[Over time, a more dominant China could
**impede U.S. military access to regional bases**]{.mark} [during
crises]{.mark}, pose challenges for American companies doing business
and force U.S. diplomats to work harder to make their voices
heard.]{.underline}

#### Loss of Philippine bases destabilizes the SCS -- escalates.

**Baxter 20** \[Caroline, senior policy analyst at the RAND Corporation,
where she focuses on issues related to operational strategy, base
resiliency, expeditionary warfare, and military readiness. "If U.S.
Forces Have to Leave the Philippines, Then What?", Rand, February 28,
2020.
https://www.rand.org/blog/2020/02/if-us-forces-have-to-leave-the-philippines-then-what.html\]

**[[Without the Philippines]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[U.S. forces would
be]{.mark} faced with a series of math and physics problems]{.underline}
[from [fighting from]{.mark} much [farther away]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The closest military facilities to the South China Sea are in Okinawa
(approximately 1,000 miles), South Korea (1,600 miles), mainland Japan
(2,000 miles), Guam (2,000 miles), and Darwin, Australia (2,300 miles).
Such distances present a number of logistical and operational
complications.

Because [their path would largely take them over open
ocean]{.underline}, forces flowing from Japan or South Korea would not
travel through foreign airspace, allowing for a much straighter and
faster course. [However, they would be coming from---and moving
through---within the range of a sizable Chinese missile
quiver.]{.underline} To reduce that vulnerability, operational planners
might be forced to move the bulk of these units to Guam and Australia.

[[Such great distances produce a]{.mark} heavier [logistical
burden]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially for the Air Force. Fighter jets
would need to be refueled en route more often, giving hostile forces two
prime targets rather than one. **[The Philippines]{.underline}** and
Indonesia also [might deny U.S. forces access to their
airspace]{.underline}, making the route even more circuitous.

More time spent aloft also means planners would run into crew rest
restrictions. Assuming a flying speed of Mach 1.6, an F-35 pilot flying
a sortie from Darwin to the South China Sea would spend a minimum of
four hours in transit round trip, plus the duration of the sortie.
Afterward, that pilot would be out of the fight for at least 10 hours
(PDF) on mandatory rest. Depending on the number of pilots available to
fly and the operational tempo, ten hours can be a long time.

Beyond using Philippine bases as a forward operating location, these
bases allow U.S. forces to preposition resupply materials close to the
fight. Okinawa houses critical resupply materials, such as fuel and
munitions for the Army and Air Force, but 1,000 miles is a long way when
you\'re in need.

Logistical Bottlenecks Surround Taiwan

If Taiwan is the area of operations, some U.S. military facilities are
much closer---but come with serious complications. Okinawa and mainland
Japan are just 450 miles away; South Korea and Guam are 1,300 miles and
1,700 miles away, respectively. (Darwin, at 2,300 miles away is a
less-viable operational hub.) Assuming the bulk of forces come from and
through Japan and South Korea by virtue of proximity, a logistical
bottleneck for all reception, staging, onward movement, and integration
(RSOI) could arise.

The finite number of airfields, ports, and roads, and the rules and
regulations surrounding their use, presents a logistical challenge. For
example, to move large, heavy vehicles on mainland Japan\'s roads, the
U.S. military needs to request permission 45 days in advance and include
proposed routes, the size and weight of each vehicle, and the specific
map to be used. Permission is then granted not by the Ministry of
Defense, but by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and
Tourism. In Okinawa, the Okinawan General Bureau adjudicates such
requests at least 10 days in advance. Similar restrictions exist in
South Korea.

While these restrictions could change during wartime, they would slow
down U.S. force preparations before combat operations begin.

Time and Distance Are an Enemy

[[If the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [were to lose
access to bases in the Philippines]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[the effects
will ripple outward]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [With [fewer options]{.mark}
available, even simply [for staging]{.mark} and prepositioning, heavier
loads will wind up elsewhere]{.underline}. And yet that may be
unacceptable for diplomatic or logistical reasons.

[In the worst-case scenario]{.underline}, in which [U.S. forces have to
flow from the United States to a conflict in the Indo-Pacific
region]{.underline}, time and distance would be as great an enemy as the
adversary itself. Assuming a speed of 22 knots, a ship like the LHA 6,
home-ported in San Diego, would take nine days to get to Tokyo, 12 days
to get to Taiwan, and **[[13 days to get to the South China
Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[This is a slow response time to]{.mark}
what might be [a very rapid conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed, [it
is dangerous to assume that the United States will have an unambiguous
and timely warning of any conflict in the region.]{.underline}

In sum, then: Does the loss of the VFA fundamentally degrade U.S.
operations in the region? No. But could it be the first step towards
that end result? Yes. This is why ensuring a U.S. soldier can train her
counterpart in Manila without a visa also ensures she can also come to
the defense of a U.S. treaty ally. [[Maintaining these alliances in the
Indo-Pacific]{.mark} in all their **manifestations [is
critical]{.mark}**---and the details matter]{.underline}.

[[Chinese military analyzes]{.mark} also [confirm that]{.mark} the
**[war between China and the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates of America
[near]{.mark} the Taiwan Strait and [the South China Sea is likely to
turn into a nuclear war,]{.mark}** emphasizing that in order to change
the course of the war for the losing or defeated party, [the party that
will lose]{.mark} its war with  The other, [may have to compensate
for]{.mark} his [loss]{.mark} and defeat, [by displaying]{.mark} his
[nuclear power]{.mark} and tactical nuclear weapons to strike the
winning side, by using several (tactical nuclear weapons,]{.underline}
that is, using a number of warheads of limited power, but they can
accurately destroy military targets).

[In the event that China succeeds in paralyzing and obstructing the
American military force near the areas of direct Chinese influence,
Washington may respond to China to save its face in front of its people
and other international and regional powers to save Taiwan, for fear of
an invasion by China, through the possibility of (the use of tactical
nuclear weapons]{.underline} by the United States of America against
China's ports, airports, sea and air fleets). This is not just a
baseless analysis without real indications of it, as the [[**US armed
forces** are currently developing **nuclear weapons** to deter China
primarily in]{.mark} Taiwan and [the **S**]{.mark}outh
**[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea [in the event of a war]{.mark}
between them, through the development of Washington for the "cruise
missile" program with nuclear warheads to be (launched by US nuclear
submarines located near the areas of direct Chinese influence), the US
military and its forces in the Indo-Pacific region could use these
nuclear weapons, near China, to achieve an American nuclear military
victory over China.]{.underline}

 According to my analysis of the US-Chinese military scene, according to
the indicators of nuclear power between them, I can understand that
([the outbreak of a war between Washington and Beijing, may turn into a
conflict in the region neighboring China in East and Southeast Asia as a
whole, especially with the support of Washington's allies after
Washington signed "Quad Quartet Agreement" with Australia, Japan, and
India.]{.underline} Besides, the "Aukus Military Defense Nuclear
Submarine Agreement" between Washington, Australia and Britain). [Thus,
[any **US-Chinese conflict** is **likely to spread**]{.mark} across many
regions on several Asian fronts, and here either China or the United
States of America may use their nuclear weapons to snatch victory when
losing the war front.]{.underline}

Taiwan is the most likely flashpoint, but [[**combat could
stretch**]{.mark} out **[as far as the Indian
Ocean.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

I see four distinct maritime "flashpoint" zones, where the Chinese navy
may potentially take military against the U.S. and its allies, partners
and friends. They are [[the Taiwan Strait]{.mark}; Japan and [the East
China Sea;]{.mark} [the South China Sea; and]{.mark} more distant waters
around China\'s other neighbors, including [Indonesia, Singapore,
Australia and India.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The highest regional priority for the Chinese military is ensuring it
can exercise sea control and power projection in the waters around
Taiwan. President Xi Jinping and the Chinese leadership have sworn to
bring the ["renegade
province"](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55851052) to heel. While
they still hope to do so through patience --- and by strangling
Taipei's [international
support](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-14/beijing-is-out-to-convince-the-world-that-taiwan-is-not-worth-dying-for) ---
they will be willing to use military force if necessary. [In recent
congressional [testimony](https://news.usni.org/2021/03/09/davidson-china-could-try-to-take-control-of-taiwan-in-next-six-years),
Admiral Phil Davidson, [head of the Pentagon's Indo-Pacific Command,
said that he saw the possibility of military action **"within six
years."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

With Taiwan over 8,000 miles from Hawaii but around 100 miles from the
Chinese mainland, the challenges for the U.S. Navy are profound. [[U.S.
support for Taiwan]{.mark}'s []{.mark}security [is bipartisan]{.mark}
--- [but the longstanding U.S. policy of "strategic ambiguity,"]{.mark}
supporting Taiwan militarily without a formal commitment to defending
it, [is dangerously fuzzy. It could lead to a miscalculation by the
Chinese]{.mark} (or the Taiwanese) [and set off a larger
conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[China and Japan both claim]{.mark} a group of [islands in the East
China Sea]{.mark}]{.underline} known as the Senkaku in Japanese and the
Diaoyu in Chinese. Located close to Taiwan, these five uninhabited
islands are important because ownership provides a 200-nautical-mile
exclusion zone and buttresses competing claims around them. They are
part of the chain descending south from the Japanese main islands, and
form a gateway to the South China Sea. Ownership would also provide
fishing rights, access to
exploit [hydrocarbons](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2020/08/19/china-is-probing-japans-aerial-defenses-over-the-disputed-senkaku-islands/?sh=6be0e20a7dab),
and the possibility of deep-seabed mining.

[[The U.S. recognizes the islands as]{.mark} part of [Japan,]{.mark}
thus [**a Chinese move to occupy**]{.mark} them **[would activate the
U.S.-Japan]{.mark}** mutual **[defense treaty]{.mark}**, something
successive American [presidential
administrations](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42761.pdf) have made
clear.]{.underline}

Alongside all those maritime silhouettes[, [you will]{.mark} also
[see]{.mark} the [warships of many nations]{.mark} --- [China and the
U.S]{.mark}., to be sure, but also local combatants from [Vietnam, the
Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.]{.mark} Other
Asia-Pacific nations, including [Australia, New Zealand, Japan, India
and South Korea, maintain a military presence]{.mark}. And [warships
from]{.mark} other side of the world --- [France, Germany, the U.K. ---
routinely deploy there as well.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Today, [India is cornerstone of an emerging]{.mark} Indo-Pacific
[geopolitical alignment, known as]{.mark} colloquially as [[the
Quad](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-19/indo-pacific-quad-alliance-must-do-more-than-balance-china),
along with Australia, Japan and the U.S.]{.mark} One of Biden's first
actions after taking office was a video summit with the other three
nations' leaders.]{.underline}

[If so, how would India respond? [While not treaty allies, Washington
and]{.mark} New [Delhi are drawing]{.mark} closer [together. India's
relations with China are deteriorating]{.mark}]{.underline}, with recent
clashes over disputed Himalayan borders[. If India were to join with the
other Quad nations, [it would mean war at sea in the Indian

### Philippines \-\-- Bases Deter

#### Bases Deter -- empirics

14, 2022,
https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/04/strategies-behind-china-and-the-asia-pacifics-military-base-construction/)

At the turn of the new millennium, [[most Asia-Pacific countries had
hoped that codes of
conduct](https://www.fpri.org/article/2020/10/uncertain-prospects-south-china-sea-code-of-conduct-negotiations/),
greater trade, and tighter economic integration would obviate China's
motivation to build or expand its military bases.]{.underline} That has
not turned out to be the case. Thus, one by one, countries across the
Asia-Pacific have come to reassess their needs for military bases. The
types of bases built since the late 2000s signal three distinct
strategies. [First is [a strategy of **limited deterrence**]{.mark}, the
intent of which is [to prevent Chinese forces from operating]{.mark}
with complete impunity, rather than to thwart them. Vietnam was the
first to employ this approach.]{.underline} In the late 2000s, it
overhauled its Cam Ranh Bay naval base. It then offered the use of the
base's modernized facilities to foreign navies, including those of
India, Japan, and the United States. By the late 2010s, it had become
home to the backbone of the Vietnamese navy: six new Project 636.3
(Kilo-class) diesel-electric attack submarines. Malaysia followed by
building a new naval base for its two Scorpene-class diesel-electric
attack submarines at Sepanggar Bay on Borneo, near the South China Sea,
in 2008. [A half decade later, Kuala Lumpur built [a]{.mark} second
[naval base]{.mark} at Bintulu, also on Borneo, [to monitor China's
growing maritime presence]{.mark} off its coast.]{.underline} Malaysia
expanded the base with an airfield in 2022. Getting off to a later start
were Indonesia and the Philippines. It was not until 2014 [that Jakarta
expanded its Pontianak naval base on Borneo]{.underline}. Then in 2021,
after lengthy preparations[, Jakarta broke ground on a new base on
Natuna Island for three of its planned diesel-electric attack
submarines]{.underline}. Similarly, [[Manila began to expand its naval
facilities]{.mark} at Oyster Bay on Palawan Island, [adjacent to
the]{.mark} **[S]{.mark}**outh **[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea, in
2014]{.underline}. Six years later, it selected a site at Subic Bay on
Luzon Island for a new base that will house [its revitalized
navy](https://www.fpri.org/article/2019/10/building-from-scratch-rebirth-of-the-philippine-navy/),
including two or three planned diesel-electric attack submarines. It
also expects to construct an air base nearby for its new F/A-50 jet
fighter-trainers. And, since the mid-2010s, Vietnam has built, and the
Philippines will soon build, bases for mobile anti-ship missile
batteries along their respective South China Sea coasts[**.** The
**[bases will enable]{.mark} the two [countries to project]{.mark}
modern [firepower]{.mark}** [into the disputed
region]{.mark}.]{.underline} To the north, [[Japan began building new
military bases]{.mark} at about the same time.]{.underline} But unlike
the strategy behind Southeast Asia's bases, Japan's bases suggested a
strategy [whose intention was [to]{.mark} not only fully deter China
from seizing the Senkaku Islands, but also [frustrate China's]{.mark}
wider [naval ambitions]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2014, Tokyo set up a
coastal observation base on Yonaguni Island, near the disputed islands.
Soon after, it began preparations to construct [new bases with anti-ship
missile batteries on several Ryukyu
Islands](https://www.fpri.org/article/2021/02/the-ryukyu-defense-line-japans-response-to-chinas-naval-push-into-the-pacific-ocean/),
which run from the Japanese mainland to Yonaguni Island[. The first base
was built on Amami Ōshima Island. It was armed with a Type 12 anti-ship
missile battery and defended by a Type 03 surface-to-air missile
battery.]{.underline} Tokyo then built similar bases on Miyako Island in
2020 and Ishigaki Island in 2022. The missile bases cover the disputed
Senkaku Islands as well as all the transit points for the Chinese navy
into the Pacific Ocean, including the Miyako Strait. Finally, further
out into the Pacific Ocean, the United States has started to seriously
reconsider its basing requirements. [Having pulled back much of its
forces in Asia (including those in South Korea) to military bases on
Okinawa and mainland Japan after the Cold War, Washington grew
increasingly worried about their safety from Chinese ballistic missile
attack during the
2010s.]{.underline}[[\[4\]]{.underline}](https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/04/strategies-behind-china-and-the-asia-pacifics-military-base-construction/#_ftn4)

American military bases on Guam seem vulnerable too. Hence,
[[the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [has]{.mark} been
gradually shifting from a strategy of forward deployment to one of
dispersion and redundancy.]{.underline} In 2018, Washington arranged a
more-or-less permanent American presence in Darwin at the northern tip
of Australia. Then, in 2020, [the United States [opened]{.mark}
[negotiations]{.mark} with a welcoming Palau [for a **possible new
base**]{.mark} **there**.]{.underline} And, given America's need to
secure its sea lanes of communications across the Pacific Ocean, it was
no surprise that it also decided to reopen its embassy in the Solomon
Islands in 2022.

### Philippines \-\-- AT: Deterrence Fails

#### China will move onto the South China Sea if it perceives the US as being weak there

**Kaplan, '14** (Robert Kaplan graduated with a B.A. in political
science from University of Washington in 1966. He's a lawyer in Seattle
who has served on numerous nonprofit boards and community organizations.

pro-bono work. "Asia's Cauldron: The South China Sea and the End of a
Stable Pacific," Random House, 03/25/14, pg. 27-30)

"Plan B is the U.S. Navy---Pacific Command. But we will publicly remain
neutral in any U.S.-China dispute." To make certain that I got the
message, this official said: ["[An American military presence is needed
to countervail China]{.mark}, but we won't vocalize that." **[The
withdrawal of even one U.S. aircraft carrier]{.mark}** strike group
[**from the**]{.mark} Western **[Pacific is a "game
changer."]{.mark}**]{.underline}

China, by way of its 1,500 short-range ballistic missiles focused on
Taiwan and its 270 commercial flights a week to Taiwan, will be able to
do an end run around Taiwanese sovereignty without needing to subdue it
through a naval invasion. As with the closing of the American frontier,
China's effective capture of Taiwan in the years to come will allow
Chinese naval planners the ability to finally concentrate their energies
on the wider South China Sea, an antechamber to the Indian Ocean in
which China also desires a naval presence, in order to protect its
Middle Eastern energy supplies. [[Were China to ever replace the U.S.
Navy as the dominant power in the **S**]{.mark}outh **[C]{.mark}**hina
**[S]{.mark}**ea[--- or even reach parity with it---this would open up
geostrategic possibilities for China]{.mark} comparable to what America
achieved upon its dominance of the Caribbean.]{.underline}

The U.S. Navy presently dominates the South China Sea. But that
situation will change. The size of the U.S. Navy has come down from
almost six hundred warships in the Reagan era, to the mid-three hundreds
during the Clinton era, to under three hundred now. It might go lower
still by the 2020s, because of the retirement of current classes of
submarines and surface warships, cost overruns, and future budget cuts,
the result in turn of massive fiscal deficits. Meanwhile, the Chinese
navy, the world's second most powerful naval service, is growing rather
dramatically. Rather than purchase warships across the board, China is
developing niche capacities in subsurface warfare and ballistic missile
technology (the DF-21 missile) designed to hit moving targets at sea,
such as a U.S. aircraft carrier. [[If China expands its submarine fleet
to 78 by 2020 as planned, it will be on par with the U.S. Navy's
undersea fleet]{.mark} in quantity. 12 While the U.S. Navy's submarine
fleet is completely nuclear, it requires that feature to sail halfway
around the world, in order to get to East Asia in the first place, even
as China's diesel-electric submarines are supremely quiet and can hide
better, therefore, in the congested littorals of East Asia. [At some
point, China is likely to, in effect, be able to deny the U.S. Navy
unimpeded access to parts of the **S**]{.mark}outh **[C]{.mark}**hina

[[Leveraging the]{.mark} latent [potential of U.S., allied]{.mark}, and

a change of mindset in how the Philippines frames its defense and
security policies. The former concedes all initiative to China and puts
the Philippines in a position where it may be forced to compromise on
its interests. This was demonstrated by [Chinese aggression against
Philippine
vessels](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/811345/2-philippine-boats-en-route-to-ayungin-blocked-water-cannoned-by-chinese-ships-locsin/story/)

in this task[. A "theory of victory" comprises coherent ideas that guide
the Philippines in utilizing its defense resources to achieve the
desired conditions]{.underline}, whether that is preserving Philippine
holdings in the disputed sea, deterring coercive actions against
Philippine vessels and citizens in the waters of the West Philippine

also delivered Global Hawk UAVs to Japan earlier this year. And
Singapore has placed orders for F-35 fighters expected to be delivered
in 2026. Some of these U.S. defense stocks have surged since the start
of Russia's unprovoked war on Ukraine. Raytheon shares are 5% higher
since Feb. 24, while Lockheed Martin stocks are up around 12% and
Northrop Grumman is higher by around 11%. In comparison, the S&P 500
index is down over 2% in the same period. Tian also referred to the
threat North Korea poses to the region and the world. "North Korea is
testing and developing nuclear weapons, which of course is a greater
concern to not only the region but the world as a whole," he said. [Tian

the Shangri-La Dialogue that China was causing instability with its
claim to the self-governing island of Taiwan and its increased military
activity in the area. [Austin had stressed the need for multilateral
partnerships with nations in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}, which [Wei
suggested was an attempt to back China into a corner.]{.underline} \"No
country should impose its will on others or bully others under the guise
of multilateralism,\" he said. \" The strategy is an attempt to build an
exclusive small group in the name of a free and open Indo-Pacific to

year U.S. officials accused China of testing a hypersonic missile, a
weapon harder for missile defense systems to counter, but China insisted
it had been a \"routine test of a spacecraft.\" Answering a question
about the test on Sunday, Wei came the closest so far to acknowledging
it was, indeed, a hypersonic missile, saying, \"As for hypersonic
weapons, many countries are developing weapons and I think there\'s no
surprise that China is doing so.\" \"China will develop its military,\"
he added. \"I think it\'s natural.\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony
Blinken last month said China represented the \"most serious long-term

[[In Asia]{.mark}'s maritime heartland, [all the ingredients of a global

peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline}

In many ways, the South China Sea disputes are today's version of the
early 20th century Balkans, where "some damned foolish thing" can
trigger a devastating global conflict without precedence and beyond our
wildest imagination. It is here in Asia's maritime heartland, where all
the ingredients of a global cataclysm are conspiring against the
post-Cold War period of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific[.
[It's]{.mark} also [here where]{.mark} the naked edge of [China's
hegemonic ambitions are on full display, with dire consequences
for]{.mark} smaller [neighbors and]{.mark} the broader [**liberal
international order**.]{.mark} Here lies the defining geopolitical
dilemma of our times.]{.underline}

[[Today's China is too big to be "contained,"]{.mark} a la George F.
Kennan's antidote to the Soviet threat, but it's also becoming too
voracious to be left to its own devices. If there is one thing that
history teaches us, it is that neither strategic fatalism, which would
risk turning the South China Sea into a Chinse lake, nor a reckless
superpower rivalry, which could spark a global conflict, is
advisable.]{.underline} So, how should we deal with the most powerful
communist regime of all time? Or, as Vladimir Lenin once put it, "What
is to be done?"

[[To prevent China's]{.mark} prospective [domination of a main artery of
global trade]{.mark}, [what's necessary is]{.mark} nothing less than [a
multilateral]{.mark} "Goldilocks" [approach,]{.mark}]{.underline} which
checks Beijing's worst instincts through an optimal combination of
engagement and deterrence. Here, what is needed is a "constrainment"
strategy, whereby like-minded powers and China's besieged neighbors
should collectively deploy a combination of diplomatic, economic, and
military countermeasures to uphold a free and open order in the world's
most dynamic region.

on how to deal with China.]{.underline} The Pentagon has increased
investments in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence,
and cyber- and space-based systems to prepare for a possible high-tech
conflict with China in the 2030s. But the balance of power is likely to
shift decidedly in China's favor by the time they are deployed unless
the United States brings new resources to the table soon. President
Biden this year submitted the largest defense budget ever in dollar
terms, but much of the increase will be swallowed up by skyrocketing
inflation. [Mr. [Biden]{.mark}, like former President Donald Trump,
[is]{.mark} thus [falling short of]{.mark} a target of 3 percent to 5
percent real annual **[budget growth]{.mark}**, a bipartisan goal set

U.S. military is globally dispersed, China can concentrate its forces on
winning a future conflict in its own neighborhood. It now has the
capability. [China has the world's largest navy and Asia's biggest air
force and an imposing arsenal of missiles designed to deter the United
States from projecting military power into the Western Pacific in a
crisis.]{.underline} China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier is
nearing completion, and other new hardware is being developed or is
already in service. Beijing is also raising alarm with its readiness to
project that strength. While much attention is focused on its behavior
toward Taiwan, China is building and militarizing artificial islands in
the South China Sea. It also broke ground on an expanded naval port in
Cambodia last week, which may one day provide its first military
foothold in another Asian country. A security agreement with the Solomon
Islands could lead to something similar, and Beijing is aggressively
courting other Pacific nations. America's military position in Asia, by
contrast, has been hampered by decades of preoccupation with Middle East
conflicts. [[The war in Ukraine has morphed into a **long-term \$54

Afghanistan, but that has not freed up many resources for the
Indo-Pacific. Washington must not lose sight of the fact that China is a
far greater security threat than Russia, now and in the long term.

on the United States armed forces on guard against China,]{.underline}
which has the world's second-largest economy and a rapidly growing
military, both in numbers and in top-notch technology. "One of the
things that (China's) doing is seeking to undermine the rules-based
international order that we adhere to, that we believe in, that we
helped build," said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. "And if
China's challenging it in one way or another, we will stand up to that."
China has yet to condemn Russia's four-month long war against Ukraine
and has criticized sanctions brought against Moscow by NATO members. A
year ago, Russia and China extended a friendship treaty promising even
more "strategic cooperation" in defending their common interests. That
was followed up in November with an agreement to strengthen their
military ties. Weeks before Russia's February invasion, Chinese leader
Xi Jinping hosted his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin for a summit at
which they pledged a partnership that had "no limits." [[Western leaders
are concerned that **Russia's aggression** in Ukraine could **embolden
China**]{.mark} to be more assertive over Taiwan.]{.underline} China
considers Taiwan a part of its territory with no right to independent
recognition as a state or representation on the world stage. Speaking at
an event in Madrid that was not part of the NATO summit, [British
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said that unless China is checked "there is
a real risk that they draw the wrong idea which results in a
catastrophic miscalculation such as invading Taiwan,"]{.underline}
referring to the self-governing island that [China]{.underline} claims
as a province. However, in a move interpreted to show it was somewhat
uneasy over the war in Ukraine, China voted to abstain in a United
Nations motion to demand Russia halt its attack. China has greatly
increased its diplomatic reach via foreign investment, above all in
central Asia and Africa. Now it [is seeking to match that with greater
military might, especially in the South China Sea where it has built
bases on disputed islands.]{.underline} The U.S. navy has pushed back by
conducting drills in those waters.

[President [Biden embarked Thursday on his first diplomatic mission to
Asia]{.mark} since taking office]{.underline}, hoping [t[o demonstrate
that the **U**]{.mark}nited [**S**]{.mark}tates [remained focused on
countering China]{.mark}]{.underline}, even as his administration
stage-managed a war against Russia in Europe. With his original strategy
of pivoting foreign policy attention to Asia effectively blown up by
Russia's invasion of Ukraine[, Mr. [Biden]{.mark} has now [shifted to
the argument that **there can be no trade-off** between Europe and
Asia]{.mark}]{.underline} and that only the United States can bring
together the democracies of the East and West to stand up to autocracy
and aggression in both spheres. For Mr. Biden, finding his balance
between the twin imperatives will require geopolitical maneuvering that
would challenge any president. The competing demands on his time and
attention were on display on Thursday as he squeezed in a last-minute
meeting at the White House with the leaders of Sweden and Finland to
welcome their decisions to join NATO before heading to Joint Base
Andrews to board Air Force One for the long flight to South Korea. [And
days before that, Mr. Biden hosted Southeast Asian nations at the White
House]{.underline} to detail new investments in clean energy and
maritime assets, part of [an effort to prevent China from dominating the
Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} "We are preparing for all contingencies,
including the possibility that such a provocation would occur while we
are in Korea or in Japan," Jake Sullivan, the president's national
security adviser, told reporters this week before Mr. Biden departed
Washington. Mr. Sullivan has consulted his counterpart in China in
recent days to discuss, among other things, the prospect of a North
Korean provocation. [Mr. [Biden's trip is also aimed at **reassuring
allies** in the region who were rattled by]{.mark} President Donald J.
[Trump's]{.mark} unorthodox [approach to Asia in recent
years]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Mr. Trump pulled the United States
out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an American-negotiated regional
trade pact meant to counter China's growing economic sway]{.underline}.
He repeatedly questioned American troop commitments to South Korea and
the mutual defense agreement with Japan, while engaging in what he
called a "love affair" with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Bruce Klingner, a
longtime C.I.A. analyst on Asia now at the Heritage Foundation, said
South Korea and Japan were increasingly nervous about North Korea's
capabilities and Mr. Trump's threats to pull back from the region.
"Biden should provide unequivocal assurances of U.S. dedication to the
defense of our allies and affirm the U.S. extended deterrence guarantee
of nuclear, conventional and missile defense forces," he said. A couple
of recent studies have concluded that even though American political
influence in the region has risen again with Mr. Trump leaving power,
[the United States has continued to lose economic influence because of
the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership]{.underline}. "The
biggest criticism of the administration in Asia right now is they have
no economic strategy and they're ceding the field to China," said
Michael J. Green, the incoming chief executive of the United States
Studies Centre in Australia and a former Asia adviser to President
George W. Bush. To address that[, Mr. Biden plans to unveil a new
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which is a pale shadow of a full-scale
trade pact but will outline various mutual priorities like digital trade
and supply chain security.]{.underline} American officials hope it will
be joined by many of the countries still in the Trans-Pacific
Partnership. [Mr. Green called that an important first step but one that
behind the scenes, the Japanese, Australians and others find inadequate
for the moment]{.underline} --- although they are unlikely to say so
publicly. "A lot of their interest is to show the U.S. is back and China
is not going to write the economic rules," Mr. Green said. Matthew P.
Goodman, senior vice president for economics at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, said that if the Biden administration did not
offer greater access to the American market, nations in the region would
be looking for direct funding to expand infrastructure and the digital
economy. "I think a lot of partners are going to look at that list and
say: That's a good list of issues. I'm happy to be involved," said Mr.
Goodman. "But, you know, are we going to get any tangible benefits out
of participating in this framework?" In crafting the economic framework,
Biden administration officials have focused in part on labor and
environmental standards. But without the benefits of lowered trade
barriers, other countries may be reluctant to make costly commitments.
"The bottom line is the United States is not coming to the table with
market access," said Sheila A. Smith, a senior fellow for Asia-Pacific
studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. "And that's the trade
piece. That's what the region is looking for." During stops in Seoul and
Tokyo, Mr. Biden will encounter two new partners who are both seen as
more aligned with American priorities and likely to have good chemistry
with the president, according to Mr. Green and other analysts and
officials. The first, President Yoon Suk-yeol of South Korea, was
inaugurated on May 10 and has taken a stronger approach to China and
North Korea than his predecessor, while the second, Prime Minister Fumio
Kishida of Japan, was elected just last October and enjoys a level of
popularity that is likely to keep him in office for the duration of Mr.
Biden's term, unlike the frequent revolving-door governments in Tokyo.
"Inevitably North Korea is going to make itself front and center as part
of the agenda for a Biden-Yoon summit," said Scott A. Snyder, the
director of U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. "Just
the fact that that speculation is out there makes it necessary for the
two leaders to talk about extended deterrence, how that works, and to
try to deepen their shared commitment to security and defense." [While
in Tokyo, Mr. [Biden will also meet]{.mark} with other leaders of the
so-called Quad --- the United States, [Japan, Australia and
India]{.mark} --- his second time [sitting down with his counterparts in
a bloc meant to resist Chinese hegemony in the
region]{.mark}.]{.underline} With Australian elections scheduled for
Saturday, it remained unclear who would attend the meeting, on Tuesday.
But the most complicating factor may be how Mr. Biden approaches Prime
Minister Narendra Modi of India, who has been hesitant to condemn
Russia's invasion of Ukraine out of fear of undermining security ties
with Moscow. Moreover, Mr. Biden's promise to combat autocracies around
the world will be put to the test with Mr. Modi, who has marginalized
and maligned minority Muslims. But the president's aides said he can
press the international campaign to thwart Russian aggression while
still navigating the diplomatic complexities of the Asian-Pacific region
and reaffirming America's role in this part of the world. "He remains
focused on ensuring that our efforts in those missions are successful,"
said Mr. Sullivan, "but he also intends to seize this moment, this
pivotal moment, to assert bold and confident American leadership in
another vital region of the world."

[Two years ago, in what would be his first major speech on Taiwan,
Chinese President [Xi Jinping warned that Taiwan's reunification was
inevitable]{.mark}, saying that "we make no promise to renounce the use
of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary
means"]{.underline} and that "Taiwan's independence goes against the
trend of history and will lead to a dead end". Earlier this week,
[Taiwan's Defence Minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, said [that military tensions
between China and Taiwan are at their highest]{.mark} in four decades,
warning that [Beijing will]{.mark} be in a position to [launch a]{.mark}
full-scale [invasion in 2025]{.mark}.]{.underline} "For the military,
the current situation is the grimmest in the more than 40 years since I
joined the service," he told Parliament. "It is capable now, but it has
to calculate what it would cost, and what kind of outcome it wishes to
achieve." He warned that even a single "miscalculation" or "slight
carelessness" could spark a full-blown crisis. While nearly the entire
academic field of international relations has long predicted war between
a rising China and a declining US is inevitable because great-power war
typically occurs at the "intersection of one hegemon's rise and
another's decline" -- otherwise known as Thucydides Trap -- a growing
chorus of security elites are arguing an inverse of this theory. "The
United States needs to prepare for a major war, not because its rival is
rising but because of the opposite," argue Hal Brands, a resident
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and Michael Beckley,
associate professor of political science at Tufts University. Drawing
comparisons between Nazi Japan and Imperial Japan in the lead-up to the
Second World War, they argue that [[China is reaching its most
threatening point now]{.mark} because its economy and military
production capacity has peaked at the same time that it is being
increasingly shunned, condemned and isolated]{.underline}, as a result
of its mishandling and cover-up of the Coronavirus pandemic outbreak,
its persecution of its ethnic Uyghur minority, and aggressive military
expansionism in the South China Sea and Himalayas. The recent
multi-trillion-dollar collapse of property developer Evergrande, and the
more recent billion-dollar collapse of another, Fantasia Holdings Group,
reveals an economy drowning in a culmination of years of bad debt, poor
decisions, corruption and negligence. These realities could force
Beijing to take on a "now or never mentality... and grab what it can
before it's too late", warn Brand and Beckley, who argue that "the most
dangerous trajectory in world politics is a long rise followed by the
prospect of a sharp decline". Adding further humiliation to President Xi
Jinping's leadership was the unexpected but crushing defeat of the
pro-China KMT party in last year's Taiwanese presidential election. [For
all of these reasons, the US, along with the UK Australia, Japan and
India are behaving in a manner that suggests their respective [military
leaders believe that war in the Taiwan Strait]{.mark}, and/or elsewhere
in Indo Pacific [is inevitable]{.mark}]{.underline} within the next
decade, with the recent establishment of actual and would-be security
alliances -- AUKUS and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Their
collective beliefs and actions were vindicated by comments delivered in
Chinese state media on Thursday, warning that the threat of war is
"real" and that it "may be triggered at any time". [Ultimately[, there
are very few reasons to believe]{.mark} that a US-China [war over Taiwan
won't materialise within this decade]{.mark}]{.underline} or the next --
making the breakaway and sovereign island state arguably the most
pivotal in international politics for the foreseeable future.

#### China plans to attack this fall

Planned Taiwan Invasion in Fall, Alleged Russian Intel Leak Claims,"

Taiwan\'s top diplomat said he couldn\'t speak on the authenticity of a
purported [Russian intelligence document that claimed Chinese President
[Xi]{.mark} Jinping had [plans to annex]{.mark} the island nation
**[this fall]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [[Joseph Wu]{.mark}, Taiwan\'s
minister of foreign affairs, [said]{.mark}]{.underline} on Wednesday
that his country would have to prepare regardless. \"[No
matter]{.underline} if or [[**when** China decides to attack us]{.mark},
[we must]{.mark} always [be ready to defend
ourselves]{.mark},\"]{.underline} he told reporters in Taipei. During a
defense committee hearing in the island\'s legislature, [Wu told
lawmakers that [he was aware]{.mark} of media reports about [the
document]{.mark} said to be [written by an]{.mark} anonymous [analyst
with Russia\'s Federal Security Service]{.mark} calling themself [\"Wind
of Change.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} The foreign minister said he wasn\'t
able to verify the alleged FSB document, but said Taiwan\'s own
intelligence services were closely monitoring relevant chatter. [The
letter in question is part of [a series published by]{.mark}
France-based Russian dissident Vladimir Osechkin, [a human rights
lawyer]{.mark} who runs []{.mark}gulagu-net.ru, a website documenting
abuses in Russian jails. Osechkin claims to have received seven letters
since Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline} The FSB whistleblower
has painted a detailed picture of fear and chaos inside Russia\'s
principal intelligence service, where apparently none but a select few
were aware of Putin\'s plans. Christo Grozev, the executive director of
investigative journalism group Bellingcat, said earlier this month that
his FSB contacts believe the whistleblower to be authentic, even if they
didn\'t agree with the conclusions of his analysis. In the fourth letter
to Osechkin, dated March 9, the author describes the difficult position
in which Moscow has put Beijing because of Putin\'s decision to invade
Ukraine, a move that united the West and turned Russia into such a
pariah that China would find it hard to offer support. \"Because of the
war, Russia has such a negative image for a number of countries that the
United States can easily push sanctions against China, at least with the
Europeans, if it risks circumventing the sanctions on Russia,\" the
letter read. \"China depends on exports so much that, coupled with its
dependence on commodity prices...this would be almost a fatal blow.\"
The whistleblower continued: [\"Not only that[: Xi Jinping was]{.mark}
at least [tentatively considering the capture of Taiwan in the
autumn---he needs]{.mark} his own small [victory]{.mark} in order [to be
re-elected]{.mark} for a third term---there is a colossal power struggle
among the \[party\] elite. Now, after the events in Ukraine, this window
of opportunity has shut, which gives the United States the opportunity
to both blackmail Xi and negotiate with his \[political\] rivals on
favorable terms.\"]{.underline}

#### Xi will invade -- re-election

While China has been able to make great technological strides of its own
in recent years, what has really helped its advancement is its access to
Western innovations. During President Xi's next two terms, that access
is likely to be significantly restricted. Once China can no longer
easily use and copy American, European and Japanese tech to boost its
own industries, the government will need to find ways other than
increasing productivity to raise revenue -- for example by increasing
taxes. The tax burden in China is already hefty, and adding to the
weight will likely hurt the poor more than benefit them. Unlike his
predecessor Hu Jintao, President [[Xi]{.mark} is an ambitious man who
[constantly feels the need to demonstrate his infallibility.]{.mark}
This desire is not only in his nature, but is dictated by the immense
pressure he is under -- and the more he centralizes power in his own
hands, the greater that pressure becomes. [Once]{.mark} President [Xi is
"reelected,"]{.mark} the [uncertainties regarding]{.mark} China's
[economy and foreign policy will multiply]{.mark}. [If]{.mark} the
[economy falters,]{.mark} he will want to draw the country's attention
to other issues -- [Taiwan is the low-hanging fruit]{.mark}
here.]{.underline} For at least the next three years, however, retaking
Taiwan by force will prove too costly for China. On the other hand,
[[Beijing could achieve]{.mark} two [goals by taking Pratas Island
first,]{.mark} which is currently [occupied by
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} That type of operation would allow
China to flex its military muscle vis-a-vis Taiwan, while potentially
deterring neighbors or Western nations from pushing too hard against its
claims in the South China Sea. [At the same time, [Beijing will]{.mark}
further [intensify its pressure]{.mark} on Taipei [by
blacklisting]{.mark} prominent [figures and institutions]{.mark} it sees
as [favoring Taiwanese independence, hoping to strong-arm the island
into compliance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} long
[played]{.mark} [a key role]{.mark} [in the]{.mark} [territorial
dispute]{.mark}. [It]{.mark} initially [signed a]{.mark} bilateral
[defense agreement with Taiwan in 1954]{.mark} [and]{.mark} over the
years [supplied the island with armaments]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even
[after recognizing the Chinese Communist government in Beijing in 1979,
the U.S. has adhered to position of "strategic ambiguity" when it comes
to]{.underline} the question of [an American response to a Chinese
attack on Taiwan.]{.underline} But today, with U.S.-Chinese relations at
one of the lowest points in recent memory---and as the Chinese military
takes increasingly provocative military actions toward Taiwan---the
fears of war have increased. So, too, have the calls for the U.S. to
ratchet up its efforts to defend Taiwan, including the potential use of
military force. The flames have been fanned by a host of military
figures and foreign policy pundits. Admiral Philip Davidson, commander
of U.S. military forces in the Pacific, got the party started last March
when he warned a Senate committee that China could invade Taiwan "in the
next six years.". Writing in *The Wall Street Journal,* former Trump
Defense official Elbridge Colby [ramped up the threat-mongering by
declaring](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fight-for-taiwan-could-come-soon-china-navy-defense-11635349097), "Beijing
has made clear it is willing to use force to take Taiwan.... And this
isn't mere talk. The Chinese military has rehearsed amphibious attacks,
and commercial satellite imagery shows that China practices large-scale
attacks on U.S. forces in the region." In the Bible of the foreign
policy establishment, *Foreign Affairs,* Orianna Skylar Mastro, a fellow
at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International
Studies, [warned](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-06-03/china-taiwan-war-temptation) that
"whereas Chinese leaders used to view a military campaign to take the
island as a fantasy, now they consider it a real possibility."
Yes, [China could invade
Taiwan](https://www.heritage.org/asia/commentary/yes-china-could-invade-taiwan),
says the Heritage Foundation. And Taiwan's top defense
official---perhaps not surprisingly---warned recently that China will be
able to mount [a "full-scale" invasion of
Taiwan](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/06/asia/taiwan-defense-minister-china-attack-intl-hnk/index.html) by
2025.Some U.S. policymakers have taken these warnings to heart.
[Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton has called for the U.S. to end its policy
of "strategic ambiguity" and make clear its willingness to defend Taiwan
against a Chinese invasion.]{.underline} Former U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations Nikki Haley warned recently that "if China takes control
of Taiwan, Beijing will be emboldened to seize other territories around
the globe" and called on the U.S. to increase pressure on China,
including a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics scheduled to be held in
Beijing. [But how legitimate are these fears? [Is the]{.mark} prospect
of a [Chinese invasion of Taiwan a]{.mark} serious and [urgent
concern?]{.mark} The answer is ["not very."]{.mark}]{.underline} And
it's a view, ironically, endorsed by the Pentagon. Earlier this month,
the Defense Department released its annual report to Congress on
"Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of
China." While the report lays out the ways in which [[China's
"P]{.mark}eople's [L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy"]{.underline} is
seeking to modernize its forces, the [[threat to Taiwan of]{.mark} armed
[invasion]{.mark} [is]{.mark} still [minimal at best]{.mark}:
[Large-scale]{.mark} amphibious [invasion]{.mark} [is]{.mark} one of the
most [complicated and difficult]{.mark} military operations, requiring
air and maritime superiority, the rapid buildup and sustainment of
supplies onshore, and uninterrupted support.]{.underline} An attempt to
invade Taiwan would likely strain PRC's armed forces and invite
international intervention. These stresses, combined with the PRC's
combat force attrition and the complexity of urban warfare and
counterinsurgency, even assuming a successful landing and breakout, make
an amphibious invasion of Taiwan a significant political and military
risk. One might expect that a country intent on launching the largest
and most difficult amphibious invasion in history would be making
intense preparations. That's not happening. As the Pentagon report
notes, Chinese naval investments have focused on building up the
capacity to launch "regional and eventually global expeditionary
missions rather than the large number of landing ship transports and
medium landing craft that would be necessary for a large-scale direct
beach assault." The Pentagon also finds that while China is focusing on
conducting joint operations that involve forces from the army, navy, and
air force, as of present it currently lacks such capabilities. The
soldiers and officers who make up China's military today have virtually
no direct combat experience. That the Chinese military enjoys vast
military superiority vis-à-vis Taiwan is not in doubt. But that such
resources can be used to mount an amphibious assault is something else
altogether. The Chinese military last fought a war in 1979 against
Vietnam, and the PLA was badly bloodied. That means that the soldiers
and officers who make up China's military today have virtually no direct
combat experience. China's own media outlets have, according to [[the
Pentagon, noted the PLA's shortcomings]{.mark}, which [include
that]{.mark} "[commanders]{.mark} [can]{.mark}no[t]{.mark} (1) judge
situations; (2) understand higher authorities' intentions; (3) [make
operational decisions]{.mark}; (4) [deploy forces;]{.mark} and, (5)
[manage]{.mark} unexpected [situations]{.mark}."]{.underline} These
problems would be challenging enough in a conventional conflict. For
[a]{.underline} complex invasion of Taiwan, they would render such
efforts virtually impossible. One [big reason is that Taiwan is about as
inhospitable an environment as can be imagined for an amphibious
invasion.]{.underline} Ian Easton, a defense expert who has written
extensively about Taiwan defense strategy, wrote earlier this year that
the country's "coastal terrain ... is a defender's dream come true.
Taiwan has only 14 small invasion beaches, and they are bordered by
cliffs and urban jungles." Easton also notes that "many of Taiwan's
outer islands bristle with missiles, rockets, and artillery guns. Their
granite hills have been honeycombed with tunnels and bunker systems."

[China has parked its fishing fleet in waters claimed by the
Philippines. Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte has fulminated
ineffectively. So far, at least, the [Biden]{.mark} administration [has
declined to go to war on Manila's behalf.]{.mark} But the possibility
remains so long as the U.S. foolishly guarantees Philippine
security.]{.underline} [Indeed, some things never change. One is [the
**limited value** of the **Philippines as an
ally**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Its people are friendly and welcoming ---
and quite pro‐​American. But [[it is a **semi‐​failed state** with a
military to match]{.mark}. Manila is a sad example of how the US has
picked up the old German habit of allying with the least stable nations
possessing the weakest militaries --- as Berlin did with Austro‐​Hungary
in World War I and Italy in World War II.]{.underline} In the case of
Washington the primes useless partner is the Philippines. The
relationship wouldn't matter so much if Manila didn't expect America to
protect not only its home islands, but also every useless piece of rock
claimed by the Philippines against China, such as Scarborough Shoal. If
Beijing and Washington end up at war --- a horrific possibility --- the
cause should be more serious than the Philippines[. Manila is as an
American ally because of blatant US imperialism]{.underline}. The early
Americans revolted against empire and eschewed overseas adventurism as
they overspread the North American continent. However, the Sirens of
Asia attracted Washington. After the US went to war with Spain, formally
to liberate Cuba promoted by a simultaneously scurrilous and scandalous
"Yellow Press" propaganda campaign, American forces seized the
Philippines as well. Famed imperialists declared that the oceans made
the archipelago contiguous, and thus an appropriate target of
annexation. Washington should drop its defense guarantee and begin
negotiations to turn the faux mutual defense treaty into a real treaty
of mutual cooperation. Alas, the Filipinos had other ideas, having
already launched a domestic independence movement. What followed was
three years of ruthless irregular warfare, featuring "concentration
zones," which US soldiers compared to Washington's veritable
extermination campaigns against native Americans. War crimes mixed with
starvation to kill 200,000 or more Filipino civilians. Resentment long
lingered, especially in some Muslim‐​majority islands, such as Mindanao,
where armed opposition to the central government continues. Even Duterte
raised the issue, demanding the return of the famed Balangiga Bells,
taken as war booty and which, he reasonably contended, "are reminders of
the gallantry and heroism of our forebears ... who resisted the American
colonization and sacrificed their lives in the process." Washington
finally granted the archipelago's independence in 1946, after the
Philippines' liberation from Japan. The US approved the 1951 Mutual
Defense Treaty, which, like similar agreements with South Korea, Japan,
and Europe (NATO), effectively ran only one way, committing the US to
defend the Philippines. Four decades later a deteriorating bilateral
relationship and volcanic eruption pushed America out of both Clark
Airfield and Subic Bay. The departure was long overdue. [[The
archipelago]{.mark} obviously [**matters not at all** to defending
America]{.mark} itself.]{.underline} Washington would prefer that Manila
rather than Beijing control resources and waterways in the region, but
[[**the practical impact** on the US **is
marginal**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Base access always is useful. However,
no Philippine president, even one calmer and friendlier than Rodrigo
Duterte, would likely make his or her nation available for American
military operations against the PRC except to defend against an unlikely
attack on the archipelago. Aiding America against Beijing would make the
Philippines a permanent enemy of China, which will always be close by.

[In 1964, when China first tested nuclear weapons, [Mao]{.mark} Zedong
[used to claim that the country was populous enough to survive
a]{.mark}n all-out [nuclear attack]{.mark}. [His successors are under no
such illusion]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [And Mao's statement was made in
the context of announcing a "no first strike" policy, to which China has
adhered ever since]{.underline}.]{.mark} [[There is no evidence that
China has any intention of using nuclear weapons except as a deterrent
to a nuclear attack by another power]{.mark}]{.underline} The mutual
sabre-rattling associated with South China Sea mythology is beneficial
to a variety of actors in the United States, China and elsewhere. The
military-industrial complex, against which President Eisenhower warned
60 years ago, is powerful in every country, and always seeks to promote
preparation for large-scale war as well as the routine use of military
power for political and commercial ends. [Nationalist politicians
promote territorial claims of all kinds, and exaggerate their
importance.]{.underline} And both Chinese and Taiwanese governments have
good reasons to keep the idea of an invasion of Taiwan alive.
