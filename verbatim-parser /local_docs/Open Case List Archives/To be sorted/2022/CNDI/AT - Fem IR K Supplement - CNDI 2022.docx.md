[For labor market and social protection policies to fulfill their role,
they need to adapt and respond to the nature of current labor
markets.]{.underline} Economic growth does not automatically translate
into new and better jobs. Since the 1980s, austerity macroeconomic
policies have led to increasing unemployment in formal labor markets
while increasing informal employment (UN Women 2017). [While women's
labor force participation has been growing, limited decent job
opportunities constrains women's employment options in formal labor
markets.]{.underline} In Latin America, the best outcomes in terms of
formalization in the early 21st century have occurred in contexts of
accelerated economic growth and institutional interventions and
comprehensive policies, such as changes in legislation, labor
enforcement of labor regulations and employment policies
(Salazar-Xirinachs and Chacaltana 2018). Some of the formalization
strategies specifically aimed at work with considerable informality
rates. For instance, in several Latin American countries special
taxation schemes were designed for micro and small enterprises and
own-account workers and pieces of legislation were passed to regulate
minimum wage and working hours of domestic and rural workers. [However,
thus far, informality rates have not changed dramatically, suggesting
that there is a strong structural component in the regional labor market
segmentation]{.underline} (UN Women 2017).Informal work in the Global
South 203 [The debate on benefits of formalization includes the
perspective of organized women informal workers of the Global South.
Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO) argues
that the right to the city (i.e., a claim to recognize the city as a
co-created space) as well as economic rights should prevail when
discussing, for instance, street vendor's activities]{.underline}. A
legalist approach that forces them to formalize may have negative effect
on women's well-being as this may push them out of employment.
[Alternatively, there are good examples of regularization via complex
public, private and community partnership models such as in
Bhubaneshwar]{.underline}. This city is among the first ones in India to
acknowledge street vendors as an integral part of the city by
establishing aesthetically pleasing fixed kiosks in legally sanctioned
vending zones (Kumar 2012). [Some public policies tend to be gender
blind and lack awareness regarding the importance of promoting women's
autonomy and economic empowerment to move toward a more egalitarian
society. Accordingly, policy changes regarding work formalization in
Latin America do not have clear objectives regarding the gendered
constraints women face in informal employment]{.underline} (except for
those addressing domestic service work). However, in 2016--17, a growing
number of economies in the Global South have implemented employment
policies and measures based on both gender equality principles and
formalization of the informal economy. [Even when policy is
gender-blind, it can benefit women]{.underline}. Otobe (2017) describes
two such experiences: the National Human Resources and Employment Policy
for Sri Lanka and the National Employment Policy of Mozambique[. While
articulation of policy measures on formalization of informal employment
is not necessarily gender inclusive or responsive in either case, policy
measures stated under gender issues could contribute to formalization by
promoting formal employment for both women and men equally.]{.underline}
Feminist insights on the impact of informal employment Remunerated work
opportunities vary from low-waged precarious forms of informal
employment to formal jobs, which normally offer higher wages, more
stability and a certain level of social protection and security.
Informal work may lead to economic and social empowerment as it
contributes to poverty alleviation at the household level (USAID 2005)
and it may ease the "double burden" of paid and unpaid work, through
more flexible work schedules. However, freer access to informal labor
markets will not eliminate the disadvantages arising from male-biased
institutions (Meagher 2010). For example, gender pay gaps are often
wider in informal employment compared to formal employment. For
instance, in sub-Saharan Africa, the gender pay gap is 28 percent in
informal employment compared to 6 percent for formal workers. In the
informal economy, men predominate among employers and employees while
women are over-represented among the least-secure and lowest-paying
occupations (e.g., homeworkers and contributing family workers) (UN
Women 2017). [On the other hand, informal work could allow women to have
their own incomes and access to the public sphere, thus reducing their
dependence on male income-earners (Kabeer 2008, 2012).]{.underline} In
their study of the Ecuador, Vega et al. (2016) conclude that the
economic livelihood strategies are not necessarily translated into
empowerment processes. [Nevertheless, they argue that particularly young
women see informal activities as temporary, in which case these
strategies may be a means to enhance social mobility and to improve
their prospects]{.underline}. Moreover, there are examples of informal,
poor women workers organizing and being empowered, such as through SEWA
(Self Employed Women's Association) and WIEGO. Agenda for decent work
Most studies of informal employment have not incorporated a critical
perspective that examines gendered power relations (Chant and Pedwell
2008). They also lack an intersectional approach that takes into account
the differences and relations among women. An in-depth study of these
aspects requires quantitative and qualitative research, which will shed
light on the processes and subjective elements and their impact on
women's autonomy and economic empowerment. Gender-blind analyses of the
mechanisms and features of informality in labor markets lead to partial
explanations and therefore partial solutions to informality. Thus,
addressing economic and social causes of informal employment is as
important as identifying and examining the implications of gender
discrimination and employment segregation and the gender division of
paid and unpaid work that contribute to informality. Moreover, it is
necessary to incorporate an intersectional perspective, which addresses
not only gender but a range of axes of social differentiation such as
class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, age, nation, religion and ability
(Chant and Pedwell 2008). [Considering that informal employment is
principally a problem of weak labor demand, macroeconomic policies
should target increasing labor demand. Particularly, to tackle gender
inequality in the labor market, there is a need to invest in public care
services and create decent job opportunities in the areas of health,
education, child and elderly care services (ILO 2018d).]{.underline} The
redistribution of unpaid household work and care work not only within
households (between women and men) but also among public and private
sector actors should be included as part of public policies based on
principles of equity and social co-responsibility. [Public policies that
facilitate equitable sharing of care work allow women to enter the labor
force and to avoid precarious forms of work]{.underline}. These policies
include parental leave policies and public provision of child and
elderly care services. [To combat occupational segregation, public
interventions are important to address its root causes, including
differences in educational attainment, training and experience as well
as stereotypes about the roles of women and men in society.]{.underline}
To provide women with income opportunities beyond informal employment it
is also necessary to strengthen women's income security, for example, by
providing access to unemployment protection and public work programs (UN
Women 2017). [Addressing informality and decent work deficits require
changes in the design and application of social protection
programs]{.underline}. As the 101st Session of the International Labor
Conference made clear in Recommendation No. 202, the social protection
floor is a means of extending social security coverage where the
contributory and noncontributory benefits operate in conjunction (ILO
2012). This combination may have positive impacts on job quality and may
promote formalization. Given higher levels of participation of women in
informal, precarious forms of work and the interruption of their work
career because of their reproductive role and disproportionate care work
burden, a strong non-contributory pillar of social protection scheme
could be the key to promoting gender equality in social protection.

### Liberalism Good

#### Liberalism is key to checking oppression---policy reforms key to maintaining the liberal world order

International Cooperation. \"Liberalism Isn't Dead---but It's Very
Sick\", Foreign Policy, 5/10/2022,

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has played out like a terribly grim, but
so far at least, profoundly ennobling laboratory experiment in the
relative virtues of autocracy and liberal democracy.]{.underline} Yet
evidence that a (more or less) liberal democracy can defeat or withstand
an autocracy even in war---the one sphere that so obviously favors the
latter---hasn't, and probably won't, meaningfully diminish the forces
that have undermined liberalism in the West and around the world.
Indeed, the sharp division between Western democracies that regard the
invasion as an intolerable violation of moral principle and non-Western
and barely liberal ones like India and South Africa that have treated it
as geopolitics as usual only reinforces the idea that liberal democracy
occupies a diminishing space in the world. It is possible that liberal
democracy was a historically contingent experiment that depended on
underlying conditions that no longer obtain. In his 2018 book, The
People vs. Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger and How to Save It,
Harvard scholar Yascha Mounk described those limiting conditions as
broadly shared prosperity, relative demographic homogeneity, and sources
of information that encompass the whole population. That was the last
century, not this one. [Yet if you believe that all alternatives to
liberal democracy are much worse---indeed, unbearable---then you must
proceed as if the illness it suffers from is curable.]{.underline} That
is the premise of Mounk's new work, the more optimistically titled The
Great Experiment: Why Diverse Democracies Fall Apart and How They Can
Endure, as well as Liberalism and Its Discontents by Francis Fukuyama,
also a long-standing combatant in the liberalism wars. [Liberalism, as
Fukuyama describes it, functions as a political technology for the
management of otherwise irreconcilable differences]{.underline}.
Liberals from the time of Thomas Hobbes in the 17th century have erected
a series of procedural rules and normative principles---above all, the
rule of law and the rights of individuals to pursue their own
preferences---to limit the reach of absolutist doctrines. Liberal rules
and norms allow people of different views not only to get along but to
subscribe to the implicit "contract" on which democratic government
rests. Liberalism is endangered when the "factions," to use James
Madison's term, that arise naturally in society cease to respect the
rules and norms. But liberalism has a problem when those factions
consist not of like-minded individuals but of tribes: ethnic or
religious groups bound together less by changeable beliefs than by
immutable characteristics. A "diverse democracy," in Mounk's sense, is a
heterogeneous one. In such states, "where virtually everyone votes along
religious or ethnic lines," Mounk observes, "a large portion of the
population forms a permanent minority," locked out of power, while
majorities use their power to dominate or marginalize minorities, as
white people did to Black people in the American antebellum and Jim Crow
South and as Hindus now do to Muslims in India. Liberalism addresses
people as equal, free-standing citizens; but Mounk has concluded that
the wish to stand apart from kin, culture, and state is less primordial
than we think[. Both experience and social science research show us that
people are by nature "groupish." The chief threat to liberalism over the
last decade has been majoritarian nationalism provoked by real or
alleged threats to collective identity]{.underline}---whiteness in the
United States and Europe, Hinduism in India, Judaism in Israel, and
Islam in Turkey. Against this rage, liberal universalism, the idea that
we all have equal rights based in our common humanity, has steadily
retreated. No one has developed an entirely convincing answer to the
problem of diverse democracy. The "consociational" model, where power is
allocated among groups that enjoy formal status, has worked out well in
the Netherlands, divided between Catholics and Protestants, but very
badly in Lebanon, where power-sharing among different religious factions
has currently produced a vacuum of governance very close to anarchy.
Slightly over 40 percent of the French public just voted for a
presidential candidate who promised to restore the primacy of natives
over newcomers and, not coincidentally, white people over people of
color. The first wave of rise-of-illiberalism books---including Mounk's
and Fukuyama's earlier books as well as Steven Levitsky and Daniel
Ziblatt's How Democracies Die and my own What Was Liberalism?: The Past,
Present, and Promise of a Noble Idea---focused almost entirely on the
right-wing nationalism of former U.S. President Donald Trump, French
politician Marine Le Pen, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and
others. That's old news by now. One of the features of the new
generation of liberalism-in-peril books is worry over the rise of an
identitarian left that is equally contemptuous of liberal restraints.
Fukuyama writes of a species of identity politics that "sees the lived
experiences of different groups as fundamentally incommensurate." White
people cannot understand what it means to be Black; racism is not an
individual attitude but is rather imprinted in the structures of power,
and thus in collective consciousness. Mounk describes the "strategic
essentialism" of those who insist that we treat race or gender as
ineradicable essences. This is the new groupishness of the left. Anyone
who has spent time in the advanced institutions of American
culture---universities, art museums, foundations, newspapers---will
recognize this mentality. It is, however, striking that while right-wing
nationalism has circled the globe, the so-called woke left is an almost
entirely U.S. phenomenon. It explains nothing about illiberalism in
India or Poland and very little about France or Germany. Why is it that
the most advanced progressive thinking in the United States, but not
elsewhere, is obsessed with the policing of group boundaries and the
honoring of group rights? Perhaps because of the unique role that racial
anger and racial shame play in the United States. The effect, in any
case, is to set up a kind of reciprocal tribalism, where the left and
right goad each other to greater extremes. Both agree on the need to
weed out evil books from libraries but disagree violently over the books
in question; meanwhile, what historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called the
"vital center" recedes to an ever more distant horizon. [What is to be
done? Fukuyama's answer is to defend the citadel]{.underline}. In this
slim volume (a euphemism for a long magazine article by a famous author
that publishers are eager to issue in book form), Fukuyama, in the
manner of philosopher Isaiah Berlin, traces the evolutionary path of the
new illiberal ideologies, locating their origin in the postmodern
critique of rationality of philosophers Jacques Derrida and Michel
Foucault, a doctrine of the radical left later picked up by the right.
And then, like a stout crusader of liberalism, he smites them one and
all. [Fukuyama first refutes what might be called the neoliberal or free
market heresy of liberalism, noting that while humans are indeed
self-seeking, "they are also intensely social creatures who cannot be
individually happy without the support and recognition provided by their
peers." But neoliberalism is a heresy, or a perversion, for liberal
societies created the redistributionist state that promoted equality in
the 20th century. Fukuyama goes on to note that liberalism is not so
obsessed with the individual as to inevitably atomize society, as many
Catholic conservatives claim:]{.underline} "Private associational life
has grown enormously" in the liberal societies of the West. Nor must
liberal states plead guilty to colonialism. How, after all, should we
explain the rise of liberal East Asian states innocent of that charge?
Fukuyama reminds liberals of what they stand for and why they are right
to stand for it. Of course, that's not a solution. Mounk writes that big
books about ideas tend to be far better at explaining the problem than
at offering solutions. Another way of putting it, though, is that
illiberalism is the kind of problem to which solutions inevitably feel
inadequate because the problem is not a failure of policy but of
collective belief. [How do you create conditions that will favor a
restoration of a vanished consensus? For Mounk, that comes down to the
question of mechanisms to contain and channel the tribalism that one
cannot wish away]{.underline}. Ranked choice voting, for example, will
help gain representation for minorities, he argues. [Much of Mounk's
agenda resembles the current Democratic Party platform: broad-based
economic growth, progressive taxation, and opportunities for social
mobility---all designed to create a sense of collective rather than
tribal good]{.underline}. In that vein, he argues---against the
progressive left---for universal rather than race-conscious policies and
for limits on immigration, a flash point for the nativist right. These
are good solutions, but I do not see how they will cure the patient.
(For the record, I was not entirely convinced by the solutions I offered
in What Was Liberalism?) Mounk doesn't entirely disagree: [He writes
that liberalism ultimately must be defended at the level of private and
social behavior]{.underline}. He advises all of us to think for
ourselves and be prepared to criticize our own side and restrain the
impulse to vilify the other. I am guessing that most readers of his book
will not need that advice, whereas the tribalists of left and right
would sneer at it. I read The Great Experiment while thinking about
India, the biggest and most diverse of the world's democracies. India is
also among the sickest patients in the liberal democracy ward. Born
under the star of secularism and tolerance, India under Modi has
increasingly become a theistic and intolerant society that advances the
cause of Hinduism at the expense of its more than 200 million Muslims. I
asked myself whether Mounk had anything to offer the many Indians who
believe in the nation's secular values and deeply fear their demise. The
answer is: not much. Some diseases prove fatal; others can only be cured
very slowly, as the patient's own defenses finally rally. I am in favor
of everything Mounk suggests; I am even more in favor of Fukuyama's
rousing call to truth. [Only liberalism, as both authors argue, can
allow us to live safely and prosperously in a diverse world. But I
recognize that the restraints imposed by liberal rules and norms ask a
great deal of citizens, far more than nativism, nationalism, or
majoritarian tyranny do. We need to keep fighting for what is right even
as we recognize that the road will be long.]{.underline}

#### Modern liberalism good---defensive liberalism is the most effective tool for emancipation in modernity and reforms solve its flaws

Affairs at Princeton University. "Mastering Modernity." A World Safe for
Democracy: Liberal Internationalism and the Crises of Global Order. Pp

[On what grounds can we defend liberal internationalism?]{.underline}
This question can be answered by looking at six major debates that
liberal internationalists have had among themselves over their project's
scope and character. In these debates, they have grappled with the
trade-offs between efficiency and social stability, sovereignty and
interventionism, and global openness and political community. They have
debated the nature of "the global"---the forces and logic shaping the
modern world and their implications for the security and well-being of
liberal democracy. As they did in past crises, liberal internationalists
must again debate the character, limits, and possibilities of their
project. Efficiency versus Social Stability A core strand of liberal
internationalism has been a commitment to open trade. Countries linked
by trade and open markets gain both economically and politically.
[Ideally, trade generates efficiency and welfare gains for countries
that participate, thus facilitating their growth and advancement. These
mutual gains and interdependence have political effects, including
heightened incentives to settle disputes peacefully.]{.underline} From
the British repeal of the Corn Laws to the post-1945 building of a
multilateral trading system, liberal democracies have consistently
looked for ways to realize the gains of trade. [Winners win more than
losers lose, so if the winnings are distributed in ways that compensate
the losers, everyone comes out ahead]{.underline}. But open trade is a
disruptive threat to workers and communities, and the social bargains
that soften the impact of economic dislocation are imperfect. In giving
national governments space and policy tools to pursue economic
stabilization and development, the "embedded liberalism" behind the
reconstruction of the postwar Western world tried to reconcile open
trade and free-market capitalism with social protections and economic
security. [As we saw in chapter 8, this compromise has broken down. The
embrace of neoliberal policies and the deregulation and global
integration of capital markets that accompanied the post--Cold War
spread of economic and political liberalism have been driving
forces.]{.underline} The Western governments' capacity and willingness
to maintain their social democratic commitments has waned. Even under
the best of conditions, the model of international trade at the heart of
economic liberalism oversimplifies reality. "It neglects all the
noneconomic considerations that so often turn governments away from its
prescriptions, such as the social and cultural side-effects of trade, or
the frequent neglect of public goods, collective equipments, and
education," writes Stanley Hoffmann. "Above all, it ignores factors of
inequality: the benefits from free trade spread slowly, if at all, and
unevenly through the formidable barriers of privilege, class, and status
within societies (in which small groups often monopolize the rewards)
and the obstacles of unequal endowments and levels of development in the
world."1 Not all the rise in inequality or the breakdown in economic and
social protections is traceable to the liberalization of trade and
capital flows. Technological changes in the workplace and shifts from
manufacturing to services also play a role.2 But efficiency gains from
deeper economic integration seem to be slowing relative to the rise of
economic insecurity and inequality. Dani Rodrik argues that the advanced
industrial countries have already passed the point beyond which expanded
trade does more to redistribute wealth within their societies than to
increase efficiency and growth. Although economic globalization is
intensifying the gaps between the winners and losers, it is not
generating sufficient economic gains to compensate the losers.3 In
making the case for economic openness, liberal internationalists will
need to reestablish the foundations of embedded liberalism---that is,
managed openness that reconnects trade and markets with social security
and shared gains. The industrial world cannot return to the early
decades of the Bretton Woods system, but it can look for new ways to
balance openness and social protections. [The aim of reforming
international rules and institutions should be to enable national
governments to make good on their social democratic
commitments]{.underline}. "Democracies have a right to protect their
social arrangements," Rodrik argues, "and when this right clashes with
the requirements of the global economy, it is the latter that should
give way."4 [Economic openness can last in liberal democracies only if
it is tied to a social ethic of fairness and shared benefits. Without
inaugurating a new era of protectionism, liberal democracies have to
reestablish the multilateral system of rules and institutions that
allows states to manage openness, guided by the liberal norms of
multilateralism, reciprocity, and nondiscrimination]{.underline}. They
need to rebuild the social contract at home and renew the international
rules and norms that balance openness with social stability. Sovereignty
versus Interventionism [The norms of sovereign equality and national
self-determination are integral to the modern liberal international
vision]{.underline}. As we have seen, by the second half of the
twentieth century, the liberal international project was firmly built on
a Westphalian foundation. [To be sure, the United States and other
liberal states have repeatedly practiced all the dark arts of power
politics.]{.underline} Throughout the Cold War and post--Cold War
decades, they have transgressed sovereignty norms through military
intervention, covert action, and coercive regime change. [But the norms
and principles of state sovereignty remain firmly embedded in the
institutions and legitimating rationale of the post--World War II
liberal international order.]{.underline} American military
interventionism during the Cold War played out as part of the
geopolitical and ideological struggle with the Soviet Union. The Korean
and Vietnam Wars were the most tragic and costly of the dozens of armed
interventions carried out by the United States across the Cold War
periphery. [Since the Soviet Union fell, the reasons for interventions
have expanded to include humanitarian disasters, human rights
violations, and nonstate terrorist threats]{.underline}. In areas of
humanitarianism, economic policy, and democracy promotion, the Western
liberal states look increasingly as if they are trying to impose their
own values and interests on weaker states.5 [In this regard, it is
useful to distinguish between two versions of liberal internationalism:
defensive and offensive.6]{.underline} Defensive liberalism is the older
liberal orientation anchored in the norms of self-determination and the
right of countries to maintain their own institutions and doctrines.
[Offensive liberalism is the more recent universalizing agenda that
involves the reordering of other societies.7 Rising states such as
China, India, and Brazil tend to embrace defensive liberalism and resist
the intrusiveness of the newer liberalism.]{.underline} In accommodating
these rising powers, liberal internationalism will need to rethink their
offensive liberal impulses[. Gaining agreement on the broader principles
of order---sovereignty and multilateral rules and institutions that
allow states to manage their interdependence---should take precedence
over efforts to force convergence on the details of development or
governance]{.underline}. [In the areas of human rights and transnational
terrorism, the dilemmas are less about the imposition of liberal values
on unwilling states than about the circumstances under which the
international community needs to act.8]{.underline} When a state commits
mass domestic violence such as genocide or ethnic cleansing, the outside
world cannot simply look away. If a state is collapsed or unable to
prevent transnational terrorist groups from operating on its territory,
these circumstances might also require the international community's
intervention[. The response proposed for these occasions is the evolving
norm of "responsibility to protect" (R2P), which was adopted by the
United Nations in 2005 and remains controversial.9 R2P is not a license
for great powers to unilaterally intervene in weaker
states]{.underline}. It is meant to stimulate international agreement on
the circumstances under which agents of the international
community---authorized by the United Nations---are morally obliged to
prevent or stop atrocities. The burden of the norm is actually
Westphalian in implication. Its goal is to strengthen the presumption
that national governments must make good on their obligations as
sovereign states and that the international order should help them do
so. [Only in the absence of this Westphalian state capacity---and under
extreme conditions defined by the international community---do outside
powers intervene]{.underline}. The goal for liberal internationalists
should be to seek as wide an agreement as possible on the legal bases
for intervention.10 Clubs and Open Systems The postwar liberal
international order was built around exclusive groupings of states, such
as NATO and the European Union, as well as wider multilateral
organizations with more open membership, such as the United Nations.
When the Cold War broke the world into bipolar blocs, the United States
and its partners put their efforts into building the Western economic
and security order. This Western political grouping resembled a club. It
was a clearly defined, exclusive group of like-minded states with a
shared identity based on their regime characteristics, geography, and
historical experience. There was little doubt about who was inside and
who was outside the order.11 As I argued in chapter 6, the club
character of the postwar liberal order was important for its
functioning. To be inside was to have rights and responsibilities. The
club offered protection and provided governments with institutions and
capacities to facilitate cooperation and problem solving. The
compromises of embedded liberalism were organized within its confines.
That there were barriers to entry only reinforced commitment and
cooperation. In chapter 8, I argued that the erosion of this club-like
nature is a defining feature of the current crisis. [Open systems of
multilateral cooperation, which reflect the Westphalian norms of
sovereign equality and nondiscrimination that are embedded in the wider
global order, are also integral to the liberal international
vision]{.underline}. Membership in these organizations is predicated not
on regime character, but only on recognition of a state's sovereign
status and its commitment and ability to carry out the responsibilities
of membership. [If the legitimacy of the club of liberal democracies
lies in their shared social purposes, the legitimacy of open systems of
order derives from the universalism inherent in Westphalian principles
of sovereignty]{.underline}. An open system's strength is its
inclusiveness. [For many realms of international relations---including
arms control, pandemic disease prevention, environmental regulation, and
management of the global commons---regime type is not relevant to
cooperation]{.underline}. Addressing these problems requires as wide a
participation of states as possible. The weakness of open systems is in
enforcement. If the rules say that any state can be in or out as it
chooses, the benefits of membership cannot be predicated on embracing a
suite of values and responsibilities. Liberal internationalists,
including Woodrow Wilson, have spoken up for both types of order.
Initially, in offering American support for a postwar organization,
Wilson argued in favor of open and universal membership. In his speech
to the League to Enforce the Peace in May 1916, Wilson said the United
States "shall be as much concerned as the nations at war to see peace
assume an aspect of permanence." This was why it would be in the
nation's interest to participate in a "universal association of the
nations . . . to prevent any war begun either contrary to treaty
covenants or without warning and full submission of the causes to the
opinion of the world---a virtual guarantee of territorial integrity and
political independence." Eager not to be seen as committing the United
States to upholding an unjust status quo, Wilson advanced general
principles that would guide the settlement, including famously asserting
that "every people" had "a right to choose the sovereignty under which
they shall live," and small states were entitled to "the same respect
for their sovereignty and for their integrity that great and powerful
nations expect and insist upon."12 During the years of American
neutrality, Wilson did not once mention that the peace settlement would
be linked to the way states were internally governed or the character of
their regimes.13 In January 1917, Wilson's "peace without victory"
speech explicitly called for a settlement between existing states and
regimes. It was only after Wilson brought the United States into the war
that he shifted the focus to freedom and democracy as prerequisites for
peace. In his War Address in April 1917, Wilson now asserted that "a
steadfast concert of peace can never be maintained except by a
partnership of democratic governments. No autocratic state government
could be trusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants."14
Wilson was now envisaging a more exclusive grouping of democracies that
would be bound together ideologically and oriented toward building a
democratic peace. After the war was over, Wilson essentially reverted
back to the open and universal version of his program. For Wilson, in
the end, the establishment of a League of Nations was more important
than the specific logic of its membership. The question today for
liberal internationalism is: How much of the clublike character of
liberal order should and can be rebuilt? The goal is not to undermine or
ignore the Westphalian principles that set the terms of wider global
cooperation. [But what is the future of the deeper, more exclusive
cooperation among liberal democracies? In security relations, human
rights, and the political economy of industrial society, liberal
democracies have specific interests and values that illiberal states do
not. Exclusive groupings within the wider international order are still
an important means for advancing these values]{.underline}. So too is it
important to strengthen the mechanisms of conditionality and the
enforcement of norms and principles within the club. The European Union
is struggling to respond to member states that transgress its common
standards. NATO has also found itself struggling to deal with alliance
members that lose their democratic character.15 The irony of the rise of
China and Russia as overt challengers to Western liberal democracy is
that it may strengthen the identity and functioning of the liberal
democratic world as a political grouping, even as it gives illiberal
states an alternative club to join. Relations with the Illiberal World
Dealing with illiberal great powers is one of the oldest problems facing
the liberal international order. Do you invite them in, anticipating
that they will become socialized and move toward liberal democracy? Do
you exclude them? Do you actively seek to confront their revisionist
agendas, or seek peaceful coexistence? At different times over the past
two centuries, liberal states have pursued all these strategies. [The
underlying reality is that the liberal international order---open,
rules-based, and organized around a core of liberal democracies---is a
threat to illiberal states]{.underline}. From their perspective, the
United States and the liberal capitalist order are revisionist. The
American grand strategy at the end of the Cold War was to invite the
illiberal states into the liberal order. [Once China and Russia gained
the benefits of trade and exchange, went the reasoning, they would
understand that it was in their interest to become "responsible
stakeholders."]{.underline} Implicit in this logic was the expectation
that these states would engage in self-initiated regime change. They
would slowly shed their autocratic and authoritarian institutions and
move closer to the Western liberal democratic model. [This has not
happened, and liberal internationalists must now reassess their
assumptions and consider new approaches. One option is to seek
accommodation with these illiberal states by making the liberal
international order less revisionist. This might mean curtailing efforts
to promote "offensive" liberalism"---that is, efforts to push and pull
these states toward the liberal democratic model]{.underline}. In
effect, this strategy calls for making the liberal international order
friendly to China and Russia by stepping back from the vision of a
one-world liberal order. [The emphasis instead would be on coexistence,
building on the "defensive" liberal principles of self-determination,
tolerance, and ideological pluralism]{.underline}. Liberal
internationalism would be made more conservative.16 Another option is to
confront illiberal states more aggressively. The assumption here is that
China and Russia are the vanguard of a broader longterm challenge to the
liberal international order. If it cannot contain the ambitions of these
countries, the liberal order itself is threatened. This view hinges on a
key claim about China: that it hopes to perfect an authoritarian model
of industrial society that can compete with---and even surpass---the
long-term growth capacity of liberal democracy. The jury is still out.17
But if China does succeed in offering the world an illiberal pathway to
modernity, the stakes for the liberal democratic world rise and the
rivalry can easily become a Cold War--style struggle between deeply
antagonistic ideological and political projects. [Finally, liberal
internationalists might pursue a mixed strategy of looking for
opportunities to cooperate with China and Russia on the playing field of
Westphalian internationalism, focusing on shared functional problems
such as arms control, environment, and the global commons, while
actively seeking to consolidate and strengthen cooperation across the
liberal democratic world. Here the assumption is that the liberal
democracies---particularly if they are organized worldwide---have
long-term advantages that will bend the grand struggle in their
favor]{.underline}. The key is to renew and defend liberal democracy
within like-minded states and to strengthen the institutions,
functionality, and legitimacy of the liberal international order.18
Hegemony and Restraint on Power [Over the past century, the liberal
international project has become deeply entangled with the exercise of
American power]{.underline}. Woodrow Wilson carried liberal
internationalist ideas to the Paris Peace Conference. After World War
II, the United States built a liberal hegemonic order organized around
open, rules-based relations and a core of Western liberal democracies.
As I argued in chapter 6, this liberal hegemonic order both amplified
and legitimated American power as well as shaped and restrained it. The
United States tied itself to the other leading liberal states and
exercised power through an array of economic, political, and security
institutions. How restrained it was during the postwar era is a subject
of much debate. Institutional restraints were certainly not an iron
cage, and the United States reserved the right to act unilaterally when
it chose. Power politics was hardly eliminated from the democratic
world. [Nonetheless, this liberal hegemonic order did manifest important
features of consent. The United States and the other Western liberal
democracies used institutions to establish restraint and commitment, and
in doing so, they created an order that was somewhat independent of
balance-of-power and imperial logics. The presence of liberal
institutions allowed these states to dampen the two forces that
typically shape international order---anarchy and empire. These forces
never totally disappeared, of course, but they retreated enough to
define the Western order as a hierarchical order with liberal
characteristics.19]{.underline} Liberal internationalism has both
benefited and suffered under American hegemony. Like Great Britain in
the nineteenth century, the United States in the twentieth century
incorporated liberal internationalist ideas and projects into its
hegemonic order building while pursuing other great-power strategies.
Great Britain held on to its empire, and the United States engaged in
crude imperial ventures and cultivated close relations with illiberal
states. [But particularly after 1945, it is difficult to see how liberal
internationalism--- defined as open and rules-based order with
progressive social purposes--- would have fared any better if it were
not closely tied to America's efforts to organize and dominate the
postwar international order]{.underline}. As I argued in chapter 6,
American postwar leaders recognized the value of binding the nation to
other liberal democracies and operating within the postwar system of
multilateral institutions. This strategy made American power more
legitimate and enduring. The liberal great power's pursuit of
enlightened self-interest was integral to the rise and spread of liberal
ideas and projects. Yet the United States also demonstrated, repeatedly,
that it can be an unfaithful steward of liberal internationalism. Under
the Trump administration, it is actively seeking to undermine the
liberal features of the existing global order. The challenge for liberal
internationalists is to try to recover the connections between hegemony
and liberal order. The reasons powerful liberal states might want to
build and operate within a system of open, rules-based relations are
clear enough. As I argued in chapter 8, the hollowing out of the
security-community character of the existing liberal order is one reason
it is now in crisis: today it is easier for leaders to offer alternative
narratives of the American national interest. The Trump administration's
claims that the liberal order generates more costs than benefits for the
United States also register with some voters. [Yet the costs that the
United States incurs from seeking to operate outside the rules and norms
of liberal international order are also real---and over the long term,
they are much greater. They include the loss of influence, credibility,
and the cooperation of friends and allies.]{.underline} America's
democratic allies clearly want the United States to remain within this
order. During the high tide of American unipolarity, it was possible for
US officials to see less value in liberal rules and institutions. [But
in an era of declining American power, the value of cooperation with
other liberal democracies should grow]{.underline}. Roles,
responsibilities, expectations, bargains---these aspects of the postwar
liberal order draw our attention precisely because the Trump
administration ignores and undermines them. [Yet lurking in this new
danger is an opportunity to renegotiate the hegemonic character of
liberal internationalism or, short of this, build a post-hegemonic
consortium of like-minded states that could collectively underwrite a
reformed liberal order.]{.underline}

#### Liberalism is key to checking imperialism---liberal ideology elevates universal rights

[If liberal internationalism had an urge for empire, it also had an urge
to oppose it. In the late nineteenth century, liberal thinkers in the
United States and Europe added their voices to movements against empire
and colonialism]{.underline}. After the world wars, many liberal
internationalists, particularly in the United States, championed the
League of Nations and the United Nations as institutions that enshrined
principles of self-determination and sovereign equality---and thus
offered a path away from empire. As the twentieth century unfolded,
liberal internationalists grew increasingly committed to postimperial
forms of order. These changes in orientation played out in the struggles
between the United States and Britain during and after World War II over
imperial preferences and global spheres of influence. The shift away
from empire emerged as part of the general reimagining of liberal
internationalism in the 1940s and during the Cold War, when the United
States put its weight behind a world organized around sovereign states
as it pursued its expanding geopolitical interests and built postwar
order. [In important respects, however, it was not the West that turned
liberal internationalism against empire and imperialism but the
non-West, which seized upon ideas and principles---universal in
character but often instrumental in origin and purpose---and applied
them to struggles over sovereignty, rights, and rules.]{.underline}
Wilson-era liberal internationalism had offered global ideas, but it
retained an old-style Western parochialism. The vision of liberal order
put forward by Wilson and his peers was more "civilizational" than
"universal." The League of Nations would be open to the wider world, but
it was organized around the Western liberal democracies. States that
were considered insufficiently mature to join the community of sovereign
states would have to wait until they were ready. As Edward Keene argues,
the League of Nations entailed the "internationalization" of
civilization---so there were limits on the universal or global scope of
membership and standing. "Although ideological concerns were beginning
to become more important in defining the boundaries of the civilized
world, racial discrimination was still a major element in deciding which
peoples were entitled to membership in the new organization and thus to
have their sovereign status recognized."62 [With the rebuilding of order
after World War II and the establishment of the United Nations, this
civilizational view---the distinction between the "family of civilized
nations" and the rest of the world---gave way to a more universalistic
and inclusive conception]{.underline}. Keene argues, "Simply put: the
United Nations was envisioned as, or quite rapidly became, an
organization of all the world's peoples, with universal participation in
the projects of preserving peace and developing global civilization,
whereas the League had, above all, been an organization of civilized
nations, working collectively for all the world's peoples." Postwar
notions of states, peoples, sovereignty, and civilization were becoming
less based on nineteenth-century notions of the social hierarchies of
peoples. As Keene notes, "the development of the UN system reflected a
much more inclusive attitude toward non-European peoples, in keeping
with the recognition that they were no less civilized than their
European counterparts."63 [What changed between 1919 and 1945 was the
conception of how peoples and societies from different regions and
civilizations related to each other as moral and legal entities, a move
driven in part by a fuller acknowledgment of the universal reach of the
notion of sovereign equality.64 But it was also driven by the growing
salience of the "rights of peoples"---the spread of the claim that all
human beings, by virtue of being human, have fundamental and inalienable
rights.]{.underline} Behind this shift were changing views of modernity
and civilization. Civilization itself was weakening as an intellectual
construct, and modernity was not seen simply as something spreading
outward from its Western center. [The new divide was not the West versus
the non-West---which had become untenable---but the liberal democratic
world versus the illiberal world]{.underline}. Modernity empowered both
sides of this political universe. In World War II, the great struggle on
behalf of civilization had been against Nazi Germany, a European power
that was itself employing scientific theories of race to legitimate its
violence and aggression---ideas that had been used in the nineteenth
century to defend European imperial domination over "backward"
non-European peoples.65 In this sense, the old civilizational
justification for two world orders---a Western system of civilized
states and a backward and uncivilized world beyond---did not fail
because non-European peoples gradually joined the "family of civilized
nations." It collapsed when civilized states---Germany, Japan, and
Russia---joined the noncivilized world.66 As I noted in chapter 5, this
shift in thinking occurred in the United States during the war years and
continued during the Cold War. [The rise of fascism and totalitarianism
led Roosevelt and his contemporaries to let go of their notions of
civilization, race, and nation and rethink the nature of liberalism and
modernity. With threats to the liberal capitalist order now coming from
inside the West, what it meant to be civilized could no longer be
defined by race or culture or geography]{.underline}. This sentiment was
captured by Leonard Woolf in a short book published in 1939, Barbarians
at the Gate, in which he argued that civilization was not a geographical
or even a cultural construction but a way of regulating individual
behavior within human communities. Europe might have found a distinctive
approach to restraining violence, tyranny, and predation, but
civilization was distributed more widely around the world---and so too
was the antithesis of civilization, or what Woolf called barbarism.
Writing on the eve of World War II, Woolf argued that "the barbarian is,
therefore, not only at the gates; he is always within the walls of our
civilization, inside our minds and our hearts."67 This new sense that
the dangers to the liberal democratic world came from inside that world
forced American and European internationalists to rethink their
principles and projects. [American liberal internationalists began to
make more serious efforts to separate their project from the legacies of
European imperialism. This separation was driven by evolving ideas about
sovereignty and self-determination, grand shifts in geopolitical
interests, depression, and wartime politics within Western liberal
democracies, as well as by more immediate struggles brought on by the
war and the way it changed the Anglo-American relationship]{.underline}.
The United States did not have the same attachments to empire as the
British, and cracks opened up within the West on whether and how the
world would transition away from empire.68 This was seen most clearly at
the Atlantic Charter meeting in 1941, where Roosevelt and Churchill
disagreed over the future of the British imperial preference system and
the principles of sovereign rights and self-determination.69

#### Liberalism is ideologically opposed to imperialism---the right to self-determination created an anti-colonial feedback loop between liberal democracies, former colonies, and oppressed groups within great powers

[A second force separating liberal internationalism and empire was the
ideas themselves, filtered through political movements both in the
liberal democracies and outside the Western world]{.underline}.
Roosevelt's Four Freedoms and the Atlantic Charter, the most sweeping of
these ideas, can be seen as efforts by wartime democratic leaders to
mobilize their people for war. In this sense, they served an
instrumental purpose. For Roosevelt, the Atlantic Charter was a way to
legitimize for the American people their imminent entrance into the war.
It was an effort to counter Nazi propaganda by offering subjugated
nations and neutrals in Europe a sweeping liberal democratic vision of a
better world to come. [But even if universalist principles are uttered
for instrumental reasons, once they enter into the discourse they become
part of the contested ideological landscape upon which political
struggles are waged.76 To be sure, some liberal internationalists were
deeply committed to presiding over liberalism's separation from
empire]{.underline}. Roosevelt's closest adviser on postwar planning,
Sumner Welles---the driving force behind the Atlantic Charter and later
the United Nations---earnestly sought to use wartime negotiations with
the British to escort Britain's empire offstage. He and other Wilsonians
had spent the 1930s reflecting on the failures of 1919, looking for new
ways to build a cooperative global order that, as Welles put it,
"implies the juridic equality of every nation and the acceptance of a
moral order and of effective international law."77 Welles sought to lay
down principles that would weaken the political standing of empire in
the postwar world.78 [But it was the wider use of self-determination and
sovereign equality that gave these principles impact]{.underline}. This
struggle was waged on many fronts, driven by geopolitical and
ideological clashes and movements within the West and between it and the
non-West. [It is not simply---or primarily---a story of the West
"externalizing" its ideas and institutions to the rest of the world.
NonWestern peoples and societies seized on the principles and
institutions that the West had developed for itself and adapted them for
their own purposes in their struggles for independence]{.underline}.
Witnessing the decolonization movements in 1964, Rupert Emerson observed
that when non-Western people "press for equality, democracy, and the
right of self-determination, they are asking their present and erstwhile
rulers to live up to the ideals which these same rulers have transmitted
to them and proclaimed as their own. . . . [The nationalism which
developed in the imperial West in the nineteenth century, with its
implied right of self-determination, can in this sense be seen as one of
the key sources of anti-colonialism]{.underline}."79 Westphalian and
liberal internationalist ideas were both pushed and pulled into the rest
of the world. The "reception and remolding of Western ideas" by peoples
and societies in the non-West, C. A. Bayly argues, "set limits on the
nature and extent of their domination by European power-holders."80 The
formal and informal unraveling of empire and colonialism is one of the
great dramas of the post-1945 era. [From the 1950s to the early 1960s,
the previous century's era of imperial expansion underwent a radical
reversal]{.underline}. Robin Winks notes, "One after another, the
colonized territories tried to establish their independence from
European control. From Guinea to Somalia, from Morocco to India, the
flags of France, Britain, Italy, Holland, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal
came down. In their place were hoisted newly designed flags of the newly
sovereign states. By the mid-1980s, no substantial area was under
colonial rule, although the radically discriminatory regime prevailed in
the Republic of Africa."81 The predominant view in Europe at the end of
the nineteenth century was that the imperial system would remain the
core organizing logic of world order. Yet, in less than a hundred years,
these empires---along with the Soviet Union---had disappeared.82
[Political movements in the United States and the other liberal
democracies also had a behind-the-scenes impact on their government's
policies toward empire]{.underline}. In the nineteenth century, the
British anti--slave trade movement pressed the Parliament to abolish the
slave trade throughout the British Empire. During and after World War I,
the women's suffrage movement in the United States and Britain became
increasingly active in international affairs. The war itself affected
the lives of women, galvanizing the suffragist movement and illuminating
the role of war in modern society. Many in the movement made a direct
connection between the right to vote and campaigns for peace and
worldwide social justice.83 During the war, women's groups on both sides
of the Atlantic, led by figures such as Jane Addams and Emily Greene
Balch, actively participated in debates on the postwar settlement.84
Together, Addams and Balch became leaders of the Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom, devoted to peace education, international
dialogue, and socially progressive causes, for which they later received
the Nobel Peace Prize.85 [This group and others explicitly linked the
denial of women's rights and social justice in their societies to the
pursuit of militarism and imperialism abroad.]{.underline} During the
1940s, domestic political struggles---particularly over civil
rights---and the continuing activities of progressive movements
reinforced liberal internationalist efforts abroad. [Americans
struggling for civil rights explicitly linked their causes with
anticolonial movements.86]{.underline} The linkage showed itself, for
example, in June 1942, when Walter White, representing the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, met with Sumner
Welles and urged the Roosevelt administration to call a "Pacific
Conference" devoted to ending colonial rule in Asia. White wanted FDR to
meet with Indian leaders such as Nehru and Gandhi and the Chinese
nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek to announce America's support for
Asian statehood and national self-rule. White also suggested that, with
the "Pacific Charter" in hand, a delegation of Americans, led by Wendell
Willkie and a "distinguished American Negro whose complexion
unmistakably identifies him as being a colored man," should go to India
and announce American support for the Indian struggle."87 The idea did
not have great support in the administration. Even those who took issue
with the British Empire were unwilling to take steps that might weaken
Britain's position in the struggle with Nazi Germany. After World War
II, the American civil rights movement and social justice campaigns drew
connections between their struggles and the struggles of nationalist and
anti-imperialists abroad. In 1947, W. E. B. Du Bois used the platform of
the United Nations for "An Appeal to the World," describing the
injustices of racial segregation and inequality in the United States and
associating the struggles of African Americans with the victims of
colonialism in Africa and elsewhere. "Our treatment is not merely an
internal question for the United States," he argued, "it is a basic
problem of humanity."88 [Not only did civil rights activists appeal to
international audiences for support and solidarity, many US political
leaders also saw progress on civil rights as integral to fighting the
Cold War]{.underline}. During these decades, the American government's
relationship to civil rights legislation was shaped by the sense that it
was necessary to manage its international image. As the historian Mary
Dudziak argues, "the need to address international criticism gave the
federal government an incentive to promote social change at home."89
[The connections also ran in the other direction as the American civil
rights movement, along with other social justice advocates, put pressure
on the US government to support anticolonial causes
abroad.90]{.underline}

#### Liberalism is structurally opposed to imperialism---liberal organizations are vehicles for anti-colonial and anti-patriarchal struggle

[Third, the international organizations established after the two world
wars created platforms and capacities that experts and activists could
use in their struggles against empire]{.underline}. While the League of
Nations and, later, the United Nations helped Britain and other European
states secure what remained of their imperial holdings, they also served
as institutional sites for activism and repositories of universalistic
norms and principles that opponents of empire could deploy in their
struggles for self-rule. [Both the league and the United Nations created
institutional channels for groups that previously had little input into
diplomacy or the shaping of international rules and practices to provide
a counterweight to the old imperial order. These groups included women's
organizations, international activists, and non-Western governments and
peoples.91]{.underline} As I have noted, the Great War did not quell the
European appetite for empire, and the League of Nations was widely seen
in Europe and Great Britain as an opportunity to strengthen the prestige
and administration of imperial rule. But the league also played a
role---if a conflicted and awkward one---in moving the world toward the
end of empire and the spread of selfdetermination. "If one considers its
work in stabilizing new states and running the minorities protection and
mandates system," Susan Pedersen argues, "the League appears as a key
agent in the transition from a world of formal empires to a world of
formally sovereign states."92 Pedersen looks specifically at the
league's Permanent Mandates Commission, the system established in 1921
to manage the territories in Africa, the Middle East, and the Pacific
that Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire had lost in the
war. The mandates system did not directly alter the aims of the
remaining imperial powers, which sought to preserve their colonies and
continued to see empire as a civilizing mission. "What was new,"
Pedersen argues, "was the apparatus and the level of international
diplomacy, publicity, and 'talk' that the system brought into being."
The mandates system was a vehicle for "internationalization"---a process
"by which certain political issues and functions are displaced from the
national or imperial, and into the international realm."93 [Unintended
by its architects, the mandates system became a vehicle by which those
favoring self-determination and revision of the Versailles settlement
could press their claims. It provided a platform for internationalists,
humanitarians, nationalists, and others who sought to expose the dark
side of imperial rule.]{.underline} The wider league complex of
institutions had the same effect, drawing international commissions,
organizations, lobbyists, and experts into a sprawling and ongoing
debate about the future of European empire and the normative foundations
of statehood.94 It would take decades and another world war to bring
about a global system of sovereign states. But the league pointed the
way. India took advantage of the League of Nations to gain rights and
recognition before its independence in 1947. Great Britain, in an effort
to strengthen its presence and voting share at Versailles, overcame the
opposition of the other great powers to gain separate representation for
its dominions, including India. Although still a British dependency,
India---along with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South
Africa---actively participated in the conference's deliberations and
signed the peace treaty on the basis of "legal equality."95 Because the
Covenant of the League of Nations was part of the peace treaty, India
acquired the right to become a founding member of the league, the only
state among the thirty-one original members that was not legally
self-governing. India's internal and external relations continued to
rest with the British government, but as one observer notes, "for the
first time in the modern period, \[India\] came into direct and formal
contact with the outside world."96 Between 1919 and 1947, India's
position within the international legal system remains anomalous. While
formally not a sovereign state, India exercised treaty-making power and
participated in almost every international conference after 1920. As a
league member, India attended the Washington Conference on Naval
Armaments in 1921, signed the Washington treaty, and was admitted to the
International Labour Organization, the Permanent Court of International
Justice, and other league-related organizations. It signed numerous
multilateral treaties, including the KelloggBriand Pact of 1928.97 In
1945, India was invited to the San Francisco Conference of the United
Nations, and it became a founding member of the new world organization.
Over this period, India's self-governing status remained limited and
many Indian nationalist leaders saw their country's presence in these
international bodies as a capitulation to British imperialism.
Nonetheless, India took advantage of the status it gained over these
decades to pave the way for independence, consolidating India as a
diplomatic unit and giving its nationalist movement international
recognition.98 [The United Nations was even more explicit in
facilitating the transition away from empire. It formally enshrined the
idea of universal membership in a world of sovereign states and provided
the legal and political framework for the recognition and integration of
new states into the postimperial Westphalian order]{.underline}. As
decolonization accelerated, the United Nations rapidly expanded from 51
original members in 1945, to 100 in September 1961, and to 159 by the
end of 1985. Ironically, the United Nations is widely seen as the
embodiment of internationalist ideas, but its greatest achievement may
be the global triumph of the sovereign state system. Adam Roberts notes
the United Nations' importance in providing a framework for
decolonization: [The UN sometimes assisted the process of decolonization
through referenda, and also through General Assembly resolutions---most
notably the 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples. But its most important contribution was in
providing a framework for entry into international society of the
numerous new and reconstituted states, many of which were intensely
vulnerable. For them, the UN was not just the main means of securing
diplomatic recognition, but also a world stage, a negotiating forum, a
provider of well-paid jobs, and a source of symbolic protection. The UN
embodies principles, including racial equality and the sovereign
equality of states, that were vital to the decolonization
process.99]{.underline}

#### Liberalism is least coercive and self-reflexive

How do we square these contradictory impulses? If liberal
internationalism has offered a vision of a postimperial global order, is
it also implicated in a pattern of liberal interventionism, or liberal
imperialism? [Some critics see liberal internationalism as a fig leaf
with which elites disguise and legitimate more traditional great-power
impulses]{.underline}. The problem with liberal internationalism is that
it does not put a sufficient ideological or political brake on American
interventionism. [Other critics make an even stronger argument---that
liberalism itself drives American interventionism]{.underline}. As
ideologies and political projects, liberalism and liberal
internationalism are inherently revisionist. It is American liberalism
that leads the United States to intervene and seek to reshape other
societies. For realist critics, the liberal sources of American
interventionism look particularly striking since the end of the Cold
War, when the United States emerged unrivaled and undisciplined by the
bipolar balance of power. Equipped with unipolar power and liberal
internationalist ideas, the United States found itself supporting the
expansion of NATO and the European Union, engaging in humanitarian
intervention, projecting itself into regional conflicts and civil wars,
and pursuing violent regime change, most fatefully in the 2003 invasion
of Iraq. The suggestion is that a more realist-oriented America would
have pursued a more restrained vision of the national interest.106 [The
liberal tradition has certainly informed the conduct of American foreign
policy]{.underline}. As I noted in chapter 6, during the Cold War,
liberalism became a "fighting faith" that tied American power to a
global struggle to protect the liberal democratic world when that world
was under attack from powerful illiberal forces. [A great contest
between open societies and totalitarian challengers was an ideological
struggle but also a military and geopolitical struggle]{.underline}.
Leading liberal thinkers of the day, such as Arthur Schlesinger Jr.,
Isaiah Berlin, and Raymond Aron, considered the survival of the
democratic way of life to be at extreme risk. Western liberal
democracies had stumbled in the 1920s and 1930s by failing to respond to
the instabilities and inequalities of capitalist society. In response,
these Cold War liberals, as Jan-Werner Müller argues, sought to "craft a
principled politics of freedom for the twentieth century."107 Their view
of the threats to liberal democracy focused on both the troubled
internal politics of Western societies, where the political center was
threatened by extremism on the Right and the Left, and the wider
world-historical struggle then unfolding with the Soviet Union and
international communism. Schlesinger's influential 1949 book The Vital
Center epitomized this worldview. It offered a defense of pluralism and
open societies and called for the continuation of New Deal--style reform
by activist governments. But in response to the larger global challenge,
Schlesinger urged collective action by the liberal democracies, led by
the United States, to defend their institutions and the liberal
international order from totalitarian rivals.108 The challenge to
liberal democracy was manifest in a worldwide struggle between
alternative visions of modernity. [Cold War liberalism offered a
narrative that put liberal internationalism in the service of an
activist American foreign policy.109]{.underline} Is the American
liberal tradition inherently interventionist? Do liberal principles
predispose the United States to actively seek to impose democracy on
other states? A long tradition of realist thinking has argued that they
do. As Henry Kissinger maintains, "the idea that peace depends above all
on promoting democratic institutions has remained a staple of American
thought to the present day," and he traces this idea back to Woodrow
Wilson.110 The United States is often depicted as a "crusader state"
seeking, under the sway of liberal ideas, to remake the world in its own
image.111 More recently, realist scholars have linked American
liberalism to controversial American foreign policy actions in the wake
of the September 11 terrorist attacks, such as the doctrine justifying
preventive war and forcible regime change. [John Mearsheimer argues that
liberalism provides the impulse and legitimating rationale for repeated
episodes of American military interventionism]{.underline}. Liberal
ambitions spurred the United States to push Western institutions to the
doorsteps of Russia and China and provided the rationale for the
disastrous war in Iraq. Similarly, Michael Desch traces American
interventionism to the founding ideas of liberal internationalism. He
sees Kantian liberalism as providing the philosophical justification for
military efforts to democratize illiberal sovereign states by force. In
effect, the liberal tradition generates what David Hume called an
"imprudent vehemence" toward illiberal regimes.112 [These claims bring
the debate back to the question of whether liberalism contains an "urge"
to empire]{.underline}. Mearsheimer and Desch essentially take the view
of liberalism that is elaborated by Uday Mehta in Liberalism and Empire.
Here it is not empire but military interventionism that the leading
liberal state uses to bring backward people and regimes into the modern
world. Intervention and regime change are embedded in the assumptions
that liberalism makes about the "state of nature" and the conditions for
peace. Only when all states embrace representative government will
liberal democracies be truly safe[. But the urge to intervene to promote
democracy is clearly contingent, not absolute.]{.underline} Most liberal
internationalists would almost certainly agree that, all else being
equal, liberal democracies would be safer in a world dominated by
liberal democracies. But whether this justifies forcible regime change
is another matter. Kant's view of intervention was surely more
complicated---and contingent---than Desch admits. [Kant did believe that
a republican constitution is the ideal, he also acknowledged that even
despotic states have a claim of legitimate authority that entitles them
to nonintervention. Kant did argue that "perpetual peace" depends on all
states developing republican forms of rule, but this does not generate a
right by liberal states to bring about such a result by force.113
Michael Doyle has shown that liberalism is conflicted---even
"congenitally confused"---on the question of intervention]{.underline}.
Liberalism embraces principles that are in tension with each other. [On
one hand, liberal principles accord all states, including illiberal
states, the right to noninterference, even when these states inflict
harm on their own populations or violate their rights. On the other
hand, liberalism also emphasizes that the rights of individuals in these
societies must also be respected, and this opens the door---at least
under extreme conditions---to intervention.114]{.underline} Doyle argues
that Kant "made a strong case for respecting the right of
non-intervention because it afforded a polity the necessary territorial
space and political independence in which free and equal citizens could
work out what their way of life would be."115 But Kant could also
imagine polities that so abused their people---committing massacres or
genocide, for example---that the duty of nonintervention would not
apply. [This contingency, of course, raises the question of how liberal
states should decide whether and how to respond.]{.underline} Liberalism
thus offers arguments for and against intervention. Georg Sørensen has
described these alternative logics as the "liberalism of imposition" and
the "liberalism of restraint."116 [The liberalism of imposition is
manifest in the state's employment of power to expand liberal
principles]{.underline}. John Stuart Mill argues this position when he
writes that noncivilized societies---which he calls "barbarous"
nations---do not observe the rules and traditions of international
morality, and therefore their independence does not merit full respect.
[Liberalism of restraint, Sørensen argues, stresses a different set of
liberal values, such as "pluralism, non-intervention, respect for
others, moderation, and peaceful cooperation on equal
terms."117]{.underline} This is the vision that Gerry Simpson has called
"charter liberalism," with its values embodied in the United Nations
Charter. [States are accorded equality of treatment, their sovereign
independence is respected, and each state is allowed to determine how to
establish its own rights and protections.118 Restraint liberals
recognize that some states will violate basic rights, but until some
extreme line of violence and genocide is crossed diversity is tolerated,
in the belief that over the long run, these societies will evolve toward
universal standards of rights and decency.119]{.underline} These debates
within the liberal tradition burned fiercely during the years
surrounding the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq. How much was
liberal internationalism implicated in this decision? The Bush
administration articulated a sweeping new doctrine of national security
based on American global dominance, the preventive use of force,
"coalitions of the willing," and the struggle between freedom and
tyranny. [In the spring of 2003, this doctrine provided the intellectual
backdrop for the invasion of Iraq. As the invasion turned into a
protracted war, the Bush administration increasingly invoked liberal
internationalist ideas to justify its actions]{.underline}. In his now
famous second inaugural address, George W. Bush stood on the steps of
the US Capitol and proclaimed, "We are led, by events and common sense,
to one conclusion: the survival of liberty in our land increasingly
depends on the success of liberty in other lands."120 The echoes of
Woodrow Wilson and the Cold War liberal internationalism of Truman and
Kennedy were unmistakable. But was Bush truly Wilson's heir? Liberal
internationalists themselves debate this issue.121 Some argue that Bush
followed a "neoconservative" stand of liberal internationalism, focused
on putting the full weight of American power behind bringing the
"blessings of liberty" to oppressed people.122 [Others argue that this
neoconservative turn in American foreign policy was a distortion of
liberal internationalism and that the Bush grand strategy was more
imperial than liberal.]{.underline} Multilateralism is at the heart of
the liberal international vision, these people argue, but the Bush
administration willfully put the United States above the rules and
institutions of the liberal order. In the long run, liberal democracies
will be safer and more secure in an international order undergirded by
shared rules and norms, cooperative security, and mutual restraint---and
the Bush administration was undermining such an order.123 Liberal
internationalists clearly differ on the importance of democracy
promotion to their project, and on whether democracy is best promoted
through force or example.124 But were the ideological origins of the
Iraq War really traceable to liberal internationalism? [The principal
architects of this ill-fated venture were, by all accounts, Vice
President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Deputy
Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz.125 It is difficult to describe the
political ideology of any of these officials as liberal
internationalism]{.underline}. For all three, the primary objective of
the war was the preservation and extension of American primacy in a
region important to American national interests. [They saw Iraq as a
regional revisionist state with a demonstrated record of
chemical-weapons use and a long-standing ambition to acquire nuclear
weapons, making it a military threat to American forces and allies in
the region]{.underline}. The decisive defeat of Iraq was also meant to
provide a worldwide demonstration of America's capacities and
willingness to defend its global position against challengers such as
North Korea and Iran and to dispel lingering doubts created during the
Clinton years about America's willingness to use force. In the decade
before the war, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Wolfowitz had all been associated
with efforts to enunciate a post--Cold War American grand strategy of
preventing the emergence of a peer competitor.126 All three had publicly
urged the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime for more than a decade
before the 2003 invasion. Their utterances betrayed no trace of liberal
internationalism. [Put simply, the Bush administration's policy in Iraq
was decidedly realist.]{.underline} Prominent academic realists opposed
the war, offering eloquent critiques of American hubris and grand
strategy.127 But the case for war was also argued, at least initially,
in realist terms. Democracy promotion was among the rolling rationales
for the war offered by the Bush administration, but it is difficult to
believe that this goal was the originating impulse for the war. It is
more plausibly seen as the administration's public justification for the
war and possibly a template for postwar Iraqi reconstruction. [Democracy
was not a core objective: it emerged later, as a program for making Iraq
into a pillar of the hegemonic American order in the
region.128]{.underline} Some liberal internationalists supported the war
and others opposed it, but many of those supporters were less focused on
democracy promotion than on the genuinely frightening threats that
weapons of mass destruction posed and on the search for responses to
this threat when deterrence and arms control were not effective. (It
turned out, of course, that the reason Hussein could not be persuaded to
give up his weapons of mass destruction was that he had nothing to give
up, and he wanted to hide this fact from neighboring enemies like Iran.)
Finding cooperative solutions to rising problems of security
interdependence was at the top of the post--September 11 liberal
internationalist agenda, but it tended to get lost in the controversies
over the Iraq War.129 Even if one could disentangle American liberalism
from power politics, it is not clear that a purely realist-oriented
foreign policy would be more restrained or enlightened. [There is no
necessary link between liberal internationalism and coercive regime
change. Liberalism may provide reasons to intervene abroad, but it also
provides ideological and institutional mechanisms that restrain the
exercise of military power]{.underline}. Realist critics think they can
prevent another Iraq by removing liberal internationalist ideas from
policymaking. But liberal internationalism also inspired the building of
the wider system of postwar rules, institutions, and partnerships.
Realists cannot assume that this system would have been built in a
purely realist world of offshore balancing. [If the goal is a
"restrained" foreign policy, the postwar system of rules and
institutions that ties the liberal democracies together under shared
commitments and rules of conduct is surely part of the solution and not
the problem.130]{.underline} A large part of the resistance to the Bush
administration's war in Iraq was based on standards of conduct that the
United States had championed. Western Europeans, for example, criticized
the war as a transgression of liberal internationalist notions of
sovereignty, multilateralism, and international law. Two scholars have
called this "liberal anti-Americanism."131 [If military interventionism
is not inherent in either liberalism or realism, the question comes down
to the quality of political institutions and decision making. Does the
United States learn from its mistakes? The lack of enthusiasm for new
Iraqi-style interventions does suggest that foreign policy decision
makers---liberal internationalists or not--- do rethink their
views.]{.underline}

[Finally, the deepest and most far-reaching force separating liberalism
from empire has been the struggle over the global expansion of the
Westphalian state system. A world of sovereign states was a precondition
for the spread of liberal internationalism. Therefore, the struggle to
extend sovereign rights of statehood to peoples and nations was the real
bulwark against empire]{.underline}. By building on and reinforcing this
grand shift from empire to the nation-state, liberal internationalism
ultimately placed its "project" within the Westphalian system---it
became, in a sense, the set of ideas for organizing the world once the
world finally shed its imperial foundations. Empire had ordered the
world for centuries, and when the twentieth century asked what would
replace empire as the world's organizing logic, liberal internationalism
stepped forward as the alternative. How the Westphalian state system
came to encompass the world is a question that still requires scholarly
attention.100 The sovereign state arrived quite late for most regions
outside the West---essentially in the twentieth century, after the world
wars. [For most of the past five hundred years, European great powers
were not eager to export or universalize the Westphalian order. They
held on to empire and colonies until forced to give them up. In this
sense, the spread of Westphalia is not a story of the imposition of a
Western idea on the rest of the world, but of the failure of the
European state system to sustain empire.101 To pursue movements for
independence and selfdetermination on their own, peoples and societies
outside Europe took advantage of the cracks and clashes in the European
imperial system.]{.underline} As noted earlier, Edward Keene argues that
great wars between liberal and totalitarian states discredited the old
civilizational vision of sovereignty and imperial hierarchy. Christian
Reus-Smit finds, in the universalization of norms of sovereignty and
self-determination after two hundred years of struggles over individual
rights, a story of the "evolution and transmission of the legitimating
institutions that sustain sovereignty."102 This surely is part of the
explanation. But it remains to be explained why empires, as a form of
global order, failed. John Darwin argues that empires have tended to
fail for four reasons: "external defeat or geopolitical weakness;
ideological contagion and the loss of legitimacy; domestic enfeeblement
at the centre of empire---the loss of political will and economic
capacity; and colonial revolt."103 All of these triggers of imperial
crisis seemed to be present in the twentieth century. Considered as wars
of empire, the world wars decisively weakened and brought to an end the
European system of empire. [In this drama, the United States played an
important role in both undercutting empire and promoting the Westphalian
state system. It did this first during the two world wars, by joining
and later leading coalitions of allies that ultimately defeated states
with expansive imperial projects]{.underline}. In World War I it was
Imperial Germany, which had conquered a large area of Eastern Europe and
seized much of the Russian Empire's western territories. This war
resulted in the collapse of four long-established European empires:
Romanov Russia, Habsburg Austria-Hungary, Hohenzollern Germany, and
Ottoman Turkey. World War II effectively finished off the Japanese
empire and severely weakened the British and French empires, though the
latter two, because they were on the winning side, took a couple of
decades to dissolve. During the Cold War, the United States also engaged
in balancing against the Soviet Union---seeking to contain the expansion
of Soviet power and influence as well as thwarting communist coups and
revolutions in many weak, independent states. [At the same time, as
noted earlier, the United States played a variety of roles in
facilitating states' ability to survive as independent members of
international society. It led efforts to institutionalize Westphalian
norms of nonaggression and sovereign independence, first with the League
of Nations and then with the United Nations Charter]{.underline}. In the
second half of the twentieth century, the American-led international
order institutionalized open trade and multilateral cooperation,
providing the infrastructure for a global economic system, which in turn
strengthened the smaller states' ability to sustain their sovereignty.
[Also in the second half of the twentieth century, the American system
of military alliances dampened violent conflicts among allied states,
particularly in Europe and East Asia, and this prevented the Westphalian
system from falling back into violent conflict and empire building.104
Thus the "American century" was also the century of the global spread of
the nation-state.]{.underline} They were different political projects,
but each helped the other gain ground.
