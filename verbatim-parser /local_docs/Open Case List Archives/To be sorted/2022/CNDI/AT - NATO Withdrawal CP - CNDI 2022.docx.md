## NATO Good

### Impact

#### Collapse of NATO causes increased Russia aggression and terrorism, economic collapse, and more.

[The most catastrophic impact of NATO's retirement would be the risk of
**Russian aggression** and **miscalculation**]{.underline}. [Without a
clear commitment to defend allied territory backed up by an **American
nuclear deterrent**]{.underline}, President Vladimir Putin will
certainly see opportunities to seize land he believes is Russian. He has
already done this in Georgia and Ukraine. Had they not joined NATO, [the
Baltic states would probably]{.underline} already [be occupied by
Russian troops]{.underline}. Certainly Putin would also see an
opportunity to seize more of Ukraine without the "shadow" of NATO to
protect it.

History teaches us that major wars start when aggressive leaders
miscalculate. German leader Adolf Hitler attacked Poland in 1939,
believing that after then-British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's
Munich Agreement, England would be unlikely to respond. North Korea
attacked South Korea in 1950 after the United States appeared to remove
Seoul from its defensive perimeter. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait in 1990, believing the United States had signaled that it would
not respond.

In each case, miscalculation led to larger conflict.

Secondly, [NATO's retirement would also decrease American military
reach]{.underline}, its political influence **[and its economic
advantage]{.underline}**. [American bases throughout Europe not only
provide for the defense of Europe]{.underline} --- [they bring the U.S.
a continent closer to trouble spots]{.underline} [that threaten vital
**American interests**]{.underline}. [Fighting the Islamic
State]{.underline} group, clearly an American interest, [would have been
markedly more difficult]{.underline} without permanent U.S. bases in
Europe and without the American-built coalition that included every NATO
nation. [Without NATO, the mutual security interests that underpin both
U.S. bases and coalition operations would be undermined.]{.underline}

This extends to the economic realm. [U.S. annual trade in goods and
services with Europe exceeds **\$1 trillion**]{.underline}, and U.S.
total direct investment in Europe nears \$3 trillion. [These economic
ties enhance U.S. prosperity and provide American jobs]{.underline}, but
they require the degree of security now provided by NATO to endure.

NATO's retirement would thirdly exacerbate divisions within Europe.
[NATO's glue not only holds European militaries together]{.underline}
--- it provides the principal forum to discuss and coordinate security
issues. The European Union is unlikely to substitute for NATO in this
respect because it has no military structure, few capabilities and no
superpower leadership to bring divergent views together.

Germany and France already seek a plan B should NATO collapse, but
without the United Kingdom in the European Union, an all-European
approach is likely to fail. The added insecurity of NATO's collapse
would also amplify current populist movements in Europe. The consequence
could be renationalization of European militaries, a system that brought
conflict to the 19th and early 20th centuries.

The fourth consequences of life without NATO would be global. [American
bilateral alliances in Asia would each be shaken]{.underline} to their
core **[should NATO fail]{.underline}**. [America's defense commitments
there would become worthless]{.underline}. With China determined to
claim a dominant position in Asia, [the collapse of NATO would cause
America's Asian partners to **seek accommodation with
China**]{.underline}, much as the Philippines is in the process of
doing.

Trump's decision to abandon the economic Trans-Pacific Partnership
agreement has already given China new advantages in the region. Without
credible American security commitments, [there would be little to stop
China from controlling the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea]{.underline} and
probably occupying Taiwan as well. Add to this equation the new
footholds that China is building in central Asia, Africa and Europe:
[Abandoning NATO would help assure China's competitive
success.]{.underline}

The final impact of NATO's retirement would be [the near collapse of
what has been called the **"liberal international order."**]{.underline}
This order consists of treaties, alliances, agreements, institutions and
modes of [behavior mostly created by the **U**nited **S**tates in an
effort to safeguard democracies.]{.underline}

This order has kept relative peace in the trans-Atlantic space for seven
decades. The Trump administration has begun to unravel elements of this
order in the naive notion that they undercut American sovereignty. [The
entire European project is built on the edifice of this order. NATO is
its principal keystone.]{.underline} [Collapsing this edifice would
undercut]{.underline} the multiple structures that have brought seven
**[decades of peace and prosperity]{.underline}**.

### Prevents Russian Expansion \-\-- 2AC

#### American power in Europe protects it from Russian encroachment and eastern European nuclear proliferation.

The argument isn't wholly wrong. Putin's wars are indeed meant, in part,
to push Western influence back from Russia's frontiers. But [the idea
that NATO expansion is the root of today's problems is morally and
**geopolitically bizarre.**]{.underline}

Far from being a historic blunder, [NATO expansion was one of the great
American successes of the post-Cold War era]{.underline}. [Far from
being the act of a domineering superpower]{.underline}, [it was part of
a long tradition of vulnerable states]{.underline} begging to [join
America's liberal empire]{.underline}. And far from posing a mortal
threat to Moscow, [NATO enlargement actually **provided Russia with far
greater security**]{.underline} than it could have provided itself.

NATO was founded in 1949 with 12 members in Western Europe and North
America. It gradually added additional states --- Turkey, Greece, West
Germany, Spain --- over the course of the Cold War. But the big bang of
enlargement came once the superpower conflict ended. NATO incorporated
the former East Germany into the alliance in 1990; it then added three
Eastern European countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic) in
1999; then seven more, including the Baltic states, in 2004.

To understand why NATO grew so rapidly, we have to remember something
that nearly everyone has now forgotten: There was no guarantee that
Europe would be mostly stable, peaceful and democratic after the Cold
War. In fact, [many of the analysts who now view NATO expansion as a
catastrophe once warned that a post-Cold War Europe could become a
**violent hellscape**]{.underline}.

It wasn't an outlandish scenario. A reunified Germany might once again
try to dominate its neighbors; the old enmity between Moscow and Berlin
could reignite. The collapse of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe could
liberate those states to pursue long-suppressed territorial claims and
nationalist agendas. Ethnic tensions and nuclear proliferation might
explode as the Cold War order crumbled.

If the U.S. pulled back once the Soviet threat was gone, there would be
no extra-European superpower to put out fires on a continent with lots
of geopolitical kindling. "The prospect of major crises, even wars, in
Europe is likely to increase dramatically," Mearsheimer predicted in
1990.

[NATO enlargement was the **logical answer** to these
fears]{.underline}. Expansion was a way of binding a reunified Germany
to the West and surrounding it with democratic allies. [Joining NATO
required new members to lay aside any revanchist designs]{.underline},
[while allowing them to pursue economic and political reforms rather
than investing heavily in military capabilities to defend their newly
won autonomy]{.underline}.

[NATO's move to the east]{.underline} also **[ensured that
Poland]{.underline}** [and other states that easily **could have built
nuclear weapons didn't** need to]{.underline}, [because they had
American protection]{.underline}. Most important, [enlargement kept the
U.S. firmly planted in Europe]{.underline}, by preventing the
centerpiece of the transatlantic relationship from becoming obsolete.

No other initiative could have accomplished these objectives.
Partnership for Peace --- a series of loose security cooperation
agreements with former Soviet-bloc states --- didn't offer the ironclad
guarantees that came with NATO membership. (If you want to understand
the difference between "security partner" and "NATO ally," just look at
what is happening today to Ukraine, one of the former.)

The idea of creating a pan-European security architecture (one that
included Russia) had the same defect; plus, it would have given Moscow
veto power over the security arrangements of the countries the Soviet
Union had so recently dominated.

Only [American power and promises could provide **stability in
Europe**]{.underline}, and [NATO was the continent's critical
link]{.underline} to the U.S. Since 1949, Washington had tamped down
rivalries between old enemies such as France and Germany, [while also
**protecting them from external threats**]{.underline}. After 1991,
[NATO expansion took this **zone of peace**]{.underline}, prosperity and
cooperation that had emerged in Western Europe and moved it into Eastern
Europe as well.

The revolutionary nature of this achievement seemed obvious not so long
ago. "Why has Europe been so peaceful since 1989?" Mearsheimer asked in
2010. The answer, he acknowledged, was because "[America has continued
to serve as **Europe's pacifier**]{.underline}," [**protecting the
continent from dangers** within and without]{.underline}.

#### NATO division is good for Russia.

withdrawing from NATO. That would be great for Russia." January 15,

Trump's **[antipathy toward NATO is a good thing for
Russia]{.underline}**, [whether he ultimately withdraws from the
agreement]{.underline} (which would require a one-year notification
period and likely see pushback from Congress) or not. [**Moscow benefits
from divides** between the US and Europe, and **Putin has been trying to
undermine ties** between the two for years.]{.underline}
