[The professionals who track American attitudes toward the economy say
they can see the trouble coming]{.underline}. [**Angry voters slammed by
higher prices and scarred by two years of fighting the pandemic are
poised to punish Democrats in midterm elections**, according to some of
the leading experts in consumer sentiment and behavior.]{.underline}
[And with inflation persisting and Russia's war on Ukraine stoking
uncertainty, there are indications that public sentiment is getting
worse, not better, posing a growing threat to Democrats' already slim
chances of holding onto Congress]{.underline}, they say. The widely
watched University of Michigan [consumer confidence survey recently
touched its lowest level in almost 11 years]{.underline}. A survey by
The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed that
[almost 70 percent of Americans think the economy is in poor shape, and
81 percent of those in a poll released by CNBC see a recession coming
this year]{.underline}. Gallup **[found the share of Americans citing
inflation as the top issue is now at its highest level since the
1980s]{.underline}**. "The big run-up in gas and food and home prices
has really caused great hardship for many households," said Richard
Curtin, a veteran economist who has run the University of Michigan
consumer survey since 1976. "And the Biden administration made a
critical error in saying it would be transient and people should just
tough it out. It wasn't transient. A lot of people couldn't just tough
it out. And [it caused a big loss of confidence in \[President Joe
Biden's\] policies."]{.underline} Inside the West Wing, Biden and his
top advisers know that the window to change the economic narrative
through executive action is rapidly closing, according to a senior Biden
aide and an outside adviser. The options, they say, mostly include
whatever can be done to ease oil prices, the biggest drag on the party
right now. But even that could have only limited impact. Mark Zandi, the
chief economist at Moody's Analytics and lead author of a closely
followed model that ties political outcomes to economic conditions, said
this is among the toughest environments for the incumbent party that
he's ever seen, despite a booming job market. Moody's is working on its
model for the 2022 midterms, and Zandi said that **[as of now it's
likely to show a very tough path for Democrats to hold either the House,
where they have a razor-thin margin, and the Senate, which is split
50-50.]{.underline}** ["Most Americans have never experienced high
inflation like this, particularly on gas prices, and it has gotten
everyone very upset]{.underline}," he said. ["Behavioral economics
reveals that people hate inflation more than they love a low
unemployment rate. And the pandemic still colors everything. People have
been through the wringer."]{.underline} None of this is lost on
Democratic aides and economists inside and outside the White House. One
senior Biden aide, who declined to be identified by name because they
were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said efforts to
free up more oil and further ease supply chain bottlenecks would
continue. And the president will point to strong positives in the
economy including continued strong job growth, a large number of
available positions, higher wages and a jobless rate of just 3.6
percent, a pandemic low. Most of those numbers are far better than
economists were predicting a year ago. "There are still things we can do
and arguments we can make, but frankly it would have been better had
Vladimir Putin not invaded Ukraine," the aide said. The White House did
not immediately respond to requests for comment. Inflation was rapidly
rising long before the war suddenly sent energy and food prices spiking
even more and injected new volatility into global markets that were
previously celebrating the end to the worst of the pandemic. Still,
other indicators were trending the administration's way. Austan
Goolsbee, a University of Chicago professor who served as a top adviser
to then-President Barack Obama, said the economy looks like it will be a
headwind for Democrats. But he said some things could go right between
now and Election Day in November. "There are still some glimmers of
light for the White House right now," Goolsbee said. "Supply chain
pressures really may ease up. And the virus, which was way worse than
expected, has been the primary driver of everything. And if we are in
fact going to get out from under the grip of the virus, that should
reverse some of the sourness that is now in all the polling and consumer
surveys." There is a lot to reverse, at least according to the latest
survey conducted by The AP-NORC Center. "With energy and consumer prices
on the rise, 69 percent consider the national economy to be in poor
condition," Marjorie Connelly, a senior fellow in public affairs and
media research at NORC at the University of Chicago, said in a note.
"Fifty-five percent say they don't blame ... Biden for high gasoline
prices, but 65 percent disapprove of how he is handling the economy.
Americans are more likely to think his policies have done more to hurt
the national economy than to help it." The survey offered some reason
for optimism for Democrats, given that a majority of Americans don't
blame Biden for the higher gas prices. The numbers also generally break
down along partisan lines in most polling, with **[Republicans more
likely to blame the president for economic problems. People also mostly
still feel confident in their own personal finances even as they worry
about other people and the national picture, the survey said. And they
worry a lot]{.underline}**. "It's just a tough road for Biden and
Democrats to hoe right now," said Curtin.

#### NATO cooperation gives Biden a chance to divert voters towards something favorable just as he struggles with economic messaging

6-27-2022

WASHINGTON --- When President Joe Biden delivers his first official
State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, the unified global
response to Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine is poised to overshadow
the other major theme of the speech: Biden's economic agenda.

**[Biden]{.underline}** and his team **[spent months working on the
economic agenda portion]{.underline}** of the hour-long speech,
according to White House aides. The result is a "strong case" for Biden
**[to make about how well the U.S. economy has rebounded]{.underline}**
in the past year, they said. By contrast, **[aides had just days to pull
together]{.underline}** his **[comments on Russia and
Ukraine]{.underline}** --- a war that is changing by the minute. If this
were any other year, a presidential speech on the nationwide economic
recovery and his future domestic agenda would be more likely to resonate
with American voters than a speech about a foreign war thousands of
miles away. **[But]{.underline}** this year is different. **[Voters
still don't see the economic recovery]{.underline}** Biden will be
addressing an electorate that polls show consistently feels disconnected
from the economic recovery that Biden has overseen in his first year in
office. The numbers are clear: **[Since Biden took office last January,
the U.S. economy has achieved the fastest job growth on record and the
fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years.]{.underline}** A Washington
Post ABC poll released last week found that **[75% of Americans believed
the economy is]{.underline}** in **[either "poor" or "not so
good"]{.underline}** shape. **[This disconnect is not
new.]{.underline}** For months, **[Biden has insisted]{.underline}** ---
and the numbers have shown --- that **[America is undergoing a period of
historic economic growth. But this has]{.underline}** nonetheless
**[failed to resonate with voters]{.underline}**, a majority of whom
feel pessimistic about the economy and frustrated at high inflation.
Biden's speech will acknowledge these anxieties on Tuesday, said a White
House official. But he will not be unveiling any novel approaches to the
problem. Instead, Biden will "call on Congress" to pass various elements
of his "Build Back Better" bill, but won't refer to the doomed bill by
name. Biden's hope of passing the once-in-a-generation social safety net
expansion collided late last year with West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe
Manchin's alarm over rising inflation. Manchin cited inflation as the
reason why he pulled his support for the bill after it had already
passed the House. Biden will "call on Congress" at least 10 times in
Tuesday's address to pass various proposals, according to a White House
fact sheet on the speech. They include everything from increased funding
for Pell grants to a \$15 minimum wage to paid family leave. Still, the
fact that Biden is resorting to public pressure on the Democratically
controlled Senate and House, asking them to take action, only serves to
highlight the hurdles Biden faces to fully enacting his legislative
agenda. A decisive response **[While Biden's domestic policy agenda
appears to be mired in intraparty squabbles, it is a very different
story 6,000 miles away in Ukraine.]{.underline}** On Ukraine, **[Biden
and his foreign policy team are leading the rest of the world,
revitalizing the NATO alliance and stepping up to the challenge that
Putin poses to the rules-based international order]{.underline}** ---
one that has maintained relative peace in Europe for nearly 80 years. On
Tuesday morning, tens of thousands of Russian troops were surrounding
the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. Farther to the east, Russian forces shelled
a public square in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, killing
hundreds. In response to the invasion, a loose coalition of large and
small democracies around the world has banded together to impose severe
restrictions on Russia's central bank and sanctioned its richest
citizens, its airlines and its state-run media. The goal of the effort
is to isolate Moscow and force the Kremlin to pay a high price
economically for launching a war of choice. **[Biden and the United
States have been at the forefront of this coalition]{.underline}**,
which includes G-7 members, NATO allies, rich countries like Japan and
developing countries like Ghana and even traditionally neutral countries
like Switzerland and Monaco. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said
Biden will "talk about the steps we've taken to not only support the
Ukrainian people with military and economic assistance, but also the
steps he's taken to build a global coalition imposing crippling
financial sanctions on President \[Vladimir\] Putin, his inner circle
and the Russian economy." Biden will also address "the importance of the
United States as a leader in the world --- standing up for values and
standing up for global norms" she told reporters Monday. In just the
past week, Biden has held scores of leader-to-leader calls with U.S. and
NATO allies to coordinate both U.S. support for Ukraine and sanctions on
Russia. He has also deployed thousands of U.S. troops to help shore up
the defenses of NATO member states to whom Russia poses the most
immediate threat. At the same time, Biden's secretaries of state and
defense have requested and distributed hundreds of millions of dollars
worth of additional weapons to Ukrainian troops, and humanitarian aid to
refugees fleeing the front lines. **[This combined U.S. military,
diplomatic, economic and humanitarian response has earned praise for
Biden from both Democrats and Republicans.]{.underline}** "President
**[Biden's leadership]{.underline}** in the Ukraine crisis **[has been
truly impressive," conservative]{.underline}** intellectual **[Bill
Kristol tweeted]{.underline}** on Monday. Even more importantly,
**[early polls show that average Americans of all parties are coalescing
around their support]{.underline}** for Ukraine and opposition to
Russia's invasion. **[For Republican voters to back Biden's
position]{.underline}** on anything **[is exceedingly
rare]{.underline}**, and **[all the more so because]{.underline}** the
most recent Republican president, Donald **[Trump, was such an ardent
supporter and defender of Putin.]{.underline}**

**[Stocks are off to a rocky start so far this year]{.underline}**
thanks to a laundry list of challenges including inflation spikes and
interest rate hikes. **[Midterm elections in November are going to make
2022 even trickier]{.underline}** by adding yet another layer of
uncertainty to the investing mix. **[Consumer prices are surging with
inflation at nearly 40-year highs, supply chain issues continue to
persist and coronavirus cases are spiking]{.underline}** due to the
Omicron variant. What's more, the Federal Reserve has started tightening
monetary policy in a bid to control inflation: Once the central bank
finishes tapering its monthly asset purchases in March, it intends to
hike interest rates three times later this year--something it hasn't
done since 2018. **["The worst that can happen for Democrats is if they
lose control over both houses of Congress. In that case the market would
win by losing, and see]{.underline}** a slightly **[improved average
performance."]{.underline}** Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at
CFRA Research Come November, Republicans are hoping to win back control
of either the House of Representatives or the Senate. They'll need five
seats to win a majority in the House and one seat in the Senate.
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia and Florida all have key
elections that could determine whether or not Congress flips. **["The
most favorable outcome for markets would be a Republican win in both the
House and the Senate," says Jeremy Siegel]{.underline}**, the Russell E.
Palmer Professor of Finance **[at the Wharton School]{.underline}** of
the University of Pennsylvania. "If Republicans take the House and not
the Senate, that would also be a relatively favorable outcome." To find
out how various election results would impact stocks, Forbes analyzed
market data going back to 1945 with the help of CFRA Research. In short,
**[when it comes to stock market performance]{.underline}**, Democratic
presidents have an edge. From 1945 through the end of 2021, the compound
annual growth rate for the S&P 500 has been 9.4% under Democratic
presidents compared with 6.6% for Republican commanders-in-chief. **[The
best returns]{.underline}**, however, **[have come under Democratic
presidents kept in check by a split or Republican Congress.
"Historically, investors prefer shared power across the Federal
government,"]{.underline}** says RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas. For
instance, **[President Barack Obama faced a split Congress from November
2010 to 2014]{.underline}**, with Republicans holding the House of
Representatives while Democrats held the Senate. Equity investors
weren't complaining: **[The S&P 500 surged nearly 70%]{.underline}**
during that period. Markets historically prefer Democratic presidents
kept in check by a split Republican Congress. The S&P 500 average return
in years where Democrats have simultaneously held the Oval Office and
both houses of Congress is 10.5%. While those returns are nothing to
balk at, the best-case scenario for investors---with a 13.6% average
gain for the S&P 500---is when a Democratic president is presiding over
a split Congress. **[The second-best performance, with a 13% average
gain: A Democratic president working with a unified Republican
Congress.]{.underline}** "The worst that can happen for Democrats is if
they lose control over both houses of Congress," says Sam Stovall, chief
investment strategist for CFRA Research. "In that case the market would
win by losing---meaning that Wall Street will see a slightly improved
average performance." **[One thing to consider if Democrats lose: Less
government spending. President Joe Biden and Democrats will be
significantly less likely to pass big legislation if Republicans gain
control of either the House or Senate.]{.underline}** Markets often like
big government spending. Consider that stocks surged after the Biden
administration passed its \$1.2 trillion infrastructure bill last
November while stimulus spending gave markets room to run as the S&P 500
gained 26% in the 12 months following March 2020. Democrats' latest
piece of budget legislation, the Build Back Better Act, includes more
infrastructure and climate spending but has been stalled for months
after stalwart opposition from Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va). With
midterms looming---and Democrats' prospects not exactly looking
rosy---BBB would need to be pushed through before November since it's
unlikely to pass if Republicans take the House or Senate. That means
less spending for markets to bank on. So, how will stocks fare between
now and November? Years with midterm elections tend to have weaker stock
market returns overall. The second year of a presidential cycle has some
"unique characteristics and none of them are favorable for investors,"
says James Stack, president of InvesTech Research and Stack Financial
Management. The second years of presidential terms, which Stovall refers
to as the "sophomore slump," produce the lowest average S&P 500
return---just 4.9%. Further, the second and third quarter of midterm
years result in the worst returns, declining on average 1.8% and 0.5%,
respectively. 2022 could be worse than average given worries about
inflation, Covid variants, supply chain delays and the Federal Reserve's
tightening monetary policy. "There's nothing that the market dislikes
more than uncertainty---and that will lead to an increase in volatility,
especially in 2022," says Stack who emphasizes that monetary policy
could spook markets even more than expected thanks to the Fed's plan to
rapidly shrink its balance sheet. "Risk has seldom if ever been higher
from a valuation standpoint---and now that's significantly increasing
from a monetary standpoint," he says. There is some good news on the
horizon though. **[Historical data shows that the fourth quarter of
midterm years and first quarter of the following year boast the two
strongest returns of the entire presidential cycle, rising 6.1% and 7.5%
on average, respectively. "By then we will also have had at least one if
not two interest rate hikes and investors will realize the world hasn't
come to an end,"]{.underline}** Stovall says. The equity party continues
well into a president's third year in office when there's a push to
stimulate the economy ahead of the next election. It's no coincidence
that the best market returns come during that period; the S&P 500 rises
an average 16% in that third year. What's more, in the six months after
midterm elections---from November to April---the S&P 500 has gained
14.3% on average and has risen in price 95% of the time. "Very often
you\'ll see a positive reaction to midterm elections regardless of which
party wins," says Stack.

#### Economic decline causes nuclear war

Stein **Tønnesson 15**, Research Professor, Peace Research Institute
Oslo; Leader of East Asia Peace program, Uppsala University, 2015,
"Deterrence, interdependence and Sino--US peace," International Area
Studies Review, Vol. 18, No. 3, p. 297-311

Several **[recent works]{.underline}** on China and Sino--US relations
**[have made]{.underline}** substantial **[contributions to the current
understanding of how and under what circumstances]{.underline}** a
combination of **[nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence may
reduce the risk of war between major powers]{.underline}**. At least
four conclusions can be drawn from the review above: first, those who
say that **[interdependence may both inhibit and drive
conflict]{.underline}** are right. **[Interdependence raises the cost of
conflict]{.underline}** for all sides **[but]{.underline}**
**[asymmetrical or unbalanced dependencies and negative trade
expectations]{.underline}** may **[generate tensions leading to trade
wars among inter-dependent states that]{.underline}** in turn
**[increase the risk of military conflict]{.underline}** (Copeland,
2015: 1, 14, 437; Roach, 2014). The risk may increase if one of the
interdependent countries is governed by an inward-looking socio-economic
coalition (Solingen, 2015); second, the risk of war between China and
the US should not just be analysed bilaterally but include their allies
and partners. Third party countries could drag China or the US into
confrontation; third, in this context it is of some comfort that the
three main economic powers in Northeast Asia (China, Japan and South
Korea) are all deeply integrated economically through production
networks within a global system of trade and finance (Ravenhill, 2014;
Yoshimatsu, 2014: 576); and fourth, **[decisions for war]{.underline}**
and peace **[are taken by very few people, who act on the basis of their
future expectations]{.underline}**. International relations theory must
be supplemented by foreign policy analysis in order to assess the value
attributed by national decision-makers to economic development and their
assessments of risks and opportunities. **[If leaders]{.underline}** on
either side of the Atlantic **[begin to seriously fear or anticipate
their own nation's decline]{.underline}** then **[they may
blame]{.underline}** this on **[external dependence, appeal to
anti-foreign sentiments, contemplate the use of force to
gain]{.underline}** respect or **[credibility, adopt protectionist
policies, and]{.underline}** ultimately **[refuse to be deterred
by]{.underline}** either **[nuclear arms or prospects of socioeconomic
calamities. Such a dangerous shift could happen abruptly]{.underline}**,
i.e. under the instigation of actions by a third party -- or against a
third party. Yet as long as there is both nuclear deterrence and
interdependence, the tensions **[in East Asia]{.underline}** are
unlikely to escalate to war. As Chan (2013) says, all states in the
region are aware that they cannot count on support from either China or
the US if they make provocative moves. **[The greatest risk is
not]{.underline}** that **[a territorial dispute]{.underline}** leads to
war under present circumstances **[but that changes in the world economy
alter those circumstances in ways that render inter-state peace more
precarious]{.underline}**. If China and the US fail to rebalance their
financial and trading relations (Roach, 2014) then a trade war could
result, interrupting transnational production networks, provoking social
distress, and exacerbating nationalist emotions. **[This could have
unforeseen consequences in the field of security, with nuclear
deterrence remaining the only factor to protect the world from
Armageddon, and unreliably so]{.underline}**. **[Deterrence could lose
its credibility]{.underline}**: one of the two **[great powers might
gamble that the other yield in a cyber-war or
conventional]{.underline}** limited **[war]{.underline}**, or third
party countries might engage in conflict with each other, with a view to
obliging Washington or Beijing to intervene.

### Readiness

#### GOP victory increases readiness through defense spending, hardline stances, energy independence

is Going On? 6-2-2022 The Republicans Could Win the U.S. Midterms.
Here's What that Means for the World. Foreign Policy
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/02/gop-congress-midterms-foreign-policy-ukraine-taiwan/\]
6-27-2022

Last month's vote in the U.S. Congress to appropriate \$40 billion in
additional military and budgetary assistance for Ukraine laid bare
fissures in the Republican congressional caucus: 11 of 50 Senate
Republicans voted against the bill, as did 57 of 208 House Republicans.
Was the Ukraine vote a harbinger of Republican national security
squabbles to come? Was it a partisan vote against anything associated
with President Joe Biden? Or was it a one-off reflecting a poorly
drafted bill with too much extraneous baggage? More importantly, who
will hold the foreign-policy reins in the likely Republican House (and
possibly Senate) majority to come in 2023---the isolationists or the
internationalists? **[Political pundits agree Republicans are likely to
win back the House of Representatives and have a good shot at the Senate
in the November 2022 midterm elections.]{.underline}** That
could---caucus permitting---propel House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy
to the speakership and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to the
post of majority leader. Of the two, McConnell is the known
quantity---an experienced legislator and parliamentarian and an
old-school internationalist whose foreign-policy views were forged in
the crucible of the Cold War. McCarthy, not so much. Indeed, it's
probably most accurate to say his foreign policy was forged in the
crucible of former President Donald Trump. As previous Republican
speakers have learned to their displeasure, the Republican Party in
today's House is less a caucus and more a raucous battle for primacy.
Former Speaker John Boehner struggled against rebellious Tea Party
upstarts, his successor Paul Ryan struggled against the self-named
Freedom Caucus, and McCarthy is unlikely to have much fun either. In the
minority, the Republican Party tends---emphasis intended---to stand
together because the Democratic speaker and the executive in the White
House are deemed public enemies No. 1 and No. 2. But with the majority
comes the battle to control the agenda. Domestic policy will likely
dominate the politicking in Congress: inflation, crime, education, the
border. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine, like so many conflicts before
it, has proved that as much as politicians wish to focus on "nation
building here at home," global realities intrude. Ukraine is the tip of
the iceberg, but **[Republicans have their eye on]{.underline}** plenty
of other issues as well, including relations with
**[China]{.underline}**, the question of **[defending
Taiwan]{.underline}**, the continued **[isolation of
Russia]{.underline}**, the Middle East (think **[energy, Iran, and
Israel]{.underline}**), **[and]{.underline}**, more
**[broad]{.underline}**ly, **[defense spending]{.underline}**. But
before the substance of the foreign-policy challenge hits the House and
Senate floors, the ideological question merits examination. American
Enterprise Institute scholar Colin Dueck divides the Republican Party's
foreign policy into three schools: foreign-policy activists,
foreign-policy hard-liners, and foreign-policy noninterventionists.
Looking back, it's clear that so-called foreign-policy activists
dominated Republican national security policymaking for much of the
post-World War II era. These were the leaders who believed, as both
Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush regularly underscored, that
the United States is not simply one nation among many but that it is a
beacon of freedom to the world, a "shining city on a hill."
Foreign-policy activists underwrote the Reagan Doctrine, the principle
that the United States should lend a hand to all those hoping to halt
the advance of communism wherever they were, including in Afghanistan,
Nicaragua, Angola, El Salvador, and Grenada. Bush faced different
challenges, but his underlying faith in U.S. power and values was
similar. Rather than fighting communism, what Bush dubbed his "Freedom
Agenda" took on the tyrannies that he believed fueled Salafi-jihadis.
Yet his efforts were neither clearly thought through nor appropriately
resourced. Worse yet, Bush could not convincingly argue that he was
advancing U.S. national interests in every case. For the activist
school, Bush's Iraq War proved to be their swan song. Though the Iraq
War offered an "I told you so" moment for the Republican Party's
isolationist wing, its immediate beneficiaries were President Barack
Obama and the Democratic Party's own "End the endless wars" crowd---or
so it seemed at first. But the intervening years offered the Republican
Party's noninterventionists ample fodder: the disastrous war in Libya
and the horrifying killing of a U.S. ambassador in Benghazi, the
withdrawal from Iraq and the resulting rise of the Islamic State, the
civil war in Syria and the ensuing cataclysmic refugee crisis. These
crises were not the primary reason for Trump's election, but they didn't
hurt his campaign. Rather, they---together with Obama's self-labeled
signature foreign-policy achievement, the Iran nuclear deal---offered an
opportunity for Trump. "Donald **[Trump]{.underline}**'s political
achievement in 2016 was to sense the possibility for a new
\[Republican\] coalition unseen since before World War II," Dueck
writes. "He did this not by reiterating libertarian foreign-policy
preferences. Rather, he **[combined non-interventionist criticism of
'endless wars' with hardline stands on China, jihadist terrorism,
anti-American dictatorships in Latin America, and US defense
spending]{.underline}**." **[This is a sweet spot for Republican foreign
policy, and understanding the reluctant internationalism of most of the
party's voters---a repudiation of the embarrassed anti-Americanism of
the Democratic Party's far left]{.underline}** and the activist
internationalism that has heretofore characterized the Republican Party
leadership---will be key to geolocating a new Republican Congress's
preferred national security policy. **[A unifying theme for the
Republican Party will be the challenge presented by
China]{.underline}**. It sells well with the base, and with trade
liberalization off the table for the moment (for both parties), the
question of China will likely come down **[to economic disengagement and
Beijing's threat to Taiwan.]{.underline}** A case in point is a recent
letter co-written by Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito (respectively
the Democratic and Republican senators from West Virginia) urging Biden
to include Taiwan in his newly proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.
Republican signatories to the letter included James Risch, who is likely
to be the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a new
Republican-held Senate; Roger Wicker, the likely chair of the Senate
Armed Services Committee; Marco Rubio, the likely chair of the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence; and most of the Republican members of
the current Senate Appropriations Committee. Notably, several of the
Senate's more ardent Trump supporters, including Marsha Blackburn and
Kevin Cramer, also joined the letter. (A similar House effort was also
joined by likely future national security heavyweights, including
probable House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul.) Defense
spending will be another key theme for the Republican Party. **[House
and Senate Republicans have repeatedly slammed Biden's defense spending
as inadequate to address the country's many national security challenges
and have only escalated those charges since Russia's invasion of
Ukraine.]{.underline}** McConnell has called for a 5 percent increase in
defense spending above inflation, and McCarthy has been equally
energetic. Both understand---as Trump did---that investing in the
military can be cast as a deterrent as well as a down payment on victory
in any eventual conflict. And here again, the base is with them.
**[Ditto for energy security]{.underline}**: While there is a bipartisan
constituency for pivoting away from the Middle East---and a growing
bipartisan opposition to renewing the Iran nuclear deal---Republicans
are less focused on climate change issues and more on basic pocketbook
challenges. That will mean **[more enthusiasm for restoring American
energy independence, avoiding unnecessary bickering with Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}** (still a major swing producer of oil), **[and
easing regulations on U.S. oil and gas production.]{.underline}** But
what about Ukraine and cases like it? What about those 11 in the Senate
and the 57 in the House? What about the conservative powerhouse think
tank the Heritage Foundation and its political action committee drawing
a line in the sand against the \$40 billion Ukraine aid package? Like
Heritage, Sen. Mike Braun finessed his opposition based not on the
policy of aiding Ukraine but on the cost of doing so and the spiraling
U.S. debt. Sen. Rand Paul, a perennial opponent of U.S. overseas
engagement, pinned his "no" vote on the lack of an inspector general in
the bill to oversee how the funds are spent. That's fair enough, but
it's hard to picture every one of those "no" votes switching tack if
presented with a better or cleaner bill---not when the Republican
Party's rising stars include the likes of Senate candidate J.D. Vance,
who during his campaign said, "I gotta be honest with you, I don't
really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another." **[It's
relatively easy to predict that a Republican majority will continue to
support arming and aiding Ukraine, because the vote has already
happened]{.underline}**. And though a significant minority of the
Republican caucus voted no, it was a minority. But there are harder
cases (though not just for the Republicans): the looming Chinese threat
to Taiwan, for one.

Election Outlook

**[The probability of a GOP sweep has increased but the competitiveness
of some elections in November will depend upon the]{.underline}**
identity of each party's **[nominees.]{.underline}** Procedural rules in
the Senate prevent narrow majorities from exercising broad discretion
over legislation without the consent of the minority. There are two
exceptions: judicial appointments and budget reconciliation.

**[Policy Implications]{.underline}**

Taxes: No substantive changes to tax law but **[the R&D tax credit will
be addressed if it is not already addressed in 2022]{.underline}**.
Companies now have to amortize R&D expenses over 5 years instead of the
year it was made.² **[Defense: Spending increases]{.underline}** more
**[significantly]{.underline}** under this scenario. Bipartisan
consensus on **[an adversarial posture toward China]{.underline}**
persists. **[The R&D tax credit is an important issue for]{.underline}**
the **[defense]{.underline}** industry under all three scenarios.
**[Agriculture]{.underline}**: Enacted by Congress roughly once every
five years. A new **[bill will pass but GOP may demand cuts to
s]{.underline}**upplemental **[n]{.underline}**utrition
**[a]{.underline}**ssistance **[p]{.underline}**rograms. Climate:
Nothing substantive passes. **[Debt Limit]{.underline}**: Contentious
**[negotiations before default]{.underline}** deadline. Limit is raised
but **[GOP demands concession on social spending.]{.underline}**

(Thomas P.M., The New Rules: Leadership Fatigue Puts U.S., and
Globalization, at Crossroads,
[www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/8099/the-new-rules-leadership-fatigue-puts-u-s-and-globalization-at-crossroads](http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/8099/the-new-rules-leadership-fatigue-puts-u-s-and-globalization-at-crossroads))

**[Events in Libya are a further reminder for Americans]{.underline}**
that we [**stand at a crossroads** **in our continuing evolution as
the** **world\'s sole full-service superpower**]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, we are increasingly seeking change without cost, and
shirking from risk because we are tired of the responsibility. We don\'t
know who we are anymore, and our president is a big part of that
problem. Instead of leading us, he explains to us. Barack Obama would
have us believe that he is practicing strategic patience. But many
experts and ordinary citizens alike have concluded that he is actually
beset by strategic incoherence \-- in effect, a man overmatched by the
job. It is worth first examining the larger picture: [**We live in a
time of arguably** **the greatest structural change** **in the global
order yet** **endured,**]{.underline} **[with this historical moment\'s
most amazing feature being its]{.underline}** relative and absolute
**[lack of mass violence]{.underline}**. That is something to consider
when Americans contemplate military intervention in Libya, because if we
do take the step to prevent larger-scale killing by engaging in some
killing of our own, we will not be adding to some fantastically imagined
global death count stemming from the ongoing \"megalomania\" and
\"evil\" of American \"empire.\" We\'ll be engaging in the same sort of
system-administering activity that has marked our stunningly successful
stewardship of global order since World War II. Let me be more blunt:
[**As the guardian of globalization, the U.S. military has been the
greatest force for peace the world has ever known. Had America been
removed from** **the global** **dynamics** **that governed the 20th
century**]{.underline}, the **[mass murder never would have
ended]{.underline}**. Indeed, it\'s entirely conceivable [**there would
now be no identifiable human civilization left, once nuclear weapons
entered** **the killing equation**.]{.underline} But [**the world did
not keep sliding down** **that path of** **perpetual war.**]{.underline}
[**Instead,** **America stepped up and** **changed everything by
ushering in our now-perpetual great-power peace**]{.underline}. We
introduced the international liberal trade order known as globalization
and played loyal Leviathan over its spread. What resulted was the
collapse of empires, an explosion of democracy, the persistent spread of
human rights, the liberation of women, the doubling of life expectancy,
a roughly 10-fold increase in adjusted global GDP and a profound and
persistent reduction in battle deaths from state-based conflicts. That
is what American \"hubris\" actually delivered. Please remember that the
next time some TV pundit sells you the image of \"unbridled\" American
military power as the cause of global disorder instead of its cure. With
self-deprecation bordering on self-loathing, we now imagine a
post-American world that is anything but. Just watch who scatters and
who steps up as the Facebook revolutions erupt across the Arab world.
While we might imagine ourselves the status quo power, we remain the
world\'s most vigorously revisionist force. As for the sheer \"evil\"
that is our military-industrial complex, again, let\'s examine what the
world looked like before that establishment reared its ugly head. The
last great period of global structural change was the first half of the
20th century, a period that saw a death toll of about 100 million across
two world wars. That comes to an average of 2 million deaths a year in a
world of approximately 2 billion souls. Today, with far more
comprehensive worldwide reporting, researchers report an average of less
than 100,000 battle deaths annually in a world fast approaching 7
billion people. Though admittedly crude, these **[calculations suggest a
90 percent absolute drop and a 99 percent relative drop in deaths due to
war. We are]{.underline}** **[clearly headed for a world order
characterized by multipolarity, something the American-birthed system
was designed to both encourage and accommodate. But given how things
turned out the last time we collectively faced such a fluid structure,
we would do well to keep U.S. power,]{.underline}** in all of its forms,
deeply embedded in the geometry to come. To continue the historical
survey, after salvaging Western Europe from its half-century of civil
war, the U.S. emerged as the progenitor of a new, far more just form of
globalization \-- one based on actual free trade rather than
colonialism. America then successfully replicated globalization further
in East Asia over the second half of the 20th century, setting the stage
for the Pacific Century now unfolding.

#### Heg solves [arms races]{.underline}, [land grabs]{.underline}, [rogue states]{.underline}, and [great power war]{.underline} 

**Brands 18** \[Hal, Henry Kissinger Distinguished Professor at Johns
Hopkins University\'s School of Advanced International Studies and a

American Grand Strategy in the Age of Trump.\" Page 129-133\]

**[Since World War II, the United States has had a military second to
none]{.underline}**. Since the Cold War, **[America has committed to
having]{.underline}** **[overwhelming military primacy]{.underline}**.
The idea, as George W. Bush declared in 2002, that America must possess
"strengths beyond challenge" has featured in every major U.S. strategy
document for a quarter century; it has also been reflected in concrete
terms.6

From the early 1990s, for example, the **[United States consistently
accounted for around 35 to 45 percent of world defense spending and
maintained peerless global power-projection
capabilities]{.underline}**.7 Perhaps more important, U.S. **[primacy
was also unrivaled in key overseas strategic
regions]{.underline}**---**[Europe, East Asia, the Middle
East]{.underline}**. **[From thrashing Saddam]{.underline}** Hussein's
million-man Iraqi military **[during Operation Desert Storm, to
deploying---with impunity---two carrier strike groups off Taiwan during
the China-Taiwan crisis of 1995-- 96, Washington has been able to
project military power superior to anything a regional rival could
employ even on its own geopolitical doorstep.]{.underline}**

This **[military dominance]{.underline}** **[has constituted
the]{.underline}** **[hard-power backbone of an ambitious global
strategy.]{.underline}** After the Cold War, U.S. **[policymakers
committed to averting a return to the unstable multipolarity of earlier
eras, and to perpetuating the more favorable unipolar
order.]{.underline}** **[They committed to building on the successes of
the postwar era by further advancing liberal political values and an
open international economy, and to suppressing international scourges
such as rogue states, nuclear proliferation, and catastrophic
terrorism.]{.underline}** And because they recognized that military
force remained the ultima ratio regum, **[they understood
the]{.underline}** **[centrality]{.underline}** **[of military
preponderance]{.underline}**.

**[Washington would need the military power]{.underline}** **[necessary
to underwrite worldwide alliance commitments. It would have to preserve
substantial overmatch]{.underline}** **[versus any
potential]{.underline}** **[great-power rival.]{.underline}** It must be
able to answer the sharpest challenges to the international system, such
as Saddam's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 or jihadist extremism after 9/11.
Finally, **[because prevailing global norms generally reflect hard-power
realities, America would need the superiority to assure that its own
values remained ascendant. It was impolitic to say that U.S. strategy
and the international order required "strengths beyond challenge," but
it was not at all inaccurate.]{.underline}**

American primacy, moreover, was eminently affordable. At the height of
the Cold War, the United States spent over 12 percent of GDP on defense.
Since the mid-1990s, the number has usually been between 3 and
4 percent.8 In a historically favorable international environment,
Washington could enjoy primacy---and its geopolitical fruits---on the
cheap.

Yet U.S. strategy also heeded, at least until recently, **[the fact that
there was a limit to how cheaply that primacy could be had. The American
military did shrink significantly during the 1990s, but U.S. officials
understood that if Washington cut back too far, its primacy would erode
to a point where it ceased to deliver its geopolitical
benefits]{.underline}**. **[Alliances]{.underline}**
**[would]{.underline}** **[lose credibility]{.underline}**;
**[the]{.underline}** **[stability of key regions would be
eroded]{.underline}**; **[rivals would be emboldened]{.underline}**;
**[international crises would go unaddressed]{.underline}**. American
**[primacy was thus like a reasonably priced insurance
policy]{.underline}**. **[It required nontrivial expenditures, but
protected against far costlier outcomes.]{.underline}**9 Washington paid
its insurance premiums for two decades after the Cold War. But more
**[recently American primacy and strategic solvency have been
imperiled.]{.underline}**

THE DARKENING HORIZON For most of the post--Cold War era, the
international system was--- by historical standards---remarkably benign.
Dangers existed, and as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,
demonstrated, they could manifest with horrific effect. But for **[two
decades after the Soviet collapse, the world was characterized by
remarkably low levels of great-power competition, high levels of
security in key theaters such as Europe and East Asia, and the
comparative weakness of those "rogue" actors---Iran, Iraq, North Korea,
al-Qaeda---who most aggressively challenged American
power.]{.underline}** During the 1990s, some observers even spoke of a
"strategic pause," the idea being that the end of the Cold War had
afforded the United States a respite from normal levels of geopolitical
danger and competition. Now, however, **[the strategic horizon is
darkening]{.underline}**, due to four factors.

First, **[great-power military competition is back]{.underline}**.
**[The world's two leading authoritarian
powers]{.underline}**---**[China]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[Russia]{.underline}**---**[are seeking regional
hegemony]{.underline}**, **[contesting global norms such as
nonaggression and freedom of navigation, and developing the military
punch to underwrite these ambitions]{.underline}**. Notwithstanding
severe economic and demographic problems**[, Russia has conducted a
major military modernization emphasizing nuclear weapons, high-end
conventional capabilities, and rapid-deployment and special operations
forces--- and utilized many of these capabilities in conflicts in
Ukraine and Syria]{.underline}**.10 **[China]{.underline}**, meanwhile,
**[has carried out a buildup of historic proportions,]{.underline}**
with constant-dollar defense outlays rising from US\$26 billion in 1995
to US\$226 billion in 2016.11 Ominously, **[these expenditures have
funded development of power-projection and antiaccess/area
denial]{.underline}** (**[A2/AD) tools]{.underline}** **[necessary to
threaten China's neighbors and complicate U.S. intervention on their
behalf]{.underline}**. Washington has grown accustomed to having a
generational military lead; **[Russian and Chinese modernization efforts
are now creating a far more competitive environment.]{.underline}**

Second, the **[international outlaws are no longer so
weak.]{.underline}** **[North Korea's]{.underline}** **[conventional
forces have atrophied, but it has amassed a growing nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}** **[and is developing an intercontinental delivery
capability that will soon allow it to threaten not just America's
regional allies but also the continental United States]{.underline}**.12
**[Iran]{.underline}** **[remains a]{.underline}** **[nuclear threshold
state,]{.underline}** one **[that continues to develop ballistic
missiles and A2/AD capabilities while employing sectarian and proxy
forces across the Middle East]{.underline}**. **[The Islamic
State]{.underline}**, for its part, **[is headed for defeat, but has
displayed]{.underline}** **[military capabilities
unprecedented]{.underline}** **[for any terrorist group,]{.underline}**
**[and shown that]{.underline}** **[counterterrorism]{.underline}**
**[will continue to place significant operational demands on U.S. forces
whether in this context or in others.]{.underline}** Rogue actors have
long preoccupied American planners, but **[the rogues are now more
capable than at any time in decades.]{.underline}**

Third, **[the]{.underline}** **[democratization of
technology]{.underline}** **[has allowed more actors to contest American
superiority in dangerous ways]{.underline}**. The spread of
**[antisatellite]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[cyberwarfare]{.underline}** **[capabilities]{.underline}**; **[the
proliferation of man-portable air defense systems and ballistic
missiles; the increasing availability of key elements of the
precision-strike complex--- these phenomena have had a military leveling
effect by giving weaker actors capabilities which were formerly unique
to technologically advanced states]{.underline}**. **[As such
technologies]{.underline}** "**[proliferate worldwide]{.underline}**,"
Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein commented in 2016,
"**[the]{.underline}** **[technology]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[capability gaps]{.underline}** **[between
America and our adversaries are closing dangerously
fast]{.underline}**."13 Indeed, as these capabilities spread,
**[fourth-generation systems]{.underline}** (such as F-15s and F-16s)
**[may provide decreasing utility]{.underline}** **[against even
non-great-power competitors]{.underline}**, **[and far more
fifth-generation capabilities may be needed to perpetuate American
overmatch]{.underline}**.

Finally, **[the number of challenges has multiplied]{.underline}**.
**[During the 1990s and early 2000s, Washington faced rogue states and
jihadist extremism---but not intense great-power rivalry]{.underline}**.
America faced conflicts in the Middle East---but East Asia and Europe
were comparatively secure. Now, **[the old threats still exist---but the
more permissive conditions have vanished]{.underline}**. **[The United
States confronts rogue states, lethal jihadist organizations, and
great-power competition; there are severe challenges in all three
Eurasian theaters. "I don't recall a time when we have been confronted
with a more diverse array of threats, whether it's the nation state
threats posed by Russia]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[China]{.underline}** **[and particularly their substantial nuclear
capabilities, or non-nation states of the likes of ISIL, Al Qaida,
etc]{.underline}**.," Director of National Intelligence James Clapper
commented in 2016. **[Trends in the strategic landscape constituted a
veritable "litany of doom]{.underline}**."14 The **[United States thus
faces not just more significant, but also more numerous, challenges to
its military dominance than it has for at least a quarter
century.]{.underline}**

### Econ 

#### History shows Republican midterms victory will solve economy.

Today, **[Republican leaders should explicitly remind Americans of this
history, and point out to voters that they have a similar opportunity
before them]{.underline}**. Just as George H.W. Bush handed his
predecessor an economy that was rapidly recovering from recession only
to have it wrecked by a Democrat president tacking left, Donald Trump
gave Biden the strongest economic recovery in history. As we know, Biden
proceeded to quickly squander it. Just as in 1994, however, the
**[election of large Republican majorities in the House and Senate would
produce an immediate change in the national morale and economic culture.
Biden's weak economy would begin turning around the day after the
election. The results would be seen instantly. Coupled with a
legislative agenda of strong pro-growth policies, a Republican Congress
could go a long way toward saving the U.S. economy, creating jobs, and
producing a rapid return to prosperity.]{.underline}** And who
knows---perhaps Biden would even have the sense to take a page out of
Bill Clinton's book, and race back to the political center to save his
presidency, and the economy along with it.

accessed on 11/16/2020, JMP)

World War II

**[The events leading to war in 1939 included]{.underline}** a sharp
division between the wealthy and everyone else, **[economic
catastrophe]{.underline}** **[in the Great Depression]{.underline}**,
sharp reductions in global trade, a breakdown in international
cooperation, and the end of liberal governance in much of the world.
Once again, these variables are present.

**[Even before]{.underline}** the **[Covid]{.underline}**-19 pandemic,
**[trade was decreasing]{.underline}** and beggar-thy-neighbor economic
policies had become the norm. It might be tempting to place this blame
on Trump, but he was elected by people in his country who have suffered
40 years of criminal economic competition from China. It is no wonder
they elected Trump and it is no wonder he undermined a global trade
system that has failed America's working class.

Similarly, **[evidence of the breakdown of international cooperation and
liberalism are everywhere]{.underline}**. The world is unable to deal
with the existential threat of climate change. Authoritarian regimes
have seats on the UN Human Rights Council. There is a great and
increasing gap between the wealthy and everyone else, a new Gilded Age.
Liberalism, unable to cope, is in retreat everywhere, from the US and
the UK to fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe and Latin America. Our
world is gravely ill.

Pandemic

**[Into this morass we stir a global pandemic]{.underline}**, with its
origin in a corrupt, authoritarian state that is hostile to openness,
human dignity and truth. That China denied and then exported the
pandemic was as predictable as it is lamentable. **[The pandemic will
bring a global economic depression, the only variable from World War II
not present today.]{.underline}** We should expect more governments to
fall, **[we should expect liberalism to retreat further]{.underline}**,
and we should expect increased nationalism and violence upon our own
species. In short, we are in for dark days.

**[Dictators attempt to divert the attention of their
people]{.underline}** from corruption and injustice **[by seeking
external enemies. Wars will]{.underline}** therefore
**[increase]{.underline}**, and **[status quo powers such as
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[may attempt to defend a crumbling system]{.underline}**. **[The
chance of war between China and the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[has increased
dramatically because almost all of the structural variables today point
toward war]{.underline}**.

Both **[World War I and II]{.underline}** were avoidable because
different variables were present. Consequently, had skilled leadership
been present, each war might have been avoided by correctly diagnosing
the causes of the impending crises. That the wars were not avoided does
not mean they could not have been; it simply means leadership was not up
to the task.

But today the **[causes]{.underline}** of both of those wars **[have
been combined in a single cauldron]{.underline}**. So it is reasonable
to ask, **[even with good leadership]{.underline}** (of which there is
no doubt we are lacking), **[can great-power war be
avoided?]{.underline}**

The conclusions reached in this thesis demonstrate how **[economic
considerations]{.underline}** **[within states]{.underline}** can
**[figure prominently into the calculus for future
conflicts]{.underline}**. The findings also suggest that **[security
issues with economic]{.underline}** or financial **[underpinnings will
transcend classical determinants of]{.underline}** war and
**[conflict]{.underline}**, **[and change the manner by which rival
states engage in hostile acts toward one another]{.underline}**. The
research shows that **[security concerns emanating from economic
uncertainty]{.underline}** and the inherent vulnerabilities within
global financial markets **[will present new challenges for national
security]{.underline}**, **[and provide developing states new asymmetric
options for balancing against stronger states]{.underline}**.
**[The]{.underline}** security **[areas]{.underline}**, identified in
the proceeding chapters, **[are likely to mature into global security
threats]{.underline}** in the immediate future. As the case study on
South Korea suggest, **[the overlapping security issues]{.underline}**
**[associated with economic decline and reduced military spending by the
United States will affect allied confidence in America's security
guarantees]{.underline}**. The study shows that **[this]{.underline}**
outcome **[could cause regional instability or realignments of strategic
partnerships in the Asia-pacific region with ramifications for U.S.
national security.]{.underline}** **[Rival states and non-state
groups]{.underline}** may also **[become emboldened to challenge
America]{.underline}**'s status in the unipolar international system.
**[The]{.underline}** potential **[risks associated with stolen or loose
WMD]{.underline}**, resulting from poor security, can **[also pose a
threat to U.S. national security]{.underline}**. The case study on
Pakistan, Syria and North Korea show how **[financial constraints affect
weapons security making weapons vulnerable to theft]{.underline}**, and
how **[financial factors]{.underline}** can **[influence WMD
prolif]{.underline}**eration **[by contributing to the motivating
factors behind a trusted insider's decision to sell weapons
technology]{.underline}**. The inherent vulnerabilities within the
global financial markets will provide terrorists' organizations and
other non-state groups, who object to the current international system
or distribution of power, with opportunities to disrupt global finance
and perhaps weaken America's status. A more ominous threat originates
from states intent on increasing diversification of foreign currency
holdings, establishing alternatives to the dollar for international
trade, or engaging financial warfare against the United States.

### A2 Warming

#### No impact to warming -- its overestimated, slow, and adaptation solves

**Ridley 15** (Matt, fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and of
the Academy of Medical Sciences, and a foreign honorary member of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences, member of Science and Technology
select committee in the House of Lords, worked for the Economist for 9
years as a Science Editor, "Why climate policies are doing more harm
than climate change"
http://www.rationaloptimist.com/blog/paris-climate-conference/)

This year looks likely to be a lot warmer than last, though still not as
warm in both standard satellite data sets as 1998, the last time that a
strong El Nino in the Pacific Ocean boosted the global air temperature a
lot (surface thermometers sets say it will be warmer than 1998, once
adjusted in various ways). **[The average trend over the past 35 years
is 0.1 degrees of warming per decade according to the satellite data,
less]{.underline}** **[than 0.2 per decade according to the surface
thermometers. Neither trend is fast enough to produce significantly
dangerous climate change even by the latter part of this
century.]{.underline}** The **[warming has been much slower than was
predicted]{.underline}** when the scare began. Nor is it evenly spread.
The Antarctic continent has warmed hardly at all, and the entire
southern hemisphere has warmed about half as fast as the northern. The
Arctic has warmed more than the tropics, night has warmed more than day
and winter has warmed more than summer. Cities have warmed faster than
the countryside, but that's because of local warming factors, not global
ones: buildings, vehicles, industry, pavements and people trap warmth.
**[How unusual is today's temperature?]{.underline}** As I did this
weekend, you have no doubt had conversations along the following lines
recently: "Hasn't it been mild? End of November and we've hardly had a
frost yet!" All true. But then be honest: can you not recall such
conversations throughout your life? I can. And here's what the Met
Office had to say about November 1938, long before I was born: "The
weather of the month was distinguished by exceptional mildness: at
numerous places it was the mildest November on record." In 1953,
November was even milder and there was no air frost recorded in Oxford
in the last four months of the year at all. I am not saying it has not
generally become warmer, but that the variation dwarfs the trend.
**[Let's go back]{.underline}** a little further, **[to the Middle
Ages]{.underline}**. It used to be argued by some that **[the "Medieval
Warm Period" of about a thousand years ago, when mountain glaciers
retreated, vines grew further north and Iceland was widely
cultivated]{.underline}**, was confined to Europe. We now know from
multiple sources of evidence that it **[was global]{.underline}**.
**[Tree lines were higher than today]{.underline}** in many mountain
ranges, for example. Both North Pacific and Antarctic Ocean **[water
temperatures were 0.65C warmer than today]{.underline}**. **[Go back yet
further]{.underline}**, still within the current interglacial period,
**[to the]{.underline}** so-called **[Holocene Optimum of 6,000-9,000
years ago. Ocean]{.underline}** **[temperatures were]{.underline}** up
to **[two degrees warmer than today, the Arctic]{.underline}** Ocean
**[was]{.underline}** nearly or **[completely ice-free]{.underline}** at
the end of summer in many years, and the boreal forest in Siberia
extended 150 miles further north than today. July **[temperatures were
up to six degrees warmer than today]{.underline}** in the Siberian
Arctic. **[Was this Holocene Optimum a horrible time of droughts,
storms, disease and famine?]{.underline}** **[Not especially. It was the
period when agriculture spread rapidly across the globe
from]{.underline}** five or seven centres of
**[invention]{.underline}**. **[Abundant rainfall in Africa led to
lakes]{.underline}** in the Sahara **[with crocodiles and hippos in
them, surrounded by green vegetation]{.underline}** in the monsoon
season. **[Today's gentle warming, progressing]{.underline}** much more

#### Republicans will solve climate change and inflation problems with energy legislation. 

**Josh Siegel '22** (Josh Siegel was a reporter at the Washington
Examiner he's been the lead author of Daily on Energy, "House
Republicans to introduce climate change strategy with eye on midterms,"
Politico,

House Republicans are preparing to release a six-part strategy to try to
tame surging gasoline prices and to combat climate change that calls for
increasing production of all types of energy and sets no greenhouse gas
targets. The plan to be released Thursday is the product of an "energy,
climate, and conservation task force" created by top House Republican
Kevin McCarthy last year that he tasked with devising a policy agenda to
address climate change [**should Republicans capture the** House in the
2022 **midterm elections**]{.underline}. "We are
**[creat]{.underline}i**ng [a clear coherent **energy strategy** that
returns the U.S. to an **emissions reduction trajectory** as opposed to
what we are seeing under the Biden administration, which is failing
every test, whether it be affordability, emissions or
security,"]{.underline} Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.), the chair of the
17-member task force, told POLITICO in an exclusive interview previewing
the plan. The strategy released by House Republicans contains few new
policy ideas and is meant instead to provide a high-level overview of
how [the party would **address** the challenges of **record-high energy
prices worsened by Russia's war in Ukraine while reducing global
emissions**]{.underline}. The strategy is consistent with McCarthy's
effort in recent years to develop the party's climate change platform
and messaging to challenge Democrats and the Biden administration, with
an eye toward winning support from young people and suburban voters who
polls show are increasingly concerned worried about the issue. The GOP
is betting that promoting private sector innovation to curb emissions
without targeting fossil fuels that are the biggest source of greenhouse
gases will enable the party to win competitive oil and gas producing
House districts won by Democrats in 2020. The task force report, shared
with POLITICO, contains six pillars: "[Unlock America's Resources,"
"Beat China and Russia," "Let America Build," "Build Resilient
Communities," "American Innovation" and "Conservation with a
Purpose."]{.underline} Without those themes, Republicans aim to pursue
the party's well-trodden policy ideas such as promoting domestic
production and export of "all of the above" energy resources,
[**including oil and gas, along with zero-carbon technologies such as
wind, solar, small modular nuclear reactors, hydrogen and carbon
capture**.]{.underline} They also want to streamline permitting to
reduce obstacles to [**building clean energy** and traditional energy
infrastructure, including pipelines, LNG terminals and mines to produce
critical minerals.]{.underline} House Republicans say they plan to
[introduce new legislation]{.underline} next Congress that corresponds
to each of the six policy areas should the GOP take control of the
chamber. The report, however, is also notable in what it does not
include. House Republicans continue to resist setting a specific
emissions reduction target. They oppose policies to reduce fossil fuel
use, including regulations, taxes, or mandates. And Graves said House
Republicans, unlike at least some GOP counterparts in the Senate, are
skeptical of the government extending and expanding clean energy tax
credits that the renewable industry says are critical to helping them
deploy zero-carbon power at the scale needed to address climate change.
"Are we open to looking at strategies that nudge technologies to
economic sustainability? Yes. But a lot of that can be achieved through
R&D partnering with innovators," said Graves, who represents an oil and
gas district experiencing sea level rise and is currently the ranking
GOP member of the Democratic-led Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.
In leaning too much into fossil fuels to counter Biden's more aggressive
climate agenda, Republicans risk turning off swing voters in states and
districts already feeling the effects of climate change, with forecasts
predicting a brutal summer for wildfires, extreme heat and drought.

### Win for Biden -- Russia 

#### GOP midterm strategy relies on hammering Biden on Russia, foreign policy. The aff changes the narrative.

**[After getting his way on a \$40 billion Ukraine aid bill, Senate
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell]{.underline}** (R-KY) took a victory lap
in the form of a fawning New York Times interview. The Kentucky senator
had to be particularly pleased with the headline on the piece that read,
\"On Ukraine, McConnell Tries to Show the World This Isn\'t Trump\'s
GOP.\" The same day, Politico chimed in with a similar article that took
its readers \"Inside McConnell\'s bid to quash GOP \'isolationists.\'\"
Both made the point that although former President Donald Trump had been
critical of the massive package, only 11 out of the 50 Republicans in
the Senate had followed his lead on the issue. That dissent, as well as
the efforts of GOP dissidents like Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) to slow down
the Biden administration\'s rush to pass the bill, was enough for Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), whose caucus was unanimous in its
support, to slam Republicans for being \"soft on Putin.\" But McConnell,
who had helped orchestrate the victory with a quick trip to Ukraine the
previous weekend, was still satisfied, claiming that the vote
represented a reaffirmation of his party\'s traditional support for the
U.S.-Europe alliance over the views of a group he dismissed as
\"isolationists.\" With most of his caucus sticking with him over the
complaints of Trump and many of the former president\'s supporters,
McConnell had cause to celebrate. And he can also point to a Pew
**[Research]{.underline}** Center poll that not only **[shows most
Americans support aid to Ukraine,]{.underline}** but also that a
**[plurality]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}**
**[conservatives]{.underline}** actually **[think President Joe Biden
hasn\'t done enough to help resist the Russian invasion.]{.underline}**
One of the main **[GOP criticisms of Biden is that his weakness in
Afghanistan and elsewhere encouraged Russia\'s
aggression]{.underline}**. Though **[Trump\'s]{.underline}** rhetoric
about NATO and foreign entanglements in general sounded isolationist at
times, in practice, it was anything but, as his **[efforts strengthened
the alliance]{.underline}** **[while taking aggressive stands against
ISIS and Iran]{.underline}**. NEWSWEEK NEWSLETTER SIGN-UP \> Moreover,
even though many on the Right see the obsession with Russia as a
distraction from the more dangerous threat from Communist China, Sen.
**[Ted Cruz]{.underline}** (R-TX) **[backed McConnell on the aid package
because of a belief that it would help deter Beijing from a possible
invasion of Taiwan.]{.underline}** From that perspective, though the
\$40 billion is more than the United States sends to any ally---Israel
is routinely bashed for receiving \$3.8 billion in annual military
assistance even though almost all of it is subsequently spent back in
the United States---it would be money well spent if it helped degrade
the Russian military and sent a deterrent message to China. In that
sense, McConnell is channeling Sen. Arthur Vandenberg (R-MI), who
chaired the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in the late 1940s and
supported President Harry Truman\'s Cold War policies in Europe.
Vandenberg\'s bipartisan cooperation with Democrats was summed up by his
famous quip about \"politics stopping at the water\'s edge.\" Given that
he can take credit for the likely impending overturning of Roe v. Wade
by conservative Supreme Court justices whose confirmations were largely
his doing, McConnell can be forgiven for thinking that despite his low
polling numbers, his party\'s base should acknowledge his achievements.

OFFERS \> Still, a willingness to play ball with the Democrats on
Ukraine isn\'t likely to endear McConnell to voters who love Trump.
Those voters do so primarily because he understands that in the current
atmosphere of total culture war in which the Left demonizes all
conservatives, bipartisanship only helps foes who would never return the
favor. The Left likes the idea of anyone putting Trump in his place. And
in a less partisan era than the one he is now living in, McConnell
playing Vandenberg to Biden\'s Truman might have won him points even
within his own party. But **[in 2022, McConnell is still the enemy in
the eyes of the mainstream media]{.underline}**, and skepticism about
the puzzling way in which much of the Washington establishment from both
parties has decided the territorial integrity of Ukraine is the main
objective of American foreign policy is likely to only grow among
conservatives. Anyone who has been listening to the rhetoric on the
campaign trail in contested Republican primaries around the country
knows that it\'s Trump\'s skepticism about Ukraine, rather than
McConnell\'s internationalism, that is motivating GOP voters to turn out
this year. The **[imagery of Republicans supporting such a large amount
being sent abroad at a time of domestic woes]{.underline}** such as
inflation, supply chain shortages such as that affecting baby formula
and a crisis at the southern border that has created a flood of illegal
immigrants heading into the country, **[goes against the GOP\'s midterm
strategy of holding Biden accountable for the deplorable state of the
country. McConnell\'s willingness to agree with Biden about rushing aid
to Ukraine because of the urgency of its wartime needs may eventually
come back to bite him if a GOP Congress elected this fall pursues
oversight for the spending]{.underline}**. Indeed, the lack of
transparency in the aid bill is a real problem. Despite Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky being given the Churchill treatment by the
international press, his government is well known for corruption. If
much of what is being sent to Kyiv winds up in the pockets of friendly
oligarchs or officials, McConnell may regret choosing not to insist on
accountability for the aid process while buying into Biden\'s talking
points about saving democracy in Eastern Europe. McConnell\'s boasts are
not in sync with the message most Republican primary voters are sending.
The GOP Senate caucus that convenes next January is likely to have
several more Ukraine skeptics, such as J.D. Vance in Ohio. That will be
even truer for what is likely to be a new Republican majority in the
House. The emergence of Trump and others who buck the foreign policy
establishment\'s conventional wisdom on a number of issues should have
already made it clear to McConnell and his Senate cronies that their
period of dominance of the party is nearing an end. Should he work with
Biden to try to pass a similar Ukraine aid package next year, McConnell
is probably setting himself up for defeat.

#### Biden wants midterms to be focused on foreign policy not the economy

**Lauter '22** (David Lauter, Senior Editor at the Los Angeles Times
covering Politics; "Essential Politics: War in Ukraine scrambles GOP and
Democratic strategies for midterms"; Los Angeles Times; 3.11.22;

"**[As a general rule, Americans don't vote on foreign policy unless
American men and women are dying in a war, but]{.underline}** we've
rarely had an international event not involving the United States
directly that has so totally consumed our news and attention as the
Russian invasion of Ukraine," said Republican pollster and strategist
Whit Ayres. "This war has become symbolic for the survival of democratic
regimes against authoritarian dictatorships," Ayres added. "That
symbolism has given it a much broader meaning." A poll this week by
Navigator Research, a Democratic firm, found that 37% of American voters
said they were "very closely" following news from Ukraine, and nearly 8
in 10 said they were following it at least somewhat closely --- high
numbers for a foreign issue. **[National security and foreign
policy]{.underline}** had **[jumped to the top of American
concerns]{.underline}**, tied with jobs and the economy, displacing
worries about the coronavirus and inflation, the poll found. The summer
months may seem like the time to take a break from worrying about your
teenager's mental health. Surely the promise of sunshine and no homework
will lead to improved mood and behavior, right? Amid that intense focus,
Americans have clearly picked a side --- overwhelmingly favoring the
Ukrainians. That could be seen in Wednesday's House vote to suspend oil
imports from Russia, which passed 414-17 with just two of the chamber's
most left-wing Democrats, Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri and Ilhan Omar of
Minnesota, and 15 right-wing Republicans voting no. That level of
attention makes the Ukraine war the kind of event that could
significantly shift U.S. politics. "Politics isn't the most important
thing right now," said Democratic strategist Steve Schale, chief
executive of the pro-Biden super-pac Unite the Country. But, he added,
since 1992, "the only two midterm elections that were not absolute
debacles for the incumbent president's party were held during a window
where there was something significant in the country that reshaped the
conversation." Those two were 1998, when voters rejected Republican
efforts to impeach President Clinton and Democrats gained four seats,
and 2002, when Republicans under President George W. Bush gained seats
in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Biden and the
Democrats have a long way to go to emulate the midterm successes those
two presidents enjoyed. A new Wall Street Journal **[poll]{.underline}**
relea**[s]{.underline}**ed Friday **[continue]{.underline}**s **[to show
Democrats trailing the GOP]{.underline}** as the party voters say they
expect to back in November. **[But polls have]{.underline}** also
**[shown]{.underline}** **[an uptick in voters' assessments of how Biden
is doing his job]{.underline}**. The change is just a few percentage
points, but after nine months of nearly steady decline, it's **[a

has clearly contributed to the boost in Biden's ratings. A poll by
Morning Consult for Politico found this week, for example, that **[by
46% to 42%, voters approved of Biden's response to the
crisis.]{.underline}** Voters' assessments of how Biden has dealt with
Ukraine have improved notably since last month and are also
significantly higher than how they assess his presidency overall.

WASHINGTON ― **[Nearly two dozen Republican lawmakers are calling on
President Joe Biden to engage with allies on emerging
technologies]{.underline}** like 5G networking and artificial
intelligence **[in the face of China's advancements.]{.underline}**
House Armed Services Committee ranking member Mike Rogers, House Foreign
Affairs Committee ranking member Mike McCaul, and House Science, Space
and Technology Committee ranking member Frank Lucas signed a letter to
Biden urging him to maximize alliances to counter "China's vision for
tech authoritarianism and protect our own economic and national security
interests." The message to Biden signals an avenue for bipartisan
cooperation, just days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken appeared
supportive of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's efforts to forge a
D-10 group of democracies ― South Korea, India and Australia, plus the
G-7 nations ― to cooperate on 5G and vulnerable supply chains. In his
confirmation hearing last week, Blinken said: "Bringing concerned
countries together, the digital democracies together in an appropriate
forum, is the place to start." "I don't want to minimize the challenge.
We obviously have disagreements among democracies about a lot of
profound questions about how technology is used, so we've got some work
to do just to get our own collective house in order," he said. Western
allies, under pressure from President Donald Trump, agreed to exclude
Chinese tech giant Huawei from their 5G networks, claiming an espionage
risk, something the company has denied. Since then, the European Union
signed a long-promised investment deal with China last month despite the
public concerns from the incoming Biden administration. The
**[Republican lawmakers]{.underline}**, referencing Johnson in their
letter, **[recommended raising the issue of China's tech
authoritarianism through the G-7 and NATO]{.underline}** ― but also
expanding engagements with allied democracies, and creating and hosting
new international groups dedicated to democratic cooperation on
technology. They also called for the development of an allied network to
encourage cooperation among companies in allied states to scale emerging
technologies, and for the U.S. to help allies establish governmental
bodies like the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to
review foreign investments and prevent the transfer of allied
technologies. McCaul, who chaired the House's Republican-only China Task
Force, **[called on Biden to prioritize investments in domestic
manufacturing of next-generation semiconductor chips in his expected
infrastructure plan. McCaul has sponsored legislation to boost funding
for basic research.]{.underline}** "We must work with our allies to
ensure that our supply chain is secure and the future of technology is
safely out of the hands of the \[Chinese Communist Party\]," McCaul said
in a statement. Democratic lawmakers have also raised alarms over
China's development of emerging technologies. After a report last month
that Huawei tested AI software that could recognize Uighur minorities
and alert police, Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, the incoming Senate
Foreign Relations Committee chairman, tweeted the following: "A shocking
reminder that #China continues to flout the ethical development of
emerging technologies. The US must lead an effort with our allies to
ensure the proper use of the digital domain predicated on the values of
openness, stability, security, & protection of human rights."

### NATO

#### Commitment to NATO motivates Democrats while dividing GOP voters

**Saleton 3/21/22** Writer, The Bulwark Washington, Washington, D.C.
U.S. As seen in: The Bulwark, The New York Times, Business Insider, MSN,
The Wall Street Journal, New Scientist, Slate, National Post, The Dallas
Morning News, Mother Jones, Slate France and more, "Republican Voters
Are Now America's Foreign Policy Doves," The Bulwark, March 21, 2022,
https://www.thebulwark.com/republican-voters-are-now-americas-foreign-policy-doves/

On Wednesday, 15 Republican senators held a press conference to
criticize President Biden for insufficient boldness in Ukraine. John
Kennedy likened the president to "Bambi's baby brother." Ben Sasse
accused the administration of treating the war like a "nerd-lawyer"
dispute, not "a moral battle." John Cornyn sternly declared, "The Biden
administration's timidity in the face of this evil needs to end." From
Richard Nixon in 1968 to Mitt Romney in 2012, this is how Republican
politicians talked about foreign policy: They were the party of
strength, and Democrats were the party of weakness. But that formulation
is no longer true. The GOP, as measured by the expressed beliefs of its
voters, has become the more dovish party. The Supreme Court reoriented
our understanding of fundamental rights today. Now come the fights
over... For more than a century, Republicans have had an isolationist
wing. The power of that faction has waxed and waned. But in the Trump
era, for the first time since before World War II, it has taken over the
party. In an Echelon Insights poll taken from February 19 to 23, as
Russian troops surrounded and prepared to invade Ukraine, most
Democratic voters affirmed that "It's best for the future of our country
to be active in world affairs." [**Republicans**, by a ratio of 2 to
1]{.underline}, chose the alternative [**answer: "We should pay less
attention to problems overseas and concentrate on problems here at
home**.]{.underline}" In the same poll, **[47 percent of Democrats said
human rights should be a top priority in foreign policy. Only 27 percent
of Republicans agreed]{.underline}**. Republicans aren't just less
interested than Democrats in fighting for universal values, such as
democracy. They're also less likely to support allies. In the Echelon
Insights poll, Republicans were less willing than Democrats to "provide
military support to defend allies' security" or to "participate in and
provide resources to international military alliances like NATO." In an
Economist/YouGov survey taken in early February, [**27 percent of
Republicans---compared to only 8 percent of Democrats---said the United
States should withdraw from NATO**.]{.underline} A month later---more
than a week into the Russian invasion, as NATO countries rallied to help
Ukraine---34 percent of Democrats expressed a very favorable view of
NATO. Only 12 percent of Republicans agreed. This rising isolationism on
the right has converged with Trumpist sympathy for Russia and hostility
to Ukraine. When former Vice President Mike Pence said there was "no
room in this party for apologists for Putin," he was talking---whether
he knew it or not---about a faction that does, in fact, take up
significant space in the GOP. Even during the invasion, Putin's
favorable rating among Republicans has reached 14 percent, 15 percent,
and 18 percent in some surveys---more than twice as high as his
favorable rating among Democrats. Republicans are more likely than
Democrats to affirm that Putin is a "genius," that his conduct of the
war is justified, and that the best outcome would be a Russian victory.
On average, only about 10 percent of Republicans openly express such
pro-invasion views. But they're joined by a much larger group of
Republicans who are hostile to or wary of Ukraine. This is the result,
in large part, of Trumpist propaganda that for years has accused Ukraine
of pervasive corruption and electoral sabotage against the GOP. In the
latest Economist/YouGov survey, taken from March 12 to 15, 40 percent of
Democrats classified Ukraine as an ally. Only 23 percent of Republicans
agreed. Fifty-three percent of Democrats expressed a very favorable view
of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky; only 39 percent of
Republicans shared that view. [Republicans were also significantly less
likely than Democrats to acknowledge that Ukraine is a
democracy.]{.underline} In other polls, Democrats have consistently said
that Ukraine deserves little or no blame for the war. Republicans are
closely divided on that question. In February, **[these
sentiments---isolationist, pro-Putin, anti-Ukraine---combined to divide
the GOP over whether it was more important to "take a strong stand so
that Russia does not take over Ukraine by force" or, alternatively, to
"maintain good relations with Russia."]{.underline}** In a February
Yahoo News/YouGov survey, 58 percent of Democrats said the United States
should take Ukraine's side, but only 42 percent of Republicans agreed.
Most Democrats said it was "in America's best interests to stop Russia
and help Ukraine," but Republicans leaned toward the alternative answer:
"The conflict is none of America's business." Today, Republican
politicians say Biden should have sanctioned Russia and sent more
weapons to Ukraine before the invasion. But that wasn't what Republican
voters thought. In the Yahoo News poll, only 40 percent of Republicans
supported sanctions against Russia, even after they were told that "more
than 100,000 Russian troops are massing on the border of Ukraine,
threatening an invasion." In weekly Economist/YouGov surveys, Democrats
clearly favored weapons shipments to Ukraine, but Republicans were
evenly divided. A Washington Post/ABC News poll found that if sanctions
on Russia entailed higher energy prices in the United States, 62 percent
of Democrats would still support them, but only 44 percent of
Republicans would go along. Many Republicans preferred appeasement. In
early February, when an Economist/YouGov survey asked about Sen. Josh
Hawley's proposal "to stop supporting Ukraine's prospective membership
in NATO," more Republicans supported that idea than opposed it. Most
Democrats, however, said the United States should continue to support
NATO membership for Ukraine. As Biden moved to fortify Europe against
the Russian threat, Republicans opposed him. In mid-February, a
Quinnipiac survey informed respondents that Biden had "approved the
deployment of thousands of troops to Eastern Europe to support U.S.
allies in NATO, such as Poland and Romania." Seventy percent of
Democrats endorsed the deployment. But a plurality of Republicans, 47
percent to 43 percent, rejected it. The Republican resistance wasn't
just about Biden. A Suffolk poll, also taken in mid-February, found that
**[Republicans were significantly less likely than Democrats to support
every kind of intervention]{.underline}**: sanctions, military aid,
troops to the region, and troops to Ukraine. Twenty-two percent of
Republicans, compared to 9 percent of Democrats, said the U.S. should do
nothing. Echelon Insights found a stark partisan divide when it asked
voters to choose between interventionist and isolationist statements.
Most Democrats, 56 percent to 31 percent, chose this statement: "The
United States has a moral responsibility to protect Ukraine and other
democratic allies from aggression and invasion, even if it means sending
military aid or deploying troops." But most Republicans, 51 percent to
39 percent, chose the alternative statement: "The United States has more
important issues to focus on at home than sending military aid or
deploying troops to deter a potential Russian invasion." Today, weeks
into the war, the partisan gap persists. In nearly every survey,
**[Republicans are less willing than Democrats to sanction Russia,
sanction Putin]{.underline}**, ban the importation of Russian oil and
gas, "**[send weapons]{.underline}** and supplies to Ukraine," help
Ukraine "obtain more fighter jets," send troops to Ukraine (even in
non-combat roles), "shoot down Russian military planes flying over
Ukraine," or conduct "air strikes on Russia." They're less willing to
support or participate in boycotts of Russian products, and they're more
willing to "promis\[e\] Russia that Ukraine will never join NATO." In
the latest Yahoo News survey, completed last Monday, the gap between the
parties remains wide. Seventy-six percent of Democrats say the United
States should take Ukraine's side; only 57 percent of Republicans agree.
Eighty percent of Democrats endorse "severe economic sanctions on
Russia"; again, only 57 percent of Republicans agree. Two-thirds of
Democrats prefer a "full Russian defeat"; only 51 percent of Republicans
agree. When respondents are asked whether "It's in America's best
interests to stop Russia and help Ukraine" or "The conflict is none of
America's business," 72 percent of Democrats say we should help Ukraine.
Fewer than half of Republicans share that view. Nor does the partisan
divide stop at Ukraine's borders. In polls taken since the invasion,
**[Republicans are less willing than Democrats to "maintain \[our\]
commitment to defend NATO]{.underline}** allies when they are attacked,"
"send U.S. troops to protect NATO allies near Ukraine," or keep "U.S.
military forces in NATO countries near Ukraine." Even when they're told
that "The U.S. and its European allies are obligated to defend countries
that belong to \[NATO\] if they are invaded by a foreign power,"
Republicans are less willing than Democrats to say we should respond
with force "if Russia were to invade a NATO member state." Together,
these numbers drive home an uncomfortable truth: As war returns to
Europe, America's soft underbelly isn't in the Biden administration.
It's in the GOP. The problem isn't just that rank-and-file Republicans
are relatively reluctant to stand up to Putin. It's that they don't
recognize their own passivity. They still think they represent a
muscular foreign policy. In every survey, they complain that Biden has
been "too weak," and they insist---more than Democrats do---that the
United States must get "tougher." But then, when they're asked about
measures that would actually get tougher, they flinch. If Republican
senators want America to stand strong against Putin, they should be
talking to their own voters. That would be leadership. And it would be
helpful, because no foreign intervention is sustainable without public
support at home. Instead, they're cracking soundbites about Bambi and
taking cheap shots at Biden. They're talking tough instead of being
tough. Just like their voters.

In early 2019, several months after President Donald Trump threatened to
upend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization during a trip to Brussels
for the alliance's annual summit, House lawmakers passed the NATO
Support Act amid overwhelming bipartisan support, with only 22
Republicans voting against the measure.

But this month, **[when a similar bill in support of NATO during the

The [**vote underscores the Republican** Party's **remarkable drift away

of the party.

The isolationist posture of some Republicans is in line with
the** **"America First" ethos of Trump, the GOP's de facto leader, who
has long railed against NATO. Last week, [[speaking at a Heritage
Foundation
event]{.underline}](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/22/trump-says-he-threatened-not-defend-nato-russia/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7) in
Florida, Trump implied that as president he had threatened not to defend
NATO allies from Russian attacks as a negotiating tactic to pressure
them to contribute more money toward the organization's shared defense.

The vote also comes against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine, which has catapulted NATO to its most prominent role in
decades. And it comes as some hawkish [**Republican**s seek to **cast
themselves as stronger opponents of Russia than
Democrats**.]{.underline}

Metin Hakverdi, a German lawmaker who chairs the North America working
group within the ruling Social Democratic Party, said the question that
preoccupies him is, "Was Donald Trump the exception, or will Joe Biden
be the exception?"

Some two dozen House GOP lawmakers who voted for the 2019 NATO Support
Act voted against the similar resolution this month, which reaffirmed
support for the alliance and its principles. But in interviews, several
of those House Republicans said they still support the organization and
simply objected to what they viewed as problematic provisions that
Democrats had added to the bill for perceived political purposes.

Several who switched their votes since 2019 objected to measures they
said did not specifically address strengthening NATO to help Ukraine.
[Rep. Barry Loudermilk]{.underline} (R-Ga.) [found it particularly
problematic that the resolution instructed NATO to be involved when a
country has "internal threats from proponents on
illiberalism,"]{.underline} which he says could be interpreted as
conservatism.

**["I am a huge supporter of NATO]{.underline}** --- I served in the Air
Force during the Cold War, worked with NATO during that time period," he
said. "**[These issues should be left to those individual
nations."]{.underline}**

Loudermilk argued that Democrats had inserted "poison pills" into the
symbolic resolution, which could be used against Republicans in the 2022
midterms. "It was the Democrats trying to politicize something and add
things in there that we have no business working on," he said,
explaining his vote against the bill.

Similarly, from Rep. Robert B. Aderholt (R-Ala.): "I am wholeheartedly,
unequivocally, without reservation, supportive on NATO."

But Aderholt said he worried that the [resolution "had some **language**
in that I thought **went on the political side**.]{.underline} And I
don't want to see NATO go political. I want to see NATO stand up for,
you know, what's going on in Ukraine --- stand up for Ukraine against
Russia."

The two bills are not exactly the same. The legislation in 2019
reaffirmed that federal money should not be used to remove the United
States from NATO --- which Trump was threatening at the time --- while
the bill from this month called on the government to "uphold the
founding democratic principles of NATO," as well for NATO "to continue
to provide unwavering support to the people of Ukraine as they fight for
their sovereignty, territorial integrity, and a democratic future."

#### The plan cordons off and alienates the Trump wing of the party

First, **[there are those who support Trump primarily because they agree
with the authoritarian, nationalist moral order he seeks to
establish.]{.underline}** We'll call them the
**[Nationalists]{.underline}**. Second, there are those who support
Trump primarily because they believe he embodies a cleansing of
establishment politics that has left white working-class people poorer
and forgotten over recent decades. We'll call them the Exasperated. The
Democrats might never hope to gain the support of Nationalists, for whom
Trump is a messianic figure---but they might hope to gain the support of
the Exasperated, who are wary of Trump and voted for him out of
frustration with the past few decades of politics, embodied by Hillary
Clinton. The **[Nationalists represent an enduring cult of personality.
They will be pleased by Trump's executive orders limiting immigration
and punishing sanctuary cities, not even necessarily because they
disdain immigrants, but rather because of what immigrants
represent.]{.underline}** When I spoke to them, these voters sensed that
**[they were losing control of their country and its identity, that they
were losing their place in the social hierarchy. Trump's "America First"
approach comforts them and reinforces the supremacy of white
people]{.underline}**. Trump is likely to maintain Nationalist support
until the bitter end, even if he is unable to deliver the economic
prosperity he promised, and even if his social agenda is ruled
unconstitutional. He will inevitably blame others, and this constituency
will believe it. Short of a microphone capturing him trashing these
supporters behind their backs, they represent his die-hard base.

#### Furthering divisions within the GOP opens door for DEMS to win midterms.

**Zurcher 22** (Anthony Zurcher. North America reporter for BBC News.
"Midterms 2022: What will Republicans do if They Win Congress?" BBC
News. May 3, 2022. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61280069)

When asked in January what his party would do if it regained control of
Congress next year, Senator Mitch McConnell - who would in all
likelihood run the chamber if Republicans prevail - was coy. \"That is a
very good question,\" he said. \"And I\'ll let you know when we take it
back\". In the House, it\'s a similar problem. Minority Leader Kevin
McCarthy has set up a taskforce to come up with a campaign agenda -
something easier said than done. When it was attempted prior to the
party\'s national convention in 2020, Republicans were unable to agree
on an electoral platform - the US political equivalent of a British
party manifesto. The platform for the re-election of Donald Trump was
instead simply a renewal of the 2016 document, even with its dated
references to Barack Obama and the \"failed\" incumbent president. The
apparent lack of focus is being felt by the rank-and-file voters whose
enthusiasm the party will need in November. At the February Conservative
Political Action Conference, or CPAC, a gathering of right-wing
activists and politicians in Florida, more than one attendee was
unimpressed. \"I come to CPAC, and I hear a lot of blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah,\" said Florida resident Bernita Gigowski. \"And I just want
to yell out, \'but you\'ve been in office for 10 or 12 years and what
have you done?\'\" \"The Republican Party is currently going through
some growing pains,\" said Daniel Hopping, a college student attending
the conference. [**The lack of a cohesive Republican platform is, in
part, a reflection of the changes the party has undergone since Mr Trump
won the presidency in 2016, said Mr Hopping. \"We\'re becoming more of a
populist, limited-government, culturally-sound party rather than just,
\'let\'s just cut taxes and have a nice trade deal or
something.**\'\"]{.underline} As was the case for the Democrats during
the Trump years, a common foe can help cover obscure intra-party fault
lines. Among Republicans, the divides between the party\'s big-business,
corporate interests, the Christian evangelicals and the white
working-class voters who flocked to Mr Trump\'s America-First rhetoric
have been smoothed over but still run deep. But that temporary unity is
fragile, and comes with risks. **[After Republicans won the Senate and
held the House of Representatives in 2014, dissatisfaction among
rank-and-file voters - particularly on issues such as trade and
immigration - may have contributed to the success of Donald Trump\'s
anti-establishment presidential campaign. Those divides haven\'t
entirely vanished, and if Republicans take power next year, acrimony
over the direction of the party on social issues, trade, foreign policy
and immigration could re-emerge.]{.underline}**

### Election interference

#### Russia is interfering in the midterms to help Republicans -- the plan gives Democrats the tools to counter these efforts

[Leading Senate **Democrats** are sounding the **alarm about Russian
interference** **in the** 2022 **midterm** elections]{.underline}. A
group of 17 Senate Democrats led by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, chairwoman of
the Senate Rules Committee and Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, urged some of the
nation\'s top military, intelligence, and national security officials to
stay vigilant against interference in a new letter obtained by Insider.
[\"As the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to an increase in Russian
disinformation and warnings of potential cyberattacks, we urge you to
**ensure** that your agencies are **prepared to quickly and effectively
counter Russian influence campaigns** targeting the 2022
elections,\"]{.underline} the senators wrote in Thursday\'s letter. The
letter also cites an Insider report from March on how Putin\'s missteps
in Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, which has staunchly united the West
and bolstered the NATO alliance while isolating Moscow economically and
politically, c[ould spur the Kremlin to redouble its efforts **in
undermining Western democracy** through both cyber-hacking]{.underline}
and disinformation operations that are far cheaper to carry out than a
land war on the scale of the Ukraine invasion. \"Manipulating social
media is incredibly inexpensive compared to Javelins and ammunition,\"
Chris Rouland, the CEO of Phosphorus Cybersecurity, told Insider. [\"If
anything, **Russia would get more aggressive** in its manipulation of
social media because it\'s almost free compared to a
tank.\"]{.underline} Ex-NSA hacker David Kennedy, the CEO of TrustedSec,
told Insider that [\"Putin and the intelligence agencies are **going
to** look at how to **cause as much damage as possible**\"]{.underline}
through cyber operations. He added that the [US in particular is a
\"ripe target\" for continued Russian interference efforts because of
the major impact Russia had in influencing the 2016
election.]{.underline}

#### The link is unique---the GOP is fighting any effort over election integrity

**[Election officials are facing a barrage of cybersecurity threats as
the midterms approach.]{.underline}** But **[chances are slim that
Congress will pitch in any money to help out]{.underline}**. Their wish
list includes: More cyber testing for election office computer networks.
Cyber training for election workers and volunteers. Better physical
security to ensure outsiders and rogue staffers can't monkey with
election machines so they're unsafe to use. That's on top of money they
need for a suite of non-cyber challenges, including replacing staff
who've quit amid a wave of death threats against election workers,
inspired by former president Donald Trump's false claims of election
fraud, as Mike DeBonis and Amy Gardner report. Recent challenges The
money crunch is a common dilemma for election officials who've faced one
crisis after another in recent years, including Russian interference in
the 2016 contest, the coronavirus pandemic and disinformation campaigns
about elections from foreign and domestic sources. Congress has kicked
in to help --- including about \$800 million for election security
between 2016 and 2020 along with another \$400 million to run safe
elections during the coronavirus pandemic. But that's only a fraction of
what officials have said is necessary to make elections as secure as
possible. "When election officials don't have sufficient funds to run
elections, they have to make tough choices and the truth is those
choices can adversely impact the accessibility and security of
elections," David Levine, an election integrity fellow at the German
Marshall Fund's Alliance for Securing Democracy, told me. The big ask
**[Election funding proposals]{.underline}** **[have ranged from \$20
billion sought by Democratic election officials to a more modest request
for \$5 billion in the next budget cycle]{.underline}**. The Bipartisan
Policy Center has suggested spending about \$400 million annually on

more money regardless.

NEW YORK, 18 November 2021 -- Children and young people are nearly 50
per cent more likely than older people to believe that the world is
becoming a better place with each generation, according to a new
international survey by UNICEF and Gallup released ahead of World
Children's Day. The survey shows that [young people are]{.underline}
also [more likely to]{.underline} believe childhood itself has improved,
with overwhelming majorities believing that healthcare, education, and
physical safety are better for today\'s children than for their
parents\' generation. Yet, despite their optimism, young people are far
from naïve, expressing restlessness for action on climate change,
skepticism about information they consume on social media, and
struggling with feelings of depression and anxiety. They are far more
likely than older people to [**see themselves as global citizens**, and
more **likely to**]{.underline} [**embrace international cooperation to
tackle threats** like the COVID-19 pandemic.]{.underline}

The poll, The Changing Childhood Project, is the first of its kind to
ask multiple generations for their views on the world and what it is
like to be a child today. It surveyed more than 21,000 people across two
age cohorts (15-24 years old and 40 years old and up) in 21 countries.
Nationally representative surveys were undertaken in countries across
all regions -- Africa, Asia, Europe, and North and South America -- and
income levels. Overall, [the data paint a picture of young generations
as products of globalization.]{.underline} For example, [young
people]{.underline} (39 per cent) [are on average]{.underline} [almost
twice as likely as older people]{.underline} (22 per cent) [to identify
most with being part of the world, versus their own nation or
locale]{.underline}. With each additional year of age, people are on
average about one per cent less likely to identify as a global citizen.

Soaring turnout and big margins among **[young voters were central to
the Democratic victories]{.underline} in** the 2018 congressional and
2020 presidential elections. But with many young people expressing
disenchantment with President Joe Biden\'s performance, **[preserving
those advantages looms as one of the biggest challenges facing Democrats
in the 2022 midterms]{.underline}**. [There\'s widespread concern among
Democrats that turnout for young people this November could fall back
from its gains in 2018 toward the meager levels that contributed to the
party\'s crushing losses in the 2014 and 2010 midterm
elections.]{.underline} [\"If you accept the status quo with young
people, it\'s not going to go great]{.underline},\" says Democratic
pollster Ben Tulchin. \"[Turnout is not going to be good]{.underline}.\"
My stern warning to the Biden administration and Democrats is you have
to take this seriously, because if we do go back to a 2010 or 2014 model
where they really fall off it\'s going to make it very difficult for us
in November. BEN TULCHIN, A DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER Most Republicans are
expecting exactly that sort of decline, driven both by waning enthusiasm
for Biden and diminishing concern about Donald Trump, whose visibility
has dimmed since he left the White House. \"We are seeing that [younger
voters who were voting in some of these elections because of Trump
don\'t seem to be inspired by Biden, and I think their turnout will fall
back to traditional levels]{.underline},\" says GOP consultant John
Brabender. Some structural dynamics may help to sustain youth turnout
this fall. Many experts note that the large youth turnout of 2018 and
2020 creates momentum for continued participation, because people who
register and vote in one election are more likely to vote in the next.
Over the past two elections, Democrats and nonpartisan groups have built
a significant organizational infrastructure to engage more young voters,
and those efforts are continuing through 2022. \"The elevated youth
turnout and the elevated youth registration and participation that we
saw from \'16 to \'18 to \'20 is not magic,\" says Nsé Ufot, chief
executive officer of the New Georgia Project, a non-profit voter
registration and mobilization group founded by Stacey Abrams. \"It is
absolutely a direct result of our investment and our labor and targeting
that particular group.\"

compromise of thousands of local governments and organizations by a
massive Microsoft breach and a recent hack of a Florida public water
facility has also added urgency to getting resources to states. Clarke
also pushed to include cybersecurity funding in **[Biden\'s \$2.2
trillion dollar infrastructure package.]{.underline}** The package
**[does not currently make any specific mentions of cybersecurity. The
absence has attracted criticism from both lawmakers and industry
groups.]{.underline}** "I believe the administration\'s infrastructure
package, the American Jobs Plan, is an opportunity to ensure that
security is integrated or baked into critical infrastructure projects at
the beginning and not tacked on at the end or patched up along the way,"
she said. Current and former officials see the infrastructure package as
the perfect vehicle for getting resources to states and local
governments who often rely on out-of-date technology more susceptible to
cyberattacks. Former Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
director Chris Krebs at a separate event at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies also pushed for cybersecurity investments in
infrastructure. \"I really think that that **[it is well past time for a

Public opinion lessons for AI regulation Brookings
https://www.brookings.edu/research/public-opinion-lessons-for-ai-regulation/

**[An overwhelming majority of the American public believes that
artificial intelligence (AI) should be carefully managed.]{.underline}**
Nevertheless, as the three case studies in this brief show, the public
does not agree on the proper regulation of AI applications. Indeed,
population-level support of an AI application may belie opposition by
some subpopulations[. Many AI applications, such as facial recognition
technology, could cause disparate harm to already vulnerable subgroups,
particularly ethnic minorities and low-income individuals]{.underline}.
In addition, partisan divisions are likely to prevent government
regulation of AI applications that could be used to influence electoral
politics. In particular, the regulation of content recommendation
algorithms used by social media platforms has been highly contestable.
Finally, mobilizing an influential group of political actors, such as
machine learning researchers in the campaign against lethal autonomous
weapons, may be more effective in shifting policy debates than
mobilizing the public at large. AI is a general-purpose technology that
enables machines to perform tasks that previously required human
intelligence. As a result, it has a wide range of commercial and
security applications. **[A 2018 survey conducted by the Center for the
Governance of AI found that 84% of the American public believes that AI
is a technology that should be carefully managed.]{.underline}**
Furthermore, the survey suggests that Americans consider most AI
governance challenges to have high issue importance, as seen in Figure 1
below. This brief focuses on how public opinion will likely shape the
regulation of three applications of AI in the U.S.: facial recognition
technology used by law enforcement, algorithms used by social media
platforms, and lethal autonomous weapons. These case studies were
selected because they involve AI governance issues that the American
public characterize as either highly likely to impact them in the next
decade or important for tech companies and governments to manage.
Political debates around these applications touch on central themes
articulated in numerous AI ethics principles, including fairness,
privacy, and safety. As shown in the figure below, Americans predict
some of these governance challenges as more likely to impact Americans
in the next decade than others. [**The issues thought to be the most
likely to impact Americans and rated the highest in issue importance
include** preventing AI-assisted surveillance from violating privacy and
civil liberties, preventing AI from being used to spread **fake and
harmful content online**, preventing AI **cyberattacks**, and protecting
data privacy]{.underline}

### Biotech

#### Voters Overwhelmingly Support government prioritization, and continued investment of biotech - polls prove

Think About the Biotechnology Industry?

But, how do you think most American voters responded? To find out the
answer to that question, BIO, with the bipartisan pairing of Public
Opinion Strategies and Hart Research Associates (the same team that
produces the respected Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll), conducted a
national survey of 800 American voters to find out what they think about
the biotechnology industry. One of the most interesting findings was
that during the current economic slowdown, while our elected leaders are
making hard choices about our national economic priorities, **[a
majority (53 percent) of American voters believe the federal government
should support the biotechnology industry through either direct funding
or beneficial tax policies]{.underline}**. Role of Government in Biotech
Role of Government Without providing any background information, 48
percent of those surveyed had a favorable impression of the industry
while only 12 percent had an unfavorable impression (the rest had no
opinion**[). After hearing just a brief, neutral explanation of the work
conducted by biotech companies]{.underline}**, voters' impression of our
industry improves dramatically. In fact, **[the number of voters with a
favorable impression increased to 87 percent]{.underline}** after
hearing the description - while only 11 percent had an unfavorable
impression and the rest had no opinion. The Image of Biotechnology
Companies Image of Biotech Furthermore, the [survey indicates that
American voters support a continued federal commitment to biotechnology
priorities such as research dedicated to finding alternative sources of
energy, life-saving medicines and cures]{.underline}. In fact, the
survey [found that many of the biotechnology industry\'s important
issues are ranked by voters as either \"extremely\" or \"very\"
important -]{.underline} behind only the economy, education, reducing
the deficit/government spending - and alongside of issues such as
combating terrorism and reducing taxes. Over three-quarters of voters
[(76 percent) are supportive of a continued commitment to federal
spending on biotech research after hearing that the industry is working
to cure diseases such as Alzheimer\'s, cancer, diabetes and
Parkinson\'s]{.underline} - and that these cures can eventually help
patients live longer, healthier lives, cut federal health care spending
and in the process save the American budget trillions of dollars.
Overall, the survey results shed a positive light on the average
American's views of the biotechnology industry. As previously mentioned,
[voters rated the importance of finding cures as one of the most
important issues and a majority of those voters say that it should be a
top or high priority for Congress]{.underline} to commit to continued
funding for research focused on alternative energy and finding cures for
our most deadly diseases.

6-27-2022

**[Can Biden turn his political fortunes around? June]{.underline}**, as
the Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik recently pointed out, **[is more
or less the last chance in a midterm-election year for a President and
his party to somehow change course and avert a looming political debacle
in the fall. "In the last four midterm elections, by June the public had
made up its mind]{.underline}** about the leadership in Washington and
how they were going to vote in November," Sosnik observed. Which means
that **[Biden has a few weeks, at best, to somehow revive an approval
rating that currently stands in Trumpian territory]{.underline}**: an
average of 40.8 per cent approval, 54 per cent disapproval, according to
the political Web site FiveThirtyEight. It's one reason, among many bad
indicators for Democrats, that forecasters right now predict Republicans
will take over the House this fall, and very likely the Senate as well.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report projects Democratic losses of
twenty to thirty-five seats in the House, where Republicans need just a
handful of wins to gain control. And **[what will happen in
June?]{.underline}** The Supreme Court will likely decide to overturn
**[Roe v. Wade]{.underline}**. Democrats in the House will try and fail
to pass **[Biden's assault-weapons ban]{.underline}**. There will be
**[more fighting in Ukraine, and the very real possibility
that]{.underline}**, despite the influx of American weapons, **[Russia
will continue to make territorial gains]{.underline}** in the country's
east and inflict heavy casualties. Inflation shows little sign of
receding; gas prices may reach record highs. This week, Jamie Dimon, the
C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, warned of an economic "hurricane" that could
push oil from its current price of a hundred and nineteen dollars a
barrel---which currently seems nightmarishly high---all the way up to a
hundred and fifty dollars per barrel, or even a hundred and
seventy-five. According to the American Automobile Association, gas
prices at the pump, reportedly the metric that is obsessing Biden's
White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, are currently averaging \$4.76
per gallon nationally---up from \$3.04 a year ago. covid-19 has not
disappeared either, and new variants suggest the possibility of
additional spikes this fall. **[Not all of these events will necessarily
boost Republicans. Some may even benefit Biden]{.underline}**. Polls
suggest that the leak of the Supreme Court's draft abortion ruling
caused a surge in support for abortion rights. A Gallup poll found
support for abortion rights at its highest level since 1995; a Wall
Street Journal survey found that fifty-seven per cent of Americans back
a woman's right to a legal abortion for any reason, the highest level
since the question was first asked by the publication's pollster, in
1977. If Roe is indeed thrown out, Democrats are hoping to generate a
wave of anger-fuelled support this fall, especially among
independent-leaning female voters, who were key to the Party's success
in retaking the House in the 2018 midterms and holding it in 2020.
**[June will also mark the opening of public hearings]{.underline}** by
the select committee **[investigating the January 6th
attack]{.underline}** on the Capitol, prime-time proceedings that Jamie
Raskin, one of the panel's Democratic members, has promised will "blow
the roof off the House." Evidence of Trump's plot to illegally overturn
the 2020 election results---and Republicans' complicity beforehand and
refusal to disavow it afterward---will, at a minimum, reinforce Biden's
message to Democratic voters that they must turn out to avoid handing
more power to the "ultra maga" and "extreme" forces now controlling the
G.O.P. (However, many Republicans, it should be noted, have already
started appropriating Biden's insult as a compliment. "I am ultra maga
and I am proud of it," Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House
Republican, recently said.) And, **[besides, reminding voters of Trump's
perfidy]{.underline}** is not the same thing as resurrecting Biden's
political standing. **[If the President wants his supporters to turn out
this fall, he needs to convince them, once again, of his leadership.
Biden's speech]{.underline}** on Thursday night was not aimed at
Republicans. It almost certainly **[will not miraculously produce an end

### Uniqueness -- econ 

#### Dems will lose the election because Biden is blamed for the bad economy.

(CNN)President Joe **[Biden]{.underline}** and his
**[administration]{.underline}** appear **[perilously close to an
irreversible severing of public confidence in his capacity to deliver
prosperity and financial security as stiff economic challenges balloon
into huge political liabilities.]{.underline}** A CNN
**[poll]{.underline}** released Wednesday **[shows]{.underline}** that
the **[President\'s]{.underline}** repeated **[efforts]{.underline}**
**[to highlight]{.underline}** undeniably **[strong aspects of the
economy\'s post-pandemic rebound and to offset blame for its bad spots
aren\'t working.]{.underline}** The main culprit is inflation, a
corrosive force that the White House initially underestimated and has
failed to tame. It\'s been decades since Americans have experienced this
demoralizing cycle of spiraling costs for basic goods and services. That
shock is twinned with punishing gasoline prices that also hammer family
budgets and spread pain across the population \-- in a way that a
regular recession, which can destroy millions of jobs but not hurt
everyone \-- may not. CNN Poll: Most Americans have a dismal view of the
US economy CNN Poll: Most Americans have a dismal view of the US economy
The result is a **[looming political disaster for
Democrats]{.underline}**, with voters in a disgruntled mood ahead of
midterm elections that were already historically tough for a first-term
President. The depth of voter disquiet about the economy also suggests
that a potential backlash against the Supreme Court possibly overturning
the nationwide right to abortion may not save Democrats in November. The
party seems stuck in a dangerous political position of insisting the
economy is doing well while voters think it\'s in the tank. The CNN
poll, conducted by SSRS from April 28 to May 1, showed that a
**[majority of Americans think Biden\'s policies have hurt the
economy]{.underline}**, while **[8 in 10 say the government is not doing
enough to combat inflation.]{.underline}** It was released on the same
day the Federal Reserve made its biggest swing against the rising cost
of living in 22 years. White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein
admitted on CNN on Thursday that some households are \"experiencing
extreme discomfort\" because of inflation, but said some were in a
better position because of the strong job market. \"So I think you have
to be more nuanced when you\'re trying to assess the economy \... we\'re
doing all we can to try to help ease these inflationary pressures,\"
Bernstein told Brianna Keilar on \"New Day.\" He pointed to White House
efforts to end supply chain blockages, to tackle port congestion, to
lower energy prices and the release of millions of barrels of oil from
strategic reserves among other measures. Bernstein is right about the
external factors pushing inflation. But the problem for the White House
is that nuance is the first thing that goes missing in political
campaigns and voter anguish offers an easy opening for Republicans. The
Federal Reserve raised interest rates by half a percentage point, but it
triggered a stocks rally by indicating that despite adjustments to come,
it did not anticipate further huge spikes in the price of borrowing.
\"I\'d like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the American
people,\" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said at the start of a
news conference. \"Inflation is much too high, and we understand the
hardship it is causing. We are moving expeditiously to bring it back
down.\" Yet the strikingly direct moment may not quell concerns that the
Fed and the White House have acted too slowly to tackle inflation, are
not using sufficiently aggressive methods to ease it and may still be
overtaken by global factors, including the war in Ukraine and the
fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, which clogged supply chains, sent
energy prices soaring and triggered other rising prices. Fed raises
interest rates as it tries to catch up with inflation 02:00 What the
interest rate hike means The rate increase will make new home and car
loans and payments on credit card balances more expensive. But in the
process, it could cool the housing market, making it easier to buy a
home and taking the heat out of rising prices. Justin Wolfers, a
professor of economics at the University of Michigan, explained that
Americans could see results from the rate hikes in their daily lives, as
inflation simmers at the highest levels since Ronald Reagan\'s 1980s
presidency. Here&#39;s how higher rates will impact you Here\'s how
higher rates will impact you \"What the Fed is hoping to do is cool
inflation a little so your paycheck will go a little further, although
that will mean slowing the economy and that might mean a little less
bargaining power for workers and fewer prospects of a wage rise anytime
soon,\" Wolfers said on CNN\'s \"Newsroom.\" The White House is showing
clear signs of frustration that inflation is overshadowing the strong
aspects of an economy that appears in remarkably robust shape \--
despite a small contraction of 1.4% in the first quarter \-- given the
cataclysm of a two-year pandemic and the worst war in Europe since 1945.
Biden, for example, on Wednesday touted cuts in the federal budget
deficit and an unemployment rate that is approaching 50-year lows in a
speech that appeared to be an attempt to get ahead of the Fed
announcement and to signal resolve. **[Yet his political plight is
underscoring why inflation remains a force that is dreaded by political
leaders everywhere.]{.underline}** Home buyers aren\'t using a realtor.
Here\'s what they\'re doing instead 02:42 Despite Republican claims in
midterm campaign ads that Biden\'s public spending policies are the sole
cause of inflation, the President is correct to identify outside
factors, including the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, as the main
drivers of rising prices. But the reality doesn\'t mean voters will give
Biden a pass. It\'s the nature of the job that when the country is in a
grim mood, the President gets the blame. And when the White House\'s
efforts to explain the problems and fix them have sometimes been muddled
and too late, the political damage mounts. Biden may never shake off the
initial White House line that high inflation was a \"transitory\" phase
coming out of the pandemic. And while the economy is strong in many
areas, voters\' perception is often more important politically than the
data that tells the real story. A daunting poll for the White House The
CNN poll, for example, says that only 23% of Americans rate economic
conditions as even somewhat good, down from 37% in December. The last
time public perception of the economy was this poor in CNN\'s polling
was November 2011. Only 34% approve of Biden\'s management of the
economy. And his approval rating on helping the middle class \-- 36% \--
is devastating for a President who has made that issue the foundation of
his political career. The question of public perception versus the true
state of the economy is also borne out in the poll. Americans said by
nearly 4 to 1 that they were more likely to hear bad news than good news
about the economy. Some 94% of Republicans rate economic conditions as
poor. This suggests that views of the economy may be shaped by partisan
leanings as much as a neutral judgment of conditions. Conservative news
channels keep a constant drumbeat of horror stories about rising prices,
and Republicans have made the issue an effective campaign tool while
hyping the strength of ex-President Donald Trump\'s economic
performance. Yet 81% of independents and 54% of Democrats also think the
economy is poor, suggesting that **[Biden has taken a hit among some of
the voters who put him in office.]{.underline}** Americans are more
positive about their own finances than about the national economic
situation, with 53% saying they\'re satisfied with their personal
financial situations. That could again indicate that a wider sense of
malaise is coloring views of the economy. Still, that figure is down
from 66% in 2016.

slimmest possible majority. The legislative body has 50 Republican
members and 48 Democrats, as well as two independents who caucus with
their Democratic colleagues. With that even split, Vice President
[Kamala Harris](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/kamala-harris), in her

At the same time, most of these seats are considered safe, as they are
held by incumbents in states that largely vote for Democrats or

the most competitive in the 2022 election cycle, although some are more
likely to flip than others. Notably, while [**Republicans may manage to

In the Democrats\' uphill struggle to retain control of Congress, Donald
Trump and his MAGA movement may be their best friends. [Polling by
Priorities
USA](http://priorities.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/June-2022-Press-Briefing.pdf),
a Democratic SuperPAC, found that **[Democrats would lose narrowly to
Republicans among targeted voters when people were simply asked if they
wanted a Democrat or a Republican in office. On that generic ballot
question, Republicans got 44% of the surveyed -- which include
battleground state persuadable voters]{.underline}** and those who are
at least somewhat unmotivated to vote this fall -- while Democrats got
41% support. That small difference could be pivotal in Senate and
gubernatorial races in those states. But when Trump and his Make America
Great Again agenda are brought into the picture, it brightens for
Democrats, the polling found. When those polled were asked to choose
between a Democrat who supports President Joe Biden and a Republican who
supports the MAGA movement, 37% chose the Democrat and 30% picked the
Republican. The divide was even bigger when it got more personal: Asked
if they\'d prefer a Democrat who supports Biden or a Republican who
supports Trump, those polled preferred the Democrat to the Republican,
41% to 31%. On that question, the hypothetical Democrat got 11% of GOP
voters who picked the Republican in the generic ballot question and 32%
of third-party voters who initially went with the GOP contender. [**The
survey is based on very circumscribed voters, including \"persuasion
voters\" -- basically swing voters -- in the battleground states of
Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and
Michigan as well as \"mobilization\" voters, people who are inclined to
vote Democratic but whose disinterest or dispiritedness make them less
likely to show up at the polls this fall. That group was surveyed in the
six battlegrounds as well as Colorado, Florida and North
Carolina.**]{.underline} But it also shows Democrats what they need to
do to hang onto critical Senate seats, gubernatorial posts and some
House seats this fall, Priorities USA Chairman Guy Cecil told reporters
in a conference call. \"What Trump and MAGA are doing is producing
cross-pressure for these persuadable voters,\" Cecil said. \"They\'re
frustrated\" about the state of the country, but \"they\'re not terribly
happy about voting for Trump or a MAGA candidate,\" he said. \"Drawing
on that contrast is a necessity if we\'re going to be successful.\"

"They think that we're divisive and too focused on cultural issues. They
think that we're preachy. They think that we act like we know better

us." **[Republicans need a net gain of just five seats to retake the

**[Among the most frequently cited observations about
politics]{.underline}** --- along with "it all comes down to turnout"
and "a week is a lifetime" --- **[is]{.underline}** this factoid about
midterm elections: **["Since World War II, the party holding the White
House has suffered an average loss of 26 House seats and four Senate
seats."]{.underline}** **[This is correct, but it's not
right]{.underline}** --- at least not as an accurate measure of what has
happened in the last several dozen midterms. **[It's misleading in the
same way it would be to put Bill Gates in a room with nine indigents and
conclude that their average worth was \$13 billion.]{.underline}** The
more accurate way to look at midterms is that there is no good way to
summarize them. True, only two elections have seen the White House's
party actually gain seats, but there are several where the losses have
been minimal, or non-existent, or where each house of Congress has
produced different results. The problem for Joe Biden is that this more
nuanced history provides almost no encouraging news. If Democrats are to
survive November with their congressional majorities intact, they're
going to have to pray Republicans really step in it in a few key races.
The most memorable midterms are those that featured huge losses for the
party occupying the White House: 1946, when the discontent with the
tumultuous post-war environment swept the Republicans into power in both
houses of Congress 1958, when Democrats won 49 House seats and 15 Senate
seats amid a nasty recession, giving them control that lasted for 22
years in the Senate and 36 years in the House 1974, when voters punished
the Republican Party for Watergate, giving Democrats 49 new House seats
and four in the Senate 1994, when the collapse of the Clinton health
plan gave Republicans both houses of Congress with 54 House and four
Senate seats 2006, when the Iraq quagmire and a series of GOP corruption
scandals turned both houses over to Democrats 2010, when the slow pace
of recovery from the Great Recession and a clumsy start to Obamacare
gave the Republicans 63 seats and control of the House 2014, when nine
Democratic Senate seats --- and control of the body --- fell to
Republicans (thus giving Barack Obama the dubious distinction of being
the only two-term president in living memory to suffer two midterm
disasters). Much **[less well remembered are the midterms where the
president's party escaped serious damage. There are]{.underline}**, of
course, **[the two elections where they actually gained seats ---
1998]{.underline}**, thanks to a booming economy and Republican
impeachment overreach, **[and 2002]{.underline}**, when the post-9/11
"rally round the flag" sentiment was still high. But **[many other
midterms were effectively a wash]{.underline}**. In
**[1962]{.underline}**, just weeks after the successful resolution of
the Cuban Missile Crisis, John F. Kennedy's Democratic Party only lost
four House seats and gained four Senate seats. In
**[1970]{.underline}**, with dissent over the Vietnam War, and with Vice
President Spiro Agnew denouncing "radical liberals" and a biased news
media, the GOP lost 12 House seats while the Democrats lost three Senate
seats --- one to Conservative Party New Yorker James Buckley. In
**[1978]{.underline}**, President Jimmy Carter saw Democrats lose 15
House seats and three Senate seats. Meanwhile, **[1990]{.underline}**
provided the "Seinfeld midterms" where more or less nothing happened.
George H.W. Bush's Republicans lost only seven seats in the House and
one in the Senate. What unites all of these contests is not only the
relatively small change in the lineups, but also the fact that **[none
of these elections changed control of either chamber of
Congress]{.underline}**. This is where Democrats can take little if any
comfort from the midterm elections where the president's party took only
political flesh wounds. Not that long ago, that 1990 result would have
been cause for celebration in a White House. This November, however, the
net loss of seven House seats and a single Senate seat would turn both
chambers over to Republicans. Beyond the numbers, however, it's hard to
see in current surveys or in the underlying political terrain anything
that history says aids the Democrats. In 1998, even Clinton's full-blown
sex scandal was not enough to inflict political damage on his party: The
economy was producing full employment, low inflation, real wage growth
and enormous budget surpluses. Today, low unemployment and solid wage
growth is overshadowed by inflation. The relative unity George W. Bush
enjoyed among the public in 2002 --- with the memory of 9/11 fresh and
before the Iraq War had begun --- is almost wholly absent today.
Republicans may be divided between those who charge that Biden's
weakness provoked Putin and those who think him a neocon warmonger, but
few are standing behind the president. The backlash over campus and
urban disorder that kept GOP losses relatively small in 1970 has been
replaced now by cultural matters --- over race, crime, classroom
teaching --- that threaten Democrats with further erosion of the white
working-class vote. And a sour national mood, after two years of a
pandemic, has helped drive Biden's approval ratings down to about 40
percent --- a presidential approval number that has in the past foretold
midterm disaster. **[It's true]{.underline}**, as Democrats keep
reminding each other, **[that the picture can change]{.underline}**;
maybe by autumn we'll be back to normal. Maybe inflation will ease.

counties. Both their turnout numbers and their party preferences hold
keys to the results.

### A2 Roe

#### Republicans will win the midterms -- the only way Dems could have won was through basing the ballot on codifying Roe v. Wade, which they have failed to do.

years, winner of George Polk Award for Legal Reporting; "Democrats Can

**[Democrats hope to make November's midterm elections a referendum on
Roe v. Wade,]{.underline}** the linchpin decision upholding abortion
rights, which the Supreme Court is almost certain to strike down this
summer. That strategy makes sense. Polls show that roughly **[two in
three Americans oppose overturning Roe]{.underline}** and almost 60
percent support passing a bill to set Roe's protections in a federal
law. What's more, **[polls showed a rising number of voters listing
abortion as their top midterm issue]{.underline}** after news of Roe's
imminent demise leaked in the form of a draft court opinion published by
Politico. Unfortunately, **[their current plan is]{.underline}** almost
**[sure to fail]{.underline}**. After the Democrats came up with just 49
votes to bring a Roe-protecting bill before the Senate on May 11, they
promised to keep fighting and, in the words of Senator Amy Klobuchar,
"take that fight right to the ballot box" in November. But you can't
make an election into a referendum on an issue if you can't point to
anything winning the election would accomplish. To make the 2022
elections a referendum on Roe, **[Democrats have to put protecting Roe
and abortion rights on the table.]{.underline}**

#### Roe v Wade won't impact the midterms - Democrats are still set to lose

**Panetta 5/13/22**

Alexander Panetta is a Washington-based correspondent for CBC News who
has covered American politics and Canada-U.S. issues since 2013. He
previously worked in Ottawa, Quebec City and internationally, reporting
on politics, conflict, disaster and the Montreal Expos. "Will abortion
upend American politics? Here\'s what the early polling tells us," May
13, 2021,
https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/abortion-american-politics-early-polls-1.6451553

The short answer: **[Voters aren\'t budging]{.underline}**. The longer
answer is polls show subtle shifts[. If abortion is about to transform
American politics, it\'s only barely registering]{.underline} so far in
the initial public reaction to a draft decision of the U.S. Supreme
Court[. The early numbers **don\'t speak to a** seismic **shift in
opinion**. A faint rumble, perhaps. We now have several polls to judge
public reaction to last week\'s bombshell news of an unpublished ruling
by the country\'s top court.]{.underline} That leaked draft suggests the
court is set to overturn a five-decade precedent that abortion access is
a constitutional right and would instead let states set their own
policy. Democrats have quickly pivoted to abortion as a potential
winning message in this fall\'s state and congressional midterm
elections. The issue is seen as one way to galvanize young voters, whose
recent disenchantment puts the majority party at risk of a severe
wipeout. Democrats\' bid to enshrine Roe v. Wade abortion access as
federal law fails in U.S. Senate The future of the U.S. abortion battle:
Think pills, not clinics Making abortion the ballot-box question would
also allow Democrats to side with the majority of Americans who
consistently tell pollsters they want Roe v. Wade to remain intact. That
strategy was on display this week as Democrats held a no-hope vote in
Congress to pass a law on abortion rights, then turned it into a midterm
message. Vice-President Kamala Harris stood outside the Senate chamber
and said abortion is now an issue for the voters to decide --- the
argument being that holding the Senate would allow Democrats to confirm
more pro-choice judges and perhaps even pass a law if they win extra
seats. After Democrats were unable to pass a vote in the Senate this
week on abortion rights, Vice-President Kamala Harris told reporters
that the issue will now have to be decided by voters in this fall\'s
midterm elections. \"\[This\] makes clear that a priority for all who
care about this issue --- the priority should be to elect pro-choice
leaders,\" the vice-president said. \"At the local, the state and the
federal level.\" What the headline numbers say U.S. President Joe Biden
tweeted a similar message --- as have numerous other Democrats who argue
that only midterm election voters can prevent abortion rights from
disappearing across an estimated two-dozen states if the Supreme Court
draft decision holds when the ruling is ultimately handed down. But
those voters aren\'t budging. At least not yet. What several new polls
say in a nutshell is that Biden remains unpopular; his party remains in
peril; and those numbers haven\'t changed at all. U.S. [law
professor]{.underline} Kimberly Wehle [says she wasn\'t surprised by the

Politico, shows 46% of voters want a GOP-controlled Congress while 46%
want Democrats in charge. With speculation buzzing over whether the
potential doom of Roe v. Wade will have a political impact, the needle
didn't move much for either party. Dating back to March, 46% of voters
still picked the GOP and that percentage was the same dating back to
August 2021. Democrats only saw a 2% uptick from March polling; in
August polling, 47% of voters preferred Democrats. The poll's margin for

### A2 Readiness

#### No impact to readiness

**George 99** (James L. George, former congressional professional staff
member for national security affairs, "Is Military Readiness Overrated?"
CATO, 5-27-1999,
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/is-military-readiness-overrated)

Military readiness promises to be a major issue when Congress marks up a
defense bill later this year. Some members of Congress are already using
readiness as a reason to increase funding in the emergency spending bill
for the war in Yugoslavia. Most experts cite the initial stages of the
Korean War and the Hollow Force of the late 1970s as cautionary examples
of being ill-prepared. A closer look at both those examples, however,
shows that they really had little to do with readiness. Moreover, the
current crisis in Yugoslavia illustrates once again why **[readiness may
be overrated]{.underline}** and the funds better spent elsewhere.
Although **[often used as a generic term for all military
capabilities]{.underline}**, readiness---defined as the ability to
respond with appropriate force with little or no warning---is only one
of four pillars of military preparedness. The other pillars are force
structure, modernization and sustainability. Thus, **[an effective
military force depends on much more than just readiness]{.underline}**.
Interestingly, **[the two favorite examples cited by readiness alarmists
fail to prove their case]{.underline}**. The performance of **[Task
Force Smith]{.underline}**, an ill-prepared battalion quickly sent to
the front and fairly **[easily routed by the North
Koreans]{.underline}** during the initial days of the Korean War, is
often cited as the worst case. "No More Task Force Smiths" has become a
mantra for the Army. However, critics of Task Force Smith fail to point
out that U.S. commanders made the most basic of military
mistakes---including grossly underestimating the enemy and sending TFS
to an exposed position. When such blunders occur, the end result will be
the same whether it is an ill-trained Task Force Smith in Korea or
well-trained Marines in Beirut or elite Rangers in Somalia. **[Moreover,
critics also fail to mention that barely a month later the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[stabilized the
situation in South Korea]{.underline}**, and in another month the
Marines conducted their famous Inchon Landing. In fact, without the
Chinese intervention, the United States would have won the Korean War a
few months after it began. Not bad for a U.S. force that was supposedly
ill-prepared. **[Similarly, the Hollow Force of the late 1970s was not
primarily a readiness problem but a combination of many
factors---including]{.underline}** a military characterized by low
morale after Vietnam, **[serious drug and racial problems, the erroneous
induction of too many mentally substandard recruits and low pay eroded
further by high inflation]{.underline}**. At the same time, **[major
structural changes]{.underline}** were transforming the U.S. military,
including the introduction of women into the regular forces, **[the
switch from a draft to an all-volunteer force and the initiation of the
Total Force Concept that placed more reliance on the
Reserves]{.underline}**. Given all of that turbulence, no wonder we had
a Hollow Force. **[Often overlooked, however, is how quickly those
problems were solved]{.underline}**. In some cases, solutions were found
without spending a dime. For example, Chief of Naval Operations Adm.
Thomas Hayward instituted his "Not in my Navy" program of zero tolerance
for drugs. The drug problem was solved almost overnight. The induction
of too many mentally substandard recruits by mistake which had lowered
standards, was identified and corrected. That correction solved most
other personnel problems (and should be a warning to people who want to
lower standards today). Some members of Congress are now using the
crisis in Yugoslavia to get more funds for readiness by arguing that the
military is now stretched "too thin." (Congress doubled President
Clinton's request for \$6 billion in emergency spending for the war.) In
fact, the situation is quite the opposite. **[Leaving aside the question
of whether the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[should
even be involved]{.underline}** in Yugoslavia, the new Clinton Doctrine,
which does not plan to use ground troops ( a position that is supported
by many Republicans), limits the stress placed on the military. Those
**[decisions are all deliberate political actions that have absolutely
nothing to do with readiness]{.underline}**. **[Under a well-conceived
strategy, even a modestly capable force will probably perform well; but
under a poorly conceived strategy, even a force with the highest degree
of readiness will probably have serious problems]{.underline}**. The
experiences of Task Force Smith and the Hollow Force, as well as the
invocation of a Clinton Doctrine that eschews the use of ground forces,
have major implications. More forces, for example, could be placed in
the reserves and scarce funds spent elsewhere. In addition, the military
could switch to what Sen. John McCain (R- Ariz.) has called "Tiered
Readiness:" a few forces would be kept on expensive ready status and be
augmented by reserve forces that could be mobilized if a substantial
threat to U.S. security arose. Military readiness is certainly
important, and no one is suggesting a return to the truly shallow force
of the late 1940s or the Hollow Force of the 1970s. But a close look at
those forces shows that their difficulties involved much more than just
poor readiness.

#### The welfare state is key to sustaining the American military

**Mittelstadt 18** (2018, Jennifer, Jennifer Mittelstadt is a Professor
of History at Rutgers University and is the Harold K. Johnson Chair in
Military History at the US Army War College; her work about the
relationship between the welfare state and the military has been
published by the Harvard University Press, "FOR AMERICA, WELFARE IS
ESSENTIAL FOR WARFARE", War On The Rocks,
<https://warontherocks.com/2018/05/for-america-welfare-is-essential-for-warfare/)>

In 2015 I published a book called [The Rise of the Military Welfare
State](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674286139) that
chronicled the history of military benefits and social services in the
all-volunteer force. For many in the military, the title constituted
fighting words. I didn't anticipate this when I chose it. Some
commenters asked if I thought soldiers were "welfare queens." Others
assumed I was out to cut their benefits. More than a few were angry
enough to wish violence on me. If I had a quarter for every incensed
email and suspicious question I've received, I'd have pocketed far more
money than book sales have generated. The title aroused hostility in
part due to the widely held belief that the military is separate from
civilian life and especially the civilian welfare state. While
**[military personnel partake of subsidized housing, health care, child
care, and many more systems of valuable support]{.underline}**, most
Americans -- and military personnel -- consider those programs "not
social welfare," but a taken-for-granted entitlement in return for the
perceived sacrifices of military life. The differentiation between
military benefits and welfare goes even further than drawing bright
lines between similar programs in different settings. The distinction
shapes fundamental choices of where the nation invests in national
power. The military and welfare are depicted as opposite poles in a
Manichean battle of the budget. Too many political leaders and policy
makers set up a zero-sum game scenario in which they pit ["military
spending" against "welfare
spending"](https://www.ohio.com/akron/editorial/commentary/robert-j-samuelson-the-case-for-increasing-defense-spending),
claiming the former is more important than the latter. Others assume
that social welfare for civilians creates a weak, dependent society that
diminishes national power. The nation must therefore provide funds for
worthy "troops" and take them from unworthy "welfare recipients." For
some elected officials, every breath supporting men and women in uniform
is matched by a [blast to social welfare
spending](http://www.insidesources.com/paul-ryans-exit-spells-trouble-u-s-economy/).
These views reflect distorted understandings of social welfare and
defense, and, as I've learned in spending the past year at the [U.S.
Army War College](https://ssl.armywarcollege.edu/), they're harmful to
American national and military power. [My conversations with senior
leaders have made plain the central role of social welfare in creating
the conditions for both military power and national power. The military
and welfare are not opposites, **they're intertwined**.]{.underline}
Welfare is short-hand for "social welfare," which itself derives from
"the general welfare" of the populace enshrined alongside "the common
defense" in the United States Constitution. While Americans in recent
decades have used the word "welfare" pejoratively to signify
means-tested programs for the poor, historically welfare had a positive
connotation and broader definition. The majority of Americans of the
1950s, including the war hero and [Republican President Dwight D.
Eisenhower](https://millercenter.org/president/eisenhower/domestic-affairs),
for example, approved overwhelmingly of "welfare" and "the welfare
state." Health, education, old age pensions, disability protections,
workplace safety, minimum wages and maximum hours -- all these were
properly considered "welfare." [Even the tax system and subsidized home
loans constitute social welfare in the
US.](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/6220.html) Some Americans
receive social welfare through the government, some through private
charities. Most partake of both even when they don't know it; since the
1930s the government has [subsidized the supposedly "private" employer
benefits](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/7551.html) through tax
breaks to large companies, all in an effort to deliver as many social
and economic supports to as many Americans as possible. These [many
types of social welfare have built and continue to sustain military
power. Take the military's most basic requirement -- fielding a force.
The modern U.S. military has never been able to mobilize for war without
adequate welfare for its populace. It was precisely the poor health,
nutrition and education of many potential draftees during both [**World
War I and World War II** that **helped make the case for expanding
national social welfare
programs**](http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-01995-6.html).
Military and Selective Service officials as well as veterans
organizations made the case for social welfare programs for military
preparedness. [During the Cold War decades, the United States filled out
its welfare
state](https://www.amazon.com/Eisenhower-Republicanism-Pursuing-Middle-Way/dp/0875803628),
improving public education, creating food and nutrition programs, and
[fostering physical fitness programs to build "readiness" among youth
eligible for the draft](http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15804.html).
And since the era of the all-volunteer force began in 1973, **social
welfare has become even more essential**. Healthy, able, educated and
sound recruits are the **sine qua non** of the all-volunteer force, and
declines in public health and welfare harm the force]{.underline}.
Today, standards for military service preclude nearly [70 percent of the
youth
population](http://time.com/2938158/youth-fail-to-qualify-military-service/)
who cannot qualify for service -- they are too sick, too physically
unfit, or too undereducated. It has not been possible -- and **[it will
not be possible -- to fill the ranks to acceptable standards without
[basic investments in social
welfare](https://www.strongnation.org/missionreadiness)]{.underline}**.
If [the military needs strong social welfare programs to]{.underline}
fill the force, it also needs them to [utilize the force.]{.underline}
Military benefits and social services -- what I call [the military
welfare
state](https://aeon.co/essays/how-the-us-military-became-a-welfare-state)
-- have grown hand-in-hand with the volunteer force in order [to support
readiness in garrison and
deploymen](https://www.army.mil/article/168539/milley_soldier_readiness_starts_at_home_on_top_quality_army_installations)t[.
Since the 1970s, the military has expanded social and economic benefits
and services to all ranks and created vast new programs such as child
care and family support services. [Dozens of social welfare
programs](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/military-benefits-overview.html)
allow military personnel to do the jobs they joined to do, and to do
them well. Even with the wrap-around services the military provides,
military personnel also continue to rely on the civilian welfare state
to fill gaps. Military personnel and their families utilize public
schools, child welfare services, and [food
stamps](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2018/02/14/how-presidents-food-stamp-cuts-would-impact-military-families.html),]{.underline}
to name but a few civilian social welfare programs. The military has not
been able to fulfill its missions -- and will not in the future --
without military and civilian investments in social welfare. [Social
welfare also contributes to the national power of the United
States.]{.underline} Regardless of what one thinks about role of America
in the world today, there is no doubt that [one of the main sources of
its influence has been a healthy, educated, and productive
populace]{.underline}. Critics of welfare argue that the populace would
be better off with a much-diminished welfare state replaced by private
charities, de-regulation, and self-reliance. Indeed, they believe
government welfare programs [diminish the economic productivity and
personal initiative of
Americans](http://thefederalist.com/2015/04/27/dependency-work-incentives-and-the-growing-welfare-state/).
Such a view does not correspond with the historical data on the rise of
the United States to the status of a global power and later a
superpower, however. As historians have documented, the increasing
economic and military might of the United States -- and thus its global
influence -- resulted not from a wildly unregulated free market, but
from the better-regulated, well-distributed capitalism of the
[Progressive and New Deal
state](https://www.amazon.com/America-Great-War-Welfare-State/dp/0195049047),
which, along with the [World War II
regulation](https://www.amazon.com/Warfare-State-World-Americans-Government/dp/019993035X)
and postwar expansions of social welfare like the GI Bill, helped
produce the [healthiest, best-educated generation in U.S. (and world)
history](https://books.google.com/books?id=tS47FVPKATcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+richest+generation&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY4eXK3-LaAhUBh-AKHYRtAfAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=the%20richest%20generation&f=false).
Indeed, one way the United States exerted its global power was through
[exporting its New Deal capitalism
abroad](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674025363). For
their part, my students at **[the U.S. Army War College seemed
intuitively aware of positive relationships between social welfare and
national power.]{.underline}** In my "Theory of War and Strategy"
course, officers adhered to a broad definition of national power. Among
other attributes, they cited key outcomes of social welfare -- a
productive economy, civic vitality, and social equality and opportunity.
Students expressed modesty about the ability to achieve goals through
military force alone and insisted on the inter-connected importance of
political, economic, and social institutions to address matters of
international concern. When we studied the history of the Peloponnesian
War, my students expressed doubts about the long-term viability of the
highly unequal Spartan society that directed all its national resources
to war. And they identified tragedy in the imperial over-reach of
Athens, a city-state whose relative equality and social and cultural
investments ought to have sustained its flourishing role in the larger
Greek world. Similarly, [during an exercise ranking the power of the
world's states, military power never functioned as their sole criterion.
**Education, human development, and resultant economic power topped
their lists.**]{.underline} It's no coincidence that **[eight of the ten
most powerful nations they listed feature [significant social safety
nets](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SAFETYNETSANDTRANSFERS/Resources/281945-1124119303499/SSNPrimerNote25.pdf)]{.underline}**,
as defined by the World Bank. In large, complex 21^st^ century
societies, **[organized social welfare programs contribute to national
power]{.underline}**. Maligning welfare and genuflecting to the military
are staples of today's partisan politics, where politicians stoke the
worst fears and deepest passions of their electoral bases. But for those
who claim to support U.S. national power and military readiness there is
little excuse for reductionist thinking about social welfare programs.
Yes, meaningful discussion must take place about how to make sure
investments in both social welfare and military spending are ethical and
sustainable. But no serious reckoning of national security can falsely
decouple the two. [Pitting military spending against social
welfare]{.underline} might be popular for [some versions of
politics](https://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2018/01/look-congress-2018-agenda-budgets-social-programs-and-maybe-infrastructure;%20http://www.dailyindependent.com/news/get-ready-for-a-congressional-budget-blowout/article_dc207bba-ffb1-11e7-89be-bf5848d5)

### A2 Econ

#### Economic decline doesn't cause war -- stats prove

**Clary 15** Christopher Clary, Ph.D. in Political Science from MIT,
Postdoctoral Fellow, Watson Institute for International Studies, Brown
University, "Economic Stress and International Cooperation: Evidence
from International Rivalries," April 22, 2015,
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2597712

**[Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary
conflict?]{.underline}** Or might downturns encourage austerity and
economizing behavior in foreign policy? **[This paper provides new
evidence that economic stress is associated with conciliatory policies
between strategic rivals.]{.underline}** For states that view each other
as military threats, the biggest step possible toward bilateral
cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking political steps to
manage the competition. **[Drawing on data from 109 distinct rival dyads
since 1950, 67 of which terminated, the evidence suggests rivalries were
approximately twice as likely to terminate during economic
downturns]{.underline}** than they were during periods of economic
normalcy. **[This is true controlling for all of the main alternative
explanations for peaceful relations between foes]{.underline}**
(democratic status, nuclear weapons possession, capability imbalance,
common enemies, and international **[systemic changes),]{.underline}**
**[as well as many other possible confounding variables.
This]{.underline}** research **[questions existing
theories]{.underline}** **[claiming]{.underline}** that **[economic
downturns are associated with diversionary war, and instead
argues]{.underline}** that in certain circumstances **[peace may result
from economic troubles]{.underline}**.

#### No econ impact 

**Walt 20** \[Stephen M. Walt is the Robert and Renée Belfer professor
of international relations at Harvard University. "Will a Global
Depression Trigger Another World War?", May 13^th^,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/\]

On balance, however, **[I do not think that even the extraordinary
economic conditions we are witnessing today are going to have much
impact on the likelihood of war.]{.underline}** Why? First of all, **[if
depressions were a powerful cause of war, there would be a lot more of
the latter.]{.underline}** To take one example, **[the United States has
suffered 40 or more recessions since the country was founded, yet it has
fought perhaps 20 interstate wars, most of them unrelated to the state
of the economy]{.underline}**. To paraphrase the economist Paul
Samuelson's famous quip about the stock market, **[if recessions were a
powerful cause of war, they would have predicted "nine out of the last
five]{.underline}** (or fewer)."

Second, **[states do not start wars unless they believe they will win a
quick and relatively cheap victory]{.underline}**. As John Mearsheimer
showed in his classic book Conventional Deterrence, **[national leaders
avoid war when they are convinced it will be long, bloody, costly, and
uncertain. To choose war, political leaders have to convince themselves
they can either win a quick, cheap, and decisive victory or achieve some
limited objective at low cost]{.underline}**. Europe went to war in 1914
with each side believing it would win a rapid and easy victory, and Nazi
Germany developed the strategy of blitzkrieg in order to subdue its foes
as quickly and cheaply as possible. Iraq attacked Iran in 1980 because
Saddam believed the Islamic Republic was in disarray and would be easy
to defeat, and George W. Bush invaded Iraq in 2003 convinced the war
would be short, successful, and pay for itself.

The fact that each of these leaders miscalculated badly does not alter
the main point: **[No matter what a country's economic condition might
be, its leaders will not go to war unless they think they can do so
quickly, cheaply, and with a reasonable probability of
success]{.underline}**.

Third, and most important, **[the primary motivation for most wars is
the desire for security, not economic gain.]{.underline}** For this
reason, **[the odds of war increase when states believe the long-term
balance of power may be shifting against them, when they are convinced
that adversaries are unalterably hostile and cannot be accommodated, and
when they are confident they can reverse the unfavorable trends and
establish a secure position if they act now]{.underline}**. The
historian A.J.P. Taylor once observed that "every war between Great
Powers \[between 1848 and 1918\] ... started as a preventive war, not as
a war of conquest," and that remains true of most wars fought since
then.

**[The bottom line: Economic conditions]{.underline}** (i.e., a
depression) **[may affect the broader political environment in which
decisions for war or peace are made, but they are only one factor among
many and rarely the most significant]{.underline}**. **[Even if the
COVID-19 pandemic has large, lasting, and negative effects on the world
economy---as seems quite likely---it is not likely to affect the
probability of war very much,]{.underline}** especially in the short
term.

fiscal policy**.]{.underline} They have full control of the executive
and legislative branches, but instead of using their power to promote
Reaganomics, it looks like we're getting a reincarnation of the
big‐​government Bush years. As Yogi Berra might have said, "it's déjà vu
all over again." Let's look at the evidence. According to The Hill, the
Keynesian virus has infected GOP thinking on tax cuts. [Republicans are
debating whether parts of their tax‐​reform package should be retroactive
in order to boost the economy by quickly putting more money in people's
wallets. **That is nonsense**.]{.underline} Just as giving people a
check and calling it "stimulus" didn't help the economy under Obama,
giving people a check and calling it a tax cut won't help the economy
under Trump. [**Tax cuts** boost growth when they reduce the marginal
tax rate on productive behavior such as work, saving, investment, or
entrepreneurship. When that happens, people have an incentive to
generate more income. And that leads to more national income, a.k.a.,
economic growth. Borrowing money from the economy's left pocket and then
stuffing check]{.underline}s (oops, I mean retroactive tax cuts) [in the
economy's right pocket, by contrast, **simply reallocates national
income**]{.underline}. Indeed, this is one of the reasons why **[the
economy didn't get much benefit from the 2001 Bush tax
cut]{.underline}**, especially when compared to the growth‐​oriented 2003
tax cut. Unfortunately, Republicans haven't learned that lesson.
Republicans have taken steps in the past to ensure that taxpayers
directly felt the benefits of tax cuts. As part of the 2001 tax cuts
enacted by President George W. Bush, taxpayers received rebate checks.
The article does include some analysis from people who understand that
retroactive tax cuts aren't economically beneficial. ...there are also
drawbacks to making tax changes retroactive. ...such changes would add
to the cost of the bill, but would not be an effective way to encourage
new spending and investments. "It has all of the costs of the tax cuts
but none of the economic benefits," said Committee for a Responsible
Federal Budget President Maya MacGuineas, who added that "you don't make
investments in the rear‐​view mirror." I'm not always on the same side as
Maya, but she's right on this issue. **[You can't encourage people to
generate more income in the past. If you want more growth, you have to
reduce marginal tax rates on future activity.]{.underline}** By the way,
I'm not arguing that there is no political benefit to retroactive tax
cuts. If Republicans simply stated that they were going to send rebate
checks to curry favor with voters, I'd roll my eyes and shrug my
shoulders. But when they make Keynesian arguments to justify such a
policy, I can't help but get upset about the economic illiteracy.
Speaking of bad economic policy, **[GOPers also are pursuing bad
spending policy.]{.underline}** Politico has a report on a potential
budget deal where everyone wins...except taxpayers. The White House is
pushing a deal on Capitol Hill to head off a government shutdown that
would lift strict spending caps long opposed by Democrats in exchange
for money for President Donald Trump's border wall with Mexico, multiple
sources said. So much for Trump's promise to get tough on the budget,
even if it meant a shutdown. Instead, the back‐​room negotiations are
leading to more spending for all interest groups. Marc Short, the White
House's director of legislative affairs, ...also lobbied for a big
budget increase for the Pentagon, another priority for Trump. ...**[The
White House is offering Democrats more funding for their own pet
projects.]{.underline}** The only good news is that Democrats are so
upset about the symbolism of the fence that they may not go for the
deal. Democrats show no sign of yielding on the issue. They have already
blocked the project once. Unfortunately, I expect this is just
posturing. **[When the dust settles, I expect the desire for more
spending (from both parties) will produce a deal that is bad news. At
least for those of us who don't want America to become Greece (any
faster than already scheduled).]{.underline}** Republican and Democratic
congressional aides have predicted for months that both sides will come
together on a spending agreement to raise spending caps for the Pentagon
as well as for nondefense domestic programs. So let's check our
scorecard. On the tax side of the equation, we'll hopefully still get
some good policy, such as a lower corporate tax rate, but it probably
will be accompanied by some gimmicky Keynesian policy. On the spending
side of the equation, it appears my fears about Trump may have been
correct and he's going to be a typical big‐​government Republican. It's
possible, of course, that I'm being needlessly pessimistic and we'll get
the kinds of policies I fantasized about in early 2016. But I wouldn't
bet money on a positive outcome.

majority in Congress might handle Biden in 2023
https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/18/gop-majority-congress-biden-2023-527117\]
6-26-2022

**[Republicans are feeling so good about]{.underline}** their chances of
**[retaking Congress]{.underline}** this fall that **[they're already
debating their governing relationship with]{.underline}** President Joe
**[Biden.]{.underline}** And they're divided over how to handle their
potential big wins. With Biden and Democrats floundering right now, the
GOP is increasingly favored to vault back to partial power in Washington
by flipping the House, and potentially also the Senate, in the coming
midterms. What comes next isn't quite clear: Some Republicans are
mulling ways to collaborate with Biden on issues like trade, energy or
tech; others are prepared to go scorched-earth as their party eyes the
bigger prize of retaking the White House in 2024. **[The]{.underline}**
GOP's **[pro-bipartisanship camp may not have a lot of space in 2023 to
work with the president: funding the government and raising the debt
ceiling will be a major challenge,]{.underline}** given how often House
and Senate Republicans diverge on critical pieces of legislation. And
former President Donald Trump will continue trying to influence the
party's direction, criticizing Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell and
anyone else who steps out of line with his combative politics. Given
those dynamics, there's no unified GOP agenda for voters to examine this
fall --- other than an up-or-down vote on Biden and congressional
Democrats' record. Republicans aren't sure what will happen next if they
actually win. "It's really going to be a referendum on him and his
administration and on the Democrat leadership in the Congress," John
Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican who is also running for reelection
this fall, said of Biden. "So we need to stay out of our own way." "It's
really important for us to highlight our differences, how we would do it
differently," the South Dakotan added. "And then ... have some things
that we would do or could do if there was a willingness to work
together." House GOP plots to keep advantage for 2022 midterms For now
it's Democrats, holding shaky but singular power in Washington,
consuming the Capitol's oxygen as they struggle to enact Biden's agenda.
But the GOP's splits over whether to work with Biden, even now from the
minority, would become the nation's central political story if it
retakes part or all of Congress this fall. With that victory would come
the messy job of actually governing, preventing credit defaults and
government shutdowns at a minimum. And just as a trio of conservative
senators once battled former President Barack Obama on all fronts as
they sought the White House, there's a stable of Senate and House
Republicans with national political ambitions that could cut against any
attempts to collaborate with Biden. Not to mention the passel of
**[Republicans]{.underline}** disinterested in the presidency **[who are
already signaling they'll push to block Biden at every turn. "Putting a
stop to his agenda is the first thing that we would do, because that's
presumably what people would be voting for," said Sen.]{.underline}**
Josh **[Hawley]{.underline}** (R-Mo.), a potential 2024 GOP White House
hopeful who led the objections to Biden's election certification.
"**[The message would be: If we're in the majority, we need to stop what
he's currently doing."]{.underline}** Still, the most powerful Senate
Republican has indicated an openness to work with Biden. Already feeling
bullish on his party's chances this fall, McConnell said in a
late-September interview: "I don't think people send us here to do
nothing." "When you have a closely divided government, or a divided
government," McConnell added then in previously unreported comments, "I
think the American people are saying, 'We know you have some big
differences, and either of you may not be able to move the ball the way
you'd like to. But why don't you look for things you agree on, and do
those?'" McConnell pointed to trade as a potential area of future
cooperation with Biden. As Senate majority leader during the last two
years of Obama's administration, McConnell famously blocked the
president from filling a Supreme Court vacancy and slowed other judicial
confirmations to a trickle. McConnell won't say how he'd handle a
Supreme Court vacancy if one comes up in 2023 or 2024 and he controls
the Senate, though Democrats are positive he wouldn't fill one for Biden
either. Yet McConnell also cut a deal with Obama to fast-track new trade
deals that then-Democratic leader Harry Reid did not lend a hand with.
McConnell later clinched a bipartisan transportation deal with Obama and
Democrats. As minority leader during this Congress, McConnell signed off
on a huge Biden-backed infrastructure bill and after repeated threats
that he would do otherwise, allowed the debt ceiling to increase. House
Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Republicans opposed those
accommodations by the Kentucky Republican --- as did Trump. And unlike
McConnell, McCarthy and his conference are in the thrall of the party's
former president. That means **[the House Freedom Caucus and other
allies of the former president will be trying to maximize Democrats'
losses even at the expense of legislation some rank-and-file Republicans
would otherwise support]{.underline}**, particularly in the Senate. When
asked about areas House Republicans could team up on with the Biden
administration, Georgia Rep. Drew Ferguson, a member of GOP leadership,
replied tersely: "On anything that's not socialist." That public
posturing reflects a real concern among some Republicans that Biden
might not be willing to pivot from his current agenda of expanding
social and climate programs, and gutting the filibuster to pass
elections reform, in order to work with Republicans on what would
probably be small-bore issues. With a bipartisan infrastructure package
already law, there's fewer obvious opportunities for collaboration with
the other party at the moment. Rep. John Curtis (R-Utah) suggested
immigration as an avenue for partnership. House Minority Whip Steve
Scalise (R-La.) wants to work with Biden on battling inflation. Sen.
Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said Republicans could talk to Biden about
making Social Security "more sustainable." But **[it's hard to imagine a
split government delivering on even one]{.underline}** of those
**[big-ticket item]{.underline}**s. And some **[Republicans are already
downplaying any ideological intersection with Biden after the past year.
"Are we going to get the president that was a self proclaimed dealmaker
in the Senate for his entire career?]{.underline}** Are we going to get
the guy that's down in Georgia \[for\] a face-saving speech to his base
because he can't get something through the Senate?" asked Rep. Kelly
Armstrong (R-N.D.). "A lot of it depends on which president we get."
Indeed, Armstrong and other Republicans singled out the tone of Biden's
speech in Georgia last week, in which the president suggested that
lawmakers who oppose Democrats' voting rights legislation will be on the
same side of history as segregationists and the head of the Confederacy.
McConnell quickly condemned Biden's remarks, calling them "beneath his
office," and Biden later sought to clarify that he hadn't made that
direct comparison about the GOP leader. One telling metric: Even
Republicans who voted to impeach Trump last year aren't sure whether
they can find any substantive common ground with Biden if they are in
the majority. "Boy, **[my answer would have been a lot different a year
ago," said]{.underline}** freshman **[Rep]{.underline}**. Peter
**[Meijer]{.underline}** (R-Mich.), who voted to impeach Donald Trump
earlier this year. **["I've been astounded at the number of areas where
we'll talk with people from the administration. ... And then just
nothing happens."]{.underline}**

#### Dems holding onto the Senate, staying close to 50 Senators enough to prevent change in agenda

Wrong Question"; Newsweek; 5.24.22;

If it\'s the usual one---\"**[Will Republicans take over majorities in
Congress?]{.underline}**\"---then sure, there\'s a lot of evidence to
say **[yes]{.underline}**, they will. But that\'s not a very profound
insight, is it? The President\'s party has almost always bled seats in
midterms, and this year, even a handful of losses will mean a Republican
majority. Even Presidents with soaring approval ratings still lose an
average of three House seats in midterm elections, and we all know that
President Biden\'s approval is 11 points below his disapproval.
Reflecting the Democrats\' unpopularity more widely, the \"generic
ballot\" polling question has the Democrats down 2.5 percent. But what

we should be asking as we close in on November\'s midterms. **[Can the
Democrats keep things close?]{.underline}** Instead of asking whether
the Democrats are going to lose their majority---a question we can all
agree is best answered with a yes---I\'d argue that we should be asking
whether the Democrats can keep things close. If you\'re thinking that
\"close\" only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, think again:

IMAGES NEWSWEEK SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS \> For one thing, **[if Democrats
can hold just the Senate, they retain critical levers of power that are
currently making a real difference]{.underline}**. Consider the fact
that President Biden has been getting his nominees for federal judges
confirmed at a record pace, offsetting some of President Trump\'s
massive reshaping of the judiciary. **[The Democratic-led Senate has
successfully confirmed 369 of 521 nominees for key agency positions so
far, and given congressional gridlock, these are the people shaping most
of what is happening in government.]{.underline}** As just one example,
note that the Trump Administration rolled back 112 environmental rules,
30 of them on emissions. Now, Biden\'s agencies are overturning those
changes, including critical rules on fuel standards, gas pipelines, and
methane emissions. They need the leadership in place to keep that going.
But **[even if Democrats lose the Senate, keeping the margins narrow
means having to take out fewer Republican office-holders in
2024.]{.underline}** That matters because incumbents usually start off
with about a three-point election advantage. Moreover, consider the fact
that **[slim House majorities are much harder to manage than fat
ones]{.underline}**. Just look at Nancy Pelosi\'s recent headaches; the
most vulnerable representatives are always on the hot seat. A big
majority allows those swing seat members to go against their party on
the toughest votes and look bipartisan. Without that shield, the biggest
targets are exposed. The good news for Democrats is that the chances of
limiting their losses are actually fairly high. Modeling from
highly-regarded analyst Alan Abramowitz suggests that Democrats
currently have an even shot to hold the Senate and are on track to lose
only about 20 House seats. It\'s not great, but it\'s within striking
distance, and would be hardly a \"shellacking.\" But there\'s a second
and even better question we should be asking, and it\'s this: **[Can
Democrats win enough races to protect American democracy from
disaster?]{.underline}** America is likely facing an existential crisis
in 2024 from Big Lie MAGAists planning to subvert elections to reinstate
Donald Trump or a near clone. Bill Clinton once said that our priority
was to \"save Social Security first.\" Today, the mantra has to be
\"save democracy first.\" Can Democrats accomplish that?
**[Yes]{.underline}**. Step one is to limit their 2022 losses for the
reasons noted above, and also because if they can stay positioned to win
back enough seats in 2024, it lowers the chances that Republicans can
pull another Eastman Memo maneuver, muck with the electoral count, and
have the election decided by cronies in the House. Second, Democrats
must focus on keeping the Big Lie cabal from winning strategically
important offices and legislative majorities in swing states. Closely
divided bodies that could flip in 2022 include chambers in Arizona,
Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Secretaries of State will be at the
epicenter of the assault on elections, so Democrats must hold offices
like Michigan and flip offices in states like Arizona, Georgia, and
Nevada. Just to give a sense of the stakes, in Colorado the Democratic
Secretary of State, a person who has received countless death threats,
is up against a Republican county clerk facing criminal charges for
tampering with voting equipment and who a judge barred from overseeing
elections. In Pennsylvania, the Republican nominee for governor is a
leading voice in the election denial movement and gets to pick the
Secretary of State. Democrats must win as many of these critical races
as possible. And is that do-able? Yes. Posing the right question means
focusing on what you really care about. Democratic doomscrolling of the
midterm election is understandable---it has the same appeal as watching
the Johnny Depp trial---but what has to matter most is making sure there
are still elections to care about in the future, to say nothing of the
broader aim the party is supposed to stand for: an inclusive and
ever-expanding vision of opportunity. Those are the real goals. And yes,
Democrats can still achieve them, even if they lose in the midterms.
**[Of course, the Democrats could still turn this around completely:
There are historical outliers where the President\'s party held serve,
and plenty of times where Republicans nominated such extreme candidates
that they lost winnable races.]{.underline}** But in general, the basic
positioning of the parties tends to hold in the runup to an election,
while jolts to the race tend to work against the party that holds the
White House. Which is why Democrats should be focused on the achievable
goals that are very much in reach.

"An Earth Day Reminder of How the Republicans Have Forsaken the
Environment ," April 22, 2022,
https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/an-earth-day-reminder-of-how-the-republicans-have-forsaken-the-environment

The idea for Earth Day came to Gaylord Nelson all of a sudden one day in
the middle of 1969. That summer, "teach-ins" about the Vietnam War were
all the rage. It occurred to Nelson, then the junior U.S. senator from
Wisconsin: How about a "teach-in" about the environment? To attract the
widest possible audience, Nelson, a Democrat, invited Representative
Pete McCloskey, a Republican from California, to co-chair the event. The
response was way more enthusiastic than either man had anticipated: on
April 22, 1970, some twenty million Americans---a tenth of the country's
population---took to the streets. It was the largest public
demonstration in U.S. history, and, as Jamie Henn, one of the founders
of 350.org, has put it, it "had bite." By the end of the year, a
Republican President, Richard Nixon, had created the Environmental
Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. This was followed in relatively short order by the
passage of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered
Species Act. All of these measures were approved with overwhelming
bipartisan support. Today, as Earth Day turns fifty, it's hard to
imagine more dolorous circumstances for the occasion. covid-19 has
forced online (or cancelled) virtually all the celebrations and protests
that had been planned for the anniversary[. The Trump
Administration]{.underline} has barely even taken the day off from
gutting the nation's environmental regulations. (Last week, the
Administration [weakened rules governing the emission of mercury and
other toxic chemicals from power plants]{.underline}; late last month[,
it weakened fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks.)
Meanwhile, in Congress, environmental protection has become]{.underline}
such [a thoroughly partisan issue]{.underline} that across-the-aisle
collaborations like Nelson and McCloskey's are rarer than Amur leopards.
[Owing to this divide, **environmental problems** that have emerged
since 1970 **have** simply **gone unaddressed**]{.underline}. Congress
has not passed---or even really come close to passing---a single piece
of legislation aimed at addressing climate change. (All the steps taken
by the Obama Administration to try to curb carbon emissions were done
through regulation.) Precisely at the "moment when such legislative
action is most needed," James Morton Turner, a professor at Wellesley
College, and Andrew Isenberg, a professor at the University of Kansas,
have written, it has become "almost politically unimaginable." How and
why this happened is the subject of Turner and Isenberg's recent book,
"The Republican Reversal: Conservatives and the Environment from Nixon
to Trump." The two trace the G.O.P.'s turn against conservation to
Ronald Reagan, who equated environmentalism with pessimism, and
pessimism with a lack of patriotism. [Reagan]{.underline} combined a
sunny faith in the future with an equally sunny indifference to facts.
Running for President in 1980, he [claimed that acid rain was not caused
by power-plant and auto emissions, as scientists had shown, but by the
eruption of Mt. St. Helens]{.underline}, in Washington State, earlier
that year. Also during the campaign, he declared that "eighty per cent
of our air pollution stems from hydrocarbons released by vegetation."
Once elected, Reagan appointed Anne Gorsuch---an inexperienced ideologue
(and the mother of the future Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch)---to
head the E.P.A. Among her first moves was to propose slashing the
agency's budget by more than forty per cent. One staffer complained that
morale was so low there was "no known scientific method to measure it."
Since Reagan, control of the White House has, of course, swung between
the parties, as has control of Congress. Throughout the swings,
[anti-environmentalism has only become that much more entrenched in
G.O.P. politics]{.underline}. (McCloskey, it's worth noting, switched
his party affiliation from Republican to Democrat, in 2007, at the age
of seventy-nine.) A great deal of money has changed hands to help change
minds; according to the Web site Open Secrets, which tracks federal
campaign contributions[, the oil-and-gas industry contributed nearly
twenty-four million dollars to House and Senate Republicans]{.underline}
during the past election cycle, [compared with five million to
Democrats]{.underline}. But, according to Turner and Isenberg, money is
only part of the equation; the other part is votes. [For
Republican]{.underline} [politicians, there's **no incentive
to**,]{.underline} say[, **back legislation to limit climate
change**]{.underline}: "Neither their corporate donors nor evangelicals
nor the struggling Rust Belt workers who voted for Trump in 2016 see any
advantage to it." The situation is such that, as Aaron Huertas, who
works with WeCanVote.US, recently pointed out, were Democrats inclined
to pass meaningful climate legislation, they'd need to win not just the
Presidency this fall but also a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.
Can this situation be changed? Certainly the hour is late and the
facts---if you happen to be concerned about such things---are stark.
What the original Earth Day showed is that, when Americans are
mobilized, remarkable things are possible. What the past few years have
shown is that Americans can be mobilized by the most remarkable
falsehoods. To say that the future of the world depends on which of
these tendencies prevails is at this point, unfortunately, no
exaggeration.

#### Warming leads to extinction

**Kareiva 18**, Ph.D. in ecology and applied mathematics from Cornell
University, director of the Institute of the Environment and
Sustainability at UCLA, Pritzker Distinguished Professor in Environment
& Sustainability at UCLA, et al. (Peter, "Existential risk due to
ecosystem collapse: Nature strikes back," *Futures*, 102)

In summary, six of the nine proposed planetary boundaries (phosphorous,
nitrogen, biodiversity, land use, atmospheric aerosol loading, and
chemical pollution) are unlikely to be associated with existential
risks. They all correspond to a degraded environment, but in our
assessment do not represent existential risks. However, the three
remaining boundaries (**[climate change, global freshwater cycle, and
ocean acidification]{.underline}**) do **[pose existential
risks]{.underline}**. **[This is because of intrinsic positive feedback
loops]{.underline}**, substantial lag times between system change and
experiencing the consequences of that change, **[and the fact these
different boundaries interact with one another in ways that yield
surprises]{.underline}**. In addition, **[climate, freshwater, and ocean
acidification are all directly connected to the provision of food and
water, and shortages]{.underline}** of food and water can **[create
conflict and social unrest]{.underline}**. Climate change has a long
history of disrupting civilizations and sometimes precipitating the
collapse of cultures or mass emigrations (McMichael, 2017). For example,
the 12th century drought in the North American Southwest is held
responsible for the collapse of the Anasazi pueblo culture. More
recently, the infamous potato famine of 1846--1849 and the large
migration of Irish to the U.S. can be traced to a combination of
factors, one of which was climate. Specifically, 1846 was an unusually
warm and moist year in Ireland, providing the climatic conditions
favorable to the fungus that caused the potato blight. As is so often
the case, poor government had a role as well---as the British government
forbade the import of grains from outside Britain (imports that could
have helped to redress the ravaged potato yields). **[Climate change
intersects with freshwater resources because it is expected to
exacerbate drought and]{.underline}** **[water scarcity,]{.underline}**
as well as flooding. Climate change can even impair water quality
because it is associated with heavy rains that overwhelm sewage
treatment facilities, or because it results in higher concentrations of
pollutants in groundwater as a result of enhanced evaporation and
reduced groundwater recharge. **[Ample clean water]{.underline}** is not
a luxury---it **[is essential for human survival.]{.underline}**
Consequently, cities, regions and nations that lack clean freshwater are
vulnerable to social disruption and disease. Finally, ocean
acidification is linked to climate change because it is driven by CO2
emissions just as global warming is. With close to 20% of the world's
protein coming from oceans (FAO, 2016), the potential for severe impacts
due to acidification is obvious. Less obvious, but perhaps more
insidious, is the interaction between climate change and the loss of
oyster and coral reefs due to acidification. Acidification is known to
interfere with oyster reef building and coral reefs. **[Climate change
also increases storm frequency and severity. Coral reefs and oyster
reefs provide protection from storm surge because they reduce wave
energy]{.underline}** (Spalding et al., 2014). **[If these reefs are
lost due to acidification at the same time as storms become more severe
and sea level rises]{.underline}**, **[coastal communities will be
exposed to unprecedented storm surge]{.underline}**---**[and may be
ravaged by recurrent storms]{.underline}**. A key feature of the risk
associated with climate change is that mean annual temperature and mean
annual rainfall are not the variables of interest. Rather it is extreme
episodic events that place nations and entire regions of the world at
risk. These extreme events are by definition "rare" (once every hundred
years), and changes in their likelihood are challenging to detect
because of their rarity, but are exactly the manifestations of climate
change that we must get better at anticipating (Diffenbaugh et al.,
2017). **[Society will have a hard time responding to shorter intervals
between rare extreme events]{.underline}** because in the lifespan of an
individual human, a person might experience as few as two or three
extreme events. How likely is it that you would notice a change in the
interval between events that are separated by decades, especially given
that the interval is not regular but varies stochastically? A concrete
example of this dilemma can be found in the past and expected future
changes in storm-related flooding of New York City. The highly
disruptive flooding of New York City associated with Hurricane Sandy
represented a flood height that occurred once every 500 years in the
18th century, and that occurs now once **[every 25 years, but is
expected to occur once every 5 years by 2050]{.underline}** (Garner et
al., 2017). This change in frequency of extreme floods has profound
implications for the measures New York City should take to protect its
infrastructure and its population, yet because of the stochastic nature
of such events, this shift in flood frequency is an elevated risk that
will go unnoticed by most people. 4. The combination of positive
feedback loops and societal inertia is fertile ground for global
environmental catastrophes **[Humans are remarkably ingenious, and have
adapted to crises throughout their history]{.underline}**. Our doom has
been repeatedly predicted, only to be averted by innovation (Ridley,
2011). **[However, the many stories of human ingenuity successfully
addressing existential risks]{.underline}** such as global famine or
extreme air pollution **[represent environmental challenges that are
largely linear, have immediate consequences, and operate without
positive feedbacks.]{.underline}** For example, the fact that food is in
short supply does not increase the rate at which humans consume
food---thereby increasing the shortage. Similarly, massive air pollution
episodes such as the London fog of 1952 that killed 12,000 people did
not make future air pollution events more likely. In fact it was just
the opposite---the London fog sent such a clear message that Britain
quickly enacted pollution control measures (Stradling, 2016). Food
shortages, air pollution, water pollution, etc. send immediate signals
to society of harm, which then trigger a negative feedback of society
seeking to reduce the harm. In contrast, today's great environmental
crisis of climate change may cause some harm but there are generally
long time delays between rising CO2 concentrations and damage to humans.
The consequence of these delays are an absence of urgency; thus although
70% of Americans believe global warming is happening, only 40% think it
will harm them
(http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/).
Secondly, **[unlike past environmental challenges, the Earth's climate
system is rife with positive feedback loops]{.underline}**. **[In
particular, as CO2 increases and the climate warms, that very warming
can cause more CO2 release which further increases global warming, and
then more CO2, and so on]{.underline}**. Table 2 summarizes the best
documented positive feedback loops for the Earth's climate system. These
feedbacks can be neatly categorized into carbon cycle, biogeochemical,
biogeophysical, cloud, ice-albedo, and water vapor feedbacks. As
important as it is to understand these feedbacks individually, it is
even more essential to study the interactive nature of these feedbacks.
Modeling studies show that when interactions among feedback loops are
included, uncertainty increases dramatically and there is a heightened
potential for perturbations to be magnified (e.g., Cox, Betts, Jones,
Spall, & Totterdell, 2000; Hajima, Tachiiri, Ito, & Kawamiya, 2014;
Knutti & Rugenstein, 2015; Rosenfeld, Sherwood, Wood, & Donner, 2014).
This produces a wide range of future scenarios. Positive feedbacks in
the carbon cycle involves the enhancement of future carbon contributions
to the atmosphere due to some initial increase in atmospheric CO2. This
happens because as CO2 accumulates, it reduces the efficiency in which
oceans and terrestrial ecosystems sequester carbon, which in return
feeds back to exacerbate climate change (Friedlingstein et al., 2001).
Warming can also increase the rate at which organic matter decays and
carbon is released into the atmosphere, thereby causing more warming
(Melillo et al., 2017). Increases in food shortages and lack of water is
also of major concern when biogeophysical feedback mechanisms perpetuate
drought conditions. The underlying mechanism here is that losses in
vegetation increases the surface albedo, which suppresses rainfall, and
thus enhances future vegetation loss and more suppression of
rainfall---thereby initiating or prolonging a drought (Chamey, Stone, &
Quirk, 1975). To top it off, overgrazing depletes the soil, leading to
augmented vegetation loss (Anderies, Janssen, & Walker, 2002). Climate
change often also increases the risk of forest fires, as a result of
higher temperatures and persistent drought conditions. **[The
expectation is that forest fires will become more frequent and severe
with climate warming and drought]{.underline}** (Scholze, Knorr, Arnell,
& Prentice, 2006), a trend for which we have already seen evidence
(Allen et al., 2010). Tragically, the increased severity and risk of
Southern California wildfires recently predicted by climate scientists
(Jin et al., 2015), was realized in December 2017, with the largest fire
in the history of California (the "Thomas fire" that burned 282,000
acres,
https://www.vox.com/2017/12/27/16822180/thomas-fire-california-largest-wildfire).
**[This catastrophic fire embodies the sorts of positive feedbacks and
interacting factors that could catch humanity off-guard]{.underline}**
**[and produce a true apocalyptic event]{.underline}**. Record-breaking
rains produced an extraordinary flush of new vegetation, that then dried
out as record heat waves and dry conditions took hold, coupled with
stronger than normal winds, and ignition. Of course the record-fire
released CO2 into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to future
warming. Out of all types of feedbacks, water vapor and the ice-albedo
feedbacks are the most clearly understood mechanisms. Losses in
reflective snow and ice cover drive up surface temperatures, leading to
even more melting of snow and ice cover---this is known as the
ice-albedo feedback (Curry, Schramm, & Ebert, 1995). As snow and ice
continue to melt at a more rapid pace, millions of people may be
displaced by flooding risks as a consequence of sea level rise near
coastal communities (Biermann & Boas, 2010; Myers, 2002; Nicholls et
al., 2011). The water vapor feedback operates when warmer atmospheric
conditions strengthen the saturation vapor pressure, which creates a
warming effect given water vapor's strong greenhouse gas properties
(Manabe & Wetherald, 1967). Global warming tends to increase cloud
formation because warmer temperatures lead to more evaporation of water
into the atmosphere, and warmer temperature also allows the atmosphere
to hold more water. The key question is whether this increase in clouds
associated with global warming will result in a positive feedback loop
(more warming) or a negative feedback loop (less warming). For decades,
scientists have sought to answer this question and understand the net
role clouds play in future climate projections (Schneider et al., 2017).
Clouds are complex because they both have a cooling (reflecting incoming
solar radiation) and warming (absorbing incoming solar radiation) effect
(Lashof, DeAngelo, Saleska, & Harte, 1997). The type of cloud, altitude,
and optical properties combine to determine how these countervailing
effects balance out. Although still under debate, it appears that in
most circumstances the cloud feedback is likely positive (Boucher et
al., 2013). For example, models and observations show that increasing
greenhouse gas concentrations reduces the low-level cloud fraction in
the Northeast Pacific at decadal time scales. This then has a positive
feedback effect and enhances climate warming since less solar radiation
is reflected by the atmosphere (Clement, Burgman, & Norris, 2009).
**[The key lesson from the long list of potentially positive feedbacks
and their interactions is that]{.underline}** **[runaway climate change,
and runaway perturbations have to be taken as a serious
possibility]{.underline}**. Table 2 is just a snapshot of the type of
feedbacks that have been identified (see Supplementary material for a
more thorough explanation of positive feedback loops). However, **[this
list is not exhaustive and the possibility of undiscovered positive
feedbacks portends even greater existential risks]{.underline}**. The
many environmental crises humankind has previously averted (famine,
ozone depletion, London fog, water pollution, etc.) were averted because
of political will based on solid scientific understanding. We cannot
count on complete scientific understanding when it comes to positive
feedback loops and climate change.

### Dems good -- laundry list

#### Democrats win is good -- federal judges, GOP agenda, investigations, 2024 Senate

**Zhouli 22** \[Li Zhouli. \"Why a Democratic Senate majority still
matters ⁠--- even if they lose the House\". 5-2-2022. Vox.

-- AL

If Democrats lose the House this fall, as they're widely expected to,
their ability to do ambitious bills will be all but moot. Given
Republican opposition, it's likely most legislation, barring must-pass
measures like appropriations, will be dead on arrival. That prompts the
question: Does it matter if they lose the Senate, too? In fact, holding
their majority in the upper chamber is still extremely important for a
number of reasons, perhaps none more so than the courts. If elected, a
Democratic Senate would be able to confirm more of President Joe Biden's
judicial nominees, including any upcoming theoretical Supreme Court
pick. Even without the House, they could approve judges for district
courts, circuit courts, and the high court with a simple Senate
majority. And that's not the only benefit: Keeping this majority would
also mean that lawmakers could set their own floor agenda and reject
bills approved by a GOP-led House. Senate Democrats could ensure, too,
that hearings and committee time aren't used on investigations of Biden
and other members of his administration. "Given that it will be
investigations on steroids over in the House, the question is how the
Senate could serve as a buffer," says Democratic strategist Jim Manley,
a former staffer for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Securing
that buffer won't be easy as the prospects for Democrats this fall are
looking increasingly grim. Due to the backlash the president's party
typically faces, and other factors like the country's ongoing struggles
with inflation, Democrats are likely to see some major losses in the
House and have no room for error in the Senate. Because of the 2022
Senate map and candidates' past patterns of bucking national trends,
however, Democrats have a slightly better chance of sustaining their
narrow hold on the upper chamber. Three reasons Senate control matters
**[Democrats would be pretty limited legislatively under divided
government --- but there are still]{.underline}** three **[key areas
where Senate control matters. Judges]{.underline}** "**[The main
difference between a split Congress and one controlled by Republicans
completely would be Biden's ability to fill judicial and other
vacancies]{.underline}**," says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's
Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia. **[A GOP Senate majority
would be able to vote down Biden's judicial nominees]{.underline}**
(including any that come up on the Supreme Court), block them wholesale
from consideration, and pressure the White House to pick what they
perceive as more moderate options. Republican lawmakers have already
signaled that they may not consider Biden's nominees. In April, Senate
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn't commit to giving a Supreme
Court pick a hearing in 2023 if the Republicans retook their majority.
It's something he's done before: During the Obama administration,
McConnell notably blocked Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland from
ever getting a hearing by arguing that his nomination was in an election
year. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has said that the "Garland rule" could
be used if a high court vacancy comes up in 2024. **[Such opposition
could seriously stymie Biden's efforts on the courts]{.underline}**: In
his first year, Biden appointed the most federal judges of any president
since Ronald Reagan, including more women, more people of color, and
more public defenders than his predecessors. **[His attempts to continue
doing so would be severely constrained without a Democratic Senate
majority.]{.underline}** Since these judges have lifetime appointments,
their appointments have long-term impacts that extend far beyond the
administration that nominated them. Trump and a Republican-controlled
Senate confirmed more than 200 judges during his presidency, many of
whom have contributed to pivotal decisions on immigration policy, mask
mandates, and abortion rights. **[Setting legislative
priorities]{.underline}** In the majority, Democrats would be able to
set the floor schedule and ignore bills that Republicans send over from
the House. "**[It's crucial to keep the Senate if only to serve as a
bulwark against every bad idea that House Republicans]{.underline}** are
going to **[think of]{.underline}** when they try to send them over to
the Senate," said Manley. **[If Republicans had Senate control, any
bills that passed both chambers could still be vetoed by Biden. In the
process, however, they could force vulnerable Democrats to take
difficult votes on contentious issues.]{.underline}** Similarly,
Republicans could use tools like the Congressional Review Act and budget
resolutions for messaging votes. Using the CRA, lawmakers could try to
undo rules recently imposed by the Biden administration. If a simple
majority in both chambers disapproves of a rule, they can pass a
resolution trying to repeal it. Biden could also veto this, but
Democrats would be pushed to take tough votes on the administration's
policies in the interim. Budget resolutions also only require a simple
majority to pass the Senate and could be another forum for Republicans
to score political points. Using these resolutions, which are also
subject to a presidential veto, they could approve changes to the tax
code or spending on climate programs and reproductive health.
**[Investigations]{.underline}** Republicans have already vowed to serve
as a check on the Biden administration once they retake the majority in
either chamber. House Republicans, for example, have announced plans to
investigate the business practices of the president's son Hunter Biden,
and even pursue impeachment of certain Cabinet members. "Immediately,
the House Republicans are going to start investigating the White House
and the administration, basically looking for anything to embarrass the
administration as much as they can," says Neilan Chaturvedi, a political
science professor at Cal Poly Pomona. While a GOP-controlled House would
be able to dedicate time and resources to these efforts, **[a
Democrat-controlled Senate could make sure that their chamber's
committees didn't focus hearings on these issues]{.underline}**.
Additionally, the Senate could attempt to avoid a trial if the House
approves articles of impeachment for an administration official. "The
House could go ahead and vote to impeach, but there is some ambiguity
about whether or not the Senate is compelled to hold a trial," said
George Washington University political science professor Sarah Binder.
**[Democrats' 2022 wins could decide control of the Senate for years
Democratic wins this cycle would cushion potential losses the party
could experience in the next election]{.underline}**. Since senators
hold six-year terms, anyone elected in 2022 would play a major role in
preserving the party's numbers for Congressional terms to come. "I think
**[it matters more down the line because Democrats are staring at a
really brutal map in 2024]{.underline}**," says Cook Political Report's
Jessica Taylor. As Vox's Andrew Prokop has explained, Democrats aren't
currently defending any seats in states that Trump took in 2020. The
four most contentious Democratic seats that are up --- Nevada, Georgia,
New Hampshire, and Arizona --- are all places Biden won. Two other swing
seats currently held by Republicans --- Pennsylvania and Wisconsin ---
are also places Biden previously won, putting them in Democrats'
potential reach. The 2024 map, however, is far more challenging. That
year, Democrats will be defending Sen. Joe Manchin's seat in West
Virginia, Sen. Jon Tester's seat in Montana, and Sen. Sherrod Brown's
seat in Ohio, all states that voted for Trump in the last election.
Additionally, several other Democrat-held seats will be up in states
like Arizona, Michigan, and Maine. Essentially, the more seats Democrats
can win in 2022, the better position they'll have to withstand any
shake-ups two years from now.

Despite everything you've heard, [there are]{.underline} still [plenty
of reasons Democrats could do much better in November's midterm
elections than Republicans]{.underline} and much of the media expect. In
fact, the future of American democracy depends on it. Democrats
certainly know in normal election years a new president's party
historically loses congressional seats in the first midterms because
opponents angry over losing power are more motivated than the winners to
vote in low-turnout midterms. But every American also should realize
there will never be another normal election year in this country until
Republicans free themselves from the control of their defeated president
and the violent militias and hate groups that support him who refuse to
accept the results of free and fair elections. [Rather than distancing
themselves from their divisive, unpopular president]{.underline} who was
thrown out of office after a single term by the largest voter turnout in
history, [Republican leaders]{.underline} who know better [have
joined]{.underline} a lunatic fringe within their party [in supporting
Donald Trump's]{.underline} preposterous [lie President Biden somehow
stole the election]{.underline} by manufacturing millions of fraudulent
votes. Extreme Candidates As a result, Republicans will be saddled with
a lot of extreme candidates in those November midterms they're so
confident of winning. Adding to the chaos will be Trump himself
campaigning for the worst among them who are running against Republicans
he wants to punish for accepting accurate election results or condemning
his supporters' terrorist attack on the Capitol. [Trump is one of the
best agents Democrats have to get out the vote in their
party]{.underline}. [In the past two national elections, Democrats set
new voter turnout records in the 2018 midterms flipping 40 seats to gain
House control and in 2020 defeating Trump]{.underline}. 2022 could make
it three in a row. The absurd Republican candidates in the midterms
include at least five running for House seats who actively participated
in that violent Jan. 6 insurrection. A New Hampshire candidate promises
to run from prison if he's incarcerated for breaking into the Capitol.
[The Ron Johnson Opportunity Wisconsin already provided a prime
opportunity in the midterms for Democrats to increase Senate control by
flipping the seat held by Ron Johnson]{.underline}, a national
embarrassment who's denied the violence of the attack resulting in five
deaths and serious brain injuries to police beaten with iron pipes,
hockey sticks and baseball bats. He's discouraged vaccinations during
the latest surge of a new, highly contagious COVID variant endangering
the lives of the unvaccinated. Johnson could be joined on the midterm
ballot by former Republican Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch running against
Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. Kleefisch enthusiastically supports Trump's
fraudulent election claims and Michael Gableman's corrupt investigation
into Biden's victory in Wisconsin for Assembly Republicans that's
expected to recommend new Wisconsin voting restrictions. All but the
most dimwitted Republican leaders have to realize how dangerous Trump
and his violent supporters are to the future of democracy. But they
believe they need Trump's supporters to win the midterms. They'll worry
about controlling the contempt for democracy in their party later. By
then, they'll be the ones under control. The Good News So here's some
more positive news about how much better the political landscape could
be for Democrats in those fall midterms. The media have been warning us
Republican state legislatures can easily win control of the House of
Representatives with their usual corrupt gerrymandering of congressional
districts in response to the 2020 census. Surprise, it's not happening.
The latest analysis by David Wasserman, redistricting expert for the
non-partisan Cook Political Report, concludes redistricting is on track
to create a congressional map slightly less biased in favor of
Republicans than it's been for the past decade. It should actually add a
few more Biden-won districts. Wisconsin was specifically cited for one
of the biggest ironies. After the racist anti-Obama tea party elections
of 2010, Wisconsin and other Republican states drew such extremely
gerrymandered maps it's difficult for Republicans to make them any
worse. In some Republican states, nonpartisan commissions and courts
also are making a difference. Here's more positive news for Democrats
you haven't heard nearly enough about. Nobel-prize-winning economist and
columnist Paul Krugman described the first year of Biden's presidency as
"a year of spectacular economic recovery." In early November, [a Federal
Reserve survey of economists predicted a year-end unemployment rate of
5.8%. Instead, November's unemployment was 4.2% declining further to
3.9% in December. If supply chain problems keep easing in the coming
year to reduce inflation, Biden's economic success will
continue]{.underline}. Here's more. Not even Joe Manchin or Kyrsten
Sinema want their party to be the minority in the Senate after the
midterms. They'll vote for a substantial new package of Biden's Build
Back Better legislation before long to improve the everyday lives of
ordinary Americans. [Biden and Democrats could go into the midterms in
good shape after another successful year.]{.underline} That would be
very good news for American democracy.

### Non-unique -- Roe

#### Outrage over Roe vs Wade overturn [flips the script]{.underline} on midterms - democrats will win now

WASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - [**Leading Democrats sought to turn
Friday\'s Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade into a rallying
cry for the November elections**, warning of grim consequences for
women, contraception and gay marriage if Republicans regain control of
Congress]{.underline}. In a 5-4 ruling powered by its conservative
majority, the high court overturned the 1973 landmark decision that had
recognized a woman\'s right to an abortion, and had legalized it
nationwide, for nearly half a century. [The decision was greeted as a
stunning victory by anti-abortion Republicans and other conservatives,
while Democrats and abortion-right activists protested what they
described as a step backwards for the rights of American women. But with
control of the House of Representatives and the Senate at stake in the
Nov. 8 midterm elections, Democrats also warned that the rights of women
and others would face further dangers if Republicans regain control of
Congress.]{.underline} \"The Republicans are plotting a nationwide
abortion ban. They cannot be allowed to have a majority in the Congress
to do that,\" said House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the
chamber\'s top Democrat, told reporters. \"It is clear that we just have
to win a majority in November. Everything is at stake,\" added Pelosi, a
Catholic who was barred from taking communion last month by the
archbishop of San Francisco because of her support for abortion rights.
[**About 71% of Americans - including majorities of Democrats and
Republicans - say decisions about terminating a pregnancy should be left
to a woman and her doctor, rather than regulated by the** government,
according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.]{.underline} [Democrats hope **voter
anger about the Supreme Court\'s decision will help them retain their
razor-thin margins of control in the House and Senate**]{.underline}.
With President Joe Biden\'s approval rating slumping, most forecasters
have so far favored Republicans\' chances of winning a majority in at
least the House. \"This fall, Roe is on the ballot. Personal freedoms
are on the ballot. The right to privacy, liberty, equality are all about
it,\" Biden said on Friday. It was not clear how easily Democrats could
use the abortion rights message to mobilize support. Despite having
control of the White House and both chambers of Congress for nearly 18
months, Biden and his Democratic allies have disappointed their core
supporters with repeated failures on hot-button issues including
abortion, voting rights and social spending. Efforts to reform the
Senate filibuster and overcome Republican opposition to the Biden agenda
have been hamstrung by opposition from within their own party,
specifically Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Even
their success at enacting moderate gun-safety legislation proved
uninspiring to strong gun-control advocates and was overshadowed twice
by the Supreme Court, which broadly expanded gun rights a day before
overturning Roe v. Wade. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said
voters would now have a clear choice between Democrats and \"MAGA
Republicans,\" using an acronym for allies of former President Donald
Trump. \"Elect more MAGA Republicans if you want nationwide abortion
bans, the jailing of women and doctors and no exemptions for rape or
incest. Or, elect more pro-choice Democrats to save Roe,\" Schumer said
in a statement. House Republicans welcomed the ruling and talked openly
about a path forward to \"end abortion in this country.\" \"The Supreme
Court\'s decision overturning Roe v. Wade, overturning that flawed
decision finally allows states and Congress to protect life in ways that
we never were able to for the last 50 years,\" Representative Steve
Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, told reporters.

Still, [some **Republicans believe** that the **Supreme Court\'s
decision** will backfire **against their party**]{.underline}, including
former President Donald Trump, who privately told his advisers that
[**overturning Roe** is \"**bad** **for Republicans**\"]{.underline} as
it could potentially impact some key voters such as suburban women, The
New York Times reported Friday. Jason Roe, the former executive director
of the state Republican Party in Michigan, said he is \"nervous\" about
the political implications of the Court\'s decision, according to
Politico, because \"the opportunities we should have with suburban women
become more complicated when that issue is on the table, and I think it
puts us on defense.\" One Trump adviser said that the former president
is \"convinced it won\'t help him in the future,\" referring to
abortion, according to The Washington Post on Friday, and that it is
better if other issues became the primary focus in the wake of the
midterms and the 2024 election. However, the [**Court\'s
ruling**]{.underline} might [work **in the Democrats\'** favor,
according to a former GOP congressman]{.underline}, who preferred to be
anonymous. \"**[The]{.underline}** only [**thing** \[Democrats\] have
got **going for them is** the **Roe** thing]{.underline}, which is what,
40 years of settled law that will be changed that will cause some
societal consternation,\" the congressman told Politico. \"And can they
turn that into some turnout? I think the answer is probably \'Yes.\'\"
\"Maybe instead of losing 45 seats, they lose 30,\" he added. \"There
will be a few seats that Republicans would have won without \[the
abortion rights decision\], and they may not win them now.\" Meanwhile,
a Republican operative familiar with polling in state and federal races,
who also spoke with Politico on the condition of anonymity, noted that
overturning Roe impacts swing voters who lean Republican. [\"It takes a
sizeable bloc of voters who were leaning \[Republican\], and **it gives
them reason to vote Democrat**,\"]{.underline} he said. \"And they
haven\'t had any reason to vote Democrat in quite a while.\" Political
commentator S.E. Cupp told CNN on Friday that politically she \"[can\'t
imagine a better voter turnout engine than this ruling for
Democrats]{.underline}\" in the midterms. \"And you can make the
argument that the Republicans\' legislative victories and the Supreme
Court victory by a conservative court are regressive, they\'re taking us
backwards. Whether you like them or not, you can\'t deny the fact that
[they\'re going backwards\...They\'re taking us back to a different time
when these weren\'t rights,\"]{.underline} she said, and added: \"It
really does feel anachronistic with where the country is, and so I think
that\'s a good message for Democrats.\" Newsweek reached out to
political scientist at Georgetown University Hans Noel, the spokesperson
for Republican political strategist Sarah Longwell, and Republican
political strategist Danny Diaz for comment.

### Uniqueness overwhelms

#### The Democrats will be wiped out -- history, Biden approval, inflation, secondary issues

6-26-2022

In 2020, my firm reached one of its peaks, correctly calling close but
clear wins for the Democrats in the House of Representatives and the
presidency, as well as precisely predicting the 50-50 split in the
Senate. For all our pride in this, the 2022 midterms are just around the
corner, with a new set of political imperatives that need to be
mastered. So, without further ado, here we go: **[The 2022 midterms will
result in a Republican wipeout of the Democrats]{.underline}**, with the
GOP gaining upwards of 30 seats in the House and one or two in the
Senate, giving them full control of the Congress. Here is the case for
our bold prediction.

First, **[the historical record is squarely against President Joe Biden
and the Democrats. Since 1870, only four elections out of 38 resulted in
the party holding the White House losing fewer than five seats, which is
the size of the party's present paper-thin majority in the
House.]{.underline}** Traditionally, **[the country tends to have
so-called buyer's remorse after the first two years of a
presidency]{.underline}**, either faulting the new team for failing to
live up to its campaign promises or conversely fearing the new White
House is trying to do too much. In either case, the opposition party has
been supported 34 out of 38 times as an institutional check on the new
president's power.

**[The rare exceptions to these overwhelming numbers merely prove the
rule]{.underline}**. Only exceptional circumstances (**[such as George
W. Bush benefiting from the rally-round-the-flag sentiment prevailing
after 9/11]{.underline}**) or presidents possessing exceptional
political skills (such as Franklin Roosevelt and Bill Clinton) buck this
historical near-inevitability.

To put it mildly, Biden has neither of these attributes going for him.
In the past generation, **[the best guide to a party's congressional
results has been the president's approval numbers]{.underline}**, as
House elections have increasingly become nationalized referendums on the
occupant of the White House. The RealClearPolitics' average of polling
finds **[Biden's approval ratings under water, with only 42 percent
supporting him, while 53 percent disapprove]{.underline}** of the job he
has been doing. Far from bucking the historical trend, Biden's polling
looks set to make it even worse than usual.

Second, **[out-of-control 8 percent inflation is seen as by far the most
important issue in polling and the Biden White House entirely owns it.
No one is buying that this is "Putin's price hike,"]{.underline}** as
the president has feebly taken to saying in an effort to pass the policy
failure on to the Russian leader. This is not working out in the country
for the simple reason that the beast of inflation had already loosed its
chains well ahead of the Ukraine war starting in late February. The
timing simply does not work for rampant inflation to be anything other
than primarily a Western institutional failure.

While spikes in energy and food prices have resulted directly from the
conflict, they amount to only the icing on the cake. As former Treasury
Secretary Larry Summers has made incisively clear, **[the Biden White
House and the Federal Reserve greatly overestimated the damage the
COVID-19 pandemic would do. As a result, the overegged economy had to
deal with 15 percent extra federal spending even as it quickly bounced
back.]{.underline}** The obvious result of this pouring gasoline on to a
roaring fire is the present 8 percent-plus inflation the US has and the
cost-of-living crisis that flows naturally from it. Stagflation (the US
economy declined in the first quarter of the year) absolutely destroyed
the presidency of Jimmy Carter 40 years ago. It is now doing the same to
the hapless Biden White House.

Third, **[a series of important but secondary issues --- all seen as
traditional weaknesses of the Democratic Party --- are coming back to
bite them. A crime wave in American inner cities]{.underline}** has been
blamed on earlier suicidal calls by the left wing of the party to defund
the police. And **[illegal immigration at the southern
border]{.underline}**, another traditional weakness of the party, has
swollen to a torrent. Finally, **[America's families are sick
of]{.underline}** recalcitrant (overwhelmingly Democratic) teachers'
unions who indefensibly seem to want their members to stay home for
ever, **[how]{.underline}**ever **[badly the country's children are
doing educationally after years of distance learning. Parents blame the
unions]{.underline}** for this calamity, along with their woke
allegiance to a critical race theory that paints America as irredeemably
racist. The self-hatred of the Democratic progressive left is generally
a bad political platform; it is badly wounding the party in general.

**[Worse still for the Democrats, none of these things are likely to
change.]{.underline}** The historical numbers are what they are;
inflation is unlikely to dramatically trend downwards, and immigration
and the crime wave will not be greatly altered in the next few months.
There is no avoiding the reality that a Democratic Party wipeout in the
midterms is by far the most likely outcome of the 2022 race. This call
is an easy one to make.

**[For Democrats this year, the only real question is whether the
elections will be only moderately bad or completely
terrible.]{.underline}** If you think like a weather forecaster, all
kinds of data point to a major storm. **[By basically every metric you
can think of --- fundraising, candidate recruitment, voter enthusiasm,
demographic shifts --- a big wave is forming that will sweep hundreds of
Democrats out of office, up and down the ticket.]{.underline}** The main
reason isn't hard to suss out. **[Every president can count on his party
losing seats in midterms]{.underline}**, but President **[Biden's
approval ratings are particularly bad]{.underline}**. On average, 41
percent of Americans approve of the job he's doing, compared with 54
percent who disapprove. "That is one of the lowest marks of any
president since World War II," says Henry Olsen, a conservative analyst
at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. "Unless that changes, I would
expect a solid Democratic defeat." Granted, President Donald **[Trump's
approval ratings were similarly bargain basement in 2018]{.underline}**
--- **[but then, Republicans lost control of the House that year, along
with seven governorships.]{.underline}** The more important comparison,
at any rate, is not with Trump but with Biden himself. **[Biden won the
presidency in 2020 by 4.5 points. If he's down 13, that represents a
huge drop in support, which seriously imperils his party. Swing voters
have swung hard against Biden. His net approval rating among
independents is roughly minus 20.]{.underline}** That's a group he
carried in 2020 by 13 points, according to exit polls. We've already
witnessed a demonstration of how the president's numbers can drag down
other Democrats. Last November, Biden's net disapproval numbers were
12.5 percent points lower than his victory margin in 2020. Guess what?
The swing from Biden's share of the vote to that won in 2020 by the
Democratic candidates for governor was 12 points. Gov. Phil Murphy
managed barely to hold on in New Jersey, but **[Democrat Terry McAuliffe
lost the governorship to Republican Glenn Youngkin in Virginia --- a
state Biden had carried a year earlier by 10 points. Now, Biden's
numbers are even lower than they were back in November. This means any
Democrat who won their last election by less than double-digit margins
should be nervous.]{.underline}** That certainly includes vulnerable
governors such as Tony Evers of Wisconsin and Laura Kelly of Kansas.
"The president's dismal ratings are what people care about the most,"
says GOP consultant David Carney. **["It could be a bloodbath up and
down the ballot, from the school board to Congress.\"]{.underline}**
There are several known unknowns that could shift the landscape between
now and Nov. 8. Inflation might tick lower and the war in Ukraine may
have played out in a way that helps Biden politically. Perhaps Tuesday's
school shooting in Texas will activate voters in a way that other mass
shootings have failed to do. An NPR/Marist poll released last week found
that the expected Supreme Court action to overturn Roe v. Wade should
help energize Democrats. Sixty-six percent of Democrats said it would
make them more likely to vote this fall, versus 40 percent of
Republicans. **["There are two big things that we don't know yet how
they will play:]{.underline}** The first one is **[the Jan. 6
committee]{.underline}** and its hearings, **[and]{.underline}** the
second one is **[this abortion decision]{.underline}**," says Lara
Brown, a political scientist at George Washington University. "Depending
on how those capture the attention of the country and different
demographics, I do think that can impact the magnitude of what ever wave
the Republicans are looking at." **[But in the weeks
since]{.underline}** Justice Samuel **[Alito's]{.underline}** majority
**[opinion]{.underline}** on abortion law **[was leaked, there's been no
evidence of a surge in Democratic participation in primaries or early
voting. Not even any real uptick.]{.underline}** "I'd be surprised if
Roe v. Wade did not energize the marginal Democratic voter, the sort
that would usually vote in the presidential race but not necessarily in
the midterm, but that only gets you so far," Olsen says. "The real game
is the swing voter." Undoing Obama's Coalition Biden's old boss, Barack
**[Obama, put together a winning coalition]{.underline}** during his
presidency, combining **[college-educated whites with young, Black and
Latino voters]{.underline}**. The danger for Democrats is that Biden
appears to be unraveling that coalition. About the only groups still
solidly in his camp are dedicated members of the Democratic base, such
as Black voters and college-educated women. Biden carried close to
two-thirds of **[Hispanic voters]{.underline}** in 2020, but their
**[shift toward Trump, compared to 2016, was notable, especially in
states such as Florida and Texas]{.underline}**. In the Texas primaries
in March this year, participation in GOP primaries was up dramatically
in heavily Hispanic portions of South Texas that traditionally have been
overwhelmingly Democratic. An NPR/Marist poll released last month found
that **[52 percent of Latinos say they're more likely to support
Republican candidates for Congress; just 39 percent favor
Democrats.]{.underline}** Young voters have been a particular problem
for Biden. Voters under 30 favored Biden over Trump, 60 percent to 39
percent, in 2020, but they've soured on him since. **[Biden's approval
rating among young voters has dropped by 18 points over the past
year]{.underline}**, according to a Harvard Institute of Politics poll
-- which is in line with what other pollsters are finding. Even as
Democrats shed support among Latinos, young voters and parents, **[the
party's longstanding problem with working-class white voters continues
to worsen]{.underline}**. The April NPR/Marist poll found Democrats are
only favored by a third of white voters without college degrees,
compared to **[55 percent]{.underline}** who **[say they are likely to
support Republicans.]{.underline}** "The people who are left backing
Biden are the people who would back any Democrat under anything except
extreme circumstances," Olsen says. "That's a terrible place to be in
for an election. You've lost America's middle." Generically Bad **[The
NPR/Marist poll asked what is known as a generic ballot
question]{.underline}** --- are you more likely to favor a Republican or
a Democrat --- rather than asking about any individual candidates who
might be on the ballot. Candidates do matter. Republicans were notably
unhappy that Pennsylvania voters decided to nominate conspiracy-minded
state Sen. Doug Mastriano for governor last week, viewing him as more
likely to lose in November than other potential picks. Similarly,
Republican officials in Missouri are hoping another candidate can
coalesce enough support to stop Eric Greitens, who resigned as governor
in disgrace in 2018 amid multiple scandals, from winning nomination to
the Senate. Republicans left winnable seats on the table in 2010 and
2012 by nominating "unacceptable" candidates unable to win in the
general election, as Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky himself said last month. "From an atmospheric point of view,
it's a perfect storm of problems for the Democrats," McConnell said.
"How could you screw this up? It's actually possible. And we've had some
experience with that in the past." McConnell was referring to the
100-seat Senate, which is currently tied. There are relatively few
Democratic seats in play this year, meaning each race will count
enormously. Still, Republicans have enough opportunities not only to win
the majority but come away with a total of perhaps 53 or 54 seats. The
GOP needs only five seats to take control of the 435-member House.
Redistricting has turned out to be more or less a wash, but on net
Republicans gained a slight advantage. A lot of GOP-tilted seats have
been fortified against all but the worst-case scenarios, while Democrats
hold more seats that are marginal. They'll have little protection in a
wave year. There's hardly any ticket-splitting, with voters favoring
candidates of one party or the other up and down the ballot. There are
only 16 seats in the House where the district voted one way for
president in 2020 and the other for Congress. **[The players matter, but
sometimes the playing field matters more. In the most competitive House
districts, generic Republicans are leading generic Democrats by 47
percent to 39 percent.]{.underline}** That's according to internal
polling by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Even bad
candidates can win in the right environment, which this is shaping up to
be for Republicans. "We're going to have a lot of people winning that no
one ever heard of," Carney says. Messaging and Money The abortion issue
may help Democrats politically in a couple of ways. It could help
inspire young voters who don't like the GOP but aren't Biden stans. It
also gives the party something to talk about. Since the Alito leak,
Democrats have been much more full-throated in support of abortion
rights than Republicans have been about its demise. Democrats would like
to think they can easily convince voters that Republicans can't be
trusted since they support the election lies of a twice-impeached coup
leader. But if tying Republicans to Trump were a winning strategy, it
would have paid off for McAuliffe in Virginia, who certainly tried it.
Republicans aren't made of Teflon. The very term "culture war" suggests
there are two sides battling, so efforts to ban books or restrict the
teaching of racial history and gender identity won't play well with
everyone. "The more the party focused on these culture war issues, I
actually believe the less it will help them in the suburbs," says Brown,
the George Washington University professor. But culture war issues
motivate the party's base. And, to appeal to swing voters, Republicans
have plenty of other clubs with which to beat Biden and the Democrats.
Maybe you've already heard this, but inflation has jumped the most in
four decades. Gas prices, already at a retail average of \$4.60 per
gallon, may well go higher with summer travel demand --- perhaps as high
as \$6. Homicides have increased dramatically since 2019, fueling a
return to "tough on crime" rhetoric among Republicans. It\'s all easy
fodder for an opposition party to run on. Polls indicate that voters
trust the GOP more, by significant margins, when it comes to inflation
and the economy in general. Republicans are enjoying their biggest
advantage regarding the crime issue in decades. All of this is reflected
in how partisans are responding. **[The gap between the numbers of
Democrats and Republicans retiring from Congress is the highest it's
been in decades]{.underline}**. At the legislative level, Republicans
are leaving fewer seats open than Democrats. Republicans raised \$170
million from January to March through WinRed, an online fundraising
platform. That still lags the Democrats' ActBlue, which has
traditionally been much more robust, but represents nearly a one-quarter
jump for WinRed over the same period in 2020. The Republican Governors
Association raised \$33 million in the first quarter of the year, which
was nearly \$10 million more than the Democratic Governors Association.
The Republican State Leadership Committee brought in just over \$10
million, compared with \$6.5 million for the Democratic Legislative
Campaign Committee. Who Will Turn Out? In the end, **[voter behavior
matters most of all]{.underline}**. Again, **[the GOP has a big
advantage.]{.underline}** **[A slew of polls have showed large and
indeed growing gaps in terms of levels of enthusiasm]{.underline}**
about voting this year between Republicans and Democrats. But we don't
have to rely strictly on polls any more. We're still relatively early in
the primary season, but Republicans are showing up in ways that
Democrats are not. In the first 10 states to hold primaries this year,
Republicans received 61 percent of the total vote, according to an
analysis by GOP pollster John Couvillon. The party generating more
enthusiasm in primaries has fared quite well in the last few midterms.
Democrats received 54 percent of the primary vote in 2018 --- a solid
midterm year for them --- while Republicans got 55 percent in both 2010
and 2014, landslide years for the party. It's true that primary turnout
isn't a perfect measure, since not all races are equally competitive. On
Tuesday, for example, Stacey Abrams was unopposed for the Democratic
nomination for governor of Georgia, while GOP Gov. Brian Kemp faced a
contentious, if ultimately easy, contest against former Sen. David
Perdue. Turnout on the GOP side increased by a half-million votes,
compared to the 2018 primary. But looking at the total picture**[, it's
clear more Republicans are turning out. A lot more
Republicans.]{.underline}** Overall **[Republican primary turnout is up
32 percent, while Democratic turnout has actually declined 3 percent.
All this paints a pretty grim picture for Democrats. They're running
behind on the issues that concern voters most. Their leader is losing
support among key constituencies. Their potential candidates are less
likely to run, while their voters are less likely to turn
out.]{.underline}** It's clear that Republicans will be stronger at the
end of the year than they are now. It's not yet possible to say how much
stronger, but if anyone offers to bet you Democrats will retain power in
Congress, take their money. At the state level, GOP victories may not be
as momentous, but that's only because they already hold majorities among
governors, legislators and legislative chambers. **[For Republicans,
it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas will fall early this year,
on Nov. 8.]{.underline}**

### A2 Win for Biden

#### Russia actually not a win for Biden in the mind of voters

Ukraine if Trump were president: poll" The Hill, February 25, 22,
https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/595919-62-percent-of-voters-say-putin-wouldnt-have-invaded-ukraine-if-trump/

A **[majority of American voters say that]{.underline}** Russian
President **[Vladimir Putin would not have invaded Ukraine
had]{.underline}** former President [Trump still been in
office,]{.underline} according to a new survey released on Friday. A new
Harvard Center for American Political Studies (CAPS)-Harris Poll survey
released Friday found that [**62 percent** of those polled believed
Putin would **not be moving against Ukraine if Trump had been
president**]{.underline}. When looking strictly at the answers of
Democrats and Republicans, 85 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of
Democrats answered this way. However, 38 percent of all Americans polled
believed that Putin would have invaded Ukraine even if Trump had been
president. Trump's critics contend that the former president's
relationship with Putin was extremely cozy. For example, Trump publicly
called for Russia to be admitted to the G-7 and has repeatedly
criticized Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has staunchly
defended the independence of Ukraine. The House twice impeached Trump,
the first time related to his opposition to providing Ukraine with
military aid[. A majority of Americans polled --- **59 percent** ---
also said they believed that the Russian president moved on Ukraine
because Putin **saw weakness in President Biden**]{.underline}, while 41
percent said that it was not a factor in Putin's decision to invade
Ukraine. Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine late Wednesday, President
Biden condemned what he described as an "unprovoked and unjustified
attack" and expressed solidarity with Ukraine. The U.S. has imposed
sanctions on Russian financial institutions, Russian elites and their
family members, the Nord Stream 2 AG --- the parent company of the Nord
Stream 2 pipeline --- and, the White House confirmed Friday, Putin
himself, among other entities. However, the U.S. has resisted calls to
kick Russia out of the SWIFT international banking system, despite
appeals from Ukrainian officials and some U.S. lawmakers. The polling
comes after Biden has suffered low approval ratings in recent months.
Since taking office, the president has had to navigate a multitude of
issues, including a lingering COVID-19 pandemic, a chaotic evacuation
from Afghanistan, infighting among Democrats over the administration's
legislative agenda and now the invasion of Ukraine. The Harvard
CAPS-Harris Poll survey was conducted between Feb. 23 and Feb. 24 with
2,026 registered voters. The survey is an online sample drawn from the
Harris Panel and weighted to reflect known demographics. As a
representative online sample, it does not report a probability
confidence interval.

#### No one cares about foreign policy during midterms.

Cook Political Report. "Foreign Policy Unlikely to Save Democrats in the
Fall". National journal. February 2022.
https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/foreign-policy-unlikely-save-democrats-fall)

Biden's 41 percent overall approval rating in Gallup was bracketed by a
[[47 percent approval on handling the
coronavirus]{.underline}](https://news.gallup.com/poll/390086/biden-ratings-economy-foreign-affairs-russia-near.aspx),
36 percent on handling "the situation with Russia," 37 percent on the
economy, and 40 percent for foreign policy. Given how monolithic
partisans are in their approval ratings and actual voting, it is always
useful to look only at independents, the 'jump ball' Americans. Biden's
overall rating among them was 35 percent (5 points below his approval
among all adults). His best marks were on dealing with the coronavirus
(45 percent approval), followed by foreign policy (37 percent), Russia
(35 percent), and the economy (30 percent). It is pretty clear the
president and his administration's denial of the threat of inflation and
slow reaction to it was exceedingly damaging to him. (While we are on
the subject, it is fascinating to see Senate Democrats, after so
passionately advocating for more infrastructure spending this past year,
propose suspending the gasoline tax for the rest of the year, no matter
that the gas tax is the primary regular funding source for
transportation infrastructure. Panic is never pretty.) While we don't
know the trajectory that the Russia/Ukraine crisis will take, and there
are [[many factors that can impact on midterm
elections]{.underline}](https://www.vox.com/22899204/midterm-elections-president-biden-thermostatic-opinion),
we do know that [in the absence of a large number of U.S. military
deaths, **Americans rarely vote on foreign-policy issues, particularly
in midterms**. The state and direction of the economy, particularly
[change in real disposable personal
income](https://www.mischiefsoffaction.com/post/2022-midterm-forecast),
is far more determinative.]{.underline} Turnout and the relative levels
of enthusiasm between the two parties' bases is key. There was a big gap
heading into the 2018 midterm elections with, as usual, the party out of
power much more motivated going into the fall of that year---though the
Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination did a lot to close the gap in
predominantly rural areas, which helped Republicans actually score a net
gain in the Senate while getting hosed (a political science term) in the
House. Right now, Democrats are the party suffering from a lack of
motivation among their base. [If someone wanting a read on a midterm is
only going to watch two things, it should be a **president's approval
rating** and the [**generic congressional ballot
test**](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/forecasting-the-2022-midterm-election-with-the-generic-ballot/),]{.underline}
both pretty good barometers of which way the wind is blowing and whether
it's light, moderate, or heavy.

"Memo: Dems Need To Focus On Winning The Economic Argument," January 27,
22, https://www.ndn.org/memo-dems-need-focus-winning-economic-argument

Winning The Economic Argument -- This week we hosted noted economist Rob
Shapiro for a terrific discussion of his two recent essays in the
Washington Monthly, It's A Biden Boom -- And No One Has Noticed Yet and
The Biden Boom Is Bigger Than We Thought. You can watch it here. The two
essays make clear that 2021 was a banner year for the American economy,
one of the best in the post WWII era -- 6m jobs, 5+% GDP growth, record
new business formations, real wage gains for the bottom 50% of workers,
5m people gaining health insurance, booming housing and stock markets.
[There can be no doubt that the **vast majority** of Americans are
**better off today than they were a year ago**]{.underline}, and given
the daily adversity we all faced due to COVID, we need to tip our hats
to the resilience, ingenuity and can do spirit of the American people.
The question of why the electorate doesn't understand that the economy
is better, and why Americans give Republicans a big advantage on the
economy right now when their recent track while in office is among the
worst in American history (3 consecutive recessions) are among the most
important questions in American politics today. [It is very hard to see
how Democrats are competitive in the elections this fall without doing
something significant to change voter's basic understanding of how just
much better the economy is today, and how much better the economy has
been with Democrats in power over the past 30 plus years]{.underline}
(40m of the 42m jobs created since 1989 have been created under
Democratic Presidents). [As a matter of politics, changing this
understanding should be the singular mission of the Democratic Party in
2022]{.underline}. There are many forms a big campaign like this could
take, but there are two pieces which Democrats should consider right
away: The DNC Leads A Big Conversation About How With Democrats Things
Get Better -- The DNC should take on this mission, and organize a
yearlong education effort involving every element of the party across
the country. Power points, videos, fact sheets, web sites should be
developed, and every state and local party have to make it be their goal
to be loud and proud about the achievements of Joe Biden and the
Democrats more broadly this year. Language and arguments should be
tested, workshopped. A large multimedia ad campaign should be developed
to support the free media effort, and it should run in the second
quarter of this year, from mid-April to July 4th. Every Democrat should
be asked to contribute to this vital effort, and a target goal of \$50m
should be established. Voters need to know this information now, not in
the fall -- that is when candidates have to do their job. Other elements
of the center-left family with resources can amplify the effort[. At a
strategy level the goal should be to **get the Democrats even or ahead
with Republicans on the economy**]{.underline} by Labor Day**[, making
it far more likely the election will be competitive this
fall.]{.underline}** A campaign like this also has the benefit of
bringing the party back together around a singular mission, something we
think the party can use right now. Elected Officials Do Months of Events
Showing How Much Better Things Are -- In research NDN did in late 2010
and early 2011, we asked voters who did they need to hear from to know a
recovery was taking place. The clear answer was local business people.
Voters told us that if they heard it from a brewery which had hired a
few more people, or a factory that was going to two shifts, then they
would believe a recovery was taking place. That work informed the work
of the Obama White House, and Senate and House Democrats over the next
few years as we struggled to help people understand a recovery was
indeed taking place. Today's elected Democrats should tear some pages
from this playbook, and spend most of their public events in state or
district in the coming months with local business people who can
validate that things are better. These local leaders could also become
stars in campaign ads and videos. The efforts to play up the
Infrastructure Bill should be seen as part of this effort, and not stand
alone; for there are limits to how much political benefit Democrats will
get from things people will not see or feel before November. As the
incumbent party, Democrats will be judged this fall largely on whether
voters think we've done a good job, that things are better. Things are
better, and we should spend the next 10 months relentlessly making the
case that they are. Every moment we spend talking about things which
will not be felt by the election should be understood now as a
distraction[. We have a vital argument to win this year; one we can win;
and one we must win to make the elections competitive this
fall.]{.underline} And we need to keep repeating -- if we can't get
credit for what we've done, it's unlikely we are going to get credit for
things which haven't happened yet. Things are better[. With Democrats
things are better. Things are better today than they were a year
ago.]{.underline} Let's get to work people. Final note -- we are not as
convinced as others that inflation is the central reason [Democrats have
struggled to break through on the economy this year.]{.underline} For
more on that see here. We believe the central reason we haven't broken
through is that we haven't tried hard enough. That's a fixable thing,
and what this plan tries to address. Does this plan assume the economy
stays strong in 2022, and we can keep making the argument? Yep[. It is
the likely scenario and we should go for it.]{.underline}

### A2 NATO

#### Republicans support NATO expansion, Finland and Sweden will help share the load with military. 

**Zengerle '22** (Patricia Zengerle is a Correspondent for Congress and
National Security in the Thomson Reuters, "U.S. Republicans Join
Democrats in Backing NATO Expansion Despite Rising Nationalism,"

https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2022-05-23/u-s-republicans-join-democrats-in-backing-nato-expansion-despite-rising-nationalism)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic and Republican U.S. Senate leaders
introduced a resolution on Monday backing Sweden and Finland\'s bids to
join NATO, underscoring support for expanding the alliance despite
growing nationalism in the Republican party[.]{.underline} It will take
a two-thirds majority in the 100-member Senate to approve the expansion
of the alliance, requiring \"yes\" votes from at least 17 Republicans
along with every Democrat. [Many U.S. Republicans]{.underline} have been
following the lead of former President Donald Trump - the party\'s
leader - toward [more nationalist foreign policy]{.underline}. [Trump
accused **NATO allies** of **not spending enough on their own defense**
and excessively **burdening** **the U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}.
Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine has prompted Finland and Sweden to apply
to join NATO. In the Senate, [11 Republicans voted \"no\" last week
against legislation providing \$40 billion to help Ukraine]{.underline},
with some saying they wanted the funds director to Americans. Last
month, [63 Republican members of the House]{.underline} of
Representatives, nearly one-third of the full caucus, [opposed a bill
reaffirming U.S. support for NATO.]{.underline} The top Senate
Republican, Mitch McConnell, and Jim Risch, the top Republican on the
foreign relations panel, joined Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer and committee chairman Bob Menendez and other senators in
introducing the resolution. \"We fully support their application to
become NATO members and are looking forward to their swift ascension in
the coming months,\" Menendez said in a statement. McConnell referred to
[**Finland and Sweden** as \"strong countries with formidable military
capabilities\"]{.underline} and said in his statement, [\"both nations\'
robust defense funding means their accession **would** meaningfully
**bolster our pursuit of greater burden-sharing across the

#### GOP supports NATO unification, Ukraine a reason.

[**Republican** U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul]{.underline} of Austin is the
top House Republican on foreign affairs and [voted to **support
NATO**]{.underline}. On Wednesday, [he sported a blue-and-gold Ukrainian
ribbon]{.underline} on his suit jacket at the Capitol. He
[told]{.underline} The Texas Tribune that [**NATO countries are
"stepping up**" in ways some countries had **lagged
before**.]{.underline} A frequent conservative critique of NATO is that
many European countries fall short of the expected standard that all
member countries spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. ["NATO is
more unified than it's ever been. Germany]{.underline} now is putting in
2% of their GDP. And they [are sending weapons and they are
training,"]{.underline} he said. NATO bonds further frayed in recent
years, as Trump regularly railed against the alliance. But his criticism
did lead to [several NATO countries]{.underline} deciding to [increase
their **defense spending**.]{.underline} Everything changed six weeks
ago when Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, a country on
the Eastern European frontier that long aspired to join the
organization. Several NATO countries located near Ukraine, like Poland,
are most impacted by the refugee exodus from Ukraine. At the heart of
NATO is an agreement among all 30 countries known as Article 5, which
states an attack on one NATO member country is an attack on all NATO
allies. The 9/11 attacks on the United States are the single time in the
alliance's existence that Article 5 has been invoked. Former NATO
Ambassador Kay Bailey Hutchison addressed the vote in an interview with
the Tribune on Wednesday. Hutchison carefully noted she had not read the
language in the House resolution but insisted the political
establishment is behind NATO. ["I know we have **bipartisan support for
NATO**]{.underline} --- I know that," she told Tribune CEO Evan Smith,
pointing to her former colleagues in the U.S. Senate. "We have that
bipartisan support," she later added. "I've seen it[." **U.S. Rep**.
Colin Allred]{.underline}, a Dallas Democrat who serves on the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, seemed mystified that so many Texans voted
against a resolution supporting **[NATO]{.underline}**, noting that the
last two Republican presidents prior to Trump --- George H.W. Bush and
George W. Bush --- were NATO boosters. "I really don't know what to make
of it," he said. ["We've seen how **important** it is, and I find it
really hard to understand."]{.underline}

### Election interference

#### Foreign interference won't affect outcomes---no external internet accessibility and too many built in redundancies.

A month after 20,000 private emails from the Democratic National
Committee were published online, election officials across the country
received a series of warnings from the FBI: Hackers were targeting
states' election websites and, in at least one case, were able to steal
voter registration data. The Department of Homeland Security has since
created an election cybersecurity action campaign, and US intelligence
officials have begun investigating the possibility of a covert Russian
intelligence operation that seeks to undermine the integrity of the
American election.

But **[despite the growing concerns over foreign meddling coming from
Congress, intelligence experts, and the Clinton campaign, state election
officials say American voters have little to fear.]{.underline}**

**["There are over 9,000 jurisdictions that operate elections at a very
local level, so that's both a blessing and a curse,"]{.underline}**
Denise Merrill, Connecticut's secretary of state and president of the
National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), a nonpartisan
organization that represents the country's top state election officials,
told BuzzFeed News. **["It really saves us from worrying too much about
cybersecurity --- we have other concerns, but that's kind of not one of
them."]{.underline}**

Merrill was appointed by NASS to join Homeland Security's special
working group on election cybersecurity. The group's goal is to build
closer ties between the federal government and local election officials,
and also to consider designating state voting systems as "critical
infrastructure," akin to dams and power grids, granting election offices
additional resources and protections from the federal government.

Merrill, along with the secretaries of state and election officials
representing California, Florida, Ohio, Minnesota, Colorado, and Iowa,
told BuzzFeed News that **[pre--Election Day simulations, paper trail
audits, and the fact that voting machines are not connected to the web
provide strong safeguards to the electoral system.]{.underline}**

State election officials emphasized that **[the recent hack into voter
registration databases differs from the risks faced by their offices,
because these databases aren't directly tied to voting on Election Day
and because voting machines cannot be accessed remotely through the
internet.]{.underline}** "That's **[the voter registration
system]{.underline}**, which **[is not at all connected to the actual
voting]{.underline}**," Merrill said, adding **[that in almost every
state, voter registration is completed on paper. "There are backup paper
systems for every process in our election, and that means cybersecurity
is not the concern that it's being portrayed to be
nationally."]{.underline}**

### Emerging tech

#### Americans don't support emerging tech legislation

**Zhang 19** \[Baobao Zhang . \"Public opinion lessons for AI
regulation\". 12-10-2019. Brookings.

An overwhelming majority of the American public believes that artificial
intelligence (AI) should be carefully managed. Nevertheless, as the
three case studies in this brief show, **[the public does not agree on
the proper regulation of AI applications]{.underline}**. Indeed,
population-level support of an AI application may belie opposition by
some subpopulations. Many AI applications, such as facial recognition
technology, could cause disparate harm to already vulnerable subgroups,
particularly ethnic minorities and low-income individuals. In addition,
partisan divisions are likely to prevent government regulation of AI
applications that could be used to influence electoral politics. **[In
particular, the regulation of content recommendation algorithms used by
social media platforms has been highly contestable]{.underline}**.
Finally, **[mobilizing an influential group of political actors, such as
machine learning researchers in the campaign against lethal autonomous
weapons, may be more effective in shifting policy debates than
mobilizing the public at large. Algorithms used to recommend content on
social media have increasingly come under scrutiny]{.underline}**.
Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube use machine learning to
suggest media content and advertisements that optimize for user
engagement. **[Civil society groups and researchers have expressed
concerns that these algorithms help spread
misinformation]{.underline}**, proliferate digital propaganda, create
partisan echo chambers, and promote violent extremism. Unlike facial
recognition technology that could more readily be managed at the local
or state level, social media platforms have users across the U.S. and
around the world. California has sought to regulate online bots and
protect consumer privacy, setting the terms of the debate for federal
regulations. However, it remains to be seen if the federal government
will follow the way of California or oppose the state's policies. In the
U.S., legislation to regulate social media platforms has stalled because
of the divergent policy priorities of the two parties. **[In light of
Russian intervention in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the
Cambridge Analytica scandal, Congress has held several hearings to
investigate and castigate tech companies]{.underline}**. The techlash
from the left and the right are different: Democrats prioritize the
prevention of digital manipulation and consumer privacy while
**[Republicans focus on alleged bias against
conservatives]{.underline}**. Democratic senators have introduced
legislation that would increase transparency for online campaign
advertisements and require tech companies to safeguard users' sensitive
data**[. Republican lawmakers have accused social media platforms of
censoring conservative viewpoints]{.underline}**, despite evidence to
the contrary. The Trump White House is reportedly drafting an executive
order to combat this alleged bias. The American public is concerned
about the lack of accountability by tech companies that operate social
media platforms, but does not agree on policy solutions. According to a
report from the Pew Research Center, 51% of the U.S. public thinks that
tech companies should be regulated more than they are now. At the same
time, Americans indicate that they have greater trust in tech companies
than the U.S. federal government to manage the development and use of AI
in the best interests of the public, per data from the Center for the
Governance of AI. The public is evenly split on whether there should be
regulation of content recommendation algorithms based on political
affiliations or political viewpoints, according to a 2017 Harvard/Harris
Poll survey. The partisan division among lawmakers in Congress is also
reflected in public opinion. There exists a stark asymmetry in how
Republicans and Democrats perceive bias in social media platforms and
tech companies. While **[54% of Republicans think it is very likely that
social media platforms censor political viewpoints]{.underline}**, only
20% of Democrats do, according to a survey from the Pew Research Center.
Conversely, while 53% of Democrats think major tech companies support
the views of liberals and conservatives equally, only 28% of Republicans
feel the same way. With political gridlock hindering governmental
regulation of algorithms used by social media platforms, tech companies
have tried to answer their critics through industry self-regulation.
Nevertheless, industry self-regulation is not immune to underlying
conflicts in American politics. For instance, Google's AI ethics board
dissolved after the company's employees and outside civil society groups
protested the inclusion of Heritage Foundation president Kay Coles James
and drone company CEO Dyan Gibbens on the board.
