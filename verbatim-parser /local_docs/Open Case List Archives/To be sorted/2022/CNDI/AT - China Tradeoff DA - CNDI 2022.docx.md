### Ukraine Thumper

#### Ukraine thumps the link -- Biden already losing in Asia. 

**Townshend and Corben '22** (Ashley Townshend is director of foreign
policy and defense and Tom Corben is a research associate in the foreign
policy and defense program at the United States Studies Centre at the
University of Sydney. "Op-Ed: War in Ukraine Threatens America\'s
Ability to Counter China," The Strategist, MAR 16, 2022,

[As the United States slides deeper into a proxy war with Russia,
Indo-Pacific countries are increasingly concerned]{.underline} about the
long-term implications of the Ukraine crisis for America's power and
position in this part of the world. And so they should be. While
President Joe Biden's initial approach to Ukraine struck the right
balance of resolve and restraint---marshalling global allies in support
of sanctions against Russia and funnelling military and humanitarian aid
to Ukraine---**[the war is now sapping more and more American attention
and defence resources.]{.underline}** A dangerous tit for tat is taking
hold. [Washington's lethal military aid and economy-breaking sanctions
signal an investment in the war that could slip beyond Biden's original
articulation]{.underline} of limited interests. Russia's nuclear threats
and increasingly brutal operations have triggered further US
involvement, including the deployment of advanced F-35 fighters and
expensive Patriot missile-defence systems to NATO frontlines in Eastern
Europe, and a massive \$13.6 billion Ukraine emergency bill passed by
Congress last week. Calls are getting louder for a 'limited no-fly zone'
which, though rebuffed so far, may become politically harder to resist.
All this is understandable given the humanitarian carnage. But hot on
the heels of the release of Biden's Indo-Pacific strategy, [it's
unsettling to watch Washington's **strategic gaze** drift]{.underline},
once again, [away from a robust \"pivot to Asia.\"]{.underline} As we
argue in a new United States Studies Centre report, these developments
are especially worrying given that the Biden administration has so far
failed to deliver on key defense components of its regional strategy.
Senior US officials insist that events in Europe will not see the
Indo-Pacific or efforts to balance Chinese power deprioritised. Earlier
this month, the White House's Indo-Pacific coordinator, Kurt Campbell,
again promised that Washington was capable of sustaining \"deep
commitments\" in both theaters simultaneously, even at great cost, just
as it had in the past. But while America can---and must---continue to
buttress European security, it doesn't enjoy the luxury of riches or
unchallenged military primacy required to underwrite an expansive global
strategy against two great-power rivals. Matching ends with means in the
Indo-Pacific---America's so-called 'priority theatre'---requires
difficult trade-offs between competing priorities, including in Ukraine.
A more sustainable division of US and allied defense responsibilities in
Europe and Asia is urgently required. Biden understands this and
deserves credit for attempting to match US global interests and
commitments in his first year. Poor execution aside, his Afghan
withdrawal showed a willingness to make tough, politically unpopular
trade-offs. His initially restrained approach to the Ukraine crisis
suggested he would keep it in global strategic perspective. But
[Washington won't be able to sideline Moscow from its foreign policy
agenda the way it had hoped.]{.underline} [Delays to the publication of
the US national defense strategy and national security strategy suggest
that Russia is forcing a hurried reassessment of Biden's global
priorities. In a worst-case scenario for the Indo-Pacific, it's possible
these documents will return US military strategy to an equally weighted
focus on Asia and Europe]{.underline}---contradicting hard-fought
efforts in recent years to make China the Pentagon's outright priority.
This is not a callous point to make. America simply doesn't have the
military resources required to prosecute an effective multi-theater
strategy in an era of great-power rivalry. Nor is it spending enough to
change this equation: while the 2018 national defence strategy
recommended three to five percent real growth in defense spending
annually to keep pace with China and Russia, not a single defense budget
since has met these targets. Biden's budget continues this
unsatisfactory trend. And in contrast to the stark warnings from top
brass at US Indo-Pacific Command, who see conflict with China as a
possibility this decade, [the administration's defense budget
prioritizes long-term military modernization in anticipation of high-end
conflict in the 2030s - leaving the US underprepared to deal with
Chinese military coercion over the next few years. Budget shortfalls are
mirrored by slow-moving efforts to realign US forces
globally.]{.underline} Efforts to empower US allies are even more
important as Washington is once again pulled in conflicting global
directions. Indo-Pacific allies should advocate for more. As a priority,
Australia should caucus with Japan and other close security partners to
push for overdue reforms to US export controls on defense technology.
Indo-Pacific allies should also press Washington for greater insight and
input into its regional military planning. A credible collective defence
strategy requires clarity on when, where and how to address shared
defence challenges. Biden's effort to build support among regional
allies for a Taiwan contingency is a step in this direction. But while
Taiwan is the Pentagon's \"pacing challenge,\" regional countries face
Chinese military coercion across a far wider range of lower intensity
scenarios, as China's intimidation of an Australian military aircraft in
the Arafura Sea last month attests. New strategic planning initiatives
must reflect these realities. In the end, however, these initiatives
can't change the strategic physics of the Indo-Pacific. A favorable
balance of power with China can only be upheld with unprecedented US
support. Alliance modernization is a necessary component of this
strategy, but it's not a substitute for a robust US military posture and
presence in the Indo-Pacific. [As the conflict in Ukraine grinds on,
America's capacity to deliver an effective defense strategy for the
region will depend on its ability to keep its escalating involvement in
check and in global strategic perspective.]{.underline}

[With the **world's attention fixed** on]{.underline} the national
security and humanitarian catastrophe in [Ukraine]{.underline} caused by
Russian President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion, [a similar
disaster is brewing in the Pacific]{.underline}. [Taking a page from
Putin's playbook, the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party, or
[CCP]{.underline}, [is methodically assembling combat power to coerce or
conquer the free people of Taiwan]{.underline}. [Preventing that from
happening will require Washington to learn the right lessons
from]{.underline} the disaster in [Ukraine]{.underline}. [Among them is
the need for Washington to **spend less time worrying** about provoking
authoritarian bullies and more time working to defend]{.underline}
threatened [democracies]{.underline} before the invasion starts. This is
especially critical as U.S. forces are much more likely to be directly
involved in a response to coercion against Taiwan. For 25 years, Beijing
has pursued a determined strategy featuring military modernization,
technological advancements, economic infiltration, cyberattacks and
persistent disinformation campaigns. These efforts have focused on
building a world-class military, erasing American military supremacy in
the seas and skies around Taiwan, and preparing for a potential attack
designed to establish CCP dominion over Taiwan. Meanwhile, **[the United
States has been distracted]{.underline}** elsewhere, **[unable to focus
its strategic and fiscal efforts on the rising power in
China]{.underline}**. [This has been compounded by consistent
congressional failures to provide the Pentagon with the timely,
sufficient and predictable funding necessary to modernize U.S. forces
and maintain sufficient readiness and capacity]{.underline}. Indeed,
[the Department of Defense has received on-time funding only once in the
last 13 fiscal years]{.underline}. Exacerbating these dynamics,
[Washington has been slow in addressing serious concerns and specific
requests for resources identified by Indo-Pacific Command]{.underline}
in successive reports to Congress. Just last year, the command again
warned that [the military balance of power in the region continues to
become "**more** **unfavorable**" for America and its
allies]{.underline}.

### No Trade-Off

#### No trade-off -- the US is and can focus on both. 

**Garamone '22** (Jim, Reporter for DOD News, "Austin: How the U.S.
Walks, Chews Gum at the Same Time," June 13, 2022,
<https://www.safia.hq.af.mil/IA-News/Article/3062747/austin-how-the-us-walks-chews-gum-at-the-same-time/>)-mikee

The Indo-Pacific is a U.S. national security strategy priority, but the
United States is a global power with global interests and
responsibilities, and \"we are walking and chewing gum at the same
time,\" Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said today in Bangkok.
As the United States works toward a free and open Indo-Pacific it also
is leading the effort to supply Ukraine with the arms, ammunition and
supplies it needs to defend itself against an unprovoked war. Further,
[the U.S. military has worked to reassure NATO allies]{.underline} with
the addition of more than 20,000 U.S. service members in the European
theater. [At the same time, there are 300,000 service members serving in
the Indo-Pacific. **The reason the United States can \"walk and chew gum
at the same time\" is because of the unparalleled network of allies and
partners**]{.underline}. Austin\'s current trip around the world is an
example how the U.S. values and relies on that network of allies. The
trip started with a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
at the command that symbolizes the close bond between the two countries
--- the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado Springs,
Colorado. From there, Austin went to the Shangri-La Dialogue in
Singapore and then to Bangkok, where he conferred with the United
States\' oldest treaty ally. Austin spoke to reporters at the end of his
meetings with Thailand Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Prayut
Chan-o-cha to put the trip into perspective. At Shangri-La, Austin
delivered a major speech about \"the centrality of this region to vital
U.S. interests and the vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific that we
share with our regional allies and partners.\" And the secretary also
used the gathering of defense ministers to participate in bilateral and
trilateral meetings with allies and partners. These included Singapore,
Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, the countries of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations, Australia and China. The secretary plainly
laid out U.S. concerns and proposals for the region. He spoke about the
need for communication between China and the United States to lessen the
chances of an escalation. He spoke of concerns over China\'s behaviors
as it tries to assert control over international waterways and air
lanes. He also said the United States \"never shies away from honest
competition, but we don\'t seek conflict, nor do we seek a region
that\'s split into hostile blocks.\" The dialogue \"was an important
opportunity to raise our concerns about the potential for instability in
the Taiwan Strait and to underscore that our long-standing policy toward
Taiwan is unwavering and unchanged,\" he said. [Austin worked with
allies to increase cooperation across the region]{.underline}. His stop
in Bangkok is another piece of this effort to increase cooperation
across the region. The United States military is working with
Thailand\'s forces to modernize the military. Discussions centered on
this and increasing the complexity of an already large exercise program
headlined by the Cobra Gold series. Now, the secretary will travel to
Brussels for the defense ministerial --- the last such meeting before
the NATO Summit in Madrid that begins June 28. While the ministerial is
important \"my first order of business will be convening the Ukraine
defense contact group for the third time,\" Austin said. \"That\'s going
to be an important opportunity to gather our growing group of partners
from around the world to ensure that we\'re providing Ukraine, what
Ukraine needs right now in order to defend against Russia\'s
unjustified, unprovoked assault.\" The group will also look at what
Ukraine will need in the long run to build and sustain defenses.
\"We\'ll hear directly from the Ukrainian leaders, led by my good friend
and counterpart Oleksii Reznikov, and we\'ll work to intensify our
shared efforts to meet Ukraine\'s priority requirements to defend
itself,\" he said. **[The bottom line to all this is that the United
States can deal in two theaters and with two competitors and then
some]{.underline}**. [He said the number of operations, exercises and
training events that the U.S. has conducted with Indo-Pacific allies and
partners over the past year \"\... is impressive in and of
itself.\"]{.underline} Austin continued, \"But by the same time, we\'ve
been able to not only to help to unify NATO, we\'ve also led the effort
to rapidly rush much needed security assistance to Ukraine with the help
of allies and partners,\" he continued. President Joe Biden has been
instrumental in solidifying NATO and other nations opposition to
Vladimir Putin\'s unjust war --- first by sharing intelligence openly
about Russia\'s intentions and then in his quick response to the
invasion itself, Austin said. \"\[NATO\] is more united than I\'ve seen
it, and I\'ve been associated with NATO since ... 1975 when Lieutenant
Austin first started down that road,\" he said. \"So, we are walking and
chewing gum. And we\'re able to do that because the strong network of
alliances and partnerships that we have around the globe.\"

#### The US can focus on both regions at once

**Kroenig '22**, deputy director of the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft
Center for Strategy and Security and a professor in the Department of
Government and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at
Georgetown University (Matthew, "Washington Must Prepare for War With
Both Russia and China," *Foreign Policy*,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/18/us-russia-china-war-nato-quadrilateral-security-dialogue/)//BB>

As Russia threatens the largest land invasion in Europe since World War
II, the most consequential strategic question of the 21st century is
becoming clear: [How can the United States]{.underline}
[manage]{.underline} two revisionist, autocratic, nuclear-armed great
powers ([Russia and China]{.underline}) [simultaneously?]{.underline}
[The answer, according to many]{.underline} politicians and [defense
experts, is that Washington must moderate its response to Russia in
Europe to focus on]{.underline} the greater threat posed by
[China]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific. **[This would be a
mistake]{.underline}**. **[The United States]{.underline}** remains the
world's leading power with global interests, and it **[cannot afford to
choose between Europe and the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. Instead,
[Washington]{.underline} and its allies [should develop a defense
strategy capable of deterring and, if necessary, defeating Russia and
China at the same time]{.underline}. In recent weeks, Biden has sent
several thousand U.S. troops to reinforce NATO's eastern flank---and for
good reason. A major war in Ukraine could spill across international
boundaries and threaten the seven NATO allies that border Russia,
Belarus, and Ukraine. Moreover, if Russian President Vladimir Putin
succeeds in Ukraine, why would he stop there? Putin has shown a clear
interest in resurrecting the former Russian Empire, and other vulnerable
Eastern European countries---Poland, Romania, or the Baltic
states---might be next. A successful Russian incursion into a NATO
ally's territory could mean the end of the Western alliance and the
credibility of U.S. security commitments globally. The threat posed by
China is also serious. Adm. Philip Davidson, former commander of U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command, predicted China could invade Taiwan within the
next six years. This is a war the United States might lose. If China
succeeds in taking Taiwan, it would be well on its way to disrupting the
U.S.-led order in Asia, with an eye to doing the same globally.
Moreover, Russia and China are increasingly working together. As this
month's summit between Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping shows,
Moscow and Beijing are forging a closer strategic partnership, including
on military matters. These dictators could coordinate dual attacks on
the U.S. alliance structure or opportunistically seize on the
distraction provided by the other's aggression. In other words, there is
a serious risk of simultaneous major-power wars in both Europe and the
Indo-Pacific. To address this problem, many have proposed answers that
simply will not work. The Biden administration initially hoped to put
relations with Russia on a "stable and predictable" footing to focus on
China, but Putin had other ideas, as the world is now seeing in Ukraine.
Unfortunately, Washington does not get to decide how its adversaries
sequence their aggression. Others have expressed hope that Washington
can peel these powers apart or even align with Russia against China, but
these are not realistic solutions. The misguided view gaining the most
recent acceptance, however, is that Washington should simply choose the
Indo-Pacific over Europe. Politicians and experts argue that the United
States lacks the resources to take on both Russia and China. They point
to China's power and Asia's wealth and argue that Asia should be the
priority. While Washington pivots to Asia, wealthy European countries,
such as Germany, should step up to provide for NATO's defense. Indeed,
the Biden administration's National Defense Strategy, which has been
delayed due to the Ukraine crisis, is expected to focus on China without
offering a clear solution to the two-front-war problem. A good strategy
starts with clear goals---and Washington's objectives are to maintain
peace and stability in both Europe and Asia. [A good
strategy]{.underline}, however, [starts with clear goals, and
Washington's objectives are to maintain peace and stability in **both**
Europe and Asia]{.underline}. U[.S. interests in Europe are too
significant to let them be worked out solely between Putin and the
United States' European allies]{.underline}. Indeed, the European Union,
not Asia, is the United States' largest trade and investment partner,
and this imbalance is much starker when China (which the United States
seeks greater economic decoupling from), is removed from the equation.
Furthermore, China has conducted military exercises in Europe and the
Middle East. Competing with China militarily means competing globally,
not just in Asia. In addition, Xi is gauging U.S. resolve, and a weak
response in Ukraine might make a Chinese move on Taiwan more likely.
Moreover, [**the United States is not France**; it is **not compelled**
to make gut-wrenching strategic choices about its national security due
to constrained resources]{.underline}. In short, publishing [a defense
strategy that can only handle one of the United States' great-power
rivals]{.underline} (which is what is expected from the forthcoming
national defense strategy) [is planning to fail]{.underline}.

### Asia Pivot Bad

#### Pivot to Europe solves Russia war, pivot to Asia causes it

**McKinley '22** (Michael, non-resident senior adviser at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, "It's Time to Pivot Back to
Europe," Politico, 2-24-2022,
<https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/24/its-time-to-pivot-back-to-europe-00011324>)

President Vladimir Putin's recognition of the separatist republics of
Luhansk and Donetsk, which opened the door to the wider assault on
Ukraine that is now underway, is a game-changer on a historic scale. It
underscores, like nothing else, that the drift away from Europe by the
United States over the past 20 years in pursuit of wars and priorities
elsewhere has been short-sighted. Like 1949, the year in which the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization came into being, [America and its European
allies are facing a moment requiring a profound redefinition of their
security, political and economic ties]{.underline}. Going forward,
[a]{.underline} strategic, not tactical, [pivot back to Europe **should
be the driving imperative** of American foreign policy]{.underline}. In
doing so, it is important to accept reality: Putin called the bluff of
the not-very-collected West, which was equivocating by placing only
selective sanctions on Russia for its virtual annexation of part of
Ukraine. Putin is unlikely to be deterred by a staggered escalation of
these measures meant to allow room for him to change course: He is dead
set on achieving at least a partial reconstitution of the Russian empire
as he sees it and forcing the creation of a new security architecture
for Europe. Putin's words need to be taken seriously instead of being
dismissed as ramblings or misleading. For all the lingering suggestions
that there is still time for diplomacy, Putin could not have been
clearer this week that he was also setting the stage for more aggressive
steps in the very near future. He even raised a non-existent nuclear
threat to Russia from a NATO-dominated Ukraine and again dismissed
Ukrainian national identity as a fiction. Arriving at this point, too
many commentators and politicians spent months resorting to dismissive
rhetoric about Putin even as he outmaneuvered Western leaders. They
belittled Russia --- as a declining power, a declining economy and as a
nation fearful of democratization on its borders. They argued that the
United States and NATO allies could force Putin to rethink his actions
--- even though there has been no sign of him reconsidering course. Some
argued that Putin would not risk war given the likely costs. It is now
possible to see the limits of their world view. The inviolability of a
nation's sovereignty and its right to decide its own security alliances
have also been presented as self-evident truths. In the case of Ukraine,
however, many of us side-stepped uncomfortable questions about why NATO
did not invite the country to join, and about the precedents set for
Finland and Austria after World War II to ensure their neutrality. A now
prophetic article by Henry Kissinger in 2014 makes it clear that
something like the neutrality option would have been a more desirable
outcome for Ukraine and reflected the reality of Ukraine's situation.
The West will find it difficult to break the momentum that Russia is
building, or to reverse the new realities Putin is creating.
[Russia]{.underline} may not be a colossus, but it remains one of the
most powerful countries in the world, with a nuclear arsenal, a
modernized military and a serious player in international oil and gas
markets. It [cannot]{.underline}, in other words, [be dismissed only as
a "regional power threatening its neighbors out of
weakness,"]{.underline} and while it is becoming an outright
dictatorship by smothering democracy at home, that is not a central
concern in the current crisis. [Russia can project its military
globally]{.underline} --- as its interventions in Syria and elsewhere
have shown. [It can wage cyberattacks on Europe and the United States
with relative impunity]{.underline}. Putin has triumphed in political
showdowns with leaders like Turkey's President Erdogan and, even as
Russia's relationship with Europe in general turns adversarial, the
likes of Serbia and NATO member Hungary appear more sympathetic to
Putin. World leaders until last week came to Putin as he limited his own
international travel --- and gave little away. Russia's diplomatic
fortunes are hardly crumbling elsewhere, as evidenced by a rising
entente between China and Russia --- aligned in their security interests
against perceived Western encroachment. There is another factor at work,
and that is that Putin's view of history, often seen as opportunistic,
does appear to be a primary driver of his actions. And it is not his
worldview alone. The incorporation of Russian-speaking populations
inside neighboring borders after 1991 remains an issue for nationalists
in Moscow; and the West has systematically downplayed how NATO expansion
since 1997 has looked to a generation of Russian leaders, and not just
President Putin. It is not dovish, as a recent New Yorker article
suggested, or appeasement as a British defense minister stated, to take
these perceptions into account in the current crisis. The deep
undercurrents of historical myth drive almost every nation into
destructive paths. It is in this context that the United States and its
allies have chosen to draw a line in the sand over a further Russian
military intervention in Ukraine which has now materialized on a major
scale. The relative success of President Joe Biden in preserving a
united front with European allies on a gradual escalation of sanctions
masks the lingering challenges of fully cohering on strategy. There have
been differences between the responses by the United States and Britain
on the one hand; the French and the Germans on another; and disparate
governments like Italy (opposed to energy sanctions as late as this past
weekend) and Hungary (offering veiled sympathy to Russia's demands).
French President Emmanuel Macron until recently was openly discussing
the need for a new security architecture for Europe. Chancellor Olaf
Scholz of Germany told national reporters on his return from Moscow that
"we just can't have a possible military conflict over a question that is
not on the agenda" regarding Ukraine's future membership in NATO. As EU
foreign ministers met in Brussels this week, there were continued
differences between those arguing for "incrementalism" on sanctions like
Germany and Italy, and those wanting a more forceful response. There may
be greater unity now as the scale of the Russian invasion becomes clear,
but the proof will only be evident in the coming days. The allies'
caution in recent days contrasted with President Zelensky's increasing
concern as options close around him. The gathering of senior NATO and EU
ministers at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 18-20, as well as
the presence of a U.S. delegation led by Vice President Kamala Harris,
did not convey the strongest confidence on an agreed approach to Russian
aggression. President Zelensky's speech at the gathering was a searing
indictment of the lack of decisiveness of Western nations over the last
many years, and Ukrainian ministers were publicly critical of the slow
pace of the imposition of sanctions since the recognition of the
separatist republics by Russia. [Western governments are now at a real,
not hypothetical crossroads]{.underline}. The invasion is underway, and
Putin would appear to be achieving his long-stated objectives, some of
which he began to make clear 15 years ago in a speech to the 2007 Munich
Security Conference. He has torn up the 2015 Minsk agreement which was
meant to be the foundation for talks between Ukraine and Russia
regarding the future of the Donbas. Putin is calculating he can survive
sanctions for an indefinite period as he builds a significant war chest
of foreign reserves. He is also betting on a swifter and easier military
victory in Ukraine than Western analysts are predicting. If either of
these scenarios were to hold, NATO, EU and American threats or actions
would end up ringing hollow to most of the rest of the world. Putin, in
short, means to complete what he has started, and more. As Lithuanian
Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis suggested, Ukraine may not be
the end of the story, and Belarus' renewed and total subservience to
Moscow can, in retrospect, be seen as prelude to Putin's attempt to do
the same to Ukraine. In responding to Russia's expanding aggression in
Ukraine, Western nations will build towards ever more severe sanctions.
There will be United Nations resolutions and condemnations. Russian
oligarchs may lose their right to residence and investment in London and
Paris. Nord Stream 2 is being suspended and may be canceled. NATO may be
strengthened; European members may finally spend 2 percent of their GDP
on defense. NATO may accelerate military assistance to Ukraine or arm an
insurgency in Ukraine in the future. The broader international community
may be galvanized into supporting harsher measures to punish Russia
depending on the scale of the conflict. Longer-term, however, the latest
developments suggest it is time to rethink the West's approach to the
next phase of dealing with Putin. That will entail recognizing that the
security landscape of Europe is being changed as we watch, in real time,
and is unlikely to be turned back to what it was any time soon. The
response must stop Russia from destroying the post-World War II
architecture that has largely preserved peace for 70 years. Doing so
will require another historic decision and response. [We need to
revitalize NATO and the transatlantic economic and political relations
which have been **weakened for two decades as the United States
prioritized Asia**]{.underline}, abandoned trade agreements, diverted
NATO to fight wars farther afield and allowed allies to take for granted
the alliance's centrality to their own collective defense. In the
process, we may rediscover that [the future of the United States is
still **most fundamentally impacted by what happens in
Europe**]{.underline}.

#### Asia pivot breaks NATO

[The US focus on China is controversial]{.underline}, in part, [because
it comes at a moment when relations between NATO and Russia are severely
strained. NATO's Eastern European members don't want China to
"overshadow" concerns about Russia]{.underline}. Multiple Eastern
European states have competed for additional US forces ---though to
little avail. Poland even offered, in 2018, to name a military base
after President Donald Trump. Now, **[NATO waits]{.underline}** for the
US Global Posture Review, which will provide guidance
**[on]{.underline}** how best to allocate **[US military resources going
forward]{.underline}**. The review will be heavily scrutinized. [If it
re-aligns US military resources towards East Asia, the **cracks in NATO
may continue to grow**]{.underline}.

### Europe Focus Solve China

#### Europe is a key counterbalance against Chinese leadership

[The United States needs **Europe to be peaceful** because it needs NATO
and the EU to be productive]{.underline}. [The size of Europe's economy
makes it an important **counterbalance to China**]{.underline}'s growth.
British, French, and Spanish ties with Africa are important in pushing
back against China's growing influence in the continent. European
universities still produce stellar research which is crucial in the
technological competition with China. [Each of Europe's strengths in a
competition with China also makes it an important region in its own
right]{.underline}. [With three-quarters of a billion people, it is an
important trade partner and plays a key role in the American economy. It
is home to many U.S. military bases used for important
missions]{.underline}, most recently during the evacuation from
Afghanistan. Its scientific and technological achievements contribute to
American prosperity---the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that the president of
the United States and millions of others recieved would not have been
made without German partnership. **[America can't afford to take Europe
for granted]{.underline}** anymore. They need us and **[we need
them]{.underline}**. The hard part of alliance management is supposed to
be responding to the needs, wants, and objectives, and insecurities of
the other side. But lately, the United States has had more trouble
figuring out what its own needs, wants, and objectives in Europe
are---or if it has any at all.

Union Cold War, and that a **hot war might break out** between the two.
This argument is **unconvincing**]{.underline}. **[First]{.underline}**
of all, [**deterrents** to a flare-up are]{.underline} much
**[strong]{.underline}**er [**in US-China relations** than in US-Soviet
relations]{.underline}. Although economic and people-to-people ties
between China and the US are declining, they are still close compared to
US-Soviet ties. [It is **hard to decouple** two **closely intertwined
economies** and **societies**.]{.underline} Take two examples. [China is
expected to become the world\'s **largest consumer market**, a
temptation **hard to resist** for exporters, **including** those from
the US. And in **education**, more than **300,000 Chinese students**
study in the US, bringing in **huge revenues** for the US education
industry]{.underline}. Many universities go to great lengths to woo
international students. Recently Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology even sued the government over its new visa restrictions,
now aborted, on international students. [Second, **even if** there is
decoupling, the pain would **not be too great** and can be **kept out**
of the **national security sphere**]{.underline} if properly handled. In
fact, for national security reasons, a modest degree of isolation will
make both sides more secure and comfortable. For instance, if China's
information technology equipment cannot capture Western markets, the US
will be more relaxed. If China cannot get advanced technologies from the
US and its technological progress slows down, the US will be less
anxious. In the same vein, China feels assured knowing that if the Trump
administration does impose a travel ban on Communist Party members, it
would be abandoning one of the tools available to the US to promote
"peaceful evolution" in China. Economic decoupling is undeniably more
painful for China than for the US. But unlike Japan during WWII, which
was hit hard by the US oil embargo because of its lack of natural
resources, China has no such problems. Given its large domestic market,
losing the US as a major customer is not a disaster for China, and can
be compensated through more dynamic economic activities at home. China
can also make up for being freezed out of technological exchanges by
turning to indigenous innovation. As for the US, it can import goods
from other developing countries, albeit less cheaply. The relative loss
is acceptable when weighed against the heightened perception of economic
independence and security. [Third, the ideological confrontation between
China and the US is **less intense**]{.underline} than that during the
Cold War. Unlike the obsession with ideology in those days, [the line
between capitalism and socialism is **blurred** today. The **market
economy** has become **universally recognised** as the best way to
promote economic growth]{.underline} and, politically, many countries
have embraced democracy. Even North Korea calls itself the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea. Although ideological hawks in the US still
long for the day when the beacon of freedom will light up the world,
[after **many years** of fighting **bloody wars overseas**, most
American people are **not interested** in promoting democracy
abroad]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [China just wants to **preserve its
political system** and has **no interest in exporting it** to other
countries, as the Soviet Union did. Thus, ideological **antagonism** in
China-US relations can easily be **eased** by calculations of realistic
**interests**, which create conditions for **compromise and
cooperation**. **Fourth**, both China and the US have **many options
other than war** to achieve their policy goals]{.underline}. While they
have no allies to serve as a buffer, given the nature of the potential
conflict in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, [both countries are
**adept at operating in grey zones** and fighting psychological, public
opinion or diplomatic warfare **below the threshold of
war**]{.underline}. The forced closure of the Chinese consulate in
Houston by the US government is just the latest act of brinkmanship. In
addition, [given China's huge economic and financial interests in the
US, the latter can **wield the stick of sanctions** when use of force is
**highly risky** or not worth it.]{.underline} [When both sides have
**many tools and options,** why would they **rush to war** to achieve
their goals? **Last**]{.underline} but not least, [the **imbalance of
power** will act as a deterrent]{.underline}. Some say the US and Soviet
Union did not fight a hot war because they were evenly matched. It was
not the case, actually. At the beginning of the Cold War, the Soviet
Union was at a relative military disadvantage. Moreover, [a country
needs the **will to fight** before **going to war,** even if it is
stronger militarily than its adversary. Having fought **years of
meaningless wars**, the US is **weary of war**]{.underline}. [China,
too, **abhors war**. Having a **clear understanding** of US strength,
**especially** when its own economy is **slowing down** and it is facing
**various domestic challenges**]{.underline}, [China would **not wish**
to **recklessly start a war with the US**. In summary, the possibility
of a **hot war** between China and the US is **very
small**]{.underline}. The greatest danger for China is not a cold or hot
confrontation with the US, but policymakers' interpretation of the
momentary hostility towards Beijing of a portion of the American
population and the larger world. An erroneous interpretation could end
China's march to further opening up, and see it turn instead towards
self-isolation.

#### No US-China war -- nuclear deterrence and geographic factors

**Keck 17** (Zachary, Wohlstetter Public Affairs Fellow at the
Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, former researcher at the

America Probably Won\'t Go to War", The National Interest, 8-26-2017,

//ghs-ag

In recent years, many observers have woken up to the fact that [a war
between the United States and China is not unthinkable. Although this is
true, there are still strong pacifying forces]{.underline}. **[Two
factors strike me as the most important. The first]{.underline}**, and
most obvious one**[, is that [both sides maintain secure nuclear
arsenals]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As Thomas Schelling and others have
pointed out, [nuclear weapons are not a game-changer]{.underline} simply
[because of their massive destructive capabilities]{.underline}. [The
speed and certainty]{.underline} of nuclear retaliation is just as
important. These two characteristics [simply aren't present with
conventional weapons]{.underline}. Leaders can delude themselves into
thinking their conventional forces, however improbably, will end up
victorious in battle. In any case, the consequences of being wrong are
far in the future. For instance, Imperial Japanese leaders knew it was a
tremendous gamble to take on the United States. Isoroku Yamamoto, the
Japanese admiral who planned Pearl Harbor, warned his civilian
leadership beforehand: "In the first six to twelve months of a war with
the United States and Great Britain I will run wild and win victory upon
victory. But then, if the war continues after that, I have no
expectation of success." After the American economic embargo, however,
Japanese leaders were only faced with bad options: capitulating in the
face of American pressure or fighting a more powerful enemy in a likely
futile effort. In these circumstances, Tokyo decided to gamble. After
all, it was conceivable that America would be so exhausted from fighting
Nazi Germany in Europe that it would ultimately sue for peace in Asia,
especially in the face of fierce Japanese resistance. Can America and
Its Allies \"Play Fort\" against China Deadly Missiles? While the
outcome of conventional wars hinges on a number of unknowable factors,
nuclear retaliation is certain. And, [unlike with conventional
weapons]{.underline}---especially before airplanes and missiles---[[one
doesn't have to defeat the other side's military to wreak havoc on its
cities]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nuclear weapons can do so immediately.
Moreover, as Robert Jervis points out , [when two countries with secure,
thermonuclear arsenals go to war, "the side that is 'losing' the war as
judged by various measures of military capability can inflict as much
destruction on the side that is 'winning' as the 'winner' can on the
'loser.]{.underline}'" This changes the calculation of leaders, and
makes it inconceivable that rational leaders would opt for total war.
This is not foolproof of course--- there is still the possibility that
miscalculations, gradual escalation, or the "threats that leave
something to chance" will produce an outcome neither side wanted--- but
**[[it is a strong incentive for peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [While it
is]{.underline} widely [recognized that nuclear weapons make a
U.S.-China conflict less likely]{.underline}, the pacifying effect of
geography is often overlooked. Geography works to attenuate tensions in
two interrelated ways. First, b[oth China and the United States are
massive countries that would be extremely difficult to conquer and
occupy]{.underline}. [Second, [both are separated by the largest ocean
on earth]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and it is extremely difficult to
project power over large bodies of water. As John Mearsheimer has
written : "[When great powers are separated]{.underline} by large bodies
of water, [they usually do not have much offensive capability against
each other, regardless of the relative size of their
armies]{.underline}. Large bodies of water are formidable obstacles that
cause significant power-projection problems for attacking armies."
[These two geographical factors reduce the intensity of the]{.underline}
so-called security [dilemma]{.underline}. Despite all their disputes
over issues like Taiwan and the East and South China Seas, **[[China and
the United States generally do not have to fear that the other side will
seek to invade and conquer them]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This has usually
not been the case for rising and ruling powers that went to war. In many
of these instances, the rivals were located on the same continent or
even shared a border, which generated significant insecurity and led to
conflict. As Mearsheimer again explains , "Great powers located on the
same landmass are in a much better position to attack and conquer each
other. That is especially true of states that share a common border.
Therefore, [great powers separated by water are likely to fear each
other less than great powers that can get at each other over
land]{.underline}."

### [No Taiwan War]{.underline}

#### PLA doesn't have the capability to invade Taiwan

Ben **Westcott '19** is a Digital News Producer based in Hong Kong, who
joined CNN in 2016. He writes about China, Australia and Indonesia, June
24^th^, 2019, "A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be a bloody,
logistical nightmare" from
https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/23/asia/taiwan-china-invasion-intl-hnk/index.html,
accessed 7/5/19 \|\| OES-AT

Roaring out of the sky, an F-16V fighter jet lands smoothly to rearm and
refuel on an unremarkable freeway in rural Taiwan, surrounded by rice
paddies. ¶ In different circumstances, this could be alarming sight.
Taiwan\'s fighter pilots are trained to land on freeways between sorties
in case all of the island\'s airports have been occupied or destroyed by
an invasion. ¶ Luckily, this was a training exercise. ¶ [There\'s only
really one enemy that Taiwan\'s armed forces are preparing to resist \--
China\'s People\'s Liberation Army (PLA).]{.underline} And as China\'s
reputation as an economic and military superpower has grown in recent
years, so too has that threat of invasion, according to security
experts. ¶ Taiwan has been self-governed since separating from China at
the end of a brutal civil war in 1949, but Beijing has never given up
hope of reuniting with what it considers a renegade province. ¶ At a
regional security conference in June, Chinese Defense Minister Wei
Fenghe said: \"[If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese
military has no choice but to fight at all costs for national
unity.\"]{.underline} In some shops in mainland China, you can buy
postcards and T-shirts emblazoned with patriotic emblems promoting the
retaking of Taiwan. ¶ But for seven decades, **[[China has resisted
attacking Taiwan partly for political reasons, including the prospect of
a US intervention and the potential heavy human
toll.]{.underline}]{.mark}** But the [practical realities of a
full-blown invasion are also daunting for the PLA, according to
experts]{.underline}. ¶ Ferrying hundreds of thousands of troops across
the narrow Taiwan Strait to a handful of reliable landing beaches, in
the face of fierce resistance, is a harrowing prospect. [[Troops would
then have a long slog over Taiwan\'s western mudflats and mountains to
reach the capital]{.mark}, Taipei.]{.underline} ¶ Not only that, but
[China would face an opponent who has been preparing for war for almost
70 years]{.underline}. ¶ At mass anti-invasion drills in May, Taiwan
military spokesman Maj. Gen. Chen Chung-Chi said the island knew it had
to always be \"combat-ready.\" ¶ \"Of course, we don\'t want war, but
only by gaining our own strength can we defend ourselves,\" he said.
\"If China wants to take any action against us, it has to consider
paying a painful price.\" ¶ Difficult and bloody ¶ [It could be easy to
assume that any invasion of Taiwan by Beijing would be brief and
devastating for Taipei]{.underline}: a David and Goliath fight between a
tiny island and the mainland\'s military might, population and wealth. ¶
With nearly 1.4 billion people, the People\'s Republic of China has the
largest population in the world. Taiwan has fewer than 24 million people
\-- a similar number to Australia. China has the fifth largest territory
in the world, while Taiwan is the size of Denmark or the US state of
Maryland. And Beijing runs an economy that is second only to the United
States, while Taiwan\'s doesn\'t rank in the world\'s top 20. ¶ But
perhaps most pertinently, China has been building and modernizing its
military at an unprecedented rate, while Taiwan relies on moderate US
arms sales. ¶ In sheer size, the PLA simply dwarfs Taiwan\'s military. ¶
China has an estimated 1 million troops, almost 6,000 tanks, 1,500
fighter jets and 33 navy destroyers, according to the latest US Defense
Department report. Taiwan\'s ground force troops barely number 150,000
and are backed by 800 tanks and about 350 fighter aircraft, the report
found, while its navy fields only four destroyer-class ships. ¶ Under
Chinese President Xi Jinping, the PLA has rapidly modernized, buoyed by
rises in military spending and crackdowns on corruption in the army\'s
leadership. ¶ \"China\'s leaders hope that possessing these military
capabilities will deter pro-independence moves by Taiwan or, should
deterrence fail, will permit a range of tailored military options
against Taiwan and potential third-party military intervention,\"
according to a 2019 US Defense Intelligence Agency report on China\'s
military. ¶ [Yet while China hawks in the media might beat the drum of
invasion, an internal China military study, seen by CNN, revealed that
the **[PLA considers an invasion of Taiwan to be extremely
difficul]{.mark}t**]{.underline}. ¶ \"[[Taiwan has a professional
military]{.mark}, with a strong core of American-trained
experts,\"]{.underline} said Ian Easton, author of \"The Chinese
Invasion Threat\" and research fellow at the Project 2049 Institute, as
well as \"highly defensible\" terrain. ¶ In his book he described an
invasion by China as \"the most difficult and bloody mission facing the
Chinese military.\" ¶ The plan to take Taiwan ¶ China\'s Taiwan invasion
plan, known internally as the \"Joint Island Attack Campaign,\" would
begin with a mass, coordinated bombing of Taiwan\'s vital infrastructure
\-- ports and airfields \-- to cripple the island\'s military ahead of
an amphibious invasion, according to both Easton and Sidharth Kaushal, a
research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and
Security Studies. ¶ At the same time, the Chinese air force would fly
over the Taiwan Strait and try to dominate the island\'s air space. Once
the PLA was satisfied it had suitably disabled Taiwan\'s air and naval
forces, Kaushal said soldiers would begin to invade on the west coast of
the island. ¶ The island\'s rocky, mountainous east coast is considered
too inhospitable and far from mainland China. ¶ The amphibious invasion
needed to put troops on Taiwan, however, could be the biggest hurdle
facing the PLA. ¶ In its 2019 report to Congress, the US Department of
Defense said China \-- which has one of the largest navies in Asia \--
had at its command 37 amphibious transport docks and 22 smaller landing
ships, as well as any civilian vessels Beijing could enlist. ¶ That
might be enough to occupy smaller islands, such as those in the South
China Sea, but [an amphibious [assault]{.mark} on Taiwan [would likely
require a bigger arsena]{.mark}]{.underline}[l]{.mark} \-- and there is
\"no indication China is significantly expanding its landing ship
force,\" the report said. ¶ That makes it vital for Beijing to
neutralize Taiwan\'s navy and air force in the early stages of an
attack, Kaushal said. ¶ \"The Taiwanese air force would have to sink
around 40% of the amphibious landing forces of the PLA in order to
render this sort of mission infeasible,\" he said. ¶ Essentially,
that\'s only about 10 to 15 ships, he added. ¶ If they did make it
across the strait, [the [PLA]{.mark} would still [need]{.mark} to find a
decent [landing spot]{.mark} for its ships]{.underline}. ¶ China\'s
military would be looking for a landing site both close to the mainland,
and a strategic city, such as Taipei, with nearby port and airport
facilities. ¶ That leaves just 14 potential beaches, Easton said \-- and
it\'s not only the PLA that knows it. Taiwanese engineers have spent
decades digging tunnels and bunkers in potential landing zones along the
coast. ¶ Furthermore, [the backbone of [Taiwan\'s defense is]{.mark} a
fleet of vessels [capable of launching anti-ship cruise missiles, on top
of an array of ground-based missiles, and substantial mines and
artillery]{.mark} on the coastline.]{.underline} ¶ \"Taiwan\'s entire
national defense strategy, including its war plans, are specifically
targeted at defeating a PLA invasion,\" Easton said. ¶ Chinese troops
could be dropped in from the air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA
makes it unlikely. ¶ [If the PLA held a position on Taiwan, and could
reinforce with troops from the mainland to face off about 150,000 Taiwan
troops, as]{.underline} well as more than 2.5 million reservists, it
would have to push through the island\'s western mud flats and
mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, towards Taipei. ¶
Finally, the mobilization of amphibious landing vessels, ballistic
missile launchers, fighters and bombers, as well as hundreds of
thousands of troops, would give Taiwan plenty of advance warning of any
attack, Kaushal said. ¶ \"It\'s extremely unlikely that the invasion
could come as a bolt from the blue,\" Kaushal added. ¶ There is, of
course, [one final deterrent to any PLA invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}.
¶ It isn\'t clear whether or not such an attack by China would spark an
intervention by the United States on Taipei\'s behalf. ¶ Washington has
been a longtime ally of the island, selling weapons to the Taiwan
government and providing implicit military protection from Beijing. ¶
Easton said that, at present, the US would likely intervene in Taiwan\'s
favor, both to protect investment by US companies on the island and
reassure American allies in the region, who are also facing down a
resurgent PLA in the East and South China seas. ¶ Collin Koh Swee Lean,
research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies\'
Maritime Security Program in Singapore, said there would also be
\"immense political consequences\" from taking over Taiwan, in the event
of a successful China invasion. ¶ \"It will likely mean that China will
be seen as the bad guy in the neighborhood, who uses force,\" he said.
\"It will alienate some regional partners and the good will which China
has been trying to build over the years will evaporate. And it will set
China on a collision course with the US.\" ¶ But Taipei isn\'t taking
anything for granted. ¶ On the sidelines of the massive Han Guang
drills, Taiwan\'s Maj. Gen. Chen pointed out the hundreds of spectators
who had come out to watch and support the island\'s military. ¶ \"These
exercises let people know the national army of the Republic of China is
ready,\" he said. ¶ Taiwan is taking no chances.

#### Trade ties make closer Taiwanese ties with China inevitable

**Chen 19** (Dr. Charles I-hsin Chen is Executive Director of the
Institute for Taiwan-America Studies at Washington D.C., The Diplomat,
6-14-2019, \"Why the US May Lose Taiwan to Beijing Economically,\"
Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2019/06/why-the-us-may-lose-taiwan-to-beijing-economically/)SEM

In March 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the House
Foreign Affairs Committee that China is a threat to the United States.
"This is a great power battle and we're engaged in it across the world,"
he added. [China now challenges American influence in]{.underline} all
aspects, and [Taiwan]{.underline} represents a frontier in this hybrid
competition. While the island's security still relies heavily on
Washington's guarantees, **[there's a rising risk that the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [may]{.mark} [lose Taiwan to Beijing
economically]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} There are three reasons
for this trend. A Drifting Taiwan The first is Taiwan's drift.
[[Taiwan's trade dependency]{.mark} on the United States was largely
[replaced by]{.mark} dependency on [China]{.mark} after
2001]{.underline}, when both Taiwan and China entered the World Trade
Organization (WTO). The share of Taiwan's total trade involving the
United States halved, falling from 23 percent to 12 percent, from 1998
to 2018, while [[China's share doubled from 15 to 31]{.mark}
percent]{.underline}. In January 2017, Taiwan adopted a New Southbound
Policy (NSP) attempting to divert the island's exports away from China
and into South and Southeast Asia, but without concrete results.
[Taiwan's export reliance on China increased 2 percentage points to 41
percent in 2018, peaking historically at 45 percent]{.underline} that
March, while the export share to the 18 countries covered in the NSP
decreased by 1 percentage point in the same period. Simply put, this new
policy did not work well. Even worse, [Taiwan's global strategy is not
leading anywhere]{.underline}. There are two groups of regional
integration emerging around Taiwan, but the island is unlikely to enter
either. First, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP),
which targets 16 Asia-Pacific countries, including China, would require
Taiwan to join as a province of China --- a condition Taiwan simply
cannot accept. Second is the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for
Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which includes 11 Trans-Pacific
countries, now led by Japan after the withdrawal of the United States.
However, China may also block Taiwan by pressuring its partners to veto
any Taiwanese bid to join. The alternative for Taiwan to promote its
trade relations is to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with major
economies. Yet the political issue of the status of Taiwan would halt
most negotiations in the first round. Unfortunately, [Taiwan's economy
is drifting to the middle of nowhere]{.underline}. A Pulling China The
second factor is China's pull. [**[China's economic attraction for
Taiwan is growing at both the regional and local levels]{.mark}.**
China's GDP per capita has increased nine times]{.underline} on a
purchasing-power-parity basis [since 1990. This formed a strong economic
gravity pulling all neighboring economies into China's orbit --- and
particularly Taiwan]{.underline}, which is just 100 nautical miles off
the mainland's southeast coast. [China now is capable of offering
**lucrative incentives** to convert the loyalty of its commercial allies
as the]{.underline} existing economic hegemon --- namely, the [United
States]{.underline} --- [is in relative decline]{.underline}. For
example, some [Eurasian leaders]{.underline} in developing or
underdeveloped countries may [see China's Belt and Road Initiative as a
good opportunity. They may also feel that the]{.underline} Chinese-led
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ([AIIB) is more accessible than
the]{.underline} American-led [World Bank]{.underline} in granting big
loans for development projects. [At the local level, China's economic
influence on Taiwan specifically has become more **tangible and
comprehensive**]{.underline}. Since the late 1980s, Taiwanese investment
had been lured by preferential policies from Chinese central and local
governments. As of last year, the total amount of [Taiwanese investment
in China has accumulated to \$180 billion]{.underline} --- 10 times the
Taiwanese investment in the United States in the same period. As a
result, over [400,000 Taiwanese quality managers and talents are
currently working and living in Chinese cities]{.underline} with their
family members. The total number may surpass 2 million people, close to
one-tenth of Taiwan's population. In terms of cross-strait relations,
[the two sides of the Taiwan Strait resumed warm ties in 2008 and
reached 23 agreements during Ma Ying-jeou's presidency]{.underline}. Yet
the official channel of dialogue was suspended after President Tsai
Ing-wen's inauguration in May 2016. Beijing began to unilaterally
conduct cross-strait affairs without prior consultation or negotiation
with Taipei. Even while cross-strait tensions rose, [in January 2018,
quasi-citizenship was granted to Taiwanese living, studying, or working
in China and some national treatments involving subsidies or bank loans
were opened to Taiwanese enterprises. [Beijing's carrot-and-stick
approach towards Taiwan remains, and **the carrot is growing
sweeter**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} A Pushing America Meanwhile, [the
United States risks pushing Taiwan away]{.underline}. President Donald
[Trump's Taiwan policy]{.underline}, if there is one, [has been
inconsistent between political and economic affairs since 2017. In
politics, the United States has strengthened its security commitment to
Taiwan to tackle the escalating tension in the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}. The new Taiwan Travel Act, taking effect in March
2018, encouraged more frequent and higher level official exchanges
between Washington and Taipei. To maintain Taiwan's capacity of
self-defense, informal notification of a \$2 billion [sale
of]{.underline} 108 M1A2 tanks and [weapons was sent to the U.S.
Congress]{.underline} in early June. Another, bigger package ---
possibly including 66 F-16V fighter jets --- may also seek Congress'
approval later this year. The Pentagon has further made naval patrols in
the Taiwan Strait a new normal to contain Beijing's maritime aggression.
Nonetheless, [**these [policy favors do not apply to the
economic]{.mark} [field]{.mark}**. While economic ties have faded in
recent years, the U.S. Trade Representative]{.underline} (USTR) [Office
did not change its tough attitude toward Taiwan]{.underline}. Its latest
annual report reiterated serious concerns over Taiwan's bans on U.S.
pork products and beef products containing ractopamine. Due to this
first priority issue, the [USTR has suspended regular trade
talks]{.underline} since October 2016, [and put on hold the initial
steps of preparing an FTA with Taiwan.]{.underline} During the APEC
summit last November, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence agreed to bring the
Taiwanese envoy's request to restart talks back to Washington but there
was no change. Apparently, the USTR is not inclined to compromise on
this issue. Another case is even more acute and embarrassing. [[Taiwan
was subjected to Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum]{.mark} imports
to the United States]{.underline} starting in March 2018, [because
Taiwanese steel products were suspected to contain China-made steel. In
response, [Taiwan]{.mark} resorted to severe measures that [restricted
its steel products]{.mark} with any content of China-made steel [from
being exported to the U.S]{.mark}. market. Taipei even launched a
self-investigation]{.underline} into dumping and government subsidies
focused on select China-made steel products sold in Taiwan from 2015 to
2017. [Embarrassingly, these extra efforts were all in vain, and Taiwan
was not included on the tariff exemption list. **While politicians in
Washington have been wooing Taiwan, their economists are sabotaging that
effort.**]{.underline}

authority**]{.underline}.25 The point is not that two wrongs make a
right; it is that [international order is **much more resilient** than
**critics seem to realize**]{.underline},26 [and it is **utopian** to
expect any **rising Great Power** to act in a way that **uniformly
satisfies** one's **moral scruples**,]{.underline} evolving, in
Friedberg's words, "into a mellow, satisfied, 'responsible' status quo
power."27 Friedberg or Harris might object that America's rise took
place in the context of a different order. This is perfectly true, but
the more important point is that the long nineteenth century
(1815--1914)---the era of America's rise---was the first iteration of
the New Peace.28 The implication is that [relative peace **can** and
**has** **coexist**ed with **limited wars**, **property** and
**territorial thefts**, acts of **coercion**, and **aggressive
assertions of status.** This does not mean any of these are
**desirable**]{.underline}--- they are [not---but it shows that they
**need not be fatal to the system**]{.underline}. [Insofar as there
**is** a lesson from that **first period** of **relative peace**, it is
that **Great Power confrontation** is the **one thing that is
fatal**]{.underline}. [Accepting this does not mean **capitulating** in
**every instance**, as implied by some]{.underline},29 [but it **does**
mean **rediscovering** the rules of **Great Power
competition**]{.underline}30 alongside the art of strategy.31 Focusing
only on areas that China's rise violates the scruples of the established
powers, moreover, downplays the extent to which [China,
**has**]{.underline}, in fact, [**conformed** to the **existing
order.**]{.underline} As a RAND Corporation report published in 2018
concludes, China has been a supporter---albeit a conditional one---of
the international order: "Since [China undertook a **policy of
international engagement**]{.underline} in the 1980s ... the level and
quality of its participation in the order rivals that of most other
states."32 The way in which **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping, following his
2017 Davos speech in defense of globalization, [has been heralded as the
**most prominent champion of international order** and **defender of
globalization**]{.underline} underscores the fact that [there are
**different elements** of this order, and that China supports **many**,
if not **most, of them**]{.underline}. [Even in places where China is
**supposedly "altering"** the current order, Beijing tends to
simultaneously **affirm that order**]{.underline}. [China's Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank]{.underline}, for instance, actually
**[mirrors existing structures]{.underline}**, and China has
intentionally copied elements and "best practices" of the World Bank and
Asian Development Bank. [China is **playing the same game**, even if it
is **seeking a bigger role within it**]{.underline}.33

### China Not a Threat

#### The US has the overwhelming military advantage

[The US military dominates the strategic, tactical, and operational
levels of warfare across the spectrum. The Pentagon is implementing
sophisticated network warfare programs]{.underline} such as the Advanced
Battle Management System, Project Convergence, and Joint All Domain
Command and Control. [China is concerned]{.underline} about the lethal
and distributed US military, equipped with a potent combination of
quantity and quality of weapon systems. [The USN surpasses the PLAN in
rapid deployment, maneuverability, and expeditionary warfare
capabilities. The overwhelming display of US military power since 1945
**is a credible deterrent for Beijing**]{.underline}. [Since the First
Gulf War, the United States has demonstrated its capability of
destroying the adversary through preemptive strikes consisting of
long-range weapon systems such as cruise missiles in the first few days
of the war, giving no time for the adversary to
retaliate]{.underline}.75 According to Taylor Fravel, **[China is not a
military superpower]{.underline}**.76 [There is not]{.underline} much
[evidence about China's plans for global military capabilities on par
with the United States. China's military power is miniscule as compared
to United States' former adversary the Soviet Union]{.underline}.
**[China's military will be thinly stretched]{.underline}** defending
the third-largest country in the world. [The top echelons of the CCP and
PLA acknowledge US military advantages]{.underline}. [Chinese
scholars]{.underline} like Xu Ruike and Sun Degang [admit]{.underline}
that [China is an economic heavyweight but is a military featherweight
and **will remain so** for the coming decades]{.underline}.77 **[US
primacy]{.underline}** in the post--Cold War world **[has prevented
World War III]{.underline}**. The two most likely contenders for
expansion, North Korea and China, have restricted their militaries
within their borders. [The United States retains **unrivaled** military
power, and China is **not in a position to challenge it**]{.underline}.

#### The US leads across all military spectrums

**Sawant** 12-13-20**21** (Mangesh, master's in international affairs
from Columbia University, where he concentrated in international
security policy, "Why China Cannot Challenge the US Military Primacy,"

Why **[China Cannot Challenge the United States]{.underline}** People's
Liberation Army ([PLA]{.underline}) [Major]{.underline} General Zhang
Shaozhong [ranked Chinese military power in 2020 in the fifth
place]{.underline} behind the United States, Russia, Britain, and
France, [while PLAN surface power was ranked in the eighth
place]{.underline} behind Japan and India. The Peoples Liberation Army
Air Force ([PLAAF]{.underline}) [was ranked seventh]{.underline} in the
world, due to its lack of fourth-generation fighter planes and high-end
drones. In General Shaozhong's view, China will become the
second-largest military power in the world only in 2049, when it
celebrates its centennial anniversary.27 The US Military as an Economic
Deterrent [The US military plays the central role of economic
deterrence]{.underline}. The Communist Party of China
([CCP]{.underline}) [gains its legitimacy from economic
development]{.underline}. [It is possible that China could target Guam
with its small fleet of]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic missiles
([ICBM]{.underline}). [However, the use of ICBMs will lead to massive
retaliatory strikes by the United States leading to total annihilation
of China's military and economic centers of gravity]{.underline}.28 The
USN Maritime Strike Tomahawk Cruise Missile Block V will destroy coastal
cities like Shanghai, obliterating China's hi-tech industries in a
matter of hours. The CCP leadership is inexperienced in nuclear matters
as it lacks exposure to a nuclear warfare strategy as practiced by the
United States and Russia. [China's nuclear policy is based on low-level
deterrence, "minimum deterrence," and its nuclear arsenal remains small
and vulnerable]{.underline}.29 **[Threatening the United
States]{.underline}** with 200 nuclear weapons **[is not an
option]{.underline}**. Geographically, the United States and China are
similar in size. However, [China's economy will be decimated by a few US
nuclear weapons, as its critical infrastructure is concentrated on the
coastlines and not dispersed like the US infrastructure]{.underline}. [A
war will lead to a loss of China's exports]{.underline} to the United
States worth USD 310 billion. The war will result in a decline in
industrial production, unemployment, and inflation, causing an economic
crash and a people's revolution. As seen from World War II, the United
States will experience reverse economic gains and benefit from the war,
resulting in high employment and industrial growth. It is expensive to
be a superpower. Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War two and a half
millennia ago, "first count the cost."30 China's defense budget cannot
compete with the combined power of United States, India, Japan, and
Australia. The United States alone spends more on national defense than
China, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom,
Japan, South Korea, and Brazil combined.31 Can China afford it? An arms
race will lead to an increase in China's military spending, affecting
its development goals. The Absence of War-fighting Experience The United
States has an analytical learning process in place---China does not.32
Lessons learned have been well documented by the US military in the form
of doctrines, tactics, techniques, and procedures. The US military has
been documenting lessons learned since as early as the Boxer Revolution
during the China campaign.33 The US military has been led by outstanding
military generals like George Marshall, Dwight Eisenhower, George
Patton, and David Petraeus, while China always lacked great generals.
The world sends its military officers to US military institutions and
not China's military colleges. [The PLA strategy is based on Mao's
theory of the weak contender fighting a stronger adversary through
deceit and deception. China's only option is an asymmetric
strategy]{.underline} due to its incapability to fight symmetric wars.
Chinese scholars have authored books like Science of Military Campaigns,
Science of Military Strategy, and Unrestricted Warfare.34 However, China
is unable to convert the strategies and tactics mentioned in these books
into an executable doctrine. The Lack of Power Projection Power
projection capabilities set a superpower apart. From its Charm Offensive
to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has been wielding its
economic power to compel US allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific
region to align with China, which has not been greatly successful.35
China lacks global reach, as it does not have foreign defense treaties
or logistical bases abroad equipped with military stockpiles.36 During a
war with the United States, soliciting Pakistan's military support looks
difficult, as China's all-weather friend has been hesitant to cut its
military ties with the United States. [China is constrained to operate
beyond the unrefueled range of its aircraft, warships, and
submarines]{.underline}. [US nuclear-powered carriers can rule the seas
for four years before being refueled]{.underline}. China's
nonnuclear-powered AC can barely operate beyond its green waters. The
Type 903 replenishment ship can only support two to three ships for
approximately two weeks.37 The USN's 68 nuclear-powered submarines have
been prowling the world's oceans displaying naval power, while the
PLAN's nuclear-powered submarines are unable to do so. Fighter aircraft
operating without a package of air-refueling tankers, Airborne Warning
and Control System aircraft, or a network of expeditionary airfields
cannot travel very far. The PLAAF's capability to target US bases in the
Pacific is hindered by a lack of air-refueling capacity. A flight group
of eight J-11B Flankers will have to be simultaneously refueled twice by
two air-refueling tankers for a seven-hour flight.38 The PLAAF will have
to deploy 20 percent of its tanker fleet to refuel the Flankers. The
PLAAF has 10 tankers for more than a thousand fighter aircraft, while
the USAF has 625 tankers for 1,956 fighter aircraft.39 The tankers will
be the prime targets for the USN potentially putting the Flankers at
risk. [China's only existing bomber, the H-6K, is reverse engineered
from the 1950s Soviet-designed Tu-16 bomber]{.underline}. The bomber is
incapable of attacking Hawaii---even when equipped with CJ-10 cruise
missiles. The H-6K has a range of 3,800 miles, while Hawaii is 5,157
miles from the closest H-6K base. The H-6K cannot attack nearby US
bases, as the bomber will be detected on open seas by the US C4ISR
systems. [PLAAF fighters are unable to escort the bombers, as they
cannot match its range]{.underline}.40 An Archaic Military [Less than 30
percent of China's surface forces, air force, and air defense forces and
55 percent of its submarine fleet were modern in 2011]{.underline}.41.
Subsequently, nothing much has changed, as a substantial percentage of
China's military remains obsolete.42 [China's military faces
institutional shortcomings]{.underline} arising from obsolete command
structures, low quality of personnel, and corruption.43 The military has
weaknesses centering on supporting capabilities such as logistics,
inadequate airlift, and deficient air defense and antisubmarine
warfare.44 The PLA's loyalty to the CCP has hampered its competence.45
China's military training and operational capabilities and competences
do not match US standards.46 PLAAF pilots fall short on the requirement
of executing sophisticated aerial maneuvers during unplanned
operations.47 [China's military structure presents significant cultural
challenges]{.underline},48 [as it emphasizes control above
command]{.underline}.49 [A culture of risk aversion and low levels of
trust in subordinates impacts the PLA effectiveness]{.underline}.50 A
highly centralized structure does not allow the PLAN to operate
autonomously during a war. Therefore, a political commissar is
positioned on PLAN warships and submarines.51 The USN values autonomy
from the individual to the institution, which reflects its emphasis on
commanding at sea.52 Nation states cannot project power globally through
a rigid command-and-control system.53 [PLAN submarines have the worst
safety record in the world]{.underline}.54 The PLAN's rudimentary
nuclear missile submarine fleet carries a limited number of missiles.55
The PLAN cannot threaten the US mainland, as its submarines will have to
sail through chokepoints such as the Kuriles and the Ryukyus islands,
Luzon Strait, Taiwan Strait, and the Philippine archipelago---all of
which are controlled by the USN.56 These chokepoints, forming a
crescent-shaped chain, are also a defensive line for US containment
policy; and the United States is involved in monitoring them. The PLAN
submarine power is outdated, compared to the overwhelming USN undersea
warfare capabilities. The US submarine arm brings strategic deterrence
to the Indo-Pacific through a wide array of capabilities such as
antisubmarine warfare antisurface warfare precision land strike;
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; and special warfare
capabilities. Soviet weapon systems were much sought after by the United
States to learn their strengths and weaknesses. Numerous Soviet-made
fighter aircraft defected during the Cold War. An Iraqi MiG 21 defected
to Israel, while a Soviet MiG 25 landed in Japan. The aircraft were
later handed over to the United States to decipher the technical
details. However, US intelligence is not similarly orchestrating any
defections of PLAAF fighter aircraft, as the United States is not
interested in obsolete Chinese technology. Instead, China is stealing
weapon data or reverse engineering US weapon systems.57 The
CCP-controlled military press described the Shenyang J-15 Flying Shark
fighter aircraft as a "flopping fish" and criticized it for lacking the
stealth capabilities of the F-35 Lightning.58 The US F-117 Nighthawk
stealth fighter entered service in 1983 and saw combat during the First
Gulf War, while the fifth-generation F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning
fighter aircraft have been deployed in conflict zones. However, the
PLAAF has not operationally inducted the J-31 fighter aircraft while the
J-20 fighter aircraft has not yet proven its capabilities in any
bilateral or multilateral military exercise. The much-hyped Chengdu J-20
is a heavy fighter aircraft comparable to the MiG 31, which is
essentially an interceptor and not a multirole or an air superiority
aircraft. China's Vulnerable A2/AD Zones A study of modern wars suggests
that [the United States will **decimate** China's military without
entering the A2/AD zone]{.underline}. This is how the United States
devastated Iraqi defenses in 1990. US strategic depth in Asia will allow
military planners to concentrate the military at different locations.
[The United States has a devastating array of lethal weapon
systems]{.underline}, such as submarines, [for countering China's A2/AD
strategies]{.underline}. During the First Gulf War, the United States
launched 297 Tomahawks, which destroyed the Iraqi military.59 Ohio-class
submarines can operate unhindered in the adversary's A2/AD zone closer
to the shore; thus, striking targets far inland. Collectively, four
Ohio-class submarines installed with 616 BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise
missiles would obliterate China's military. The inexperienced PLAN AC
group will be destroyed by long-range antiship missiles (LRASM),
Tomahawks, and Mark 48-Mod 7 torpedoes launched from USS Key West, USS
Oklahoma City, USS Topeka, and USS Asheville submarines based in Guam.
The USN and USAF have signed a USD 414 million contract for autonomously
guided with onboard sensors, jam-resistant, and difficult to detect
antiship LRASM.60 The stealthy Zumwalt-class warship---equipped with
emerging technologies---can sail undetected in littoral waters and
contested territories to launch LRASM and Tomahawk cruise missiles.
China is constructing military bases on islands in the South China Sea;
however, this military infrastructure is vulnerable to US weapon
systems, as the islands lack natural defenses and camouflage.61 During a
war, the bases will be annihilated by the USN as the PLA cannot hide
behind hills and forests. Once destroyed, these facilities cannot be
supported from the mainland, as the logistical supplies will be
demolished by the USN. China's military modernization may enhance A2/AD
zones, but it does not contribute to a blue-water, sea-control
capability.62 [China's Hyped DF-21 Missile]{.underline} The antiship
DF-21 missile, carried by colossal transporter erector launchers, has a
range of 1,400 miles. The missile regiments are based in the barren Gobi
Desert, which makes it an easy target for the US military. [The DF-21
has been tested on a stationary ship, but it has not yet been
successfully tested against a moving target]{.underline}.63 A system of
systems is required to track the AC,64 acquire the precise location,
keep the missile locked on the target, penetrate the carrier's
multilayered defenses, and provide mid-course updates as within one hour
the ship will have moved 30 miles. China does not know about the DF-21
performance against the US CSG countermeasures.65 The United States and
Russia have not yet developed a missile equivalent to the DF-21.
However, China lacks the C4ISR systems to strike targets at that range.
China does not release the missile testing data, leading to many
questions, including whether it can hit moving targets. Does it have
precision targeting technologies?66 Until proven otherwise, [the
functionality of the missile is based on nothing but circumstantial
inference and speculation]{.underline}.
