# EU-NATO Cooperation CP

### Notes:

Simple "Agent CP." It tests the "US Key" warrants of the affirmative and
is an easy way to solve the affirmative without linking to US action.
The China DA is a clean net-benefit as well as the forthcoming Midterms
DA.

There's also an internal net-benefit, but the perm might solve it and we
only found one card. It just says EU leadership is good and that the CP
might raise their profile and encourage more cooperation beyond the
plan. You could use some of the "European Defence Good" cards from the
NATO Bad/Withdrawal file.

The solvency evidence is pretty good. The EU has resources, expertise,
and organizations to cooperation and there is a lot of ev about the need
for the EU to lay the groundwork for a more integrated European defense
network. Remember, you don't need to solve the entire aff, but could win
with "sufficient" solvency.

Final neg note is that you should consider making the CP texts more
strategic by adding specific planks describing what the EU would do.
Like the Diplomacy CP, the EU can't do everything the DOD can, BUT it
can take a number of actions to address the same harms (coordination,
capacity building, data sharing, and development).

The aff has some perm options, not only because you can "do both" but
also because NATO includes US as a member already, so "Perm - Do the CP"
is an argument. The aff should rely on their US key cards from case and
point out that a lot of the neg evidence says that the EU should
cooperate more, but that they haven't and aren't really prepared to on
that scale (the ev is prescriptive, not descriptive).

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS In a world marked by COVID-19, deeper social
divisions, more vulnerable supply chains, and increased competition in
the international arena, the roles of [NATO and the EU]{.underline} and
their ability to tackle global challenges are constantly being
questioned. Moreover, with the proliferation of ad hoc coalitions to
tackle specific challenges, the two organizations [are constantly
fighting for relevance and space to operate]{.underline}. In this
context, as this paper has shown, both **[NATO and the EU have more to
gain through joining forces rather than competing with one
another.]{.underline}** In light of the arguments developed so far, some
broad [policy recommendations]{.underline} appear relevant: 1. [NATO and
EU member states should leverage their policy fora to discuss joint
initiatives and better employ their assets --- NATO's military
capabilities and logistical systems and the EU's capacity building and
financial assistance.]{.underline} This would enable a more coordinated
approach to crises based on a division of labor agreed to on a
case-by-case basis. Learning from past experiences, the two
organizations should work to avoid another "Afghanistan scenario" in
areas like the Sahel region. 2. [NATO and the EU should increase
information sharing]{.underline} [and establish protocols
in]{.underline} crucial sectors from anti-terrorism [cooperation to
**cybersecurity**]{.underline}. The periodic joint exercises performed
so far are important steps toward building confidence and fostering
regular updates and the sharing of best practices. Yet insufficient
information sharing and the lack of protocols in case of a crisis hinder
the utility of the exercises conducted. While this recommendation
ultimately depends on political will, some smaller channels could be
created to streamline limited but vital information, especially in the
event of a cyberattack. 3. [Regarding **disinformation**, NATO should
take advantage of the EU's apparatus and support it with its own solid
structure for intelligence gathering]{.underline} --- instead of having
NATO's Public Diplomacy Division duplicate the work of the EU StratCom
task force. Alternatively, because countering disinformation is not the
main job of the division, NATO could create a separate disinformation
unit to work closely with the EU's task force. [Coordinating efforts to
tackle different outlets of disinformation could help reduce the overall
burden.]{.underline} In both scenarios, the two organizations should not
just seek to counter disinformation but also prevent it as much as
possible. 4. [NATO and the EU should increase their dialogue on
regulations and impediments to military mobility and
**interoperability**]{.underline}. NATO's deeper expertise on strategic
airlifting and military operations could help the EU improve regulations
to facilitate military mobility. More broadly[, NATO should leverage EU
regulatory power in conjunction with its objectives when it comes to
**capacity building** as well as in countering **China's** multifaceted
influence]{.underline}. 5. [To reinforce NATO's posture in Europe and
elsewhere, the EU should boost its military capability]{.underline} (as
member states' militaries contribute to NATO's single set of forces).
[Enhanced military capabilities would also enable the EU to intervene
**independently from the United States** in theaters that are no longer
security priorities for Washington.]{.underline} [European countries
will need to assess their defense spending for **greater efficiency**
and assess the advantages of a more integrated procurement
system]{.underline}. [While doing so, Europeans should consider
mechanisms to enable the U.S. defense industry to participate; this
could **minimize the economic losses**, foster **technological
development** and **cooperation** on a trans-Atlantic level, and reduce
dependence on geopolitically risky supplies]{.underline}. 6. [NATO and
the EU should foster cooperation in procurement and capability
development to increase interoperability, including through the
establishment of similar standards]{.underline}. This would enhance
military mobility and interoperability across Europe and other theaters
like the Indo-Pacific, where the engagement of the U.S. and Europe is
growing.

\~ Evolving to a joint model [The priority for the EU and NATO is to now
find agreement on how to mitigate cyber- security threats which are
becoming more frequent and more sophisticated]{.underline}. EU-NATO :
[**cooperation is essential** to allow European and transatlantic
governments to become better at preventing, detecting, and deterring
cyberattacks, as well as to hold those that engage in malicious cyber
activities accountable.]{.underline} As such, both organisations must
continue to seek new ways of cooperation that deepen and broaden their
engagement. The following recommendations are achievable, some
immediately and others in the long term. But [given the scale of the
threat, it is necessary to think ambitiously]{.underline}. [Create an
EU-NATO cyber threat information hub]{.underline} Joint structures that
combine EU and NATO resources or expertise are nothing new. The European
Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki is a good
example of how, with the necessary good will, the EU and NATO can work
together un- der the same roof. The creation of an EU-NATO Cyber Threat
Information Hub could be another step in this vein. The mission of such
a hub would simply be to improve information sharing by building
relations and networks between the EU, NATO, mem- ber states and
partners. It could do so first of all by advising technical and
operation- al level Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for information
exchange between the EU and NATO entities, and identifying how to enable
secure lines of communication to share confidential cyber intelligence.
In addition, it could assist the EU and NATO in defining what type of
information needs to be shared, who needs to receive it, when the
information needs to be shared, and making sure the information is
released in a timely and appropriate manner. In this regard, the hub
could make active recommendations concerning the growing role of
automated information sharing in identifying rele- vant information more
quickly, but also in automating threat mitigation in real time.
Automated sharing of security and threat information could also help the
EU and NATO to [standardise their threat intelligence]{.underline}. The
hub could identify adequate informa- tion-sharing platforms or
information-storage clouds that can withstand increasingly complex
attacks, based on open industry specifications. Such platforms bring
several benefits. They enable rapid communication and peer-based
sharing, they reduce cost, and increase the speed of cyber defences by
substituting manual responses for auto- mated processes. In this regard,
the hub could make active proposals on how to use the EU's Permanent
Structured Cooperation (PESCO) or the European Defence Fund (EDF) to
develop this type of technological capacity. The recent proposal of
eight EU member states to develop a 'Cyber Threats and Incident Response
Information Sharing Platform' under PESCO encourages more thinking in
this direction. The success of EU- NATO cooperation in preventing,
detecting and deterring cyberattacks will ultimately be defined by the
ability of the two organisations to share information more effectively.
Cautious steps in this direction have already been taken; for instance
the EU was grant- ed access to the NATO Malware Information Sharing
Platform. But both organisations will need to continue to explore bold
initiatives if they are to address today's informa- tion-sharing gap.
**[Establish an EU-NATO Taskforce for cyber crisis response
coordination]{.underline}** To efficiently synchronise their cyber
crisis response mechanisms the EU and NATO : will need to create
additional capacity. The [existing structures that allow the EU and -
NATO to come together are still limited,]{.underline} ranging from
formal and informal meetings \~ between the North Atlantic Council (NAC)
and the EU Political and Security Committee (PSC), exchanges at
ministerial meetings, cross briefings to respective Committees and i -
Councils, and informal staff-to-staff interaction, for instance between
the European External Action Service and NATO's International Staff.
These interactions are valu- : able, but they do not represent a solid
basis for guaranteeing an efficient and smooth \| \~ collective response
in the event of a real cyber crisis. A roadmap for collective response
is therefore needed. An immediate way to achieve this would be to create
a structure --- like a joint taskforce --- that brings together the EU
Cyber Crisis Response Framework \~ and NATO's Crisis Response System.
This taskforce would be convened when a ma- jor cyber incident strikes
multiple EU member states and NATO Allies or EU/NATO institutions. To
prepare this taskforce for operational duties, in a first stage, its
task would be \| to map the full spectrum of EU and NATO competencies
for cyber defence, to clari- fy responsibilities at national and
supranational levels for issues like attribution and countermeasures,
and based on this information to create a common template of cyber
crisis management phases. Once such a common template is created, in a
second stage,% \~ the taskforce could then be convened to respond to
cyber incidents. This taskforce! could also be useful in many other
ways. For instance, it could make recommenda \~ tions on how to
synchronise joint strategic communication among EU and NATO in-
stitutions, or make proposals on how to use EU PESCO and NATO structures
to supporti countries before, during and after crises. It could also
look at creating linkages betweeni the EU 'Cyber Rapid Response Teams'
currently being developed under PESCO and the! existing NATO Rapid
Reaction Team to Fight Cyber Attacks. Finally the taskforce couldi also
make suggestions on how to include NATO into the EU Commission
'Blueprint toi respond to large-scale cybersecurity incidents and
crises'. The EU and NATO have a§ wide array of crisis management tools
at their disposal, but they are disconnected. [An% ambitious, but much
needed step, would now be to align those different instruments and to
create an EU-NATO 'playbook' on how to react to cyber incidents and
crises. **Develop EU-NATO triggers for a collective response to
cyberattacks**]{.underline} Talking openly about active and reactive
responses in cyberspace is no longer taboo fori EU or NATO member
states. And the policy instruments to conduct an offensive strategy or
to sanction adversaries are steadily increasing. NATO for instance has
already \~ recognised that a serious cyberattack on a member state could
be a potential triggeri for Article 5. At its November 2017 defence
ministerial the Alliance also agreed to cre ate a Cyber Operations
Centre that will facilitate the integration of cyber capabilities with
conventional military capabilities. The EU for its part created in 2017
its Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, a framework for a joint EU diplomatic
response to malicious cyber activities. In May 2019, EU countries also
agreed that individuals and groups conducting cyberattacks from outside
the bloc may be hit with potential sanctions, including travel bans and
asset freezes. These measures have boosted the EU's and NATO's
individual capacity to hit back at cyber adversaries. But there is today
no template on how to synchronise these different EU and NATO tools, nor
is there agreement on the conditions that would trig- ger the collective
use of these tools. In other words, the circumstances in which the EU
and NATO would work together to adopt a responsive or offensive posture
are still éambiguous. While NATO and the EU have to an extent
consciously embraced ambigu- éity for its strategic value, the absence
of a clearer definition of an offensive posture, : and of the
circumstances, degree, and manner in which counter-measures can or
should be taken if member states perceive a cyber threat or suffer a
cyberattack, make 1t more difficult for the EU and NATO to respond
collectively. The conditions to use Ethe EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox or
the trigger for NATO to launch an offensive cyber : campaign may be
clear if a member state faces a large-scale, devastating cyber cri-
ésis. However, most cyberattacks fall below the threshold of being
perceived as a clear act of aggression. Formulating a proportionate
response in this grey zone constitutes the biggest problem. Russian
'active measures' in Europe are for instance clearly de- ésigned to
exploit these grey zones, and the Kremlin has acquired some
sophistication i in avoiding red lines that would trigger a common
response from EU or NATO member Estates. Russia is also not the only
potential adversary capable of similar tactics. There is thus an acute
need to define when and how the EU and NATO must respond against i
day-to-day cyber intrusions. The development of a set of EU-NATO basic
principles, or (non-binding) guidelines that would trigger a joint
response would be a good first step. The Tallinn Manual® published by
the NATO Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence could offer inspiration on
how the EU and NATO can define these principles while respecting the
application of international law. Currently the EU and NATO need to
assess each individual cyber threat or cyberattack on a case-by-case
basis without the support of standard measurement tools and indicators
that can help them formulate a swift and proportionate response. This
considerably slows down the decision-making process. However, if the EU
and NATO were to dispose of a set of pre-agreed principles, it would
significantly improve their joint reactiveness and resilience.
**[Intensify joint cyber exercises]{.underline}**, foster a culture of
mutual trust Exercising, training and learning together is key to better
understand each other's institutional processes, to develop common
responses, and to cultivate a culture of trust. In their history, the EU
and NATO have found it difficult to adopt such a mind- \~ set. They held
only one joint crisis management exercise in 2003, which prioritised
politico-military priorities and did not include cyber assets. The EU
and NATO also planned, but failed, to implement more exercises in 2007,
2010, and 2014. The Joint \~ Declarations of 2016 and 2018 have
nevertheless turned the tide and today both organi- sations exercise,
train and learn together more than ever before. But the rapprochement is
in many cases still cautious. A key example are the EU and NATO
'coordinated and parallel' crisis management exercises --- EU PACE and
NATO CMX. Synchronising EU and NATO flagship exercises is a commendable
step to develop more interaction but : working in parallel is still a
very different concept than a 'joint exercise'. De facto, EU \| PACE and
NATO CMX remain independent initiatives, they constitute only one
signif- icant occasion per year where the EU and NATO exercise together,
and they are not conducted at the same moment in time which represents
an important disconnect with a joint crisis response in reality. A more
realistic approach to creating a fully-fledged - EU-NATO joint exercise
is perhaps to think small-scale. A useful angle in this respect would be
to have EU-NATO staffs exercise how to align specific technical cyber
inci- i dent information (from computer security incident response teams
--- CSIRTs) with \~ military intelligence threat assessments. Moreover,
exercises must also go hand-in- \~ hand with joint training and
education opportunities. The EU and NATO have already opened up their
cyber courses to each other's staffs. As a next step, [they could
further explore how to integrate NATO cyber defence courses with the
recently launched EU - Cyber Education, Training and Exercise
platform]{.underline} - an initiative from the European Security and
Defence College to harmonise and standardise cyber defence education
for - EU member states. Coherent training and joint exercises will be
key to create a mutual \~ culture of trust and understanding. **[Create
a common Cyber Trust Fund]{.underline}** for partner countries Today the
EU and NATO work individually with their partner nations on cybersecuri-
ty and defence programmes. But [EU and NATO programmes could become more
effi- cient if both institutions coordinate their assistance in order to
create more synergy and avoid duplication.]{.underline} The EU and NATO
could coordinate their assistance for partners around issues like
technical cyber capabilities, information networks, and standards. A
coordinated approach would also enable partners to more efficiently
share with the EU and NATO their firsthand information, expertise, and
experience. To complement or bundle the efforts of various EU or NATO
assistance providers, an independent Cyber Trust Fund, supported by the
EU and NATO, could be created. Access to the Trust Fund could be granted
to EU Associated Countries or partner countries of the NATO Euro-
Atlantic Partnership, Mediterranean Dialogue, Istanbul Cooperation
Initiative and Global Partnerships. The management of EU-NATO donations
and screening of project proposals could be managed by an independent
private law foundation --- for instance based on the model of the
European Endowment for Democracy. The Trust Fund could address an
important gap by focusing on the buildup of local and grassroot cyber
skills and enable various stakeholders in partner nations to attend EU
or NATO cyber courses, seminars, training sessions and conferences, or
to organise similar types of activities in their homeland. The Trust
Fund could adopt new approaches towards the develop- ment of local
skills (government, corporate or civil society), for instance by
requiring local partners to be involved in the project, and avoid
situations where European or American contractors simply export their
technology or knowhow to the partner na- tions. In this light, the Trust
Fund could only support projects proposed by the partner nations, rather
than copying the EU and NATO approach of pre-defining specifics for
trust fund projects. [The EU and NATO have worked together on financial
assistance programmes in the past,]{.underline} such as the regular EU
contributions to NATO trust funds for the disposal of unexploded
ordnances, and anticorruption initiatives. In this light, the
development of an independent EU-NATO Cyber Trust fund may not be such a
far- fetched idea after all. [**Shape global norms around state
behaviour in cyberspace** To sustain global peace and security, much
capacity to prevent irresponsible state be- haviour already exists in
traditional domains such as nuclear, chemical or biological
warfare.]{.underline} But the legal tools to stop governments across the
world from engaging in malicious cyber activities are still limited. The
lack of international agreement on rules regulating state behaviour in
cyberspace or triggers for 'digital self-defence' com- plicates efforts
to manage cross-border cyberthreats. As such, [the EU and NATO, as two
**rather like-minded bodies with overlapping memberships**, have the
opportunity to shape their own common vision for responsible nation
state behaviour in cyber- space and project it to the world
stage.]{.underline} Today, the most significant platform to clarify the
application of legal frameworks in cyberspace probably remains [the UN
General Assembly's First Committee, which deals with disarmament and
international security]{.underline}. In this context the EU and NATO
should have a common dialogue on how they can assist the work done by
the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security
(UNGGE) --- a UN platform designed to debate the applicability of
internation- al law in cyberspace[. EU-NATO cooperation could also be
used to advance ideas about transparency and accountability in
cyberspace in other international platforms]{.underline}, from the G20
to the OECD or OSCE." The current volatile geopolitical relations on
cyber- \~ security between major powers such as Russia, China, the US or
the EU, means that \| finding global compromise around the rules of
state behaviour in cyberspace remains : very much an open question.
**[The EU and NATO have an opportunity here to lead the way and use
their combined political weight to promote their ideas on this issue on
the global stage.]{.underline}** Adapting together The accelerating
change of the digital age, and the challenges it brings, is placing new
pressures on the traditional structures of intergovernmental
organisations like the EU or NATO. It also highlights how these
traditional structures can find it difficult to co- : ordinate with each
other, even if the political will to do so is there. However, both the
EU and NATO will continue to face threats emerging from cyberspace. For
a long time, : \~ both found themselves ill-adapted to deal with this
new reality, but change is on the horizon. And common responses are
slowly but surely being developed to assert EU and NATO credibility in
cyberspace in the eyes of their members, partners --- and, in- deed,
adversaries. Clearly, bold initiatives are needed. [The EU and NATO must
transit : from an agenda that strengthens their coordination, exchange
and consultation mech- anisms, to initiatives that improve their joint
force-multiplying functions, their cyber \| \~ capabilities, their
communication and decision-making structures in cyber exercises, crises
and conflicts, and their interoperability with partners in
cyberspace.]{.underline} EU-NATO : [cooperation in cyberspace has taken
its first small steps, but it will take a bigger leap]{.underline} \~
forward to adapt to a digital age that is constantly, and rapidly,
evolving.

This, at a time when [the European continent is confronting multiple
crises]{.underline} whose solutions will require ingenuity, innovative

closer collaboration between the EU and NATO makes]{.underline} sense
for several reasons. [There is now greater overlap in membership than
ever before---22 out of 28 NATO countries]{.underline} also [belong to
the EU]{.underline}. [European allies are worried about **an American
retreat**]{.underline} and want to see a reinvigorated U.S. commitment
to their security. In fortifying ties between the two organizations,
Europe could be reassured by an abiding American involvement on their
continent. [And deeper bonds between NATO and the EU could have tangible
political benefits,]{.underline} perhaps even to help persuade Britain
to stay in the EU. [For the United States, this kind of initiative
**could revitalize the transatlantic alliance as the foundation of our
political, security, and economic relations with the rest of the
world**]{.underline}. It could also demonstrate that the community of
Western democracies still remains our front line in defending common
values and interests in the 21st century. [A new approach to Western
security cooperation---starting by creating **a joint policy planning
council linking the EU and NATO**---should extend beyond military
thinking and pursue more imaginative responses to current
threats]{.underline}. Those include [**hybrid warfare by Russia**,
surging waves of refugees from North Africa and the Middle East,
pandemic disease, climate change, and economic instability on Europe's
periphery.]{.underline} Future security challenges will demand more
pluralistic policy responses that could be best accomplished by
combining NATO and EU assets and capabilities. In the fight against
terrorism, NATO could work directly with the EU to connect national
criminal databases and use the EU's special powers to seize financial
assets of suspected criminals. The [EU and NATO should also collaborate
to **avoid conflict with Russia** over the control of energy resources
and shipping lanes through the Arctic region]{.underline}. The melting
polar icecap will transform global shipping routes by shaving thousands
of nautical miles and up to seven days of travel time off current
itineraries through the Suez and Panama canals. For those reasons alone,
[it is imperative for the West to prevent **Russian domination in the
Arctic**.]{.underline} Other [regional challenges]{.underline} will
require closer NATO and EU cooperation. The United Nations predicts [the
world will need 70 percent more food to feed a global population of 9.6
billion by 2050;]{.underline} some experts say at least three dozen
countries could be desperately short of crops or fresh water within the

Over the past two decades, discussions on EU-NATO relations have been
closely associated with crisis-management operations and transnational
threats. But that is yesterday's world. [The return of great-power
competition is eliciting a shift in European security and transatlantic
relations toward deterrence and defense.]{.underline} As such the
conceptual framework that has so far underpinned debates on EU-NATO
relations has been, by and large, rendered obsolete. The return of
great-power competition and growing uncertainty about the United
States\' commitment to Europe have led to renewed calls to turn the EU
into an autonomous pole in global politics. Some even toy with the
notion of European equidistance in a global context that is increasingly
defined by Sino-American competition. [At the same time, the EU's need
to give its global role security and a transatlantic anchor underlines
the **potential of a more structured EU-NATO dialogue.** Great-power
competition also has important implications for capability
development]{.underline}. [A key challenge is to ensure that the **EU's
new defense initiatives help reinforce NATO's ongoing efforts in
deterrence and defense.**]{.underline} One way to do that would be to
give the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security
Policy the authority to bring together the industrial and
politico-strategic aspects of the union's defense policy and thus act as
an effective bridge between the EU and NATO. The last three years have
witnessed a steady flow of self-congratulatory remarks about
unprecedented progress in the relationship between the European Union
and NATO. Their joint statements in 2016 and 2018 provided a compass for
greater cooperation between them. But it is important to put this in
perspective and ensure that the relationship keeps apace with a rapidly
changing--- and worsening---geostrategic environment. [Discussions on
EU-NATO cooperation remain stuck on a 1990s wavelength, taking crisis
management and transnational challenges as their key
referents]{.underline}. [As NATO leaders meet in London and the EU
undergoes a leadership transition, they should **revamp their dialogue**
around the increasingly important theme of **great-power
competition**.]{.underline} Crisis-Management Cooperation Ever since the
EU stepped into the realm of security and defense in 1999, discussions
on EU-NATO relations have been intimately linked with the notion of
European strategic autonomy. See, for example, Jolyon Howorth, European
integration and defense: the ultimate challenge? European Union
Institute for Security Studies, 2000. Whereas European countries tend to
see the EU's Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) as a useful means
to curb over-reliance on the United States in security matters, the
latter has traditionally perceived the EU's ventures in this domain as
both an opportunity and a challenge. This equivocal attitude on the part
of NATO's leading member has also reflected on the EU-NATO relationship,
which has always displayed a mix of competition and cooperation. From
the outset, the United States warned that any attempt by Europeans to
pursue security cooperation in the EU framework should avoid duplicating
existing NATO structures, discriminating against non-EU NATO members, or
decoupling the EU from the transatlantic security architecture. Yet, it
also recognized that there was a growing political demand for European
strategic autonomy. More importantly, perhaps, this demand came at a
time when the United States was adopting a less direct and engaged
approach to European security affairs, as it sought to shift its
attention to other regions. For this shift to be successful, [Europeans
would have to do more in the security sphere]{.underline}. European
integration and defense. From a U.S. viewpoint, there was a way to
square the European security circle: CSDP would be welcome as long as it
helped overcome Europe's strategic introspection and generate the
capabilities needed for expeditionary operations while being firmly
embedded in the NATO framework. Key EU member states like the United
Kingdom and Germany were sympathetic to this vision. Thus, a sort of
balance emerged, with the EU explicitly acknowledging NATO's monopoly in
collective defense and confining its venture into security policy to the
realm of external crisis management, and more particularly to those
contingencies where NATO as a whole was not engaged. This arrangement
would still work for those countries, like France, eager to underscore
the EU's autonomy vis-à-vis NATO and the United States. The absence of
great-power competitors and the salience of transnational challenges
meant that collective defense and deterrence were not really on Europe's
politico-strategic radar. In this vein, the 2003 European Security
Strategy noted that " large-scale aggression against any Member States"
had become "improbable" and that Europe was facing "new threats" such as
terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional
conflicts in the European periphery, "failed states," or organized
crime. The focus was not so much on high-end warfare against
peer-adversaries, but rather on external crisis management in militarily
semi-permissive environments. [When it comes to external crisis
management, the EU and NATO have been cooperating and competing at the
same time]{.underline}. On the one hand, the 2002 Berlin Plus agreements
granted the EU access to NATO assets for the planning and conduct of
such operations, while efforts to coordinate capability-development
processes in the EU and NATO outlined the complementarity between them.
On the other hand, the EU's efforts to set up its own command
arrangements as well as to launch operations in Africa---often at
France's behest---underlined the principle of political and operational
autonomy from NATO and the United States. Enter Great-Power Competition
For almost two decades, the concept of European strategic autonomy and
discussions on the EU-NATO relationship were closely associated with
external crisis-management operations---but that is yesterday's world.
Neither the EU nor NATO have given up on this field, which remains
particularly relevant in Europe's extended southern neighborhood.
However, [the return of great-power competition is eliciting a
conceptual shift in U.S. and European thinking, away from crisis
management and transnational threats and toward **deterrence and
defense.**]{.underline} The return of great-power competition is
increasingly recognized in NATO and EU circles. [For the alliance,
Russia's annexation of Crimea marked a turning point.]{.underline} The
2014 and 2016 NATO summits in Wales and Warsaw ushered in rebalancing to
the core business of **[deterrence and defense in a context of Russian
revisionism]{.underline}**, even as crisis management would still remain
part of NATO's remit. More recently, [the question of how to deal with
China has also found its way into NATO debates,]{.underline} partly as a
result of repeated U.S. references to the country as a "long-term
strategic competitor" and "the greatest threat to the West," but also
partly spurred by European worries about Beijing's recent military
exercises in the Mediterranean and Baltic seas, and its military
modernization. Against this backdrop, NATO launched an internal
strategic reflection on China earlier this year. For its part, the EU
already referred to Russia as a strategic challenge in its 2016 global
strategy, and it has more recently defined China as a systemic rival. In
his confirmation hearing, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and
Security Policy Josep Borrell alluded to the existence of an
increasingly competitive world and argued that the EU should learn to
"use the language of power." This theme resonates with European
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's call for a more
"geopolitical Commission."'A commission to stand up for Europe's
interests', [A New Framework for EU-NATO Relations]{.underline}? [The
shift from a world dominated by transnational security challenges to one
increasingly defined by great-power competition will have a pervasive
impact on discussions on EU-NATO relations.]{.underline} Over the last
three years, **[the Trump administration has expressed disdain for the
multilateral, rules-based order Europeans hold so dear]{.underline}**,
and instead emphasized great-power competition with China and, to a
lesser extent, Russia. While [the EU is also concerned about Russian
revisionism and China's rise, Trump's repeated swipes at it have also
provided much political impetus in support **of greater European
political and strategic autonomy**]{.underline}. [There seems to be
growing political support in EU circles around the need to reject a
binary choice between the United States and China, and]{.underline}
instead[, invest in the development of the union as an autonomous pole
in great-power politics]{.underline}. Yet, the existence of deeply
rooted shared values within the West, the United States' ongoing role in
European security, and the fact that many European countries (especially
in Central and Eastern Europe) have a closer political allegiance to
Washington than Brussels underscores the limits to the notion of EU
strategic autonomy and geopolitical equidistance between the United
States and China. [Great-power competition bears important implications
for capability development.]{.underline} It is one thing for European
countries to be operationally autonomous in the context of relatively
modest out-of-area operations conducted against non-peer adversaries and
another for them to deter or defend themselves against a great power
such as Russia[. The EU]{.underline}---and more particularly the
European Defence Agency---[has in recent years insisted that
its]{.underline} work on capability cannot be restricted to crisis
management and [must incorporate capabilities required for defense and
deterrence, regardless of whether they will be used directly by the EU
itself or simply to boost the capabilities of its member
states.]{.underline} This principle is meant to inform three key EU
initiatives: the Capability Development Plan (CDP), the Coordinated
Annual Review on Defence (CARD), and Permanent Structured Cooperation
(PESCO). The CDP identifies those capabilities that the EU should
collectively prioritize on the basis of evolving strategic and
technological trends, thus providing a reference for CARD, which surveys
existing defense capabilities and identifies opportunities for
cooperation, and PESCO, which provides a framework to develop key 4
capabilities collaboratively. Yet, while the EU has the potential to
develop the capabilities needed for defense and deterrence (nuclear
weapons excepted), its current efforts (including through PESCO) are
still primarily focused on the lower end of the military spectrum. [The
conceptual leap from crisis management to full-spectrum defense
capabilities in EU circles opens up opportunities for cooperation with
NATO in this field]{.underline}, not least [given the renewed importance
that European armed forces attach to deterrence,]{.underline} [which
NATO excels at and has much more experience in]{.underline} than the EU.
This underscores the relevance of the NATO Defense Planning Process
(NDPP), "a framework to harmonize national and NATO defense planning
activities to enable Allies to provide the necessary forces and
capabilities in the most effective way." Notably, the CDP is meant to
take into consideration NDPP requirements. Likewise, CARD aspires to
develop in coherence with the NDPP wherever requirements overlap while
acknowledging the different nature of the two organizations. In that
same vein, the 25 EU member states that signed on to PESCO declared that
it is complementary with NATO and insisted that the alliance "will
continue to be the cornerstone of collective defense for its
members."Yet it remains unclear to what extent the CDP, PESCO, and CARD
will actually feed into the NDPP process or provide an alternative
framework. The key political challenge for the three EU initiatives is
to make themselves relevant in the context of the newly launched
European Defense Fund (EDF), which puts their relationship with NATO and
the NDPP on the back burner. This leads to a critical sticking point in
the EU-NATO relationship. In 2017, the European Commission launched the
EDF as a vehicle to provide financial incentives to member states to
advance toward a more efficient and competitive European
defense-industrial base. In 2020, the European Defense Industrial
Development Program will devote around €500 million to collaborative
defense capability endeavors and some €90 million are already being
invested in defense research projects. In 2021-2027, the EDF will invest
€13 billion (about €1.8 billion per year). The United States has raised
concerns about the difficulties for third-party participation in the EDF
(as in PESCO), arguing that such barriers could undermine the integrity
of the transatlantic defense market. The broader question, however, is
to what extent the European Commission's efforts on the
defense-industrial front are grounded in a common political-strategic
vision about the future of European defense. This is problematic within
the EU framework, not least as the failure to give the high
representative for foreign affairs and security policy a pivotal role in
the EDF decision-making progress will only serve to aggravate the
decoupling between the industrial aspects of European defense and the
politico-strategic ones. Some measures have been adopted to ensure some
interface between the two, such as placing the European Defense Agency
at the center of the CDP, CARD, and PESCO processes, allowing it to act
as a transmission belt to ensure that the EU's industrial and
technological priorities are capability-based, and thus strategy-based.
Yet, as long as the European Commission remains in control of allocating
the EDF's money, there is no guarantee that funding decisions will be
made on the basis of strategic considerations. [The problem of an
industrial-strategic gap in European defense transcends intra-EU
bureaucratic rivalries, and even the EU itself.]{.underline} To the
extent that [the **key challenge is great-power competition and
deterrence,** the **real decoupling** between the industrial and
strategic aspects of European defense **is the one between the EU and
NATO.**]{.underline} Since [the growing importance of deterrence and
defense underline NATO's centrality to European security]{.underline},
[strengthening the connection]{.underline} between the EDF, the CDP, and
the NDP [is **critical** to redressing the existing gap between the
technological-industrial and strategic aspects of European
defense.]{.underline}

In this regard, the [EU appears to have a]{.underline} **[comparative
advantage]{.underline}** [given the role of the European Defense Agency
to go beyond specific operational requirements and its ability to
consider long-term trends and ways member states can cooperate on the
development of new capabilities]{.underline}. In particular, the [EU
defense procurement benefits from **strong support from EU-led research
and development programs**]{.underline}, [as well as]{.underline} from
**[considerable financial resources]{.underline}** [from the European
Defense Fund]{.underline}. As European defense capabilities advance,
there will be **[overlap]{.underline}** [between the EU Capability
Development Priorities and the NATO Defense Planning
Process]{.underline}; this [gives the EU and NATO an
**opportunity**]{.underline} [to foster]{.underline} **[greater
cooperation]{.underline}** [and build up a more efficient and
competitive trans-atlantic defense]{.underline}.73 A recent study from
the French Institute of International Relations identifies areas where
defense requirements could be harmonized and where the [EU and NATO
could work on joint research projects: from **cyberdefense**, air
superiority, **logistics**, and **medical** support capabilities to
**science** and **technology**, **arms control**, and
**intelligence**]{.underline}.74 A [more synchronized
approach]{.underline} in these areas --- that would also entail a joint
assessment of member state performances --- [will **undoubtedly**
reinforce both NATO- and EU-led operations as well as
deterrence]{.underline}.

However, [the]{.underline} next [four years of the Biden
presidency]{.underline} should not be wasted on meta-debates. They
[present a window of opportunity for both sides of the Atlantic. It is
up to the Europeans to prove that the European quest for greater
strategic sovereignty can at the same time be positive for the
transatlantic partnership and that a strong and self-reliant Europe is
**in America's interest**]{.underline}. And it is up to the Americans to
show that they are interested in real partnership on greater eye-level,
instead of curating vassals. [The starting conditions are good:
President Biden wants to repair the shattered relationship with the
Europeans and make the transatlantic partnership the cornerstone of a
unified Western approach toward great power competition]{.underline}.
The [recent US request to join a PESCO project on military mobility as a
third country represents an **initial test case** -- and a big
opportunity - for a **constructive future EU-US
cooperation**]{.underline}. [For]{.underline} the
[Europe]{.underline}ans, [this]{.underline} also [means that they must
contribute greater added value to the transatlantic partnership through
measures that **simultaneously** strengthen their own strategic
sovereignty]{.underline}. First of all, [this would be the development
and procurement of **more effective European capabilities**, including
high-end spectrum capabilities and strategic enablers]{.underline}. Very
few PESCO initiatives currently address these capability gaps. [Even if
the issue of transatlantic industrial cooperation will remain difficult
--]{.underline} Biden will be tough when it comes to buying and selling
American -- [a **basic willingness** to support credible efforts to
strengthen European defence capabilities is there]{.underline}. But the
[EU will need to demonstrate that its efforts go beyond subsidizing
European defence industries and lead to a tangible boost in Europe's
operational equipment that would be available also **within a NATO
framework**]{.underline}. Second, the [EU]{.underline} needs to take
some military load off the United States. They [should assume greater
regional responsibility in its Southern and Eastern neighbourhood and
also increase their operational readiness for operations
abroad]{.underline}. Third, [Europeans should spell out what the
**European pillar of NATO** is supposed to be]{.underline} and how it
relates to CSDP. **[Cooperation]{.underline}** [between the EU and NATO
has made much progress in recent years, but there is clearly still
**unused potential**]{.underline}. [Capability development and defence
planning could be even better coordinated and further
aligned]{.underline}. The ongoing Strategic Compass process should be
closely linked to the NATO review process, [especially in the areas of
countering **cyber** and **hybrid threats** as well as fighting
terrorism and **disinformation** campaigns, cooperation between the two
institutions should be strengthened]{.underline}. The EU needs to
reemphasise its effort to strengthen European military mobility and
provide adequate funding.

As the allies meet with the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs

organizations need a more ambition agenda for cooperation]{.underline}.
In particular, the [EU and NATO need to consider a joint task force on
fostering defense innovation and EDTs]{.underline}, with renewable
two-year mandates. [This instrument would provide political impetus for
**closer cooperation on EDTs**, it would give coherence, regularity, and
structure to the efforts of the two sides, and ensure commonality of
purpose and synergy of output]{.underline}. In addition, [allies could
consider meeting regularly in **EU-NATO** digital **summit

[Cybersecurity and defense have long been part of EU and NATO

Crimea and semiclandestine military actions [returned new urgency to
European]{.underline} defense and deterrence, but also to [cyberdefense
and readiness]{.underline} as Russia's hybrid aggressions against
Ukraine included cyber-attacks[.3 Since then, NATO and the EU have
intensified their initiatives in the cyber sphere.]{.underline} [NATO
endorsed an]{.underline} enhanced [cyber defense policy]{.underline} and

[The EU and NATO are targeted by the same cyber threat vectors that
undermine all levels of society in member states, threatening civil,
political, econom- ic and military security]{.underline}. The [vast
increase in the number of cyberattacks and the emergence of
cyberspace]{.underline} as a new battlefield [has motivated the EU and
NATO]{.underline} to launch initiatives to strengthen their cyber
resilience, and [to increase]{.underline} their [mutual consultations
and coordination in the cyber domain]{.underline}. While the recent
progress in EU- NATO cyber relations is commendable, this chapter
nevertheless argues that t[he EU and NATO will eventually need to
**evolve from today's coordinated approach** to a more ambitious and
integrated joint model of cooperation if they are to respond adequately
to the security threats that shape today's digital age.]{.underline} The
first part of this chapter out- lines the history of EU-NATO cooperation
in cyberspace. The second part highlights the present-day challenges
that prevent a more ambitious EU-NATO cooperation agenda. The third part
formulates concrete recommendations on how to move from a coordi- nated
approach to a joint model for EU-NATO cooperation in cyberspace. EU and
NATO responses to cyber insecurity Cybersecurity and defence have long
been part of the EU and NATO calculus but it is only gradually that the
issue moved to the top of their policy agendas.! The first game-changer
for Europe came in 2007, when a series of coordinated cyberattacks on
Estonia forced both institutions to think more seriously about this type
of threat. With the aftermath of Estonia in mind, in 2008 NATO developed
its very first Cyber Defence Policy. Five years later, in 2013, the EU
followed suit by adopting its first \~ Cybersecurity Strategy. Another
wake-up call for Europe came with the 2014 crisis in Ukraine. Russia's
an- \| nexation of Crimea and semi-clandestine military actions in
Donbass lent new urgency \~ to cyber defence and readiness because
Russia's hybrid aggression against Ukraine also - included sophisticated
cyberattacks.? Since then, cybersecurity has loomed increasing- ly large
in NATO and EU priorities and both institutions' initiatives in the
cyber domain \~ have increased exponentially. NATO endorsed an enhanced
cyber defence policy and action plan in 2011, and it decided to
operationalise cyberspace as a domain of defence policy and planning in
2016. That same year all Allies also made a Cyber Defence Pledge to
enhance their cyber resilience as a matter of priority. At its last
Brussels Summit in July 2018, the Alliance - also announced the creation
of a new Cyberspace Operations Centre as part of NATO's strengthened
Command Structure. The EU for its part made the fight against cyber-
crime one of the three pillars of the European Agenda on Security, and
recognised cy- bersecurity as a priority for the 2016 Global Strategy
for the European Union's Foreign - and Security Policy. The same year
the EU Directive on the Security of Network and \~ Information Systems
introduced important legal measures to boost the overall lev- : el of
cybersecurity in the EU. In addition, in 2017 Brussels adopted a
'Cybersecurity - \~ Package' including the revised Cybersecurity
Strategy and the introduction of a Cyber : \~ Diplomacy Toolbox.\> In
November 2018 the EU also updated its 2014 Cyber Defence Policy
Framework to strengthen European strategic autonomy in cyberspace.
Finally, \' in May 2019, member states adopted a list of 'EU cyber
sanctions' targeting individuals \~ or groups that engage in
cyberattacks against the bloc. [In this climate of urgency, the EU and
NATO have started to see each other as com- plementary partners in the
endeavour to build up their cyber resilience]{.underline}. In order to
foster operational-level information sharing, NATO and the EU signed a
Technical Arrangement on Cyber Defence in February 2016 between NATO's
Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) and the EU's Computer
Emergency Response Team (CERT). The most significant step was made with
the signing of two EU-NATO Joint Declarations, in July 2016 and in July
2018, that create a concrete framework for coop- eration in the sphere
of security and defence. With regard to cyber, the implementation plan
of the EU-NATO Joint Declarations recognises four areas of cooperation:
integra- tion of cyber defence into missions and operations; training
and education; exercises; and standards. A common set of new proposals
was added in 2017 to foster exchange between staffs' relevant good
practices concerning the cyber aspects and implications of crisis
management and response, as well as operational aspects of cyber
defence, with a view to improving understanding and synergies between
the EU and NATO.\* Since [neither organisation possesses the full range
of capabilities to tackle contem- porary security challenges, there is a
serious incentive for the EU and NATO to cooperate in times of
crisis]{.underline}. And in the field of cybersecurity and defence the
past few years have indeed brought significant change. [The EU and NATO
share many of the **same priorities in cyberspace**, their policies are
largely identical --- based on the principles of resilience, deterrence
and defence --- and their tools are becoming increasingly
complementar]{.underline}y. Active interaction in the field of cyber has
significantly improved with exchanges be- tween staffs on concepts and
doctrines, information on training and education courses, ad-hoc
exchanges on threat assessments, cross-briefings, including on the cyber
as- pects of crisis management and regular meetings, and featuring an
annual high-level EU-NATO staff-to-staff dialogue.® Another concrete
achievement is the fact that since 2017 the EU and NATO flagship crisis
management exercises --- respectively called EU PACE and NATO CMX - are
being coordinated and held in parallel with options for mu- tual
participation of EU and NATO staffs. **[Coordinating EU PACE and NATO
CMX reflects the overall desire to develop more interaction between both
organisations.]{.underline}**

[In a more and more connected world cyberspace has become the **fifth
battlespace**]{.underline}. The [latest Pegasus case]{.underline},
refereeing to a spying hardware which affected many European heads of
states and government in the Summer of 2021, [shows how much cyber
threats are now part of the international security arena]{.underline}.
NATO has tackled the cyber topic for over a decade. NATO's awareness
towards cyber threats started raising in the late 1990s, following
cyberattacks by Serbian hackers against NATO Supreme Command's (SHAPE)
website during the air bombing campaign on Serbian positions in the
frame of the Kosovo war. The [cyberattacks against Estonia
in]{.underline} 20[07 and]{.underline} in the context of the [conflict
in Georgia in]{.underline} 20[08]{.underline} [urged the Alliance to
take]{.underline} this [new threats seriously]{.underline}. NATO is
today the most advanced international organisation regarding cyber
defence. With a cyber command structure set up in 2008, its [2010
Strategic Concept has enabled it to lay the foundations of its vision
for cyber defence]{.underline}. Indeed NATO frames cyber threats as a
direct challenge for transatlantic and national security as stated in
the 2010 Strategic Concept. The Alliance approved its first Policy on
Cyber Defence in 2008 (revised in 2011 and 2014) and established a Cyber
Defence Management Authority (CDMA) in 2008 and even a Cybersecurity
Operations Centre within NATO Command Structure in 2018. [The Strategic
Concept]{.underline} adopted in November 2010 in Lisbon [fully
acknowledges cyber defence capabilities as a necessity for the
Alliance]{.underline}. NATO [also created tools to prevent cyber-attacks
and cyber o]{.underline}ffensive [c]{.underline}apabilitie[s with a
central objective: to defend the Alliance's own **comm**unication**s**
and **info**rmation **systems** and to arouse its member states'
awareness on the need to protect critical infrastructures implied in
contemporary military operations.]{.underline} At the [NATO Summit in
Wales]{.underline} in September 2014, the organisation crossed a new
important threshold by recognizing cyber defence as part of the
Alliance's core task of collective defence and therefore [included cyber
threats as relevant article V material]{.underline}. This [concretely
means that NATO could trigger]{.underline} the [**article
V**]{.underline} of the Washington Treaty [in case of a massive cyber
attack with lethal implications against one of its members]{.underline}.
Yet such a case would raise the difficult question of the attribution of
the cyberattack. Such an [attribution to a specific]{.underline} state
or state-sponsored [hacker would necessitate a consensus among the
member states within]{.underline} the [N]{.underline}orth
[A]{.underline}tlantic [C]{.underline}ouncil, [which would]{.underline}
probably [make it difficult as it tackles]{.underline} diplomatic
strings and [strategic priorities which]{.underline} keep
[diverg]{.underline}ing [among]{.underline} the [**EU** member
states.]{.underline} Indeed attribution continues to be a competence of
member states until now, and not of NATO as such. Since 2014 NATO
regularly reaffirms the importance of cyber defence as one of the core
tasks of the Alliance, as it has been done during the Alliance's summit
in Brussels in June 2021: NATO endorsed a new Comprehensive Cyber
Defence Policy supporting the three main priorities of the Alliance
(collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security). The
member states also agreed to commit to making use of the full range of
capabilities to actively deter, defend against and counter the full
spectrum of cyber threats at all times. Aside from these policy aspects,
NATO also develops a wide range of tools and capabilities in the area of
cyber defence, with the aim of being able to provide assistance to its
member states in case of cyber-attack. It should also be acknowledged
that NATO owns its information and computer networks used in NATO
military missions, whereas in the case the EU for instance, [the EU
depends on the members states ICT infrastructures for CSDP
missions]{.underline}. NATO set up a specific agency dedicated to cyber
defence in 2012 at its SHAPE headquarters: the NATO Communications and
Information Agency (NCI Agency), which hosts since 2016 a Cyber Security
Operations Center (CyOC) dealing with around 500 cyber incidents each
month and responsible for the cyber defence of NATO's information and
computer infrastructures in the world and on military theatres (like in
Afghanistan until August 2021 for instance). This Cyber Operation Center
should be fully operational in 2023. In addition to these tools the
Alliance created a Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence
(CCDCOE) in Tallinn, which is a research and training facility dealing
with cyber defence education, research and development. The main task of
the Centre is to provide expertise on cyber defence, and organise cyber
exercises involving both NATO Allies and partners. These tools are
completed with NATO's smart defence initiatives entailing cyber defence
aspects and aiming at bringing member states to cooperate to develop and
maintain capabilities they could not afford to develop or alone. The
Alliance develops yearly exercises under the label Cyber Coalition. The
development of NATO cyber capabilities over the last 15 years clearly
shows that NATO started developing its own cyber defence culture. The
organization therefore issued a Cyber Defense Pledge at the Warsaw
summit in 2019 to facilitate cyber cooperation among its member states.
As a follow up, France decided to host the first international
conference in Paris in 2018 gathering the 29 NATO member states and the
Secretary General of the Alliance to urge its allies to keep developing
strategic thinking on cyber issues. Last but not least,
[NATO]{.underline} also [develops]{.underline} an [**important
cooperation** with the EU on cyber defence]{.underline}. [Both
organizations have enhanced their cooperation in cyber defence since
their joint declaration at the Alliance summit]{.underline} in Warsaw
[in 2016.]{.underline} [They regularly organize common training and
exercises and develop information sharing in order to raise
mutual]{.underline}. [Cooperation is even more needed in a context of
**limited financial resources**: some experts suggest using the Berlin
Plus agreements in cyber defence]{.underline}. The [EU and NATO have
also concluded a technical agreement between their response teams for
cyber incidents]{.underline} (NCIRC and CERT-EU) in February 2016 [to
intensify their cooperation on cyber defence]{.underline}. This
[agreement has been enforced to discuss cyber threats in the context
of]{.underline} 2019 [European elections]{.underline} for instance. NATO
also started a partnership with industry through the NATO Industry Cyber
Partnership (NICP). More precisely the Alliance develops links with
computer firms such as Microsoft, Atos, Thales, Cisco or Apple. The
[panorama of NATO's cyberdefence assets shows therefore that the
Alliance takes cyber threats seriously and dedicates resources and
reflection to the topic]{.underline}. [Even though NATO could not decide
itself to trigger article V against a cyber aggressor, its member states
have the **common framework** enabling them to act, should they manifest
the **political will** to do so.]{.underline}

[To **strengthen**]{.underline} inter-organisational [**cyber**
**security** and **cyber** **defence** **cooperation**,]{.underline} the
[**EU** and **NATO** should]{.underline} solve the political blockage,
[develop **joint** **action** plans to be implemented by member states
and do away with]{.underline} technical issues such as [the lack of
**formal** **agreements** between **institutions**]{.underline}. The
work done at staff-to-staff level must now be replicated at the national
level by launching and investing in joint activities and projects that
will increase member states' capabilities. While top representatives
spoke of 'prioritising strengthened cooperation' at the 2016 and 2018
NATO summits, more should be done to generate investments from the
capitals. The following [**policy** **proposals** aim to **designate** a
number of **joint** **activities** with an aim to create more
**substantial** **cooperation** among the member states of both
organisations]{.underline}. A [**strong** **political** support and
**prioritisation** is **necessary** also from the **key**
**capitals**.]{.underline} First and foremost, an EU-NATO working group
on cyber security and defence issues must be established. These topics
must also be regular agenda items in other joint working and high
political level meetings, such as the EUNATO capability development
group and the NAC-PSC meetings. This new working group should discuss
policy themes where [closer cooperation can create **synergy**
(synchronising **crisis** **response** mechanisms, speeding
**political** **decision-making**, developing **joint** **response**
options to **cyberattacks**,]{.underline} etc). [Joint working groups at
the subject matter expert level should explore possibilities to
**develop** **joint** **research** and **innovation** **programmes** and
coordinate **national** and **union-level** **activities** in the area
of **emerging technologies**]{.underline} (including 5G and artificial
intelligence). Joint education and training courses should be created
with the first step of opening all existing courses to each other's
officials and member states. The [EU must be granted observer status at
the Steering Committee of NATO's]{.underline} Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence (**[CCD COE]{.underline}**), as suggested by the
Allied Command Transformation. [Formal cooperation -- including
technical arrangements for **information sharing** -- must also be
established with]{.underline} ENISA and other [relevant EU
bodies]{.underline} (such as the Cybersecurity Research and Competence
Centre and EU-CERT) in order [to facilitate participating in each
other's exercises]{.underline}. [Closer cooperation between **research
and competence** centres is needed to **jointly develop** doctrine and
concepts, and launch **common research** projects]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} areas such as [**cyber activities** in the grey space,
**supply chain security**, **military dependencies** on civilian
**critical infrastructure**]{.underline} (such as energy, transport and
finance), including how do develop common methodology to assess
inter-dependencies. The [NATO Cyber Defence Pledge could also be applied
to **non-NATO EU countries**]{.underline} and possibly in third
countries. The [resiliency requirements and cyber security standards of
the EU and NATO should be complementary]{.underline} and ensure the
minimum common level of protection in all countries. Information sharing
between the organisations has been improved but more should be done to
create joint threat assessments and intelligence sharing for attribution
of cyberattacks. The EU and NATO should continue synchronising their
hybrid threats playbooks with a view to creating joint responses. [They
must also synchronise cyber defence capabilities development **roadmaps
and experiences**]{.underline} on improving civilmilitary information
sharing. One way forward is through joint EU-NATO joint exercises, be
they technical, crisis management or table-top style. The table-top
exercises at the subject matter expert and ambassadors, foreign and
defence ministers level should explore the application of EU's cyber
diplomacy toolbox and joint response options. [More joint action is also
needed to promote the **application of international law**, confidence
building measures, and state responsible behaviour in
cyberspace]{.underline}. [Both organisations should create common cyber
capability **building programmes**, including **joint trust
funds**]{.underline}, for the third countries. In the area of cyber
defence, the EU and NATO should explore options on how to use the
sovereign effects of the NATO Cyberspace Operations Centre with a view
to support future EU missions and operations. PESCO's recent 'Cyber
Rapid Response Team' initiative -- comprised of nine participating EU
member states -- could be deployed to assist non-EU NATO countries and
third countries to prevent, detect and respond to cyber incidents.

NATO and the EU address capability development in markedly different
ways. NATO focuses more on procuring a given item from a given state to
meet a specific need of the alliance, whereas the EU focuses more on
filling capability gaps and encouraging member states to cooperate to
develop new assets. In this regard, the EU appears to have a comparative
advantage given the role of the European Defense Agency to go beyond
specific operational requirements and its ability to consider long-term
trends and ways member states can cooperate on the development of new
capabilities. In particular, the EU defense procurement benefits from
strong support from EU-led research and development programs, as well as
from considerable financial resources from the European Defense Fund.
[As European defense capabilities advance]{.underline}, there will be
overlap between the EU Capability Development Priorities and the NATO
Defense Planning Process; [this gives the EU and NATO an opportunity to
foster **greater cooperation and build up a more efficient and
competitive trans-atlantic defense**]{.underline}.73 A recent study from
the French Institute of International Relations identifies areas where
[defense requirements could be harmonized]{.underline} and where [the EU
and NATO could work on joint research projects: from
**cyberdefense**,]{.underline} air superiority, logistics, and medical
support capabilities to science and technology, arms control, and
intelligence.74 [A more synchronized approach in these
areas]{.underline} --- that would also entail a joint assessment of
member state performances --- **[will undoubtedly reinforce both NATO-
and EU-led operations as well as deterrence.]{.underline}** Such an
approach to procurement could prove particularly helpful [given the
rising threats]{.underline} coming from vulnerabilities in the global
supply chain. The COVID-19 pandemic has unveiled [Western countries'
strong dependency on Chinese supplies]{.underline}, both in the medical
and technological fields (though the supply issues around personal
protective equipment were addressed relatively rapidly).75 A recent
study by the Mercator Institute for China Studies identifies 103
categories of electronics, chemical, mineral/metal, and pharmaceutical
products in which the EU is critically dependent on imports from
China.76 At the same time, as [economies worldwide have started to
recover from the pandemic]{.underline} and embark on ambitious
investment plans to boost innovation in their national industries, the
demand for semiconductors --- crucial for building microchips, which are
essential in any modern technology --- has increased and become [one of
the central issues of the U.S.-China competition]{.underline}. This
issue is further complicated by geopolitical concerns; a large
proportion of semiconductor manufacturing occurs in Taiwan.77 The U.S.
and the EU have recently begun initiatives to increase the domestic
production of microchips. In June, the U.S. Senate passed the Creating
Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act,
which allocates \$52 billion toward the effort.78 And the EU followed
suit with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen committing
to a similar amount.79 The U.S. and EU discussed the issue during their
inaugural Trade and Technology Council (TTC) meeting in Pittsburg,
Pennsylvania, in September 2021.80 These discussions represent a first
step toward breaking the ice on trans-Atlantic cooperation, particularly
related to developing new technologies that are vital for enhancing
geopolitical and economic security. But the main takeaways are that the
U.S. and the EU are facing the same challenges and that the EU has
increased its geopolitical ambition and range of interests. So far,
[there is no similar dialogue platform between NATO and the EU --- a
fact that hinders inter-institutional cooperation in the procurement
domain.]{.underline} In fact, [if NATO and the EU develop different
standards, it could lead to duplication and hinder logistical and
strategic interoperability across the trans-Atlantic space.]{.underline}
For this reason, [it is especially **important for NATO and the EU to
establish deeper communication**]{.underline} on procurement and the
definition of common standards. Increasing connections and synergies
between industrial clusters within the trans-Atlantic space,
particularly for materials such as semiconductors and microchips, would
decrease dependence on geopolitically risky supply chains. Moreover,
[developing common standards]{.underline} when it comes to procurement,
data privacy, and weaponry components [would facilitate technological
exchanges as well as the interoperability of equipment]{.underline} (be
it **[artificial intelligence]{.underline}** or more traditional
military supplies) [across the NATO-EU space.]{.underline} Given the
increasing importance of new technologies for economic development,
industrial advancement, and innovation, the only alternative to a shared
approach in the trans-Atlantic space would be increased competition
among allies and reduced interoperability --- which would inevitably
create more advantages for competitors to exploit.

A WORLD OF BIOLOGICAL POSSIBILITIES Mutual [self-interest
provides]{.underline} a [strong basis for transatlantic
coop]{.underline}eration [in biotech]{.underline}nology [based on shared
recognition of its vast potential to provide solutions to some of
civilization's most pressing problems]{.underline}. Thanks to explosive
advances in our understanding of the many ways in which promiscuous
nature has been manipulating DNA and RNA for the past billion years, it
is widely anticipated that the 21st century will belong to biology.1 [We
are]{.underline} now [at the point where our ability to innovate is
constrained less by technical capability than by the limits of our
imaginations]{.underline}. Multiple [lab]{.underline}oratorie[s and
companies on both sides of the Atlantic]{.underline} (and throughout the
world) [are pursuing]{.underline} promising [applications]{.underline},
[and experience confirms progress would be **accelerated** by
cooperative approaches]{.underline}. But there are some considerable
challenges, especially in agricultural and industrial contexts. The most
important rate-limiting factor in our ability to harness biological
innovations to the challenges of feeding the world, sustaining human and
environmental health, and addressing climate change, is the burden
imposed by ill-considered regulations. Unless this bottleneck can be
unblocked, the enormous potential for transatlantic scientific
cooperation will not yield the necessary fruits. DIVERGENT REGULATORY
PATHS: PRECAUTION VS. OPENNESS TO INNOVATION [Existing
policies]{.underline}, [legislation]{.underline}, [and
reg]{.underline}ulation[s do little]{.underline} or nothing [to advance
human or environmental safety]{.underline}.2 Born out of understandable
caution at the dawn of recombinant DNA technologies, today their most
obvious impact is to obstruct and discourage research, development, and
deployment of innovative solutions to various challenges.3 This is so
despite an abundant record of production and consumption of new biotech
products with enviable records of improved safety, superior
sustainability, and widespread beneficial economic impacts.4 The
benefits are so substantial that a pattern has emerged of farmers
breaking the law to acquire and plant improved seeds in countries where
governments have lagged in allowing access.5 It is one thing to
implement policies and regulations ostensibly designed to ensure safety;
it is quite another to ignore vast data and decades of experience around
the world to maintain obsolete policies and regulations that add nothing
to safety or sustainability, but only impede our ability to use the most
innovative, precise, and safest tools to address our gravest
challenges.6 In terms of regulatory policy and openness to biological
innovations, the width of the Atlantic might be measured better in light
years than miles or kilometers. [As imperfect as
reg]{.underline}ulation[s]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the products of
[biotech]{.underline}nology [are in]{.underline} North
[America]{.underline}, [they are]{.underline} simply [**indefensible**
in Europe]{.underline}.7 The United States decided in 1986, after years
of study and consultation, that no new laws were required to ensure the
safety of crops and foods improved through biotechnology. This was based
on the finding that they present no novel hazards, and foreseeable risks
of their development and use fall into categories with which humans have
considerable experience from millennia of conventional plant and animal
breeding.8 The United States therefore decided to regulate these novel
products under existing authorities administered by the Department of
Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and Environmental
Protection Agency.9 While implementation of this policy, the
"Coordinated Framework," has been far from perfect, it has been
sufficiently predictable and science-based to enable an explosion of
innovation, new product development, and commercial activity.
Consequently, the United States has led the world to the present day
wherein crops improved through biotechnology are now the global standard
for quality seeds, delivering improved yields, safety, sustainability,
and economic productivity around the world, with the lion's share of
benefits accruing on behalf of small farmers in developing countries.10
Europe took a different approach. It is one thing to implement policies
and regulations ostensibly designed to ensure safety; it is quite
another to ignore vast data and decades of experience around the world
to maintain obsolete policies and regulations that add nothing to safety
or sustainability. [The E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion
[decided to regulate seeds]{.underline} improved [through
biotech]{.underline}nology as a novel class governed under new
regulations specifically focused on an arbitrary category known as
"GMOs" (for "genetically modified organisms"). The conceit was that
because they represented gene combinations produced by mechanisms
supposedly "not found in nature" (but actually ubiquitous) they must
present novel hazards, even though none has ever been identified. These
putatively novel hazards, despite the lack of any concrete
manifestations, allegedly required dedicated, specific, "precautionary"
regulations. The resulting regulatory regime proved so burdensome it led
to the general collapse of agricultural biotechnology in Europe, which
had played a leading role in its discovery and invention. Permissions
for field trials proved almost impossible to obtain, products could not
be developed and brought to market, academic labs abandoned the field,
and the industry relocated most of its assets and activities to the
Americas. And Europe became the world's largest importer of commodity
foods improved through biotechnology, only recently surpassed by China.
OPPORTUNITY FOR TRANSATLANTIC COOPERATION Many [scientists in the
EU]{.underline} (and around the world) [knew from the beginning that
this was the **wrong approach**]{.underline}, [yet the EU pushed its
model internationally, with aggressive diplomacy, leading to emulation
by many countries in the developing world, with equally unhappy results
to those seen in Europe]{.underline}.11 [But a growing number of
scientists, policymakers, and even "green" NGOs that had originally
opposed GMOs, now recognize the counterproductive results of this
approach and are **working to avoid** repeating the same mistakes with
gene editing]{.underline}. [This shines a spotlight on the most
important and potentially fruitful opportunity for transatlantic
cooperation in biotechnology: the **revival** of **science-based**
regulatory regimes in which the degree of regulatory **oversight** is
**proportional** to the **hazards** involved, and regulation that
enables]{.underline}, rather than discourages [the safe development of
innovative products.]{.underline} [A return to and reaffirmation of
these first principles would provide fertile ground for **cooperation**
and **coordination globally**.]{.underline} Regulatory reform
(everywhere, not just in the EU and its emulators, though the need is
greatest there) provides fertile ground for transatlantic cooperation
and coordination. We have robust models of proven approaches.12 [Without
such cooperation, other progress in developing and deploying innovative
solutions through biotechnology will be **impeded** or
**foregone**.]{.underline} As to national security risks, just as with
other risks, novelty attributable to biotechnology is elusive. One can
do very nasty things with conventional bioweapons, and they are easily
magnified with recombinant DNA techniques. At the same time, defensive
capacities are also buttressed by biotechnology, as demonstrated by the
rapid development of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. There has been
some good work done in this area, but this topic is worth exploring at
greater depth. The OECD has a track record of thoughtful analyses with
such topics. One possibility would be to build on that foundation by
establishing a joint OECD/NATO working group to serve as a forum.

IMPORTANCE OF COOPERATING IN EMERGING THEATERS [As the pressure from
China and Russia rises]{.underline} and amplifies the threats posed by
traditional challenges, the EU and NATO's partners have little to gain
from division and a lack of coordination. The time has come to identify
new and better ways to [fill security gaps and effectively allocate
resources to ensure readiness]{.underline} on a variety of fronts.
Moreover, to enhance coordination, each organization should consider how
to add value to the other organization in both the military and
non-military domains. At least four dimensions of the current security
debate are crucial [to strengthening the NATO-EU partnership: increasing
European military capability, improving military mobility and
interoperability, sharpening cooperation in the cyber and disinformation
space, and finding synergies in procurement]{.underline} [through the
securitization of technology and supply chains. **A stronger European
defense to strengthen NATO**]{.underline}'s posture While the EU has
made significant progress in countering hybrid warfare since Russia's
annexation of Crimea, the same cannot be said with regard to [developing
more effective traditional deterrence capabilities.]{.underline} Such
[capabilities are increasingly necessary,]{.underline} not just [because
of Russia's aggressive posture]{.underline} --- expanding its area of
operations beyond the post-Soviet space to Syria and Africa --- but also
[because of the growing geopolitical and security alignment between
Beijing and Moscow.]{.underline} Since 2014, cooperation between [China
and Russia]{.underline} has expanded beyond the domain of arm sales. The
two countries [have supported each other's development of strategic
weapons]{.underline} (such as for missile defense) and artificial
intelligence, as well as each other's political positions in the United
Nations Security Council.41 Beijing and Moscow have deepened their
interactions in Africa, where Russian Wagner Group mercenaries patrol
Chinese facilities,42 and conducted military exercises including a
shared air patrol in the Asia-Pacific region.43 They also have been
seeking common ground on Afghanistan since the departure of U.S.
troops.44 Such alignment is increasingly resembling a partnership that
is reflected at the military level too. After the past year's military
drills in the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, and the Indo-Pacific, China
and Russia recently conducted a joint military exercise called
Zapad/Interaction-2021 in China's northwestern region of Ningxia, where
for the first time they used a joint command and control system and
shared equipment --- [mimicking the way NATO forces work with each
other.45]{.underline} Meanwhile, [the United States has begun to shift
its security focus toward the IndoPacific region and South China Sea
where Beijing is threatening Taiwan]{.underline}. Consequently, [should
a direct confrontation with China occur in the medium to long term,
Russia could take advantage of the situation and potentially target
Europe while U.S. forces and attentions are directed
elsewhere.]{.underline} For this reason, [it is **crucial for European
allies** to have the **military capabilities to push back against Russia
with little support from the United States**,]{.underline} at least in
the initial phases. [With more defense capabilities, European allies
would also have the resources to respond to crises that arise in the
Mediterranean region.]{.underline} After four years of strained
trans-Atlantic relations --- where the defense spending issue has
intoxicated the broader debate on trans-Atlantic security --- a stronger
European defense would help Washington recognize the increased
geopolitical cohesion and security concerns of the bloc. Unfortunately,
as described earlier, **[such capability has yet to be
achieved.]{.underline}** A RAND Corporation wargaming simulation
exercise assessed that in the case of a conventional attack by the
Russian Federation, Moscow's forces would be able to reach the outskirts
of either the Estonian or Latvian capital in around 60 hours, and the
NATO allies would not be able to defend these territories because of a
(totally fillable) shortage of military capabilities.46 Similarly, a
scenario analysis by the International Institute for Strategic Studies
argued that without the help of the United States, conventional forces
from European NATO countries would not be able to push back against the
hypothetical conquest of Lithuania and part of Poland by the Russian
Federation.47 [To ensure that they can successfully respond to a land
attack from Russia, or **a coordinated Russia-China operation**,
Europeans need to increase the quality and readiness of their defense
apparatus.]{.underline} A policy brief by the NATO Defense College calls
for multinational battlegroups in Poland and in the Baltics to increase
their readiness in terms of support capabilities, such as artillery and
air defense, and for European allies to fulfill their NATO 2018
Readiness commitment of providing several land combat brigades and
maritime task groups.48 The authors also point out that [to increase
deterrence,]{.underline} European allies need sufficient and effective
air and missile defense capabilities to [protect critical
infrastructure]{.underline}, as well as long-range conventional
precision-strike weapons to limit Russia's options for regional
conventional attacks. All these analyses indicate that **[expanded
capabilities on the European side are crucial for a stronger NATO
posture]{.underline}**. Political tensions around the branding of
European strategic autonomy have unfortunately poisoned this debate and
complicated a very simple issue: [European forces must be able to take
effective action]{.underline} with or [**without the United States** in
the theaters that are crucial for European security.]{.underline}

Leveraged EU advantages in the hybrid domain Although progress has been
slow on the traditional military side, [the European Union has proved to
be a versatile asset for other aspects of security, specifically in
the]{.underline} political and [hybrid domains.]{.underline} Diplomatic
and regulatory approaches are primary political tools to push back
against autocracies. Despite its members having different strategic
foreign policy priorities, the European Union has established a solid
diplomatic posture in defense of European values and interests. For
example, learning from its reaction to the Russo-Georgian War in 2008,
the EU was able to create a united front following Russia's incursions
in Ukraine in 2014 and has imposed sanctions still in place today ---
for example, in response to the annexation of Crimea, the downing of
Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine, and more recently the
poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. [On China, the
European Union has acted consistently, based on its labeling of the
country as both an economic competitor and a strategic
rival.]{.underline} The EU has pursued commercial deals while also
heavily regulating Chinese foreign direct investment in sensitive
sectors of European interest. More meaningfully, the EU has repeatedly
condemned China for its human rights abuses in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and
Taiwan and has announced a ban on products made with forced labor.57
While [NATO is reinventing itself in the face of pressing challenges
like China and climate change,58 the EU has advanced in tackling
cybersecurity, regulating and exploring new technologies and developing
its Indo-Pacific strategy.]{.underline}59 The [EU's advantages over NATO
in the diplomatic and economic domains,]{.underline} especially when it
comes to crisis management and political pressure, [should be taken into
account in broader discussion of NATO-EU coordination]{.underline}.
**[Sharpened cooperation on disinformation and cyber]{.underline}** The
[countering of disinformation is one key area where the European Union
offers added value to international security.]{.underline} Since 2014
--- and particularly following the disinformation operations carried out
by Russia-sponsored media during the Brexit referendum and the U.S.
presidential elections in 2016 as well as the French presidential
elections in 2017 --- [the EU has set up a solid structure to monitor,
detect, and counter disinformation]{.underline}. The EU was [the first
to establish a dedicated task force]{.underline}, the EU StratCom,
within the European External Action Service (EEAS) to combat
disinformation in the Eastern Partnership countries (Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine). Subsequently, the
European Commission established ground rules for online platforms and
the advertising and social media industries, including a Code of
Practice on Disinformation and guidelines on accountability
obligations.60 The EU also has set up important monitoring activities,
such as the Digital Media Observatory and the COVID-19 monitoring and
reporting program, to function as a European hub for fact-checkers. A
crucial part of these efforts is included in the Action Plan Against
Disinformation that sets up a Rapid Alert System to facilitate
information sharing and a unified response across the European
institutions.61 [Compared to the EU, NATO's approach to combatting
disinformation is less robust and limited in scope]{.underline}. NATO
has set up tracking and monitoring activities --- which offer
fact-checking findings and counternarratives, including in the Russian
language --- but it has mostly relied on its Public Diplomacy Division
which only monitors NATO-related material. For example, during the first
few months after the outbreak of COVID-19, the division set up a section
on its website called "NATO-Russia: Setting the record straight"; the
website addresses the top five myths circulated by Russian propaganda
regarding NATO's connection with and reaction to the spread of
COVID-19.62 Also established by NATO --- but operationally independent
--- the StratCom Center of Excellence (COE) in Riga, Latvia brings
together civilian and military stakeholders to conduct research on the
use of modern technologies and to develop virtual tools for analyses,
research, and decisionmaking. Hence, the center has produced valuable
material for NATO's Public Diplomacy Division. In addition, the StratCom
COE has worked with the EEAS StratCom task force to train EU staff on
how to respond to simulated disinformation attacks and responses. More
recently, in 2019, the EU and NATO started exchanging information
through the inclusion of NATO's international staff in the EU Rapid
Alert System, as well as through dialogues, staff and information
exchanges and training exercises, including briefings between the EEAS
StratCom and NATO Public Diplomacy Division.63 [These are important
efforts that highlight NATO and the EU's openness to dialogue and mutual
learning experiences]{.underline}. But [they are nowhere near enough to
keep up with the network of disinformation,]{.underline} where
[techniques are rapidly evolving]{.underline} and [taking advantage of
artificial intelligence]{.underline}. While [China and Russia are
reinforcing each other's narratives]{.underline} through multiple
channels, the effects of malign foreign influence in the disinformation
domain are now being compounded by homegrown disinformation networks
using the same pattern of exploiting people's fear and vulnerability.
Evidence of this occurring includes the spread of anti-vaccination
propaganda as well as antidemocratic propaganda (which helped spur the
assault on the U.S. Capitol in January 2021).64 **[Given the growing
vulnerabilities in the trans-Atlantic space, NATO and the EU should join
forces and expand their activity from countering disinformation to a
preventing effort.]{.underline}** The EU can add value in increasing the
involvement of the private sector, and NATO can add value in using its
intelligence capabilities in the counterterrorism domain to identify
troll factories and disinformation sources. More broadly on cyber,
despite advancements in their own jurisdictions, the [paths of NATO and
the EU have not crossed much yet]{.underline}. The two organizations
have a different approach to cyber issues: While the EU aims to develop
resilience against cyber threats, NATO has a broader and forward-looking
approach that aims to prevent cyberattacks and to use cyber as an
offensive tool to tackle threats and create deterrence.65 For example,
the EU is seeking to strengthen its cyber posture through an EU
Cybersecurity Strategy. The first piece of corresponding legislation,
the EU Network and Information Security Directive (EU 2016/1148),
established substantial cybersecurity standards that member states must
adopt to protect critical sectors.66 Meanwhile, in its latest summit
communiqué, NATO stated that "a decision as to when a cyber-attack would
lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic
Council on a case-by-case basis," thus highlighting the increased
awareness of the security implication of cyberattacks on critical
infrastructure.67 Despite their different approaches, both NATO and the
EU included cyber in their 2016 cooperation frameworks and started a
series of joint exercises between the EU's 2017 Parallel and Coordinated
Exercise and NATO's 2017 Crisis Management Exercise, as well as more
recent exercises like those conducted through the CYBERSEC 2019 forum.68
However, while incredibly valuable, such exercises have not gone much
beyond staffto-staff interactions and joint workshops. Understandably,
cybersecurity cooperation implies a significant amount of intelligence
sharing, which is ultimately impeded by a lack of trust stemming from
political tensions and by the national security concerns of individual
member states. In addition to [establishing a more substantial channel
for intelligence sharing to immediately warn allies about a cyberattack
and prevent domino effects, other smaller steps could help increase
cooperation and strengthen resilience]{.underline} in the trans-Atlantic
space. For instance, the establishment of [common standards related to
threat and resilience capabilities]{.underline} could, in the event of a
cyberattack, [facilitate talks between]{.underline} [allies]{.underline}
and [improve]{.underline} the [interoperability]{.underline} of
infrastructure. Within the United Nations, there are already two working
groups trying to advance international legislation and standards
covering the cybersecurity space.69 In line with these efforts, NATO and
the EU could [adopt similar standards that also help integrate and
reinforce their complementary cybersecurity strategies]{.underline}. In
particular, [NATO could look at the existing EU regulatory framework and
adopt similar strategies and resilience practices across the alliance,
and the EU could benefit from NATO's vast military experience and
capabilities]{.underline} that are relevant to the cyber domain in order
to [bolster the security aspect of the EU's cybersecurity
strategy.]{.underline}

Americans who are truly committed to the idea of a Europe "whole and
free" should realize that [NATO is no longer the **main spinal cord** of
the European project]{.underline}; [the **E**uropean **U**nion
is]{.underline}. When George H. W. Bush coined the phrase in 1989, the
level of intra-European integration was arguably on par with the defense
alliance as providing stability and prosperity to the continent, and
Americans were still heavily involved in both. Remember, this was
pre-Maastricht Treaty, before the EU itself. Three decades of political,
economic, and monetary integration later --- and 16 new members later
--- the European Union is deeply entrenched in the lives of Europeans.
Today, [28 European democracies]{.underline}, which used to compete
among themselves and sometimes fight to their ultimate demise, now
choose to [pool sovereignty and have]{.underline} their [interests
**communally discussed** and **collectively defended**]{.underline}. The
[EU is a **power multiplier**]{.underline}: [Every one of the 28 has a
**stronger individual voice**]{.underline} because they stand together
in the European Union. [Small European countries]{.underline}, whose
geography and demography would force them to cave to stronger neighbors,
can now [count on the **solidarity** of the group]{.underline} --- as
illustrated by the unwavering support for Ireland by the other 26 member
states and the Brussels institutions in the Brexit negotiations. The
neighbors of the European Union are no fools. Those who seek prosperity
and stability hope to join the EU club. Those who reject the model set
by the West and liberal democracies feel threatened by the European
Union --- it is the prospect of Ukraine moving into the EU's orbit
through an Association Agreement that triggered Russia's hostility and
ultimate aggression, not NATO. The power of attraction of the [European
Union]{.underline}, at least as much as the security guarantees of NATO,
has helped [stabilize Eastern Europe]{.underline}. [Despite these
realities]{.underline}, [Americans]{.underline} often [indulge
in]{.underline} a [**scornful disregard** for the EU]{.underline}.
Recently, [benign contempt]{.underline} has [taken an **ugly
turn**]{.underline}. Since taking office, President Trump and his
administration have attacked the European Union and individual member
states repeatedly, with near impunity. At first sight, American
complaints appear to be centered on the issue of Europe's trading power,
which rivals that of the United States. For Donald Trump, the EU was
created to "take advantage of" the United States and it is "worse than
China." Early in his mandate, the American president pushed for tariffs
on steel and aluminum and threatened to go after automobiles, until a
meeting with EU Commission President Juncker put a brake on the downward
spiral. However, a deeper look reveals a fundamental ideological
contention: The brand of nationalism and populism that defines this
administration stands in direct contradiction with the very existence of
a liberal, supra-national body such as the European Union. As laid out
by the State Department's Director of Policy Planning Kiron Skinner in
December 2018, the administration holds the view that "international
institutions have steadily encroached on the rights of sovereign
nations" and that "nothing can replace the nation-state as the guarantor
of democratic freedoms and national interests" --- an indictment of the
EU's very existence. The ideological clash is reminiscent of older
times. Addressing a crowd in Warsaw in July 2017, President Trump
likened the European Union to the Soviet Union, criticizing a similar
"steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and
wealth of the people," an equivalency popular in conservative circles.
Similarly, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggested in a December 2018
speech in Brussels that EU bureaucrats were not really working for the
interests of European citizens. By making no secret of his personal
support for euroskeptic forces, Donald Trump has become an active
political opponent of the European Union in its existing form. He
celebrated the Brexit vote, expressed support for far-right candidate
Marine Le Pen ahead of the French presidential elections, disparaged
Angela Merkel repeatedly, and appeared to rejoice at the Yellow Vests
protest movement. He criticized Theresa May for negotiating a "soft"
Brexit, and even recommended to Emmanuel Macron that France leave the
EU. The American president has nominated ambassadors famously critical
of the EU, and his administration demoted the EU ambassador's status
without notification, before reversing under criticism. As Donald Trump
torments both the Atlantic alliance and the European Union, all rush to
NATO's bedside, and few worry about the EU. Truthfully, Atlanticists
love to love NATO. It stands for values, valor, unity, solidarity. NATO
won the Cold War. Celebrating NATO is celebrating the military. It is
much harder to love the EU, the bureaucracy, the politics, the
regulations. The EU lacks democratic appeal, and its slow-moving
decisionmaking process create many frustrations. Unlike in NATO, the
United States sits on the sidelines, it does not control who enters, or
who stays in. The EU is also an economic peer competitor, a tough
trading partner, and a sovereign international actor, at times
non-compliant with American demands. Yet, the [prospect of]{.underline}
an [implosion of the **E**uropean **U**nion]{.underline} should be as
[unbearable and intolerable]{.underline} to an American audience as the
dissolution of NATO --- or more so, as no one wants to see the [demons
of nationalism back on the European continent]{.underline}, along with a
[global economic catastrophe]{.underline}. Benign [neglect is
**counterproductive**]{.underline}; but a [policy **openly hostile** to
the **E**uropean **U**nion is a **grave mistake**]{.underline}. In a
world where the strongmen are striking back, [Americans should not
forget]{.underline} that [the European Union]{.underline} stands with
the United States when it matters most. The NATO summit in Washington
this week should be the occasion to recall not only the utmost
importance of the Atlantic alliance to trans-Atlantic security, but also
the crucial contribution of the European Union to peace, unity, and
ultimately security for Europe and beyond.

In the summer and early fall of 2021, two [incidents cast doubt on the
United States' future commitment to European security]{.underline}. The
first was the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan despite the
objections of NATO allies. The second was United States' negotiation of
the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal with Australia and the United Kingdom
without informing France. (France had an agreement with the Australian
government to build diesel-propelled submarines.)1 [Europeans were
furious.]{.underline} Charles Michel, president of the European Council,
said, "What does it mean America is back? [Is America back in
America]{.underline} or somewhere else? We don't know... We are
**[observing a clear lack of transparency and loyalty]{.underline}**."2
European Commissioner Thierry Breton, who is French, spoke of "a
[growing feeling in Europe... that **something is broken in our
transatlantic relations**" and called for a "pause]{.underline} and a
reset."3 [These twin shocks created a new demand for]{.underline} what
is intermittently called [**European strategic autonomy** --- the notion
that **the European Union should be more capable of acting on its own**
in pursuit of Europe's interests.]{.underline} While France champions
this idea, other European nations are more reluctant, especially those
physically closer to Russia who see the United States as the key
security provider. France argues that **[a greater role for the European
Union is compatible with a continuing vital role for NATO in European
security,]{.underline}** but this begs the question of how the two
organizations --- NATO and the EU --- relate to each other.

As with the cyber domain, [NATO and the EU could]{.underline} respond to
outside pressure by [increasing and improving procurement and
technological cooperation]{.underline}. The COVID-19 pandemic has
triggered shortages and vulnerabilities in the supply chain, and the
competition for rare earth material and high-technology products (such
as microchips) has increased. Meanwhile, [breakthrough technological
achievements are opening new frontiers]{.underline} for competition [in
the security domain.]{.underline} First, [European allies could better
coordinate their defense spending within]{.underline} the framework of
[the European Union]{.underline}; [the]{.underline} [absence of an
integrated defense structure]{.underline} inevitably [leads to
duplications and wasted]{.underline} [resources]{.underline}. Moreover,
the armed forces of different European countries may encounter
difficulties in operating with one another, given that [there are 138
defense systems in Europe (compared to only 30 in the United
States]{.underline}).70 As stated in a European Commission report, the
[lack of cooperation in the European defense industry produces a loss of
25 billion to **100 billion euros per year**]{.underline}, while [30% of
the costs could be saved if a joint procurement was in
place.]{.underline}71

## Competition

### A2: Perm DB

#### Perm links to the NBs because it requires US action and leadership. The CP doesn't mandate US resources or focus and certainly wouldn't be perceived as US action. 

#### Perm doesn't solve European autonomy benefits -- US and European interests are mutually exclusive.

The [transatlantic alliance has had a bad four years]{.underline}. The
[Trump administration's]{.underline} criticism of the United Nations and
the World Trade Organization, the president's [threats to leave NATO,
and his active criticism of the EU all made Europeans wonder whether
they had lost their most important partner]{.underline}. Moreover, [in
light of the conflict over 5G, in the minds of many Europeans,
technology in particular has become an area that creates **conflict** in
the transatlantic relationship rather than fostering cooperation.
Although transatlantic relations are likely to improve under Biden,
**substantial damage** has been done]{.underline}, and it will take some
time to mend these ties. But, **[even if]{.underline}** [relations
improve, it is becoming increasingly obvious that US has a **diminishing
interest** in Europe as a geopolitically important part of the
world]{.underline}. This [trend]{.underline} was [already visible
under]{.underline} Trump's predecessor, Barack [Obama]{.underline}. It
is, therefore, unsurprising that, [on technology cooperation, both sides
emphasise the importance of working with **other actors**]{.underline}
as well as each other. The US National Security Commission on AI, for
example, recommends that the US Departments of State and Defense "should
negotiate formal AI cooperation agreements with Australia, India, Japan,
New Zealand, South Korea, and Vietnam". Its March 2020 report emphasises
on several occasions the importance of the Five Eyes intelligence
alliance. Meanwhile, [Europeans are pursuing the idea of an alliance for
multilateralism]{.underline}. And, [on technology and AI]{.underline}
more specifically, they have also begun to reach out [to]{.underline}
**[other]{.underline}** [democratic allies]{.underline}. European
digital autonomy The most important aspect of transatlantic
estrangement, however, is not the loss of trust between the US and
Europe -- which they will eventually reverse. Rather, during the four
years of the Trump administration, and partly [in response to
isolationist tendencies in the US, Europeans have become much more
comfortable talking about European **strategic autonomy** or
sovereignty]{.underline}. Without encouraging the narrative that these
efforts are directed against the US, or were primarily an answer to
Trump, [Europeans aim to empower Europe as an actor in its own
right]{.underline}. [In the technological realm, this led to the idea of
European **digital sovereignty**, the aim of which is to build up
European technological capabilities.]{.underline} Although [European
digital sovereignty]{.underline} is not specifically targeted at the US,
it [has led]{.underline}, among other things, [to efforts such as the
possible regulation of American technology companies and concerns over
American firms acquiring European start-ups. European campaigners and
some policymakers believe US tech giants]{.underline} such as Google,
Apple, Facebook, and Amazon [are forces to protect
**against**]{.underline}. [European thinking on technology partly
developed in **opposition** to the US and US companies]{.underline}.
Thus, European efforts to build up digital sovereignty may impede
transatlantic cooperation.

#### The perm will just result in EU dependence and the US will crowd them out -- means no defense autonomy and worse cooperation.

A weak European military [European defense spending]{.underline},
specifically related to nations [falling short of the NATO 2% of GDP
target, has been a major issue in U.S.-EU relations]{.underline}. While
Barack Obama's administration exerted diplomatic pressure, [Donald
Trump's engaged in open confrontation on this issue]{.underline}.
[Neither administration obtained significant results]{.underline},
however; and as Afghanistan has shown, [Europe is still far too reliant
on the military protection of the United States --- an issue that
**weakens NATO's posture**]{.underline}. Over the past few years, the
[EU]{.underline} has strengthened both its legal and financial
mechanisms to be more competitive on the security side. In December
2017, under [articles 42.6 and 46 of the Lisbon Treaty]{.underline}, the
European Council [established a Permanent Structured Cooperation
mechanism to deepen cooperation between willing member
states]{.underline}. These [states have agreed to binding commitments on
investment, planning and management to advance their defense
capabilities in the service of both national and multinational
operations (including those of NATO and the UN).]{.underline} PESCO
currently has 46 projects in several domains, from training to maritime
and land exercises to cyber and military mobility.33 [Through the
European Defense Fund, the EU also has allocated 7.9 billion euros
(roughly \$9 billion)]{.underline} for the 2021-2027 period [to research
**innovative defense products** and **technologies** through collaborate
development projects]{.underline}.34 But [while these initiatives
represent a **step** toward better European coordination on defense
issues, they are completely reliant on political will and
**inter-governmental coordination**]{.underline} --- as security is not
a competence of the EU but an inalienable prerogative of its member
states. In fact, many of the PESCO projects appear to be severely
delayed.35 [U.S. experts]{.underline} interviewed for this research also
[point out the bad shape of European defense and more broadly its
dependence on the United States for even more reachable defense
objectives.]{.underline} A report from the Center for American Progress
mentions the example of France's anti-terrorism operation in the Sahel,
where the U.S. ended up supporting basic air-refueling and surveillance
flights.36 A detailed study by the Clingendael Institute points out that
if the [EU]{.underline} **[wants]{.underline}** [to be a]{.underline}
**[credible actor]{.underline}** [in **crisis management**, primarily in
its neighborhood, then it should be able to operate crossspectrum in the
air, land, sea, **cyberspace**, and **space** domains --- which cannot
be done without **more serious investments** in European
defense]{.underline}.37 The [case of Afghanistan --- where Europeans
decided to leave after the U.S. withdrawal]{.underline} despite the
predictable consequences on migration and political instability [---
offers a concrete example of such shortcomings]{.underline}.38 As
Brookings expert Michael E. O'Hanlon points out, Afghanistan operations
did not require high-tech equipment or massive resources; but [the fact
that European countries involved in NATO operations in Afghanistan did
not step up to preserve a military presence in a crucial theater for
European security speaks to their unpreparedness in terms of stockpiles
of equipment and inability to conduct such operations without the help
of the United States]{.underline}.39 Germany's defense capabilities are
also emblematic: Despite having more fiscal leeway and being at the
forefront of European technological innovation, Berlin has not invested
in its military, which still lacks critical equipment such as body
armor, night vision gear, and helicopter spare parts.40 In this regard,
evidence suggests that [integrating and **strengthening European
defense** would undoubtedly offer more openings for specialization,
boost resource allocation and more broadly improve
readiness]{.underline}. Yet such opportunities are highly contingent on
building trust between allies and increasing political will, which will
inevitably take time and be achieved in different ways. Recently, some
inter-governmental initiatives outside of the EU and NATO frameworks
were taken to tackle these shortcomings. In 2018, French President
Emmanuel Macron launched the [European Intervention Initiative (E2I)
with the aim of deepening military cooperation between like-minded
European governments sharing a strategic culture]{.underline}. Through
intelligence sharing, scenario planning, joint planning and exercises,
its 13 participants are working to strengthen their military cooperation
so that they can offer rapid responses in case of a crisis. The E2I is
particularly relevant because one of its members is the United Kingdom,
which is not currently part of any PESCO projects. The U.K's involvement
signals the importance of the relationship and responsibilities that the
it shares with European partners on security. While limited, the
initiative [is an example of how Europe and the U.K. can strengthen
their security cooperation]{.underline}. As the U.K. has left the EU,
**[stronger defense cooperation]{.underline}** between the U.K. and the
EU [would]{.underline} also [**positively impact NATO** through
fostering]{.underline} **[synergies]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[interoperability]{.underline}**. However, [while relevant, these
initiatives are insufficient for Europe to play a credible role as a
security actor in its eastern and southern neighborhoods. And such
**weaknesses endanger** the deterrence power of the **NATO** alliance
against Russia and ultimately reduce the opportunities for the EU more
broadly to defend its security interests.]{.underline}

In the United States, several commentators point out that a more
integrated procurement system at the European level will negatively
impact U.S.-EU trade relations in the defense industry.72 Although some
economic losses for the United States are indeed possible, there are
ways to contain them and of course [an EU with a stronger defense would
make a more reliable partner for the United States]{.underline}. In
fact, [the **U.S. and EU** are currently discussing administrative
agreements]{.underline} with the EDA to allow the United States to
participate in PESCO projects. Through a franker dialogue[, the two
sides of the Atlantic **could strengthen the defense market without
resorting to protectionist stances on either side**]{.underline}. This
is particularly relevant [considering the strong ties between the U.S.
and EU defense industries**; they both could benefit from deeper
cooperation**]{.underline} and exchanges [on the technological level,
and from free and fair competition in the trans-Atlantic defense market
based on common rules and standards]{.underline}.

First, [the EU could be a valuable partner for the U.S. and NATO in this
theater]{.underline} given its growing economic and regulatory power,
especially related to fair-trade practices and human rights protection.
Second, NATO could help promote standards and interoperability (for
example, through procurement coordination between NATO and the EU as
described earlier). Increased interoperability not just through NATO but
also EU forces could help to quickly mobilize forces in case of
conflict, [**as well as serve as a deterrent regarding
China.**]{.underline} The EU could also offer support through its
European Peace Facility, designed to provide assistance to partner
countries to increase their security and defense capabilities.83
However, regardless of the type of assistance provided, without clear
rules for standardization and convergent strategies for procurement and
military strengthening, the two organizations (and their member states)
risk competing with one another for strategic and market advantages.

However, [the difference in how commitment to respective sets of values
is executed in NATO and EU results with a **wide portfolio of
cooperational problems**, ranging from bureaucratic to strategic,
**despite** their **intention to work together.**]{.underline} Could
there be comprehensive and mutually respectful cooperation between the
two organizations on security issues? Would this cooperation be
wearproof given the bilateral conflicts brought up by non-joint members,
such as in the Cyprus dilemma? This article surveys how [bilateral and
regional conflicts **challenge** the international **resolve for**
transatlantic **security cooperation**]{.underline}, in which NATO and
EU share common milito-political interest. The European Common Security
and Defense Policy: Boon or Bane The [Common Security and Defense Policy
(CSDP)]{.underline}, known before 2009's Lisbon Treaty as the European
Security and Defence Policy, [represented the **apex** of security
cooperation among European Union member states and]{.underline} the EU's
undertaking of a heavier defence role along with [NATO]{.underline}. The
CSDP seeks to exercise European military independence from NATO within
five areas: the self-assured security of the EU, a closer relationship
between eastern and western Europe, structural improvement in European
conflict management, cooperation between neighboring regions, and
pioneering global governance of conflicts. To implement these priorities
into pre-existing European structural mechanisms, the EU's
civilian-military status has undergone an updating process. For
instance, the European External Action Service (EEAS) was created
through the Lisbon Treaty, signed in 2007, which made the EU
constitutional laws legally binding and further centralized the Union.
The Lisbon Treaty also sought to address the independent methods in
which the EU member states were answering international crises. When
EEAS was launched in December 2010 as an EU department with the express
function of consolidating EU responses to international security issues
as an autonomous unit, it actualized CSDP's vision for a new European
crisis management strategy which technically compelled member states to
cooperate in situations of security threats, in or out of the EU.
Initiatives similar to EAAS make clear [what the EU lacks has **not**
been the **incentive** to incorporate an international security
dimension to its agenda, but the **technical practicality** to implement
decisions to that end in a unified manner]{.underline}. [**Although
common goals** had been set for NATO-EU cooperation through the Berlin
Plus Agreements]{.underline} in 2003 [before CSDP, creation of a unified
transatlantic defence and security policy between the two entities has
encountered **ample executive difficulties**]{.underline}. For instance,
[Cyprus -- an EU but not NATO member- was excluded from joint EU-NATO
meetings by Turkey -- a NATO but not EU member- due to the decades long
political antagonism over the Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus in
1974]{.underline}. [Even this]{.underline} **[seemingly
inconsequential]{.underline}** [bilateral problem was enough to
\[halt\]]{.underline}~~paralyze~~ the [NATO-EU cooperation]{.underline},
[making some organizational details]{.underline} of Berlin Plus
Agreement **[impossible]{.underline}**. Berlin Agreement's [decision to
create a merged NATO-EU headquarters in Brussels to manage conflicts in
which both the EU and NATO have common interests has **not helped**
reduce the fracture between American and European politics]{.underline}.
For instance, when France and Germany coordinated a joint gathering with
Belgium and Luxembourg to protest the British-American invasion of
Saddam Hussein's Iraq, NATO and then American government denounced it as
"Chocolate Summit," betraying the spirit of cooperation aimed by CSDP.
Joint NATO-EU missions for stabilization in Bosnia and Herzegovina in
2004, in Dafur, Sudan, as an assistance to African Union or in Somali to
combat piracy are, however, some successful products of Berlin Plus
Agreements. These joint undertakings are cases in which not all the EU
or NATO members were interested in intervention, but they were made
possible by sharing of military expertise and assets from either of the
parties, mostly by NATO. However, post-colonial Africa and Western
Balkans are regions over which NATO and EU do not have strong strategic
disagreements. [Despite Berlin Plus, EU has been **critical** of NATO's
call for joint missions in Afghanistan for instance and only supported
the civilian projects of current Resolute Support Mission of
NATO.]{.underline} Bilateral hurdles in front of NATO-EU cooperation
such as Cyprus Dispute are hence not the actual root causes hindering
the constructive attitude of Berlin Plus. As Europe's disapproval of
Iraqi invasion or reluctance of cooperation in Afghanistan demonstrates,
[the CSDP cannot overcome the]{.underline} **[strategic
divergence]{.underline}** [of NATO and EU in issues of incompatible
political interests]{.underline}. **[Ideological
divergence]{.underline}** of the two partners [should be reconciled
before]{.underline} the region specific problems are addressed by calls
for [joint military actions]{.underline}. The new and more
NATO-conscious level of ambition for CSDP thus required European member
states to invest more in security and defence, both politically and
economic. Perhaps an important undertaking was revisiting Berlin Plus
Agreement's comfort in EU utilizing NATO asset and capabilities when
necessary, instead initiating more EU-focused solutions like EAAS. [With
the attenuation of this cooperative ethos in both sides, there is a
present risk that NATO and the EU will begin to **compete** for limited
military resources]{.underline}, straying from the envisioned Berlin
Plus Agreement. [Lack of a coherent strategy among Western partners
could **prevent efficient response to crises**, which does not bode well
in a time of humanitarian atrocities]{.underline} --- whether it be in
Syria, Yemen, or South Sudan.

#### NATO-EU coop fails\-- unresolved Cyprus-Turkey conflict and opposing institutional goals leave all projects in a deadlock.

In spite of the promising start that created a solid framework for
cooperation, [by the early 2010s the EU-NATO relationship had produced
very limited tangible results and was mired in structural
obstacles]{.underline}. [The main impediments]{.underline}, especially
at the operational level, [were created by]{.underline} the standoff
between Cyprus and Turkey over [the unresolved conflict on
Cyprus.]{.underline} [Furthermore, there was a tendency on both sides to
see the relationship between NATO and the CSDP in terms of competition
--]{.underline} even as a zero-sum game -- which obviously did not
encourage cooperation.21 [Since its accession to the EU in 2004, Cyprus
has put brakes on Turkey's accession negotiations and blocked its
participation in EUled missions,]{.underline} membership of the EDA
[and]{.underline} generally [a more active role in CSDP.]{.underline}
[At the same time, Turkey has been able to block the use of NATO
capabilities and assets by the EU and has not allowed the participation
of the Republic of Cyprus, which it does not recognise, at formal
EU-NATO meetings.]{.underline} [Hence, meetings between the North
Atlantic Council and the PSC have been held rarely]{.underline} (the
latest took place in September 2015) [and with a narrow
agenda.]{.underline}22 [This deadlock practically turned the Berlin Plus
arrangements into a dead letter]{.underline} and 21. Drozdiak 2010. It
should also be said that the Americans were not at that point
particularly helpful. 22. In the 18 months to August 2015, four PSC-NAC
meetings were organised: one formal meeting on EUFOR Operation Althea,
two informal meetings on Ukraine, and one informal meeting on the
eastern and southern neighbourhoods. See Dakic 2015. prevented more
ambitious strategic cooperation. Berlin Plus arrangements have been used
only for two operations: Operation Concordia in the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), which ended in September 2003, and EUFOR
Operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina, an operation deployed since
2004. While formal cooperation was limited, in practice a division of
labour in crisis management took shape, roughly along the lines of
soft/civilian and hard/military security. [Although the CSDP was created
to carry out both civilian and military crisis management tasks, the EU
did not become the preferred instrument for more ambitious military
operations. Member states limited the use of CSDP to softer, non-combat
operations, whereas NATO took care of militarily more demanding
environments and combat tasks. This division was evident in the two
locations where both organisations had an operation running
simultaneously: Kosovo and Afghanistan]{.underline}. Staff-level
cooperation between the missions on the ground worked reasonably well,
thanks to individual efforts to find flexible and creative ways to work
around the formal obstacles.23 [It was also a setback to the CSDP that
EU Battlegroups were never deployed due to the lack of political will to
actually use this new tool. One of the hurdles was the reluctance of
member states to finance their deploymen]{.underline}t. As of today,
discussions on improved usability and more effective financing of the
Battlegroups continue, but the issue has been pushed down the list of
priorities by new, more promising areas of defence cooperation, to be
described below. [Apart from the structural hurdles, the EU side was
simply not very interested in close cooperation. The EU nurtured an
ambition to be a different kind of international actor, described as a
civilian, normative, ethical or soft power.24 This aspiration favoured
taking a step back from NATO, characterised by many as a relic of the
Cold War that was struggling to find a new purpose.25]{.underline}

The Biden administration also provides a window of opportunity to
progress and be ambitious in broadening and regularizing NATO-EU
cooperation in the field of innovation and EDTs. While political
dialogue among their leadership has been steadily increasing over the
past five years, the [EU and NATO have consulted on their respective
EDTs agendas only twice]{.underline}. Furthermore, **[bureaucratic
procedures]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[misalignments]{.underline}** sometimes [frustrate even staff-to-staff
cooperation in this area]{.underline}. The [EU and increasingly NATO are
proliferating agencies that conduct work on innovation in EDTs,
including in security and defense]{.underline}. [This makes it
**challenging** to achieve **internal coherence** of activities within
one organization, let alone **coordinating agendas** between the
two.]{.underline}

[You might argue that it can only be a good thing if the Europeans step
up their defence arrangements]{.underline}. But this has little to do
with increasing military muscle. **[It is not the answer]{.underline}**
to the plea by successive US presidents for the Europeans to do more on
defence. [NATO is well established, well proven and
credible.]{.underline} 27 of its 30 member countries are European,
including 21 that also happen to be EU countries. So [why create another
structure?]{.underline} [Any EU force would have to draw on the **same
limited military resources**]{.underline} [and would be a
**duplicative**, **divisive** **distraction**]{.underline}. [EU
ambitions already intrude into NATO where coordination structures
between the two organisations have now been set up]{.underline}, in
spite of the fact that their membership is largely the same. [The EU
wants to become the European leg of NATO -- so where would that leave
key non-EU European members of NATO such as the UK, Norway and
Turkey]{.underline}? In any case, **[the EU countries can't even agree
among themselves]{.underline}**. Many pay lip service to the idea of
CSDP while refusing to participate in any meaningful way. Even the
arch-federalist European Parliament, in its most recent report on EU
defence, noted that "in over 15 years of existence EU battlegroups have
never been used, in particular due to the lack of political consensus
among Member States and the complexity of implementation and funding..."
At NATO HQ in the early '90s, the French were already pushing for
European military capabilities separate from NATO. [When the Bosnian
crisis began they demanded that the matter should be discussed not at
NATO but 'in another place']{.underline} -- by which they meant the
Western European Union (WEU), [a purely European group whose
headquarters was just down the road in central Brussels. As a
consequence, nonsensically, two allied navies operated in the Adriatic
and Mediterranean, one under NATO command and the other under
WEU]{.underline}, with more or less the same ships rotating between the
two. Once the Bosnian military operations got more serious, even France
gave up on this farce and backed the NATO option.

Yet [NATO-EU cooperation remains]{.underline} somewhat
**[limited]{.underline}** [because of **political tensions** between
member states]{.underline} ([which hinders intelligence
sharing]{.underline}) [as well as]{.underline} **[weak]{.underline}**
[European]{.underline} **[military capabilities]{.underline}** [and
inadequate defense spending]{.underline}. Over the past few years the EU
has made important progress in this domain through the establishment of
the European Defense Fund and several defense projects under the
Permanent Structure Cooperation (PESCO) mechanism. Yet, [according to
several studies]{.underline} in the field, [the state of European
defense appears insufficient to tackle more serious military threats or
to enable the EU to take initiatives in its neighborhood
**independently** from the United States]{.underline}. In its "Strategic
Compass" to be published in March 2022, the EU is supposed to adopt a
bolder approach to its defense capabilities. In parallel, in a new
strategic concept to be released in June 2022, NATO is supposed to
tackle security throughout a widened angle, looking at domains that are
not strictly defense-related.

The European Union's Juncker 26 Commission (2014-2019) actively avoided
regulating AI, causing the European Parliament to increase their efforts
as a proactive voice in favor of stronger AI regulation. However, since
the beginning of Ursula von der Leyen's tenure, the Commission has
initiated efforts to adopt stronger regulation for AI applications
(i.e., differentiating regulation of AI based on defined "high-risk" and
"low-risk" sectors") and associated data spaces.27,28 These legislative
proposals and their associated discussions are planned to be completed
by the end of 2020. During the strategic planning and budgeting process
of its R&D programs, the EU committed to providing at least EUR10.7
billion29 for AI-related research conducted between 2021 and 2027.30
**[Despite]{.underline}** [these financial and political efforts, the EU
still]{.underline} **[remains technologically dependent]{.underline}**
[on the US and China and suffers from a **lack of capital and private
funding**, **decentralized and uncoordinated AI expertise**, severe
**brain drain** (including **to the US**), and **slow adoption** of AI
programming in its education and public sectors.]{.underline}

Before proceeding, [it is]{.underline} **[worth spelling
out]{.underline}** [the extent to which European security is
dependent]{.underline} on NATO and [in particular on the
US]{.underline}. Of the EU's 27 member states, 21 are members of NATO.
These countries account for about 93% of the population1 of the EU.
[Within NATO]{.underline}, those [Allies that are also EU members only
account for about **20%** of total defence expenditure across the
Alliance, while the US alone accounts for about **70%** of the same
total]{.underline}.2 Beyond these aggregate indicators, [it is
furthermore the case that the US is **considerably ahead** of the EU in
terms of practical adoption of AI]{.underline}. For illustration, [in
2020 US private-sector investment in AI was around \$23.6 billion, but
was only \$2 billion in the EU, implying a ratio of **12 to 1** in
favour of the US]{.underline} (Zhang et al. 2021, 96). Scientific output
indicators offer a more nuanced picture. [In]{.underline} 2019, the EU
accounted for 16.4% of the world's [peer-reviewed AI
publications]{.underline}, ahead of the US with 14.6%, while China
occupied the top spot with 22.4% (Zhang et al. 2021, 20). On the other
hand, if one measures research output [in terms of publications on the
Arxiv database, the US is ahead of the EU]{.underline} (Zhang et al.
2021, 33) [by a ratio of almost two to one]{.underline}, which is
[nonetheless much less than the large gap in private
investment]{.underline} mentioned above. That [the EU
performs]{.underline} similarly to the US in terms of scientific
research, but [far less well in terms of investment and
commercialisation of new digital technologies,]{.underline} is [an **old
problem** which has proven **very difficult to address**, whether at
national or EU level]{.underline} (Baroudy et al. 2020).

### No Cyber Solvency

#### The EU will seek commercial advantages on AI which undermines broader cooperation.

The [EU's effort to strengthen ethical AI, and]{.underline} to [make
'trustworthy AI' a unique selling point for Europe, might]{.underline}
also [end up **creating problems** for transatlantic
cooperation]{.underline}. Many [EU policymakers believe]{.underline}
that [the EU's insistence on ethical AI will]{.underline} eventually
[become a **location advantage** for Europe]{.underline} (much like data
privacy)[:]{.underline} [as more people become concerned about unethical
AI and data security, they will prefer to use or buy AI 'made in Europe'
rather than elsewhere]{.underline}. In this respect, [two European aims
are **at odds** with each other]{.underline}: [on]{.underline} the [one
hand, Europeans want to ensure that AI is developed and used in an
ethical way]{.underline}. Partnering with a powerful player such as the
US on this matter should be an obvious way to help them achieve this
goal. [However, if the EU considers ethical AI not just a goal for
humanity but a development that may also create **commercial
advantages** for Europe, then **transatlantic cooperation** on this
issue is **counterproductive**, as it would undermine Europe's
uniqueness.]{.underline}

[In addition to]{.underline} these [overarching EU initiatives, a number
of separate bi- and multi-lateral groupings and frameworks have also
emerged in the last 10 to 15 years, aiming to unite like-minded nations
in pursuit of greater defence integration.]{.underline} This trend
further [confirms that EU member states and partners recognise that,
individually, their defence capabilities are insufficient to
independently deliver most, if not all, defence missions and that
collaboration and harmonisation are necessary]{.underline}. [Under the
leadership of]{.underline} French President [Macron]{.underline}, for
example, [the European Intervention Initiative (EI2) was

### Agent CPs Bad

#### Agent CPs are a Voting Issue -- 

**a) Topic education -- agency debates are not grounded in the
resolution -- kills debate about military presence.**

**b) Aff ground -- moots the 1AC and makes it impossible to garner
offense -- they open the floodgates for an infinite number of
unpredictable counterplans**

**c) Read the CP as a DA -- solves their offense**

### International Fiat Bad

#### International Fiat is a voting issue --

**\--Not an opportunity cost -- the judge is the US -- logical decision
making is the portable impact of debate**

**\--CP justifies infinite intrinsicness because it expands the ambit of
the judge -- means we get to permute their DAs**

**\--Fairness -- impossible to research every possible actor -- kills
clash. And pressure CPs and international DAs solve their offense**
