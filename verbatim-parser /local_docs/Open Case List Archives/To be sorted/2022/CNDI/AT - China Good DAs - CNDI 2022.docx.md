### China Losing

#### China's authoritarian ascendence will cause its downfall -- the US will outcompete

[National-security analysts see China as one of the greatest threats
facing the United States]{.underline} and its allies. According to an
emerging conventional wisdom, [China has the leg up on the
U.S]{.underline}. in part [because its authoritarian government can
strategically plan for the long term, unencumbered by competing branches
of government, regular elections, and public opinion. Yet this faith in
autocratic ascendance and democratic decline is contrary to historical
fact]{.underline}. China may be able to put forth big, bold plans---the
kinds of projects that analysts think of as long term---but [the
visionary projects of autocrats don't usually pan out]{.underline}. Yes,
democratic governments are obligated to answer to their citizens on
regular intervals and are sensitive to public opinion---that's actually
democracies' greatest source of strength. Democratic leaders have a
harder time advancing big, bold agendas, but the upside of that
difficulty is that the plans that do make it through the system have
been carefully considered and enjoy domestic support. Historically
speaking, once a democracy comes up with a successful strategy, it
sticks with the plan, even through a succession of leadership.
Washington has arguably followed the same basic, three-step geopolitical
plan since 1945. First, [the [United States
built](https://www.amazon.com/Present-Creation-Years-State-Department/dp/0393304124)
the current, rules-based international system by providing security in
important geopolitical regions, constructing international institutions,
and promoting free markets and democratic politics within its sphere of
influence]{.underline}. Second, it welcomed into the club any country
that played by the rules, even former adversaries, like Germany and
Japan. And, third, the U.S. worked with its allies to defend the system
from those countries or groups that would challenge it, including
competitors such as Russia and China, rogue states such as Iran and
North Korea, and terrorist networks. [America can pursue long-term
strategy in part because it enjoys domestic political
stability]{.underline}. While new politicians seek to improve on their
predecessor's policies, [the United States is unlikely to see the
drastic shifts in strategy that come from the fall of one political
system and the rise of another]{.underline}. Democratic elections may be
messy, but they're not as messy as coups or civil wars. [Open
societies]{.underline} have many other advantages as well. They
[facilitate innovation, trust in financial markets, and economic
growth.]{.underline} Because [democracies tend to be more reliable
partners, they are typically skillful alliance builders, and they can
accumulate resources without frightening their neighbors.
They]{.underline} tend to [make thoughtful, informed decisions on
matters of war and peace, and to focus their security forces on external
enemies]{.underline}, not their own populations[. Autocratic systems
simply cannot match this impressive array of economic, diplomatic, and
military attributes]{.underline}. David Leonhardt [recently
wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/opinion/sunday/china-economy-trade.html)
in The New York Times, "Chinese leaders stretching back to Deng Xiaoping
have often thought in terms of decades." Commonly cited examples of that
long-term thinking include the Belt and Road Initiative, a program that
invests in infrastructure overseas; Made in China 2025, an effort to
subsidize China's giant tech companies to become world leaders in
21st-century technologies, such as artificial intelligence; and
Beijing's promise to be a global superpower by 2049. Since putting in
place sound economic reforms in the 1970s, China has seen its economy
expand at eye-popping rates, to become the world's second largest. Many
[economists
predict](https://www.newsweek.com/worlds-largest-economy-2030-will-be-china-followed-india-us-pushed-third-1286525)
that China could even surpass the United States within the decade, and
[some have
suggested](http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2043235,00.html)
that China's model of state-led capitalism will prove more successful,
in terms of economic growth, than the U.S. template of free markets and
open politics. I doubt these predictions. Because [autocratic leaders
are unconstrained and do not have to contend with a legislature or
courts, they have an easier time taking their countries in new and
radically different directions]{.underline}. Then, when the dictator
changes his mind, he can do it again. Mao's autocratic China ricocheted
from one failed policy to another: the Great Leap Forward, then the
Hundred Flowers Campaign, then the Cultural Revolution. Mao [aligned
with the Soviet Union in
1950](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/ziliao_665539/3602_665543/3604_665547/t18011.shtml)
only to nearly [fight a nuclear
war](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB49/index2.html) with Moscow
in the next decade. Beginning in the time of Deng Xiaoping, China
pursued a fairly constant strategy of liberalizing its economy at home
and ["hiding its capabilities and biding its
time"](https://www.ft.com/content/05cd86a6-b552-11e7-a398-73d59db9e399)
abroad. But President [Xi Jinping]{.underline} abandoned these dictums
when he took over. As the most powerful leader since Mao---he has
[changed China's constitution to set himself up as dictator for
life---he could once again jerk China in several new directions,
according to his whims]{.underline}, and back again. [According to the
Asia Society](https://aspi.gistapp.com/winter-2020/page/overview), he
has stalled or reversed course on eight of 10 categories of economic
reform promised by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) itself. Moreover,
Xi is baring China's teeth militarily, [taking contested
territory](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/world/asia/south-china-seas-photos.html)
from neighbors in the South China Sea and [conducting military
exercises](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/world/europe/china-russia-baltic-navy-exercises.html)
with Russia in Europe. The problem for Beijing is that [stalled reforms
will stymie its economic potential and its confrontational policies are
provoking an international coalition to contain them]{.underline}. The
[2017 U.S. National Security
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905-2.pdf)
declared great-power competition with China the foremost security threat
to the U.S.; the European Union labeled China a "systemic rival"; and
Japan, Australia, India, and the United States have formed a new "quad"
of powers to balance China in the Pacific. Furthermore, the plans often
cited as evidence of China's farsighted vision, the Belt and Road
Initiative and Made in China 2025, were announced by Xi only in 2013 and
2015, respectively. Both are way too recent to be celebrated as
brilliant examples of successful, long-term strategic planning. A
certain level of domestic political stability is a prerequisite for
charting a steady strategic course in foreign and domestic affairs. But
autocratic regimes are notoriously brittle. While institutionalized
political successions in democracies typically lead to changes of
policy, political successions in autocracies are likely to result in
regime collapse and war. China's "5,000 [years of
history](https://camphorpress.com/5000-years-of-history/)" were
pockmarked by rebellion, revolution, and new dynasties. Fearing internal
threats to domestic political stability---consider the [protests this
year in Hong Kong](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49317695)
and Xinjiang---[the CCP [spends more on domestic
security](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-spends-more-on-domestic-security-as-xis-powers-grow-1520358522)
than on its national defense. If you follow the money, the CCP is
demonstrating that the government is more afraid of its own people than
of the Pentagon]{.underline}. This [domestic fragility will frustrate
China's efforts to design and execute farsighted plans]{.underline}. If
threats to Chinese domestic stability were to materialize and the CCP
were to collapse tomorrow, for example, **[Chinese grand strategy could
undergo another seismic shift, including possibly opting out of
competition with the United States altogether]{.underline}**. [Shadi
Hamid: China Is Avoiding Blame by Trolling the
World](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/china-trolling-world-and-avoiding-blame/608332/)
Autocracies have other vulnerabilities as well. State-led planning has
never produced high rates of economic growth over the long term.
[Autocrats are poor alliance builders who fight with their supposed
allies more than with their enemies]{.underline}. And the highest
priority of autocratic security forces is repressing their own people,
not defending the country. The world has undergone drastic changes in
just the past few years, but these enduring patterns of international
affairs have not. Some fear that Trump's nationalist tendencies will
erode the U.S. position, but the momentum of America's successful grand
strategy has kept the country on a fairly steady course. Despite Trump's
criticism of NATO, for example, two new countries have joined the
alliance on his watch, including [North Macedonia this
week](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/02/world/europe/02reuters-nato-northmacedonia.html).
The coronavirus has upended a sense of security in the U.S., leading
many people into the familiar trap of [lauding autocratic China's firm
response](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/world/asia/coronavirus-china-united-states.html)
in contrast to the halting and patchwork measures in the United States.
But there is good reason to believe that this assessment will be updated
in America's favor with the benefit of hindsight. Already we are seeing
evidence that conditions are much worse in China than CCP officials are
letting on and that China's attempts at international "disaster
diplomacy" are backfiring. It has been revealed that the CCP has
continually
[misrepresented](https://time.com/5813628/china-coronavirus-statistics-wuhan/)
the numbers of COVID-19 infections and
[deaths](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/stacks-of-urns-in-wuhan-prompt-new-questions-of-virus-s-toll)
in China, and European nations have
[rejected](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52092395) and returned
faulty Chinese coronavirus testing kits. The great political theorist
Niccolò Machiavelli considered a similar line of thinking in the 16th
century, about whether republics or dictators charted a more stable
course. He wrote, "I, therefore, disagree with the common opinion that a
populace in power is unstable \[and\] changeable ... The prince ...
unchecked by laws, will be more ... unstable, and imprudent than a
populace." The U.S. political system certainly has problems. But
democracy is the best machine ever invented for generating enormous
power, wealth, and prestige on the international stage.

### China Econ Declining

**China's economy declining -- markets plummeting, rising risk of
recession, and GDP decline**

**He '22** {Laura He is a reporter and digital producer for CNN
Business, 5-5-2022, CNN, \"China\'s economy is going backwards \",
https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/05/economy/china-economy-services-decline-covid-intl-hnk/index.html\]//PJ

[China\'s gigantic **services sector just contracted at the second
sharpest pace**]{.underline} on record as Covid lockdowns hit businesses
hard. The Caixin purchasing managers\' index, a closely-watched
indicator for assessing the state of the economy, plummeted to 36.2 in
April from 42 in March, according to a survey released by IHS Markit on
Thursday. A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while anything above
that gauge shows expansion. [The services sector accounts for more than
half of the nation\'s GDP and over 40% of its employment. And with
survey data showing China\'s manufacturing sector also shrinking last
month, the **world\'s second biggest economy went backwards in
April**.]{.underline} While conditions might improve this month as Covid
infections rates ease and officials try to limit the damage to the
economy, [large parts of Beijing have just been placed under tighter
restrictions and some economists are now forecasting that Chinese GDP
will decline in the second quarter.]{.underline} The nation\'s capital
has effectively shut down its largest district, Chaoyang, suspending
transportation within it and encouraging 3.5 million residents to work
from home as part of its latest effort to curb Covid-19 cases, local
authorities announced Wednesday. The nearly 6-point decline in services
activity in April was second only to the collapse in February 2020, when
China\'s economy came to a near standstill as it battled to contain the
initial coronavirus outbreak that started from Wuhan. In that month,
[the Caixin services PMI dived to 26.5 from 51.8 in
January.]{.underline} Businesses in the world\'s second largest economy
were already grappling with rising energy and raw material costs, when
Covid lockdowns hamstrung their operations further. [It has also become
harder for firms to pass the higher prices to consumers, because of the
impact Covid restrictions have having on customer demand. That has
translated to even lower employment.]{.underline} \"Some companies,
affected by the drop in orders, laid off workers to lower costs,\" said
Wang Zhe, senior economist for Caixin Insight Group. The measure for
employment in the services sector has been under 50 for four consecutive
months, the survey showed. The data came just hours after China reported
a steep drop in tourist spending for the Labor Day national holiday.
Tourist spending was only 64.7 billion yuan (\$9.8 billion) over the
five-day holiday, down 43% from the same period last year, according to
a statement by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism late Wednesday.
People made 160 million domestic tourist trips during the holiday, down
30% from a year earlier. The data again highlights how China\'s
zero-Covid policy has taken a heavy toll on its economy. On Saturday,
PMI surveys from the government indicated that both factory and
non-manufacturing activities slumped in April to their worst levels
since February 2020. \"Recent mobility trends suggest that China\'s
growth momentum deteriorated significantly in April,\" analysts from
Fitch Ratings wrote on Tuesday. They expect GDP to contract in the
second quarter, before output recovers in the second half. [Nomura
analysts also warned last month of a **rising risk of \"recession\"** in
the second quarter, as lockdowns, a shrinking property sector, and
slowing exports hit the economy hard.]{.underline} As the highly
transmissible Omicron variant spreads quickly in China, the country is
battling its worst outbreak in more than two years. So far, at least 27
Chinese cities are under full or partial lockdown, which could be
impacting up to 185 million residents across the country, according to
CNN\'s latest calculation. That includes Shanghai --- the nation\'s
leading financial center and a major manufacturing and shipping hub. The
city has been under a lockdown since March 28. Although authorities
started to lift some restrictions last month, more than 8 million
residents are still banned from leaving their residential compounds. The
Chinese government still adheres to its stringent zero-Covid policy more
than two years after the initial outbreak --- at a time when the rest of
the world is learning to live with Covid. The policy involves mandatory
mass testing and strict lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus.
[But **economic costs are rising.** Many economists have **downgraded
their China GDP growth targets** for this year, citing risks from the
zero-Covid policy. Last month, the International Monetary Fund lowered
its China growth forecast to 4.4%, well below the government\'s official
target of about 5.5%.]{.underline}

[China's stubborn battle to eradicate Omicron is raising the risk of a
serious economic crisis.]{.underline} Nearly [one-third of the
population is under some sort of lockdown]{.underline}, with shops shut
and factories struggling. Policy easing looks unavoidable, but with
benchmark yields dropping below U.S. Treasury bonds, so does capital
flight. The outbreak in Shanghai, where asymptomatic cases are running
at around 25,000 a day despite two weeks of rigorous lockdown, is
prompting other regions to impose draconian measures pre-emptively. At
least 373 million people in cities contributing to 40% of China's GDP
have been affected, a Nomura survey showed. Key indicators are already
reflecting the shock. Domestic sales of passenger cars fell over 10% in
March, per official data; an index tracking freight traffic in China
dropped by about 25% during the first week of April. China contained the
initial outbreak in 2020 quickly and resumed production, allowing its
manufacturing sector to tap export markets to revive growth after a
single quarter of contraction. Omicron is far more infectious, yet
Beijing aims to reproduce that result. Officials appear to be realising
that won't be easy. [With the war in Ukraine pushing up commodities
costs, and demand for Chinese exports cooling as inflation spikes in key
overseas markets]{.underline}, premier Li Keqiang this week warned of
"**[unexpected changes" in the external and domestic environment that

stimulus and infrastructure spending will be hard to implement during

government bond issuance to ensuring stable energy supply. - Yields on

**China' economy in freefall -- mismanagement, COVID, and external
factors make it damage beyond repair**

**Singleton '22** \[Craig Singleton is a senior China fellow at the

What if the new era of great-power competition was over before it had
even begun? Many of today's fears about a multigeneration conflict with
Beijing rest on linear extrapolations of yesteryear's data, harkening
back to a time when China appeared on track to supplant the United
States as the world's largest economy. Yet more and [more signs point to
a **China that is fully unprepared for the competition** with the United
States]{.underline} it once sought. [**China's economy, long in decline,
is now in freefall**---thanks to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's
mismanagement]{.underline}. Case in point: This year, [the U.S. economy
is forecast to grow faster than China's for the first time since
1976]{.underline}, with strong indications that China has entered a
prolonged era of slow growth. More surprising is that Xi, [in an attempt
to stabilize China's finances, has largely abandoned his ambitious plans
to overhaul China's growth model, choosing instead to double down on the
very economic policies that got China into today's economic bind in the
first place.]{.underline} Put differently, Xi blinked. [Xi's reversal
speaks volumes. It suggests he lacks confidence in his own plan to
transform China's unsustainable economic model into one that can deliver
on the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) promise of "high quality" growth.
More important is that China's fizzling economic miracle may soon
undercut the CCP's ability to wage a sustained struggle for geostrategic
dominance.]{.underline} This raises a tantalizing question: What if,
instead of being a competitor, China cannot actually afford to compete
at all? Xi is often said to have tapped into Chinese resentment over its
colonial-era humiliations to kick-start its modern-day competition with
the United States. But the decision to jettison China's policy of hiding
its capabilities and biding its time began much earlier. Indeed, for
decades before Xi's ascent into power, CCP elites made clear this dictum
would be discarded as soon as the international balance of power shifted
in China's favor. When Washington looked to be terminally weakened by
the 2008 financial crisis, Chinese officials made their move, betting
that overseas investments and economic coercion were the keys to
outcompeting the West. They were mostly right. China's economic clout,
beyond any other consideration, still serves as the foundation for the
country's vast influence. The gravitational pull of China's market,
along with Beijing's ability to influence economic conditions and shape
political perceptions in other countries, enabled China to bind itself
to the world. The fruits of China's economic expansion also underwrote
its power projection, covering the costs of the Belt and Road
Initiative, military modernization, and expanding multilateral
commitments. China's GDP growth paid domestic dividends for the CCP too,
empowering a model of state capitalism that broke down the barriers
between the private sector and government institutions to mobilize the
former in service of the latter. Nevertheless, China's meteoric rise,
fueled by annual GDP growth above 6 percent, appears over. Yes,
[**China's economy has been cooling for years**, plagued by systematic
deficiencies like chronic overinvestment, massive debt loads, and a
shrinking workforce, which has put enormous stresses on China's
finances. But these **systematic trends have been exacerbated, perhaps
irreversibly**, by China's disastrous pandemic response, where the lack
of an effective domestic vaccine and the CCP's unwillingness to approve
and purchase Western ones have made rolling lockdowns a permanent way of
life. So far, the CCP's containment measures have resulted in plummeting
industrial output, surging unemployment, capital flight, and a sinking
currency. **Efforts to stabilize the Chinese economy will be further
strained by a deteriorating external environment**,]{.underline} with
the World Bank warning of 1970s-style [stagflation and reduced global
demand for Chinese exports]{.underline}---until now, the engine of
China's growth. [The economy remains severely dependent on vast supplies
of imported fuel, grain, and other commodities whose prices have
massively surged]{.underline}. Western technology transfer restrictions
are also taking their toll. Another challenge is growing frustration in
China's largest markets---the United States and the European
Union---over Xi's support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Already,
[large multinational companies like Apple are shifting supply chains to
Southeast Asia and other regions perceived as more stable]{.underline}
while expatriates are abandoning the country and newly minted college
graduates flee in droves. Indeed, **[China's brain drain has
begun.]{.underline}** So far, Xi has offered few new ideas for remedying
China's crisis, even as his subordinates warn about the need to "act
decisively" to avoid financial ruin. Xi's big bet consists of an
"all-out" infrastructure push to boost the economy---the same approach
that fueled China's current debt bubble, massive industrial
overcapacity, and the creation of entire ghost cities of half-finished
apartments. But such investments are unlikely to stimulate China's
economy, not least because they are focused on propping up the least
productive parts of China's economy, including the state sector. Making
matters worse, Xi has offered little relief for Chinese consumers, the
linchpin in his effort to drum up domestic consumption, decrease
inequality, and reduce the economy's reliance on exports and
unproductive investments. Consumers were integral to China's pandemic
rebound in 2021 but now face growing fears about job security and
sustained income losses from never-ending lockdowns. At the same time,
one by one, Xi's signature economic initiatives have disappeared from
the front pages of China's state-owned newspapers. That includes Xi's
push for "common prosperity," which ostensibly aimed to reduce extreme
inequality by giving ordinary Chinese a greater share of the nation's
wealth. Plans to introduce a property tax to slow down China's notorious
real estate bubble---where the elite have amassed vast fortunes---have
also been shelved. Chinese regulators have also signaled an end to Xi's
crackdown on China's tech giants, whose growing influence has long been
viewed as a growing threat to the CCP's power. Nevertheless, foreign
investors, who lost billions of dollars on Chinese tech stocks tanked by
Xi's policies, remain wary. With many Western banks warning that the
regulatory risks of investing in China now outweigh the potential
benefits, these investors may not come to Beijing's rescue either. Mere
months before Xi's coronation to a third term as party secretary, [CCP
officials whose jobs it is to worry about economic growth, like Chinese
Premier Li Keqiang, are now openly pitted against Xi]{.underline} and
those more concerned with regime security and party control, such as
Chinese Vice Premiers Han Zheng and Hu Chunhua. While Xi projects calm
and warns citizens not to question his zero-COVID policies, [Li refuses
to endorse them and instead speaks of China's "complicated and grave"
situation.]{.underline} This fractured policy environment, where
ideological and technocratic factions battle for influence, is **[eerily
reminiscent of late Chinese leader Mao Zedong's era]{.underline}**. Just
as it did then, today's intraparty clash will produce winners and
losers. For now, the latter group includes Xi, who will probably be
forced to make key personnel concessions during this fall's 20th
National Party Congress to secure the support needed to guarantee a
third term. For the remainder of 2022, China's worsening domestic
challenges will remain the party's highest priority, and addressing them
will take up an increasing share of China's economic resources. The
upshot is that U.S.-China tensions will likely remain subdued, at least
for the short-to-medium term. China's state-owned enterprises,
provincial and local governments, private companies, and citizens will
be forced to compete for a piece of a pie that is no longer growing.
More difficult to predict, however, is how China's fight for resources
and power will affect the country's various domestic stakeholders. For
the first time in a while, China's state-owned enterprises, provincial
and local governments, private companies, and citizens will be forced to
compete for a piece of a pie that is no longer growing. As a result,
funding trade-offs will be necessary, including those considered
inconceivable when China's annual growth hovers around 10 percent. That
will include cuts to current and planned investments in China's power
projection capabilities, both civilian and military. Outbound Chinese
development loans, a key tool for Beijing to expand relations across
Asia and Africa, have already dropped 96 percent in recent years, from
\$75 billion in 2016 to approximately \$4 billion during the pandemic.
The overall average value of Belt and Road Initiative-related projects,
averaging \$255 billion annually between 2010 and 2019, also cratered to
less than \$81 billion in 2020. Although these figures may recover
slightly, Chinese policymakers will be hard pressed to justify such
expenditures as China's economy falters. Similar trade-offs will also be
necessary for certain aspects of China's defense spending. In a
contested resource environment, [tensions will almost certainly emerge
between China's army, navy, and domestic security
apparatus]{.underline}. The same goes for civil-military relations
because local officials are often expected to provide the military with
the materiel and support required for training and large-scale
exercises. Overtime, [China's **economic slowdown could also lead to
civil unrest**, which could force the military to become more involved
in maintaining domestic security]{.underline} at the expense of its
broader modernization. Potential economic constraints could also impede
plans to fully fund newly announced ventures, such as China's space
force. Over the long term, China could be forced to choose among certain
core missions, such as monitoring China's coast, building up its South
China Sea outposts, maintaining its air defense identification zone, and
even protecting its unruly borders. Either way, China's military will be
forced to do more with less. In the end though, China's [sustained
economic cooldown]{.underline} and Xi's crisis of confidence [will
result in the very outcome he, the CCP, and Chinese nationalists feared
most: broad recognition that China may be incapable of competing with
the United States at all.]{.underline}

### China Hates NATO

#### China already hates NATO action

As leaders of major Western democracies and their allies met in two
back-to-back summits this week in Europe, their focus was clear: keeping
pressure on Russia as its brutal assault on Ukraine enters its fifth
month. [But another country was also pulled into the spotlight in those
meetings: China. And Beijing is not happy about it.]{.underline} For the
first time, China was included in NATO\'s \"Strategic Concept,\" adopted
at the bloc\'s summit in Madrid on Wednesday[. The document, last
updated in 2010, lays out the security challenges facing the alliance
while outlining a course of action, and now says China\'s ambitions and
\"coercive policies\" challenge the allies\' interests, security and
values. The new language has prompted China to accuse NATO of being a
\"Cold War remnant.\"]{.underline} \"[The Strategic Concept claims that
other countries pose challenges, but it is NATO that is creating
problems around the world,\"]{.underline} China\'s Mission to the EU
said in a statement Wednesday. [\"We urge NATO to stop provoking
confrontation by drawing ideological lines, abandon the Cold War
mentality and zero-sum game approach, and stop spreading disinformation
and provocative statements against China]{.underline}. Since NATO
positions China as a \"systemic challenge,\" we have to pay close
attention and respond in a coordinated way,\" it said. Earlier this
week, the Group of Seven (G7) major democratic economies included tough
language on China in their own communique, released days after launching
an infrastructure investment plan to counter China\'s Belt and Road
Initiative. European leaders have grown increasingly wary of China in
recent years and those views have hardened over the past few months as
Beijing has repeatedly refused to condemn the Russian invasion of
Ukraine and bolstered its ties with the Kremlin. \"We see a deepening
strategic partnership between Moscow and Beijing. And China\'s growing
assertiveness and its coercive policies have consequences for the
security of Allies and our partners,\" NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg said at a news conference Wednesday. \"China is not our
adversary. But we must be clear-eyed about the serious challenges it
represents,\" he said. Differences still exist between countries in the
bloc on how to treat China, observers say. Some NATO members want to
ensure the focus remains squarely on Russia, while the United States \--
by far the block\'s most powerful member \-- has pegged China as the
\"most serious long-term challenge to the international order.\" But the
developments this week, which show China to be higher on these bodies\'
agendas than ever before, signal an increasing alignment between the US
and its partners. They also mark a significant setback for Beijing,
which has tried to drive a wedge between the American and European
stances on China, observers say. \"The combination of the kind of
language used by the G7 and (China\'s formal inclusion) in NATO
strategic documents is indeed a blow for (China), and something that
they would have hoped and wished to be able to prevent,\" said Andrew
Small, a senior transatlantic fellow in the Asia Program at The German
Marshall Fund of the United States. \"It\'s an exceptionally strong
period in terms of transatlantic cooperation and that translates for
China in ways that they\'re very concerned about,\" he said. China\'s
concerns have been clear this week, as its Foreign Ministry pushed back
on the NATO designation in regular scheduled press briefings. \"China
pursues an independent foreign policy of peace. It does not interfere in
other countries\' internal affairs or export ideology, still less engage
in long-arm jurisdiction, economic coercion or unilateral sanctions. How
could China be labeled a \'systemic challenge\'?\" ministry spokesperson
Zhao Lijian said on Tuesday. \"[We solemnly urge NATO to immediately
stop spreading false and provocative statements against China,\" he
said, adding that NATO should \"stop seeking to disrupt Asia and the
whole world after it has disrupted Europe.\"]{.underline} But that
rhetoric \-- blaming NATO for \"disruption\" in Europe \-- is part of
what is driving a shift in European perspectives, analysts say, as
Beijing has refused to condemn Russia\'s actions in Ukraine, including
the killing of civilians, while actively blaming the US and NATO for
provoking Moscow. [China \"very quickly and very clearly lined itself up
\-- at least in words, not so much in deeds \-- with
Russia,\"]{.underline} while transatlantic partners came together
against Russia and in support of Ukraine in the wake of the invasion,
said Pepijn Bergsen, a research fellow in the Europe Program at the
Chatham House think tank in London. [The contrast between the two has
helped drive an emerging \"democracies versus autocracies\" narrative in
Europe, he said, adding that internal politics also play a
role.]{.underline} \"In Eastern and Central Europe, where Russia is
regarded as by far the number one security threat, relations (with
China) had already been starting to fray, but the fact that China so
clearly lined up with Russia has accelerated a shift,\" Bergsen said.
China, for its part, appears to have underestimated the extent to which
its stance would reverberate through its relationship with Europe, one
that was already on shaky ground following European concerns over
alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, erosion of freedoms in Hong
Kong and China\'s economic targeting of Lithuania over the Baltic
nation\'s relations with Taiwan. That miscalculation was on show in a
terse summit between China and European Union leaders in April, where
China focused on talking points around deepening their relations and
economic cooperation, while EU officials were bent on pushing China to
work with it toward brokering peace in Ukraine. China has claimed
neutrality and that it supports peace, but has made no concrete steps in
that direction. [Rising concerns about China from the G7 \-- made up of
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the US \--
were reflected in the bloc\'s joint communique, released Tuesday after a
summit in German Bavaria. The document, which mentioned China around a
dozen times \-- versus four references in the G7 leaders\' statement a
year earlier \-- touched on areas of cooperation, but focused on calling
on China to improve its human rights record and abide by international
rules.]{.underline} And in a mark of how Russia has shaped the bloc\'s
view on China, the group called on Beijing to \"press\" Moscow to comply
with United Nations resolutions and stop its military aggression. The
statement followed what Washington called the \"formal launch\" on
Sunday of a \$600 billion G7 infrastructure investment initiative, first
announced last year. The drive, which the EU said would \"demonstrate
the power of development finance when it reflects democratic values,\"
was an apparent bid to counter China\'s flagship Belt and Road
Initiative, which critics say Beijing has used to build its global
influence. [At NATO, the newly adopted strategy document says China
\"employs a broad range of political, economic and military tools to
increase its global footprint and project power, while remaining opaque
about its strategy, intentions and military build-up.\" It also points
to a \"deepening strategic partnership\" between Russia and China and
says their \"mutually reinforcing attempts\" to undercut the rules-based
international order \"run counter\" to NATO values. The language, which
also saw Russia move from a \"strategic partner\" in the 2010 document
to \"the most significant and direct threat\" in the current iteration,
is a clear bolstering of NATO\'s stance.]{.underline} That\'s
significant not least of all because in recent years, as NATO statements
began to reference China, some members and observers raised concerns
that taking too firm a stance risked turning China into an enemy. Others
have seen China as outside the region\'s key security interests.
Following a NATO meeting last June, in which leaders characterized China
as a security challenge, French President Emmanuel Macron downplayed the
move with a quip that \"China is not in the North Atlantic.\" Some of
those concerns still exist, and inside the bloc there remain differences
in views on how to handle China, observers say. Within Europe, such
debates even extend to the emerging \"autocracies versus democracies\"
narrative being promoted by the US, according to Pierre Haroche, a
research fellow in European security at the Institute for Strategic
Research (IRSEM, Paris). \"[Do you want to solidify the \'dragon-bear
monster\' to show that there is a clear ideological \'Cold War\' between
democracies and autocracies, because that\'s convenient in terms of the
narrative? Or is it (a better) strategy to say that the two (China and
Russia) are very different actors \... who might even, in the future,
oppose one another]{.underline}?\" said Haroche, summarizing the
argument. But even as differences may exist between member states, it\'s
clear that NATO is thinking bigger at this year\'s summit, with the
historic inclusion of leaders from New Zealand, Australia, South Korea,
and Japan. [The move was met with ire in China, where officials have
long argued that NATO was seeking to expand its presence into the
Indo-Pacific, which Beijing views as its own neighborhood.]{.underline}
\"The sewage of the Cold War cannot be allowed to flow into the Pacific
Ocean - this should be the general consensus in the Asia-Pacific
region,\" a Tuesday editorial from the Communist Party-affiliated
nationalist tabloid Global Times said. But observers have characterized
this not so much as an expansion of NATO into the Indo-Pacific, but
rather a bid to strengthen relations between, in the NATO secretariat\'s
words, \"like-minded countries.\" Those democracies across the Pacific,
like their counterparts in Europe, may now be seeing the threats they
face as more connected, according to The German Marshall Fund\'s Small.
\"There is much more of a sense emerging from all of this, conditioned
by the China challenge, by the Russia challenge, that the democratic
allies have to be more effectively coordinated,\" he said.

### China Hege Decline Now

#### China in decline -- US must maintain force and hege to contain aggressive and violent policies of China. 

**Brands '22** (Hal Brands. Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished Professor
of Global Affairs at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies (SAIS) and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \"The
Dangers of China\'s Decline as a Great Power\". April 14, 2022. Foreign
Policy. https://archive.ph/1Rt7v. 7-1-2022.)-cg

[Decline is a tricky concept]{.underline}. The term makes us think of a
country that is falling like a rock---one whose power and capabilities
are dropping across the board. [But a country can be in relative decline
vis-à-vis a fast-growing adversary even if its own power is still
increasing. It can be surging forward in some areas, such as military
might, even as its underlying economic strength starts to wither. And
decline doesn't always lead a country to scale back its objectives---the
sense of urgency it creates can cause ambitious powers to grab what they
can before the clock runs out.]{.underline} Xi Jinping's China is about
to give the world an education in the nuances of decline. [Since the
onset of its economic reforms in the 1970s, China has long defied
predictions that it would soon stumble or collapse. Its spectacular
growth challenged prevailing views about the sources of national success
in the modern world. In some ways, China is still soaring: Its military
power grows more formidable every year]{.underline}. When Xi declares
that "the East is rising and the West is declining," he gives voice to
this sense that China is a country on the make. [Yet military power is
often a lagging indicator of a country's trajectory: It takes time to
turn money into military muscle, and massive buildups often persist even
after a country's economic fortunes begin to flag. And today, for
reasons including demographic disaster and the lingering effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic, China is facing the end of the stunning economic
growth that made it possible for Xi to assert that the "great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation" was at hand. The China of the 2020s
will be a country whose coercive capabilities are more intimidating than
ever as its economic dynamism fades.]{.underline} That could be the
worst possible combination for the world. Any country that rises as
impressively as China is bound to make fools of some prophets of decline
along the way. In recent decades, Beijing has repeatedly confounded
those who predicted it was about to hit the wall. In the aftermath of
Mao Zedong's death, some Western observers were skeptical that China---a
country that U.S. diplomat George Kennan once called a "vast
poorhouse"---could put together the policies necessary for sustained
growth. After the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, it was common to
wonder whether the resulting political crackdown would stifle the
country's prosperity. Through the early 2000s, social scientists and
U.S. officials predicted that China could be rich or autocratic---but
not both. A few prominent analysts made careers for themselves by
heralding China's collapse. It hasn't happened---yet. From 1978 to the
onset of the global financial crisis three decades later, China's
constant-dollar GDP grew by a factor of 17, without the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) losing control. That growth enabled the
decades-long military buildup and sprawling economic influence that made
China a force to be feared on the global stage. As Tufts University's
Michael Beckley and I argue in our forthcoming book, Danger Zone: The
Coming Conflict With China, this economic miracle required good luck and
good policy. China seemed to have hit the demographic jackpot in the
1980s and 1990s; the unlikely combination of warfare and famine in the
1930s and 1940s, a regime-sponsored baby boom after the CCP took power,
and then the institution of the one-child policy in 1980 left the
country with a huge working-age population unencumbered by lots of young
or old dependents. China was nearly self-sufficient in food, water, and
other resources. And it had the fortuitous timing to start its reforms
as globalization went into overdrive, making it easier to integrate the
country into complex supply chains and thereby make China the workshop
of the world. Good policies were also crucial. Mao's one-man rule and
economic illiteracy had condemned China to serial, self-created
disasters. Once he died, Deng Xiaoping and his successors moved toward a
"socialist market economy." They opened China to trade and investment,
overhauled the tax and regulatory systems, shrank bloated state-owned
enterprises, and encouraged private business. Accompanying political
reforms limited the power of China's rulers and enlarged the space for
nonideological competence within the regime. The CCP relaxed its grip
enough to permit economic spontaneity---and reaped the benefits in the
form of prosperity that reinforced its political control. China's
ascendance shook the world intellectually as well as geopolitically: It
undermined post-Cold War Western beliefs that prosperity would lead
inevitably to political liberalization, that democracies produced higher
rates of growth than autocracies, and that tyranny was incompatible with
sound economic management. As China became a global heavyweight, a new
orthodoxy solidified---that a hegemonic transition was approaching as
Beijing surpassed the United States. One dissenter was the political
scientist David Shambaugh. In 2015, [Shambaugh argued that China was
suffering from a deep internal malaise and that Xi's increasingly
repressive rule was a sign of insecurity, not confidence. "\[F\]or all
the Western views of it as an unstoppable juggernaut," he wrote, China's
economy "is stuck in a series of systemic traps from which there is no
easy exit." Shambaugh struck a discordant note at a time when Beijing
was tightening its control of the South China Sea and spreading its
influence across multiple continents. He also happened to be right. Not
least of the oddities surrounding contemporary China is that much of the
world deemed its ascent inevitable just as its prospects started to
dim.]{.underline} This may sound absurd, given all the hype surrounding
China's rise. After all, that country is supposedly destined, as the
Harvard University political scientist Graham Allison (channeling
legendary Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew) has written, to
become "the biggest player in the history of the world." It's true that
China does boast many apparent advantages. It has an enormous domestic
market and is the leading trade partner of roughly 130 countries around
the world. It is making concerted investments in artificial intelligence
(AI), semiconductors, and other critical technologies. [If the United
States doesn't up its game, a national commission chaired by former
Google CEO Eric Schmidt warned in 2021, China could become the premier
"AI superpower." But look closer, and China's trajectory starts to seem
more tenuous.]{.underline} [For one thing, many of China's technological
achievements are narrower and less impressive than they first appear.
For example, Beijing has made great strides in AI applications focused
on surveillance (no surprise there), but the United States still leads
significantly across the wider expanse of AI subfields and uses. Despite
vast state subsidies, China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International
Corp. is years behind in the creation of cutting-edge semiconductors
that make up the foundation of advanced economies in the information
age.]{.underline} Just this year, Peking University published a candid
assessment---which the CCP then predictably censored---of China's
progress in science and technology. The verdict was that China is
"following \[the United States\] in most fields, running side by side in
a few, and leading in very few." And while China's other strengths are
not illusory, neither can they hide a reality that Beckley and I
discussed last year: The magic that made China's economic miracle is
unmistakably fizzling. The country's resource abundance is old news:
Overuse devastated much of China's arable land; industrialization and
pollution left the country with severe water scarcity. More damaging
still, China's abundance of human resources is also a thing of the past.
The one-child policy was a devil's bargain that is now causing
demographic implosion. China's total population is set to peak by 2028
(or perhaps as soon as this year, by some estimates) and then plummet by
as much as half by century's end. Its working population crested in
2015; it will fall by 70 million between 2020 and 2035 and even faster
after that. China will soon combine an enormous geriatric population
with a rapidly shrinking workforce. It will experience one of the worst
peacetime demographic crunches on record, a formula for stagnation at
best and catastrophic economic contraction at worst. [Making matters
worse, the era of enlightened economic policy is over. The reform agenda
has been stalled for more than a decade because further
liberalization---necessary to make the leap to a more innovative,
knowledge-based economy---would threaten the privileges of entrenched
elites.]{.underline} If anything, Xi has thrown the country into
reverse. [Politically, he is taking China into neototalitarianism
through pervasive repression and indoctrination. And economically, his
policies have a decidedly retrograde feel]{.underline}. Xi's agenda has
featured a preference for state-owned enterprises at the expense of the
more vibrant private sector; the imposition of severe, politically
motivated restrictions on wide swaths of the economy; attacks on the
autonomy of relatively technocratic institutions such as the central
bank; and the empowerment of political minders in companies of nearly
all sizes[. China's leaders may talk about the need to transition to a
high-tech, services-based economy, but Xi's policies are stifling the
competence, creativity, and spontaneity necessary to make that
shift]{.underline}. It all constitutes a "great leap backward"---a
reversion to pre-Deng-era policies that condemned China to stagnation.
There is also the question of what Xi's consolidation of power means for
the country's long-term resilience. [As the political theorist Francis
Fukuyama has written, for nearly 40 years after Mao's death China
avoided the "bad emperor" problem---the worst pathologies that accompany
authoritarian rule---by imposing term limits on its rulers and making
them more accountable to other CCP elites. Yet Xi has systematically
disassembled this system by purging rivals, sidelining potential
successors, and entrenching himself in power. By doing so, he is
enabling China to move faster and more decisively. But he is also
leaving the country vulnerable to impulsive or unwise
decision-making---a perpetual problem of one-man rule---and creating the
potential for terrible instability when his reign finally
ends.]{.underline} Xi's centralization of authority, while seemingly
impressive, is setting the country up for a fall. [Finally, it doesn't
help that a more assertive China is now facing more international
resistance]{.underline}. Trade barriers against Chinese companies and
products proliferated in the decade after the global financial crisis.
Washington has waged a technological cold war against Huawei, seeking to
deprive that Chinese firm of high-end semiconductors and keep it out of
the world's 5G networks. [Dozens of countries are more carefully
scrutinizing their economic, financial, and technological ties with
Beijing; the Japanese government is offering to pay companies to reduce
their China exposure. China is still central to the global economy, but
the days when the United States and other powerful countries eagerly
abetted its ascent are over. I]{.underline}ndeed, Xi's effort to
cultivate the domestic market is an implicit admission that China, which
rose on the strength of an export-focused economy, now confronts a very
different world. China's predicament has been thrown into relief,
ironically, by COVID-19. Early on, the pandemic seemed to herald an
epochal global shift. Prominent U.S. analysts saw it as a "Suez moment,"
the terminal crisis of the U.S. empire. Xi touted his regime's success
in containing COVID-19 at home (albeit after allowing it to escape to
the world) as an advertisement for Chinese authoritarianism. Two years
later, it's clear that COVID-19 was a turning point but not in the way
that Xi hoped. [The pandemic hypercharged global anti-China sentiment,
after Beijing concealed the initial outbreak and then exploited the
resulting chaos to bully nations from Australia to Germany and the
United Kingdom.]{.underline} [It thereby encouraged a host of
efforts---through multilateral institutions such as the Quadrilateral
Security Dialogue, AUKUS, and the G-7, as well as the United States'
bilateral alliances in the Pacific---to counter Chinese
power]{.underline}. "A Cold War mentality" had reemerged, a spokesperson
for China's foreign ministry complained, as the United States and its
friends pursued "anti-China encirclement." COVID-19 also confirmed how
patchy China's rise had been: [The country's biotechnology sector
couldn't produce anything like the revolutionary vaccines that
democratic innovation economies in the United States and Europe churned
out. Even China's heavy-handed success in containing COVID-19 at home
became a trap: The combination of "zero-COVID" policies, low levels of
natural immunity, and vaccines that proved weak or worthless against
highly contagious variants condemned the country to recurring lockdowns
of major cities, with all the accompanying disruptions.]{.underline}
Even before COVID-19, in fact, China's economic vital signs were
worrying. [The government claimed a growth rate of 6 percent, but
Chinese insiders and academic research indicate that the true number is
considerably lower---and even that growth is inflated by the relentless
injection of capital into a less and less efficient economy. As a
result, overall debt grew eightfold between 2008 and the end of 2020,
reaching 335 percent of GDP]{.underline}. In other countries, this
combination of slumping productivity and growing debt usually presages
sharp crises that turn into lasting economic quagmires. Xi's Chinese
dream involves catching up to the United States. In reality, his country
is slowing down. China is not, however, slowing down in all areas at
once. This isn't unusual: [The Soviet Union hit the apex of its military
power in the 1980s, when its economy was in a death spiral. In the early
20th century, Britain ruled a global empire at a time when its economic
supremacy had already slipped away. Today, China is stagnating
economically, but its drive for world power is
accelerating.]{.underline} Chinese leaders and propaganda organs now
openly tout the country's designs: In the coming decades, the official
state news agency Xinhua proclaimed, China will "re-ascend to the top of
the world." Beijing is creating new international organizations and
co-opting others. Its marquee projects, namely the Belt and Road
Initiative and the Digital Silk Road, aim to project economic and
political influence across Eurasia and beyond. China also fashions
itself as an ideological role model for other countries: Its style of
governance, Xi has said, offers a "new option for other countries and
nations that want to speed up their development while preserving their
independence." Most notably, China is building and wielding the tools of
geopolitical coercion. Countries such as Australia, Lithuania, Norway,
and South Korea have felt China's economic bite after they opposed its
policies or criticized its internal practices. Chinese military
spending---having already grown tenfold in real terms between 1990 and
2016---continues to rise, funding a dramatic expansion of the
capabilities needed to conquer Taiwan, overawe Beijing's neighbors, and
perhaps even take on the United States in the Western Pacific. The
statistics are simply astounding: Beijing put as many ships to sea from
2014 to 2018 as were in the navies of Britain, Germany, India, Spain,
and Taiwan combined. [And having long avoided a nuclear arms race with
Washington, Beijing is now sprinting forward and could be the United
States' nuclear peer by the 2030s. Threats to use force against enemies
have also become ubiquitous: Anyone who obstructs China's plans, Xi
warned in 2021, will "have their heads bashed bloody against the Great
Wall of Steel."]{.underline} It is sometimes hard to believe that such a
country is running out of gas. But perhaps China's strategic urgency is
increasing because its economic outlook has turned grim. [China's "hide
and bide" strategy---the approach it followed for a generation under
Deng and after---was one of patient confidence. If time was on a rising
Beijing's side, then it made sense to gradually build the country's
power and delay confrontation with the United States. Today, China's
strategic mindset is darker and more insistent.]{.underline} In many
areas, Xi acknowledges, "the West is strong, and the East is weak."
[China must race to make itself "invincible" so that "nobody can beat us
or choke us to death." What the United States will face in this decade,
then, is a China whose ability to batter its enemies and challenge the
global order is growing, even as leaner economic times loom ahead. This
China is unlikely to be benign or peaceful]{.underline}. History has
seen many once ascendant countries lash out violently rather than accept
a disappointing future as a second-tier power. [This fear is what led
Germany to take the risks that helped ignite World War I. It prompted
Japan to undertake the expansionist rampage that helped bring on World
War II. Xi has grand ambitions, from capturing Taiwan to establishing
China's primacy in Asia and, eventually, the world. If he loses faith
that the patient accumulation of economic power will bring Beijing these
rewards, he may become more inclined to take risks and use China's
coercive tools to secure them instead]{.underline}. This means that the
task of dealing with China could prove quite ticklish in the years
ahead. [The United States can't simply rest easy, confident that a
peaking China will fade away. Instead, it will have to rapidly firm up
its defenses in places where an impatient Beijing might lunge for
advantage, such as the Western Pacific. The United States and its allies
will have to join forces to prevent China from weaponizing its still
considerable economic and technological leverage to fracture the
anti-Beijing coalitions now taking shape. And they will have to ensure,
through multilateral control measures as well as investments in their
own capabilities, that the democratic world maintains its edge in
semiconductors and other critical technologies that will shape the
future balance of economic and military power]{.underline}. Yet
Washington and its friends will also have to do all this while keeping
channels of communication open and not unnecessarily provoking an
anxious China that may lash out as its predicament worsens. After all,
power and pessimism can make a deadly mix. The hardest sort of China to
handle may be one that is strong and weak at the same time.

[Rivals for centuries, China and Russia now have a partnership that has
"no limits,"]{.underline} Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin said
in early February. The [energy, military and political ties nurtured
over the past decade between the world's two most powerful authoritarian
states --- both of which aim to upend at least parts of the
US-dominated, post-Cold War order --- have aroused growing concern among
democratic leaders from Washington to Tokyo]{.underline}. Just weeks
after the joint statement, when Russia invaded Ukraine, China refused to
condemn the move. Still, the support Beijing has shown its ally since
has been anything but boundless. [The rapprochement was driven by a
common alienation from America that deepened after the 2003 US-led
invasion of Iraq and became increasingly overt after the 2008 financial
crisis, which originated in the US. Both states concluded that the
meltdown would undercut faith globally in the US economic and political
model. They increased ties cautiously until 2014, when Russia's
annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula triggered sanctions and a
definitive break between Russia and the wider West. That forced Moscow
to look for new partners and especially new markets for its energy
exports. China was a good fit, proving a massive and fast-growing buyer
of Russian commodities and weapons. The two states also share a deep
hostility toward US alliances in what they consider their own rightful
spheres of influence.]{.underline} For Russia, that's the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization in Europe; for China, it's Washington's network of
bilateral defense treaties in the Indo-Pacific region. Though short of a
formal, treaty-based alliance, the partnership between China and Russia
has been enhanced by a strong personal bond between Putin and Xi.
Products of tough childhoods, both men have evinced a determination to
crush dissent at home and restore their nations to greatness, ending
their perceived humiliation by the US and Europe. They have met more
than 30 times, making dumplings together in Tianjin and pancakes in
Vladivostok. In 2019, Xi called Putin his "best friend." In a joint
statement in February, they spelled out their shared contempt for
Western ideas of democracy. They defined democracy without reference to
elections, independent courts or free media and said it was about
economic development, with all models for public political participation
equally valid. In the 1800s, Russia was among European powers that
imposed so-called unequal treaties on China's Qing dynasty, including
one ceding the territory where the Russian city Vladivostok sits today.
Relations improved dramatically for a short period after Mao Zedong led
China's Communist Party to power in 1949, finding a natural ally in
Josef Stalin. But Mao opposed the political reforms known as
de-Stalinization that followed the Soviet leader's 1953 death and, in
1961, he split from Moscow. In 1969, the two countries fought a brief
border war over disputed territories and, in 1972, China did the
unthinkable by turning toward the US. It wasn't until the mid-1980s,
when Mikhail Gorbachev took charge in the Kremlin, that relations began
to thaw again. [Since 2014, Russia has sold China some of its most
advanced weapons systems, including \$5 billion worth of S-400
anti-aircraft missile systems and SU-35 attack jets]{.underline}. Within
two months of Crimea's annexation, Russia's Gazprom PJSC signed a deal
it said was worth about \$400 billion to supply China with natural gas
through a pipeline called the Power of Siberia. A second pipeline deal
has been struck since. [In addition, the two countries have increasingly
coordinated their positions at the United Nations Security Council,
where both wield vetoes. The growing cooperation between China and
Russia has led some policy makers in the US to fear that the country
could be forced to fight wars on two fronts, for example if Russia were
to threaten an American ally in Europe to distract the US during a
confrontation with China over Taiwan.]{.underline} US Senator Jim Inhofe
argued last year that, adjusted for purchasing power parity, the two
nations combined spend more on defense than the US. [There's a wider
concern that the combination of economic, military and political muscle
the two can muster is emboldening other world leaders with autocratic
tendencies, undermining confidence in democracy as a political system,
and threatening the version of the rules-based international order
promoted by the US and its allies since the end of the Cold War. China
avoided criticizing the invasion, blamed the US and NATO for the
conflict, and bought Russian oil that was being shunned by some other
countries, indirectly funding Moscow's war machine. But Xi proved
reluctant to unequivocally back the war or help Russia cushion the
financial impact of US and European Union sanctions.]{.underline} With a
gross domestic product almost eight times the size of Russia's, China
has substantially more at stake in a global economy that's still
dominated by the US and other developed democracies.

#### Chinese Russian relations have been great since 2014 -- invasion of Crimea and decline of the west

Director of the Transatlantic Security Program, Center for New American

https://www.csis.org/analysis/best-and-bosom-friends-why-china-russia-ties-will-deepen-after-russias-war-ukraine)ZK

Previous [Russian aggression in Ukraine has been a catalyst]{.underline}
for deepening Russia-China relations. [Russia's illegal annexation of
Crimea in 2014 significantly accelerated the]{.underline} slow [warming
of the relationship that started in the waning days of the Cold
War]{.underline}. Convinced that it had no real economic opportunities
in the West, [the Kremlin turned to China for help in offsetting Western
pressure.]{.underline} At that time, China's initial support for Moscow
was tepid. Beijing was vaguely critical of the West for supposedly
causing the crisis, and it never verbally supported
[Russia]{.underline}n annexation, abstained on key UN resolutions, and
[allowed Chinese firms to abide by U.S. and European
sanctions.]{.underline} China also took advantage of Russia's increased
economic dependence to drive a hard bargain on key energy deals. Yet
[Beijing]{.underline} eventually [leaned into its partnership with
Russia]{.underline}. While Moscow's need to diversify away from the West
energized relations, [Beijing]{.underline} also [came around to
recognize the utility in building a stronger relationship with the
Kremlin]{.underline}. In particular, the China-Russia partnership
crystallized around a fundamentally similar view of the United States as
a primary strategic threat. Both Xi and Putin view U.S. support for
democracies in their regions---and for those fighting repression and
authoritarianism inside China and Russia---as an effort to extend
influence and ultimately overthrow their regimes. The leaders also view
the U.S. alliance network---including the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the Quad grouping in the Indo-Pacific---as a
direct challenge to their security and to their regimes. In the wake of
2014, these views hardened, especially as both countries' relations with
the United States grew more adversarial. Moreover, [Xi and
Putin]{.underline} have noted the increasing challenges facing Western
democracies and [have grown more confident that the United States and
the West are in decline]{.underline}. They therefore view the time as
ripe to challenge the U.S.-dominated global order and alliance network
and hasten Washington's retrenchment from their respective peripheries.
Both also expect the United States to do everything in its power to hold
onto its superpower status, particularly in the face of China's rise,
including coercing its allies to take actions against their own
interests. [Russia and China's deepening alignment since
2014]{.underline}, along with the complementarity of their needs and
capabilities, [has fueled growing ties across **all dimensions** of
their partnership.]{.underline} In the economic sphere, for example,
China's share of Russia's [external trade doubled from 10 to 20 percent
between 2013 and 2021]{.underline}. Their partnership deepened **[most
notably in the defense domain]{.underline}** and in their [common
crusade against democracy and the universality of human
rights.]{.underline} Arms sales and technical cooperation have grown, as
have the frequency, scope, and complexity of their joint military
exercises. In the democracy domain, Moscow and Beijing together are
popularizing authoritarian governance, exporting their best practices,
watering down human rights norms, backing each other up in multilateral
forums, creating norms around cyber and internet sovereignty, and
bolstering illiberal leaders. Despite these developments since 2014,
China is once again treading carefully in the aftermath of Russia's
reinvasion of Ukraine. China has abstained from voting on key UN
resolutions, and Chinese firms are tentative about maintaining
operations with Russia, given their desire to avoid secondary sanctions.
The key difference, reflecting the much deeper starting point of their
relationship going into this crisis, has been China's far stronger
rhetorical support for Russia. Senior Chinese officials not only
indicated support for the Kremlin's "reasonable security concerns" about
potential NATO expansion as a justification for its initial actions but
have since doubled down on pledges to deepen ties with Russia, parroting
Russian talking points about its actions in Ukraine and the culpability
of the United States and NATO for the conflict's endurance. [To signal
their enduring close partnership, Russia and China flew joint patrols
near Japanese and South Korean air defense zones in **May
2022**]{.underline} during President Joe Biden's trip to Asia designed
to rally America's U.S. Indo-Pacific allies.

account for nearly half of the estimated \$15.7 trillion that AI will
add to the global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030, and almost
double the expected growth in North America.23 AI's economic benefits
are undeniable, but AI competition with China goes beyond GDP growth and

### Russia Alliance Turn

#### The more Russia loses (the aff), the more China will support them. Worst case, everything is balanced. 

**Blanchette 22** (Jude Blanchette holds the Freeman chair in China
studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, "The
worse things go for Putin in Ukraine, the more China will back him," The
Washington Post, March 24, 2022 at 4:09 p.m. EDT,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/24/xi-jinping-putin-china-russia-sanctions/>) -
MP

China has tried to have it both ways since Russia invaded Ukraine a
month ago. It abstained from key votes at the United Nations criticizing
Russia's actions, avoided directly labeling President Vladimir Putin's
assault on Ukraine an "invasion," amplified Russian disinformation and
repeatedly laid blame for the war at the feet of the United States and
NATO. At the same time, Beijing has also largely complied with sanctions
against Russia, made repeated, if vague, calls for a negotiated
settlement to the hostilities and provided humanitarian assistance to
Ukraine. But make no mistake: [The worse it goes for Russia in Ukraine,
the more China will step up its support for the Putin regime. Beijing's
uneven diplomatic strategy may seem to stem from a desire to achieve
multiple, often conflicting aims, most notably to forestall a
deterioration in relations with Europe.]{.underline} Not all objectives
are weighted equally, however, and as the war enters a more protracted
and destructive phase, [China's primary goal is coming into focus: to
ensure that Russia retains its status as Beijing's key strategic
partner, even if this necessitates paying serious economic and
diplomatic costs. Beijing will see the prospect of a Russian defeat as a
direct threat to its own territorial security and ability to compete
head-to-head in the geopolitical rivalry with the United
States]{.underline} --- and China simply can't allow that to happen. To
see why Beijing has a direct stake in the war's outcome, it's critical
to understand how its relationship with Russia has evolved since the
collapse of the Soviet Union, and how China views the global security
environment evolving over the next three to five years. Since the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, China and Russia
have experienced significant friction and mutual mistrust. The nadir of
the relationship came in 1969, when the two communist powers nearly
engaged in a nuclear war. Since 1989, however, Beijing and Moscow have
systematically addressed the major points of contention in their
relationship, including any lingering territorial disputes. In 2001, the
countries signed the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly
Cooperation, and after Chinese leader Xi Jinping assumed power in 2013,
cooperation has expanded to include joint military exercises, efforts to
reform global governance and technology sharing[. For example, the two
countries continue to develop a satellite navigation system to rival the
United States' GPS, and in January, Russia and China, along with Iran,
held a series of naval drills in the Indian Ocean]{.underline}. This
growing symbiosis was formalized on Feb. 4 in a joint statement issued
during Putin's visit to Beijing at the start of the Winter Olympics
(Xi's meeting with Putin then was his first with a world leader since
February 2020, when he appeared with the Mongolian prime minister in
Beijing). Stretching more than 5,000 words, the joint statement
encapsulated a shared worldview between two authoritarian powers and two
autocratic leaders. The global order is undergoing "momentous changes,"
the statement read, which include a "transformation of the global
governance architecture and world order" and "global challenges and
threats growing from day to day." But perhaps more important, the joint
statement articulated a shared grievance that the United States and its
allies threaten Chinese and Russian interests and global aspirations.
NATO, the document states, promotes an "ideologized cold war approach,"
while the U.S. "Indo-Pacific strategy" endangers the "peace and
stability in the region." [Before Russia had even invaded Ukraine, then,
Beijing had come to see Moscow as a critical security and strategic
partner in the growing power rivalry with the United States and its
allies in Europe and Asia]{.underline}. More to the point, Russia is
China's only real military and strategic partner. Although tensions
exist in the bilateral relationship, not least because of the growing
economic gap between their economies, the broader geopolitical
chessboard draws Moscow and Beijing together. What's more, [Putin and Xi
have a close relationship --- they've met in person or virtually nearly
40 times in the decade that Xi has been in power. Time is running out
for China The war in Ukraine has undoubtedly thrown Beijing off balance,
and Chinese officials certainly didn't want Putin to invade in the first
place, but the basic math underlying this strategic partnership with
Moscow has not changed]{.underline}. Indeed, the war has only
consolidated Beijing's central logic for supporting Russia, given the
recent demonstration of Western diplomatic unity, the overwhelming power
of U.S.-led sanctions and the reinvigoration of NATO. The former editor
of the Chinese nationalist Global Times newspaper, Hu Xijin, argued in
recent commentary that ["if the U.S. pursues extreme strategic coercion
against China, with Russia as a partner, China will not fear a U.S.
energy blockade, our food supplies will be more secure, as will \[our
supplies\] of many other raw materials]{.underline}." In a speech last
weekend, China's vice foreign minister Le Yucheng drew a straight line
between NATO in Europe and China's own security concerns, warning that
just as Moscow's actions in Ukraine were a direct consequence of NATO
expansion, any actions by NATO in the Asia-Pacific region would provoke
similar consequences, and thus, the "crisis in Ukraine is a stern
warning." Beyond the substantive reasons underlying China's support for
Russia, there is also Beijing's unwillingness to be seen as submitting
to the U.S. demand that it back away from Moscow. As one Chinese Russia
expert at the Shanghai International Studies University observed, "If
China goes along with the U.S. against Russia, it will not only greatly
strengthen the anti-Russian camp, but will also be a huge boost to the
U.S. 'leadership.' " The key question now is just how far Beijing will
go to support Moscow. While Xi would like to maintain good relations
with Europe and avoid a further deterioration in the U.S.-China
relationship, [the fate of Putin and the Russian state directly
implicates China's core security interests.]{.underline} Not only would
the prospect of a beaten and broken Russia activate China's fears of
instability along their shared 2,500-mile border, but it would also
create uncertainty about the future leadership and geopolitical
orientation of the Russian government. If Putin were eventually to fall
from power, would his successor remain aligned with Beijing? So the more
anxious Beijing becomes about the war and Putin's personal position in
power, the more likely it is to step up support by providing direct
economic assistance, mitigating the impact of sanctions and even
supplying military equipment. Clearly, China's preference is to avoid
secondary sanctions in response to any support --- access to the
international market and the U.S. dollar remains critical for China's
economy and its continued rise. [But Beijing could pursue means of
support that are difficult to track, such as facilitating Russia's
access to U.S. dollars via offshore accounts, or by directing
state-owned enterprises and even private companies to increase their
purchases of non-sanctioned Russian goods and services]{.underline}. If
[China]{.underline} does decide to supply Russia with military
assistance, it [would likely seek to avoid equipment and hardware that
would flagrantly violate international law and sanctions or be easily
traceable, and instead provide spare parts, ammunition or certain
dual-use items that aren't yet sanctioned]{.underline}. But critically,
the decision to provide aid to Russia would be driven primarily by
Beijing's assessment of how Russia is faring in the war, rather than a
desire to avoid paying economic or diplomatic costs. Unfortunately, it
is difficult to imagine that Beijing is watching the conflict unfold
without growing more nervous by the day: Russia has failed to achieve
any of its major military or political objectives. In just the past
week, the Russian military has escalated its offensive to include a
wider number of indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets, and
President Biden is also now warning of "clear signs" that Putin is
considering using chemical weapons. Domestically, Putin has begun to
purge his inner circle, arresting some within the security services and
senior officials in the national guard. Beijing will see this as a sign
that Putin's grip is weakening, and as the sanctions continue to
decimate Russia's economy, anxiety in China is only likely to grow.
Succession plans protect nations. Putin and Xi just threw theirs out.
[Some analysts suggest that China may well see Russia's recent weakening
in the wake of sanctions as a net positive, as it shifts the balance of
power in the relationship in Beijing's favor]{.underline}. A tangible
benefit of such a shift would be Beijing's ability to demand more
favorable terms in buying Russian energy. While it's true that Beijing
leveraged Moscow's economic and diplomatic isolation after Russia
annexed Crimea in 2014 to gain better terms in several large energy
deals, the security environment for China in 2022 is far more
contentious than it was in 2014, and Moscow's true value is its
ideological orientation and military capabilities as much as its energy
stores. Xi does not want a weak Russia for a security and strategic
partner. If Beijing turns toward and not away from Moscow as the war
grinds on and the extent of human suffering increases, the basic
trajectory of [China's relations with the West will undergo a profound
shift toward open rivalry]{.underline}. It would be comforting to think
that [the prospect of such a disastrous turn would be enough to dissuade
the Chinese leadership from traveling down this path]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, though, [Beijing's geopolitical outlook for the next
decade]{.underline} --- much like Washington's --- [includes conflict
and friction as defining features.]{.underline}

## Growth Impact Answers

### Growth Resilient

#### Chinese growth is resilient -- reforms ensure that small dips won't stick

**Liu 16** -- (Chinese ambassador to the UK, "The Chinese economy is
still full of power", 2/27/16,
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/12175115/The-Chinese-economy-is-still-full-of-power.html)//EO

A glass is filled halfway with water. Pessimists would say it's half
empty, while optimists would say it's half full. The same is true when
it comes to the Chinese economy. Quite a few [pessimists]{.underline}
have been forecasting doom and gloom since the beginning of the year.
However, they have [fail]{.underline}ed [to see the country's resilience
and the new driving forces that have emerged. In fact, [the recent
moderation in China's growth is the anticipated result of reform
measures and
regulation](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/02/26/ftse-100-extends-gains-and-china-rebounds-as-finance-ministers-g/).
This is therefore the "new normal"]{.underline}: we are seeing slower
yet better quality growth helped along by proactive and deeper reforms.
Of course, [China's growth rate could easily have exceeded 7 per cent if
the energy- and- pollution-intensive industries had been given free
rein,]{.underline} or if massive stimulus measures had been applied.
[China, however, chose not to opt for this kind of unsustainable growth
-- because it would come with a huge cost and would sacrifice the
long-term development of China and the world]{.underline}. Instead,
China has chosen to focus on the following five key areas: addressing
excess capacity, downsizing property inventories, expanding effective
supply, helping enterprises reduce cost and guarding against financial
risks. This approach, like losing weight, won't be without its
discomforts or pain. But just as perseverance will see one through a
diet -- to less fat, stronger muscles and a healthier body -- so it is
with the Chinese economy. [Despite the moderation in growth, the
fundamentals of the Chinese economy remain strong. While the stock and
foreign exchange markets have their own patterns, the key is to look at
the bigger picture. It is true that the 6.9 per cent growth in 2015 was
the lowest for China in 25 years. But this was achieved by an economy
that is 10 trillion dollars in size.]{.underline} The actual increment
is equivalent to the yearly GDP of a medium-sized country and it is
larger than the amount generated by double-digit growth years ago. In
other words, [against the background of the sluggish world economy,
China remains one of the fastest-growing major economies -- and it
contributes over one quarter of global growth]{.underline}. Consumption
now accounts for two thirds of China's growth and the service sector now
makes up more than half of GDP. [China's solid material foundation,
abundant human resources and vast market potential will continue to
provide a sound basis and condition for sustained economic
growth]{.underline}. The gap between the eastern and western regions,
and between the urban and rural areas, indicates ample spaces and
untapped potentials for further development. Moreover, the ongoing
process of new industrialisation, IT application, urbanisation and
agricultural modernisation is generating strong driving forces for
growth. China's fiscal deficit and government debt is also secure and
much lower than that of the US, Europe and Japan, leaving enough room
for further positive regulation. Going forward, five new engines will
drive forward China's economy. The first engine is the 13th Five Year
Plan. With its five key development concepts -- innovation, balanced
growth, a green economy, opening up and inclusive development -- this
Plan will map out the way for China to get over the "middle-income trap"
and join the high-income economies. The second engine is supply-side
reform. Rather than being a copy of Reaganomics or Thatcherism[, China's
supply-side reform is a response to the economic "new normal" in China.
Its core mechanism is to replace ineffective and low-end supply with
effective and high-end supply, which will increase
competitiveness.]{.underline} The third engine is open development.
[China will continue to improve its domestic business environment in
terms of legal, international and business-friendly
practices.]{.underline} The fourth engine is China's active involvement
in global economic governance and in providing public goods. The Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank, officially inaugurated last month, is
just one example of this. The fifth engine is innovation-driven
development. [China will optimise the allocation of key resources in
order to stimulate innovation, to create new demands and new supply, and
to give rise to new businesses.]{.underline} Since the financial crisis,
China has made an outstanding contribution to global growth. [It is
widely recognised as the world's economic powerhouse and has fulfilled
its responsibility as a key global player. Make no mistake: that engine
is still full of power and will continue to bring opportunities and
benefits to the world.]{.underline} "Although Zhou was an ancient state,
it had a reform mission." This line from a 3000-year-old Chinese work,
the Classic of Poetry, best portrays the country's commitment to reform.
Today, reform and innovation remain the source of confidence and
strength for China. [There is every reason to look to a world-embracing
China for steady progress and for a promising economic
future.]{.underline}

Indeed, most workshop participants argued that [[if China were beset by
an]{.mark} acute [internal crisis, the]{.mark} Communist [Party
would]{.mark} almost certainly **[refocus its energy and resources
inward]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The leadership]{.mark} and its security
apparatus, including components of the military, [would have their hands
full protecting against social instability]{.mark}]{.underline}, tamping
down the activities of Uighur and Tibetan separatists, and maintaining
the cohesiveness of the party itself. [[To launch a foreign war in an
atmosphere of domestic public grievance would be **particularly
dangerous** ]{.mark}**for Beijing.**]{.underline} [[If China sustained a
defeat]{.mark} at the hands of the Japanese or U.S. navy, [the
leadership would compound its reputation for economic
mismanagement]{.mark} with one for military ineptitude---a potentially
lethal cocktail for the ruling party.]{.underline}

### AT: CCP Collapse

#### Growth or decline doesn't matter \-\-- it's how the regime [frames]{.underline} the issue, which proves it's resilient

**Zeng, 16** -- PhD in Politics and IR, Associate Fellow at the Centre

As mentioned in the Introduction chapter, **[[there is no empirical
evidence to prove that the CCP's legitimacy solely relies on economic
success]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Arguably, [there are two major problems
in the relevant literature: the exclusion of ideological factors and the
narrow focus of government performance]{.underline}. [[The major problem
with the socioeconomic]{.mark} performance [approach lies in its
exclusion of ideological factors, **which leads to many problematic
arguments and predictions**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [The performance
legitimacy approach implies a problematic relationship between economy
and politics]{.underline} (White, 1986). [[The argument -- **that
legitimacy of the CCP**]{.mark} **primarily [relies on economic
performance]{.mark}**]{.underline} [-- [implies that economic
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} [or the slowdown of economic growth would
[lead to some kinds of legitimacy]{.mark} crises or major disasters in
China.]{.underline} This is also explicitly warned by many who argue
that economic deterioration will unavoidably lead to political crisis
(Krugman, 2013; Zhao, 2009). This kind of argument implies that economic
factors are the independent or dominant variables, while political
factors are subordinate or dependent variables. [[It is flawed to
contend that the regime is helpless in an economic
crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline} This book endorses White's assertion (1986)
on the primacy of politics -- that proper political actions can fill the
deficit in legitimacy created by economic difficulties. As mentioned in
the Introduction chapter, **[[legitimacy]{.mark} directly [comes from
neither economic crisis nor economic growth]{.mark}]{.underline}** per
se (Gilley and Holbig, 2010). [[Ideological factors will transform
economic performance into people's subjective perceptions]{.mark} of
economic performance, and [regime legitimacy is based on "those
perception]{.mark}s" rather than on economic performance]{.underline}
per se. As such, **[[an economic crisis is not a direct threat to a
regime]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [its impacts on political legitimacy
depend on people's perceptions of the crisis and the regime; thus, how
the government frames this crisis is crucial]{.underline} (Gilley and
Holbig, 2010). In other words, [[how political actors use ideological
factors to frame]{.mark} people's [perceptions of the crisis]{.mark}
(i.e., discourse) [is key to deciding the impact of the crisis on
legitimacy.]{.mark}]{.underline} Proper political actions and effective
crisis management will contribute to minimize legitimacy loss or even
sometimes enhance legitimacy. As discussed below, [[there is much room
to manipulate people's dependency]{.mark} on the government and on its
irreplaceable role during a crisi]{.underline}s. This is especially true
in China, where people's dependency on the government is more obvious
because of historical traditions (Tong, 2011). [The CCP has abundant
experience and the capability to market its authoritarian rule through
information control and powerful propaganda campaigns]{.underline}. In
the 2008 financial crisis, for example, the Chinese government actually
won, rather than lost, legitimacy credits. [[The regime strategically
manipulated this crisis as an opportunity to achieve its political
purposes]{.underline}]{.mark} including the promotion of Scientific
Outlook of Development (Holbig, 2011). [The Chinese media highlighted
China's good performance in coping with the financial crisis
domestically in contrast with the disaster that this crisis caused in
other countries]{.underline}, and the official media also made efforts
to project international recognition onto China's crisis management. By
[using those propaganda strategies, [the CCP]{.mark} successfully
[transformed its performance during this crisis into positive
perceptions, **thus legitimacy**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Holbig, 2011).

#### No internal link \-\-- the economy is not directly reflected in legitimacy \-\-- ideology outweighs

**Zeng, 16** -- PhD in Politics and IR, Associate Fellow at the Centre
for the Study of Globalisation and Regionalisation at the University of
Warwick, and Lecturer in Politics and IR at Royal Holloway, University
of London \[Jinghan, "The Chinese Communist Party's Capacity to Rule,"
Oct 29, 2015 Palgrave Macmillan *Critical Studies of the Asia-Pacific*,
Academia\]

[Economic performance is the most frequently mentioned element of
performance legitimacy]{.underline}. The conventional wisdom of Western
scholar- ship holds that economic achievement is a principal (if not the
sole) pillar of legitimacy in contemporary China (Krugman, 2013;
Laliberté and Lanteigne, 2008b; Perry, 2008; Shambaugh, 2001; Wang,
2005a; Wang, 2005b; Zhao, 2009; Yang and Zhao, 2014). In a major
textbook on Chinese politics, Tony Saich (2004: 347) argues that
"\[CCP\] legitimacy is currently based on the capacity to deliver the
economic goods." Economic performance is absolutely important. However,
[**[empirical studies]{.underline}** [show that while economic
performance matters]{.underline}, **[there is no strong
evidence]{.underline}** [to prove that it is the
sole]{.underline}]{.mark}[, let alone the principal, [pillar of
legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline} (Chu, 2013; Lewis-Beck, et al., 2013;
Munro, et al., 2013; Yang and Tang, 2013). In addition[, if economic
prosperity leads to high levels of popular support for the government,
why do not other coun- tries that enjoy economic prosperity -- such as
India and Brazil -- also have high levels of support, as China
does]{.underline} (Tang, et al., 2013)? Based on [[a 2010 national
survey]{.underline}]{.mark} in China, Dickson (2013) [[finds a negative
rela- tionship between economic development and popular
support.]{.mark}]{.underline} In addition to economic performance,
[[social stability is another essen- tial element of government
performance]{.mark}, and it has also been widely accepted as a
fundamental pillar of the CCP's legitimacy]{.underline} (Breslin, 2009;
Dickson, 2011; Laliberté and Lanteigne, 2008b; Shue, 2004; Sandby-
Thomas, 2011). Shue (2004), for example, argues that [[the CCP "stakes"
its legitimacy on its ability to maintain social
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}. Needless to say, social stability and
economic growth are interdependent. Without a stable social order, the
economy cannot grow rapidly; conversely the welfare materials delivered
by economic growth might help to enhance social stability. [This
interdependence suggests that the rules of modern states are based on
different combinations of legitimacy sources rather than on any one
pillar]{.underline}. Legitimacy by nature has many dimensions, and its
sources are often interrelated. [[Ideology]{.mark} in particular [plays
a crucial role in influ- encing other sources of
legitimacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Arguably, [a fatal weakness of the
performance legitimacy approach is its insufficient attention to ideo-
logical factors]{.underline}. As mentioned, **[[the mainstream approach
overempha- sizes economic growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and many
assume that market reform has also rendered ideology obsolete. [This
misguided view has **underestimated the role of ideology**]{.mark} in
contemporary China]{.underline}. Legitimacy generated from government
performance is not directly through government performance per se but
from citizens' subjective perceptions of this performance. Ideological
factors play a crucial role in shaping those perceptions. Thus,
**[[economic performance -- crisis or growth -- is not directly
reflected in legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Gilley and Holbig,
2010); [[the performance will be framed by ideological factors]{.mark}
and transformed by conductive ways [into people's subjective perceptions
of economic performance]{.mark}. If economic performance became the sole
legitimacy pillar in China, then economic deterioration would
unavoidably lead to political crisis. However, [the financial
crisis]{.mark} of 2008 [enhanced rather than weakened the CCP's
rule]{.mark}]{.underline} (Holbig, 2011). [By using the Chinese media to
highlight the good performance in coping with the financial crisis
domestically and the disaster this crisis caused in other countries, the
CCP managed to manipulate this debacle as an opportunity to gain
legitimacy and achieve its political purposes]{.underline} -- such as
marketing its then-official ideology, the "Scientific Outlook of
Development" (Holbig, 2011).

\*Author Initials added for Clarity

JJM: [My argument]{.underline}, in a nutshell, [is that [if China
continues to grow economically]{.mark} over the next 30
years,]{.underline} much the way it has over the past 30 years, [that
[it will **translate that wealth into military might**.]{.mark} And [it
will try to **dominate Asia**]{.mark}, the way the United States
dominates the Western Hemisphere.]{.underline} And my argument is that
[this makes good strategic sense for China. Of course[, the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates will not allow that to happen if it can.
And the United States will, therefore, form a balancing coalition in
Asia, which will include most of China's neighbors and the United
States. And they [will work overtime to]{.mark} try to [contain China
and prevent it from dominating Asia. This will lead to a **very intense
security competition** between the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and
[China's neighbors]{.mark} on one hand, [and China]{.mark} on the other
hand. And **[there will be]{.mark} an ever-present danger of
[war.]{.mark}**]{.underline} PN: Of course [[from this]{.mark}
observation [rises the imperative if not to strangle China's
economy]{.mark} then [to]{.mark} certainly [slow it
down]{.mark}]{.underline}. JJM: There's no question that preventive war
makes no sense at all, [but a much more attractive strategy would be to
do whatever we could to slow down China's economic growth]{.underline}.
Because [[if it doesn't grow economically, it can't turn that wealth
into military might and become a potential hegemon]{.mark} in
Asia]{.underline}. I mean, [what really makes China so scary today is
the fact that it has so many people and it's also becoming an incredibly
wealthy country.]{.underline} Our great fear is that China will turn
into a giant Hong Kong. And [[if it has a per capita GNP]{.mark} that's
anywhere [near Hong Kong's]{.mark} GNP, [it will be **one formidable
military power**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So the question is, Can you
prevent it from becoming a giant Hong Kong?

### Growth Bad -- Japan 

#### Chinese economic decline prevents Sino-Japan war and cements US leadership

Similarly, [[China's economic slowdown could offer Japan an occasion to
gain leverage]{.mark} in the Sino-Japanese relationship, [creating the
possibility to tamp down tensions]{.mark} in the East China Sea [and
stabilize bilateral ties]{.mark}]{.underline} that remain a fragile, but
critically important, component of the regional security landscape.
Perhaps most significantly, [[a Chinese economic slowdown affords
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[an opportunity to buttress]{.mark} its political, economic, and
military [position in the Asia-Pacific, and assuage worries that
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [lacks sufficient strategic
vision]{.mark}]{.underline} and political commitment to the region. The
outcome relies on how Washington plays its hand, but [[the result could
be the strengthening of a rules-based, U.S.-led security
architecture]{.mark} in the Asia-Pacific region for years to
come]{.underline}.

#### A Chinese-Japan war is only an incident away and goes nuclear

While your Twitter and Facebook feed these days might be filled with
stories about Iran, North Korea and ISIS, as well as the South China
Sea, 2016 could be the year of a deadly clash between China and
Japan---and the stakes could not be any higher for the United States. A
recent article in Foreign Policy sets the stage for such a clash---and
shows how America could get sucked in. After a relatively peaceful
year---if such a thing exists in the East China Sea---[[Beijing and
Tokyo are]{.mark} once again [warning each other]{.mark} to back off
claims [over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands]{.mark}]{.underline}. With the
rhetoric heading up, Foreign Policy reporters Dan De Luce and Keith
Johnson headed over to the Rand Corporation for a war game that pitted
China vs. Japan and eventually the United States. In the simulation,
Tokyo's treaty ally pledged to defend the island nation, including the
disputed islands, from attack. The scenario for the wargame was
frighteningly realistic to say the least: ["[A group of]{.mark} renegade
[Japanese ultranationalists wade ashore]{.mark} on [a barren
islet]{.mark} they call Uotsuri-shima]{.underline}. It's the largest of
a cluster of uninhabited and uninhabitable rocks known as the Senkakus,
or the Diaoyu in Chinese, the unlikely locus of a long-running
territorial dispute between Tokyo and Beijing. [[The activists plant the
Japanese flag]{.mark}, declaring that the islands are inalienable
Japanese territory;]{.underline} their YouTube video threatens the
Chinese navy with destruction if it dares to seize the islands. "Caught
off guard, Tokyo is slow to respond, but eventually disowns the
ultranationalists and their stunt. By then, though, [[China]{.mark} has
[condemned the move as a hostile act and]{.mark} has [dispatched]{.mark}
armed [coast guard]{.mark} and [naval vessels]{.mark} to the relatively
shallow waters around the Senkakus.]{.underline} Chinese marines arrest
the 14 activists and vow to bring them back to China for prosecution.
"The next day, [[the Japan Maritime]{.mark}
[S]{.mark}]{.underline}elf-[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}efense
[[F]{.underline}]{.mark}orce [[is dispatched]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
area, [[accompanied by]{.mark} a squadron of [Japanese F-15
fighters]{.mark}]{.underline}. China maintains its naval ships around
the islands and insists that it will not withdraw from the area. As the
two militaries appear headed on a collision course, [Tokyo informs
Washington that it is finally invoking the mutual defense treaty the two
nations have had since 1951. Now the White House has a decision to
make."]{.underline} While it is well worth your time to read all the
twists and turns, here is the ultimate of spoilers: "The United States
sends humanitarian aid and disaster-response teams to Japan to bolster
its homeland defense and dispatches the carrier at a safe distance in
flight range of the Senkakus. It also launches targeted, precision
strikes on a handful of Chinese missile sites on the coast, clearly
explaining to Chinese leadership the limited nature of the measures."
And **[[into hell we descend]{.underline}]{.mark}**: "U[.S. [missiles
rain down on the Chinese homeland]{.mark}]{.underline}; Japanese
commercial freighters explode on the high seas; [China's shiny new navy
is quickly shrinking under relentless undersea attacks.]{.underline} In
reprisal[, [Chinese forces obliterate Kadena]{.mark}]{.underline} Air
Base on Okinawa and take a potshot with a carrier-killer missile at the
George Washington, damaging it and forcing it out of the area. The
casualty toll is appalling on all sides, with thousands dead." Feel a
sense of déjà vu, National Interest readers? It seems good minds think
alike, as I explored a very similar scenario back in June of 2014:
"Picture it: It\'s March 1, 2015. Tokyo and Beijing are headed towards
what was once the unthinkable. "Over the last several months China has
instituted daily non-naval maritime patrols around the hotly disputed
Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Beijing is even sending fully-fledged naval
assets within the islands\' 12 mile exclusion zone while its aircraft
carrier, the Liaoning, exercised only 50 miles away from the islands
back in February --- truly the end of Beijing\'s small-stick diplomatic
strategy. "But on 1 March the plot thickens. Two Chinese SU-27 fighters
come within 25 feet of a Japanese P-3 Orion surveillance plane just 10
miles west of the Senkakus (sound familiar?). The Japanese pilot gets
nervous. A slight tweak at the controls and the Japanese plane collides
with one of the Chinese fighters. Both aircraft crash into the ocean,
with no survivors. \"Naturally each side blames the other. Beijing
accuses the Japanese pilots of violating Chinese sovereign airspace and
violating its Air Defense Identification Zone, or ADIZ. Japan claims the
Chinese pilots acted recklessly, flying so close. The media in both
countries fan the flames of nationalism. Just 72 hours later, a group of
twenty Chinese nationals land on one of the disputed islands under the
cover of darkness. Rumors swirl that Beijing knew of the voyage but did
nothing to stop it. A Japanese naval task force carrying a small
detachment of soldiers is dispatched. Their goal: remove the only
residents of the disputed five-island chain. "Beijing threatens force if
its citizens are harmed. As Japanese naval forces come within 20 miles
of the islands a Chinese J-10 fighter jet buzzes the task force. On its
second pass it comes dangerously close to a Japanese destroyer. In a
perceived act of self-defense, the destroyer shoots down the aircraft.
"Hours later, as Japanese forces begin operations to remove the Chinese
nationals from the Senkakus, Beijing fires a warning shot, a DF-21D or
"carrier-killer" missile which hits the ocean just 10 miles away from
the Japanese task force. Undeterred, Japanese forces press ahead.
Domestic pressure on Chinese leaders becomes intense. They feel they
have no choice but to escalate, launching a massive saturation strike
with ballistic and cruise missiles against the Japanese task force.
Three vessels are hit with heavy loss of life. Global media coverage of
the burning hulks and bodies in the water reaches a fever pitch. Prime
Minister Abe urgently phones President Obama formally requesting
America\'s help under the terms of the US-Japan alliance --- a 3am call
no president would ever wish to receive. War in Asia seems imminent." So
what to make of all this crazy block quoting? Simple: a [[conflict in
Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}---which would make problems like ISIS seem
like mere child\'s play---**[[is only an incident
away]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And make no mistake about it, [such a
conflict, [considering]{.mark} that [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and China are armed with nuclear
weapons]{.mark}, would be a frightening affair]{.underline}. Food for
thought as we contemplate other pressing national security
challenges---for if [Asia was ever to be engulfed in the flames of great
power war [only bad things would result, with millions of lives in the
balance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Growth Bad -- BioD

#### Chinese growth causes massive species extinction in China---extinction

**Nagle 9** \[John Copeland, prof at Notre Dame Law School, "The
Effectiveness of Biodiversity Law," Spring, 24 J. Land Use & Envtl. Law
203\]

China offers the best and the worst of biodiversity protection.
[China]{.underline} is a vast, varied nation that [hosts an incredible
range of ecosystems and species. \"[China\'s biodiversity ranks eighth
in the world]{.mark} and first in the northern hemisphere.\" n67 Over
100,000 species of animals and nearly 33,000 plant species
exist]{.underline} in 460 different types of ecosystems. Those
ecosystems include forests, grasslands, deserts, wetlands, seas and
coastal areas, and agricultural ecosystems. China hosts 212 different
types of bamboo forests alone. [[China also has]{.mark} an unusual
number of [ancient]{.mark} and relic [species because of its protection
from historic geologic events]{.mark} such as the movement of
glaciers]{.underline}. Most famously, it is the only home of the giant
panda, the symbol of many efforts to protect biodiversity throughout the
world today. Such species and ecosystem diversity is complemented by an
unsurpassed collection of genetic diversity. \"[The [richness]{.mark} of
China\'s cultivated plants and domestic animals [are
incomparable]{.mark} in the world. [Not only did many plants and animals
on which human survival depend originate in China, but it also retains
large numbers of]{.mark} their wild prototypes and
[relatives]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} n68 A 2005 report estimated that
China\'s biodiversity is valued at nearly five hundred billion dollars.
n69 China is also the home for more than 1.25 billion people. The
[[rapid economic growth]{.mark} that China has experienced]{.underline}
since 1980 [[strains the]{.mark} nation\'s [ability to preserve
ecosystems]{.mark}, species, and genetic resources]{.underline}. But the
biodiversity of China has encountered countless threats for thousands of
years, including the cultivation of more and more land for agriculture
and the consequences of numerous wars. During the Great Leap Forward of
1958 to 1960, \[\*216\] Mao Zedong targeted the \"Four Pests\": rats,
sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes. The attack on sparrows enlisted
schoolchildren to knock down nests and to beat gongs so that the
sparrows could not find a place to rest. Only after sparrows were
virtually eliminated throughout China did the country\'s leaders
recognize the value of the birds in controlling insects. [China faces
many of the same threats as biodiversity]{.underline} in other
countries, [with the notable addition of the country\'s notorious air
pollution. Habitat loss is the biggest threat to biodiversity in
China]{.underline}. As in many other countries, [rapid economic
[development and]{.mark} continued [population growth exert relentless
pressure]{.mark} on previously undeveloped areas that offered habitat to
a diversity of wildlife and plants]{.underline}. The overgrazing of
rangelands, erosion, and the adverse effects of tourism and mining
further compromise the condition of ecosystems and species throughout
China.

## Hege Impact Answers

The Final Report released by the US National Security Commission on
Artificial Intelligence in 2021 describes China as a "competitor," if
not a leader, to the United States in terms of AI development. A basic
understanding of the US-China AI competition is established in the
report: ". . . we must win the AI competition that is intensifying
strategic competition with China. [China's plans, resources, and
progress should concern all Americans.]{.underline} It is an AI peer in
many areas and an AI leader in some applications. We take seriously
China's ambition to surpass the United States as the world's AI leader
within a decade."5 The report also foresees [China's determination to
surpass the United States in AI leadership with its talent and
technological development.]{.underline} This section demonstrates the
area of China's AI development and applications. Before digging into the
military aspects, the reason China has been devoted into AI should be
explained. In 2015, China issued the document Made in China 2025 and two
years later in 2017, China released the New Generation Artificial
Intelligence Development Plan. These two documents proved that China's
central government officially confirmed the importance of developing AI
technologies. The primary purpose of China's AI development is for
domestic use. First, advanced technologies are the major driving force
for the economic and commercial development in China. To maintain its
rapid growth, China encourages high technologies research and
development, including AI, thus many private firms and research
institutions have entered this field. Second, AI has been adopted
domestically to improve the overall well-being, for example, payment
using facial recognition, online AI-driven medical diagnosis, and
security cameras that are designed to enhance safety. [China\'s
determination]{.underline} of developing [AI technologies
is]{.underline} not [supported]{.underline} only [by]{.underline}
documents but also [practice.]{.underline} The Ministry of National
Defense has established research institutions---the Artificial
Intelligence Research Centre and the Unmanned Systems Research
Centre---to focus on AI and unmanned systems research and development.
The key military think tank, the Academy of Military Science (AMS), has
also updated its doctrine to cope with the AI technological development:
"The [revamped AMS is tasked with driving defense innovation and
ensuring that the]{.underline} People's Liberation Army's
([PLA]{.underline}) warfighting theory [and doctrine fully capitalize on
disruptive technologies]{.underline} like AI and autonomous systems."6
In addition to the government-backed official organizations, a number of
private institutions have also invested considerable sums of money to
conduct related research. The central government of China uses the term
"intelligentized" warfare to refer to the innovations in military
technologies.7 Ryan Fedasiuk, Jennifer Melot, and Ben Murphy analyzed
more than 300 AI-related equipment contracts of the PLA regarding the
adoption of AI technologies, and the result of their research shows that
around 2 percent of PLA contracts are related to AI in the half year
from April to November 2020. [The research also predicted that China
would continue to invest in AI technologies and may create
vulnerabilities for the United States.]{.underline} Moreover, to quickly
transfer technologies from the private sector to the public, [China also
launched a national strat]{.underline}egy, [the military-civil
fusion]{.underline}, [to create a favorable research]{.underline} and
development environment.8 Among all the AI technologies, China places
the top priority on unmanned combat systems and equipment along with
other advanced military innovations.9 Unmanned technology has been
profoundly [changing the face of warfare, and unmanned equipment is one
of the first options for future combat equipment]{.underline}. Since
President Xi Jinping took office, he has emphasized the importance of
unmanned systems on various occasions. For example, in 2017, when Xi
Jinping visited the training of unmanned operations, he said to the
sergeant that "UAVs are important combat forces for the modern
battlefield. You must carry out your duties well and cultivate good
personnel."10 Another example was in 2020, when Xi met students at the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force Aviation University, he
declared, "Drones are profoundly changing war scenarios. It is necessary
to strengthen drone combat research, education and training, and
accelerate the training of drone pilots and commanders."11 The
capacities of unmanned combat systems include effectively reducing
casualties, achieving accurate reconnaissance, striking, resupplying,
configuring flexible activities, and significantly improving combat
effectiveness---to list only a few of many such advantages. With the
development of unmanned technology, human warfare places more and more
value upon information, which AI and unmanned systems excel at
procuring. China's development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) began
in the late 1950s.12 In 1959, it had basically figured out the law of
self-pilot takeoff and landing of two types of aircraft, namely the An-2
and IL-28. In the mid to late 1960s, China had been investing in the
development of UAVs and formed a series of target aircraft such as the
Changkong-1 radio-controlled target UAV, the DR-5 high-altitude photo
reconnaissance aircraft, and the D4 small remote-controlled aircraft.
Moreover, in August 1958, the first unmanned aircraft developed by
Northwestern Polytechnic University flew successfully, and in 1984, the
university established the UAV Research Institute with the approval of
the former Ministry of Aviation Industry. In the1970s, China developed
ChangHong high-altitude high-speed unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, T-6
general-purpose unmanned aircraft, Z-5 series unmanned reconnaissance
aircraft, ASN series unmanned aircraft, and so forth. Dozens of these
target and reconnaissance UAVs have been mass-produced and deployed
alongside troops. The emergence of a large number of Chinese military
UAVs began in 2006, when a number of military UAV designs appeared
publicly in the limelight, such as the "Xianglong" high-altitude
high-speed unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, whose body design is very
similar to the US "Global Hawk" high-altitude long-endurance
reconnaissance UAV; the "Skyhawk-3" unmanned helicopter that can hover,
take off, and land vertically; and the "Dark Sword" UAV shaped like a
US-made stealth bomber, which can burst into the enemy's airspace with
its stealth and high-speed performance and conduct suppressive attacks
on the enemy's air defense forces.13 The PLA is equipped with at least
four types of medium and large UAVs, namely the EA-03 Xianglong, the
Attack 1 (Wing Dragon 1), the JWP02 (ASN-206), and the BZK-005 UAV.
EA-03 Xianglong is China's most advanced high-altitude long-endurance
unmanned reconnaissance aircraft in service. With a status similar to
that of the US RQ4 global-use UAV, it is mainly adopted for
high-altitude strategic surveillance reconnaissance. The aircraft has an
overall length of 14.33 meters, a wingspan of 24.86 meters, a normal
takeoff weight of 6,800 kilograms, a mission load of 600 kilograms and
an effective flight range of 7,000 kilometers. It can conduct continuous
aerial surveillance for 10 hours at an altitude of 18,000 meters from
2,000 kilometers away. The front and rear wings are connected in a
diamond shape, which greatly strengthens the stiffness of the wings with
a certain stealth capability.14 During the standoff in DongLang in the
in last year between China and India, three Xianglong aircraft had
appeared at Shigatse airport, and this confirmed that troops have been
equipped with the aircraft. The Attack-1, improved from Chengfei
Institute\'s Yilong-1 (sometimes call the Wing Loong), was unveiled at
the 2014 Zhuhai Airshow and was the first active PLA inspection and
fighter UAV that was made public at the airshow. Its shape is similar to
that of the US UAV MQ-9, while its size is similar to that of the MQ-1
Predator. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 1.2 tons, a length of 9
meters, a wingspan of 14 meters, a payload of 200 kilograms, a maximum
lift of 5,300 meters and a range of 4,000 kilometers. The latest
Yilong-2 has a major improvement in both size and performance, with a
length of 11 meters, a wingspan of 20.5 meters, a maximum flight
altitude of 9,000 meters, a maximum speed of 370 kilometers per hour, a
maximum takeoff weight of 4.2 tons, and an external hang-up capacity of
480 kilograms. It is equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) as
well as laser-guided missiles and GPS-guided bombs and is able to
perform continuous missions for 20 hours. To date, there has been no
news that the Yilong-2 has been put into service.15 The JWP02 UAV
(ASN-206) was developed by the Xi'an Aisheng Group of Northwestern
Polytechnic University and won the first prize of the National Science
and Technology Progress Award in 1996. It is rumored that it had
received technical support from Israel. The aircraft applies solid
rockets in assisting flight, zero-length launch, parachute landing and
recovery, and can be used multiple times. It has a maximum takeoff
weight of 222 kilograms, mission equipment weight of 50 kilograms,
practical lift of 6,000 meters, range of 150 kilometers, and endurance
of four to eight hours. The aircraft, which was developed earlier than
Attack-1 UAV, currently serves as the mainstay of China\'s tactical
unmanned reconnaissance aircraft along with the Attack-1 UAV.16 BZK-005
UAV has certain stealth capability and is a medium and high-altitude
long-range unmanned reconnaissance aircraft. It has a maximum lift of
8,000 meters, an endurance of 40 hours, a maximum takeoff weight of 1.25
tons and a maximum carrying weight of 150 kilograms. Early models are
equipped with photoelectric pods, while the latest models are equipped
with SAR and other electronic reconnaissance equipment. The media
reported that the aircraft has been on a patrol flight mission in the
East China Sea. The TYW1 Skyhawk UAV, which was developed on the basis
of the BZK-005, rolled off the production line on November 14, 2017. It
is reported that the maximum takeoff weight of the TYW-1 has increased
to 1.5 tons, with a maximum bomb load of 300 kilograms.17 UAVs play
three important roles in military applications, the first of which is
reconnaissance and surveillance.18 UAVs can penetrate hundreds of
kilometers or more behind enemy lines and are configured at high,
medium, and low altitudes. They can provide important reference for
strategic decision-making and battle command in large-scale military
operations through scanning reconnaissance and close-in reconnaissance
to obtain highly accurate intelligence information. The latter is very
suitable for [PLA military, divisional, and brigade-level forces of the
PLA Marine Corps to conduct battlefield reconnaissance surveillance,
target search and location]{.underline}, as well as battle results
assessment. UAVs can also work with satellites and skywave
over-the-horizon radar [to search and track enemy maritime
targets]{.underline} and transmit back target information in real time.
In this way, military UAVs can become an important part of the "kill
chain" in antiaircraft-carrier warfare. The second is electronic
jamming.19 Electronic-jamming UAVs can fly over the enemy, emitting
electromagnetic waves through their airborne equipment and the
application of interference foil, and so forth to implement interference
on the enemy's air defense radar, fire control radar, early warning
systems, and other electronic equipment to cover China\'s aircraft
defense and ground attack. The third role is firepower destruction. In
addition to antiradiation UAVs that can destruct the enemy's radar and
other electromagnetic equipment, attack UAVs, inspection and fighter
UAVs, and so forth can also carry out effective firepower destruction
against the enemy. Acquisition of UAV technologies has enhanced China's
confidence to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance tasks to protect
claimed territory. In the early 2010s, China for the first time sent a
UAV to the Diaoyu Dao/ Senkaku Island disputed area.20 It was able to
easily avoid the detection of Japanese ground radar, which surprised the
Japanese coast guard. It was only a short and tactical victory that the
Chinese UAVs exploited the loopholes in Japan\'s air defense system and
reached the Diaoyu Islands for cruising with an ultra-low-altitude blind
spot; it did not change the strategic pattern of the Japanese side's
effective control over the Diaoyu Islands. The most common unmanned
aircraft to cruise the Diaoyu Islands is the BZK-005 unmanned
reconnaissance aircraft---equipped with a rear-propelled engine, a
dual-tail brace structure and an under-nose photoelectric/infrared
detection device---first unveiled at the Zhuhai Airshow in 2006 and
capable of flying continuously for 40 hours at an altitude of 26,000
feet.21 The BZK-005's primary detection system is an electro-optical pod
under the nose, which is equipped with a forward-looking infrared
detection system, CCD cameras, and a laser range/target designation
system. Wave-transparent materials are applied in the BZK-005 UAV; thus,
it can be determined that it has a satellite communication system that
can transmit information to the rear over radio range, which also
indicates that the BZK-005 should have an activity radius of more than
1,000 kilometers. The application of the BZK-005 UAV has effectively
enhanced the capability of China\'s naval maritime integrated
surveillance system. At present, the quantity and quality of China\'s
naval maritime surveillance aircraft are insufficient, and the
application of the BZK-005 can improve the capability and coverage of
China\'s naval target detection and indication system, especially for
accurate detection and identification of targets in the middle and near
sea, which helps China to comprehensively grasp the real-time situation
in the relevant sea areas and provides support for relevant decision
making. For nearly a decade since China sent the BZK-005 to the Diaoyu
Island area without alerting Japan, Japan has been cooperating with the
United States to equip itself by importing UAVs. Early this year,
Japanese media reported that the United States and Japan are currently
discussing a military deployment against China. According to the report,
the United States and Japan plan to deploy MQ-9 UAVs near Kagoshima, a
move designed to "respond to China\'s" regular military operations.22
UAVs are characterized by high speed and high altitude. The MQ-9 made
its first flight in 2014 after improvements were made, and then it was
used by the US military. It is understood that the UAV deployed in
Kagoshima is a reconnaissance type and it is also the first time the
United States deployed this high-altitude type of UAV in Japan. With the
US pivots in Asia, tensions between the two giants, namely China and the
United States, have been inevitable. Located in the southwestern tip of
Japan, Kagoshima has a very special geographical location in that, if
the United States deploys the MQ-9 UAV on the island, it will obtain the
information about the activities of the Chinese naval fleet. In other
words, the MQ-9 UAV is the US "eye" planted in the vicinity of China for
receiving information. In addition, the specific location of the US
deployment of the MQ-9 UAV is also thought-provoking, for the reason
that to the further south of Kagoshima, there are the Okinawa Islands,
followed by the Miyako Strait waters. This area is the "treasure land"
that is of great military importance. When the United States and Japan
intervenes in the Taiwan Strait conflict, should it occur, the Miyako
Strait waters are the shortest cut they must go through. Obviously,
China is also aware of this problem. Therefore, China should pay close
attention to the Miyako Strait when the cross-strait unification attack
commences, if this is the only way. In this context, the US UAVs
deployed in Kagoshima are the main means of reconnaissance for the
United States and Japan. [The UAVs must not only watch out for the moves
of the Chinese side, but also conduct reconnaissance of Chinese defense
networks.]{.underline} UAVs are not only used in the East China Sea
area, but also the South China Sea area. Even in the border conflicts
between China and India, UAVs were also applied. Despite that there has
not been any offensive action taken by UAVs in the mentioned areas, one
cannot deny the potential there. Considering the unstable situation in
the Indo-Pacific, states either focus on AI technologies research,
including UAVs, or import arms and technologies from others. It is still
unknown that whether the applications of AI technology will eventually
arouse an arm race. Concerns The advanced AI technologies that are
applied in the military field can exert great impact on deterrence and
warfare in the future. Meanwhile, China's rapid development of AI
technologies and applications in its military are cause for increasing
concern by the United States. Despite the success of China's AI in
commercial areas, no clear evidence has indicated that China's military
has plans to apply AI in any lethal systems. In the short term,
weaknesses still exist despite China's preexisting foundation on AI
commercial applications. Allen points out that China has disadvantages
in top talents and technical standards, as well as in software
frameworks and platforms.23 For example, the case of restrictions on ZTE
and Huawei clearly reveals that China heavily depends on imports of
critical products, which means that China still has a long way to go
until it becomes fully independent in vital sectors, such as
semiconductors. AI technology itself is not offensive, but [it is likely
to play an irreplaceable directorial role in warfare if it is applied to
automating weapons]{.underline}, especially nuclear weapons. To avoid
unwanted jeopardy to any nations, the top priority is to ensure human
intervention is involved in AI that are applied in security-related
areas. AI actually lowers the threshold of offensive military actions
because of the limited casualty risk. States, including China and the
United States, should cooperate on preventing the abuse of AI. According
to the China Global Television Network, China is the first nation that
has submitted the position paper to the United Nations Convention on
Certain Conventional Weapons for regulating the application of AI
technologies in military field in December 2021.24 In other words, as
with the control of nuclear weapons, norms and regulations are needed to
limit the use of AI armaments. The [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is concerned about the global
prolif]{.underline}eration [of unmanned systems]{.underline} and other
AI weapons [since China lacks export restrictions.]{.underline} [China's
purposes of exporting unmanned arms, such as UAVs, include but are not
limited to protecting overseas Chinese and investment security,
establishing and consolidating diplomatic relations, and creating
commercial profits.]{.underline}25 The United States is concerned about
the unrestricted export for not only security reasons, but also economic
ones. To prevent China from occupying the international market of
unmanned systems, previous president Donald Trump reinterpreted the
Missile Technology Control Regime to boost the export of UAVs. The Biden
administration is willing to continue Trump's policy, which made the
export more flexible.26 Therefore, if both superpowers obtain unmanned
technologies and export the arms mainly for commercial purpose, it is
unnecessary for the United States to raise high concern. Future As for
the future development of China's AI technology applications in the
military area: First, high-altitude long-endurance will be a primary
focus of UAV development. Previous UAVs have a small carrying capacity,
inadequate power supply, and little endurance, which may result in a
small area of reconnaissance, failure to continuously obtain information
for a long time, and even "blind spots" in intelligence, thus it is
difficult for them to adapt to the needs of future warfare.

### Growth Link

#### Slowing Chinese economic growth is vital to preserving US hegemony

Chicago, co-director of Program of International Security Policy at
UChicago (John, "Can China Rise Peacefully," *The Tragedy of Great Power
Politics,* October 25^th^, 2014,

[[There is a]{.underline}]{.mark} small [[possibility China will]{.mark}
eventually [become so powerful that the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will not be
able to contain it]{.underline}]{.mark} and prevent it from dominating
Asia, [[even if the American military remains forward
deployed]{.underline}]{.mark} in that region. China might someday have
far more latent power than any of the four potential hegemons the United
States confronted in the twentieth century. In terms of both population
size and wealth---the building blocks of military power---neither
Wilhelmine Germany, nor imperial Japan, nor Nazi Germany, nor the Soviet
Union came close to matching the United States. Given that China now has
more than four times as many people as the United States and is
projected to have more than three times as many in 2050, Beijing would
enjoy a significant advantage in latent power if it had a per capita GNI
(gross national income) equivalent to that of either Hong Kong or South
Korea. All that [[latent power would allow China to gain a decisive
military advantage]{.mark} over its principal rivals in
Asia,]{.underline} especially when you consider that China would be
operating in its backyard, while the Unites States would be operating
more than 6,000 miles from California. In that circumstance, it is
difficult to see how the United States could prevent China from becoming
a regional hegemon. Moreover, [China would probably be the more
formidable superpower in the ensuing global competition with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. But even if China's GNI does
not rise to those levels, and it ends up with not quite as much latent
power as the United States, it would still be in a good position to make
a run at hegemony in Asia. [All of this tells us [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates **[[has a
profound interest in seeing Chinese economic growth slow
considerably]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the years ahead. [[That outcome
might not be good for American prosperity]{.underline}]{.mark}, much
less for global prosperity, **[[but it would be good for American
security, which is what matters most.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### Impact -- Laundry List

#### Primacy prevents [great-power conflict]{.underline} --- multipolar revisionism [fragments]{.underline} the [global order]{.underline} and causes [nuclear war]{.underline}. 

**Brands & Edel, 19** --- Hal Brands; PhD, Henry A. Kissinger

Advanced International Studies. Charles Edel; PhD, Senior Fellow and
Visiting Scholar at the United States Studies Centre at the University
of Sydney. ("The Lessons of Tragedy: Statecraft and World Order;" Ch. 6:
Darkening Horizon; Published by *Yale University Press*; //GrRv)

Each of these geopolitical challenges is different, and each reflects
the distinctive interests, ambitions, and history of the country
undertaking it. Yet [there is **growing cooperation** between the
countries that are **challenging** the **regional pillars of the
U.S.-led order.** **Russia** and **China** have **collaborated**
on]{.underline} issues such as energy, sales and development of
**[military technology]{.underline}**, opposition to additional U.S.
military deployments on the Korean peninsula, and naval exercises from
the South China Sea to the Baltic. In Syria, [Iran provided the **shock
troops** that helped keep Russia's ally]{.underline}, Bashar [al-Assad,
in power]{.underline}, as Moscow provided the air power and the
diplomatic cover. "[Our **cooperation** can **isolate
America**]{.underline}," supreme leader Ali Khamenei told Putin in 2017.
More broadly, [what links these challenges together is their
**opposition** to the constellation of **power, norms, and
relationships** that the U.S.-led order entails, and in their propensity
to use **violence**]{.underline}, coercion, and intimidation [as means
of making that opposition **effective**]{.underline}. Taken
collectively, [these challenges constitute a **geopolitical sea
change**]{.underline} from the post-Cold War era.

[The revival of [**great-power competition**
entails]{.mark}]{.underline} higher international tensions than the
world has known for decades, and the revival of [[**arms races, security
dilemmas**, and]{.mark} **other artifacts** of a more **dangerous
past**. It entails **[sharper conflicts]{.mark}** over the international
rules]{.underline} of the road on issues ranging from freedom of
navigation to the illegitimacy of altering borders by force, [and
**intensifying competitions** over states that reside at the
intersection of rival powers' **areas of interest**]{.underline}. It
requires confronting the prospect that [[**rival powers** could
**overturn** the]{.mark} **favorable [regional balances]{.mark}** [that
have **underpinned** the U.S.-led order]{.mark} for decades, and that
[they might construct **rival spheres of
influence**]{.mark}]{.underline} from which America and the liberal
ideas it has long promoted would be excluded. Finally, it necessitates
recognizing that [[great-power rivalry could lead to **great-power
war**]{.underline}]{.mark}, a prospect that seemed to have followed the
Soviet empire onto the ash heap of history.

Both [[**Beijing** and **Moscow** are]{.underline}]{.mark}, after all,
[**optimizing their forces** and **[exercising aggressively]{.mark}** in
preparation [for]{.mark} potential **[conflicts]{.mark}** with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and its allies; [[Russian
doctrine]{.mark} explicitly [emphasizes the]{.mark}]{.underline} limited
[[use of **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark} to achieve escalation
dominance in a war with Washington. In Syria, [U.S. and Russian forces
even came into **deadly contact**]{.underline} in early 2018. American
airpower decimated a contingent of government-sponsored Russian
mercenaries that was attacking a base at which U.S. troops were present,
an incident demonstrating the increasing boldness of Russian operations
and the corresponding potential for escalation. [[The
world]{.underline}]{.mark} has not yet returned to the epic clashes for
global dominance that characterized the twentieth century, but it [[has
returned to]{.mark} the **historical norm** of **[great-power
struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with all the associated dangers.

Those dangers may be even greater than most observers appreciate,
because if today's great-power competitions are still most intense at
the regional level, who is to say where these competitions will end? By
all appearances, [[Russia **does not**]{.mark} **simply [want to
be]{.mark}** [a "**regional power**"]{.mark}]{.underline} (as Obama
cuttingly described it) that dominates South Ossetia and Crimea.37 [[It
**aspires** to]{.mark} the **deep Europe[an]{.mark}** and
**[extra-regional impact]{.mark}** that **previous incarnations** of the
Russian state enjoyed]{.underline}. Why else would Putin boast about how
far his troops can drive into Eastern Europe? [[**Why else** would
Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} be **[[deploy]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing
military power [[into the **Midd**]{.mark}**le
[East?]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**Why else** would it be continuing to
cultivate]{.underline} intelligence and [**military relationships** in
regions as remote as **Latin America?**]{.underline}

Likewise, [[China]{.mark} is **today** focused primarily on securing its
own **geopolitical neighborhood**, but it[s]{.mark} [ambitions]{.mark}
for **tomorrow** [are]{.mark} **clearly much
[bolde]{.mark}r.**]{.underline} Beijing probably does not envision
itself fully overthrowing the international order, simply because it has
profited far too much from the U.S.-anchored global economy. Yet [China
has nonetheless positioned itself for a **global challenge** to **U.S.
influence**]{.underline}. [[Chinese military forces are deploying **ever
farther**]{.mark} from China's immediate periphery; [Beijing has
**projected power** into the **Arctic** and **established
bases**]{.mark} and **logistical points** [in]{.mark} the
**[India]{.mark}n Ocean** [and]{.mark} **Horn of
[Africa]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Popular Chinese movies depict Beijing
replacing Washington as the dominant actor in sub-Saharan Africa---a
fictional representation of a real-life effort long under way. [The
**Belt and Road Initiative** bespeaks an aspiration to **link** China to
countries throughout **Central Asia, the Middle East, and
Europe**]{.underline}; BRI, AIIB, and RCEP look like the beginning of an
alternative institutional architecture to rival Washington's. In 2017,
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [[told the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Nineteenth National Congress of the [C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist
[P]{.mark}arty that [Beijing could]{.mark}]{.underline} now "**[[take
center stage]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}**" [[and act as an
**alternative** to **U.S. leadership**]{.underline}]{.mark}.38

These ambitions may or may not be realistic. But they demonstrate just
how significantly the world's leading authoritarian powers desire to
shift the global environment over time. The
**[[revisionism]{.underline}]{.mark}** we are seeing today [[may]{.mark}
therefore [be **only the beginning**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
[[China]{.mark}'s power **continues to grow,** or if it is successful in
**dominating the Western Pacific**, it [will]{.mark} **surely [move
on]{.mark}** [to **grander endeavors**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If Russia
reconsolidates control over the former Soviet space, it may seek to
bring parts of the former Warsaw Pact to heel. Historically, [this has
been a recurring pattern of **great-power behavior**---interests
**expand with power**, the appetite **grows** with the eating,
**risk-taking** increases as **early gambles** are seen to **pay
off**]{.underline}.39 This pattern is precisely why the revival of
great-power competition is so concerning---because [**[geopolitical
revisionism]{.mark}** by **unsatisfied major powers** [has]{.mark} so
often [presaged **intensifying international
conflict**]{.mark},]{.underline} confrontation,
[[and]{.mark}]{.underline} even **[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
great-power behavior occurring today represents the warning light
flashing on the dashboard. It tells us there may be still-greater
traumas to come.

The threats today are compelling and urgent, and there may someday come
a time when the balance of power has shifted so markedly that the
postwar international system cannot be sustained. Yet that moment of
failure has not yet arrived, and so the goal of U.S. strategy should be
not to hasten it by giving up prematurely, but to push it off as far
into the future as possible. Rather [than simply
**acquiescing**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the
**[decline]{.underline}** of a world it spent generations building,
[[America should]{.mark} **aggressively [bolster its
defenses]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} with an eye to **preserving** and perhaps
even selectively **advancing** its remarkable achievements.]{.underline}

#### A [receding]{.underline} US deterrent is a [catalyst]{.underline} for [great-power conflict]{.underline} --- decline causes [transition wars]{.underline} and [miscalculation]{.underline}.

Moreover, [[if discussions of]{.mark} "[international order]{.mark}"
[can]{.mark} quickly [take on an **abstract quality**, the
**consequences of collapse**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[the **lives
lost**]{.underline} or ruptured, the prosperity destroyed, [the **moral
depravities** committed]{.underline}---[[can be **frighteningly
concrete**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thucydides had it right when he
described what happens in such a vacuum of security and morality: "Death
thus raged in every shape ... there was no length to which violence did
not go."3 This is all indisputably ~~depressing~~, but it should not be
the least bit surprising. If it were possible to construct an
international system that was truly universal in its appeal; if it were
possible to freeze global power relationships at that moment of
creation; [[if it were possible for states to **put aside the**]{.mark}
very human ambitions, emotions, and [**fears** that **drive their
behavior**]{.mark}:]{.underline} [then, perhaps, [the world
could]{.mark} **permanently [escape]{.mark}** the **[competitive
impulses]{.mark}** that make international orders **impermanent** and
their demise **so traumatic**]{.underline}. [[**But**]{.mark} **none of
this** has **ever** been possible]{.underline}. [**International
orders**, even the most **inclusive** ones, create winners and losers
because they benefit states **unequally**.]{.underline} [The power
balances that underpin a given system **shift over time**, encouraging
**new tests of strength**]{.underline}. And although the human desire
for peace and prosperity is strong, [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[remain **motivated** by]{.underline}]{.mark} ideological passion,
greed, and **[[insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The most **successful
orders** can mitigate the **effects** of these dynamics]{.underline};
they can suppress the sources of conflict and upheaval. [But they cannot
**eliminate them entirely**.]{.underline} This point is essential in
considering the trajectory of the post-1945 order. [It is tempting for
individuals in nearly every geopolitical era to believe that their world
is somehow different---that it is **immune** to the **dangers of
conflict** and **collapse**]{.underline}. [It is **alluring** to think
that progress can be **self-sustaining**, and that **liberal principles
can triumph** even if liberal **actors** are **no longer
preeminent**.]{.underline} To do so, however, is to fall prey to the
same ahistorical mindset that so predictably precedes the fall. Yes,
[the American order is **exceptional** in the level of **stability,
prosperity**, and **liberal dominance** it has provided]{.underline},
and in the level of consent it has generated from countries around the
world. [Yet it is **not so exceptional** as to be **exempt** from the
dangers of decline and decay.]{.underline} As the Greeks surely would
have realized, in fact, it is precisely when one succumbs to the
illusion that tragedy is impossible that tragedy becomes all the more
likely. II This leads to a second component of a tragic sensibility---an
appreciation that tragedy is once again stalking global affairs. The
U.S.-led system is undoubtedly strong and resilient in many respects, as
shown by the simple fact that it has survived as long as it has. Yet
what endured in the past is not destined to endure in the future, and
today the structure is groaning as the stresses mount. [**Long-standing
principles** such as **nonaggression** and **freedom of** **navigation**
are being **undermined** from Eastern Europe to the South China
Sea]{.underline}. International predators like North Korea and radical
jihadist groups are using creative, asymmetric strategies to cause
geopolitical disruption out of all proportion to their material power.
The democratic wave has receded amid the growing prevalence and power of
authoritarianism. [**[Revisionist]{.mark} autocracie[s]{.mark}**
[are]{.mark} **[reshaping regional environments]{.mark}** in Europe, the
Middle East, and East Asia, [and]{.mark} waging **sophisticated
assaults** against the **political systems** and **geopolitical
positions** of their **competitors**]{.underline}. [These countries are
[building]{.mark} **privileged [spheres of influence]{.mark}** in
**critical areas** of the globe;]{.underline} they are casting ever
longer shadows, both strategic and ideological, across the international
landscape. Meanwhile, the countries with the most to lose should the
current system crack are too often divided and demoralized; their
strategic torpor and distraction are creating vacuums that the
revisionists are all too happy to fill. The protectors of the post-1945
order seem stuck in neutral, or even reverse, as the attackers push
forward. This has historically been a dangerous combination. [Faced with
this **daunting panorama**, some analysts will take refuge in the hope
that these challenges will simply **exhaust themselves**, or that
revisionist powers will be satiated once their **regional ambitions are
fulfilled**]{.underline}. [Yet most systems tend toward **more**, rather
than **less, entropy over time**, meaning that more, rather than less,
**energy** is **required to stabilize them**]{.underline}. And
[[**revisionist powers** **rarely**]{.mark} reach some **natural point
at** which their aspirations **[subside]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [[those
aspirations often **grow** with **each success**]{.underline}]{.mark}.4
Today, the dissatisfied dictatorships, especially [**Russia** and
**China**]{.underline}, [see themselves as being locked in a form of
**geopolitical conflict** with the **United States**;]{.underline} [they
are already using **force** and]{.underline} other types of
[**coercion** to **chip away** at the American order]{.underline}.
[[Should they succeed in **claiming regional primacy** and
reestablishing a **spheres-of-influence world**, the result
would]{.mark} be not to **dampen** but to [**inflame international
conflict.** **Competition**]{.mark} among the great powers [would
**intensify** as **hostile spheres rub up against one another**]{.mark};
the security of the **global commons---**the **foundation** of
**international prosperity**---would be threatened by **escalating
geopolitical rivalry**]{.underline}. The prospects for
self-determination and liberalism would fade as small states fall under
the sway of stronger, authoritarian neighbors. And crucially, as Daniel
Twining notes, [[**regional dominance** could serve as a "**springboard
for global contestation**"]{.mark}---for the **renewed clashes for
systemic dominance**]{.underline} that Americans thought they had left
behind with the end of the Cold War.5 It is impossible to predict
precisely when the pressures on the existing order might become
unbearable, or to know how close we are to that critical inflection
point at which the dangers metastasize and the pace of decay
dramatically accelerates. One can only speculate what the terminal
crisis of the system will look like if and when it occurs. What is clear
is that the [**telltale signs of erosion** are **already ubiquitous**
and the trend-lines are **running in the wrong direction**]{.underline}.
The first step toward recovery is admitting you have a problem. Having a
tragic sensibility requires seeing the world for what it is and where it
is going, especially when the outlook is ominous. III If the
international order is under strain, [however, it does not follow that
its **collapse is unavoidable**]{.underline}. Here a third aspect of a
tragic sensibility is vital: the ability to reject complacency without
falling into fatalism. Nietzsche defined tragic pleasure as the
"reaffirmation of the will to live in the face of death."6 It was just
such a rejection of fatalism---of the belief that the next great global
crackup was inevitable---that motivated U.S. policymakers to create the
post-1945 order and sustain it through the crises that followed. Today,
it is true enough that the grandest aspirations of the post--Cold War
era are unlikely to be fulfilled anytime soon. Given the instability and
revisionism roiling the international environment, it is simply beyond
America's power---if it was ever possible in the first place---to create
a truly global order in which liberal values are universal, geopolitical
competition has ceased, and authoritarian rivals have been fully
pacified and converted into "responsible stakeholders." Yet the existing
international order, incomplete and threatened as it is, still
constitutes a remarkable historical achievement. [The creation of a
**global balance of power** that favors]{.underline} the democracies,
[the prevention of **unchecked aggression** and
**intimidation**]{.underline} by predatory powers, [and the promotion of
a **prosperous** and an **integrated world** in which liberal values
have achieved **great prevalence** are **all triumphs worth
preservin**g]{.underline}. [[A]{.mark} more **[reasonable
goal]{.mark}**]{.underline}, then, [[would be to **defend this existing
order**]{.mark} against the depredations of those attacking it, and
[America **undoubtedly has the power** for this]{.mark} **essential
[undertaking]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### AT: China Leadership Good

#### Letting China surpass the US ensures [geopolitical chaos]{.underline} and [great-power war]{.underline}.

Conflict;\" *National Interest*;

//GrRv)

What does the DOD mean by "order?" In the field of international
relations, the terms "revisionist state" and "status-quo state" are used
to describe, respectively, countries that seek to change the current
international system and those that uphold it. In the twentieth and
twenty-first centuries, [the international system has been defined by
**American hegemony** and the **spread** of]{.underline} Western liberal
**[democracy]{.underline}** rather than its challengers---notably,
fascism and socialism. [This is]{.underline} commonly referred to as
[the **liberal world order.**]{.underline}

Under that world order, [the United States]{.underline} is the most
powerful country in the world. It often intervenes in international
conflicts at a high cost, thus [keep]{.underline}ing [**dissatisfied
nations** from **overturning the system**]{.underline}. The NDS,
however, refers to a recent shift in the current world order with an
observation that, "[[We are facing **global disorder**, characterized by
**decline** in the]{.underline}]{.mark} long-standing rules-based
[[international order]{.underline}]{.mark}."

The basis for that observation is the argument that the United States
under the Obama administration took a brief, but arguably consequential,
step back from the job of world-order maintenance. As proof of this,
foreign-policy pundits often refer to Obama's favorite quote (which he
got from Martin Luther King Jr., who in turn got it from a
nineteenth-century clergyman named Theodore Parker): "\[T\]he arc of the
moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice." The implication of
this quote is that history is ultimately on the side of good rather than
evil (e.g., dictatorships), and therefore the United States needn't
concern itself with great power competition or world order strategy.
Critics point out that the president's faith in that sentiment was put
to poor use, however, because it led him to apologize for American power
and to enact [a more **restrained foreign policy** that in turn allowed
**revisionist states** like Russia, China and Iran to **flourish** at
the expense of their respective regions' security]{.underline}. As
Charles Krauthammer harshly wrote in the final months of the
administration: "[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} consequent **[[withdrawal of
American power]{.underline}]{.mark}** ... [[has
yielded]{.underline}]{.mark} nothing but [[**geopolitical chaos** and
**immense human suffering**]{.underline}]{.mark}. (See Syria.)."

And that\'s not exactly a partisan argument either. In addition to
conservative critics like Krauthammer, left-leaning foreign policy
scholars, like Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institute, also have been
critical of the results of the Obama administration\'s well-intentioned
foreign policy.

The NDS promises to reverse the "arc of history" approach to security
policy with a three-tiered approach that prioritizes the "revisionist
powers" of China and Russia, then "rogue regimes" like Iran and North
Korea, and finally "nonstate actors" such as ISIS.

Of course, this new approach may alleviate serious concerns about the
NSS---including my own---that the United States government no longer
cares about global security. But policy will only follow well-written
sentiment if President Trump himself can accept that [America is the
**glue** holding together an **entire world order**]{.underline}.

[With China **now poised** to **reclaim its previous spot** in world
history as a global hegemon, the proverbial clock is turning
back]{.underline}. And that appears to be the reason why the DOD is
serious about America being in the business of world order maintenance.
As stated in the NDS: "Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism,
is now the primary concern in U.S. national security."

Indeed, [China already has a **strong economy**. It represents almost
**15 percent** of the **global GDP**]{.underline} to America's roughly
24 percent. But, to put that in a slightly different perspective, China
has grown astronomically in the last decade to overtake Japan as the
second largest global economy. [Thus, [there is a real possibility that
in the near future]{.mark}]{.underline} (likely decades) [[it may be
able to surpass even the United States and]{.mark} then harness its
capital to [develop **superior military
tech**]{.mark}**nology**]{.underline}. [[At **that point,** China
would]{.mark} be capable of **[overthrow]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} current
[international system.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[The world has **not seen global conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} the
likes of World War I and II [[since the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[became the **dominant power**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nor, for that
matter, has it seen a recurrence of the great power conflicts of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As the new defense strategy
implies, [[take **U.S. hegemony** out of that equation and **great
powers** may **clash** ]{.mark}**once again** to the detriment of a
cherished world order.]{.underline}

### AT: Multipolarity

#### Multipolarity fails---it generates violent fill in and risks nuclear war

**Kagan 19**---(Robert Kagan, Senior fellow at the Brookings Institute
and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, "The Jungle Grows
Back: America and Our Imperiled World", Alfred A. Knopf)//ND

At the root of such thinking is the belief that there is an escape from
power or that it is possible to wield power without error and without
failure. [Americans]{.underline}, blessed by their favorable geography
and wealth, still [believe they have a choice between engaging the world
and letting the world fend for itself]{.underline}. [There has been no
shortage of realists, idealists, progressives, and conservatives telling
them that substantially disengaging from our alliances and overseas
commitments is possible and cost-free]{.underline}. But the real choice
we face is not between the good and the bad but between the bad and the
worse. [It is between maintaining the liberal world order,]{.underline}
with all the moral and material costs that entails[, or letting it
collapse and courting the catastrophes that must inevitably follow.
**What is likely to follow is a return to the multipolar power struggles
that brought so much devastation to the world before the United States
redirected the course of history.**]{.underline} That is where the deep
ruts lead, back to the state of the world prior to 1945. [Only this
time, the powers competing and clashing will be armed with nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} It is ironic that some of those who spent the Cold
War warning that America's hawkish foreign policies would result in
nuclear holocaust do not seem "democracies would result in nuclear
holocaust do not seem to fear nuclear war in the competitive multipolar
world that may be our future. We have yet to test the question of
whether nations with nuclear weapons can go to war, because so far the
United States and the liberal world order have prevented such wars. But
[if history is any guide, to count on the horror of new weaponry alone
to maintain the peace is a most risky bet.]{.underline} Had you cast
that bet before the two world wars, you would have lost. These days some
experts tell us [it was the existence of nuclear weapons that prevented
the United States and the Soviet Union from coming to blows, but few at
the time had any confidence that nuclear weapons were a guarantor of
peace.]{.underline} Throughout much of the Cold War there were those who
simply assumed that the world was heading inevitably toward Armageddon.
They were wrong that it would come as a result of American Cold War
policies, but in the long run they may still prove right.

### China Revisionist

#### China is revisionist -- territorial expansion, 5-year plans, and anti-democratic innovation on all fronts

**Beckley 22** -- *Jeane Kirkpatrick Visiting Scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute, associate professor at Tufts University* (Michael,

ENTER THE DRAGON There has never been any doubt about what China wants,
because [Chinese leaders have declared the same objectives for decades:
to keep the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in power, reabsorb Taiwan,
control the East China and South China Seas, and return China to its
rightful place as the dominant power in Asia]{.underline} and the most
powerful country in the world. For most of the past four decades, the
country took a relatively patient and peaceful approach to achieving
these aims. Focused on economic growth and fearful of being shunned by
the international community, China adopted a "peaceful rise" strategy,
relying primarily on economic clout to advance its interests and
generally following a maxim of the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping: "Hide
your strength, bide your time." In recent years, however, [China has
expanded aggressively on multiple fronts. "Wolf Warrior" diplomacy has
replaced friendship diplomacy. Perceived slights from foreigners, no
matter how small, are met with North Korean--style
condemnation]{.underline}. A combative attitude has seeped into every
part of China's foreign policy, and it is confronting many countries
with their gravest threat in generations. This threat is [most apparent
in maritime East Asia, where China is moving aggressively to cement its
vast territorial claims. Beijing is churning out warships faster than
any country has since World War II, and it has flooded Asian sea-lanes
with Chinese coast guard and fishing vessel]{.underline}s. It has
[strung military outposts across the South China Sea and dramatically
increased its use of ship ramming and aerial interceptions]{.underline}
to shove neighbors out of disputed areas. In the Taiwan Strait[, Chinese
military patrols, some involving a dozen warships and more than 50
combat aircraft, prowl the sea almost daily and simulate attacks on
Taiwanese and U.S. targets.]{.underline} [Chinese officials have told
Western analysts that calls for an invasion of Taiwan are proliferating
within the CCP.]{.underline} Pentagon officials worry that such an
assault could be imminent. C[hina has gone on the economic offensive,
too. Its latest five-year plan calls for dominating what Chinese
officials call "chokepoints"---goods and services that other countries
can't live without]{.underline}---and then using that dominance, plus
the lure of China's domestic market, to browbeat countries into
concessions. Toward that end[, China has become the dominant dispenser
of overseas loans, loading up more than 150 countries with over \$1
trillion of debt.]{.underline} It [has massively subsidized strategic
industries to gain a monopoly on hundreds of vital products, and it has
installed the hardware for digital networks in dozens of
countries]{.underline}. Armed with economic leverage, it has used
coercion against more than a dozen countries over the last few years. In
many cases, the punishment has been disproportionate to the supposed
crime---for example, slapping tariffs on many of Australia's exports
after that country requested an international investigation into the
origins of COVID-19. [China has also become a potent antidemocratic
force, selling advanced tools of tyranny around the world. By combining
surveillance cameras with social media monitoring, artificial
intelligence, biometrics, and speech and facial recognition
technologies]{.underline}, the Chinese government has pioneered a system
that allows dictators to watch citizens constantly and punish them
instantly by blocking their access to finance, education, employment,
telecommunications, or travel. The apparatus is a despot's dream, and
Chinese companies are already selling and operating aspects of it in
more than 80 countries.

#### Western encirclement, aging populations, and attempted expansion prove China is a volatile revisionist power on the verge of lash-out

Red Flags [Most debate on America\'s China policy focuses on the dangers
of a rising and confident China.]{.underline}3 But the [United States
actually faces a more complex and volatile threat]{.underline}: an
already [powerful but increasingly insecure China beset by internal
problems and a brewing international backlash]{.underline}. [China
already has the money and muscle to challenge the United
States]{.underline} in key areas. Thanks to decades of rapid growth[,
China boasts the world\'s largest economy]{.underline} (measured by
purchasing power parity), [manufacturing output, trade surplus,
financial reserves, navy by number of ships, and conventional missile
force]{.underline}. [Chinese nationals lead four of the 15 United
Nations specialized agencies.4 Chinese investments and loans span the
globe, and Beijing is pushing for primacy in key technologies such as 5G
telecommunications and artificial intelligence]{.underline} (AI).5 Add
in that the American-led world order has experienced four years of
geopolitical disarray under President Donald Trump and that much of the
world has suffered through many months of a crippling COVID-19 pandemic,
and it is [hardly surprising that Beijing is testing the status quo
everywhere from the South China Sea to the border with
China]{.underline}. But [China\'s geopolitical window of opportunity may
be closing as fast as it opened. Since 2007, China\'s annual economic
growth rate has dropped by more than half]{.underline}, and
[productivity has declined by nearly 10 percent]{.underline}, meaning
that [China is spending more to produce less]{.underline}.6 Meanwhile,
[debt has ballooned eightfold]{.underline} and is on pace to total 335
percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2020.7 No country has
racked up so much debt so fast in peacetime. [China has little hope of
reversing these trends, because it is about to suffer the worst aging
crisis in history]{.underline}. Over the next 30 years, [China will lose
200 million working-age adults and gain 300 million senior
citizens]{.underline}./8 Any country that has aged, accu-mulated debt,
or lost productivity at anything close to China\'s current pace has lost
at least one decade to near-zero economic growth. And [as economic
growth falls, the dangers of social and political unrest rise./9
China\'s leaders are well aware of these trends./10 President Xi Jinping
has given multiple internal speeches warning party members of the
potential for a Soviet-style collapse./11 China\'s gov-ernment has
outlawed negative economic news, and Chinese elites are moving their
money and children out of the country en masse./]{.underline}12
Meanwhile, [China faces a rising wave of foreign hostility. According to
leaked Chinese government reports and independent Western analyses,
nega-tive views of China have soared to highs not seen since the
Tiananmen Square massacre]{.underline} of 1989./13 This surge of
anti-China sentiment [is a response to Beijing\'s internal repression
and external assertiveness]{.underline}, and it is [now manifesting in
ways that threaten to crush China\'s geopolitical ambitions. Nearly a
dozen countries have suspended or canceled their participation in Belt
and Road Initiative projects]{.underline}./14 Another 16 countries,
including [eight of the world\'s 10 largest economies, have banned or
severely restricted use of Huawei products]{.underline} in their 5G
networks./15 [India has been turning hard against China,]{.underline}
since a clash between the two countries killed 20 soldiers in June.
[Japan has ramped up military spending, turned amphibious ships into
aircraft carriers,]{.underline} and strung missile launchers along the
Ryukyu Islands near Taiwan, where a record number of citizens now
identify solely as Taiwanese, not Chinese./[16 The European Union has
labeled China a \"systemic rival,\" and Europe\'s three great
powers\--France, Germany, and the United Kingdom\--are sending naval
patrols to counter Beijing\'s expansion]{.underline} in the South China
Sea and Indian Ocean./17 These [intensifying headwinds will make China a
less competitive long-term rival to the United States but a more
explosive **near-term threat**]{.underline}. Simply put, [it is hard to
see how a country facing so many severe challenges can ultimately
outpace America and its many allies.]{.underline} Yet whereas a rising
[China could afford to shelve disputes and deescalate
crises]{.underline}\--confident that its wealth, power, and status were
growing and that the Chinese Communist Party\'s (CCP) legitimacy was
secure\--[a slowing and increasingly encircled China will be eager to
score geopolitical wins while it still can.]{.underline} There is no
mystery about what China\'s ambitions are, because [the CCP has
enshrined them in national law: to make the Chinese nation whole again;
reunite Taiwan with the mainland; control the East and South China Seas,
thereby turning the western Pacific into a Chinese lake]{.underline};
and restore China\'s status as a great power. [The looming danger is
that China will act more aggressively to achieve them]{.underline} as
its future prospects dim. History Rhymes If China goes down this ugly
path, it wouldn\'t be the first great power to do so. [We tend to think
that rising revisionists pose the greatest danger to the existing
order]{.underline}. \"[It was the rise of Athens and the **fear that
this inspired in Sparta** that made war inevitable,\"]{.underline}
Thucydides wrote. But historically, the most desperate dashes have often
come from dissatisfied powers that had been on the ascent but grew
worried that their time was running short./18 World War I is the classic
example. The growing German challenge to the United Kingdom provided the
strategic background to that conflict. Yet in the foreground in the
run-up to 1914 were nagging German fears of decline. The growth of
Russian military power and strategic mobility was menacing the eastern
flank. New French conscription laws were changing the balance in the
west. A tightening Franco-Russian-British entente was leaving Germany
surrounded. If Berlin did not act quickly, its military strategy\--based
on fighting a two-front war\--would collapse, its dreams of world power
and geopolitical greatness would vanish, and the internal strains caused
by intensifying political clashes might become unmanageable. This was a
principal reason Berlin acted so recklessly during the July crisis\--by
issuing its \"blank check\" to Austria-Hungary and then enacting its
plan for a rapid, two-front war\--despite the obvious peril, as Chief of
General Staff Helmut von Moltke acknowledged, of a continental war that
might \"annihilate the civilization of almost the whole of Europe for
decades to come.\"/19 The same decision-making dynamics were present in
other cases. Imperial Japan made its fatal gamble in 1941, after the US
oil embargo and naval rearma-ment made it clear that Tokyo\'s window to
dominate the Asia-Pacific was closing fast./20 In the 1970s, Soviet
global expansion peaked as Moscow\'s military buildup matured and the
slowing of the Soviet economy created an impetus to lock in geopolitical
gains sooner than later. Even the United States once fit this pattern.
The flurry of American expansion and the buildup of US naval power in
the 1890s came after an economic slump that exacerbated internal
tensions and amid a global upsurge of imperial aggran-dizement that left
some US strategists concerned that Washington would be left behind by
emerging European mega-empires. In some of these instances, [it was
economic dis-tress following a long period of growth that stoked anxious
aggression. In others, it was the onset of strategic encirclement, often
self-provoked, by rival powers]{.underline}. [In all cases, an upsurge
in a revisionist state\'s power gave it the means to challenge the
status quo, but an apparent downturn in its future prospects gave it the
motive to do so boldly, even violently]{.underline}. Given that C[hina
is currently facing both a grim economic forecast and tightening
strategic encirclement, the next few years may prove partic-ularly
turbulent.]{.underline}/21

## Russia Alliance Impact Answers

### Impossible

[[Institutionalization of the Beijing--Moscow relationship remains
low]{.mark}, but a pattern of regular consultation between top leaders
has evolved. [Russia and China also meet annually for bilateral military
and technical co-operation talks]{.mark}]{.underline}, and have
continued to develop the Shanghai Cooperation Organization founded in
2001. China--Russia strategic convergence is a discernible trend which
will gain further momentum. However, **[[strategic convergence should
not be confused with an alliance, and China and Russia are not perfect
strategic partners]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Developments inside China and
Russia are crucial to how the relationship develops. Key questions are
whether political stability will prevail and whether rapid growth can be
sustained. Trenin argues that a **[[Sino--Russian alliance could occur
only as a result of "exceptionally short-sighted and foolish
policies]{.mark} on China and Russia are not pro-Western, but neither
are they definitively anti-Western.]{.underline}** Western policymakers
who are worried about the implications of Sino--Russian strategic
convergence would do well to pursue a policy of engaging both Moscow and
Beijing, and put pressure on Tokyo to resolve the dispute over the
Kurile Islands. Paradoxically, if an alliance, or something resembling
an alliance, were to be formed this could lead to a breakdown of the
relationship in the medium to long term. [China and Russia both command
sufficient resources and sophistication to be significant global powers
in their own right, and they certainly consider themselves as such.
[China was unwilling to subordinate itself to Russia for more than a
brief period after the Communists came to power in 1949,]{.mark} and
Russia would refuse to subordinate itself to China. The most likely
scenario is Sino--Russo strategic convergence based on a relationship of
mutual self-interest]{.underline}. The evidence presented in this
article indicates that trade and investment between China and Russia are
set to continue to grow rapidly, particularly in the energy sector,
further enhancing the significance of the relationship. [[While Beijing
and Moscow have common interests in placing restraints on the power of
the United States]{.mark}, the creation of a full-fledged anti-Western
alliance is unlikely to prove viable in the short term. Russia and
especially China are [both dependent on open access to Western markets
to sustain growth.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Inevitable

#### China will support Russia regardless of how the Ukraine conflict develops 

**Blanchette 22**(Jude Blanchette holds the Freeman chair in China
studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, "The
worse things go for Putin in Ukraine, the more China will back him," The
Washington Post, March 24, 2022 at 4:09 p.m. EDT,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/24/xi-jinping-putin-china-russia-sanctions/>) -
MP

China has tried to have it both ways since Russia invaded Ukraine a
month ago. It abstained from key votes at the United Nations criticizing
Russia's actions, avoided directly labeling President Vladimir Putin's
assault on Ukraine an "invasion," amplified Russian disinformation and
repeatedly laid blame for the war at the feet of the United States and
NATO. At the same time, Beijing has also largely complied with sanctions
against Russia, made repeated, if vague, calls for a negotiated
settlement to the hostilities and provided humanitarian assistance to
Ukraine. But make no mistake: [The worse it goes for Russia in Ukraine,
the more China will step up its support for the Putin regime. Beijing's
uneven diplomatic strategy may seem to stem from a desire to achieve
multiple, often conflicting aims, most notably to forestall a
deterioration in relations with Europe.]{.underline} Not all objectives
are weighted equally, however, and as the war enters a more protracted
and destructive phase, [China's primary goal is coming into focus: to
ensure that Russia retains its status as Beijing's key strategic
partner, even if this necessitates paying serious economic and
diplomatic costs. Beijing will see the prospect of a Russian defeat as a
direct threat to its own territorial security and ability to compete
head-to-head in the geopolitical rivalry with the United
States]{.underline} --- and China simply can't allow that to happen. To
see why Beijing has a direct stake in the war's outcome, it's critical
to understand how its relationship with Russia has evolved since the
collapse of the Soviet Union, and how China views the global security
environment evolving over the next three to five years. Since the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, China and Russia
have experienced significant friction and mutual mistrust. The nadir of
the relationship came in 1969, when the two communist powers nearly
engaged in a nuclear war. Since 1989, however, Beijing and Moscow have
systematically addressed the major points of contention in their
relationship, including any lingering territorial disputes. In 2001, the
countries signed the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly
Cooperation, and after Chinese leader Xi Jinping assumed power in 2013,
cooperation has expanded to include joint military exercises, efforts to
reform global governance and technology sharing[. For example, the two
countries continue to develop a satellite navigation system to rival the
United States' GPS, and in January, Russia and China, along with Iran,
held a series of naval drills in the Indian Ocean]{.underline}. This
growing symbiosis was formalized on Feb. 4 in a joint statement issued
during Putin's visit to Beijing at the start of the Winter Olympics
(Xi's meeting with Putin then was his first with a world leader since
February 2020, when he appeared with the Mongolian prime minister in
Beijing). Stretching more than 5,000 words, the joint statement
encapsulated a shared worldview between two authoritarian powers and two
autocratic leaders. The global order is undergoing "momentous changes,"
the statement read, which include a "transformation of the global
governance architecture and world order" and "global challenges and
threats growing from day to day." But perhaps more important, the joint
statement articulated a shared grievance that the United States and its
allies threaten Chinese and Russian interests and global aspirations.
NATO, the document states, promotes an "ideologized cold war approach,"
while the U.S. "Indo-Pacific strategy" endangers the "peace and
stability in the region." [Before Russia had even invaded Ukraine, then,
Beijing had come to see Moscow as a critical security and strategic
partner in the growing power rivalry with the United States and its
allies in Europe and Asia]{.underline}. More to the point, Russia is
China's only real military and strategic partner. Although tensions
exist in the bilateral relationship, not least because of the growing
economic gap between their economies, the broader geopolitical
chessboard draws Moscow and Beijing together. What's more, [Putin and Xi
have a close relationship --- they've met in person or virtually nearly
40 times in the decade that Xi has been in power. Time is running out
for China The war in Ukraine has undoubtedly thrown Beijing off balance,
and Chinese officials certainly didn't want Putin to invade in the first
place, but the basic math underlying this strategic partnership with
Moscow has not changed]{.underline}. Indeed, the war has only
consolidated Beijing's central logic for supporting Russia, given the
recent demonstration of Western diplomatic unity, the overwhelming power
of U.S.-led sanctions and the reinvigoration of NATO. The former editor
of the Chinese nationalist Global Times newspaper, Hu Xijin, argued in
recent commentary that ["if the U.S. pursues extreme strategic coercion
against China, with Russia as a partner, China will not fear a U.S.
energy blockade, our food supplies will be more secure, as will \[our
supplies\] of many other raw materials]{.underline}." In a speech last
weekend, China's vice foreign minister Le Yucheng drew a straight line
between NATO in Europe and China's own security concerns, warning that
just as Moscow's actions in Ukraine were a direct consequence of NATO
expansion, any actions by NATO in the Asia-Pacific region would provoke
similar consequences, and thus, the "crisis in Ukraine is a stern
warning." Beyond the substantive reasons underlying China's support for
Russia, there is also Beijing's unwillingness to be seen as submitting
to the U.S. demand that it back away from Moscow. As one Chinese Russia
expert at the Shanghai International Studies University observed, "If
China goes along with the U.S. against Russia, it will not only greatly
strengthen the anti-Russian camp, but will also be a huge boost to the
U.S. 'leadership.' " The key question now is just how far Beijing will
go to support Moscow. While Xi would like to maintain good relations
with Europe and avoid a further deterioration in the U.S.-China
relationship, [the fate of Putin and the Russian state directly
implicates China's core security interests.]{.underline} Not only would
the prospect of a beaten and broken Russia activate China's fears of
instability along their shared 2,500-mile border, but it would also
create uncertainty about the future leadership and geopolitical
orientation of the Russian government. If Putin were eventually to fall
from power, would his successor remain aligned with Beijing? So the more
anxious Beijing becomes about the war and Putin's personal position in
power, the more likely it is to step up support by providing direct
economic assistance, mitigating the impact of sanctions and even
supplying military equipment. Clearly, China's preference is to avoid
secondary sanctions in response to any support --- access to the
international market and the U.S. dollar remains critical for China's
economy and its continued rise. [But Beijing could pursue means of
support that are difficult to track, such as facilitating Russia's
access to U.S. dollars via offshore accounts, or by directing
state-owned enterprises and even private companies to increase their
purchases of non-sanctioned Russian goods and services]{.underline}. If
[China]{.underline} does decide to supply Russia with military
assistance, it [would likely seek to avoid equipment and hardware that
would flagrantly violate international law and sanctions or be easily
traceable, and instead provide spare parts, ammunition or certain
dual-use items that aren't yet sanctioned]{.underline}. But critically,
the decision to provide aid to Russia would be driven primarily by
Beijing's assessment of how Russia is faring in the war, rather than a
desire to avoid paying economic or diplomatic costs. Unfortunately, it
is difficult to imagine that Beijing is watching the conflict unfold
without growing more nervous by the day: Russia has failed to achieve
any of its major military or political objectives. In just the past
week, the Russian military has escalated its offensive to include a
wider number of indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets, and
President Biden is also now warning of "clear signs" that Putin is
considering using chemical weapons. Domestically, Putin has begun to
purge his inner circle, arresting some within the security services and
senior officials in the national guard. Beijing will see this as a sign
that Putin's grip is weakening, and as the sanctions continue to
decimate Russia's economy, anxiety in China is only likely to grow.
Succession plans protect nations. Putin and Xi just threw theirs out.
[Some analysts suggest that China may well see Russia's recent weakening
in the wake of sanctions as a net positive, as it shifts the balance of
power in the relationship in Beijing's favor]{.underline}. A tangible
benefit of such a shift would be Beijing's ability to demand more
favorable terms in buying Russian energy. While it's true that Beijing
leveraged Moscow's economic and diplomatic isolation after Russia
annexed Crimea in 2014 to gain better terms in several large energy
deals, the security environment for China in 2022 is far more
contentious than it was in 2014, and Moscow's true value is its
ideological orientation and military capabilities as much as its energy
stores. Xi does not want a weak Russia for a security and strategic
partner. If Beijing turns toward and not away from Moscow as the war
grinds on and the extent of human suffering increases, the basic
trajectory of [China's relations with the West will undergo a profound
shift toward open rivalry]{.underline}. It would be comforting to think
that [the prospect of such a disastrous turn would be enough to dissuade
the Chinese leadership from traveling down this path]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, though, [Beijing's geopolitical outlook for the next
decade]{.underline} --- much like Washington's --- [includes conflict
and friction as defining features.]{.underline}

### Russia-China Good Turn

#### Russia-Chinese alliance key to prevent border conflicts -- without dialogue, the tensions would mirror the sino-soviet border wars

**Crossley 2/27** \[Pamela Kyle Crossley - Collis Professor of History,
Dartmouth College, \"Are China and Russia Forging a New Ideological
Bloc?\",
https://www.chinafile.com/conversation/are-china-and-russia-forging-new-ideological-bloc,
DOA: 6/25/16\]

Ambassador Wu\'s reference to the absurdity of an \"ideological bloc\"
is interesting, and in the sense of "ideology" as sometimes used in
policy circles the prospect does seem absurd. [But there has been some
convergence of strategic conceptualization between the sequence of
governments based in Beijing and in Moscow since at least 1689, when
they began their own history of diplomatic exchange, and since that time
[they have successfully negotiated the maintenance of their nearly 3,000
miles of shared borders]{.mark}. It has not been simple or uniformly
peaceful, and the idea that two enormous countries sharing centuries of
successfully resolved tensions between their ancestral empires without
emerging with some common ideas about trade regulation and taxation,
environmental management, migration controls and maintenance of security
is not entirely credible]{.underline}. Those could amount to an ideology
of a positive sort, as contrasted to mere suspicion of and opposition to
the United States, a sort of negative ideology. There are clearly
grounds for alliance between Russia and China based on stable shared
perspectives and interests rather than only a shared opponent. The
question of China's dense population accumulation on one side of the
border and Russia's expanses of lightly inhabited and under-developed
territory on the other presents as many possibilities for cooperation as
for conflict. The same is true for the faltering of the regime in North
Korea, the problems of resource exploitation and transport in Central
Asia, the management of sea and air dominance of the western Pacific,
the development of programs for exploitation of space and the moon, and
financial and commercial initiatives in Europe, among other issues.
[[Russia and China have every reason to explore mutually-disciplined
expansion on all fronts at the expense,]{.mark} if possible, [of the
United States and Japan]{.mark}, and history suggests that the rewards
are great enough that both parties will have reason to accept such a
program**. [The possibility of disenchantment on either side will always
be present. Each can cite grievances against the other if needed, from
the First United Front to the Korean War to the Sino-Soviet split to
border disputes]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The greatest danger may come not
from the complexities of their roles in the wider world but from the
relative stabilities of their governments. Slippage by either would
raise the question of support from the other, or exploitation of a
crisis to in order to sponsor a new and perhaps dependent ---or at least
obliged--- new regime. [Their pasts, in other words, look a bit more
solid than their futures. [Where they seek friendship they could find
betrayal]{.mark}.]{.underline} But their history suggests that whether
empires or republics they have an underlying understanding of what it is
to be expansive on the Asian continent, to be enemies of Japan, and to
live in tension with whatever they mean by "the West." Why they would
need "ideology" to further consolidate their affinity is not clear, but
realization of what they have in common could be an ideology in itself.

#### Another sino-soviet border dispute causes nuclear war -- US gets drawn in when Russia or china attack each other

**Bolton 10** \[Kerry R Bolton, \"Sino-Soviet-US Relations and the 1969
Nuclear Threat\",
www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/05/17/sino-soviet-us-relations-and-the-1969-nuclear-threat/,
DOA: 6/25/16\]

[The mainstream press has just come out with a Chinese expose that has
informed an undoubtedly surprised world that in 1969 [the USSR wished to
settle its historical score with China and launch a nuclear
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. The USSR merely wanted an assurance of U.S.
neutrality. Far from the USA welcoming this de-clawing of the growing
dragon, it instead threatened that there would be retaliation from the
U.S. against Russia. According to a report first carried in the Daily
Telegraph, Chinese historian Liu Chenshan, writing in an officially
sanctioned newspaper, stated that the threat "came in 1969 at the height
of a bitter border dispute between Moscow and Beijing that left more
than one thousand people dead on both sides." \[1\] [Liu quotes Soviet
premier Alexei Kosygin as stating to Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev on
October 15 that "Washington has drawn up 'detailed plans' for a nuclear
war against the USSR if it attacked China."]{.underline} The Telegraph
writers also speculate that Liu is likely to have had access to official
archives given the appearance of this as part of a series of six
articles in an official news source. The Telegraph article continues:
"[[The historian claims that Washington saw the USSR as a greater threat
than China and wanted a strong China to counter-balance Soviet
power]{.mark}...]{.underline}" They also conclude: "Mr Liu, the author,
admits his version of history is likely to be contested by rival
scholars." However, this Chinese revelation is not "new" to informed
observers. [The Russian desire to settle with China, despite the
cynically named Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual
Assistance that had been signed between Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin in
1950 -- which relegated China to colonial status rather than pave the
way to super-power status\[2\] -- came amidst the culmination of border
disputes that had been ongoing since 1960.\[3]{.underline}\] The largest
conflict had taken place on March 2, 1969, when Chinese troops ambushed
Russian troops on the uninhabited Damansky Island in the Ussuri River,
killing 32 Russians. The Soviets responded on the night of March 14 by
shelling 20 kilometers into China. Approximately 60 Russians and 800
Chinese were killed in the conflict. So extensive was the Russian attack
that Mao feared a Soviet invasion. **[[It was then that the USSR
intended to drive home their offensive with a nuclear
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, in their
book Mao: The Unknown Story, allude to an article at the time published
in a London newspaper "by a KGB-linked Russian journalist Victor Louis",
who had been Russian emissary to Taiwan, stating that the Kremlin was
discussing bombing China's nuclear test site, and planning to set up an
"alterative leadership" for the Chinese Communist party.\[4\] Moreover
it was U.S. President Richard Nixon's aide John Haldeman who seems to
have first broken the nuclear attack story in his memoirs in 1978.\[5\]
He stated that for years the USSR had been trying to warn the USA not to
allow China to become a nuclear power. This claim by Haldeman seems to
directly contradict the claim by Liu that Nixon, when responding to the
1969 Soviet request for neutrality, did so not only because he regarded
China as a means of containing Russia, but also because he was still
"smarting from a Soviet refusal five years earlier to stage a joint
attack on China's nascent nuclear programme."\[6\] If we place this all
into context, I believe that the 1978 Haldeman version is more likely
than that of Liu's present contention. [If the USA had asked for support
from the USSR to bomb China's nuclear programme in 1964, this was a year
following Sino-Russian border conflicts amounting to 4000 dead. In 1960,
there had been 400 clashes; in 1962, 5000.\[]{.underline}7\] The USSR
would have no sentimental, comradely, ideological, diplomatic, or
geo-political reasons to oppose such a US proposal and then change her
mind five years later and make a similar suggestion to the USA. The
relationship between China, the USA, and the USSR is quite contrary to
how it is generally perceived. A more accurate scenario is that the USA
backed Mao and the USSR backed Chiang Kai-shek. Stalin, prior to Mao's
assumption to power, regarded him as a Trotskyite. While Stalin had
previously backed Mao as a counter to a Trotskyite coterie in China
headed by Prof. Chen Tu-hsiu, Mao's onetime mentor, by 1938,\[8\] Mao
was being denounced in the USSR as a Trotskyite.\[9\] During World War
II, while the USA was pushing Chiang to make an alliance with Mao
against the Japanese, Stalin was counselling Chiang against this.\[10\]
Gen. George Marshall warned Chiang in 1946 at a crucial time that if he
persisted in pursuing the beleaguered Red Army into Northern Manchuria,
U.S. aid would stop. This provided Mao with a base from which to
recuperate and finally defeat Chiang. On the other hand, Stalin's aid to
Mao was granted according to Russian interests as distinct from
communist fraternity, one particularly dramatic example of which was the
demand for repayment in food that resulted in 10,000 peasants dying of
starvation in Yenan.\[11\] This was a prelude to the debilitating
Sino-Soviet Treaty that was to result in the "Great Famine" for the same
reason.\[12\] Mao thought that he could make China a great power on
Stalin's coat tails. This was a grave error. While the USA attempted to
court China, Mao went out of his way to act "Bolshie" towards the "Paper
Tiger," in a futile effort to court Stalin. Chang and Halliday write:
"It was widely thought that it was the U.S. that refused to recognize
Mao's China. In fact, Mao went out of his way to make recognition
impossible by engaging in overtly hostile acts."\[13\] In 1979, the year
for the renewal of the 1950 "friendship treaty" between Russia and
China, Mao gestured as to what he by then thought the fraternal
relationship by invading Russia's ally Vietnam, which was particularly
significant in that in 1978 the USSR had entered into a 25 year defence
treaty with Vietnam.\[14\] [Given the historically strained (at best)
relationship between China and Russia, even at a time when they were
supposed to be ideologically aligned, what are likely future scenarios
on the world stage]{.underline}? There seems to be a preponderant view
that the USA and China will increasingly become rivals due to economical
and raw material factors. There is also a view that the USA and Russia
will align against China. Again turning to an article in the Daily
Telegraph, there is an interesting item from 2009. This refers to the
Russian ethnic population decline in the Russian Far East, in comparison
to the burgeoning Chinese population across the border, coupled with the
tremendous mineral resources of the area. David Blair writes: The
endless silver birch forests of the Russian Far East might appear so
desolate and windswept that no one could possibly be interested in them.
Yet the vast swath of territory between Lake Baikal and Vladivostok may
become a new theatre of confrontation between Russia and China in the
decades ahead. For now, the two giant neighbours have been thrust
together by their shared suspicion of America and they cooperate as
tactical allies, working in the United Nations Security Council to
contain Washington's power. But this affinity is based on little more
than having the same rival. [[The empty lands of the Russian Far
East]{.mark}, far closer to Beijing than Moscow, [contain major sources
of tension between the two powers]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### China has an incentive to attack the Russia border

**Sharavin 4** \[Alexander, director of the Political and Military
Analysis Institute, What the Papers Say, Jan 14\]

Question: In your view, who poses the greatest danger to Russia?
Alexander Sharavin: In the Defense Ministry\'s latest report, known as
the White Book, our likely opponents are not named - they remain
anonymous. [However, we believe in being specific. And we name China
first. At present, [China appears to have good neighborly relations with
Russia]{.mark}, and constantly declares that its intentions are
friendly; but some of its actual actions prompt the thought that not
everything is quite that simple]{.underline}. **[For example, [the state
borders issue hasn\'t been fully resolved - and such matters are always
time-bombs.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The Russian media pays a lot of
attention to the territory dispute with Japan over four small islands,
but it totally ignores China\'s pretensions, even though China aspires
to claim much more territory - virtually all of Siberia and the Russian
Far East. Or rather, official Beijing remains silent, but articles do
appear in China\'s newspapers sometimes, and discontented voices are
raised. It\'s hard to believe that anyone could permit themselves to
speak out like that without authorization in totalitarian China. I
repeat: [there is no threat from China in the short term - Beijing\'s
policies are entirely loyal in relation to us at present. But what might
happen ten years from now? What guarantee is there that somebody won\'t
try to play the territory card?]{.underline} Question: And we\'re
selling Beijing modern fighter jets with extra engines. Alexander
Sharavin: Yes, that\'s an alarming point. **[So it seems [China is
allowing for the possibility that the situation might change]{.mark},
and Russia might stop supplying spare parts for military hardware to its
neighbor? And is it any coincidence that [China\'s strongest military
forces are concentrated along our borders, even if they\'re at a
distance of 200 kilometers]{.mark}?]{.underline}** Is that any distance
at all, to them? And let\'s not forget that on our side of the border
there are regions with depressed economies, with vast natural resources
and small, ever-shrinking populations.

#### That causes extinction

**Sharavin 1** \[Alexander, Director of the Institute for Military and
Political Analysis, What the Papers Say, Oct 3\]

Now, a few words about the third type of war**[. [A real military threat
to Russia from China has not merely been ignored; it has been denied by
Russia\'s leaders and nearly all of the political
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Let\'s see some statistic figures at
first. The territory of Siberia and the Russian Far East comprises
12,765,900 square kilometers (75% of Russia\'s entire area), with a
population of 40,553,900 people (28% of Russia\'s population). The
territory of China is 9,597,000 square kilometers and its population is
1.265 billion (which is 29 times greater than the population of Siberia
and the Russian Far East). China\'s economy is among the fastest-growing
economies in the world. It remains socialistic in many aspects, i.e.
extensive and highly expensive, demanding more and more natural
resources. [China\'s natural resources are rather limited]{.underline},
whereas the depths of Siberia and the Russian Far East are almost
inexhaustible. Chinese propaganda has constantly been showing us
skyscrapers in free trade zones in southeastern China. [It should not be
forgotten, however, that some 250 to 300 million people live there, i.e.
at most a quarter of China\'s population.]{.underline} A billion Chinese
people are still living in misery. For them, even the living standards
of a backwater Russian town remain inaccessibly high. **[[They have
absolutely nothing to lose.]{.mark}]{.underline}** There is every
prerequisite for \"the final throw to the north.\" The strength of the
Chinese People\'s Liberation Army (CPLA) has been growing quicker than
the Chinese economy. A decade ago the CPLA was equipped with inferior
copies of Russian arms from late 1950s to the early 1960s. However,
through its own efforts Russia has nearly managed to liquidate its most
significant technological advantage. Thanks to our zeal, from antique
MiG-21 fighters of the earliest modifications and S-75 air defense
missile systems the Chinese antiaircraft defense forces have adopted
Su-27 fighters and S-300 air defense missile systems. China\'s air
defense forces have received Tor systems instead of anti-aircraft guns
which could have been used during World War II. The shock air force of
our \"eastern brethren\" will in the near future replace antique Tu-16
and Il-28 airplanes with Su-30 fighters, which are not yet available to
the Russian Armed Forces! [Russia may face the \"wonderful\" prospect of
combating [the Chinese army]{.mark}, which, if full mobilization is
called, is comparable in size with Russia\'s entire population, **[which
also has nuclear weapons]{.mark}** (even tactical weapons become
strategic if states have common borders) **[and would be absolutely
insensitive to losses]{.mark}** (even a loss of a few million of the
servicemen would be acceptable for China).]{.underline} **[[Such a war
would be more horrible than the World War II.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It
would require from our state maximal tension, universal mobilization and
complete accumulation of the army military hardware, up to the last tank
or a plane, in a single direction (we would have to forget such
\"trifles\" like Talebs and Basaev, but this does not guarantee success
either). [[Massive nuclear strikes on basic military forces and cities
of China would finally be the only way out]{.mark}, what would exhaust
Russia\'s armament completely. We have not got another set of
intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-based missiles,
whereas the general forces would be extremely exhausted in the border
combats]{.underline}. In the long run, even if the aggression would be
stopped after the majority of the Chinese are killed, **[[our country
would be absolutely unprotected against the \"Chechen\" and the
\"Balkan\" variants both, and even against the first frost of a possible
nuclear winter]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
