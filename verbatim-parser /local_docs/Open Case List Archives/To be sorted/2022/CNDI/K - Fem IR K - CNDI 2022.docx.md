#### Security cooperation with NATO enforces global hegemonic masculinity through recreation of military masculinities and imperial violence

**Wright 22**

University, UK. "Challenging civil society perceptions of NATO: Engaging
the Women, Peace and Security agenda." Cooperation and Conflict. April
2022. Pg 3-4. LJS

[NATO is a political-military alliance built on consensus
decision-making. Moving beyond its Cold War origins, the alliance's
remit has expanded significantly beyond a sole focus on collective
defence to include crisis management and cooperative
security.]{.underline} This has seen NATO's focus enlarge from a
regional one to a global one, with recent engagements in Afghanistan,
Libya and Kosovo, for example. Its status as a multilateral institution
means it is limited by its members' priorities and therefore sensitive
not to implicate NATO or NATO member states in wrongdoing (Hebert,
2012). In centring NATO as an 'institution of international hegemonic
masculinity' (Wright et al., 2019), in this analysis, it is possible to
shed light on the peculiarities of NATO's WPS work to date, against
which engagement with civil society takes place. [This has two
co-constituting elements, first, internally, existing gender norms and
expectations of masculinity and femininity reflective of a hierarchical
military institution are (re)created and (re)enforced through NATO's
engagement with WPS (Wright et al., 2019: 71). For example, men working
on WPS at NATO navigate both the trivialisation and the feminisation of
such work and must (re)negotiate their own identities. Yet in so doing
they reinforce the importance of men speaking to and listening to other
men (rather than women) reinforcing the gendered status quo (Wright et
al., 2019: 93; see also Hurley, 2018a). Second, externally, as a
transnational military alliance, NATO acts as a 'teaching machine' in
which member and partner states learn the value of WPS as a 'military
tool' through socialisation with each other (Wright et al., 2019; see
also Enloe, 1981). This means perpetuating an understanding of WPS as a
means to support operational effectiveness through 'the role of
masculinist protector which reinforces hegemonic4 Cooperation and
Conflict 00(0) militaristic, masculine ideals and norms' (Wright et al.,
2019: 34). This patriarchal logic puts 'women and children, in a
subordinate position of dependence and obedience' to justify the waging
of war (Young, 2003: 2), for example, NATO's intervention in Afghanistan
(Wright, 2019).]{.underline} It is reinforced through the stories NATO
tells internally about its WPS engagement (Hurley, 2018b) and externally
in public diplomacy (Wright, 2019) and to support partnerships with
other states but also celebrities (Wright and Bergman Rosamond, 2021)
and now civil society. [Thus, interrogating civil society perceptions of
NATO in this context adds an additional dimension to understanding how
NATO seeks to legitimise itself as a WPS actor, further constituting its
role as an institution of international hegemonic
masculinity.]{.underline}

#### This androcentric world order makes extinction inevitable---war and environmental degradation

**Nhanenge 2007** \[Jytte Masters @ U South Africa, paper submitted in
part fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of master of arts in
the subject Development Studies, "ECOFEMINSM: TOWARDS INTEGRATING THE
CONCERNS OF WOMEN, POOR PEOPLE AND NATURE INTO DEVELOPMENT"\]

The [androcentric premises also have political
consequences]{.underline}. They protect the ideological basis of
exploitative relationships. [Militarism, colonialism, racism, sexism,
capitalism and other pathological 'isms' of modernity get legitimacy
from the assumption that power relations and hierarchy are inevitably a
part of human society, due to man\'s inherent nature]{.underline}.
Because when mankind by nature is autonomous, competitive and violent
(i.e. masculine) then coercion and [hierarchical structures are
necessary to manage conflicts and maintain social order]{.underline}. In
this way, the cooperative relationships such as those found among some
women and tribal cultures, are by a dualised definition unrealistic and
utopian. (Birkeland 1995: 59). This means that power relations are
generated by universal scientific truths about human nature, rather than
by political and social debate. The consequence is that people cannot
challenge the basis of the power structure because they believe it is
the scientific truth, so it cannot be otherwise. In this way, militarism
[is justified as being unavoidable, regardless of its patent
irrationality. Likewise, if the scientific \"truth\" were that humans
would always compete for a greater share of resources, then the rational
response to the environmental crisis would seem to be \"dog-eat-dog\"
survivalism. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which nature and
community simply cannot survive]{.underline}. (Birkeland 1995: 59). This
type of social and political power structure is kept in place by social
policies. It is based on the assumption that if the scientific method is
applied to public policy then social planning can be done free from
normative values. However, according to Habermas (Reitzes 1993: 40) the
scientific method only conceal pre-existing, unreflected social
interests and pre-scientific decisions. Consequently, also [social
scientists]{.underline} apply the scientific characteristics of
objectivity, value-freedom, rationality and quantifiability to social
life. In this way, they [assume they can unveil universal laws about
social relations, which will lead to true knowledge]{.underline}. Based
on this, correct social policies can be formulated. Thus, [social
processes are excluded, while scientific objective facts are
included]{.underline}. Society is assumed a static entity, where no
changes are possible. By promoting a permanent character, social science
legitimizes the existing social order, while obscuring the relations of
domination and subordination, which is keeping the existing power
relations inaccessible to analysis. The frozen order also makes it
impossible to develop alternative explanations about social reality. It
prevents a historical and political understanding of reality and denies
the possibility for social transformation by human agency. The
prevailing condition is seen as an unavoidable fact. [This implies that
human beings are passive and that domination is a natural force, for
which no one is responsible]{.underline}. This permits the state freely
to implement laws and policies, which are controlling and coercive.
These are seen as being correct, because they are based on scientific
facts made by scientific experts. [One result is that the state, without
consulting the public, engages in a pathological pursuit of economic
growth.]{.underline} Technology can be used to dominate societies or to
enhance them. Thus both science and technology could have developed in a
different direction. But [due to patriarchal values infiltrated in
science the type of technology developed is meant to dominate, oppress,
exploit and kill]{.underline}. One reason is that patriarchal [societies
identify masculinity with conquest]{.underline}. Thus [any technical
innovation will continue to be a tool for more effective oppression and
exploitation]{.underline}. [The highest priority seems to be given to
technology that destroys life]{.underline}. Modern societies are
dominated by masculine institutions and [patriarchal
ideologies]{.underline}. [Their technologies prevailed in Auschwitz,
Dresden, Hiroshima]{.underline}, Nagasaki, Vietnam, Iran, Iraq, [and
Afghanistan and in many other parts of the world. Patriarchal power has
brought us acid rain, global warming, military states, poverty and
countless cases of suffering.]{.underline} We have seen men whose power
has caused them to lose all sense of reality, decency and imagination,
and we must fear such power. [The ultimate result of unchecked
patriarchy will be ecological catastrophe and nuclear
holocaust]{.underline}. Such actions are denial of wisdom. [It
is]{.underline} working against natural harmony and [destroying the
basis of existence]{.underline}. But [as long as ordinary people leave
questions of technology to the \"experts" we will continue the forward
stampede. As long as economics focus on technology and both are the
focus of politics, we can leave none of them to experts]{.underline}.
Ordinary people are often more capable of taking a wider and more
humanistic view than these experts. (Kelly 1990: 112-114; Eisler 1990:
3233; Schumacher 1993: 20, 126, 128, 130).

#### Prioritize a Feminist Security Studies approach to IR -- gender analysis represents a crucial and central aspect of conceptualizing war and requires a complete overhaul of how we normatively view IR

**Sjoberg 13**

Sjoberg, British Academy Global Professor of Politics and International
Relations at Royal Holloway University of London. "The (Genderless)
Study of War in International Relations," Gendering Global Conflict:
Toward a Feminist Theory of War, Columbia University Press, 2013.

What **[war theorizing shares]{.underline}** is a lack of, and **[a lack
of commitment to, gender analysis.]{.underline}** [This is,]{.underline}
of course, [a broad and sweeping generalization that is more accurate
and applicable to some theorists]{.underline} and paradigms [than
others, but is generally fair when applied to war
studies.]{.underline}320 For example, **[between 1945 and 2006, the five
highest-ranked security journals published]{.underline}** articles with
**[gender analysis in]{.underline}** them in **[less than one-quarter of
1 percent of their content.]{.underline}**321 Much of the
**[ground-breaking work in critical security studies mentions gender
marginally, if at all]{.underline}**, and generally fails to adopt
gender analysis into its work.322 [In Levy and Thompson's
recent]{.underline} (otherwise excellent) [book summarizing war
theorizing, "gender" makes an appearance
twice]{.underline}---**[in]{.underline}** two
**[footnotes.]{.underline}**323 [The first one problematizes the
"over-aggregation" of human nature]{.underline} in first-image analyses
of war, [given that they treat "the male and female as indistinguishable
and neglect any possible impact of gender]{.underline} on the causes of
war."324 [The second discusses "demographic trends" such as "surpluses
of men" and "youth bulges"]{.underline} as causes of war.325 **[Neither
do serious gender analysis]{.underline}** in the terms this book intends
to engage. [This is not to say that mainstream war studies has never
paid any attention to gender, or]{.underline} that [gender has been
completely absent]{.underline} from critical theorists' work on war and
conflict. [It is]{.underline}, instead, [to make two
distinct]{.underline} (and hopefully more modest) [claims.]{.underline}
The first is that, **[to the extent that gender has been taken up in war
theorizing, it remains peripheral and has not become]{.underline}** a
**[central]{.underline}** part of research programs **[outside feminist
security studies considering the nature, constitution, causes, and
consequences of war(s).]{.underline}**326 The second is that, **[to the
extent]{.underline}** that mainstream **[studies of war have considered
gender, they have actually been largely talking about a]{.underline}**
partial and **[limited idea of gender that involves women as a
biological sex being imbued with characteristics gendered
feminine]{.underline}** for the purpose of analyzing war.327 This second
claim will be discussed in more detail in chapter 2, when I lay out this
book's feminist approaches to studying war ontologically,
epistemologically, and methodologically. For now, it is the first
claim---that **[gender theorizing remains absent from]{.underline}**
(and when not absent from, marginal to) **[both mainstream and critical
war theorizing]{.underline}**---that lays the foundation for this book's
work. In the remainder of the text, [I seek to analyze and problematize
"genderless" war studies. In calling war studies genderless, I am not
implying that it is somehow gender neutral or without gender
implications.]{.underline} Quite the opposite, I am arguing that **[it
is impossible to think about war well without gender
analysis]{.underline}** and that **[doing so obscures the empirical
operation of and normative consequences of gender in]{.underline}** the
nature, causes, performances of, and consequences of
**[war(s).]{.underline}** **[Gender is necessary,
conceptually]{.underline}**, to understanding the nature of war(s);
**[empirically]{.underline}**, to understanding wars' causes and
consequences; **[ethically]{.underline}**, to understanding its
implications; **[and prescriptively, to understanding how to stop
wars.]{.underline}** [Gender does "analytical and normative work" and
serves as a "resource for thought"]{.underline} in almost every aspect
of how we fight wars and how we read them.328 [War, wars, and the study
of both are fundamentally]{.underline} (if not unalterably)
[gendered]{.underline} and, therefore, **[feminist theorizing about war
is not only a part of, but a crucial piece of, the war
puzzle.]{.underline}**329 Feminist theory "raises the question of [what
kind of politics and theory would be possible without the work
accomplished by gendered logics]{.underline}" in war theorizing.330
Also, [when I call war studies genderless, I am not arguing that the
work I outlined]{.underline} in this chapter [does not have a
relationship with gender theorizing]{.underline}---I am arguing that
**[its relationship is (normatively and empirically) negative,
problematic, and untenable.]{.underline}** These **[relationships
between gender theorizing and security or war studies
have]{.underline}** variously **[been called
"impossible,"]{.underline}**331 **["awkward,"]{.underline}**332
**["uneasy"]{.underline}**333 **["limited,"]{.underline}**334 **[and
akin to "exile."]{.underline}**335 [While]{.underline} (many in)
[IR]{.underline} generally [and security studies]{.underline}
specifically have [conceded that feminist scholarship may exist at the
margins]{.underline}, **[gender analysis "does not simply 'add' gender
to an unchanged object of study, but]{.underline}** . . . **[force\[s\]
a]{.underline}** more **[radical rethinking of what properly constitutes
I/international R/relations]{.underline}** to begin with, transforming
the boundaries and conceptual basis."336 This work starts with the
feminist analysis of and deconstruction of war theorizing. **[It
requires showing the gendered nature of that theorizing]{.underline}**,
of the meaning, causes, and consequences of war(s) at each level of
analysis. The logics, tools, and insights of the approaches to war(s) in
this chapter will be used, melded, critiqued, reformulated, called out,
and engaged throughout the rest of this book's theorizing of war through
feminist lenses. **[Engaging the genderless study of war
is]{.underline}** a **[crucial]{.underline}** part of the project of
feminist war theorizing, because, as Kimberly Hutchings argues, "one can
hope . . . **[to loosen the hold of masculinity on meaning and
life]{.underline}** only once one has first appreciated how much work is
accomplished by masculinity's logical structure."337 [Chapter 2
introduces the feminist theory tools to begin to see, and deconstruct,
the influence of masculinity's logical structures on war
theorizing.]{.underline}

### China

#### The 1AC's portrayal of China as an aggressive masculine threat serves as a reductionist view of Chinese culture to justify U.S. "Just Warrior" saviorism

**Sjoberg 10**

Sjoberg, British Academy Global Professor of Politics and International
Relations at Royal Holloway University of London. "Gendering Power
Transition Theory," Gender and International Security: Feminist
Perspectives. 2010.

**[Power transition theorists found that "occupation of a high position
in the international hierarchy is associated with war]{.underline}**
involvement, [irrespective of other attributes (ideology,
etc.)]{.underline} of the state occupying that position."88 Even if
those states at the top of the international hierarchy are more likely
to be involved in wars,89 **[feminists question the
assumption]{.underline}** that this is **[because nations with the
capacity to fight wars are necessarily more likely to
fight.]{.underline}** Feminist reformulation (R1) (see Table 5.1) posits
that [the content and salience of a state's hegemonic masculinity
will]{.underline} be a [factor in its bellicosity.]{.underline} The
feminist argument is that **[the more competitive a state's hegemonic
masculinity, the more likely that state is to make war]{.underline}**;
this risk is compounded by high salience. [In World War II Germany, a
competitive form of masculinity was very salient.]{.underline} George
[Mosse's study of the ideal German man]{.underline}90 in the 1930s
[reveals him as: Tall and muscular]{.underline}, he has no fat on his
body and no hair anywhere but on his head. His broad, contoured
shoulders narrow to a thin waist. He has [a fine colorless chiseled
face]{.underline} with a strong prominent square jaw. He is **[the
flawless man ...]{.underline}** , **[not only did he
embody]{.underline}** the older **[aristocratic values]{.underline}** of
bravery, courage, and chivalry, **[but]{.underline}** mirroring
bourgeois values, **[he was also disciplined, orderly, and
restrained]{.underline}** ... The perfect man, therefore, was
**[committed to sacrifice and heroism]{.underline}**, in other words,
[soldierly values that put the nation ahead of the
individual.]{.underline}91 This German **[masculinity "increasingly came
to be linked to ideas about nationalism."]{.underline}**92 This idea of
[masculinity became increasingly salient as "the nationalist press often
portrayed Jewish men as]{.underline} the exact [opposite of the manly
ideal in looks and behavior]{.underline} ... jittery, restless, greedy,
selfish, and ... ugly---nearly deformed."93 In the 1930s, "**[German
fascists ... took the notion of masculinity to its]{.underline}** awful,
ghastly, and seemingly logical **[extreme.]{.underline}**"94 Perhaps
[this can be contrasted with the case of a rising China.]{.underline}
Kam Louie, a scholar of Chinese masculinities, explains that while
"**[Western stereotypes of the 'real man' have described the Occidental
male]{.underline}** as forming his notion of male-self within images of
toughness, courageousness, and decisiveness, ... **[in the Chinese case,
the cerebral male model tends to dominate the macho, brawny
male.]{.underline}**"95 **[The Communist Revolution in China has further
demilitarized Chinese masculinity]{.underline}**,96 since, while "[the
core meaning of wen-wu]{.underline}97 [still revolves around cultural
attainment and martial valour]{.underline} ... \[ideal-types of
masculinity have been shaped by\] [Communist insistence that able-bodied
citizens work]{.underline} \[which\] ... has [generated idealized images
of workers and peasants" rather than soldiers.]{.underline}98 Louie
suggests that the **[current Chinese hegemonic masculinity is less
aggressive and militaristic, and]{.underline}** that it is both **[more
open and less salient]{.underline}** now than it has been previously.99
Given these two examples, [the feminist reformulation]{.underline} (R1)
[would expect bellicosity from 1930s Germany rather than contemporary
China.]{.underline} The same **[empirical evidence that PTT
uses]{.underline}** could instead **[support a feminist
argument]{.underline}** that Germany's level of interest in aggressive
masculinity made Germany a belligerent state, and that **[a dissatisfied
China would have less interest in war than the 1930s
Germany.]{.underline}** A feminist reinterpretation would expect that
[Germans' hypercompetitive hegemonic masculinity in the 1930s would
motivate]{.underline} German [leaders and citizens to try to subordinate
other masculinities]{.underline}, while **[the Chinese government,
following]{.underline}** their more **[cerebral hegemonic masculinity,
would place less priority on competition with other
states.]{.underline}**

### Continuum of Violence

#### The 1AC's focus on violence as the event of war recreates everyday forms of violence

**Wibben 19**

Annick T.R., Professor of Gender, Peace & Security at the Swedish
Defence University. "Everyday Security, Feminism, and the Continuum of
Violence." Journal of Global Security Studies. 2019. LJS

Innovative work on global security issues comes not just from different
traditions within security studies (global or not), but by talking
across fields of study. This might include engaging peace and conflict
studies, geography, anthropology, and more. Feminist security studies
(FSS) is a case in point: whereas it is often read as a subfield or
particular approach within security studies, it was certainly not
conceived as such since "feminist aims and the scope of their concerns
explodes its confines at every possible turn" (Wibben 2011, 113; see
also Sjoberg and Lobasz 2011; Shepherd 2013; Elias and Roberts 2015;
Chisholm and Stachowitsch 2017). From the outset of feminist engagements
with global politics, security issues were a key concern---whether in
the 1980s when feminist international relations (IR) scholars began to
make their mark on the field (see Wibben 2017 for an overview of FSS) or
in their much earlier engagements in attempt to first prevent World War
I and, later, to mitigate its effects (see, e.g., Confortini 2012; Owens
2018; Tickner and True 2018). [Feminist scholars would maintain that
gendered (security) relations, while instantiated differently across the
globe and over time, could fulfill Jon Western's (2016, 100) litmus test
for being both global in scale, "worldwide in either cause or effect,"
and global in reach, though "their impact is usually local or regional."
Hence, traditional security scholars ignore gender relations and
feminist scholarship and uncover their role in relation to security
studies at their own peril---traditional security scholars are, as
Cynthia Enloe (e.g., 2015) would formulate it, not being particularly
realistic. Paying attention to gendered (security) relations often
involves moving beyond states, even as state practices are also deeply
gendered (Peterson 1992; Parashar, Tickner, and True 2018).]{.underline}
Consequently, the space provided by journals such as JoGSS is crucial to
push the conversation forward. Of course, many critical security
scholars have long questioned the state as the primary referent object
of security studies: debates about broadening and deepening security in
the 1990s (see, e.g., Lipschutz 1995; Krause and Williams 1997) opened
up conversations about the study of security as fundamentally a
political project (Wibben 2016a), thus making room for scholars to look
not just at individual and human security, but everyday and vernacular
security as well (VaughanWilliams and Stevens 2016; see also Benzig,
this issue). At the same time, feminist scholars in a variety of
disciplinary traditions also increasingly started to frame their
conversations about peace, violence, and the war system in terms of
security (e.g., Tickner 1992; Reardon 1993). Noting that, "until women
have control over their own security, a truly comprehensive system of
security cannot be devised" (Tickner 1992, 30), feminist scholars tend
to pay close attention to the impact of security policies on the
everyday lives of people (see, e.g., Sylvester, 2011, 2013; Wibben
2016b; Gentry, Shepherd, and Sjoberg 2018; Ní Aoláin et al. 2018).
[Departing from a large part of traditional security studies research,
feminist scholars challenge common sense notions that wars are fought to
protect vulnerable populations and show that civilians are, especially
in ethno-nationalist wars, explicitly targeted (Enloe 1998; Hansen 2000,
2001, 2006; Carpenter 2005; McLeod 2016). Rather than offering security
for all their citizens, states may threaten their own populations
through direct or structural violence reflected in war-fighting
priorities embedded in a variety of state institutions (Reardon 1985;
Peterson 1992; Tickner 1992; Enloe 1993, 2000; Young 2003). Feminists
contribute to debates about the increasing import of sophisticated
technologies into the practice of war, from nuclear strategy to drones,
which asserts that it depersonalizes killing, offers the illusion of
clean warfare, and obscures accountability]{.underline} (Cohn 1987;
Masters 2005; Wilcox 2015; Bayard de Volo 2016; Clark 2018). Some
scholars also directly engage traditional theories of security (Sjoberg
2010, 2013; Wibben 2011; Detraz 2012) and security policy (Stachowitsch
2012; MacKenzie 2015). An ever-increasing amount of research looks at
the impact of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and subsequent
resolutions (Shepherd 2008; Gizelis and Olsson 2015; McLeod 2016), as
well as efforts to address sexualized violence in war (Eriksson Baaz and
Stern 2013; Cohen 2016). Other scholars have made important
contributions to the study of private military companies from a feminist
perspective (Stachowitsch 2012; Eichler 2015). While many traditional
sciences assume gender neutrality, feminists make gender, that is, the
socially constructed femininity/masculinity distinction that shapes our
perception of, and response to, the world, a central category of
analysis. They are concerned, above all, with gendered power relations
and also note how they are molded by intersecting axes of oppression
(Collins 2000). [Consequently, feminist scholars argue that concepts and
ideas about security, as well as security practices and institutions,
are shaped by gender: gender (along with class, caste, race, sexuality
and more) structures the hierarchies that dictate what and who is taken
seriously. To analyze these power relations, feminist security studies
"includes approaches, for instance, that pay attention to the workings
of gender in order to ask questions about security; it also includes
scholarship that refuses any line of distinction that separates
'security' from the workings of gender"]{.underline} (Stern and Wibben
2014, 2). Journals such as the International Feminist Journal of
Politics and Security Dialogue as well as, more recently, Critical
Military Studies and Critical Studies on Security have published
excellent work in this area, which should be included in more global
security syllabi. This past year brought us two new handbooks on gender
and conflict/security (Gentry, Shepherd, and Sjoberg 2018; Ní Aolaín et
al. 2018), joining previous efforts to provide an overview of the field
(e.g., Detraz 2012). [A key theoretical contribution feminist peace and
conflict studies scholars have made to feminist understandings of
security is the notion of a continuum of violence between peace and
wartime that also transgresses the boundaries of private/public and
international/domestic realms (see, e.g., Moser 2001; Cockburn 2004).
Violence against women, as feminist scholars have pointed out with
increasing frequency, is part of a multidimensional continuum of
violence (Cockburn 2004; see also O'Rourke 2013; Pratt and
Richter--Devroe 2014) that "extends from violence in the home, to the
structural violence of poverty, to the ecological violence associated
with the depletion of our planetary resources and natural disasters, to
the violence of war and its aftermath" (True 2012, 5; see also Tickner
2001). Working with these notions, and paying attention to gendered (and
intersecting) power hierarchies, has allowed feminist scholars to note
important continuities from the pre- through the postwar
environment]{.underline} (Jacobs, Jacobsen, and Marchbank 2000;
Meintjes, Pillay, and Turshen 2001; Moser and Clark 2001; Giles and
Hyndman 2004; Cohn 2013). For example, as Henshaw also notes in this
issue, existing societal expectations about gender roles shape not only
women's positions during wartime, but also significantly mold war's
aftermaths. Importantly, while there are always conflicting notions of
femininity, the way in which gender roles (for women, men and trans\*,
given that gender is a relational category where changes always affect
the full spectrum) change during and after wars is not straightforward.
[While the disruption of violent conflict offers new openings, for
example, for women to take on roles as combatants or new positions in
the formal economy, it simultaneously can lead to greater scrutiny of
their activities, such as their sexual relations (Sylvester 1993;
Pettman 1996; Ahäll 2015 ˚ ; Gentry and Sjoberg 2015). Literature is
accumulating regarding women's participation in fighting forces (e.g.,
Stiehm 1996; Alison 2009; MacKenzie 2012; Sylvester 2013; Parashar 2014;
Gentry and Sjoberg 2015; Henshaw 2017; Vastapuu 2018), which provides
manifold insights into the ways in which these venues of participation
in war are shaped not just by gendered expectations, which influence
whether women take on only support or also combat roles, but also by
age, race, class, indigeneity, and more.]{.underline} Leena Vastapuu's
(2018) study of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR)
processes in Liberia is a case in point: she examined how young women,
who were fairly empowered during their time in the fighting forces
despite their often traumatic entry into this life, found the aftermath
difficult to navigate. [Paying attention not just to gender, but also to
social status (class) and differences in rural and urban locations,
provides for greater insight into everyday (in)securities and the need
to account for these in interventions by the international
community.]{.underline} What we learn from Vastapuu (2018), and what
other scholars have also described (MacKenzie 2012; Mazurana and Cole
2013; Basini 2016; Mazurana, Krystalli, and Baaré 2018; Henshaw, this
issue), is that peace negotiations and settlements that structure war's
aftermaths leave much to be desired when examined from a feminist
perspective. [Crucially, a focus on armed actors in violent conflicts
often exclude women from the negotiating table to begin with. What is
more, if little attention is paid to gender and its intersections with
class or race, "peace" tends to imply a "return" to prewar societal
relations (which can reinforce societal exclusion as Benzig notes in
this issue), or, worse, it may institute new fundamentalisms. This
postwar gender anxiety, as Henshaw (this issue) calls it, can have dire
consequences for women who took on varied new roles during the violent
conflict. At the same time, it has proven impossible to put the genie
back in the bottle in its entirety, so to speak: many women will refuse
to return to their old roles in postwar societies]{.underline} (Berry
and Rana 2019). Indeed, permanent shifts in societal norms can be
expected. [Paying attention to these conflicts at the everyday,
microlevel is important to understand complex contemporary global
phenomena such as the ability of extremist movements to recruit young
men to enact violence as a way of (re)asserting their masculinity in the
face of (perceived or actual) threats to their traditional
livelihoods]{.underline} (Parpart and Zalewski 2008; Kimmel 2018).
Deeply contextual historical case studies by area experts, which are a
traditional strength of feminist scholarship, are needed to most
accurately assess specific security environments, as Emy Matesan (this
issue) shows in relation to Islamist movements (for a feminist take, see
Brown 2011, 2018; Eggert 2016). This kind of research requires the
inclusion and, indeed, promotion of a variety of methods (see also Fiona
Adamson, this issue) to capture the experiences of people from all walks
of life in order to name, as well as challenge, the long colonial
histories of their grievances (Chowdry and Nair 2004; Agathangelou and
Ling 2009; Tuhiwai-Smith 2012; Rutazibwa 2016). Using innovative methods
like autophotography (Vastapuu 2018), narrative analysis (Wibben 2011;
Shepherd 2012; Mehta and Wibben 2018), or poetic reimaginings (Sylvester
1993; Zalewski 2013; Ling 2014) should become as much part of the
toolbox of global security scholars as survey research or experimental
methods. What is more, being curious about what has heretofore been
taken for granted and also being willing to be surprised, as Cynthia
Enloe (2004) urges, can lead to the production of new knowledges, as
Bettina Benzig (this issue) finds when challenging overly optimistic
assessments of vernacular security. Similarly, studying sexualized
violence in the Congo, Maria Eriksson Baaz and Maria Stern (2013)
developed a "methodology of unease" when "little was as we had
(unwittingly?) expected it to be, and the unease that ensued from then
on served as our methodological guide and compass"(Eriksson Baaz and
Stern 2016, 124).

[Over and above the specific context of cybersecurity, technology design
is gendered: it misunderstands, omits and consolidates certain gendered
uses, it privileges perceived masculine practices over feminine ones,
and it stereotypes femininity in problematic ways.25 These gendered
aspects have direct impact on cybersecurity]{.underline}. Many
technology designers are aware of the gendered implications of their
work, and there are entire subdisciplines, including user experience and
user-centred design, that seek to improve technology design along
gendered lines.26 The following are select examples of gendered
technology design: » Virtual reality prototypes have, like many
technologies, omitted women almost entirely as their intended users.27 »
The choice of women voice assistants for phones, smart speakers and
devices, and satellite navigation has been shown to reinforce harmful
assumptions about gendered power relationships.28 » The design of
technologies directly marketed to women, known as "femvertizing", often
"prey\[s\] on women's assumptive need to correct problematic behaviors
or unacceptable physical deviancies".29 Gendered assumptions about what
is "normal" are deployed in advertising material to encourage women to
purchase products that enable them to conform or minimize "abnormal"
physical and personal characteristics. » There are gendered differences
in academic and industry research on technology, as in other fields,
including in citation practices.30 These broader gendered aspects of
technology design influence cybersecurity in several ways. [Most
basically, the conception of cybersecurity employed in technological
design is gendered. For example, the design of smart household devices
has not adequately included intimate partner violence in the "threat
modelling" phase of design, meaning that supposedly secure smart devices
increase gendered risks.31]{.underline} Even services designed to
prevent this problem, such as online resources about leaving abusive
relationships, can themselves be a risk to individuals if the abuser
discovers the tool. Therefore, the designers of such tools -- such as
emergency "exit" buttons on the websites of victim organizations -- have
to take these risks into account in their threat models.32 To reduce the
occurrence of these inadvertently dangerous blind spots, it is thus
important that the design and threat-modelling processes include diverse
perspectives and people from minoritized groups.33 [Another example can
be found in contemporary cybersecurity measures aimed at protecting
individuals from privacy breaches or identity theft, which rely on the
use of personal information as the backup for passwords and online
account access. These assume that the "bad actor" is a stranger without
other access to the middle name of a parent or the name of a first pet
-- an assumption not met in instances of intimate partner and family
violence.34]{.underline} The design of online identity-verification
procedures thus has gendered effects due to the conception of "threat"
they employ (and, in this case, omit). [The burden of cybersecurity work
is also gendered. Privacy settings on social media are more likely to be
activated by women, especially for images.35]{.underline} Women are
expected to exercise near-total control over their own digital footprint
(such as changing passwords and deleting social media accounts, etc.) in
order to reduce their vulnerability to digital coercive control.36
[Failing to act as a perfect digital user -- due to a lack of time or
literacy, or a reliance on technology for support and social connections
-- becomes a source of victim-blaming.37]{.underline} There is also a
trade-off here between different cybersecurity goals: permitting
companies to design applications that access location and other data can
be a way of preventing other privacy threats, even though the companies
use this data commercially, which can itself be a threat. [Finally, the
advertising of cybersecurity technologies is gendered. Software that can
remotely monitor phones and other devices is marketed as designed for
child protection, enabling families to track the movements of their
children online.38 But this software is also used in situations of
intimate partner violence (and is often termed
"stalkerware").39]{.underline} Google has banned all advertising of
stalkerware to combat this dual-use problem.40 [Overall, cybersecurity
design inherits the gendered omissions, biases and reinforcement of
gendered assumptions that are evident in technology design. The threat
models, reporting and user-control procedures, and advertising of
cybersecurity technologies mean that women (or the most vulnerable
gender groups in a particular context) are more likely to have
cybersecurity threats downplayed or omitted; more likely to have
additional security burdens; and more likely to be affected by
disingenuous cybersecurity advertising.]{.underline}

#### The field of cybersecurity reinforces patriarchal norms through threat construction and constraints within the industry

[How we think about defence -- that is, what it means to defend and the
common-sense actions we take to defend -- is gendered. It reflects a
series of norms associated with masculinity (e.g. protection, technical
competence, autonomy, etc.) that derive from military understandings of
national security.63]{.underline} This is often positive since it makes
cybersecurity intelligible for a wide range of non-experts through the
use of parallel concepts and language. [It can also, however, have
negative effects. Many of the challenges associated with gender and
cybersecurity defence derive from a mismatch between conventional
understandings of national defence and cybersecurity, which is premised
upon mitigating and managing, rather than eliminating, risks. Masculine
norms and expectations that relate to using force to produce physical
safety, for instance, may lead policy makers to downplay nonphysical
harms in cybersecurity.64]{.underline} Masculine gender norms around
vulnerability can make admitting error, seeking help or working
cooperatively more difficult.65 [This can lead to reluctance to actively
pursue cybersecurity defence or to be adequate transparent about
failures to clients, employees or citizens. Such norms can also lead to
the prioritization of some individuals and organizations -- often those
seen as socially prestigious or valuable for defence and protection
(such as the State, the military or large corporations) -- over others
(such as civil society organizations and individuals, notably women and
LGBTQ+66 people).67]{.underline} A full gender perspective on
cybersecurity defence recognizes that civil society and groups
representing women and LGBTQ+ people have a need for, and a right to,
cybersecurity defence -- including the State resources (in terms of
capacity-building, expertise and enforcement) needed to provide it. More
specifically, different elements of cybersecurity defence raise separate
gender issues. Threats need to be monitored through the continuous
evaluation and analysis of networks, infrastructure and devices for
potential intrusions or deliberate disruption.68 [Following from this,
at a basic level, what is considered to be a threat is gendered.
Cybersecurity is typically concerned with military and corporate
security (and thus threats relating to espionage and economic theft). A
gendered understanding of cybersecurity threat, however, recognizes that
those "traditional" threats, such as denial of service attacks on State
services, have gendered outcomes.69]{.underline} It also recognizes that
intimate partner violence, doxing, cyberstalking and the non-consensual
dissemination of intimate images (i.e. "revenge porn") are also threats
that can arise from the intrusion into or disruption of personal devices
and networks.70 [In terms of technical processes, insofar as threat
monitoring relies on machine learning it is vulnerable to importing the
gendered issues that typify the machine learning field, including
gendered assumptions built into algorithms and biased
data.71]{.underline} Even this largely automated process rests on human
judgments about organizational priorities, allocation of resources and
capacity building -- all of which open the potential for the creation or
intensification of inequalities. For instance, an automated email filter
that identifies potentially harmful emails should flag romantic scams as
well as phishing emails and financial scams.72 [The processes of
preparing for and responding to threats are also gendered. Threat
simulations, for instance, such as the common practice of fake phishing
emails, often involve gender stereotyping (e.g. a woman in an assistant
role, a man as CEO).73]{.underline} There is a lack of
gender-disaggregated data on phishing victims, which makes the gender
consequences of phishing difficult to assess. But such an assessment is
essential since, if many cybersecurity breaches result from human error,
policy makers need to have a variety of approaches to the "human" making
the errors. Bug bounty programmes, which are a spectrum of ways for
"friendly" hackers to identify an organization's vulnerabilities and
defence responses through digital, social or physical vectors, raise
associated issues. As these contests are designed to be anonymous, only
pseudonymic data (i.e. pertaining to hackers' aliases) is available on
prolific bounty hunters and their payments. The consequences of this
anonymity are unclear: it may make it easier for women and LGBTQ+ people
to participate or it may exacerbate the gendered inequalities of
cybersecurity and hacking culture more generally (see the case study
below). [Furthermore, the characterization of threats themselves, from
the hooded hacker popular in media portrayals to code names and pictures
used in cybersecurity technical reports, also often include gendered
qualities and harmful stereotypes.74]{.underline} Finally, attempts to
protect organizations (and, to some extent, individuals) from the costs
and harms arising from cybersecurity attacks, predominantly through
cybersecurity insurance policies, should also be assessed for gender
implications.75 As with all insurance, it is important that threat
assessments include gender analysis; that the criteria for being
insurable can be met by women, men and non-binary people; and that
pricing for organizations and individuals does not rely on gender
stereotypes or produce discriminatory gender outcomes.76 4.1 Case study:
talent and expertise Talent and expertise is a widely recognized issue
in the cybersecurity industry. Although the question of talent and
expertise obviously pertains to all aspects of cybersecurity, we focus
here on the practice of "defence" (i.e. implementing security) since it
is typically understood as cybersecurity's central activity. Issues
around talent and expertise are often expressed as a "gap" in
cybersecurity expertise, meaning that the number of positions available
is greater than the number of people qualified to fill them.77 As
demonstrated by research by organizations such as the Global Forum on
Cyber Expertise, this talent gap is global, although pressures are
expressed differently in different local contexts.78 Many States have
taken steps to incentivize people to join the cybersecurity industry and
improve their level of skill once there. This is frequently complicated
by competitive pressure between governments and the private sector, as
government positions struggle to compete with private sector salaries.79
[These issues with talent and expertise are exacerbated by gendered
inequality, harms and visibility]{.underline}. Due to space constraints,
this section discusses these dynamics quite generally. [Understanding
how and why gendered gaps, inequalities and harms operate in context,
however, requires intersectional gender analysis that looks at how
gender, race, sexuality, class, and rural or urban location, among other
factors, interact to support the participation of some groups in cyber
fields while marginalizing others.]{.underline} A recent survey by the
International Information System Security Certification Consortium
indicated that 24 per cent of cybersecurity professionals worldwide are
women.80 The 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study found that
this lack of representation was accompanied by various forms of
inequality, with 87 per cent of women reporting unconscious
discrimination and 19 per cent overt discrimination.81 This is a widely
recognized problem, with many websites and social media accounts
creating "women in cybersecurity" networks and events specifically for
women.82 Similar events, networks and capacity-building initiatives also
exist to support the equality, equity and participation of queer people
in cybersecurity.83 Following criticism of a lack of representation and
visibility in cybersecurity conferences,84 events such as the RSA
Conference -- a prestigious series of international information
technology (IT) events -- have sought to ensure gender parity in keynote
speakers and to increase the participation of women overall.85 We split
the gender issues for cybersecurity talent and expertise into three
separate areas: the broader gender dynamics in science, technology,
mathematics and engineering (STEM) professions; gender in computer
science and coding; and gender in the cybersecurity industry
specifically. We recognize that not all cybersecurity positions are STEM
or "technical" positions; the prominence of these positions within
cybersecurity reflects a gendered valuation of jobs understood as
"masculine" above others. These positions are also, however, where
gender disparities are most evident, and so we focus on these positions
in this section. 4.1.1 Gender dynamics in STEM [Gender issues within
STEM professions -- again understood as a "gender gap" between men and
women -- are well-researched and typically understood in terms of
pipeline and retention.86 It should be noted that much of this research
and policy follows a binary, often heteronormative understanding of
gender; much more needs to be done to understand the experiences and
support the equitable participation of non-binary and queer people
within STEM and cybersecurity]{.underline}. The causes of the "gender
gap" are complex and context specific. [Generally, barriers to gender
equality in STEM include (a) disparities in access to infrastructure and
education; (b) individual- and family-level financial constraints and
priorities; and (c) the persistence of sociocultural and institutional
gender norms that suggest STEM professions are predominantly for
men.87]{.underline} In some contexts, such as Malaysia and the Middle
East, women's participation in STEM education is considerable but is not
translated into STEM careers.88 In the United States of America and the
United Kingdom, in contrast, girls remain less likely to be encouraged
to pursue study of STEM subjects and less likely to regard themselves as
holding STEM talent or expertise.89 Many of the policies aimed at
increasing the participation of women in STEM can also be applied to the
cybersecurity industry. These include greater incorporation of STEM
skills into girls' education;90 the promotion of STEM university
programmes to girls and women;91 actively recruiting women through
campus visits and social media campaigns;92 offering mentoring and
continuing education to women and girls already employed within
organizations; and altering human resources policies to prioritize
hiring and retaining women (e.g. by requiring that at least one woman be
interviewed for all open positions; by improving parental leave
policies, etc.).93 Disparities are often found in senior positions in
STEM and technology start-ups and, given that cybersecurity is a young
and fast-evolving field, the gendered dynamics of entrepreneurship are
highly relevant.94 4.1.2 Gender in computer science and coding [Fields
that centrally involve computers and "coding" (an unsatisfactorily
generic term for a wide range of distinct skills) have well-documented
gendered problems]{.underline}. Although, again, it differs across
contexts, there is a global digital literacy gap95 between women and
girls and men and boys.96 Worldwide, "327 million fewer women than men
have a smartphone and can access the mobile Internet", while women are
four times less likely than men to be IT professionals.97 [It is worth
remembering that early computing was relatively open to women and came
to be seen as a masculine profession only as it rose in social prestige
through its increasing importance to the economy.98 Research has
demonstrated that some online communities arranged around coding --
including gaming and hacking -- demonstrate a masculinist culture that
emphasizes aggressive language and individuated approaches to
problem-solving and technical mastery, while devaluing characteristics
perceived to be associated with femininity, such as empathy and the
expression of emotion.99 These cultures can be explicitly misogynistic
and homophobic, referring to women primarily as sex objects and to
LGBTQ+ people in hateful and exclusionary terms.100 As these communities
are often seen as a talent pool for cybersecurity expertise, there is a
risk that cybersecurity recruitment will import anti-feminist and
exclusionary norms (i.e. attitudes and practices that oppose and devalue
gender equality and racial, ethnic and sexual inclusivity) into the
workplace.101 This makes work environments uncomfortable (or hostile) to
those who do not conform.102]{.underline} The 2017 Global Information
Security Workforce Survey found that 51 per cent of women in the field
had experienced discrimination, compared to 15 per cent of men.103 This
primarily affects women and marginalized groups, but may also affect men
who do not identify with such norms.104 [Workplaces that do not have an
explicitly anti-feminist culture may still be organized and operated on
the assumption that most workers are men and that values and practices
associated with masculinity are neutral or "normal".105]{.underline}
Although often without discriminatory or conscious intent, this
perpetuates the gendered structure of cybersecurity expertise and thus
influences hiring, opportunities for promotion and the ability to
determine policy. Where women do enter these fields, their contribution
is often framed with reference to essentialist characteristics such as
emotional and social skills. [Although these are positive attributes,
framing women's contributions predominantly in terms of, for example,
empathy or caring solidifies gender stereotypes without necessarily
increasing the value attributed to emotional, social and caring aspects
of cyber expertise.106]{.underline} A greater presence of women (and
other members of marginalized groups) working in cybersecurity is
believed to have two benefits. First, it can contribute to creative
problem-solving and better policy governance and implementation through
the introduction of diverse perspectives.108 Second, it is believed that
these perspectives will lead to a gender perspective in cybersecurity
overall.109 Research indicates that this can occur but that, without
support, women and members of other minoritized groups may instead feel
pressure to adapt to the workplace norm.110 [Tokenized incorporation of
women and members of minoritized groups, without recognizing their
contributions or in ways that reinforce stereotypes, do not contribute
to meaningful participation or greater equality.111]{.underline} 4.1.3
Gender in the cybersecurity industry [Some gendered issues relate
specifically to the cybersecurity industry]{.underline}. As the field of
cybersecurity is growing in importance, influence and prestige, women's
participation in cybersecurity is a matter of equality and equity in
terms of opportunities for success, recognition and earning potential.
[Some working practices in cybersecurity, such as the shift requirements
of Security Operation Centres, require further analysis to assess their
gendered implications. Similarly, many cybersecurity certification
programmes require intense sprints with long hours, which is an
impractical work model for people (more likely to be women) with
childcare responsibilities.112 More subtly, the cultivation of work
environments, institutional cultures and management styles that are
skeptical of traditional or conventional authority, although often
praised as a characteristic of an innovative workforce, agile
organization and dynamic socio-technological sector, can facilitate a
narrow understanding of masculinity (and discrimination) akin to the
wider fields above.113]{.underline} Addressing the "gender gap" in
cybersecurity expertise therefore requires policies that promote the
inclusion and participation of women and gender training to reduce
harassment and discrimination and to support organizational and cultural
shifts to value a variety of activities and capacities, including those
usually more associated with femininity.114

### IR

#### Gender Hierarchy represents the ordering principle of an anarchical system of IR -- states operate according to constructed gendered identities where association with masculinity signals power, domination, honor, and chivalry in contrast to "weak" and "craven" femininities -- this binary structure justifies the infinite exploitation and subordination of the feminized.

**Sjoberg 17**

Sjoberg, British Academy Global Professor of Politics and International
Relations at Royal Holloway University of London. "The invisible
structures of anarchy: Gender, orders, and global politics," Journal of
International Political Theory. 2017.

The argument that **[gender is a constitutive element of the
international system]{.underline}** is an argument that **[assumptions
about gender are embedded in the ordering]{.underline}** principles
**[of the international system.]{.underline}** [This is consonant with
feminist observations of]{.underline} global politics,
[which]{.underline} have characterized the global political arena as a
"patriarchal structure of privilege and control" (Enloe, 1993: 70).
Others see the global political arena a place where **["the structure of
political communities has assumed gendered forms"]{.underline}**
(Steans, 2003: 43), and ordered by "gender relations \[which\] structure
social power" (Pettman, 1996: 43). These observations are rooted in
**[feminist work]{.underline}** which **[shows gender operating in how
political leaders are chosen]{.underline}** (Tickner, 1992), **[how
state governments work]{.underline}** (Peterson, 1992), **[how
militaries function]{.underline}** (Enloe, 1989), and **[how economic
benefit is distributed]{.underline}** (Pettman, 1996). **[States
have]{.underline}** been **[shown their]{.underline}** relative
**[military prowess,]{.underline}** judged and **[asserted
their]{.underline}** relative **[power,]{.underline}** **[and
demonstrated]{.underline}** and adjusted **[their relative economic
status through gendered competition using gendered
language]{.underline}** (e.g. Cohn, 1987). The [gender hierarchy in the
world "out there" can be read as replicated in the "commonsense ground"
or traditional theorizing in IR]{.underline}, which feminist theorists
(e.g. Tickner, 1988) have characterized as partial at best and
unrepresentative at worst because [it often analyzes the perspectives
and lives of only a small, elite, male portion of the global population.
Paralleling Waltz's understanding that anarchy can be seen manifested in
the function o**f**]{.underline} units ([states]{.underline}) in the
international arena, [in the distribution of relative
capacities]{.underline} among those units, [and in the execution of
political processes]{.underline}, Sjoberg (2012) argued that **[gender
is a constitutive factor in what states do]{.underline}**, important in
the distribution of states' relative capacities, and formative of
political processes among states. In substantiating the claim that
gender is a constitutive factor in what states do, [Sjoberg]{.underline}
(2012) [builds on previous feminist empirical work]{.underline} around
the world3 to suggest that **[states define their identities in gendered
ways, where gender and national identity are inextricably
linked]{.underline}**, as ["all nationalisms are gendered"]{.underline}
(McClintock, 1993) and [women are often the essence and symbols of the
reproduction of state and/or national identity]{.underline} (e.g.
Yuval-Davis, 1997). **[Hegemonic masculinities are among]{.underline}**
the **[influences that constitute nationalisms as gendered,
where]{.underline}** there is **[an ideal-typical notion of masculinity
that both states and the men]{.underline}** in them **[are expected to
live up to, creating a relationship between militarism, masculinity,
and]{.underline}** full **[citizenship]{.underline}** (Connell, 1995;
Young, 2003). For the influence of gender on distribution of capacity in
the international arena, Sjoberg (2012) builds on the feminist argument
that "**[the structural and ideological system that
perpetuates]{.underline}** the privileging of
**[masculinist]{.underline}**" in **[IR is "a principle cause
for]{.underline}** so many of the world's processes \[such as\]
**[empire-building, globalization, modernization"]{.underline}** (Enloe,
2004: 4, 6). Differences between dominant gender presentations and
subordinated gender presentations play a role in hierarchies in the
international arena, where **[it can be commonplace "to infantilize,
ignore, trivialize, or even actively cast scorn on what is thought to be
feminized"]{.underline}** (Enloe, 2004: 5). [What is thought to be
feminized is not just women but also states and]{.underline} other
[political actors.]{.underline} Feminist research has shown that
**[association with gender-based characteristics has been used
as]{.underline}** a marker of **[relative power in many policy
discourses]{.underline}** in diverse places around the world (e.g.
Agathangelou, 2002; Banerjee, 2012; Eichler, 2012; Weber, 1999;
Zalewski, 1994). In support of the argument that **[gender matters
in]{.underline}** shaping political processes, Sjoberg (2012) discusses
feminist work on **[a number of different processes in global politics,
including diplomacy]{.underline}** (Enloe, 2000), **[interstate
jurisprudence]{.underline}** (Charlesworth et al., 1991),
**[international institutions]{.underline}** (Moser and Moser, 2005),
**[interstate competition]{.underline}** (Peterson and Runyan, 2010),
**[and militarization]{.underline}** (Alexander, 2010). Feminist work on
militarization, for example, has shown that **[gender norms are used to
shape the will to fight, to sharpen training, to build group solidarity,
and to condition responses to battlefield injury]{.underline}** (e.g.
Alexander, 2010; Eichler, 2012; Enloe, 1993, 2000; Goldstein, 2001;
Sjoberg and Peet, 2011). While this section is not the place to
definitively explore the nature, direction, and contour of the influence
of gender on how the international system works, [this short outline of
existing evidence suggests]{.underline} that **[gender itself is an
ordering principle in global politics]{.underline}**, both
**[influencing the identity of actors and organizing them along
hierarchies within anarchy.]{.underline}** **[Feminist research provides
significant evidence that gender hierarchies are prevalent in global
politics]{.underline}**, and matter in not only the results but also the
constitution of interstate interactions. [It provides a mandate to
consider gender hierarchy as an important part of the ways that we think
about]{.underline} hierarchy [in global politics.]{.underline} One can
see these **[gender hierarchies manifest in a number of the everyday
(violent) features of global politics]{.underline}**--- places [where
women are being held unequal to men at]{.underline} the [local, state,
and global levels.]{.underline} [From rape culture to human trafficking,
unpaid care labor to g]{.underline}ender-[b]{.underline}ased
[v]{.underline}iolence, [nowhere in the world are women socially,
economically, or politically held equal to men.]{.underline} That is
hierarchy based on gender---gender hierarchy in global politics.

### "Manpower"

#### Use of the term "manpower" serves to gender labor in military institutions and devalue women's roles

[The use of 'manpower' to describe human resource management remains in
common parlance by NATO and in the military setting more broadly. Yet it
belies the contribution of serving women]{.underline}. Usually, it
refers to the availability of suitable recruits to fill military
capacity, and often the integration of women within the military service
is understood as a means to shore up recruitment shortfalls. However,
early Cold War manifestations within the alliance saw it also applied to
the distribution of (men and women's) labour across NATO member states,
which was deemed relevant to European security and stability, when war
was deemed highly possible (NATO, 1953). [There was a particular focus
on the availability of skilled labour or 'manpower' to support the
defence industry, however, population surpluses and migration with
Europe were also viewed as a potential source of unrest]{.underline}
(NATO, 1953). For example, the Working Group on Labour Mobility
considered the employment (and marital status) of civilian women across
different industries (NATO, 1957), supporting the notion that women have
always been of central importance to the functioning of the military, in
roles from camp follower, to soldier (Enloe, 1989). It was therefore
through discussion of recruitment shortfalls that NATO first considered
the integration of women into NATO Forces in the 1950s (NATO, 1954).
These preexisting institutional priorities are important to understand
as a starting point when considering the push by Senior NATO Military
Women to establish a Committee on Women in NATO Forces (as discussed in
Chapter 3). Their efforts were not the first time NATO considered the
integration of women, even if they did bring about a focal point and the
establishment of formal gender machinery within the alliance. The Expert
Working Group on Labour Mobility was tasked with addressing both
surpluses and shortages of 'manpower', reviewing member countries'
immigration policies with the aim of facilitating labour mobility. The
Working Group was specifically tasked with examining: (1) ways to
intensify migration; (2) projects designed to mitigate the impact of
manpower shortages on defence activities; and (3) preventive plans on
labour market disturbance in the case of war. The Working Group was
renamed in 1956 and became the Manpower Planning Committee (NATO, 2017).
They considered the impact of Italy's surplus and the UK's shortfall of
skilled workers in the defence industry (NATO, 1953). A particularly
interesting aspect of the Working Group/Committee was that it requested
reports from member states on their labour mobility status be submitted
to them. The reports fed into the work of the group and provided a
valuable overview of the status of labour mobility within the alliance.
Questionnaires were issued to member states requesting information on
'manpower' mobilisation, the availability and training of scientific and
technical 'manpower', arrangements for 'manpower' mobilisation in a
crisis, the role of employment services and the status of 'manpower'
employed by the host country of NATO HQ (NATO, 2017).3 [So, while early
consideration of 'manpower' issues was therefore solely instrumental, it
remained deeply gendered, focusing implicitly on men's
recruitment.]{.underline} In a 1954 annual review on national military
service, only a few countries enlisted women within the military (and
this was primarily to release men for employment in more active roles
due to manpower shortages) (NATO, 1954). Throughout NATO's earliest
years, most member states offered limited or no employment opportunities
for women in the armed forces. By the 1960s and 1970s, many countries
experienced a rise in public pressure for greater equality between women
and men in society. Responding to these pressures, the armed forces,
too, began increasing the numbers of women within the ranks, and
eventually opened up more employment opportunities that were once
exclusively reserved for men (Obradovic, 2014). NATO Officials have
continued to shape and reshape their respective 'personnel policies with
one eye on the personnel needs dictated by military doctrine and the
other eye on the preservation of the ideological bond between
masculinity and military service' (Enloe, 1993: 85). [This does not
mean, however, that the approaches of NATO member states have been
consistent. Rather, member states have learned the value of women in the
military through interaction with each other. This leads Enloe (1981) to
argue that NATO has functioned as a 'learning machine' or 'teaching
machine', sharing lessons on the integration of women into the armed
forces]{.underline}. For example, the US was successful in increasing
the number of women on active duty in its armed forces during the 1990s.
These women were held up by these who would once have rejected such a
move as an example of the US military's 'social enlightenment' (Enloe
1993: 86). The US, a leading NATO ally, began to measure other NATO
member states' sophistication on 'their ability to incorporate at least
token numbers of women without jeopardising the military's still crucial
identification with masculinized patriotism' (Enloe, 1993: 86). [The
official recognition of the Committee on Women in NATO Forces (CWINF) in
1976 led to a shift in focus for institutional consideration of
'manpower' issues]{.underline}. CWINF provided the framework for NATO's
role as a 'teaching machine' in respect of women's integration. For
example, the Netherlands took a proactive approach to the integration of
women into the military through opening all ranks to women from the
beginning of the integration process in the 1970s and putting in place
an anti-discrimination policy (Carreiras, 2006: 151). This resulted in
the Dutch Army being used as a test case by NATO, taking on a '
"pioneer" in eliminating restrictions on women in combat and operational
functions' (Carreiras, 2006: 155--6; Bolscher and Megens, 1991: 181).
[For a twenty-first-century NATO, globally engaged in a broad range of
theatres and activities, the preoccupation with military recruitment
persists]{.underline}. The move away from conscription towards all
volunteer forces in an increasing number NATO member states has further
elevated the issue of military recruitment (Obradovic, 2014). So, while
the immediate motivation for addressing recruitment shortfalls may have
changed, the concern remains a pressing one. As we discuss below in
relation to crisis management (and in Chapter 5 on the value of a gender
perspective), women's integration into NATO armed forces is now based on
a premise that they are an operational asset and provide 'added value'.
[The reconciliation of a concern with 'manpower' and women's status
within NATO Forces continues to be a key challenge for NATO today,
albeit in a different guise. Women's integration in NATO Forces has
never been motivated by a concern that NATO military forces reflect the
composition of the population they are intended to protect.]{.underline}
Perhaps unsurprisingly, given what we uncovered in Chapter 3, early
reflections on the use of this term 'manpower' were unsurprisingly
critical. For example, remarks by the first Chair of the Committee on
Women in NATO Forces, Colonel Else Martensen-Larsen, in 1975, is
indicative of the tension between valuing women as an asset and
advancing the status of women within the military towards equality:
[Whoever first coined the word 'manpower' did a grave disservice to the
women who today, in so many countries, are dedicating themselves to
vital defence tasks]{.underline}. I have often thought that it would be
worthwhile for the highest NATO authorities to take an active interest
in women's often difficult role as members of a marked minority placed
in a predominantly male world. (For, if women have successfully invaded
and conquered fields which were long exclusively the province of men,
the armed services still remain in many countries a well-protected
enclave.)

### Military

#### Militaries act as organized reproduction of hegemonic masculinity and appropriate feminist analysis to violent ends

masculinity." NATO, Gender, and the Military: Women Organising from

Militarised masculinities (plural) have been the source of much
scholarly debate and discussion in the field of Critical Military
Studies (see for example: Henry, 2017b; Higate, 2018; Henry, 2018).
[Military institutions are spaces which privilege militarised
masculinities over femininities. This matters because they function as
sites for the production of culture and gender. For example, the social
capital ascribed to forms of martiality (associated with masculinity)
within most societies contributes to the 'glorification of men's
participation in violence and war']{.underline} (Enloe, 1994; Henry,
2017b: 187). As a result, it is necessary to examine the socialisation
process which takes place in militarised settings (Henry, 2017b: 187).
It is also important to note that this process is far from homogenous,
indeed, it is complex and often contradictory. The shape militarised
masculinities takes differs among military institutions tasked with
defence of the air, sea and land. Further permutations are found at
national, regional and international level military institutions. [One
consistency is that it has always been a feature of sustaining
militaries and militarism more broadly.]{.underline} Militaries have,
traditionally, constructed a very narrowly defined, hegemonic ideal of
militarised masculinity. [In this sense the (re)production and promotion
of hegemonic masculinity in a military context is devised in relation to
the primary aim of the organisation, of war fighting and the deployment
of violence.]{.underline} As Connell identifies: 'studies of state
military forces show an organisational effort to produce and make
hegemonic a narrowly defined masculinity which will make its bearers
efficient in producing the organisation's effects of violence' (Connell,
2005: 259). [The military is therefore a space where qualities
associated with war fighting, security and defence are 'constantly
associated with men' (Hooper, 2001: 230) and men's bodies, where
soldiering is intimately fused with masculinity. As an institution of
hegemonic masculinity the military also promotes the association of men,
masculinity and soldiering via physicality and sexuality, largely in
opposition/relation to the feminine other]{.underline} (Morgan, 1994;
Bourke, 1996; Hooper, 2001; Via, 2010[). The promotion -- and often
aggressive reinforcement -- of heterosexuality has been seen as an
essential tool for promoting social cohesion and comradery between men
within the military]{.underline} (Kronsell, 2012: 44). Traditionally,
this fusion of men, masculinity and soldiering within militaries has
been facilitated by a literal exclusion of the feminine and homosexual
other. Where women have been included in military forces, their
inclusion was initially premised on exclusion from particular roles and
occupations, particularly those defined as 'direct combat' roles (see
for example, Kornblum, 1984; Horrigan, 1992). And homosexual men and
women have traditionally served without22 NATO as an institution
disclosure of their sexual orientation. In this regard, Hinojosa
identifies that hegemonic masculinity in the military manifests in both
'internal' and 'external' forms. External in the sense that: 'masculine
power is embedded in the structure of the institution' (2010: 180).
Examples of this can include the banning of women from particular combat
roles and the military rank system, which 'ensures that some men
maintain dominance over other men and women' (2010: 180--1) and
represent the gendered division of labour that characterises Connell's
(2006) conceptualisation of institutional gender regimes. Internal
hegemony in Hinojosa's conceptualisation is 'the hierarchical
structuring of masculinities such that some constructs are dominant and
privileged over other masculinities and femininities' (2010: 181). For
example, subordinate masculinities in a military context are often
patterned on a civilian/military divide, the variation of occupational
roles and across the various branches of the armed forces (Higate, 2003;
Barrett, 2008; Duncanson, 2009). Hinojosa's study of the construction of
particular hegemonic masculine ideals in the American military found
that non-military personnel, service members of different branches,
ranks and occupational specialities were cast as less physically able,
less self-disciplined, less willing to take risks by pre-active duty
servicemen, thereby creating patterns of 'discursive domination' (2010:
179). [In this sense, hegemonic masculinities within a military context
are both (organisationally) structural and a configuration of everyday
gendered social practice whereby individuals construct gender identities
in relation and opposition to other women and men]{.underline} (Connell,
2005; Hinojosa, 2010: 181). [In relation to the military, Duncanson
(2013) argues that there has been a 'softening' of dominant forms of
masculinity (see also, Niva, 1998; Whitworth, 2004); as the hegemonic
ideal appropriates certain characteristics from both subordinate
masculinities and femininity in order to 'refashion' the ideal and
respond to shifting cultural expectations (Duncanson, 2013: 61--2). Like
Demetriou (2001) and Messner (2007), the sceptical view is that this
appropriation, whilst refashioning expectations and masculine ideals
within the military, reinforces difference and inequality. For example,
Duncanson suggests that 'the new man of the military often depends on
the construction of those in areas of conflict as primitive, inherently
and excessively violent and barbaric, or as helpless
victims']{.underline} (Duncanson, 2013: 61, 2009). [The assertion here
is that even 'ostensibly progressive masculinities can have a deeply
regressive effect' and 'often further disempowers those already lacking
power, security and wealth']{.underline} (Duncanson, 2013: 61).
Therefore, hegemonic masculinities, as an assemblage of appropriated
traits that continue to be premised on reformulated patterns of
exclusion and subordination inhibit rather than indicate a potential for
transformative change. [In a military context, hegemonic masculinity has
been used to explain why it is that the creation of the 'New Man' (for
example, the heroic peacekeeper, the humanitarian soldier scholar) has
not resulted in gender equality or for that matter, genuine peace and
security on many military interventions]{.underline}. Yet, perhaps the
utility of the concept leads to too hasty conclusions in feminist
scholarship; to the automatic assumption that change in masculinities is
little more than the 'flexibility of the machinery of rule' (Duncanson,
2013: 71). [Duncanson offers an important note of caution on the
negative connotations of appropriation, change and transformation of
hegemonic masculinity, stating that it is too
deterministic.]{.underline} She argues that 'there is nothing in the
concept itself which necessitates an interpretation that it always
inevitably shifts in order that men retain power; that it can never be
transformed, dismantled' (Duncanson, 2013: 63). Connell and
Messerschmidt argue that research on hegemonic masculinity 'needs to
give much closer attention to the practices of women and to the
historical interplay of femininities and masculinities' (Connell and
Messerschmidt, 2005: 848). To do so, it is necessary to centralise
interaction of women and men, of masculinities and femininities in and
through specific institutional practices. In doing so, we provide
examples of understanding the construction of particular hegemonic and
subordinate masculinities and femininities within NATO. It is therefore
necessary to avoid essentialism, and assumed (negative) types, while
acknowledging the fluidity and hybridity between masculinities and
femininities. [Hegemonic masculinity therefore remains a valuable
theoretical and analytical tool, particularly when applied to a
militarised institutional setting such as NATO.]{.underline}

### NATO

#### NATO is an international system of hegemonic masculinity which reinforces gendered hierarchies through a masculine protection logic

masculinity." NATO, Gender, and the Military: Women Organising from
Within. Routledge Studies in Gender and Security. 2019. Pg 23-35. LJS

In order to understand how institutions can come to be 'institution of
hegemonic masculinity', we first need to consider how they are gendered.
Connell (2005: 73) argues that institutions 'are substantively, not just
metaphorically, gendered'. Gender is understood as prescriptive. It is
based upon socially constructed perceptions of the activities and
actions appropriate for each gender. It is also relational, which means
that masculinities and femininities do not exist independently
(Kronsell, 2016: 106). [The gendering of institutions manifests in
fluid, intersecting and contradictory ways, but largely in a manner that
privileges those individuals or groups in positions of power within
organisations -- these are usually (though not exclusively) men.
Consequently, patterns of inequality, disadvantage and subordination
result from this gendered privileging]{.underline}. This means that
'advantage and disadvantage, exploitation and control, action and
emotion, meaning and identity are patterned through and in terms of a
distinction between male and female, masculine and feminine' (Acker,
1990: 146). [Institutions are gendered in the way they include, or
exclude, gender from policy processes and this contributes to the way in
which power is structured and normalised]{.underline} (Mackay, Kenny and
Chappell, 2010: 582). Gender and gendered identities are intertwined in
the day-to-day activities of the institution, rather than pre-existing
in society or fixed to individuals (Mackay, Kenny and Chappell, 2010:
580). [Gender can therefore be viewed as an organising
principle]{.underline} (Walby, 2009: 260). These are built upon
'organisation history and associated with a different configuration of
personal experiences and consciousness' (Connell, 2002: 844). [Taking
institutions seriously as gendered spaces equips us with an
understanding of how actors, institutional culture and structures shape
policies]{.underline} (Gains and Lowndes, 2014: 525). [Institutions,
conceptualised as both formal and informal rules and norms, do not
operate in a bubble, rather they reflect wider social hierarchies and
reproduce gender norms through including or silencing gender from the
policy-making process]{.underline} (Guerrina, Chappell and Wright, 2018:
1041). [NATO's role as a military actor means it falls into the category
of an 'extreme case of the gendered organisation']{.underline}
(Carreiras, 2006: 40). Britton (2000) outlines three criteria for
gendered institutions which are applicable to NATO. [These are: (1)
structures that make a distinction between masculinity and femininity;
(2) the preponderance of male bodies; and (3) built upon hegemonic
masculinities]{.underline} (Britton, 2000). [The formalisation of these
norms contributes to the construction of gender regimes, reifying
gendered power structures.]{.underline} A gender regime is a 'set of
interconnected gender relations and gendered institutions that
constitute a system' (Walby, 2009: 104, 2011: 301). Gender regimes refer
to the configuration of gender relations in a particular setting, they
exist in all institutional structures and at the same time are unique to
each institutional context (Walby, 1997: 6). They are built upon
'organisation history and associated with a different configuration of
personal experiences and consciousness' (Connell, 2002: 844). Gender
regimes therefore operate in myriad ways and at different intersecting
levels, from cultural to institutional and organisational. Connell and
Messerschmidt (2005: 6) identify the gender regime of an institution as
'the patterning of gender relations in that institution and especially
the continuing pattern which provides the structural context of
particular relationships and individual practices'. [So, if we accept
that institutions are gendered, what counts as an institution of
hegemonic masculinity? In the broadest sense such institutions can be
defined as ones 'largely governed by men' that have produced and
recreated norms and practices associated with masculinity and
heterosexuality]{.underline} (Kronsell, 2005: 281). [This helps explain
why women in minority positions among men in organisation structures
were likely to become 'tokens', perceived of as representative of all
women]{.underline} (Kanter, 1977: 382). [However, in much the same way
that hegemonic masculinity is not 'numerically' dominant, the
conceptualisation of institutions of hegemonic masculinity incorporates
more than the mere physical presence (or dominance) of men's bodies.
Institutions of hegemonic masculinity serve a particular (common)
purpose: they are institutions or organisations where male power and
dominance is reified and reinforced through organisational practices and
discourses (see for example, Cohn, 1987). They are spaces within which
particular masculine behaviours and practices are normalised, where
particular understandings of masculinities (and femininities) are
(re)produced and formalised]{.underline}. As Hooper notes: 'Masculinity
appears to have no stable ingredients and therefore its power depends
entirely on certain qualities constantly being associated with men ...
masculine spaces are precisely the places where such associations are
cemented and naturalised' (Hooper, 2001: 230). In this sense,
institutions of hegemonic masculinity provide such a space; where
cultural norms that privilege men, and values associated with
masculinity, intersect with institutional power structures and the
physical presence of male bodies, to cement male dominance. The
organisational space provides the link between cultural ideals and
institutional power that Connell (2005: 77) argues is required for the
establishment of hegemony. As Kronsell argues, 'to be hegemonic,
cultural norms must be supported by institutional power' (Kronsell,
2005: 281). [Though not exclusively 'male spaces', institutions of
hegemonic masculinity are also traditionally patterned through a high
level of segregation between the sexes and particular gendered divisions
of labour]{.underline}. Institutions have traditionally constructed
different spheres of activity for women and men to occupy -- and this
historically constructed division (and the norms it creates around male
behaviour) helps to secure the continuity of institutions of hegemonic
masculinity (Kronsell, 2005: 285). Institutions of hegemonic masculinity
therefore provide the structural space for the (re)production of
particular cultural understandings of gender, power and inequality.
[Institutions of hegemonic masculinity are organisations where male
power and dominance is reified and reinforced through both formal and
informal practices and discourses. They are spaces within which
particular masculine behaviours, ways of 'being' and 'doing' are
normalised; where particular understandings of masculinities (and
femininities) are (re)produced and formalised.]{.underline} Yet within
institutions of hegemonic masculinity, masculinity itself is usually
silent, or 'unseen' due to its ubiquity (Kronsell, 2005). [The process
of normalisation, of making masculine practices and behaviours the 'norm
for appropriate conduct', makes masculinity appear 'natural' and
therefore difficult to critique]{.underline} (Kronsell, 2005: 282--4).
[Masculinity is 'not named' because it omnipresent, all-encompassing
within these particular institutions]{.underline}. Indeed, as Acker
argues, 'as a relational phenomenon, gender is difficult to see when
only the masculine is present' (Kronsell, 1990: 142). Masculinity is not
a stable construct and appears to have no 'stable ingredients' (Hooper,
2001: 230[). Institutions of hegemonic masculinity provide a key site
for this contestation; where cultural norms which privilege men, and
values associated with masculinity, intersect with institutional power
structures and the physical presence of male bodies, to cement male
dominance. The organisational space provides the link between cultural
ideals and institutional power that is required for the establishment of
hegemony]{.underline} (Connell, 2005: 77). It is important to stress
here that existence of hegemonic masculinity in the military context
does not preclude transformation of military institutions through
challenging hegemonic masculinities. Such a transformation would create
an institution which 'equally values "masculine" and "feminine" traits,
so much so that they cease to be masculine and feminine' (Duncanson and
Woodward, 2015: 12). Duncanson and Woodward argue that a 'regendered
military' is one where: soldiering is not a masculine identity, but
becomes much more fluid, and is constructed through relations of
equality, empathy, care, respect, and recognition of similarities and
shared experiences. The displacement of gendered dichotomies is
immediately recognizable in this conceptualization. Not only are the
meanings of masculinity and femininity questioned, but so is the valuing
of masculinity over femininity and therefore the hierarchical thinking
and material domination that has characterized gender relations. There
therefore remain possibilities to displace hegemonic masculinity
(Connell, 2005; Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005). Even if these
possibilities have been lost in application empirical case studies. As
Duncanson (2015: 244) argues, to realise this, 'hierarchical relations
must be replaced with relations of equality, mutual respect, or
empathy'. She critiques Connell's (2002) suggestion that the transition
phase should be one where a masculinity open to equality within women is
hegemonised. Rather, the transitory stage has to be one where
traditionally disparaged, feminized traits are newly valued and
incorporated into 'softer' or hybrid masculinities. The forging of more
equal relations is the ultimate, more challenging stage. The hybrid
stage may make it more likely that relations of equality, mutual
respect, empathy, and so on, are formed, however, so rather than dismiss
the New Man syndrome in all its contexts, assuming it always camouflages
the continuation of patriarchy, militarism, and neoliberalism, we can
look to expose its contradictions and to push for those relations of
equality. (Duncanson, 2015: 244) Implications for the masculinist
protection logic Gender is an issue for the military (and military
institutions) which 'is often obvious, apparent and visible' at the same
time that it is 'obscured, normalised, lived with and ignored' (Woodward
and Winter, 2007: 3). Hurley's (2018: 16) study of men 'doing' gender
work at NATO draws out the contradictions underpinning the way in which
'women's rights' and equality are expressed within the institution. This
is a recurring theme which manifests itself in NATO's development and
understanding of a gender perspective as we go onto discuss in Chapter
5. This finds gender issues articulated within a masculinist protection
logic. [Entwined with understanding NATO as an institution of hegemonic
masculinity is therefore the logic of masculinist
protection]{.underline} (Young, 2003). Understanding masculinist
protection logic requires moving away from using gender in an
explanatory manner or as a variable. For example, through attempts to
connect the violence of states and institutions to particular
behavioural propensities of women and men. Rather, it is necessary to
understand gender as an element of interpretation. As Young (2003: 2)
argues: viewing issues of war and security through a gendered lens ...
means seeing how a certain logic of gendered meanings and images helps
organise the way people interpret events and circumstances, along with
the positions and possibilities for action within them. [The logic of
masculinist protection extends the position of the male head of
household as a protector of the family, to encompass male leaders more
generally as protectors of a given population]{.underline} (Stiehm,
1982; Young, 2003). The logic of masculinist protection is premised on
an understanding of variation and plurality in masculinities;
specifically, the relationship between 'dominative masculinity' and that
of the 'protector masculinity' (Young, 2003: 4). Masculinist protection
recalls a 'rather more benign image of masculinity': 'the role of this
courageous, responsible and virtuous man is that of protector' (Young,
2003: 4). [This is constructed in opposition to an 'other' masculinity
embodied by 'bad' men who exploit, harm and abuse the vulnerable for the
pleasures of domination]{.underline} (Young, 2003: 4). The flip side to
this coin is that 'feminine subordination, in this logic, does not
constitute submission to a violent and overbearing bully' (Young, 2003:
5). [Feminist subordination is not submission to a 'dominative
masculinity' or the 'bad men'. Subordination is this sense forms part of
an exchange between the protector and the protected]{.underline}: 'In
return for male protection, the woman concedes critical distance from
decision-making autonomy' (Young, 2003: 4). [As a consequence of this
exchange the protected woman defers to the protectors judgement, looks
up to him with gratitude for his manliness and admiration for his
willingness to face the dangers of the world]{.underline} (Young, 2003:
5); this gratitude in turn reinforces his perception of his own
masculinity and worth. [And yet, power inequalities, domination and
subordination persist within this logic]{.underline}: 'the role of the
masculine protector puts those protected, paradigmatically women and
children, in a subordinate position of dependence and obedience' (Young,
2003: 2). Drawing upon Foucault's notion of pastoral power, Young
suggests that masculinist protection is a power marked out by virtue and
love (Young, 2003: 6), appearing 'gentle and benevolent both to its
wielders and to those under its sway' (Young, 2003: 6[). Military
masculinity is as much about performance as it is about
action]{.underline} (Partis-Jennings, 2017: 3). This understanding has
parallels with Kronsell's understanding of the presence and persistence
of gendered norms in institutions. [Here, gendered norms have been built
into the 'walls' of institutions, whose structure appears so natural and
'supportive' that it becomes difficult to see them also as exclusionary
barriers]{.underline} (Kronsell, 2005: 291). [Couching gender
mainstreaming initiatives and framing the gender perspective in a
'supportive' logic of masculine protection reinforces particular
inequalities and barriers whilst projecting an image of care and
consideration for women working both inside and outside of
NATO.]{.underline} The logic of masculinist protection provides one
particular way in which the hegemonic masculine norms of the
organisation imprint on, condition and control understandings of the
gender perspective. [In this sense a logic of masculinist protection can
be seen to be embedded within the hegemonic norms of NATO. At the more
abstract level, NATO can be seen as a collectivisation of the security
state, protecting its citizens from an 'other' and external threat,
beyond the imagined borders of the alliance]{.underline}. The citizen,
in this reading, as 'protected', defers decision-making autonomy to the
nation state as protector and by extension the NATO alliance. [In this
sense NATO itself can be viewed as a masculinist protector, a role that
reinforces the hegemonic militaristic ideals and norms that were
identified above. This gendered logic helps NATO to define and locate
itself and frame the gender perspective in a broader sense]{.underline}
(Hurley, 2018). NATO as an institution of international hegemonic
masculinity We argue that NATO is an international military institution
constituting a particular gender regime. [This leads NATO to function as
an institution of international hegemonic masculinity]{.underline}. NATO
is characterised by a particular gendered division of labour (both in
regard to particular jobs that women and men 'traditionally' occupy, and
to those that women are still excluded either formally or informally
from) (Connell, 2002, 2006: 7). [NATO is also characterised by gendered
relations of power expressed through gendered institutional practices,
symbolism and discourses]{.underline}. Although a complex institution
with a dual political-military structure, NATO's purpose is as a
military alliance committed to collective defence, cooperative security
and crisis management (NATO, 2010). NATO armed forces composed of
national militaries are therefore a focal point of alliance activity.
Yet, the national armed forces of NATO member states are still
overwhelmingly male-dominated (Schjølset, 2013). This offers one way in
which we can argue that NATO is premised upon hegemonic masculinity
(Kronsell, 2012). At this point, it is worth offering a note of caution
when extrapolating from the 'national' to the 'international'. As
Connell and Messerschmidt note when discussing a 'global gender order':
'it is tempting to assume a simple hierarchy of power and authority,
running from global to regional to local' (Connell and Messerschmidt,
2005: 850) -- or indeed from the national to the international. Power,
authority and gender are constructed and contested at multiple,
multifaceted levels. NATO is an institution made up of the military
forces of multiple and varied national armed forces with particular
cultural practices and variation and, in this sense, there is a danger
of oversimplifying the concept of 'the military'. However, as Goldstein
(2001) has identified, militaries are 'institutions that have largely
been governed by men and have produced and recreated norms and practices
associated with particular forms and ideals of masculinity that are
surprisingly consistent across cultures and time' (in Kronsell, 2012:
44). It can be legitimately argued that one of the reasons why NATO
works effectively as a collective military alliance is the similarity in
the military norms and practices across its 29 member states. Similarly,
NATO's supranational institutional structures have been developing and
integrating for 70 years and have proved adept at accommodating various
phases of expansion and the incorporation of new member states'
militaries. Invoking Enloe (2000: 131) to ask 'where are the women?'
provides a valuable starting point for the study of international
institutions and understanding if, and how, they operate as institutions
of hegemonic masculinity. This question makes men visible in a way they
were not before (Enloe and Zalewski, 1999: 138). It draws attention not
just to the reliance of institutions on women, but on the relationship
between women and men (Enloe, 2014: 131). [The location of women and men
within an organisational structure is indicative of the value ascribed
to them]{.underline}. To understand the ways in which military
institutions are gendered it is necessary to investigate not only the
meanings of masculinity and femininity, but also to ask 'how these
meanings determine where women are and what they think about being
there' (Enloe, 2014: 8). Military institutions analyse their own gender
and racialised cultures, often to support operational effectiveness
(Henry, 2017b: 187). Such analysis is something NATO engages in, albeit
selectively. [As we discuss below, NATO has been elusive in publishing
up-to-date figures on gender balance and diversity in NATO HQ in recent
years. This stands in contrast to the push for transparency from the
NCGP on gender and diversity among NATO armed forces]{.underline}. As we
discuss in Chapter 2, the NCGP now publishes an annual report detailing
the status of women and engagement with Women, Peace and Security across
NATO member and partner states (NATO, 2017). [There is therefore a
significant discrepancy between the transparency expected of NATO member
and partner states, compared to that practiced by NATO as an institution
itself.]{.underline} Despite this opaqueness on sharing data on those
employed at NATO HQ, efforts to address gender and diversity have
emerged since the early 2000s. [However, as Ahmed (2007) draws attention
to, the language of diversity is problematic. For postcolonial scholars,
it 'reifies difference as something that exists "in" the bodies or
culture of others, such that difference becomes a national property'
(Ahmed, 2007: 235). Management studies scholars have highlighted the
commodification of 'diversity' and how it is bound up with neoliberal
logics. Difference is individualised, and the term distracts from
continuing systemic inequalities (Ahmed, 2007: 236). When institutions
embrace 'diversity', it can be read as a lack of commitment to
change]{.underline} (Ahmed, 2007: 236). In the context of a military
institution, diversity takes on new meanings. [Diversity for NATO is
understood narrowly as referring to national representation or gender,
rather than race, disability or other characteristics]{.underline}
(NATO, 2011). [For example, NATO does not collect data on the ethnicity
of its staff]{.underline} (NATO, 2011). The focus on national
representation is to be expected given this has proved a highly
sensitive issue for an expanding multilateral institution (Dijkstra,
2015: 13). [Yet, the silence in respect to race and ethnicity in NATO's
understanding of, and data on, diversity serves to depoliticise
'diversity' through divorcing it from wider intersectional
understandings]{.underline} (Henry, 2017b: 185). The absence of efforts
to address diversity beyond national representation and gender could
indicate that this is a controversial issue among NATO member states.
NATO relies on consensus-based decision making, reflective of its
position as an alliance, rather than an supranational body. No member
can be forced to take a position it does not agree with (Pouliot, 2016).
The conflation of gender with diversity by NATO (NATO, 2016) is also
problematic, but is perhaps reflective of a broader articulation of
diversity within military contexts (Woodward and Winter, 2006; Kronsell,
2012). This understanding of diversity at a national level may help
explain why diversity has been introduced at NATO in this way.
[Diversity as 'gender diversity' means adding women to existing
structures, rather than seeking to 'regender' them]{.underline}
(Duncanson and Woodward, 2015). [An approach which 'adds women and
stirs' does not challenge gendered structures. As Hudson (2009: 291)
argues such liberal approaches 'add' women to the 'discourse with the
assumption that they will behave like men when given men's roles and
that the fundamental frameworks ... though they were created by men for
men, are unproblematic and will remain intact']{.underline}. This
contradicts the lived experiences of many women (Hudson, 2009: 291).
[Moreover, the gender diversity argument is problematic because it rests
on the assumption that women are something inherently different to men,
and will perform the diversity expected of them]{.underline} (Kronsell,
2012: 67). The result, as Kronsell (2012: 67) argues, is that 'the
majority is simultaneously constructed as homogenous and as naturally
associated with the organisation'. In 2002, the NATO Prague Summit
established a task force to address imbalance in gender, age and
national representation. The subsequent report opposed the imposition of
quotas to support representation but did recommend the creation of an
Action Plan (NATO, 2011). These efforts predate NATO's engagement with
WPS and, until 2014, the two were treated as separate in NATO policies.
This is despite the fact that UNSCR 1325 calls for the 'increased
representation of women at all decision-making levels in national,
regional and international institutions' (United Nations Security
Council, 2000). The Action Plan produced by the task force covered the
period from 2007 to 2010. It is not available publicly.1 However, the
NATO website states that the Action Plan had three key objectives: (1)
to maintain a NATO Diversity Framework and Policy; (2) to improve NATO's
work environment; and (3) to promote the image of NATO as an 'employer
of choice' (NATO, 2011), the third objective drawing attention to the
instrumental benefits of being seen to engage with gender and diversity
issues for improving NATO's image[. This is also reflected in NATO's
more recent engagement with WPS which has identified NATO's engagement
with the agenda as a positive public relations story]{.underline}
(Wright, 2019: 98). It is not evident whether NATO revised the 2007--10
Action Plan as the related webpage has not been updated since 2011
(NATO, 2011). The approval and implementation of a revised Diversity
Action Plan is an outcome for the 2016 NATO/EAPC Policy, yet the
existence of such a document has not been made public. This could also
indicate that there has not been one in place since the previous one
expired in 2010. A revision of the Action Plan should be accompanied by
the public release of up-to-date gender and diversity data so it is
possible to review what progress NATO has made. [Despite some advances
in women's representation, it is of little surprise that NATO has been
accused of being an anachronistic 'men-only club']{.underline}
(Harrison, 2014). Reports on gender and diversity within the
International Staff have not been made publicly available since 2012
(NATO, 2012c). The latest data on gender balance at NATO Headquarters
comes from the Global Study on the Implementation of the WPS agenda
commissioned by UN Women. The report finds that at NATO Headquarters in
Brussels just six of the 38 (16%) executive leadership positions are
held by women (Coomaraswamy, 2015: 258). NATO's international military
command structures (NATO HQ, Allied Command Operations -ACO, Allied
Command Transformation -- ACT) are also largely staffed by men. The NCGP
is currently the only NATO committee to be headed by a woman. At the
highest levels of NATO's governance structures, some small progress has
been made towards women's inclusion. For example, representation of
women in NATO's principle decision-making body, the North Atlantic
Council (NAC), has significantly improved in recent years with women now
making up 28% of permanent representatives (NATO, 2018c), compared to
11% just four years ago (Fellin, 2014: 22). In contrast, there are no
women representatives on the Military Committee (NATO, 2018a). This
could be viewed as surprising given women now account for 24% of NATO
defence ministers (NATO, 2018b). However, it also reflects the fact that
NATO armed forces member states are still overwhelmingly male-dominated
(Schjølset, 2013), at an average of just 10.9% women (NATO, 2017). [So
while gendered institutions can and are found in all areas of social and
political life, military institutions represent an 'extreme'
case]{.underline} (Carreiras, 2006: 40[). 'Gender war roles' have been
shown to be a hardy feature, serving 'to organise men's bodies into
military organisations and women's bodies out']{.underline} (Kronsell,
2016: 2). The under-representation of women is the responsibility of
member states, and in respect to the Defence Ministers, reflective of a
wider absence of women in politics from key government portfolios
(Annesley and Gains, 2012). Yet, the improvements made in working
towards gender balance among permanent representatives, and in NATO
defence ministers, also suggest that there is an appetite among member
states for women to be better represented. NATO remains an institution
dominated by men in decision-making roles. It is also a long way from
even considering the possibility of a woman as Secretary General
(Harrison, 2014). Yet the few senior women within NATO are increasingly
visible in outward-facing roles. For example, Rose Gottemoeller became
the first woman to hold the position of Deputy Secretary General in
2016. The NATO Spokesperson, Oana Lungescu, is another example of a
woman appointed to a position central to the alliance's public
presentation, and the Press Office remains an exception as a department
to reach a gender balance (six women to six men) (NATO, 2018d). The
Assistant Secretary for General Public Diplomacy also provides an
exception among the Assistant Secretary General Portfolios as one held
more than once by a woman. The appointment of an Assistant Secretary
General is much coveted by allies because of the prestige and influence
which comes with the post. This has historically been a legacy position
and dominated by the larger allies. However, Secretary General Rasmussen
was successful in opening all positions, including Assistant Secretary
General, to open competition (Dijkstra, 2015: 12). This paved the way
for the Croatian Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović2 to take office in 2011. It is
also noteworthy that GrabarKitarović became the unofficial figurehead
for NATO's engagement with Women, Peace and Security prior to the
creation of the NATO Special Representative on WPS in 2012 (Baker,
2015). The position has also been held by two other women: Stefanie
Babst (acting, 2010--11) and Carmen Romero (2016--). This demonstrates a
trend for senior women within NATO to be appointed to roles with high
public visibility, rather than those roles considered to constitute the
core business of NATO as a defence and security institution (Wright,
2016: 358). The outsider observer could be left with the impression that
there has been a greater challenge to the dominance of men's bodies
within NATO than there actually has been. Directing our scrutiny upwards
to take intersectionality seriously through identifying the gendered and
racialised structures upholding military institutions is also necessary.
This requires moving beyond understanding multiple differences and their
impact upon the individual. It requires exposing 'intersecting
oppressions or systems of oppression' (Crenshaw, 1989; Crenshaw et al.,
1991) in order to provide the tools to challenge the 'hegemonic position
of men (or some women)' in military structures (Henry, 2017b: 195). An
intersectional lens exposes the 'privileges, benefits, and power gains
maintained and crystallized through either the power of the military or
the patriarchy itself' (Henry, 2017b: 195). As Henry argues, only by
re-politicising intersectionality through this understanding does it
become possible to 'smash imperial white supremacist capitalist
heteropatriarchy' (Henry, 2018). Perhaps reflective of NATO's reluctance
to address diversity as an issue related to race and ethnicity, the
characteristics of the military male body within NATO are also
noteworthy. From a visual analysis of Figure 1.1 (below) we see the
dominance of white men's bodies in the NATO Military Committee. This is
also reflected in the composition of the NAC (although as noted above
there are some women at the table) (NATO, 2018c). The North Atlantic
Council, NATO's pre-eminent decision-making body might be more diverse
in terms of gender, yet it also glaringly white. Like the NAC, which is
composed of member states' permanent representatives to NATO, the
Military Committee is made up of member states' Military
Representatives.3 Both forums rely on member states to populate them.
NATO member states have a sizeable number of non-white citizens who are
not reflected here. The composition of the NATO Military Committee also
mirrors the European Union's Military Committee (Kronsell, 2015: 9). The
defining characteristics of elite military leaders across Europe and the
West has changed little, bar a few exceptions, since NATO's foundation
70 years ago. Militaries, particularly in a European and a North
American context, are exemplars of institutions of hegemonic masculinity
(Connell, 1995: 213). The national armed forces of NATO member states
are still overwhelmingly male-dominated (Schjølset, 2010).
Traditionally, it is men and men's bodies that have (almost exclusively)
occupied the structures of military institutions, at every level in
varying positions of power and subordination (Higate, 2003).NATO as an
institution 33 The dominance of men's bodies and masculine practices
(Kronsell, 2015: 284) and a division of labour along gender lines both
in terms of roles and physical space (Acker, 1990: 146--7) are evident
within NATO. This recreates norms and practices associated with
masculinity and heterosexuality, which when coupled with institutional
power results in hegemonic masculinity (Kronsell, 2005: 281). [However,
in much the same way that hegemonic masculinity is not 'numerically'
dominant among men (Connell, 2005), the conceptualisation of
institutions of hegemonic masculinity incorporates more than the mere
physical presence (or dominance) of male bodies]{.underline}. Describing
an occupation as feminised or masculinised, or more generically as
gendered, is not at the same as noting that it is dominated by men or
women. Identifying where women and men are within the organisational
structure is a useful starting point because military institutions are
built on gender war roles, which tend to organise men's bodies in and
women's bodies out (Kronsell, 2015). However, conflating the two can
keep us from seeing contexts in which work dominated by men, for
example, is more or less masculinised. It may also obscure the
historical process through which definitions of gender-appropriate work
are shaped. [In addition to this dominance of men's bodies, the norms,
behaviours and discourses of NATO, transferred up and through national
military structures, are also heavily masculinised]{.underline}.
'Internal' hegemonic masculinity (in Hinojosa's (2010)
conceptualisation) is also produced as a configuration of everyday
social Figure 1.1 179th Military Committee in Chiefs of Defence Session,
May 2018, NATO HQ, Brussels, Belgium.34 NATO as an institution practice
(Hurley, 2018a). [For example, perceived transgressions from the ideal
type militarised masculinity are policed through trivialisation and
feminisation (Hurley, 2018a: 4) or the 'rules-in-use']{.underline}
(Leach and Lowndes, 2007: 186). [In this sense NATO is taken as a site
of hegemonic masculinity wherein particular processes and relationships
are located, through which individual and collective groups of men and
women conduct gendered lives]{.underline} (Connell, 2005a: 71[). NATO
also occupies a position within the international security
infrastructure and in this sense its actions (as a collective
organisation) are situated, and saturated in international security
discourses that value and privilege the masculine -- 'strength',
'rationality' -- over the feminine -- 'weakness, emotion' (Via, 2010:
43; Tickner, 1992; Hooper, 2001) and are imbued with narratives of
masculinist protection (Young, 2003) as we outline above.]{.underline}
This leads us to argue that NATO is not just an institution of hegemonic
masculinity but an institution of international hegemonic masculinity[.
This extends the understanding of NATO's as a 'teaching machine' sharing
lessons on the integration of women in the military and the value of
WPS]{.underline} (Enloe, 1981; Wright, 2016). There are two
co-constituting elements to NATO's role as an institution of
international hegemonic masculinity (see Figure 1.2 below). [First,
NATO, we argue, through socialisation of 29 member states and a growing
number of partner states, the value of military masculinity is
'learned'.]{.underline} NATO states meeting at the level of the North
Atlantic Council, through the Military Committee or in other fora such
as committees (including the NATO Committee on Gender Perspectives),
learn from each other what NATO's role in the world is and how this
should be embodied. Through NATO operations, including the former
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and current operation
Resolute Support in Afghanistan, NATO, member and partner states work
together and learn in practice what these values are. [Second, NATO, as
we argue above, has therefore taken on the role of masculinist protector
which reinforces hegemonic militaristic, masculine ideals and
norms]{.underline}. The enactment of this masculine protection logic
further reinforces the notion of NATO as an institution of international
hegemonic masculinity. [This feeds into, and is further reinforced
through, NATO's role as 'teaching machine'.]{.underline} Figure 1.2
Conceptualising NATO as an institution of international hegemonic
masculinity. The two aspects of NATO's role as an institution of
international hegemonic masculinity are therefore co-constitutive. As we
go into discuss in Chapters 2 and 5, this helps explain why NATO's
engagement with Women, Peace and Security and a gender perspective has
been outward-facing, something NATO can engage with and utilise
externally rather than being used to reflect inwards on NATO itself.

#### NATO adoptions gender policy to insulate itself from criticism and to serve pre-existing militarist agendas

The first iteration of the NATO/EAPC Policy is a brief document. It acts
more as a normative aspiration for what NATO can achieve through
engagement with the WPS agenda, rather than as a detailed policy action
plan. It quotes verbatim from NATO's foundational values outlined in The
Washington Treaty, and is presented as a tool to promote 'democracy,
individual liberty and the rule of law' (NATO, 2007). The policy focuses
primarily on operational aspects, with the intention that further work
would take place to identify the wider applicability of WPS.
Specifically, it calls for NATO Military Authorities to take the lead in
developing practical proposals for engagement with the agenda. The
broader context is key to understanding the operational focus. At this
time, the NATOled ISAF Operation was in a particularly difficult stage
as a result of Taliban insurgency (Johnson and Mason, 2007). [There was
an emerging realisation that gender was key to understanding
Afghanistan, and there was a need to engage the whole population. This
was evidenced in the deployment of Female Engagement Teams (FETs)
(Mcbride and Wibben, 2012). The additional need to improve dialogue
among a wide pool of contributors (Mattelaer, 2011: 598) provided
another incentive for NATO's engagement with WPS. This also contributes
to explaining the centrality of partners to NATO's engagement with
WPS.]{.underline} WPS offered a shared starting point for NATO to foster
a 'community of practice' with partners (Wagnsson, 2011: 598). The 2007
NATO/EAPC Policy on UNSCR 1325 was never intended as a transformative
document, rather it was intended as a catalyst for further engagement
with gender as an operational imperative. It took four years for the
NATO/EAPC Policy to be revised and extended. The 2011 version moves
beyond a narrow focus on operational issues. It outlines a six-track
approach for the implementation of UNSCR 1325. This includes a
commitment to mainstream WPS across policies, programmes and
documentation in order to benefit the 'daily work of the organisation,
its staff and committees' (NATO, 2011[). WPS is also outlined as a means
to foster cooperation with international organisations and civil
society, including 'exchanges of information, best practices and
expertise, as well as practical cooperation']{.underline} (NATO, 2011).
[This supports and extends Enloe's (1983) conception of NATO as a
'teaching machine' in respect to gender, sharing lessons among member
states on the integration of women into NATO Forces. Here, we see NATO's
role as a 'teaching machine' extending to include other actors, as well
as relating to WPS specifically (Wright, 2016). It also demonstrates the
'added value' of WPS for NATO as a means to bring in civil society, a
group of actors the alliance had previously not sought meaningful
engagement with]{.underline} (Mayer, 2008: 117). As well as other
international organisations, such as the EU, which while NATO has had a
long-standing 'strategic' partnership with, it has been beset with
'long-standing political blockages' (Smith and Gebhard, 2017: 305). [The
understanding of both women's bodies, and a gender perspective as a
means to support operational effectiveness supports the broader context
against which this policy was adopted. NATO's involvement in
Afghanistan, where gender (or women) became beneficial in rhetoric,
doctrine and practice (Dyvik, 2013: 412), contributed both to NATO's
engagement with WPS but also supported a very particular understanding
of gender (Wright, 2016: 356). Of particular note, is the aim for WPS
'to become an integral and complementary part of NATO's corporate
identity']{.underline} (NATO, 2011c). This is interesting in two
respects. [First, the adoption of UNSCR 1325 is implied as something a
'good' institution would do and frames NATO's adoption of UNSCR 1325 as
a means to bolster perceptions of NATO. Second, it goes against the
intentions of the feminist activists who supported the realisation of
UNSCR 1325 in the Security Council, with the Resolution intended to
challenge, rather than support the militarism NATO embodies (see
discussion in Chapter 1). The alliance has a track record of
instrumentalising gendered narratives, and specifically targeting women.
For example, the use of symbols of women's liberation to demonstrate the
superiority of Western countries during the Cold War]{.underline}
(Risso, 2009: 509). [More recently and following the adoption of the
2011 NATO/EAPC Policy, the alliance's showcase digital diplomacy
initiative to commemorate the draw-down of NATO-led forces from
Afghanistan in 2014, titled Return to Hope, instrumentalised Afghan
women to 'sell' NATO's intervention to publics back home. The narratives
included also supported a very particular gender understanding of the
intervention and were underpinned by a masculinist protection
logic]{.underline} (Wright, 2019: 10). At the same time as NATO had
publicly committed to integrating WPS concerns into public diplomacy, a
core part of the agenda being the better representation of women, we see
women marginalised from a key public diplomacy initiative (Wright, 2019:
11). The 2011 NATO/EAPC Policy also endorses national initiatives to
promote women's participation their armed forces. This situates UNSCR
1325 within NATO's long-established concern with the status of women in
NATO Forces, formalised in the recognition of the CWINF in 1976 and
discussed in Chapter 4. [Some feminist advocates of WPS have been
critical of this association, critiquing the motivation as stemming not
from NATO's support for gender equality, but to support pre-existing
objectives to modernise and professionalise NATO Forces]{.underline}
(Cockburn, 2011). Three years later, the 2014 NATO/EAPC Policy
represented a significant development in NATO's approach to WPS. This
was reflected in the creation of the of Secretary General's Special
Representative on WPS in 2012 who became the figurehead for NATO's
engagement with WPS (discussed below). Most pertinently, there is a
shift away from the emphasis in previous policies on the 'added value'
of UNSCR 1325 to bolster NATO's existing agendas, to a focus on how NATO
can support the broader WPS agenda. For example, the implementation of
UNSCR 1325 is framed 'within the context of NATO's wider policy
objectives core tasks', rather than as an add-on. The policy also
applies for the first time to NATO's own human resource policies
(civilian and military), stating that 'gender balance within our
institutions is a goal in itself, and is also a means for improving
performance' (NATO, 2014a). In addition, the monitoring and reporting
mechanisms are also strengthened and provide greater transparency to
enable outside scrutiny of NATO's implementation of UNSCR 1325, with the
NATO/EAPC Action Plan being released publicly for the first time (see
discussion below). The latest iteration of the NATO/EAPC Policy was
released in autumn 2018. It is the first revision of the policy to have
been formally consulted on with external actors through the Civil
Society Advisory Panel (CSAP) established formally in 2016 (NATO,
2016a). NATO has previously been an outlier among international
institutions because it has had no formal mechanisms to consult civil
society in the policy-making process. CSAP therefore represents a
significant change. [The 2018 NATO/EAPC Policy also calls for NATO to
develop 'specific mechanisms to prevent and respond to SEA' because 'it
causes disproportionate harm to women and girls and undermines NATO's
credibility and operational']{.underline} (NATO/EAPC, 2018). This is a
significant development and could be an example of NATO seeking to
reflect on how WPS relates to its own structures and practices. NATO
Action Plans on UNSCR 1325 [Beyond policy commitment, the actual
implementation of the NATO/EAPC Policies on UNSCR 1325 has remained a
key challenge for NATO]{.underline}. To support this, NATO has mobilised
corresponding action plans with practical tasks assigned to
institutional actors. In 2010, the first Action Plan was adopted by the
NAC (Oudraat et al., 2015: 5), and was intended 'to provide an overall
framework for NATO's practical implementation of the Resolutions with
its Partners' (NATO, 2011). This is referenced in the 2011 revision of
the NATO/EAPC Policy, which includes provision for monitoring and
accountability mechanisms. The stakeholders involved in the Action Plan
are the International Staff, IMS, NATO Military Authorities, and member
and partner states. However, this is all the information available on
this version of the implementation plan because it remained classified
due to the sensitive and operation-specific information it contained
(NATO Official, 2014). This meant it was not a document which could be
used to hold NATO to account for its implementation of the WPS agenda.
Since the NATO/EAPC Policy was revised in 2014, the accompanying Action
Plan has been made public and also included Afghanistan, Australia,
Japan, Jordan, New Zealand, and the United Arab Emirates (Oudraat et
al., 2015: 5). This increased transparency is welcome and brings NATO
into line with the global approach to WPS which has seen 79 states adopt
public-facing National Action Plans (PeaceWomen, 20184). However, it is
far from practical for an international security institution, where,
particularly in regards to operations, a level of secrecy is necessary.
For practical reasons in certain areas, NATO Officials may therefore
need to develop an additional classified and more detailed action plan
(NATO Official, 2014). [On the surface, the 2016 NATO/EAPC Action Plan
seems to support the increased representation of women in
NATO]{.underline}. One of the core outcomes is the 'improved gender
balance at all levels at NATO allies and partners' defence and security
institutions'. [Yet, if we dig a little deeper into this statement, we
find it omits mention of the representation of women within the
International Staff or IMS. So, while increasing the representation of
women in allies' own forces, if realised, is likely to have some
trickle-down impact on gender balance within delegations to NATO and
staff seconded from member and partner states, it will not address the
gender imbalance among those employed directly by the
alliance.]{.underline} The gender imbalance within NATO should be a
pressing issue for the alliance given its stated commitment to the WPS
agenda. The 2018 NATO/EAPC Action Plan seems to offer a significant
development then. It commits NATO under its pillar of 'inclusiveness' to
'Map the obstacles and implement activities to increase the number of
women in NATO, especially in leadership roles' (NATO/ EAPC, 2018). [Yet
NATO has not released figures on gender balance at NATO HQ since 2012,
an important part of achieving this aim is to provide transparency and
therefore accountability on this issue. This indicates it is not a high
priority for NATO and therefore an issue with considerable political
sensitivities among the allies.]{.underline}

[The conclusion is that -- as NATO goes global, women are a critical
asset for NATO's new missions....]{.underline} Particularly in certain
cultural contexts, like in Afghanistan, female troops and mixed-gender
units are essential toGendering NATO's core tasks 113 carrying out such
tasks as house searches, or establishing ties with the local population.
As former CWINF Chair, Lieutenant Colonel Kristin Lund draws attention
to above, as NATO became a crisis management organisation, military
women became essential operational assets (NATO, 2004). [NATO defines
crisis management as 'military and non-military measures to address the
full spectrum of crisis -- before, during and after
conflicts'.]{.underline} Three years before NATO produced a policy on
WPS, the 2004 CWINF conference outcomes included a call for the greater
involvement of women in NATO militaries as 'force multipliers' (NATO,
2004). So, while NATO's later engagement with UNSCR 1325, WPS and a
gender perspective (as discussed in Chapter 5) would further articulate
the 'added value' of women, WPS did not provide the impetus. Rather, WPS
has mapped onto NATO's pre-existing concern with women and in NATO
Forces, and NATO's involvement in Afghanistan. NATO's involvement in
Afghanistan came in December 2001 with the creation of the ISAF. This
was to become NATO's largest and most challenging crisis management
operation to-date. Until the draw-down of forces December 2014, over 51
states drawn from NATO members and partners contributed to the mission
(NATO, 2018). [The complexities of the conflict saw gender (or women)
become central to Western understandings of Afghanistan (Daulatzai,
2008) and shaped NATO's subsequent engagement with the WPS agenda
(Wright, 2016: 356). Gender, or specifically women, became beneficial
not just in rhetorical justifications for the action, but in both
doctrine and practice to population-centric counterinsurgency (Dyvik,
2013: 412). For example, the gendering of counterinsurgency through the
use of FETs became part of efforts to sell the intervention to a
war-fatigued audience framing it as a 'gentler (feminine)
option']{.underline} (Mcbride and Wibben, 2012: 200). We return to this
when we discuss the gender perspective 'in action' in Chapter 5. FETs
are far from representative of the experience of women in NATO Forces.
Nevertheless, FETs captured the imaginaries of the media and broader
public, as this Daily Mail headline exemplifies: 'The British Army's
secret weapon in Afghanistan? It's the seven female officers in Helmand
Province gaining the trust of the locals' (Daily Mail, 2012). FETs have
also caught the attention of NATO, for example, the NCGP has continued
to address the issue at conferences, despite their decreasing use (e.g.
in 2004, 2018). Academia has also become fixated upon FETs, contributing
to their exceptionalising, and leading the Navy War College in a call
for papers for its regular academic conference on WPS to ban papers
addressing them (US Naval War College, 2018). [In operations, including
in Afghanistan, FETs have been used to engage and 'win over' local
women, or the half of the population out of reach to male
soldiers]{.underline}. They were developed by the UK, US and others.
However, ISAF forces also formed informal FETs drawn from 'tactical and
provincial reconstruction teams, civil affairs forces and agribusiness
development teams' (Holliday, 2012). Despite this, many of these efforts
remained 'ad hoc and disorganized and114 Gendering NATO's core tasks
training and employment are not standardized' (Holliday, 2012). This is
reinforced through the reflections of a former FET deployed in
Afghanistan: 'I couldn't do anything for them,' my medic told me. And I
responded, 'Neither could I.' We were tourists, unable to solve problems
with units that changed every 12 months. Everything was temporary,
except Afghanistan. Although we did other programmatic work like
husbandry training and a literacy program, none were sustainable. Where
there were few roads and doctors, we attempted to hand out pudding and
toothpaste. When the next team came to replace us, their commander
refused to conduct FET missions. (Ricks, 2016) [Centralising gender in
our analysis of FETs as a crisis management tool points to some of the
broader implications of their use. As Mcbride and Wibben (2012: 211)
found in their study of FETs, there was an irony that 'their
effectiveness is limited more by U.S. commanders than patriarchal
Afghans', leading them to question just 'who is shielding their women
from Afghan society more: Pashtun men or U.S. Commanders?'. Ultimately
the deployment of FETs mobilised as a counterinsurgency tool rested on
gendered and racialised logics]{.underline}. This is what Spivak
originally articulated as 'white men saving brown women from brown men'
(Spivak quoted in Cooke, 2002). [Here, this problematic reasoning has
morphed to become 'white women saving brown women from brown
men']{.underline} (Cooke, 2002; Mcbride and Wibben, 2012). [Gender and
security in Afghanistan have been understood within a masculinist
protection logic]{.underline} (Partis-Jennings, 2017: 414). As we argue
in Chapter 1, a core part of NATO's role as an institution of
international hegemonic masculinity is the projection of a masculinist
protection role. [Gendered norms become apparent when women join the
military. This occurs as the 'women soldiers' subjectivity is formed
against the norms of masculinity embedded in the
organisation']{.underline} (Kronsell, 2012: 43). The increasing presence
of women in the military therefore has the potential to be 'disruptive'
(Duncanson and Woodward, 2016: 12). [Military women can be disruptive in
the sense that their mere presence means the institution is no longer
exclusively occupied by men's bodies.]{.underline} But also in the sense
that the perspective and presence of these women disrupt the masculine
norms that pervade such institutions. The presence of women challenges
the naturalness and invisibility of masculine norms; the relational
nature of gender and the dominance of masculinity are therefore exposed.
[The use of women soldiers in FET roles brings this disruptive potential
into question. In addition to their symbolism, FETs frame women as of
'added value' to the military, thus separating them from the homogenous
military whole. Their use therefore is a potential obstacle to women
into the military presenting a 'disruption' to established gender
hierarchies and structures]{.underline}. For example, the foundation of
military training is to strip a recruit's individuality from them,
making them an obedient part of the military whole and able to respond
to command structures (Whitworth, 2004: 158). [Adding women because they
are perceived to bring something different is problematic because it
accentuates difference and rests upon the premise that the 'different'
individuals can, and will, provide the diversity expected of them
(Kronsell, 2012: 67). In so doing, the existing majority is normalised
and constructed 'as homogenous and naturally associated with the
organization' (Kronsell, 2012: 67). Far from challenging the hegemonic
masculinity militarism is built upon, the diversity argument reinforces
an essentialist view of women as in opposition to the norm (Whitworth,
2004: 154). It also contradicts the foundation of military training,
whereby recruit's individuality is stripped from them so that they
become part of an obedient military whole able to respond to command
structures (Whitworth, 2004: 158). The use of FETs fits a wider pattern
of the recruitment of military women, where they are often assigned to
particular, often times subordinate, roles (Mathers, 2013:
134).]{.underline}

### Negative Peace

#### The realist conception of "negative peace" leaves much to be desired -- the aff's flawed approach to containing conflict perpetuates the gendered status-quo and excludes non-state actors

achieving resolution]{.underline}**.18 These **[focus]{.underline}**
narrowly **[on]{.underline}** managing conflict situations and
**[achieving 'negative peace']{.underline}**19 by halting overt
violence. **[The aim is to reinforce international order and security by
'isolating' and 'containing' conflict.]{.underline}**20 [There is shared
agreement between critical and feminist PCS regarding the inadequacies
of conflict management]{.underline} approaches [for building sustainable
peace.]{.underline} **[Traditional peacekeeping missions]{.underline}**,
for example, **[hold a mixed record in limiting armed conflict, and are
'virtually uniform' in their failure to achieve conflict
resolution.]{.underline}**21 **[They rarely created]{.underline}** the
**[conditions for peace, and worked]{.underline}** largely **[to
'freeze' rather than resolve conflict.]{.underline}**22 **[Women and
gender issues were largely excluded]{.underline}** from traditional
peacekeeping missions: [for instance, between 1957 and 1989, the number
of women participating in the military component of peacekeeping
missions was]{.underline} a mere [0.1%.]{.underline}23 Furthermore, the
**[coercive power wielded by armed peacekeepers is
criticised]{.underline}** by feminists -- **[for reproducing violent
masculinities which (re)create gendered forms of
insecurity,]{.underline}**24 **[and for perpetuating relations of
domination which are at the root of violent conflict.]{.underline}**25
**[Traditional diplomacy]{.underline}**, meanwhile, frequently

conflict.]{.underline}**26 **[Feminist scholars have documented the
long-standing absence of women from]{.underline}** formal **[peace
negotiations.]{.underline}**27 [Obstacles include highly gendered norms
and practices of diplomacy, which associate negotiations and mediation

relatively 'powerless' non-state actors, including]{.underline}** many
**[women, girls, and non-binary people.]{.underline}**30 Furthermore,

### Rational Actors

#### The aff perpetuates gendered hierarchy by depicting Western countries as "rational" actors which dictate which weapons are justified and who gets to wield them -- this legitimates military spending and programs which fuel warfare 

**Cohn 3 --** PhD from The Union Graduate School, director of the
Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights at the University of
Massachusetts**.** \[Carol, "A Feminist Ethical Perspective on Weapons
of Mass Destruction", 2003,
[https://genderandsecurity.org/sites/default/files/Cohn_Ruddick\_-\_Femst_Ethical_Perspective_on_WMDs.pdf\]//AV](https://genderandsecurity.org/sites/default/files/Cohn_Ruddick_-_Femst_Ethical_Perspective_on_WMDs.pdf%5d//AV)

Thus, [use of the term "proliferation" tends to locate the person who
uses it within a possessor state, and aligns him or her with the
political stance favoring the hierarchy of state power enshrined in the
current distribution of WMD]{.underline}. The framing of Question Four.
"\... [is it proper to deny \[WMD\] possession to others for the same
purposes?", seems similarly based in a possessor state perspective, as
it is presumably the possessor states who must decide whether it is
proper to deny possession to others]{.underline}. As we have already
stated, [we find WMD themselves intrinsically morally indefensible, no
matter who possesses them,]{.underline} and we are concerned about the
wide array of costs to any state of development and deployment. **[We
therefore reject the discourse's implicit division of "good" and "bad,"
"safe" and "unsafe" WMD, (defined as good or bad depending on who
possesses them).]{.underline}** [Our concern is to understand how some
WMD are rendered invisible ("o urs") and some visible ("theirs"); some
rendered malignant and others benign.]{.underline} Here, we join others
in noting that the language in which the case against "proliferation" is
made is ethno-racist and contemptuous. Generally, in **[Western
proliferation discourse as a whole, a distinction is drawn between "the
'Self'(seen as responsible) vs the non-Western Unruly
Other."]{.underline}** 36 [**The US represents itself as a rational
actor, while representing the Unruly Other as emotional, unpredictable,
irrational, immature, misbehaving**. Not only does this draw on and
reconstruct an Orientalist portrayal of third world actors]{.underline}
37; [**it does so through the medium of gendered terminology. By drawing
the relations between possessors and non-possessors in gendered terms --
the prudential, rational, advanced, mature, restrained, technologically-
and bureaucratically- competent (and thus "masculine") Self, versus the
emotional, irrational, unpredictable, uncontrolled, immature, primitive,
undisciplined, technologically-incompetent (and thus "feminine") Unruly
Other -- the discourse naturalizes and legitimates the Self/possessor
states having weapons which the Other does not.** By drawing on and
evoking gendered imagery and resonances, the discourse naturalizes the
idea that "We" / the US / the responsible father must protect, must
control and limit "her," the emotional, out-of-control state, for her
own good, as well as for ours]{.underline}. [This Western proliferation
discourse has had a function in the wider context of US national
security politics]{.underline}. With the end of the "Evil Empire" in the
late 1980s, until the attacks of September 11th , 2001, the US appeared
to be without an enemy of grand enough proportions to justify
maintaining its sprawling military-industrial establishment. [This
difficulty was forestalled by the construction of the category of "rogue
states" -- states seen as uncontrollable, irresponsible, irrational,
malevolent, and antagonistic to the West.]{.underline} 38 [Their
unruliness and antagonism was represented as intrinsic to their
irrational nature]{.underline}; if it were not in their "nature," the US
would have needed to ask more seriously if actions on the part of the
West had had any role in producing that hostility and
disorder[.]{.underline} **[The discourse of WMD proliferation has been
one of the principal means of producing these states as major
threats.]{.underline}** To say this is neither to back away from our
position opposing weapons of mass destruction, nor to assess the degree
to which WMD in the hands of "Other" states actually do threaten the US,
the "Other" states' regional opponents, or their own population. But it
is an assessment of the role of [WMD proliferation
discourse]{.underline} in **[naturalizing and legitimating
otherwise-difficult-to-make-appear-rational programs and expenditures
such as National Missile Defense]{.underline}**. 39 [**Within the logic
of deterrence theory and proliferation discourse, the phenomenon of WMD
proliferation is understandable in two main ways.** States either
acquire WMD for purposes of aggression -- i.e., to use WMD or to
threaten their use in acts of aggression, intimidation and/or coercion
against other states or populations within their own state. Or states
acquire WMD to enhance their own security by deterring an opponent from
attack. **Within a strategic calculus, either is understood as a
"rational" motivation for WMD possession, even if not everyone would
view these reasons as equally morally defensible.**]{.underline}

### Russia-Ukraine

#### The 'realpolitik' of the 1AC elides feminist analysis of Russia's invasion in Ukraine and continues the exclusion of feminist discourse from NATO

University. "A feminist perspective on the Russian-Ukraine War:
Implications for NATO." Centre for Women, Peace, and Security. 3/8/2022.

[Russia's intervention in Ukraine seemingly caught the international
community and many International Relations scholars by surprise. It has
been heralded as a return to 'realpolitik' leading to a (re)focus on the
state as the primary referent point of international politics. Yet while
feminist IR scholars have made important inroads into the discipline in
recent decades, demonstrating how the personal is not only political but
international too, at this time of crisis we again find feminist
insights marginalised from mainstream discussion of the war and its
consequences (with a few notable exceptions, including work by Jenny
Mathers and a subsequently postponed RUSI event).]{.underline} Feminists
IR scholars have much value to add to the discussion to aide our
understanding of the war and its gendered impact. [For example, how
masculinities and femininities are invoked in constructing Russia and
Ukraine in geopolitical imaginaries, the absence of women from both
Ukranian and Russian negotiation delegations, or in the gendered
silences of just who is seen to fight/be protected in Western media
coverage, to name just a few of examples]{.underline}. However, the
purpose of this blog is to focus on the implications of the war for NATO
through a feminist lens. [Feminist IR scholars' primary concern with
NATO stems from a premise that it functions as an institution of
international hegemonic masculinity. This has included a focus on how
NATO shares lessons on the value of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS)
agenda and a gender perspective, constituting both through a militarist
lens, even if gender work often remains under resourced and not fully
utilised within the alliance and its operations.]{.underline} Feminist
IR scholars have also examined how gendered narratives are invoked to
shape NATO, its value, and purpose, both internally through storytelling
and the interactions of 'gendermen' (and women) and externally through
the projection and reception of strategic narratives. The value of
women, and more recently gender perspectives, to the alliance is nothing
new and NATO has long been concerned with the integration of women into
its armed forces in relation to balancing 'manpower' shortages and
supporting operational effectiveness. More recently, in 2019, NATO
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that "Gender equality is an
integral part of all NATO policies, programmes and Projects." Likewise,
the NATO/EAPC Policy and Action Plan on WPS makes it clear that "NATO
aims to address gender inequality and integrate WPS through the
Alliance's three core tasks of collective defence, crisis management and
cooperative security \[emphasis author's own\]". Even if 'nations have
the primary responsibility' in respect to collective defence, it is
these nations which makeup NATO and agree its response, they are
therefore responsible for ensuring "the provision of trained troops and
experts on gender issues, as well as a better gender balance in NATO-led
forces depend entirely on national decisions". The NATO WPS policy has
"encouraged \[member and partner states\] to make WPS an integral part
of their defence and security." The test of whether they have or not
comes now. [Despite such a commitment, we have yet to see NATO, or its
members or partners, articulate the relevance of gender in their
response to the Russian intervention in Ukraine]{.underline}. While
there remains a lot we don't know about NATO's reaction, we would
expect, if it were in place, for NATO to have made the case for the
relevance of a gender perspective publicly. [If the response to Russia's
actions has seen NATO return to its Article 5 collective defence
founding purpose, it has also, yet again, drawn attention to the
disjuncture between the rhetoric and reality of NATO's commitment to the
WPS agenda. This also further undermines and demonstrates the hollowness
of recent calls for NATO to adopt a Feminist Foreign
Policy.]{.underline} As feminist IR scholars, we should be asking not
only where are the women but where are the gender advisors and where is
the gender expertise? Is the NATO Special Representative on Women, Peace
and Security being included in all high-level discussions? Are Gender
Advisors being deployed with the NATO Response Forces? Has a gender
perspective been incorporated into NATO's strategic communications? Is a
gender perspective being included in all decision-making processes? Has
a gender perspective been part of the briefings at the NATO
extraordinary meetings on Ukraine? Which (if any) member and partners
states (including those with Feminist Foreign Policies, such as Canada,
France, Germany, Sweden, Luxembourg and Sweden) are raising NATO's
commitments under WPS as something to be taken into consideration at
these meetings? And what gender expertise are they contributing
substantively? Moreover, given in the last decade NATO has begun
engaging civil society formally on its WPS work, we must ask where are
their voices and perspectives now? This short contribution has sought to
raise questions and provocations related to the WPS agenda and how it
has (or hasn't) been invoked in NATO's response to the Russia-Ukraine
War. [It has also demonstrated that feminist knowledge and attention to
NATO is needed now more than ever.]{.underline} It is just one take, and
there remains more than one feminist perspective on NATO, while feminism
remains a broad school, even if feminist IR scholars remain united by a
commitment to emancipatory praxis. [It has shown how, even at times such
as these, we need to make space to hear voices outside of the mainstream
discourse, which might make us uncomfortable or challenge the accepted
status quo, because doing so keeps alive the possibility that another
world is possible. Asking feminist questions of NATO specifically can
contribute to a better understanding of the alliance's role in the
global power order, in particular how it engages with and shapes 'new'
security threats, including the Russian intervention in
Ukraine.]{.underline}

[Militaries are viewed by many feminist scholars as fundamentally
inimical to feminism, institutions of destructive power and inherent
misogyny.13 Militaries perpetrate devastating violence in war, which
disproportionately affects women when the long term impacts, including
of forced migration, and sexual and gender-based violence are
considered.14 Even where described as 'pacifying' or 'liberating'
missions, military interventions remain violent, for some feminists,
often 'wars of extraction'15, involving the logic of all war:
'opposition, differentiation and the othering of peoples'.16 As well as
perpetrating direct physical violence, militaries are implicated in
equally pernicious structural violence. States' military-industrial
complexes organize economies around producing weapons rather than
civilian goods and absorb vast amounts of funding that could otherwise
be spent on achieving human security.17]{.underline} The Women's
International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) highlights the
opportunity-costs at play: the world's total military expenditure in
2013 was estimated to be \$1.747 trillion.18 Only a small fraction of
that would be required to fund the measures to achieve the Millennium
Development Goal for gender equality, such as women's economic
empowerment, family planning, and women's participation and leadership.
[A feminist vision of peace and security, as articulated by WILPF and
reflected in feminist scholarship, is for 'a world free from violence
and armed conflict in which human rights are protected and women and men
are equally empowered and involved in positions of leadership at the
local, national and international levels', hand in hand with universal
reduction and elimination of weapons,19 suggesting a vastly reduced (if
any) role for armed forces and military alliances. Militaries are,
moreover, viewed by many feminists as an institution where hegemonic
forms of masculinity privileging practices of violence and misogyny,
combined with myths of heroic protection of vulnerable civilians, are
produced and reproduced.20 Militarized masculinity, constructed within
militaries but with effects rippling through society, is theorized as
focused upon domination of women (and subordinate males) and the
denigration of the feminine.21 Indeed, many scholars argue that the
capacity of women within the military to be agents of change of
institutional culture or of military operations is limited, as they
adapt their performance of femininity to fit their hyper-masculine
environment.22]{.underline} They likewise question claims that women
make a distinct contribution as military peacekeepers: to protection of
women and girls, prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, or as role
models for local women.23 [As Heineken says, 'Clearly one cannot bring
about a different perspective to war and peace if women \[in the
military\] are expected to embrace masculine norms and values and where
gender difference is not recognised and valued'.24]{.underline} As such,
it is unsurprising that some feminist scholars and activists are
sceptical of military engagement with the Women, Peace and Security
agenda. [They suggest that when taken up by militaries, the Women, Peace
and Security agenda risks being used to lend legitimacy to the 'war
system' rather than challenge it,25 even 'militarizing
feminism'.26]{.underline} NATO is regarded with particular suspicion, by
'Women Against NATO', as 'an ambitious, expansionist and belligerent
war-machine, primarily serving the economic and strategic interests of
the more powerful among its member states'.27 [From this perspective,
NATO invoking women's rights is not progress, but the co-optation of
feminism for militarist ends. More specifically, some feminists allege
that NATO's gender work too often carries the implication that gender is
only relevant for the host country, as if western institutions had
achieved gender equality; that it perpetuates colonial assumptions about
the superiority of the west as the bearer of civilization and
humanitarian values.28 One imagines that anti-militarist feminists would
argue that Military Gender Advisors are either not-feminist or feminists
wasting their time, legitimizing fundamentally problematic
institutions.]{.underline}

There's nothing ground-breaking about my response -- it repeats things
feminists have been saying for decades. [It suggests that seeing the US
government as the location of relevance may be not only wrong but
morally insidious, then makes the argument that the notion of objective
knowledge and scientific process that Desch shares with the quantitative
work he criticizes might be the root of a differently understood
'relevance problem' for Security Studies -- hierarchy and exclusion.
Even though this response is, in my view, strikingly unoriginal -- it
seems to be getting the same reaction it got 20 years ago.]{.underline}
Desch was able to write a response to the response -- well, a response
to other people's responses anyway. All of the other pieces (including
the other two in the sentence below) are addressed substantively. My
piece is mentioned in one sentence. Brace yourself. "Finally, Tutton,
Voeten, and Laura Sjoberg all make an important point about
policy-relevance involving much more than government policy-makers."
Yep. That's it. [I say: gender analysis shows your conception of
Security Studies is normatively harmful and intellectually
counterproductive. He says: oh, nice of you to tell me that we need to
pay attention to policy-making outside of government. I meant that, I
just didn't say it. But my catch-all point applies to that. In other
words, I know there's stuff I didn't talk about, and that's enough to
dispense with the gender critique.]{.underline} My colleagues from
outside of the United States often wonder why I engage with the American
mainstream of IR, and, when I first read Desch's response to the
response, I'll admit, I got on the skeptical bandwagon. But then I
thought -- that response is exactly why it has to keep getting said.
There, and then here, and then anyplace else that it can be. [Gender
analysis is not just something you mean but don't say, and then can get
away with saying "I know there's stuff I didn't talk about." It affects
how you think about a project, ontologically, epistemology, and
methodologically. It affects it whether or not you think so -- your work
is as impacted by implicit masculinized gender assumptions as mine is by
explicit feminist assumptions.]{.underline} And I'm talking about it
even if you won't.

### A2 Perm -- NATO Has Gender Policy

#### Despite rhetoric geared towards gender equality, NATO continues to be a male-dominated organization---no reason the aff's specific example of a gender-centered policy matters

[For all of NATO's rhetoric about engaging in a \"continuous process of
reform, modernisation and transformation,\" the composition of its top
leadership looks downright anachronistic.]{.underline} With the March 28
designation of Jens Stoltenberg as the next secretary general, it seems
certain that at least 70 years will pass without a single woman serving
at the very top of the organization. [The problem is not confined to the
position of secretary-general. In 65 years, there has also never been a
female deputy secretary-general, and Croatia's Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic
is the first and only woman to ever serve in one of the assistant
secretary-general positions.]{.underline} Unsurprisingly, the imbalance
is every bit as pronounced within the military delegations to NATO.
There has never been a female supreme allied commander Europe, and all
of its 56 current chiefs of defense and military representatives are
male. Its organizational chart of top civilian and military leaders
shows 80 men and three women smiling gamely at the camera. [Individual
member states, meanwhile, are increasingly sending women to top
positions within their own governments, outpacing NATO in the slog
toward gender equality.]{.underline} At the moment, eight of the
alliance's 28 member states have at least one woman representing the
country's security and foreign-policy priorities in Brussels or serving
as a defense minister, and over half of its members have or have
previously had a female head of government. [As senior stateswomen with
expertise in collective defense, many of these women are qualified
candidates for NATO leadership positions, yet they are not making it to
that top echelon. There are doubtlessly those who question whether a
gender imbalance even matters, particularly in a defense-oriented
organization]{.underline}. Given the alliance's challenging agenda, from
countering Russian President Vladimir Putin's aggression to making the
most with increasingly strained military resources, the composition of
its leadership may seem like an auxiliary concern. In fact, the types of
challenges with which NATO contends would especially benefit from more
representative leadership. [Ample research suggests that female
leadership brings about positive change for organizations, particularly
in the domain of conflict resolution. Women leaders have been shown to
have a more democratic and collaborative leadership style --- an
important attribute when trying to build consensus in a large
organization such as NATO. When women play an active role in discussions
about post-conflict reconstruction, research has shown that the
resultant peace agreements and operational policies are less likely to
marginalize parts of society and more likely to endure. Recent
literature about women in the private sector has hailed the diversity of
perspective and problem-solving techniques that women bring --- surely
those same benefits also apply in the context of the
alliance]{.underline}. At a time when NATO is trying to address
21st-century challenges without slipping back into a 20th-century
mindset, more diversity at the top could go a long way toward keeping
the organization and its thinking modern. [Beyond these practical
benefits, the other reason that increasing the number of women in top
NATO positions matters is, quite simply, a question of values: A
collective security organization that only represents 50 percent of the
population in top leadership jobs is inconsistent with the contemporary
Western values the alliance espouses.]{.underline}

The realisation of UNCR 1325 was premised on a network of actors working
both within UN structures and outside. Importantly, civil society were
present through the NGO Working Group on WPS, an umbrella organisation
which brought together interested NGOs to lobby for, draft and redraft
the final Resolution (Hill, Aboitiz and Poehlman-Doumbouya, 2009:
1258--60). [They envisaged the transformative potential of UNSCR 1325
not as a tool to 'make war safe for women', but through acknowledging
the different and disproportionate impact on women, and women's role in
conflict prevention and resolution]{.underline} (Cook, 2009: 126). The
role of feminists, including those working through the NGO Working Group
on WPS, meant UNSCR 1325 was championed as a 'feminist achievement'
(Cockburn, 2011). Some later went onto question whether the Resolution
was a 'trick or treat', arguing that despite some weaknesses, it should
be seen as a new global gender norm in the making (Tryggestad, 2009:
552). [More recently, and despite some progress in the adoption of
National Action Plans (NAPs) to support the implementation of WPS, a
growing cynicism has emerged in relation to its transformative
potential]{.underline} (Duncanson and Woodward, 2015: 8). Member states,
civil society, academics and critical actors within the UN itself were
critical to the realisation of the Resolution. The formation of such a
coalition of interested parties working together at the Security Council
was unprecedented (Cockburn, 2011). [Despite this, the politics of the
Security Council meant certain compromises were necessary to realise the
Resolution. This has resulted in silences and omission within the WPS
agenda more broadly. It remains unclear if the lack of 'feminist'
conceptualisations in policy can be attributed to a knowledge gap among
those formulating policy]{.underline} (Cook, 2016: 22). [Rather, given
the diversity of the coalition supporting UNSCR 1325 it could be that
even those fully equipped with sufficient understanding may struggle to
get such language adopted because of wider institutional pressures or
specific resista]{.underline}nce (Cook, 2016: 22). For example, the NGO
Working Group on WPS had feminist and anti-war members but they were not
in the majority, there was therefore a lack of consensus on the extent
to which UNSCR 1325 should challenge existing practices (Cohn, 2011:
12[). As a result any discussion of the arms trade and militarism was
off the agenda because some members found the topics 'too
political']{.underline} (Cohn, 2011: 12). As a result, there is an
absence from UNSCR 1325 of the Security Council's own responsibility
within the UN Charter to support the establishment of arms regulations
systems (Otto, 2004: 12). Another key silence is any mention of ending
war, despite this being a foundational part of the Security Council's
brief (Cockburn, 2007: 147). [These omissions and silences draw
attention to the contradiction between the Security Council with an
implicit support for a militarised interstate system, and the normative
underpinnings of UNSCR 1325 on women in armed conflict.]{.underline} As
Basu (2010: 289) argues, this dissonance has emerged precisely because
of the challenges to women's security which result from the current
set-up of the international arena. The language of the WPS resolutions
is also worth considering. UNSCR 1325 relies on comparatively weak
language for a Security Council Resolution. [This includes the
repetition of 'urges', 'encourages' and 'calls', rather than stronger
language demanding action from states]{.underline} (Tryggestad, 2009:
544). [It also associated 'gender' with 'women', which means the calls
for gender mainstreaming can be read as only applicable to the concerns
of women. Gender is therefore transformed into a 'safe idea' for policy
makers leaving behind its radical potential to produce change
(Puechguirbal, 2010: 184). Gender also comes to signify a
'need/want/lack' (Shepherd, 2011: 515, 2008: 171--2). UNSCR 1325 also
presents a victim-agent dichotomy. The Resolution frames women both as
having 'special needs' and in need of protection in conflict situations,
but also as agents 'stressing the importance of their equal
participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance
and promotion of peace and security']{.underline} (United Nations
Security Council, 2000). For some, there is no contradiction here and it
is possible to acknowledge both the disproportionate impact of war on
women, while still 'making women's agency vibrantly visible' (Cohn,
Kinsella and Gibbings, 2004: 139). For others, the language of the
Resolution has missed an opportunity to challenge myths that sustain
beliefs about women's helplessness in the face of sexual violence by
also acknowledging their capacity to be agents of change (Otto, 2010:
117). UNSCR 1820 presents something of a shift away from this
victim-agent understanding, and while UNSCR 1888 returns to the dual
track approach, it does refer to civilians as victims of
Conflict-Related Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (CRSGBV), rather than
women specifically (Shepherd, 2011). The passage of the WPS Resolutions
through the Security Council has not always followed the same pattern as
UNSCR 1325. In 2009 the next WPS Resolution, UNSCR 1820, was initiated
by the US State Department, rather than civil society advocacy, and
designed to complement the Bush Administration's antitrafficking agenda
(Otto, 2010: 109[). However, the draft of the Resolution was leaked to
NGOs who sought to respond critically in attempt to tone down the focus
on women as powerless and vulnerable victims]{.underline} (Otto, 2010:
109). Unsurprisingly, UNSCR 1820 received a mixed reception from
scholars and activists. Some welcomed it as a long overdue engagement by
the Security Council with CRSGBV. Others criticised the resolution for
reducing the broad scope of UNSCR 1325 and holistic nature of the WPS
agenda to the issue of women as victims of war (Otto, 2010: 101; Cook,
2009b). [In treating CRSGBV as a separate issue from violence against
women in peacetime, there is a danger that the latter become normalised.
Further, sensationalising sexual violence in war may reinforce the
beliefs which make rape a powerful weapon of war (Cook, 2009b:48 The
long view 129; Meger, 2016). Sam Cook (2009b: 129) argues that it is
necessary to question the idea that experiencing sexual violence in
conflict is the very worst thing that can happen to a woman and is
unrecoverable from. This reinforces the notion that raping a woman in
war is equivalent to 'raping a nation', with women seen as a resource,
and closes down avenues to ending violence]{.underline} (Cook, 2009b:
129). The third WPS Resolution, UNSCR 1888 adopted in 2009, also
addressed the issue of CRSGBV and was again sponsored by the US.
However, the Obama administration sought to break from the Bush legacy
on the issue (Otto, 2010: 110). The Resolution made a significant
departure from UNSCR 1820 by treating the issue of CRSGBV as one of
structural inequality, not women's inherent vulnerability (Otto, 2010:
103). Five days after the adoption of UNSCR 1888, Vietnam sponsored the
adoption of UNSCR 1889. The fourth WPS Resolution returned the focus of
the WPS agenda to women's participation, reinforcing and strengthening
the provisions of UNSCR 1325 with measures to address women's structural
inequalities. UNSCR 1889 joined UNSCR 1325 in introducing new language
acknowledging women as agents and displacing representations of women as
victims (Otto, 2010: 103). In 2010, the adoption of UNSCR 1960 created a
set of institutional tools to combat impunity and steps towards the
prevention and protection from CRSGBV. Two further WPS Resolutions were
passed by the Security Council in 2013: UNSCR 2016; and UNSCR 2122.
[UNSCR 2106, adopted in June, was proposed by the UK as part of their
Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative (PSVI) and became the
fourth resolution to focus on CRSGBV. As a result there was again
concern that the WPS agenda had narrowed to focus on CRSGBV at the
expense of women's participation]{.underline} (Krause and Enloe, 2015:
329). The adoption of UNSCR 2122 in 2013, which acknowledged the salient
role women do and should play in contributing towards sustainable peace,
was therefore significant because it represented the return of the WPS
agenda to its wider and more comprehensive origins (Björkdahl and
Mannergren Selimovic, 2015: 20). The Resolution also embodies the
strongest language on women's agency of all the WPS Resolutions (Miller,
Pournik and Swaine, 2014: 51). The penultimate WPS Resolution, UNSCR
2122's focus on monitoring the implementation of the WPS agenda through
increased briefings to the Security Council from various UN entities,
represented a radical departure from previous WPS Resolutions (Shepherd,
2014: 22). The Resolution called on member states, regional actors and
UN entities to review their existing implementation of the WPS agenda
and revise existing targets in preparation for the High-Level Review
mandated by the Resolution in 2015. In addition, the Secretary General
commissioned a Global Study led by Radhika Coomaraswamy, former Special
Representative of the Secretary- General on Children and Armed Conflict
and former Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women. The study was
intended to review the progress made towards achieving the goals set out
in the WPS Resolutions and to outline a global policy agenda to inform
WPS efforts going forward (UN Women, 2014).The long view 49 Fifteen
years on from the adoption of UNSCR 1325, Spain sponsored the adoption
of a further resolution, UNSCR 2242[. This resolution is the most recent
in the WPS framework and the main focus is a call for WPS to be a
cross-cutting issue within the Countering Violence Extremism agenda.
This is a departure from the recommendations of the Global Study on
UNSCR 1325, which recommended that CVE be separated from women's rights,
noting that the instrumental use of women's rights can be harmful in
fragile situations]{.underline} (Wright, 2015). More positively, as
Wright (2015) notes, UNSCR 2242 does call for research into the impact
of CVE on women's rights. In addition to CVE, UNSCR 2242 makes a number
of other contributions to the WPS agenda. These include the creation of
an Informal Expert Group on WPS at the UN Security Council (a
recommendation of the Global Study) and a call for WPS to be
incorporated into all country-specific situations on the Security
Council's agenda. As Table 2.1 points out, the WPS Resolutions can be
broadly categorised into those addressing CRSGBV and those addressing
WP. The CRSGBV Resolutions have been critiqued for being reductive in
framing the rationale for women's participation as a means to address
CR-SGBV (Heathcote, 2018: 380). The paradigm also presents men from
conflict-affected states as the perpetrators of CRSGBV, deflecting from
the inadequacies within other 'peacetime' states' approach to the issue
(Heathcote, 2018: 380). [CRSGBV is understood as the archetypal
experience of women during conflict. As Heathcote (2018: 380) argues,
this could deflect 'attention from economic needs, Gender-based Violence
and the role of gendered power relations in producing the myriad of
gendered harms that communities experience'. As Meger (2016: 153)
contends, this has resulted from the 'securitization' of CRSGBV which
has entailed presenting the issue as a threat to the state with the
assumption that restoring state authority and bringing perpetrators to
justice will decrease CRSGBV. In separating CRSGBV from the broader
continuum of violence against women, evident through peacetime and in
conflict, women's insecurity is not adequately addressed.]{.underline}
UNSCR 1889 and UNSCR 2122 focus on substantive representation,
developing further the call for women's participation in UNSCR 1325. As
Heathcote (2018: 381) cautions, while this is a welcome development it
has also been accompanied by a shift to the use of indicators as a means
to 'measure' the success of WPS. [As she notes, indicators are never
neutral or objective tools and there is a risk that WPS will become a
means to count women, rather than to meaningfully address the 'the
substantive and structural disadvantages that hinder women's full
participation within any community']{.underline} (Heathcote, 2018: 381).
UNSCR 1889 also lacks nuance in considering just which women are
represented and assumes women are a homogenous group able to speak for
all. [Both Resolutions also fall back on emphasising the need to consult
women's civil society groups as a solution to WP, rather than
considering how to promote women as decision makers]{.underline}
(Heathcote, 2018: 380).

#### Attempting to achieve gender equality through policy initiatives reinforces protective masculinity and the subordination of the feminine within NATO

[As the above has demonstrated, gender work at NATO has largely been the
domain of women]{.underline}. This has provided an opportunity for women
to advance their own and other's interests, but also serves to further a
conflation of gender with women, or women's issues, that can have
restrictive effects on how the role and92 NATO women and gendermen place
of women -- and the utility of a gender perspective -- is understood
within NATO, as our analysis in Chapter 5 demonstrates. Drawing on the
work of Hurley (2018a), here we want to explore what happens when
military men start to engage in gender work within NATO. This is a
relatively recent occurrence, there are still relatively few men working
in senior positions to advance NATO's engagement with WPS or working as
gender advisors -- though this number is growing at a significant rate.
These developments are also complemented by an increased willingness by
high-profile and senior men within NATO, including the Secretary
General, to publicly advocate WPS and the work of the NCGP; for example
the 2018 annual meeting of the NCGP was opened by a keynote address from
Jens Stoltenberg. Though, as we have identified above, this is not the
first time a Secretary General has expressed support and provided
important influence in advancing NATO's gender agenda. [Here we conceive
of the men 'doing gender work' as 'gendermen'; and occupying a distinct
position within NATO]{.underline}. They are men, working in
predominantly female-occupied job roles in an organisation dominated by
men (Hurley, 2018a). [In many ways they challenge or transgress what are
deemed to be 'appropriate' or acceptable norms within NATO. Here we
explore how these perceived transgressions are policed and controlled by
those same institutional structures and norms and can reinforce a
masculinist protection logic (Young, 2003) that we argue in Chapter 1
underpins NATO's broader engagement with WPS]{.underline}. Yet, we also
argue that men engaging with gender work can offer opportunities for
positive, incremental changes in the ways in which militarised
masculinities are understood (Duncanson, 2013, 2015) and by extension an
opportunity to expose and push for broader changes within NATO's
institutional structures that continue to privilege men and masculinity
(Hurley, 2018a, 2018b). Men doing gender work at NATO identified some of
the key challenges that they faced in advancing that work. Some of these
challenges were informal, yet powerful ways of highlighting difference
and reinforcing what was perceived to be acceptable: other people are
not convinced, even my colleagues make a lot of jokes about me: 'You are
"genderman", have you shaved your legs?' These are jokes, but sometimes,
inside their brains, there is some kind of truth. They don't believe in
this. Now seeing a man \[doing this work\], I think they will open their
eyes a little bit more. Interview with NATO Official, 2012 in Hurley
(2018) Lazar (2005, 2007) suggests that these sorts of 'gender
crossings' -- the transgression of expected gender norms, in this case a
military man working on gender issues -- emphasise the underlying
dualism of the gender structure within any given organisation.
[Deviations from these gender-appropriate norms are often policed
through criticism and containment, in both formal and informal ways --
such as jokes and humour (Lazar, 2005: 8--9). Hearn has argued that
'trivialisation through humour' is one of myriad social and
psychological resources that military organisations provide for the
reproduction and changing of individual psychologies (in Higate, 2003:
xiii). And yet, it is a particular form of trivialisation; one that
seeks to feminise both the individual and the work that he is doing.
This joke serves to both feminise the individual man and, by extension,
identify his work as feminine and therefore unimportant within NATO as
an institution of international hegemonic masculinity]{.underline}. The
joke is used to link gender work at NATO with (a culturally specific)
feminine practice -- the shaving of legs -- reinforcing an implicit and
persistent conflation of gender with 'women's issues'. Women shave their
legs, men do not; therefore gender is a woman's concern, not a man's
(Hurley, 2018a). In this example, through working on gender issues, by
addressing and highlighting the merits of the Women, Peace and Security
agenda to other men within the organisation, the masculinity of the
gendermen is questioned. [As Duncanson (2015) notes, one of the ways in
which hegemonic masculinity achieves its hegemonic status is through the
feminisation of 'other' groups of men]{.underline} (in Hurley, 2018a:
13). And yet the response to this challenge is important too. The
distinct and highly visible position that gendermen have is understood
as an opportunity to change minds of other resistant men and, in doing
so, increase the importance of gender within NATO: Some of them just
don't see the practical use. They just can't get beyond the idea that
women, approaching them, understanding them and that addressing their
security needs matters at all ... I know some men here will tell me, and
they wouldn't tell her \[his female colleague\], that they don't quite
buy the concept. So, I can have conversations with them as far as that
goes and both they and I gain a better insight into the concept.
Interview with NATO Official, 2012 in Hurley (2018) So, gendermen can
use their distinct positions, and (re)negotiate their identities in the
context within which they find themselves and in response to challenges,
to change the minds and perspectives of these resistant colleagues. [Yet
what is highlighted here is the importance of men speaking to, listening
to and being influenced by other men (rather than their women
colleagues). This reinforces an understanding of whose voices -- and
what messages -- are afforded respect and credibility within NATO, a
point we develop further in Chapter 5. In addition to the risk of
feminisation, a common concern of men involved or interested in
gender-equality initiatives across a broad range of institutions was a
perceived challenge to or misunderstanding of their
heterosexuality.]{.underline} In their study of gender mainstreaming
within EU member states, Ruxton and Van der Gaag (2013: 169) identify
that there was 'absolute terror in individual men \[of\] coming across
as gay, as female and so on'. This conflation of gender and sexuality
was also evident at NATO: I speak with my friends, and I say I work in
gender and they start shouting about the gays and the lesbians and you
have to say: 'I don't have anything to do with gays and lesbians, it is
gender'. The thing is, what I do mainly is work to protect men and
women, boys and girls who suffer the effects of operations, missions and
worse; and in that moment people change their perspective and say: 'oh
my God'; and I say: 'you can literally help them'. [Here, then, there is
a fear of feminisation and subordination through a perceived association
of working on WPS at NATO with homosexuality (Hurley, 2018a).
Interestingly all of the men we spoke to made explicit reference to
their wives, girlfriends or children, often at the beginning of
conversations, something that the women we spoke to very rarely did.
Others made clear references to being 'OK with gay men' -- even when the
focus of the discussion was on a seemingly unrelated topic -- with some
even suggesting that a focus on LGBT rights should become part of NATO's
broader WPS engagement]{.underline}. Hurley (2018a; in Holmes et al.,
2019: 25) has speculated that this might be one mechanism gendermen use
to affirm their heterosexuality and to dispel any misperceptions or
ambiguity regarding their sexuality, and/or be used as a bonding ploy
when in conversation with other men (Conway, 2008; Schwalbe and
Wolkomir, 2001). [There was also a common articulation that engaging in
gender work and promoting the WPS agenda at NATO was a way to protect
the vulnerable, most commonly, though not exclusively, women and
children. Chapter 1 has shown how masculine norms at NATO reinforce a
particular hegemonic regime that becomes built into the structures of
the alliance and are transmitted to member and partner states through
NATO's role as a 'teaching machine'. Informing these norms is a logic of
masculinist protection]{.underline}. There is broader evidence of this
logic in the way that NATO framed its engagement with WPS under the
banner of Protection, Participation and Prevention, as we have explored
in Chapter 2 and go onto discuss further in Chapter 5. What the quotes
above, and the accounts of the gendermen, highlight is an
individualisation of this broader masculinist protectionist narrative: I
tend to think that we work for men and women, boys and girls. You focus
on the weakest part, the people that are suffering the most. So maybe
men don't suffer, but then I think that is happening more and more. In
that way our objective is much more interesting and your work is much
more rewarding, let's say. Interview with NATO Official, 2012 in Hurley
(2018) [Here, then, gender work is framed as work that helps and is
informed by a desire to protect]{.underline}. In similar ways to Young's
(2003) conceptualisation, this account of masculinist protection is
expressed in benign terms yet a hierarchy between vulnerable,
predominantly non-Western civilians, and a powerful Western military
organisation acting a protector is established nonetheless: 'the role of
the masculine protector puts those protected, paradigmatically women and
children, in a subordinate position of dependence' (Young, 2003: 2).
[The masculinist protection narratives as a response challenges these
individual gendermen face draws upon and reinforces broader
constructions of hegemonic masculinity at NATO writ large. They provide
a further mechanism through which the disruption of their
'transgression' can be normalised.]{.underline}

#### The perm is worse than the alt alone---NATO's history of co-optation allows it to defang feminist demands and insulate itself from criticism

[Feminist goals are always inherently vulnerable to co-option. This
occurs when institutions use feminist rhetoric selectively 'to promote
their own agenda irrespective of the consequences for women's
lives']{.underline} (D'Costa and Lee-Koo, 2013: 2). Co-option as a
practice 'absorbs the meanings of the original concepts to fit into the
prevailing political priorities' (von der Lippe, 2012: 19[). On one
level co-option occurs when these original feminist concepts interact
with hegemonic strategic policy priorities and objectives, neutralising
their transformative praxis]{.underline} (von der Lippe, 2012: 20). Our
discussion in Chapter 5 on the meaning of a 'gender perspective' draws
attention to this. [However, the implications of cooption are arguably
far more severe for feminist praxis when they are used as an alibi for
neutralising positive action or opposition. This sees institutions
'appropriate the language of advocacy in order to co-opt social movement
resistance']{.underline} (True, 2003: 379). [A public commitment to
feminist goals can therefore become resistance to feminism.]{.underline}
For example, at the national level, large corporations which adopt
legislative recommendations before they are binding are likely to do so
because they are vulnerable to criticism if they are not seen to be
proactively engaged (Martin, 2000: 213). The public commitment may
indeed loosely correlate to certain specific actions taken by the
institution. However, ultimately it allows the institution to co-opt the
issue and use it to support an alternate message (Martin, 2000: 213).
[Initiatives which on the surface appear progressive then come to sit
against both sexist and racist institutional structures which are left
unchallenged]{.underline}. For example, research on UK universities'
implementation of the 2010 Race Relations Act finds a disjuncture
between the image of the university presented in an implementation
policy and the reality (Ahmed, 2007: 594). Ahmed's concept of 'documents
as performance' is helpful here (2007: 594). Ahmed asks us to consider
how documents become 'forms of institutional performance in two senses.
Both the ways in which institutions perform an image of themselves
through the document and how institutions perform presenting an image of
"doing well"' (Ahmed, 2007: 594). [International Women's Day provides
another example of an event with radical and transformative foundations
which is now being marked by global108 Gendering NATO's core tasks
corporations, the UN and other international actors, including NATO. The
first International Women's Day was organised by internationalist
socialist women in the USA in 1907 with the aim of bringing attention to
their fight for equality in every aspect of life (Kaplan, 1985: 166). In
Europe, the inaugural event was held in 1911 to draw attention to the
cause of women's suffrage]{.underline} (Kaplan, 1985: 166). It was the
celebration of International Women's Day in Russia in 1917, where women
were joined by men from the metal works in protests on the breadline and
in factories,2 which really served to root the day in its transformative
socialist origins (Kaplan, 1985: 166). The protests and the response of
the Czar (who ordered his generals to shoot if necessary) precipitated
the February revolution (Kaplan, 1985: 166). [Despite these origins, the
increasing neo-liberalisation of International Women's Day is evident
through its adoption by global corporations. This has been accompanied
by a shift to understand the day as about women's empowerment, rather
than women's rights]{.underline} (Grosser and McCarthy, 2018).
Ultimately, this has led to its distancing from the transnational
feminist activism which is at its core (Grosser and McCarthy, 2018). [To
mark International Women's Day 2018, NATO launched a Facebook and
Instagram campaign posing the question: 'Did you know that NATO has more
women in leadership positions than ever before? Together -- men and
women -- we are stronger! #IWD2018'. While this may be true, as we
discuss in Chapter 1, this belies the reality of the continued and
significant marginalisation of women from decision-making roles within
NATO]{.underline}. There has been progress, but it has been slow. [This
presents the possibility that International Women's Day has been
co-opted as a public diplomacy tool to promote a linear picture of
progress of women's empowerment, one removed from the reality of women's
positions within these institutional structures, whether global
corporations or NATO.]{.underline} Rather than reflect on existing
institutional challenges to gender equality, again as we outline in
Chapter 1, NATO has marked the day by presenting a positive picture of a
gender-sensitive employer. This supports the argument that one outcome
of the commodification and co-option of feminist agendas (e.g. gender
equality and women's rights) can be that they lose their transformative
potential (Acker, 2006: 460). [At the international level, the
implications of co-option are epitomised in the relationship of
feminists to the World Bank]{.underline}. Following the 1995 Beijing
Fourth World Conference on Women, a 'Women's Eyes on the Bank'
initiative was established to monitor and attempt to transform the World
Bank (True, 2003: 379). [The women's movement shifted from challenging
the World Bank to viewing it 'as a potential ally in dialogues between
women's groups and their own governments' (O'Brien et al., 2000). This
resulted in women's needs and goals being framed as compatible with the
neoliberal logics underpinning World Bank programmes]{.underline}
(Bergeron, 2001: 1002). The relationship between local women's movements
and the World Bank has therefore facilitated the appropriation of the
'language of advocacy' by the institution (True, 2003: 379). [The very
real danger of the co-option of feminist agendas by international
institutions necessitates critical feminist knowledge of how such
institutions operate.]{.underline} Gender mainstreaming is one policy
initiative which states and international institutions have engaged
with, which has transformative potential. Gender mainstreaming refers to
'efforts to scrutinize and reinvent processes of policy formulation and
implementation across all issue areas to address and rectify persistent
and emerging disparities between men and women' (True and Mintrom, 2001:
28). It has its origins in the UN conferences on women (True and
Mintrom, 2001: 28), and is also called for in UNSCR 1325 (United
Nations, 2000). It is a core part of NATO's implementation of WPS. For
example, the 2018 NATO/EAPC Women, Peace and Security Policy and Action
Plan 2018 brochure states that 'gender equality is considered as an
integral part of NATO policies, programmes and projects guided by
effective gender mainstreaming practices' (NATO/EAPC, 2018). Gender
mainstreaming initiatives are retroactive in the sense that the
organisational structure as well as the practices, norms and behaviours
of individuals within that structure predate gender mainstreaming as a
policy initiative (Benschop and Verloo, 2006: 20). They can therefore be
characterised as 'disruptive' because of an inherent tension and
competition between a 'new' focus on 'gender' and the institutional
'mainstream' (Benschop and Verloo 2006: 20). If implemented correctly,
such initiatives should seek to address the persistence of gender
inequality within organisations and through doing so asks 'new' things
of the institution. They therefore have the potential to address 'the
genderedness of organisations: the material and discursive constructions
of masculinity and femininity that shape and are shaped by
organisations' (Benschop and Verloo, 2006: 19). [As Walby (2005: 322)
argues, pre-existing institutional priorities (in the case of NATO, the
'core tasks' outlined in the NATO Strategic Concept) 'compete with goals
of gender equality for prioritisation, which makes gender mainstreaming
an inherently contested process that is never simply about adopting new
policy'.]{.underline} Instead, the process involves a 'negotiation'
between the 'dual agenda' of the established institutional practices and
gender equality (Walby, 2005: 322). Here it is 'new' policy that is
struggling with the existing organisational norms; disrupting them and
rendering them visible. [Analysing the effects of particular
'disruptive' policy initiatives within NATO provides insight into the
pervasiveness of gender norms and hierarchies. However, contextualising
NATO's concern with gender issues against its core tasks, collective
defence, crisis management and cooperative security, brings into
question whether they were ever 'disruptive' or can bring the change
expected of them in terms of transforming NATO's role as an institution
of international hegemonic masculinity]{.underline}.

[The Global Study rightly notes that women peace activists who lobbied
for 1325 "were seeking a fundamental shift" in how international
security is pursued; a "rollback of the escalating levels of
militarization making homes, communities and nations less rather than
more secure". Yet since the passage of 1325, many Member States, UN
agencies and civil society actors have tended to prioritise adding women
and their concerns into existing militarised systems for maintaining
peace and security, whilst deprioritising efforts to challenge the very
nature of those systems]{.underline}. This is evident in the fact that
many of the states championing women, peace and security on the global
stage also continue to pursue militarised foreign policies. The UK, for
example, has recently been working hard to push for faster
implementation of 1325 internationally, whilst providing political and
military support for the Saudi-led coalition's bombing of Yemen,
fuelling a rapidly growing humanitarian crisis in that country. [In
preparation for the Global Study, Saferworld and others highlighted this
trend and called for the agenda to prioritise preventing violent
conflict by address its underlying structural causes.]{.underline} The
Global Study -- authored independently by Radhika Coomaraswamy, in
consultation with UN agencies, Member States and civil society -- makes
a call for greater use of non-violent approaches to conflict prevention
as its very first recommendation, and states that "a militarized view of
conflict prevention sells resolution 1325 short of its transformative
vision". [Yet, perhaps unsurprisingly, UNSCR 2242 does not reflect this
bold message, making only passing reference to the need to "invest more
in conflict prevention".]{.underline} The provisions of the resolution
-- which include, among other things, higher targets for numbers of
female peacekeepers, better inclusion of gender-based violence in
sanctions regimes, and more gender advisers within the UN system -- may
well bring some positive outcomes for women and girls living with
conflict and violence. [But they present technical fixes, filling gaps
in the previous resolutions, rather than an attempt to rethink how we
approach international security and turn back the tide of
militarisation]{.underline}. The Global Study also notes that,
"Militarism and cultures of militarized masculinities create and sustain
political decision-making where resorting to the use of force becomes a
normalized mode for dispute resolution". [Questions around men and
masculinities have often been neglected in policy and practice around
1325: activists have competing perspectives on the the politics of
focusing attention and resources on men and boys as part of an agenda
that seeks to put an end to male dominance in the field of peace and
security]{.underline}. Saferworld advocates for the transformation of
militarised masculinities as part of efforts to prevent conflict, and
strongly welcomes the Global Study's recommendation to support the
training of men, women, girls and boys which "reinforces and supports
non-violent, non-militarized expressions of masculinity[". As with the
other recommendations on conflict prevention and demilitarisation,
however, recommendations on masculinities were not reflected in 2242
beyond a brief mention of "engagement by men and boys as partners" - a
much weaker message. Perhaps the issue where the fault lines have
appeared most strikingly in recent months has been the role of women in
countering violent extremism, which features prominently in UNSCR 2242.
The Global Study calls for the promotion of women's rights to be
detached from counter-terrorism and military planning processes, noting
that counter-terror strategies, and their instrumentalisation of the
women's rights agenda, can be directly harmful to women and girls in
fragile contexts]{.underline}. For example, restrictions on financial
transfers to areas subject to counter-terror measures prevent women's
organisations from receiving funding, while attempts to justify military
interventions based on concerns about women's rights risk provoking a
violent backlash against women's rights activists. [Saferworld's
research underlines that counter-terror strategies also frequently serve
to deepen conflicts and undermine efforts to build peace. While women
can and do play important roles in preventing radicalisation in their
communities, simplistic notions that empowering women is the key to
ending violent extremism risk placing a huge burden of responsibility on
individual women without addressing the many other injustices and
failures of governance which so often drive conflict and radicalisation.
Despite the Global Study's words of warning, UNSCR 2242 calls for
greater integration of the women, peace and security and counter-terror
agendas]{.underline}. The broad language of the resolution is, like most
such documents, open to varying interpretations. More positively, it
does call for research on "the impacts of counter-terrorism strategies
on women's human rights and women's organizations". The news that
counter-terrorism is officially on the women, peace and security agenda
(and vice versa) will be welcomed by some women peace activists as
evidence that women's roles are being taken seriously, but will no doubt
garner concerned reactions from others, including many in countries that
are the focus of counter-terror efforts.

### Hegemonic Masculinity

#### The aff's lack of gendered analysis about NATO specifically reproduces hegemonic masculinity, creating violent hierarchies

masculinity." NATO, Gender, and the Military: Women Organising from
Within. Routledge Studies in Gender and Security. 2019. Pg 17-21. LJS

[The concept of hegemonic masculinity was brought to prominence by
Connell (1995) and refers to the particular set of masculine norms and
practices that come to subordinate other masculinities, enabling the
continued dominance of men over women. Hegemonic masculinity is never
explicit and has primarily been built upon cultural norms (Connell and
Messerschmidt, 2005: 832) and supported by institutional power
(Kronsell, 2012: 45). The military occupies the most important position
for the definition of hegemonic masculinity (Connell, 1995: 213). As a
military alliance NATO is also a source of 'normative conception of
gender', amplifying already dominant cultural norms but also actively
participating in their construction (Carreiras, 2006: 40).]{.underline}
This makes NATO, as a trans-Atlantic military alliance, a key site for
the transfer of gendered values. The concept of hegemonic masculinity
refers to a configuration or pattern of 'idealised' masculine
characteristics that occupy a position of power and privilege within
particular a social, cultural and temporal context (Connell, 2005: 78).
Central to this formulation is the notion differentiation within
masculinities, bound up with varying levels of power and privilege.
Connell defines these as 'hegemonic', 'subordinate', 'complicit' and
'marginalised' masculinities (Connell, 2005: 79). Subordinate
masculinities therefore are those which do not conform (or are not seen
to conform) to hegemonic ideals. For Connell, (assumed) characteristics
and practices of subordinated masculinities are often 'blurred' with
femininity (Connell, 2005: 79) -- 'effeminate', homosexual men for
example -- thereby allowing for them to be 'symbolically expelled' from
the hegemonic representation of 'masculinity'. Complicit masculinity
encompasses Connell's notion of the 'patriarchal dividend'. [In short,
Connell (2005: 79)18 NATO as an institution asserts that whilst not all
men represent the hegemonic ideal, the majority of men gain advantage
from the overall subordination of women-- that there is an inherent
dividend attached to simply being born a man, into the one half of a
socially constructed binary that is culturally more valued.]{.underline}
As Via (2010: 43) argues: [A man's (or anyone's) claim to masculinity
... is a positional claim in opposition to a feminine other that society
has constructed to be the lesser of the two binaries. Without the
existence of an individual or group that can be labelled as the weaker
party, masculine social norms would be without content. In addition to
gender, ethnicity, class and other marginalised characteristics also
have a part to play in how hegemonic masculinity is
constructed]{.underline}. Here, it is necessary to consider 'relations
between the masculinities in dominant and subordinated classes or ethnic
groups' (Connell, 2005: 80[). This is a linear relationship between the
'authorisation' of the hegemonic masculinity of the dominant group and
the marginalised. So, while it is possible for some within marginalised
communities to embody hegemonic masculinity, this does not necessarily
correlate with an increase in social authority to the wider
group]{.underline}. Indicative of this is the example of black men
athletes in the United States who are seen to embody hegemonic
masculinity, but this is not something extended beyond their elite
grouping (Connell, 2005: 81). Hegemonic masculinity is plural and
variable. It is therefore necessary to centralise the 'relationality' of
gender relations. This means considering the relationship both within
and between masculinities and femininities. No masculinity (or
femininity) arises except in a complex system of gender relations that
are fluid and contextually specific (Connell, 2005: 73). Therefore
'masculinity, like femininity, is always liable to internal
contradiction and historical disruption' (Connell, 2005: 73). To state
that particular manifestations of masculinity are hegemonic is not to
suggest that all, or even most, men enact or embody hegemonic
masculinity; indeed, it can be argued that most men do not (see
Demetriou, 2001: 342[). Hegemonic masculinity can therefore be seen to
represent normative ideals about the conduct, embodiment and enactment
of masculinity in any culturally specific context.]{.underline} However,
Connell posits the question: 'What is "normative" about a norm hardly
anyone meets'? (Connell, 2005a: 70). It is normative then, not in the
numerical sense, but in that it culturally accepted and legitimised via
particular cultural practices and through institutions. [Hegemonic
ideals are therefore conditional and intrinsically linked to
institutional power; they are constructed via process rather than
existing as a fixed or static 'type' and intimately linked to
context:]{.underline} Hegemony is likely to be established only if there
is some correspondence between cultural ideal and institutional power,
collective if not individual. So the top levels of business, the
military and government provide a fairly convincing corporate display of
masculinity, still very little shaken by feminist women or dissenting
men. [It is the successful claim to authority, more than direct violence
that is the mark of hegemony (though violence often underpins or
supports authority).]{.underline} (Connell, 2005a: 77) In this
conceptualisation, hegemonic masculinity is bound up with the
legitimation of authority and claims to power and privilege in a
particular gender order or gender regime. [This legitimation and claims
to authority within institutions and cultural practices produce a façade
of unitary masculinity which determine the standards against which other
masculinities (and femininities) are then defined]{.underline} (Cornwall
and Lindisfarne, 1994: 20). In the example of the military,
constructions of hegemonic masculinity are drawn upon to construct
uniformity within the soldiers and conformity to particular
organisational priorities. That the unitary nature of hegemonic
masculinity may be 'illusionary' does not negate the powerful, dominant
effects it has upon 'other' masculinities and femininity, more broadly
defined. As Sandra Via (2010: 43) notes: The dominance of hegemonic
masculinity relies on its opposition to and competition with
subordinated masculinities and femininities. [Hegemonic masculinities at
once promote a particular organisation of the political order and
reinforces unequal relationships between men and women in order to
promote the legitimation of masculine authority.]{.underline} Hegemonic
masculinity therefore has powerful 'organisational' effects (and indeed,
can be drawn upon as a particular organisational resource) through which
unequal patterns of gender relations can be ordered and maintained. One
of the main critiques of the concept of hegemonic masculinity -- indeed
of a hierarchical gender order, more generally -- is that it can imply a
rigidity or a static representation, a 'type' or 'essence' of
masculinity; further, that this was a negative type or a toxic
assemblage of traits (Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005: 840). Ultimately,
that there was an inherent 'descriptive tendency' within the concept of
hegemonic masculinity that resulted in essentialised characteristics
being applied to particular groups of men. [Connell and Messerschmidt
rejected this critique and re-emphasised the importance placed on social
context (2005: 832--3), asserting that just as masculinity and
femininity is not a fixed entity in the body or personality traits of
individuals -- masculinities are configurations of practice that are
accomplished in social action and therefore can differ according to the
gender relations in a particular social setting.]{.underline} (Connell
and Messerschmidt, 2005: 836) Indeed, it can be argued that the various
usages and application of the term across a wide variety of empirical
and theoretical research (including Feminist International Relations --
see Kronsell, 2005 below) necessitate periodic critical evaluation as
the concept 'must mutate' as it 'finds applications in other settings
and by other hands' (Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005: 854; Tickner and
Sjoberg, 2011: 227--9; Messerschmidt, 2012). [A level of appropriation
or co-option, of elements from subordinate or marginalised masculinities
and indeed of femininities, is necessary for hegemonic masculinities to
remain hegemonic in changing social or cultural settings]{.underline}
(Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005: 848). Hegemony can be accomplished
through 'the incorporation of such masculinities into a functioning
gender order rather than by active oppression in the form of discredit
or violence' (Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005: 848). Both co-option and
oppression can, and often do, occur together (Connell and Messerschmidt,
2005: 848). They are 'to a significant degree constituted in men's
interaction with women; therefore the commonalities in women's gender
practices also produce convergence' (Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005:
848). [This notion of 'hybridisation', through appropriation, rather
than overt violence, is a key theme in critical masculinities studies
that sought to theorise the contested, contradictory, yet ultimately
variable relationships between the masculinities of Connell's gender
order]{.underline} (for example: Messner, 1992, 1993, 2007; Anderson,
1993; Demetriou, 2001; Bridges, 2014). Messner (2007) puts forward a
notion of a culturally ascendant hybrid masculinity that combines
toughness and tenderness, but in specific ways which obscure (and
perpetuate) power and inequality (Bridges, 2014: 61). Anderson (2010)
has formulated a theory of 'Inclusive Masculinity' to explain what he
sees as a (Western) cultural shift in declining homophobia and greater
sexual and gender equality -- though the extent of Anderson's
'inclusivity' within contemporary Western masculinity in regard to
homosexuality is contested (O'Neill, 2015). Demetriou (2001: 345)
critiques an inherent elitism within Connell's conceptualisation of
hegemonic masculinity, in that it downplays -- or neglects entirely --
the agency of individuals within subordinated masculinities and women
generally, something Connell and Messerschmidt acknowledge (2005: 847).
Demetriou's work focuses on the appropriation of elements of gay culture
into a 'contemporary hegemonic bloc' that reproduces rather than
challenges patriarchy. What these studies (Anderson's excluded) note is
that the malleability of hegemonic forms or manifestations of
masculinity does not suggest that patriarchal power is undermined.
[Indeed, it is suggested that transformation, appropriation and
hybridisation of particular hegemonic forms of masculinity are essential
for them to remain hegemonic and therefore do nothing to advance gender
equality.]{.underline} As this discussion highlights, hegemonic
masculinity is the norm and is normative, but it is never explicit and
although this hegemony could be supported by force, it has primarily
been built upon cultural norms (Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005: 832)
and supported by institutional power (Kronsell, 2012: 45). [For example,
Connell (1995: 213) argues that the military (in Europe and the US)
occupies the most important position for the definition of hegemonic
masculinity. As a military alliance, NATO is also a source of 'normative
conception of gender', amplifying already dominant cultural norms but
also actively participating in their construction (Carreiras, 2006: 40).
This makes NATO, as a trans-Atlantic political and military alliance, a
key site for the transfer of gendered values and a valuable space for
the study of military masculinities.]{.underline}

### War

#### Patriarchy is the root cause of violence---masculine norms require violent actions for membership into privileged groups

the Women\'s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF).
"'Terminally Unserious': Ideologies and Oppressions of Nuclear Weapons."
Banning the Bomb, Smashing the Patriarchy. 2021. Pg 26-30 LJS

Based on what I have seen over the past fifteen years working around the
United Nations and even longer as an antinuclear activist, I
believe---as several feminists have argued previously---that a
significant part of why this knot is so hard to untie is patriarchy[. In
fact, as a feminist disarmament activist, I have come to believe that
more than anything else, the association of weapons with power is one of
the foremost obstacles to disarmament. And, as feminist scholars have
articulated time and again, that this association is
gendered.]{.underline} Patriarchy is a system of power. It is, in the
barest sense, a hierarchical social order in which women are subordinate
to men. But it is more than that. It is an order that shapes and
entrenches gender as a cultural construction and system that endows the
hegemonic conception of what is a "man" with the "right" to dominate and
rule over others. Understanding how patriarchy works requires us to
understand how gender works. Gender refers to the socially constructed
expectations and norms about how we are supposed to perform as women,
men, and others, or in relation to sexual orientations; that is,
concepts of masculine and feminine and the normative demands of how to
behave in order to "properly" represent the bodies we inhabit or are
perceived to inhabit. [It comes from a particular---and unfortunately,
very dominant---understanding of masculinity. This is a masculinity in
which ideas such as strength, courage, and protection are equated with
violence. It is a masculinity in which the capacity and willingness to
use weapons, engage in combat, and kill other human beings is seen as
essential to being "a real man."77 Feminists have long explored the ways
in which gender norms, particularly militarized masculinities, drive
conflict and violence and the acquisition and proliferation of weapons.
These scholars and activists argue that the association of power and
strength, coded as masculine traits, with the accumulation and use of
weapons, has a negative impact on disarmament and peace.78]{.underline}
Militarized masculinity harms everyone. It harms those who do not comply
with mainstream gender norms--- queer-identified people, nonnormative
men---and it harms women. [It requires oppression of those deemed
"weaker" on the basis of gender norms. It also assumes men to be
inherently violent and inclined to participate in violent acts---and
thus also more expendable.7]{.underline}9 And it makes disarmament seem
weak. It makes peace seem utopian. It makes protection without weapons
seem absurd. When it comes to nuclear weapons, several dimensions to the
connection between patriarchal power and militarist masculinities
contribute to the difficulty in advocating for nuclear disarmament. We
can start with the "ubiquitous weight of gender" throughout the entire
nuclear weapon discourse and the association of nuclear weapons with
masculinity that Carol Cohn described in her groundbreaking work in the
1980s mentioned earlier. Her analysis of the gendered symbolism of
nuclear weapons developed through a discourse of "defense intellectuals"
provided the foundations for a feminist analysis of nuclear war, nuclear
strategy, and nuclear weapons. She described the "sanitized abstraction
and sexual imagery," including metaphors that equate military and
political power with sexual potency and masculinity---such as "vertical
erector launchers, thrust-to-weight ratios, soft lay downs, deep
penetration, the comparative advantages of protracted versus spasm
attacks," and discussions about how "the Russians are a little harder
than we are."80 [She and Sara Ruddick suggested that this type of highly
sexualized language serves to "mobilize gendered associations and
symbols in creating assent, excitement, support for, and identification
with weapons."81 It is also "a way of minimizing the seriousness of
militarist endeavors, of denying their deadly
consequences."82]{.underline} In later years Cohn, along with Ruddick
and Felicity Ruby, expanded the inquiry into the sense of masculine
strength afforded by nuclear weapons, tying this into some of the
broader feminist analysis about violent and militarized masculinities
discussed above. [They listened to a nationalist leader after India's
1998 nuclear weapon tests explain, "We had to prove that we are not
eunuchs."]{.underline} They argue that this statement is meant to
"elicit admiration for the wrathful manliness of the speaker" and to
imply that being willing to employ nuclear weapons is to "have the
balls" or to be "man enough" to "defend" your country.83 [This link
between masculinity and the power of force persists today. Think of
Trump "becoming presidential" by launching missiles at Syria84 or of Kim
Jong-un and his massive parades of missile hardware in a literal
showcase of "mine is bigger than yours."85 Think of Theresa May giving a
resolute yes to the question of whether she would be willing to
"personally authorize a nuclear strike that could kill 100,000 innocent
men, women and children."86 It is, after all, women leaders as well as
men who are conditioned to prove their capacity to lead by a "manly"
show of force.]{.underline} Simply adding women to the situation is not
sufficient to achieve nuclear disarmament. And "men" as a category are
not specifically or exclusively the problem. [Gendered norms, in
particular violent or militarized masculinities, are the main problem.
The structural imbalance of power among gender identities is also the
problem. A recent study published by New America paints a portrait of
the nuclear policy field in the United States, dominated as it is by
cisgender heterosexual white men who compose a self-described "nuclear
priesthood" that espouse normative masculinized perspectives on security
and weapons.]{.underline} Seeking a place at the table within this
space, women (mostly white, cisgender women) tend to be inclined to try
to gain favor with and impress the priesthood, seeing it as an important
challenge to fit in and prove that women are "not afraid of nuclear
weapons."87 As a case in point, the U.S. nuclear weapon team under the
Obama administration included women in the roles of secretary of state
(Hillary Clinton), undersecretary of state for arms control and
international security affairs (Ellen Tauscher), assistant secretary of
state for verification, compliance, and implementation (Rose
Gottemoeller), special representative of the president for nuclear
proliferation (Susan Burk), permanent representative to the United
Nations (Susan Rice), and permanent representative to the Conference on
Disarmament (Laura Kennedy). Yet the Obama administration pursued the
biggest nuclear arms buildup since Reagan and vociferously opposed
negotiations of a nuclear weapon ban treaty. Similarly, as of the
beginning of 2019, the CEOs of four of the five biggest weapon producers
in the United States---Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, General
Dynamics, and the military wing"Terminally Unserious" 29 of Boeing---are
now women.88 [These women are not challenging the patriarchal structures
and systems that have created the militarized world order; they are
actively maintaining it and profiting from it.]{.underline} The solution
to the dominance of toxic masculinity in disarmament discourse or
capitalism in the nuclear-industrial complex is not simply to include
women. [Liberal feminism is "dedicated to enabling a privileged few to
climb the corporate ladder or the ranks of the military," through which
it "subscribes to a market-centred view of equality that dovetails with
corporate enthusiasm for 'diversity,'"]{.underline} Nancy Fraser, Tithi
Bhattacharya, and Cinzia Arruzza have written for a new feminist
manifesto. Rather than abolish social hierarchy, liberal feminism "aims
to feminize it, ensuring women at the top can attain parity with the men
of their own class."89 As Cynthia Enloe says, "You can militarize
anything, including equality."90 To actually challenge policies and
practices of the elite decisionmaking class, it is imperative to create
space---inside but also outside of existing institutions---where women
and others of diverse gender identities, races and ethnicities,
backgrounds and experiences---who are willing and able to approach the
issue from different perspectives, including feminist and human security
perspectives---can be fully engaged. [A lesson from feminist, queer, and
Indigenous struggles, among others, is that appealing to the
establishment for rights or equality or a seat at the table is at best
insufficient to achieve change, and at worst serves to reinforce
existing injustices by just making problematic institutions or processes
appear more palatable or equitable without actually changing anything
those institutions do. In order for true alternative perspectives to be
treated as relevant, credible, and expert---to the same extent as the
dominant, toxic, militarized masculinity perspectives---we don't just
need diverse participation in mainstream institutions. We must consider
and create alternative spaces and relationships in order to engage in
meaningful processes.]{.underline} Just as Indigenous struggles refuse
to center or appeal to whiteness, and queer struggles refuse to center
or appeal to the cisgendered or straight community, we need to work with
others whose beliefs are outside the dominant, mainstream narrative of
nuclear weapons to generate a new sense of what is normative and
credible.91 This is important for the story of the nuclear ban and for
nuclear abolition more broadly, because changing what people view as
credible and normative about nuclear weapons is vital to achieving
change in nuclear weapon policy. [We need to not center the dominant
frameworks of thought on nuclear weapons---which were created
predominantly by white, cisgender, heteronormative men---but to bring a
robust critical approach to these frameworks by centering the
perspectives, ideas, and frameworks of thought developed by others who
have traditionally been excluded from this area.]{.underline}

### Feminist Foreign Policy

#### Vote negative to act from a feminist foreign policy -- this stance takes principles of care, responsibility, and empathy seriously as a normative framework for how states should act. Abandoning the self-fulfilling prophecies of realism is a pre-requisite to creating a lasting peace between nations.

**[Embedded in feminist]{.underline}** notions of **[foreign and
security policy is an ethical commitment to the care and nurturing of
distant others]{.underline}**, who reside beyond the confines of one's
own political community. As noted above, [scholarship on ethical foreign
policy is surprisingly void of gender analysis and feminist ethical
engagement despite]{.underline} the fact that [it is situated within the
subfield of normative IR]{.underline} that engages widely with issues
related to global justice and equality. We therefore propose that **[the
ethics of care provides]{.underline}** fertile **[ground for thinking
through]{.underline}** the analysis of **[feminist-inspired foreign and
security policy]{.underline}** discourse and practice as well as
identifying the limits to such engagement. [Ethics of care scholarship
has been inspired by social psychology.]{.underline}51 Carol Gilligan
argues that **[care is a form of moral development distinct from the
justice-oriented moral dimension stemming from Enlightenment
thinking.]{.underline}** [In the first generation]{.underline} of
studies on ethics of care, [there was an explicit association with
female experiences as an alternative to maleled justice
reasoning.]{.underline} A key contention here is that [the mother's
distinct relationship with her child gives her a set of caring and
nurturing skills]{.underline} that are [transferrable beyond the
immediate family and nation.]{.underline} Sara Ruddick, among others,
suggests that **[maternal and caring relations can bring about
peace.]{.underline}**52 Still, [while maternal care is strongly
associated with women's bodies,]{.underline} Ruddick insists that
**[mothering is not a practice confined to women alone.]{.underline}**53
Yet, in realpolitik, **[women, and mothers in particular, are frequently
depicted as innately peaceful, which is an assumption]{.underline}**
that has been **[contested and rejected in feminist IR
scholarship.]{.underline}**54 Instead, [feminist ethical theory has been
attentive not to essentialise all women as peaceful, but]{.underline}
instead [to fully recognise the differences that exist between
women.]{.underline} [The second generation of care ethics scholars
understand care in broader terms.]{.underline} For example, Joan
**[Tronto defines care as 'everything we do to maintain, continue and
repair our world so]{.underline}** that **[we can live in it as well as
possible'.]{.underline}**55 [We find]{.underline} the broad range of
[scholarly efforts to globalise ethics of care]{.underline}56 [useful to
theorise feminist foreign policy]{.underline} because it can shed light
on how **[care principles may be used in foreign policy]{.underline}**
in an effort **[to address global gender inequalities, violence and
protection across borders.]{.underline}** **[This necessitates taking
issue with the assumption that]{.underline}** ethics of **[care is
inapplicable to the study of global gender politics]{.underline}**
because of its essentialisation of women's experiences and universal
lack of agency. Fiona Robinson rightly notes, **[concerns over the
essentialism of care ethics must be taken seriously]{.underline}**, I
would argue that it is only a narrow, orthodox, ethics of care **[-- the
view of care as essentially a morality for women, belonging in the
private sphere]{.underline}** and valorising 'dependence' over
'independence' -- to which these criticisms actually apply ... clearly,
**[the importance of an ethics of care, and its transformatory
potential, does not, and indeed must not, rest on its association with
women.]{.underline}** While [it is crucial to avoid undermining its
feminist origins ... the ethics of care is significant because it
represents an alternative view of ethics]{.underline} which is relevant
beyond the role of women within the family ... **['it' extends beyond
the personal to the political and, ultimately, to the global context of
social life.]{.underline}**57 In line with Robinson's argument, **[we
challenge orthodox conceptions of care ethics as a 'morality for
women']{.underline}** only, **[while maintaining]{.underline}** that
**[its emphasis on dialogue and care]{.underline}** is a useful approach
[to critically unpack the moral ambitions of a feminist and gender-based
foreign policy-making.]{.underline} Moreover, we argue that **[the
ethical foundations of feminist foreign policy]{.underline}**, by and
large, **[are consistent with the normative imperative of a globalised
ethics of care]{.underline}**, which contends that **['those who are
powerful have a responsibility to approach moral problems by looking
carefully at where, why and how]{.underline}** the **[structures of
existing social and personal relations have led to exclusion and
marginalization'.]{.underline}**58 In contrast, **[orthodox notions of
foreign policy do not consider the situatedness of the state within
distinct cultural, political and ethical settings]{.underline}** nor the
intersectional subjectivities and moral preferences of the citizens
inhabiting that sphere. However, **[an ethics of care approach to the
study of foreign policy is sensitive to such variation because it is
based on a relational ontology]{.underline}**, which addresses the moral
relations between human beings. Hence, **[an ethics of care approach to
the study of feminist foreign policy takes into account the situated
moral stories and experiences of individuals]{.underline}** and **[in
particular women whose voices have not been considered]{.underline}** in
traditional foreign policy analysis and IR.59 [With an increasing number
of states advocating pro-gender norms]{.underline} in foreign policy and
principles [of care and empathy, ethical foundations for
the]{.underline} actual [conduct of foreign policy become important to
analyse.]{.underline} Yet, [theoretical tools developed for such
analysis need to embrace the criticisms that the ethics of care
essentialises women's aptness for care and nurturing, and,]{.underline}
as such [reduces their agency and actual engagements in global politics
and participation public life.]{.underline}60 The emphasis on [care and
relationality]{.underline} also [provide fertile ground for ethically
unpacking the situated contents of a feminist foreign
policy.]{.underline} As mentioned, **[an increasing number of states are
resolutely pushing for a distinct feminist stance on foreign
policymaking]{.underline}** regarding the inclusion and representation
of local women in world politics. [Canada's feminist development
policy]{.underline}, for instance, [is grounded in the assumption that
women and girls have the ability to achieve real change in terms of
sustainable development and peace]{.underline}, even though they are
often the most vulnerable to poverty, violence and climate change. So
[we will work closely with local women's rights groups]{.underline},
particularly [in the areas of sexual and reproductive
health]{.underline} ... we will make sound decisions based on evidence
and closely track our progress, but [in a manner adapted to the needs of
different stakeholders in different contexts.]{.underline}61 [Swedish
feminist foreign policy is grounded in a commitment to
engage]{.underline} with [distinct ethical reflections, experiences,
needs and wants of local populations]{.underline} as a way of gaining
insights and knowledge how [to support local peace, conflict resolution
and the eradication of gendered violence.]{.underline} Moreover, [the
Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs]{.underline} (2015) [highlights the
significance of 'the participation of women and girls as actors in peace
processes]{.underline} in conflict countries, [including by encouraging
parallels to the Swedish network for women mediators]{.underline} and
[supporting local women leaders, women's rights activists, women's
organisations']{.underline} as well as 'ensuring that women and girls
are included and that their experience is taken into account in the
design of mechanisms and systems for early conflict warning and in
conflict analyses'.62 The **[unpacking]{.underline}** of such
**[discursive foreign policy statements enables a critical analysis of
the presence of care values in states' actual foreign policy
practice.]{.underline}** In this way, prevalent inconsistencies in the
making of feminist foreign policy can be identified, which in turn can
show in what ways they may impede its operationalisation in practice.
For instance, [both Canada and Sweden can be criticised for not
sufficiently matching their care for distant]{.underline} other [women
living in conflict or poverty-struck zones with an empathetic commitment
to their own indigenous or marginalised refugee populations. **While
feminist IR theory remains alert to and critical of**]{.underline} the
**[structural underpinnings of]{.underline}** world **[politics, the
ontological relationality of the ethics of care provides a key
contribution because it takes stock of the experiences of]{.underline}**
the **[people at the receiving end of feminist foreign
policy.]{.underline}** In contrast with **[orthodox foreign
policy]{.underline}** practice and theory, which **[tends to disregard
the lived histories of women and colonial subjects]{.underline}**, **[an
ethics of care approach would actively seek to uncover their stories to
enable intersectional and situated analyses of foreign
policy.]{.underline}** [This involves investigating whether states and
other actors actually employ care and empathy as a normative
ideal]{.underline} in their pursuit of foreign, security, defence and
development policies. [States tend to vary in their commitment to such
dialogue]{.underline}, but [this does not mean that a global ethics of
care should be dismissed]{.underline} in the context of foreign and
security policy analysis. Instead **[a critical analysis of
feminist-oriented foreign policy should seek to address the ethical
question how our view of security in global politics would change once
we recognize and accept]{.underline}** ... the ways **[responsibilities
and practices of care]{.underline}** grow out of relations of dependence
and vulnerability of people in the context of complex webs of relations
of responsibility.63 **[This entails exploring]{.underline}** to what
extent the makers of feminist foreign policy take note of **['the
everyday']{.underline}** and whether Robison's notion of **['a feminist
ethics of security' which centres on 'marginalised sites']{.underline}**
has some resonance with actual policy-making.64 [Ethics of care as
foreign policy]{.underline} conduct [is often expressed in notions of
gender-just protection]{.underline} of such marginalised groups, [in
particular, the protection of women and children from gendered violence
and discrimination.]{.underline} Here ethics of care scholar Joan
[Tronto highlights the shift in]{.underline} global [relations from what
previously was a 'right to intervene' and sovereign-based logic to 'the
responsibility to protect' and an ethics of global care.]{.underline}65
We propose here that **[protection, though at times requiring military
means, should]{.underline}** always **[rest on the act of listening to
marginalised voices]{.underline}** -- **[a diplomatic tool that is key
to the successful conduct of feminist foreign policy. A foreign policy,
which builds on the ethics of care]{.underline}** as its foundation,
**[rests on the idea of inclusive and ethical dialogues as well as acts
of listening across borders and intersectional confines.]{.underline}**
Virginia Held holds that **[emotions, such as empathy, sensitivity and
responsiveness, are sentiments that need to be cultivated as a
significant element when making moral decisions.]{.underline}**66
Central to the analysis of feminist foreign policy then is the extent to
which care, the act of listening and dialogical engagement really are
key norms in the implementation of gender-just external relations? [Here
we find Christine Sylvester's]{.underline}67 [concept of empathetic
cooperation particularly useful and closely associated with the ethics
of care.]{.underline}68 **[Empathetic cooperation challenges sovereign
rights and national interests as]{.underline}** the **[sole platforms
for international interactions in favour of empathy across
intersectional and ethical boundaries.]{.underline}** Laura Sjoberg also
suggests that **[emphatic cooperation is a fruitful platform for the
development of a feminist international security ethic, which pays
attention to care and justice as well as]{.underline}** the **[gendered
structures that have led to]{.underline}** the
**[marginalisation]{.underline}** of vulnerable groups across
international society.69 [It may]{.underline} also [lead to 'a form of
knowledge of other persons that draws explicitly on the commonalty of
feelings and experiences]{.underline} to enrich one's understanding of
another in his or her own right'.70 **[If empathy is an expressed
willingness and ability to appreciate the other then empathetic
cooperation is 'a process of positional slippage that occurs when one
listens seriously to]{.underline}** the **[concerns, fears and agendas
of those one is unaccustomed to hearing'.]{.underline}**71 In short, we
argue that **[empathetic cooperation]{.underline}**, as part of the
making of a feminist foreign policy, **[may be a way of opening up for a
global ethic and concrete expressions of politics, which do not
privilege statist interests and]{.underline}** notions of
**[security.]{.underline}** Moreover, **[it moves the agenda towards
human security while respecting cultural difference.]{.underline}**72
Thus, [to explore the presence of empathetic cooperation in the conduct
of feminist and genderbased foreign policy is key to the analysis of
feminist foreign]{.underline} policy and to ethical investigations into
ethically minded foreign policy more broadly.

### S -- Cybersecurity

#### The alt is key---patriarchal norms surrounding cybersecurity prioritize masculine institutions and incentivize victim-blaming, which creates serial policy failure

cybersecurity: design, defence and response. United Nations Institute
for Disarmament Research 2021. Pg 40-41. LJS

Incident response -- organizational measures to handle network
intrusions, attacks, data breaches and other malicious cyber acts -- is
characterized by a hierarchy of priorities. [Studies have shown that the
cybersecurity industry reports on and responds to certain victims
(commercial organizations, governments) that are associated with
"traditional" security and the activities of elite men
disproportionately, and it has a blind spot for threats to civil society
and human security (e.g. non-governmental organizations, educational
institutions and individuals).116]{.underline} As schools,
non-governmental organizations and individuals are more likely to be
concerned with issues of social power, harms and equality, this
prioritization has knock-on gender effects. [The composition, expected
practices and working hours, and workplace culture of incident-response
teams also require a gender analysis]{.underline}. There is some
evidence that "tech support" teams, which are often the first line of
response following a security incident, are predominantly staffed by
men, compounding the association of technical expertise with
masculinity.117 The composition and culture of Computer Emergency
Response Teams (CERTs or CSIRTs) is also a part of cybersecurity
response. Research indicates that CERTs have distinct political
strategies and characteristics, especially at the national and
international levels, and it is possible that these characteristics
include gendered dynamics.118 [Information sharing -- the process of
trusted exchange of information about attacks and other security
incidents, vulnerabilities, and cybersecurity practices -- is also an
essential part of responding to cybersecurity threats. The same
masculine, national defence norms may also impede States and
organizations from sharing information about cyberattacks and system
vulnerabilities.]{.underline} Studies suggest that informal "trust
communities" are the basis for much cybersecurity information sharing,
rather than formal lines of communication between individuals with
similar roles.119 [The informality of these communities, and the
consequent unconscious bias that this permits, means that they may have
lower participation from women and minoritized groups, even when
adjusted for overall proportions in the industry. Cybersecurity response
can also demonstrate an unfortunate gendered dynamic of victim-blaming,
wherein organizations or individuals with cybersecurity defence or
identity-protection measures that are deemed to be "insufficient" are
framed as "asking to be hacked", which shifts responsibility onto the
party that has been harmed, rather than the one who committed
harm.120]{.underline}

### S -- US-China War

#### Only the alt deconstructs international patriarchy -- that resolves the underlying and proximate causes for US-China conflict and encourages a space of dialogue between the two nations while creating unilateral responsibility.

If (R3) is correct, then **[it is possible to envision great state
equality without war in a non-patriarchal international]{.underline}**
system. **[In a system that values care and empathy, actors would be
interested in the collective security]{.underline}** of the world's
citizens. [Such a system would prioritize understanding, communication,
and community.]{.underline} **[A feminist perspective
might]{.underline}** imagine challenging great powers to engage in
empathetic cooperation, and **[suggest that major powers take unilateral
steps to transgress the cycle of violence in international
politics.]{.underline}**120 [Each power would engage in purposive
compromise of values and interests]{.underline} in order [to create
peace]{.underline} between them. In PTT's scenario of potential conflict
between the US and China, then, **[the US should not fear a dissatisfied
China or attempt co-option.]{.underline}** Instead, [it should attempt
to understand the interests, values, and needs of]{.underline} those
[challengers.]{.underline} [If challengers took a similar approach, they
would not have to choose between unattainable satisfaction and perpetual
dissatisfaction.]{.underline} Along these lines, feminists suggest that
**[the US should include China in]{.underline}** deliberative
**[dialogues, treat the Chinese government and people with
empathy]{.underline}** and understanding, **[and show China and other
potential challengers]{.underline}** by example **[that the strong can
defy international system patriarchy unilaterally and stop the cycle of
violence.]{.underline}**121 Feminists have argued that **[inclusive
understanding is key to peaceful coexistence.]{.underline}** Spike
Peterson clarifies that "feminists argue that [the domination of women,
nature, and all who are constructed as 'other' is not a matter of
'essential,' atemporal qualities but of socially constructed,
historically contingent.]{.underline}"122 In other words, **[the voices
of marginalization could serve as a bridge]{.underline}** between
hostile and masculinized states. In these terms, **[a dialogue which
promoted understanding between the US and China]{.underline}** (and
their differentiated citizens) **[would go a long way towards
decreasing]{.underline}** the **[potential for conflict]{.underline}**
between the two great states. Analyzing the Chinese "overtaking" through
gendered lenses These [feminist reformulations of PTT's key hypotheses
provide both alternative understandings of]{.underline} the potential
for [conflict]{.underline} between the US and China [and alternative
futures.]{.underline} PTT suggests that the question of whether or not
that rising will cause conflict between the two states depends on
China's satisfaction or dissatisfaction as it approaches parity with the
US. [A feminist approach suggests]{.underline} that a good deal of the
possibility for [conflict between the US and China might be explained by
gender]{.underline}-related variables. **[The patriarchal]{.underline}**
nature of the **[international system provides an incentive for the US
to]{.underline}** attempt to **[maintain dominance. Such]{.underline}**
a **[system also gives China a motivation to seek]{.underline}** not
parity but **[supremacy.]{.underline}** In addition, **[the cultural
salience of masculinity]{.underline}** in each society [**is manifested
in each state's desire to compete with the other.** This alternative
explanation for the potential competition]{.underline} between the US
and China [suggests alternative solutions.]{.underline}
**[Realists]{.underline}** like Mearsheimer **[suggest a combined
strategy of economic containment]{.underline}** and military
presence,123 and **[power transition theorists suggest attempts to
co-opt China into satisfaction with the existing order.]{.underline}**
Some International [Relations scholars outside of the realist
paradigm]{.underline} have [suggested]{.underline} strategies like GRIT
([graduated reciprocation of tension reduction]{.underline}) in order
[to establish trust]{.underline} between the US and China.124 **[If
gendered competition and international system patriarchy
underlie]{.underline}** the **[competition]{.underline}** between the
two states, however, **[none of these strategies will be
successful.]{.underline}** Mearsheimer's **[containment]{.underline}**
strategy **[will incite more competition]{.underline}**; power
transition theorists' **[co-optation strategy is misdirected since
dissatisfaction]{.underline}** is endemic and **[would not be China's
main motive for making war]{.underline}**; and **[trust-building
solutions without the deconstruction of the masculine
competition]{.underline}** for superiority **[would just be read as
weakness.]{.underline}** Seeing [gender-as-power both helps explain the
potential for conflict]{.underline} between the US and China [and
provides a theoretical and practical alternative]{.underline} to that
competition in recasting the genderings of the state and the
international system. [Some feminists prescribe the strong need to
unilaterally deconstruct the cycle of violence and]{.underline}
masculinized [competition between great powers]{.underline} in the
international arena. **[States would need to recognize conflict's basis
in competition, posturing, and subordination under patriarchy and
deconstruct]{.underline}** that in order to head off violence. Feminist
theorists suggest that [the US and China could come to
terms]{.underline} with the gendered nature of their competition [by
dealing with each other in empathy and in dialogue]{.underline} to try
to find a deeper sense of understanding if not common ground. **[The
path to an empathetic reconstruction]{.underline}** of the relationship
between the US and China **[could begin with]{.underline}** the
**[rejection of]{.underline}** PTT's claim that **[hegemonic
domination]{.underline}** is empirically and normatively valuable.
**[Domination and the resulting subordination]{.underline}**, at the
international level as well as at the personal level, **[are normatively
problematic.]{.underline}** Therefore, **[even if hegemonic dominance
did decrease great power warfare, a feminist approach asks if that would
be a sort of peace]{.underline}** that **[the
international]{.underline}** arena **[would truly thrive
under.]{.underline}**

### S -- Ukraine

#### We control uniqueness -- peacebuilding efforts in Ukraine are incorporating feminist strategies and women's involvement -- the aff paternalistically delegitimates their attempts at a post-conflict transition

in Ukraine," Knowledge for Development (K4D) Helpdesk Report. UK

**[There has been virtually no civil society engagement with the peace
process]{.underline}**, 'due to overstretch and capacity constraints as
well as the lack of opportunities for participation' (Kapur 2016, p. 6;
WILPF 2014, P. 28). However, **[despite the lack of opportunity for
formal participation in the peace process, 'a small number of women
activists living close to the frontline]{.underline}** and in the
eastern regions **[continue to undertake local outreach and confidence
building activities']{.underline}** (Kapur 2016, p. 6). [Women's civil
society organisations have been found to be very interested in engaging
in dialogue processes]{.underline} between people [from western and
eastern Ukraine and in re-establishing former relations with women's
groups in the Russian Federation, including soldiers'
mothers]{.underline} (OSCE 2015, p. 8). **[A number of initiatives were
documented at the beginning of 2015, including the initiative of the
Union of Ukrainian women to encourage women to be appointed to senior
positions in conflict regions]{.underline}**; and [initiatives by
prominent female singers and politicians to highlight the situation in
the conflict areas]{.underline} (Zakharova 2015, p. 25). **[Women have
also engaged in shadow peace talks]{.underline}**, like those in 2015,
organised by the Union of Women of Ukraine, **[which brought together
activists, civil society leaders, volunteers, journalists, public
servants and women directly impacted and displaced by the
fighting]{.underline}** to discuss ways **[to help end the
conflict.]{.underline}** [The participation of women in politics and
peace-making at the local level is slowly increasing]{.underline}
(Fellin 2015, p. 5-6). WILPF (2014, p. 23) have also noted that **[there
is little public space for Ukrainian men to adopt a non-violent position
in opposition to war. Women's groups engaged in conflict resolution and
peacebuilding argue that they need more training for mediators
and]{.underline}** peer-to-peer **[training programmes for those
involved in dialogues on women, peace and security, as well as regular
meeting and exchanges of experiences and resources.]{.underline}** [A
number of initiatives have supported women's participation in
peacebuilding activities.]{.underline} They include a project with
**[the Women's Information Consultative Center aimed at 'increasing the
capacity of women -- especially internally displaced]{.underline}**
women **[and rural women -- to protect themselves,
increase]{.underline}** women's **[empowerment and participation in
decision-making processes]{.underline}**, and **[build and raise
awareness about international documents on women's peace and
security]{.underline}** and mechanisms **[to secure and protect women
during war conflict and political, economic and social crises among
decision-makers in Ukraine]{.underline}**' (Hanssen 2016, p. 59).
[Another initiative, implemented by La Strada in cooperation with the
Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine and relevant local
authorities, aimed to build capacity in peace-building and conflict
resolution]{.underline} and mediation efforts [among conflict-affected
groups and communities with a focus on women and IDP girls]{.underline}
(Hanssen 2016, p. 79). **[Ukrainian women working towards peace have
also engaged in a solidarity dialogue]{.underline}** with women
activists from Bosnia and Herzegovina in June 2016 **[to share
experiences and gain a better understanding of women's contribution to
conflict and post-conflict transition]{.underline}** (Kapur, 2016). The
[Ukrainian activists would like to professionalise their organisations
and strengthen the Ukrainian feminist movement to help make women's
voices in Ukraine stronger]{.underline} (Kapur 2016, p. 8). They feel
that '[women must actively participate in the peace process to ensure
inclusion of their voice, experience and perspective]{.underline} across
all issues' (Kapur 2016, p. 8). It was suggested that [women's
organisations could help build local peace by working to create dialogue
between host communities and IDPs, as well as reaching out to women in
Donetsk and Luhansk]{.underline}, which could **[then link in with
national, regional and international initiatives for
peace]{.underline}** (Kapur 2016, p. 23). At a formal level,
**[Ukraine's 2016 National Action Plan on Women's Peace and Security
aims to increase the participation of women in peacebuilding by
improving the infrastructure and legal environment for women's
participation]{.underline}** in international peacekeeping operations,
and for their service in administrative and combat positions in the
Armed Forces and other national security and defence institutions
(Martsenyuk et al. 2016, p. 182). In addition **[it plans to conduct an
assessment of gendered aspects of conflict prevention and resolution and
promote the women's role in peacebuilding, peacekeeping and

### Epistemology First

#### Prioritize feminist epistemologies---the aff's urgency framing mystifies structural causes and creates serial policy failure

Development, Community, and Environment, with affiliations with Women's
and Gender Studies and Political Science, all at Clark University in

Making Feminist Sense of International Politics. Pg 348-359. LJS

[One of the simplest and most disturbing feminist insights crafted in
recent decades is that "the personal is political."]{.underline} It is a
profound theoretical statement that can be transferred to a T-shirt or
bumper sticker. [Asserting that "the personal is political" is
disturbing, intentionally disturbing, because it means that
relationships we once imagined were (and many of our friends and
colleagues still prefer to think are) private or merely social are in
fact infused with power. Furthermore, those allegedly private, personal
relationships are infused with power that is unequal and backed up by
public authority.]{.underline} But the assertion that "the personal is
political" is like a palindrome, one of those phrases that can be read
backward as well as forward. [Read as "the political is personal," the
assertion suggests that politics is not shaped merely by what happens in
legislative debates, voting booths, political party strategy sessions,
court rooms, or war rooms.]{.underline} While men who dominate public
life in so many countries have told women to stay in the proverbial
kitchen (not travel to workshops in Manila, not organize, not theorize),
those same men have used their myriad forms of public power to construct
private relationships in ways that have bolstered their own masculinized
political control. Without these deliberate gendered maneuvers, men's
hold over political life might be far less secure. Without these
gendered maneuvers, moreover, most men's seeming "expertise" in politics
would look less impressive. A 2013 cross-national survey of citizens'
political knowledge found that in virtually every one of the ten
countries studied, "women know less about politics than men regardless
of how advanced a country is in terms of gender equality."2 [The authors
of the study speculated that this gender gap in political information
might be due to the fact that few women play prominent roles in news
journalism and elite political life, which discourages many women
viewers and readers from seeing how current news accounts are relevant
to themselves. While this possible explanation for the
country-by-country political information gaps appears feasible, a
British feminist journalist analyzing the same ten-country study offered
an additional explanation: perhaps the researchers' definitions and
measures of what counts as "politics" were too narrow.]{.underline}3
Perhaps what many women do pay attention to, and do store information
about, is encompassed by a broader, some might say more realistic, map
of politics---for instance, the availability of affordable child care,
the condition of public parks, the accessibility of public transport,
the readiness of police to treat a woman with respect when she brings a
rape charge, the government's willingness to use sexualized pictures of
local women to lure foreign tourists, and the impunity with which
employers abuse women on the job. [That is, perhaps if the map of what
is counted as political were redrawn by feminist-informed cartographers,
the gap between women's and men's political knowledge would shrink
dramatically. Explaining why any country has the kind of politics it
does should motivate us to be curious about how public life is
constructed out of struggles to define masculinity and
femininity.]{.underline} Accepting that the "political is personal"
prompts one to investigate the politics of marriage, the cheapening of
women's labor, ideologies of masculinity, sexually transmitted diseases,
and homophobia---not as marginal issues but as matters central to the
state. [Doing this kind of research becomes just as serious as studying
military weaponry or taxation policy.]{.underline} In fact, insofar as
the political is personal, the latter categories cannot be fully
understood without taking into account the former. [To make sense of
international politics, we have to read power backward and forward.
Power relations between countries and their governments involve more
than troop maneuvers and diplomatic emails. Read forward, "the personal
is international" insofar as ideas about what it means to be a
"respectable" woman or an "honorable" man have been shaped by colonizing
policies, international trade strategies, and military
doctrines.]{.underline} Today it has almost become a cliché to say that
the world is shrinking, that state boundaries are porous: think of KFC
opening in Shanghai, sushi eaten in Santiago, Cézannes hanging on walls
in Doha, a Korean pop star drawing crowds in New York, and Russian
weaponry propping up a Syrian autocrat. [We frequently persist,
nonetheless, in discussing personal power relationships as if they were
contained by sovereign states. We frequently consider violence against
women without investigating how the global trade in Internet pornography
operates, or how companies offering sex tours and mail-order brides
conduct their business across national borders. Similarly, we try to
explain how women learn to be "feminine" without unraveling the legacies
left by colonial officials who used Victorian ideals of feminine
domesticity to sustain their empires; or we try to trace what shapes
children's ideas about femininity and masculinity without looking at
governments' foreign investment policies that encourage the global
advertising campaigns of such giants as McCann Erickson, BBDO, or
Saatchi and Saatchi.]{.underline} Becoming aware that personal
relationships have been internationalized, however, may make one only
feel guilty for not having paid enough attention to international
affairs. "You should know more about the IMF," "Don't switch channels
when experts start talking about climate change," "Find out where Guam
is." [While useful, this new international attentiveness by itself is
not sufficient. It leaves untouched our conventional presumptions about
just what "international politics" is and where it takes
place.]{.underline} Coming to realize that the "personal is
international" expands the politically attentive audience, but it fails
to transform our understandings of what is happening on the multiple
stages of international politics. [The implications of a feminist
understanding of international politics are thrown into sharper relief
when one reads "the personal is international" the other way around: the
international is personal. This calls for a radical new imagining of
what it takes for governments to ally with each other, to compete with
and wage war against each other]{.underline}. "The international is
personal" implies that governments depend on certain kinds of allegedly
private relationships in order to conduct their foreign affairs.
Governments need more than tax revenues and spy agencies; they also need
wives who are willing to provide their diplomatic husbands with unpaid
services so those men can develop trusting relationships with other
diplomatic husbands. They need not only military hardware but also a
steady supply of women's sexual services, as well as military wives'
gratitude, to convince their male soldiers that they are manly. [To
operate in the international arena, governments seek other governments'
recognition of their sovereignty; but they also depend on ideas about
masculinized dignity and feminized sacrifi ce to sustain that sense of
autonomous nationhood.]{.underline} Thus the international politics of
debt, investment, colonization, decolonization, national security,
diplomacy, trade, and military occupation are far more complicated than
most conventional experts would have us believe. This may appear
paradoxical. Many people, and especially women, are taught that
international politics are too complex, too remote, and too tough for
the so-called feminine mind to comprehend. If a Hillary Clinton, Angela
Merkel, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Michelle Bachelet, or Christine Lagarde
enters, it is presumably because she has learned to "think like a man."
[Conventional analyses stop short of investigating an entire area of
international relations, an area that feminist-informed researchers in
the still-expanding fi eld of gender and international relations are
pioneers in exploring: how states depend on particular artifi cial
constructions of the domestic and private spheres to achieve their
political goals]{.underline}. If we take seriously the politics of
domestic servants, of women living on or near a military base, or of
women who sew Gap and Zara apparel, we discover that international
politics are more complicated than nonfeminist analysts imagine. [This
is worth saying again: explanations of international politics that are
devoid of feminist questioning are too-simple explanations. Such
nonfeminist explanations shy away from complexity. They underestimate
power.]{.underline} A feminist investigatory approach exposes a
remarkable assortment of the kinds of power it takes to make the complex
international political system work the way it currently does.
Admittedly, conventional analysts of interstate relations do talk a lot
about power. In fact, they put power at the center of their
commentaries. These are the sorts of commentaries that are presumed to
be most naturally comprehended by manly men; women, especially those
women presumed to be conventionally feminine, allegedly do not have an
innate taste for either wielding or understanding power. However,
feminist-informed explo rations of agribusiness plantation prostitution,
foreign service corps sexism, and repeated attempts to tame outspoken
nationalist women all reveal that, in reality, it takes much more power
to construct and perpetuate international political relations than we
have been led to believe. [One result of feminists' insight is that they
do not erect false barriers between the fi elds of "security studies"
and "international political economy."]{.underline} Feminists realize
that the actual workings of gendered politics routinely blur these
artifi cial fi elds of investigation. This is why the ten politically
savvy women who might come together for Theresa's imagined Manila
workshop start with their domestic lives. It has taken power to deprive
women of land titles and pressure them to leave home to work as domestic
workers abroad or to stay on banana plantations. It has taken power to
keep women marginalized in their countries' diplomatic corps and out of
the upper reaches of central banks and fi nance ministries. It has taken
power to exclude women from labor bargaining. It has taken power to keep
questions of inequity between local men and women off the agendas of
many nationalist movements in industrialized as well as developing
societies. It has taken power to keep diverse women in their separate
places for the sake of the smooth running of any military base. It has
taken power to ensure that UN treaties do not recognize the rights of
sexual minorities. It has taken power to ensure that the UN treaties
that do take account of violence against women are not implemented. It
has taken power to construct popular cultures---through fi lms,
advertising, school curricula, television, books, music, fashion, the
Internet---that reinforce, rather than subvert, globally gendered
hierarchies. ["The international is personal," combined with a sustained
feminist curiosity about women's lives and the workings of
masculinities, provides a guide to making sense of the WTO, the ILO, the
IMF, the Group of Eight, the Group of Twenty, the World Bank, the EU
Commission, the Vatican, the Qatar emirate, the Chinese Politboro, the
UN Security Council, the International Crimes Court, the African Union,
and the Arab League.]{.underline} "The international is personal" is a
starting point for making sense of Gap, Apple, Disney, Foxconn, Chiquita
Banana, Deutsche Bank, and H&M, as well as the International Committee
of the Red Cross, CARE, OXFAM, and Human Rights Watch. [To make
realistic sense of international politics, we need thorough,
feminist-informed gender analyses of each of these organizations---and
more. One can do a feminist-informed gender analysis of anything. And
each will make us smarter about how this world works, or fails to work.
Taking seriously the assertion that "the international is personal"
means that women---in all their diversity---must be made visible,
analytically visible, in our investigations of every one of these
organizations, and in the relationships between these organizations. If
it is true that cooperative as well as hostile relations between
governments, corporations, and international organizations rely on
constructions of women as symbols, women as providers of emotional
support, women as both unpaid and lowpaid workers, women as voters, and
women as token participants, then it does not make sense to continue
analyzing international politics as if women were a mere
afterthought.]{.underline} It does not make sense to collect ungendered
data on refugees, private security personnel, earthquake victims,
militia members, corporate executives, factory owners, journalists, or
peace negotiators. It does not make sense to treat women as if they made
eye-catching photo images but do not need to be interviewed.
International policy-making circles may at times look like men's clubs,
but international politics as a whole has required women to behave in
certain ways. When enough women have refused to behave in those
prescribed ways, relations between governments and between governments
and corporations have had to change. [That is, women are not just the
objects of power, not merely passive puppets or unthinking victims. As
we have seen, women of different classes and different ethnic groups
have made their own calculations in order to cope with or benefi t from
the current struggles between states]{.underline}. These calculations
result in whole countries becoming related to one another, often in
hierarchical terms. In search of adventure, the physical and
intellectual excitement typically reserved for men, some affluent women
have helped turn other women into exotic landscapes. In pursuit of
meaningful paid careers, some women have settled in their governments'
colonies or hired women from former colonies. Out of a desire to appear
fashionable and bolster their sometimes shaky self-confi dence, many
women have become the prime consumers of products made by women working
for low wages in dangerous factories. And in an effort to measure the
progress they have made toward emancipation in their own societies, some
women have helped legitimize international global pyramids of
"civilization" and "modernity." Therefore, when asking "Where are the
women?"---and following up with "How did they get there?" "Who benefi ts
from their being there?" and "What do they themselves think about being
there?"---one should be prepared for complex answers. Acting out of a
new awareness that women, especially in poorer countries, need to be
made visible---and audible---on the international stage, one can risk
painting over the important dif ferences between women. The widening
economic class differences between Chinese, for instance, are alarming
even Beijing's male political elite. Those gaping inequalities are
sharpening the differences between rural and urban women, between women
married to politically connected businessmen and women working on the
assembly lines in those men's factories. [Noting inequalities among
women is not just a comparative statement---for instance, noting that
urban girls are more likely to reach secondary school than rural girls,
or that affluent women are more likely to have access to the Internet
than working-class women do. It is a comparative statement with
relational consequences. Women's diverse experiences of social
class---as well as of race and ethnicity---can translate into often
surprising differences in understandings of femininity, in marital
economics, in relationships with particular men, and in encounters with
the state]{.underline}. In the United States, China, India, Turkey,
South Africa, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, Malaysia, Iraq, and Egypt, these
widening material and political inequalities between affluent women,
middle-class women, urban poor women, and rural poor women, especially
when exacerbated by racism and ethnocentrism, present daunting
challenges for any women who are working to create and sustain a vibrant
national or transnational women's movement. Creating transnational
women's banana workers' groups, launching the International Domestic
Workers' Network, building a transnational alliance to lobby for a
gender-conscious arms-trade treaty, organizing a transnational network
of women living near overseas American military bases, creating unions
for women garment workers, sustaining a transnational network of
feminists living under patriarchal religious laws, building a UN-focused
alliance that can take on the "unholy alliance"--- not one of these
efforts has been easy. And every day there are those who act to defend
their local or global stake in having diverse women lose trust in each
other, withdraw support from each other. One might make a list of those
patriarchal stakeholders, those people who have come to rely on women's
fragmentation. Not all the people on the list will be corporate moguls
and political autocrats. [Male officials who make foreign policy might
prefer to think of themselves as dealing with high fi nance or military
strategy, but in reality they have self-consciously designed
immigration, tourism, labor, foreign service, cultural, and
military-base policies in order to divide and control
women]{.underline}. They rarely admit it, but they have acted as though
their government's or organization's place in world affairs has hinged
on how women behaved. Uncovering these efforts has exposed men as men.
[International politics have relied not only on the manipulation of
femininity's multiple meanings but also on the manipulation of ideas
about masculinities]{.underline}. Ideas about adventure, modernity,
civilization, progress, expertise, rationality, stability, growth, risk,
trust, and security have been legitimized by certain kinds of
masculinized values, systems, and behavior. That is one of the reasons
that each of these ideas has become so potent. Frequently, male
government officials and company executives seek to control women in
order to optimize their infl uence over other men: men as husbands,
voters, migrant workers, soldiers, diplomats, intelligence operatives,
plantation and factory managers, editors, and bankers. Thus,
understanding the international workings of masculinity is important to
making feminist sense of international politics. Men's sense of their
own manhood has derived from their perceptions both of other men's
masculinity and of the femininities of women of different races and
social classes. [Thus a caveat: one cannot make adequate sense of the
international politics of masculinity by avoiding paying close attention
to women and femininity. Ideas about masculinities---the full array of
masculinities---have been crafted out of ideas about, myths about, and
uncertainties about femininities and about actual women]{.underline}. To
conduct a reliable investigation of masculinity, one must take women
seriously. Climate change, capitalist globalization, the new arms race,
and widening gaps between rich and poor---it is tempting to plunge into
the discussion of any of these contemporary issues without bothering to
ask, "Where are the women?" [In fact, the more urgent the issue---"New
York will soon be under water!" "China's military build up is going to
set off a world war!"---the more reasonable it seems to not ask "Where
are the women?" In patriarchal hands, "urgency" is the enemy of feminist
investigation. The previous chapters suggest, however, that these urgent
issues demand a gendered analysis precisely because they are urgent,
because they call for the fullest, most realistic understandings. As
feminist environmental researchers and activists already are revealing,
the causes of climate change, for example, and not just its effects, can
be realistically tracked only if one exposes the workings of ideas about
manliness and femininity and the relations between women and men, each
fostered by the deliberate uses of political power. So too can the
causes of the new arms race, exploitive globalization, and the widening
gaps between rich and poor.]{.underline} Theresa, Chobi, Takazato, Iris,
and the other workshop participants are now, we can imagine, deep into
their discussions. The deeper they dig, the more candid they become with
each other. They have tried to create an atmosphere of trust, one that
encourages each woman to be honest about her worries and puz zles.
Together, they are on a journey to understand how banana plantations
work, how garment subcontractors perceive women seamstresses, whose
security a military base protects, and why women and men who employ
domestic workers do not see them as real workers. [Every time the
conversation slips into abstractions, one of the women pulls it back to
women's complex everyday realities. This is what making feminist sense
of international politics sounds like.]{.underline}

#### Feminist epistemology for peacebuilding

**Julian et al. 19** -- Rachel Julian & Robin Redhead, School of Social
Sciences, Leeds Beckett University; Berit Bliesemann de Guevara,
Department of International Politics, Aberystwyth University. "From
expert to experiential knowledge: exploring the inclusion of local
experiences in understanding violence in conflict," Peacebuilding,
Volume 7, Issue 2. Routledge, 2019.

**[A feminist epistemology asks why socially marginalised groups are
absent from the]{.underline}** design and **[conduct of research about
them and seeks to transform those]{.underline}** political **[practices
that legitimate this exclusion.]{.underline}**23 **[This involves the
inclusion of the researched in the research, revealing the power
dynamics between researcher and researched]{.underline}** and
[**stressing the value of local knowledges or
experiences.**24]{.underline} [It demands scrutiny of our own practices
as scholars as well as a commitment to transformative
politics.]{.underline}25 **[Knowledge is understood as]{.underline}** an
**[intersubjective]{.underline}** process, **[it is produced through
encounters with others.]{.underline}**26 [This means that knowledge is
'not just "out there", but the result of a particular
engagement]{.underline} in a particular context as a continuous way of
"becoming"', 27 **[highlighting the crucial role the
researcher-researched relationship plays in (conflict) knowledge
production]{.underline}** -- a role that **[is usually written out of
conflict analyses.]{.underline}** The **[feminist
approaches]{.underline}** we draw on **[highlight everyday experience as
crucial]{.underline}** to **[knowledge.]{.underline}** [Feminist
ethnographies]{.underline}, for instance, [consider the 'everyday'
activities of people to show the complexities of local-global
relations.]{.underline}28 [They 'listen to the unsaid']{.underline} [29
in the everyday and produce 'sincere and reliable
knowledge'.]{.underline} 30 **[The feminist approach accounts for
embodied knowledge]{.underline}**: how we make sense of the world based
on our own experiences in it.31 [While experience is universal in the
sense]{.underline} that [we all experience everyday social
reality]{.underline}, **[it is]{.underline}** also **[personal in that
it cannot be generalised]{.underline}** or categorised by an external
actor. It incorporates what is of central importance to the person
having the experience, including the perceptions, narratives, myths and
relationships that surround it. In much the same way that the study of
practice challenges the norms of institutionalised politics, **[an
understanding of the importance of everyday experience challenges the
dominance of the outside expert in creating knowledge about conflict,
violence and peace]{.underline}** in several ways. Inspired by these
insights of feminist methodologies,32 underpinning the research agenda
of 'Raising Silent Voices' was a strong commitment to **[developing and
valuing experiential knowledge]{.underline}**, which [**redefined what
counted as 'knowledge' in understanding conflicts.** Feminist approaches
provide us with]{.underline} at least [two reasons why including
everyday experiences into our analyses]{.underline} of violent conflict
[enhances understanding.]{.underline} Firstly, **[experiences cannot be
categorised by group]{.underline}** ([e.g. the experience of all
women]{.underline}), **[but]{.underline}** rather **[need to be treated
as a set of narratives from which we can learn more and]{.underline}**
which may **[challenge the assumptions]{.underline}** or systematising
analyses **[of outsiders.]{.underline}** Thus, understanding that
**[there are different knowledges that emerge from lived
experiences]{.underline}**, and that all **[these experiences have
value]{.underline}**, is essential. This also means that [not all
specific or personal experiences can be represented solely by community
leaders]{.underline} or civil society representatives. [Civil society
and community leaders are not interest-free conduits of
knowledge]{.underline}, but [their position is already a manifestation
and a potential source of the power struggles in the conflict
area.]{.underline} This is an important insight when considering that
community and **[civil society leaders]{.underline}** feature
prominently in conflict analysis approaches, where these actors are
**[often taken to be able to speak on behalf of those they
represent.]{.underline}** **[Feminist approaches remind
us]{.underline}** that **[we need]{.underline}** many **[experiential
knowledges]{.underline}** in order [**to achieve a fuller picture, not
all of which can be represented by 'local elites'.** Studying 'ordinary
people' rather than starting with 'local elites']{.underline} promises
to unearth insights, knowledges and strategies that [currently tend to
remain hidden in conflict analysis]{.underline} which starts with
outsider views. Indeed, **[what emerges from]{.underline}** our
**[research is that those who live amidst violence, seek to
protect]{.underline}** people, **[or create peace, are far from
'ordinary', but are courageous, creative and extraordinary people who
have interwoven relationships]{.underline}** and protection **[into
their everyday lives in order to deal with the fears, insecurities and
threats they face. Using a feminist conception of knowledge production
opens up spaces to allow]{.underline}** for **[different actors and
actions to form]{.underline}** part of the **[knowledge that is seen as
valid]{.underline}** in these circumstances. **[This may]{.underline}**
ultimately **[have a positive impact on everyday peace
strategies]{.underline}**, for **[when someone is recognised as an
actor, they are empowered with the capability to act]{.underline}** and
with that comes recognition of the validity of their actions. In this
idea of inclusion of local agency and people's everyday actions, [we are
not following the much debated 'participatory' models, which can
reproduce hierarchies of power and expertise]{.underline} in their own
right, but rather the idea of **['capacity recognition']{.underline}**,
33 which **[begins with the understanding that people already have
agency]{.underline}**, that **[their actions have value and importance
in the local contex]{.underline}**t, and that **[people's everyday
experiences based on these actions make them valuable holders of
experiential knowledge that gives them]{.underline}** the **[capacity to
act knowingly]{.underline}** (i.e. with an awareness of what they are
doing). **[This form of empowerment]{.underline}**-through-inclusion
**[raises]{.underline}** the **[significance of everyday activities to
more than a local matter]{.underline}**,34 **[and writes them into the
dominant narratives and practices of peacebuilding.]{.underline}**
Secondly, **[experiences are important]{.underline}** for conflict
analyses **[because they are likely to defy any uncritical form of
universal]{.underline}** or generalizable **[narrative
coherence.]{.underline}** By their virtue, [experiences are diverse,
producing many knowledges.]{.underline} [Including the diversity of
experiences -- including past, present and future thinking -- into
conflict analyses, reveals how people's]{.underline} varied
[interpretations and perceptions create a set of different
knowledges]{.underline}, which all contribute to understanding the web
of conflict and potentials for peace. [People living amidst violent
conflict know the significance of details]{.underline} -- [that it
matters what they wear, which symbols are of importance]{.underline} in
identifying allegiances, [which routes, roads and paths are safe and at
which times, who is aligned with whom, and how to find safe escape
routes]{.underline} when necessary. **[They see conflict and violence in
their many forms, and they]{.underline}** also **[know what peace looks
like.]{.underline}** Especially **[for work in the areas of protection
and conflict transformation,]{.underline}** such [**experiential
micro-insights are invaluable.** This leads us to the question of how to
access experiential knowledge methodologically, without
reproducing]{.underline} the power [hierarchies]{.underline} inherent in
outsider-expert knowledge production discussed above. **[While
ethnographic approaches seem promising]{.underline}** as a way of
knowing experiences and are now used more frequently in peacebuilding
studies,35 Macaspac has shown that most of this **[ethnographic research
still revolves around the experience of researchers from the Global
North]{.underline}**, thus **[perpetuating the outsider-expert view on
conflict]{.underline}** at the cost of a more meaningful inclusion of
local experiential knowledge.36 Furthermore, [ethnography usually
presupposes a longer-term engagement]{.underline} with 'the field' in
which the ethnography takes place, [thus making this methodology
difficult to realise within the time and financial constraints of
international organisations' project work.]{.underline} **[Critical
peace and conflict studies scholars have provided]{.underline}** some
**[ideas on how to foreground]{.underline}** the centrality of **[local
people's knowledge and experiences]{.underline}** (rather than that of
the Northern researcher) in violent conflict and conflict
transformation. **[These include]{.underline}** approaches based on
**[reflective practice,]{.underline}**37 **[empowerment and emancipation
through listening,]{.underline}**38 **[and patience and
humility.]{.underline}**39 Lederach has used some of these approaches in
his argument that [some people in the midst of conflicts can become key
catalysts and produce dramatic results]{.underline}, describing them as
'critical yeast', that is, people who are engaged in constant and
growing 'web-weaving' (or building of relationships between people) to
make them connected and stronger.40 **[Ideas of reflexivity,
listening,]{.underline}** critical yeast **[and
web-weaving]{.underline}** all **[provide clues for how we can re-think
peace and conflict studies in ways that give primacy to local
experiences and]{.underline}** overlap with **[feminist
epistemology.]{.underline}** A shared insight is that **[revealing
experiential knowledge requires research methods which involve trust
and]{.underline}** a **[recognition of]{.underline}** the **[power or
agency of the local everyday experience.]{.underline}** Standard [social
science methods often find their limits when applied to
topics]{.underline} that involve complex or strong [experiences,
emotions and/or cultural taboos]{.underline} and shame, [which may
resist objectification in language.]{.underline} For one, human
**[knowledge constitutes more than just that which can be put into
words]{.underline}**, or as Polanyi writes about tacit knowledge[: 'The
fact that we can possess knowledge that is unspoken is]{.underline} of
course a [common-place]{.underline} and [so is the fact
that]{.underline} [we must know something yet unspoken before we can
express it in words.']{.underline} 41 Furthermore, health and psychology
research suggests that **[people may find it hard to voice traumatic or
tabooed experiences, especially in front of others]{.underline}**, or
that they simply lack the words to describe how an experience makes them
feel, to make the unheard and invisible heard.42 Sexual violence,
torture and other common **[conflict-related experiences are prone to
fall into this category]{.underline}**, but also situations that do not
constitute an unspeakable issue in one culture (e.g. that of the aid
worker) may resist direct reporting in the context of different cultural
conventions and norms.43 **[Methods to reveal experiential
knowledge]{.underline}** thus **[ideally need to create safe space for
sharing and provide tools that empower people to do so.]{.underline}**44
**[Exploring experiential knowledge]{.underline}** also **[involves
revealing and working to mitigate power relations between researcher and
researched]{.underline}**, since t[he use of methods that do not
challenge power would risk perpetuating]{.underline} the [norms created
by 'external experts']{.underline} and encourage local people to 'just
tell you want they think you want to know'. Therefore, **[overcoming the
shortfalls of outsider/expert methods is the task of studies that try to
include experiential knowledges of ordinary people living]{.underline}**
amidst violent conflict. In 'Raising Silent Voices' we have developed a
methodology that achieves inclusion. It is to this we will now turn.

### A2 Policy Good

#### Policy fails to break down patriarchal structures---only the alt can solve the root cause

**Shekhawat 21**

Seema, phd, the India Centre Fellow at the University of Central
Florida. "Patriarchy is the Constraint: Resolution 1325 Two Decades
Later." Accord. 4/21/2021.

LJS

The reality, if put alongside the theory of UNSCR 1325, offers a dismal
global scenario. Largely, Resolution 1325's agenda of protection,
representation and participation has not translated into aspired
development. [Notwithstanding the intentions of Resolution 1325, women
largely remain undervalued in peacebuilding. Their under-representation
in peace processes is a harsh reality, despite NAPs and legislation in
several states.]{.underline} The gender insensitivity in peacemaking
processes in Africa, and elsewhere, reflects a critical scenario where
the implementation of the resolution remains constrained. In October
2020, the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) and the UN Office of the
Special Adviser on Africa called for greater inclusion of women in peace
processes. It was argued that "\[d\]espite the notable achievements by
African women, their contribution to the four pillars of UNSCR 1325,
namely conflict prevention, peacekeeping, conflict resolution, and
peacebuilding, still needs to be strengthened".\[12\] For instance, in
16 African peace mediation processes between 1992 and 2011, only two had
5% female signatories, and only three of the 16 processes had female-led
mediators, according to the AU Special Envoy on WPS. In addition,
African countries are lagging behind in developing or adapting NAPs on
UNSCR 1325. The APRM study on Governance, Gender and Peacebuilding
reveals that in some African regions, only a quarter of countries have
NAPs on UNSCR 1325.\[13\] [What is hindering effective gender
mainstreaming in peace processes in Africa and elsewhere? Primarily, the
scholarship argues that the representation of women merely as victims
and not as active agents of change is problematic.]{.underline} Laura
Shepherd problematises Resolution 1325 to conclude that it and other UN
documents "permit the violent reproduction of gender".\[14\] [The
representation of women in UN documents rely on "an essentialist
definition that allows male decision-makers to keep them in the
subordinated position of victims, thus removing their agency," argues
Nadine Puechguirbal.\[15\] For Judy El-Bushra, "essentializing women as
wives, mothers and nurses excludes them from the world of active players
and decision-makers."]{.underline}\[16\] A deconstruction of the
language of Resolution 1325 and other resolutions certainly brings forth
the perpetuation of the gender assumption of women as primarily
vulnerable victims. [While conceding that this gendered stereotype
prohibits gender equality, it must also be argued that gender equality
is majorly constrained by a sociocultural setup that is highly
patriarchal. There is something inherently wrong -- beyond text and
language -- within the societal context that needs to be corrected to
promote gender equality in peacebuilding and all other areas. The highly
masculinised sociocultural structure has to be changed to bring the
desired outcomes. Until existing highly gendered power structures in
society and polity are challenged and corrected, all attempts to tackle
gender inequities -- however genuine -- will merely at the best retain,
if not multiply, the existing gendered realities]{.underline}. Women
remain deprived of the roles of decision-makers and effectively
contributing to peace and security, not because of the linguistic
constraints of UN resolutions and documents but because of the
deep-rooted patriarchal social environment. Hence, one then reinforces
the other in a gendered oppression cycle. Patriarchy is deep-rooted.
[Irrespective of gender, positions of power do not necessarily make
people less patriarchal]{.underline}. States run by patriarchal
leadership would, at the most, institute cosmetic changes; changes that
may not uproot existing sociocultural norms. At the international and
national level, masculinised contexts are also highly visible. In such
scenarios, expecting a desired change through mere UN resolutions may
not be practical. The typical patriarchal mindset is predominantly
visible in traditional contexts. Women in traditional societies are
highly constrained to claim their public space. [Patriarchal norms are
insidious, known for their constant reinventions to ensure their
survival.\[17\] Reinventing itself even amidst claims of its demise,
patriarchy remains omnipresent, only with varying intensity, in
pre-conflict, during conflict and post-conflict situations in
traditional societies. Until gender discriminatory social constructions
are challenged and subdued, resolutions -- such as 1325 -- will remain
more theory and less practice]{.underline}. The roots of patriarchy and
the consequent gendered constraints for women lie in the concept of
superiority of a particular gender. [For women, claiming public space in
peacemaking processes in an atmosphere of patriarchal domination, where
men are groomed to believe in their "natural" physical and mental
superiority, is a daunting task. The socially constructed gendered
hierarchies remain unchallenged in all situations, and this mental
construction is ingrained across genders]{.underline}. In the
reiteration of the patriarchal falsities and the belief that these are
natural, gendered discrimination thrives. In such a scenario,
understanding and acknowledging the gender discrimination and, more
importantly, transgressing the established gendered norms to claim their
rights as peacebuilders, is problematic for women. I have been
documenting the impact of patriarchy on women in conflict situations in
Asia and Africa for over a decade.\[18\] A cursory look at the responses
of some male and female respondents from Kashmir, Kathmandu and Manipur
helps to understand that ushering change through the passage of
resolutions such as 1325 is problematic unless the root causes of gender
discrimination are addressed. This assertion stands true, more or less,
for all traditional societies, including African ones. [The opinion of
most male ex-combatants was that women are merely good followers, not
leaders]{.underline}. Through reasons such as women's inability to be
away from home, their unwillingness to get involved in political
processes, their safety and other related issues, women's absence from
peace processes was projected as normal. When I posed a question
regarding women's absence from peace attempts to an armed group leader,
the response was: "Women have to perform several routine work. They are
busy in homes and families. They don't have time to travel and work for
peace outside their homes."\[19\] [There is an intrinsic patriarchal
resistance on the part of men even to acknowledge the significant
position of women in conflict; consequently, women's exclusion from
peace processes is considered normal]{.underline}. A male ex-combatant
noted: "Women helped us... there are certain cultural norms and women
should adhere to them. This would maintain peace in society as well as
family. Women's limited presence in the public space for a cause does
not give them liberty to cross their traditional boundaries."\[20\]
"Women are happier in their homes and families. Women have no
understanding of issues such as war and peace. They are also not
interested in participating in formal peacemaking. They contribute to a
protest movement when they are asked to do so and go back when their job
is over," argued another male respondent.\[21\] "Women are natural
'healers' and 'pacifiers', but not decision-makers. I do not think
involving women in peace negotiations is necessary. During a conflict,
they are followers... they do what they are told to do... men initiate a
conflict and end that, women are merely players. It is not an issue of
equality but that of ability. Women have no capability to negotiate
formal peacemaking," asserted another male combatant.\[22\] Yet another
male respondent stated: "Women prefer peace, but they cannot negotiate
peace. Preferring peace and negotiating peace are not the same."\[23\]
[Interestingly, the majority of female respondents echoed the opinions
of their male counterparts.]{.underline} "Women are led. They do not
lead. They have no capability to make important decisions," said a
respondent.\[24\] "What can we do?" is the often-repeated response by
women. [Most accepted their marginalisation as normal and
natural]{.underline}. Only a few argued that women should be part of
decision-making processes. To quote Rita Manchanda: "Part of the
difficulty of making women's activism in peace building visible and
therefore mainstreaming gender in the political activity of peace
agreements and the actual planning for a society's reconstruction, is
that women themselves see their activity as non political and an
extension of their domestic concerns and 'stretched roles'. Moreover,
women's visibility is further obscured by the fact that their language
of support and resistance flows from their cultural experience,
especially of being disempowered."\[25\] Conclusion [Gender-based
exclusion of women from peace processes primarily originates from
sociocultural constraints, the result of a larger deep-rooted problem of
patriarchal norms that severely constrain women's presence in the public
space and, more importantly, in power positions]{.underline}. An
attitude reversal through sustained sensitivity awareness campaigns and
education is needed if Resolution 1325 is to be effectively implemented.
An attitudinal change is necessary. At times, to be politically correct,
women are included in peace processes or paragraphs in a document, but
the need of the time is to go beyond symbolism and ensure the genuine
involvement of women. States and societies have to come together to look
beyond the established norms to achieve the significant participation of
women in peace and security.

[The realm of international peace and security remained resistant to
advocacy around women's rights and gender until relatively
recently]{.underline}. A case in point is the fact that the UN Security
Council with primary responsibility for the maintenance of international
peace and security under the UN Charter did not consider gender issues
until 2000 and the adoption of UNSCR 1325 on WPS. The internal politics
of the Security Council were undoubtedly crucial to realise the adoption
of this Resolution. [Yet, the Resolution did not emerge in a vacuum with
wider developments in global politics helping to make it
possible]{.underline} (Tryggestad 2009: 542). The end of the Cold War
also contributed, freeing the Security Council from its deadlock and
allowing space for the emergence of gender onto the Security Council's
agenda. [Further, the very type of thematic resolution which UNSCR 1325
is an example of would have been unthinkable during the Cold War but
gained traction in the late 1990s and early 2000s]{.underline}
(Tryggestad, 2009: 543). [It is therefore salient to consider the wider
global political landscape which contributed to the adoption of UNSCR
1325. Superpower politics during the Cold War shaped feminist advocacy
at the UN and contributed to isolating the issue of 'violence against
women' from the international agenda]{.underline} (Harrington, 2011).
This has a significant impact on the efficacy of transnational feminist
advocacy. [For example, it led to the isolation of US women's groups
from more radical (and socialist) groups around the globe but also
within the US itself. And while Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs)
could apply for 'consultative status' to give them access to UN debates
and meetings from 1946, some of these NGOs inevitably became subject to
intervention by the US and Soviet Union]{.underline} (Harrington, 2011:
561). A case in point is the communist Women's International Democratic
Federation which the Soviet Union used as a vehicle to promote Soviet
propaganda (Weigand, 2002: 49). When women's rights were discussed in a
UN context, Cold War politics and the dichotomy between East and West
defined the nature of discussion. At the 1975 UN World Conference on
Women in Mexico, the Soviet Union wanted to debate a wide range of
issues, including capitalism. In contrast, the US wanted to narrow
discussion to women's legal equality (Ghodsee cited in Harrington, 2011:
563). [At the same, gender issues remained marginal to 'everyday' Cold
War politics]{.underline}. The US and Soviet Union did not criticise
each other over gender issues, even when there was a case to do so. This
is despite the fact that the US was drawing upon women's rights to
oppose other regimes at the time (Enloe, 1989: 57). This silencing is
particularly visible in relation to their respective international
interventions in Afghanistan in the 1980s. For example, the US did not
draw attention to the hypocrisy of the Soviet Union purporting to
protect Afghan women, while the Red Army used prostitutes and
perpetrated sexual violence. Likewise, the Soviet Union (and UN
recognised NGOs) did not point out that the US, in supporting the Afghan
Mujahedeen, was supporting a patriarchal regime pitted against one
advancing women's rights (Moghadam cited in Harrington, 2011: 563). [The
end of the Cold War appeared to open up space for the international
community to consider women's rights as an issue of international peace
and security. However, the issues considered remained limited. This
period of US hegemony coincided with the US emerging as a women's rights
champion, albeit supporting a narrow remit of issues]{.underline}. It
was human trafficking, wartime rape and domestic violence which became
prominent issues for the women's sector at the UN (Harrington, 2011:
565). While Joachim has argued that this represented domestic feminist
lobbying finding alignment with the Clinton administration's world views
(Joachim, 2003: 259), Harrington urges caution. [She argues that
violence against women emerged as an issue against the 'new wars'
discourse because it provided a reason for policing and
surveillance]{.underline} (Harrington, 2011: 566). [Violence against
women had become embedded within the militarised project of democracy
promotion and the accompanying political and economic transformation it
advocates. Women's rights and gender issues were included
instrumentally. They provided a means for states and institutions such
as NATO to 'criminalise' their military targets through the 'new wars'
doctrine pitting 'alliances of democratic state and non-state actors
against militia that control populations through rape and other forms of
bodily atrocity']{.underline} (Harrington, 2011: 566). [This dichotomy
between the democratic West and the enemy 'other' also found a gendered
articulation in the War on Terror. Bush, and later Obama, drew on a
masculinist protectionist logic in their discourse on the War on
Terror]{.underline} (Messerschmidt, 2016: 167). For example, the 2001
US-led intervention in Afghanistan drew on the emancipation of Afghan
women as a supplementary justification. The logic invoked a rationale
that to defend our universal civilisation we must rescue Afghan women
(Cooke, 2002: 485--6). Ultimately, the implication of women's rights in
the 'geopolitical manoeuvrings of powerful global actors' makes the
invocation of the 'principled politics solidarity' extremely problematic
(Kandiyoti, 2007: 505). [As Harrington (2011: 567) argues, it
'contributes to a hegemonic conflation of women's equality with
"Western" (or Northern) civilization, and women's oppression with an
undeveloped "rest", obscuring "Western" agency in both male privilege
and violence against women'.]{.underline}

### A2 Retrenchment/Transition Wars

#### U.S. hegemony has already met its end -- ascendance of regional powers, abandoning international agreements, and alienation of long-term allies -- the very fact that we haven't had a great power conflict proves its not zero-sum.

**[Just as American hegemony grew in the]{.underline}** early
19**[90s]{.underline}** while no one was noticing, **[so]{.underline}**
in the late 1990s **[did the forces that would undermine
it]{.underline}**, even as people had begun to speak of the United
States as "the indispensable nation" and "the world's sole superpower."
**[First and foremost, there was the rise of China.]{.underline}** [It
is easy to see in retrospect that Beijing would become the only serious
rival to Washington]{.underline}, but it was not as apparent a quarter
century ago. [Although China had grown speedily since the]{.underline}
19[80s, it had done so from a very low base.]{.underline} Few countries
had been able to continue that process for more than a couple of
decades. China's strange mixture of capitalism and Leninism seemed
fragile, as the Tiananmen Square uprising had revealed. But **[China's
rise persisted, and the country became the new great
power]{.underline}** on the block, one **[with the might and the
ambition to match the United States.]{.underline}**
**[Russia]{.underline}**, for its part, **[went]{.underline}** from
being both weak and quiescent in the early 1990s **[to being a
revanchist power]{.underline}**, a spoiler **[with enough capability and
cunning to be disruptive.]{.underline}** [With two major global players
outside the U.S.-constructed international system, the world had entered
a post-American phase.]{.underline} Today, **[the United
States]{.underline}** is still the most powerful country on the planet,
but it **[exists in a world of global and regional powers that can---and
frequently do---push back. The 9/11 attacks and the rise of Islamic
terrorism played a dual role]{.underline}** in the decline of U.S.
hegemony. At first, **[the attacks seemed to galvanize
Washington]{.underline}** and mobilize its power. In 2001, the United
States, [still larger economically than the next five countries put
together, chose to ramp up its annual defense]{.underline} spending by
an amount---almost \$50 billion---that was larger than the United
Kingdom's entire yearly defense budget. [When Washington intervened in
Afghanistan, it was able to get overwhelming support]{.underline} for
the campaign, including from Russia. Two years later, [despite many
objections, it was still able to put together a large international
coalition for an invasion of Iraq.]{.underline} The early years of this
century marked the high point of the American imperium, as **[Washington
tried to remake]{.underline}** wholly alien nations---**[Afghanistan and
Iraq---thousands of miles away, despite the rest of the world's
reluctant acquiescence or active opposition. Iraq]{.underline}** in
particular **[marked a turning point.]{.underline}** **[The United
States embarked on a war of choice despite misgivings]{.underline}**
expressed in the rest of world. It tried to get the UN to rubber-stamp
its mission, and when that proved arduous, it dispensed with the
organization altogether. **[It ignored the Powell
Doctrine]{.underline}**---the idea, promulgated by General Colin Powell
while he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Gulf War,
**[that a war was worth entering only if vital national interests were
at stake and overwhelming victory assured.]{.underline}** [The Bush
administration insisted that]{.underline} the vast challenge of
[occupying Iraq could be undertaken with a small number of
troops]{.underline} and a light touch. [Iraq, it was said, would pay for
itself.]{.underline} And once in Baghdad, **[Washington decided to
destroy the Iraqi state]{.underline}**, disbanding the army and purging
the bureaucracy, **[which produced chaos and helped fuel an
insurgency.]{.underline}** Any one of these mistakes might have been
overcome. But [together they ensured that Iraq became a costly fiasco.
**After 9/11, Washington made major, consequential decisions that
continue to haunt it**]{.underline}, but it made all of them hastily and
in fear. **[It saw itself as in mortal danger, needing to do whatever it
took to defend itself]{.underline}**---[from invading Iraq to spending
untold sums on homeland security to employing torture.]{.underline} [The
rest of the world saw a country that was experiencing a kind of
terrorism]{.underline} that [many had lived with for years]{.underline}
and [yet was thrashing around]{.underline} like a wounded lion, [tearing
down international alliances and norms.]{.underline} **[In its first two
years, the]{.underline}** George W. **[Bush administration walked away
from more international agreements than any previous administration
had.]{.underline}** (Undoubtedly, **[that record has now been surpassed
under President Donald Trump.]{.underline}**) **[American behavior
abroad during the Bush administration shattered the]{.underline}** moral
and political **[authority of the United States, as long-standing allies

### Extinction First

#### Existential threats outweigh 

**GPP 17**

"Existential Risk: Diplomacy and Governance," Global Priorities Project,
2017,
<https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Existential-Risks-2017-01-23.pdf>

1.2. THE ETHICS OF EXISTENTIAL RISK In his book Reasons and Persons,
Oxford philosopher Derek Parfit advanced an influential argument about
the importance of avoiding extinction: I believe that if we destroy
mankind, as we now can, this outcome will be much worse than most people
think. [Compare three outcomes: (1) Peace. (2) A nuclear war that kills
99% of the world's existing population. (3) A nuclear war that kills
100%.]{.underline} (2) would be worse than (1), and (3) would be worse
than (2). Which is the greater of these two differences? [Most people
believe that the greater difference is between (1) and (2).]{.underline}
[I believe that the difference between (2) and (3) is very much
greater]{.underline}. \... [The Earth will remain habitable for **at
least another billion years**.]{.underline} [Civilization began only a
few thousand years ago.]{.underline} [If we do not destroy mankind,
these few thousand years may be only **a tiny fraction** of the whole of
civilized human history.]{.underline} [The difference between (2) and
(3) may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction and all of the
rest of this history.]{.underline} [If we compare this possible history
to a day, what has occurred so far is only a **fraction of a
second**.65]{.underline} In this argument, it seems that Parfit is
assuming that the survivors of a nuclear war that kills 99% of the
population would eventually be able to recover civilisation without
long-term effect. As we have seen, this may not be a safe assumption --
but for the purposes of this thought experiment, the point stands. [What
makes existential catastrophes especially bad is that they would
"**destroy the future**," as]{.underline} another Oxford philosopher,
Nick [Bostrom, puts it.]{.underline}66 [This future could potentially be
extremely long and full of flourishing, and would therefore have
extremely large value.]{.underline} In standard risk analysis, when
working out how to respond to risk, we work out the expected value of
risk reduction, by weighing the probability that an action will prevent
an adverse event against the severity of the event. [Because the value
of preventing existential catastrophe is so vast, even a tiny
probability of prevention has huge expected value.]{.underline}67 Of
course, there is persisting reasonable disagreement about ethics and
there are a number of ways one might resist this conclusion.68
Therefore, it would be unjustified to be overconfident in Parfit and
Bostrom's argument. [In some areas, government policy does give
significant weight to future generations.]{.underline} For example, in
assessing the risks of nuclear waste storage, governments have
considered timeframes of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even a
million years.69 Justifications for this policy usually appeal to
principles of intergenerational equity according to which future
generations ought to get as much protection as current generations.70
Similarly, widely accepted norms of sustainable development require
development that meets the needs of the current generation without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs.71 [However, when it comes to existential risk, it would seem that
we fail to live up to principles of intergenerational
equity.]{.underline} [Existential catastrophe would not only give future
generations less than the current generations; **it would give them
nothing**.]{.underline} Indeed, [reducing existential risk plausibly has
a quite low cost for us in comparison with the huge expected value it
has for future generations.]{.underline} In spite of this, relatively
little is done to reduce existential risk. [Unless we give up on norms
of intergenerational equity, they give us a strong case for
significantly increasing our efforts to reduce existential
risks.]{.underline} 1.3[. WHY EXISTENTIAL RISKS MAY BE SYSTEMATICALLY
UNDERINVESTED IN, AND THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY]{.underline} [In spite of the importance of existential risk
reduction, it probably receives less attention than is
warranted.]{.underline} As a result, concerted international cooperation
is required if we are to receive adequate protection from existential
risks. 1.3.1. Why existential risks are likely to be underinvested in
[There are several reasons why existential risk reduction is likely to
be underinvested in.]{.underline} [Firstly, it is a global public
good.]{.underline} [Economic theory predicts that such goods tend to be
underprovided.]{.underline} [The benefits of existential risk reduction
are widely and indivisibly dispersed around the globe from the countries
responsible for taking action.]{.underline} Consequently, a country
which reduces existential risk gains only a small portion of the
benefits but bears the full brunt of the costs. Countries thus have
strong incentives to free ride, receiving the benefits of risk reduction
without contributing. As a result, too few do what is in the common
interest. [Secondly]{.underline}, as already suggested above,
[existential risk reduction is an intergenerational public good: most of
the benefits are enjoyed by future generations who have no say in the
political process.]{.underline} [For these goods, the problem is
temporal free riding: the current generation enjoys the benefits of
inaction while future generations bear the costs. Thirdly]{.underline},
many [existential risks]{.underline}, such as machine superintelligence,
engineered pandemics, and solar geoengineering, [pose an unprecedented
and uncertain future threat.]{.underline} Consequently, it is hard to
develop a satisfactory governance regime for them: there are few
existing governance instruments which can be applied to these risks, and
it is unclear what shape new instruments should take. In this way, our
position with regard to these emerging risks is comparable to the one we
faced when nuclear weapons first became available. [Cognitive biases
also lead people to underestimate existential risks.]{.underline} [Since
there have not been any catastrophes of this magnitude, these risks are
not salient to politicians and the public.]{.underline}72 [This is an
example of the misapplication of the availability heuristic, a mental
shortcut which assumes that something is important only if it can be
readily recalled. Another cognitive bias affecting perceptions of
existential risk is scope neglect.]{.underline} In a seminal 1992 study,
three groups were asked how much they would be willing to pay to save
2,000, 20,000 or 200,000 birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The
groups answered \$80, \$78, and \$88, respectively.73 In this case, the
size of the benefits had little effect on the scale of the preferred
response. [People become numbed to the effect of saving lives when the
numbers get too large.]{.underline} 74 [Scope neglect is a particularly
acute problem for existential risk because the numbers at stake are so
large.]{.underline} [Due to scope neglect, decision-makers are prone to
treat existential risks in a similar way to problems which are less
severe by many orders of magnitude.]{.underline} A wide range of other
cognitive biases are likely to affect the evaluation of existential
risks.75

### Consequentialism Good

#### Refusing to assume responsibility for the consequences of their \[ontological/epistemological/whatever\] starting point enables political [disaster]{.underline}---their args about ontological entanglement with the rest of the world [prove this]{.underline}

**Zanotti 17**

Associate Professor Department of Political Science, Virginia Tech
(Laura, "Reorienting IR: Ontological Entanglement, Agency, and Ethics,"
International Studies Review, January 13, 2017

In this article, I have argued that in order for IR to remain
politically relevant and critical, we must rethink and reflect on the
ontological, epistemological, and methodological assumptions of the
discipline. I then explored how [onto-epistemologies, ethics, and
political agency are **interlinked**]{.underline}. Ontologies of
entanglement tend to embrace complex conceptualizations of causality and
the morphogenetic properties of what exist. In a quantum world,
ontological cuts happen in practices. [This]{.underline} worldview
[invites a **reconsideration** of the way we **justify**]{.underline}
and address [**political decisions** and **ethical action** beyond the
**universalism** supported by atomistic ontologies and the **stifling
limits** imposed by substantialist-structuralism]{.underline}. As Nick
Onuf has argued, "In a straightened world, as [in a world in turmoil,
talk of universal principles **rings hollow**]{.underline}... [In such a
world, positional ethics is the **best we can hope for**]{.underline}"
(Onuf forthcoming, quoted with permission). [A quantum
reconceptualization of our being in the world and our relation to matter
calls for a **profound sense of modesty**, as well as for the **central
role of responsibility** for taking political decisions. In an entangled
world that is **not governed** by **theoretically detectable**,
**linear**, and **immutable laws** of history, but instead by
**intra-agential processes**, the conditions of possibility for
political agency are rooted in]{.underline} the morphogenetic properties
of **[practices]{.underline}**. Taking responsibility for critically
questioning what exists without the hubris of assuming our ability to
ordain outcomes displays an affinity with Foucault's methodological and
political project. In this vein, [ethical guidelines **may not be
grounded on abstractions** stemming from the solitary ruminations of an
individual's mind]{.underline}. [Prudence, responsibility]{.underline},
and practices of cultivation of the self [offer pathways to **overcome
the limitations** of]{.underline} the Kantian categorical imperative by
which **[universal prescriptions]{.underline}** are the main way of
validating ethical choices. As Patomäki has shown, [universalism may
elicit **exclusionary** and **violent practices**]{.underline}.
Moreover, as Connolly has argued, [the nostalgia for a slowly moving
world regulated by **linear relations of causality** and characterized
by **certainty** and **stability** may be the **root of
fundamentalism**.]{.underline} Furthermore, [if we accept]{.underline}
Barad's position [that we are "**of the world**" and not **above the
world**, theorizing looks more like a practice endowed with
**performative political effects** than a **quest** for the discovery of
the "**true nature**" of what exists]{.underline}. Therefore,
[intellectual undertakings are a **form of political agency** and come
with **great responsibility**. Such responsibility **requires** the need
for **exercising prudence** in making truth statements about what is
**universally good** or **naturally inevitable**. Assumptions
about]{.underline} linearity of causal relations,
**[universal]{.underline}** laws of history, or **[ontological
properties]{.underline}** of entities [yield]{.underline} two
[**problematic effects**. On the one hand, they may **stifle political
imagination**; on the other hand, they could encourage actions based
upon **abstract prescriptions** rather than upon **careful diagnosis**
of the forces that obtain in the situation at hand. In an entangled
world, **there are no externalities**. Arguments that **divert
responsibility** by basing political choices upon **abstract
principles** or **aspirations** and]{.underline}, as a result, [that
treat **what happens on the ground** as "**unintended consequences**" or
"**collateral damage**," are **ethically thin** and **politically
dangerous**.]{.underline} In fact, [**unintended consequences** may well
be the result of **irresponsible political decision-making** that does
not include a **competent assessment** of the **practical
configurations** that constitute the **context of action** and the
**means necessary** to achieve stated goals. Such
attitudes]{.underline}, Amoureux and Steele (2014) have suggested, [have
led to **disastrous initiatives**, such as the **Bush administration's
invasion of Iraq**]{.underline}. Likewise, Kennedy (2006) has shown that
[the]{.underline} bland [rhetoric]{.underline} of jus in bello that
provides standardized criteria regarding the number of acceptable
civilian casualties (conveniently called collateral damage) [produces
the effect of **diverting responsibility** from those who conduct war
while **assuaging their consciences** concerning the injuries and deaths
their choices are inflicting]{.underline}. Kennedy (2004) has also shown
that [as a result of the preference for **universal normativity**,
the]{.underline} human rights [profession]{.underline} (which he calls
"the invisible college") [is more concerned with **protecting abstract
norms** than with **acting politically** so as to **devise viable
solutions** to **specific problems**.]{.underline} Universal norms and
bureaucratic routines play a major role in prescribing and justifying UN
peacekeeping interventions. As Jean Marie Guehénno argued more than a
decade ago, strategies of international intervention based upon
assumptions of causal linearity and invariance may amount to hubris.
Norms and rules can also offer grounds for appeasement. The massacres
that occurred in Rwanda and Srebrenica in the 1990s provide examples of
how, by uncritically following institutionalized rules, United Nations
peacekeepers permitted atrocities. UN employees are not cold-blooded
monsters or extremely callous individuals. They follow norms and rules,
key examples of which include the principle of "impartiality," Security
Council mandates, and "rules of engagement." By doing so, however, they
have often fallen short of considering the possible consequences of
decisions in specific situations. The United Nations' failure to take
action to prevent the Rwanda and Srebrenica genocide testifies to the
fact that following universal norms (i.e., the imperative to preserve
impartiality) and bureaucratic reasoning (i.e., the rules of engagement
prescribing not to intervene to disarm any party of the conflict) set
the stage for avoiding a careful assessment of what was at stake on the
eve of the massacres. These ways of reasoning also appeased consciences
for not making decisions accountable to the people in danger (Zanotti
2014). Significantly, [the **lack of prudence** that derives from
**broad overgeneralizations** and **reliance on abstractions**,
**rather** than **careful consideration** of **what the case demands**,
threatens **more self-defeating outcomes** in peacekeeping and
international politics. This is why a **careful reflection** of the ways
our political choices are **validated ontologically** and
**epistemologically** is of **paramount practical
importance**]{.underline}. Seven decades ago, Carr (1946) advocated the
need for conceptualizing political agency and ethics in a way that
addresses both the limits of the idealist illusion regarding the
possibility to transform reality through acts of will as well as the
realist persuasion about the inescapable subordination of actors to
external conditions. Both of [these positions]{.underline}, Carr pointed
out, [lead to **self-defeating outcomes** and **stifle political
imagination** because they **focus on general abstractions**,
**failing** to take into consideration what conditions and political
opportunity **actually obtain** in **specific historical
configurations**]{.underline}. Here I have proposed that [an ontology of
entanglement fosters an **ethic of engagement** and
**activism**]{.underline} along the lines suggested by Foucault and
opens up possibilities for political action. In this ontological
horizon, [what qualifies as meaningful agency is **not stifled**
by]{.underline} the structuralist commitment to the stabilizing effects
of structures (like in Waltz's) or by [the **inescapable features** of
an **oppressive** and **alienating social order** that **dispossess
subjects of their humanity** and **reduces them to "bare
life"**]{.underline} (as in Agamben). Instead, [micropolitical
interventions]{.underline}, parrēsia, and the cultivation of a
particular kind of character, [**while not revolutionizing the status
quo**, may be relevant to **triggering social change**]{.underline}.
Importantly, [ontologies of entanglement also **raise the bar** for
**adjudicating** the **ethical validity of political choices**. Radical
assumption of responsibility **drastically limits what is acceptable**
as "**unintended consequences**." This is **important** for]{.underline}
the way international organizations make decisions regarding
international peacekeeping interventions and for [**the way politicians
decide to wage war**. **Ethically** and **politically sound**
decision-making **cannot** be based mainly upon]{.underline} the
apodictic recognition of universal rules of behavior, [**abstract
aspirations**, or **overarching theories** of the functioning of
society. They must also include **careful analysis** of how]{.underline}
clusters of [causes may **generate effects** in the **specific
contexts** at hand and **take responsibility** for]{.underline} the
ontological cuts [our initiatives]{.underline} operate [and for
the]{.underline} morphogenetic [processes they may set off.]{.underline}

### NATO Good -- Gendermen

#### No link---NATO's WPS agenda has disrupted gender hierarchies

[And yet, engaging in gender work can offer opportunities for a more
'genderconscious' masculinity to develop]{.underline} (Hurley, 2018a).
In Chapter 1, we highlight how change in institutions of hegemonic
masculinity is, at least theoretically, possible[. In her discussion of
change in hegemonic masculinity, Duncanson (2013, 2015) highlights the
dangers of dismissing any form of positive change in the way men
construct, understand and enact their masculinities as simply the
'flexibility of the machinery of rule' (Duncanson, 2015: 232). Positive
change is not always co-option, and as Connell and Messerschmidt (2005:
840) argue, the concept of hegemonic masculinity was never meant to mean
a 'toxic assemblage' of negative traits: though, as we have discussed,
co-option and hybridisation can be ways in which particular forms of
masculinity retain their hegemonic status]{.underline} (Messner, 2007;
Demetriou, 2001). Duncanson argues that positive change and the
'unravelling of hegemonic masculinity' is possible and that it must
begin with men being encouraged: not so much to change their ways as to
change the way in which they negotiate their identities in relation to
others. [Rather than forge their identities through relations of
opposition or domination, men and subjects in general need to construct
their identities through recognition of similarity, respect,
interdependence, empathy and equality with others.]{.underline}
(Duncanson 2015: 233, emphasis in original) [There was evidence of this
(re)negotiation in the accounts of NATO's gendermen. Those with whom we
spoke to articulated a great deal of respect for their
colleagues]{.underline}. Witnessing the mutual admiration and respect
the men and women of the Executive Committee of the NCGP had for each
other whilst working together to advance gender issues within NATO was
further testament to this. [Yet, doing gender work and putting on your
gender glasses (a point returned to in Chapter 5) also afforded an
opportunity to increase mutual respect between men and women both inside
and outside of NATO:]{.underline} In the armed forces as well as in
civil society, it is not just a matter of having the same salaries,
having the same access to work; it is having the same mentality. Once
you get this mentality, especially in men, seeing life with your gender
glasses, I think the lives of many people will change ... you apply the
gender glasses to everything and your level of respect for the other
gender is much better. Interview with NATO Official, 2012 in Hurley
(2018) [In addition to the fostering of respect, there was also a sense
of empathy, both for women within NATO and those external to it, those
affected by war and conflict that was articulated:96 NATO women and
gendermen]{.underline} We try to find believers \[in gender\] and you
find believers everywhere, they don't need to be women, most of them are
women. I can tell you, unfortunately, because I feel really alone in
this world. I feel the same as when women joined the armed forces and
they were just one or two and it is really hard, I can tell you, it is
really hard. You have to behave because they are watching you ... they
are watching you, they are paying attention to what you do because you
are, let's say an alien in their world. You have to introduce this
issue, but in a serious way. You have to explain to them basic gender
concepts, very basic gender concepts, but you have to go deeper. It is
not just: 'What is gender mainstreaming?', 'What are gender
perspectives?' It is more. It applies to people suffering the effects of
wars and operations. You have to listen to them, understand how they
feel, how the operations affect them and in which ways; ask how you can
help them. Interview with NATO Official, 2012 in Hurley (2018) [As
highlighted above, gendermen are in a distinct position within NATO,
they find themselves in a minority position vis-à-vis women when working
on gender. Doing this work makes men highly visible and this brings with
it feelings of being out of place; this can prompt a form of empathy
with women who occupy a minority position vis-à-vis men within NATO writ
large (Hurley, 2018a).]{.underline}

[NATO's own external presentation of the work of its Gender Advisors is
largely extremely positive.52]{.underline} The most comprehensive
reviews of their work have been upbeat overall. Egnell, Hojem, and
Berts' presented Gender Advisors' as having 'made a gender perspective a
real and permanent feature of Swedish contributions to international
operations'53 We asked Gender Advisors what they felt had been their key
successes. Their responses are scrutinized in two directions: first,
internal: in terms of changing mindsets within their military structures
as regards women and the relevance of gender (an aspect of regendering,
discussed above) and changing their colleagues' working practices;
second, external: in terms of impacts upon communities -- improving
security for women and men, and increasing women's participation.
Changes in Military Practice and Mindsets [Overwhelmingly, Gender
Advisors tended to describe their success in terms of
'institutionalization' and 'integration' of procedures to include gender
perspectives. The Gender Advisors generally conveyed a sense of slow but
steady progress in acceptance of the relevance of gender to militaries,
and processes to facilitate consideration of it in military
operations]{.underline}. Lackenbauer and Langlais' 2013 review had found
that ISAF Gender Advisors had little structure for their work, having to
decide on their own focus and tasks. The more recently deployed Gender
Advisors we interviewed described established processes for Gender
Advisors' engagement in planning, identification of goals and
indicators; more access to command; and fuller staffing of Gender
Advisor posts. Those who been involved in the Resolute Support Mission
in Afghanistan, which commenced in January 2015, described gender as
integrated in the Mission's indicators and reporting mechanisms;
operational plans and standard operating procedures; facilities,
activities, budgets; and focusing not only upon women but upon
influencing men. [Some Gender Advisors describe a key mark of progress
as the recognition by the command that integrating gender perspective is
their responsibility, advised and supported by their Gender Advisor,
rather than the responsibility of the Gender Advisor]{.underline}. When
it started in 2008 ... they put a lot of responsibility on the Gender
Field Advisor. And then it was very easy to criticise the work because
it's very difficult to be successful if you're, like, alone and ... no
one really knows what is this about ... now the organisation has a full
understanding and acceptance of this, and that is that the work of
integrating a gender perspective should always be the Commander's ... So
absolutely, absolutely it has evolved. (Agnes) Another ISAF Gender
Advisor recounted being in a senior staff meeting in which the commander
asked who was going to a conference organized by Afghan women. When eyes
slid to the Gender Advisor, the commander said, 'I am on board. We will
push this button. And if I do it, you have to do it too' (meaning they
all had to go to the conference). Although describing gender as a
'button' raises questions, the Gender Advisor interpreted this as the
commander reiterating the importance for all parts of the Mission of
engaging with Afghan women. [As evidence of institutionalization through
the headquarters or operation, a number of Gender Advisors described
colleagues independently including gender in planning documents or
analyses]{.underline}. Many highlighted changing their colleagues'
mindset as regard the relevance of gender. Security and Women's
Empowerment [A number of Gender Advisors gave examples of how their
advice had been used to mitigate the harm that NATO's own activities
might pose to women. Some mentioned using a gender perspective in
analysing intelligence so as to mitigate 'collateral damage' in NATO
targeting]{.underline}. One described broadening consultation with local
communities to include women, so to understand what roads they used, to
be able to avoid them. One spoke of 'prevent\[ing\] an American General
killing some women' by advising on how funding might be provided to
community projects without inflaming local rivalries. [Gender Advisors,
however, most often described their successes as hoped-for impacts of
their individual contacts with local women: having facilitated their
coming together, inspiring them to join the security forces, motivating
them.]{.underline} The first thing I wrote was a zero ... \[but\] I met
Afghan women and would see them six months later with burkhas off,
talking to soldiers, trying to negotiate for funds ... maybe a little
drop that fills up the bucket, for me, that is enough. (Workshop
participant) I hope that I have motivated one woman to not give up and
keep fighting for women's rights. (Workshop participant) [A number of
Gender Advisors had worked to support Afghan security forces in
integrating women, and felt that their advocacy with the Afghan
authorities to emphasize the importance of women's participation had
been successful. One talked about directly supporting female police
through helping them to set up their own network; another about Gender
Advisors' support to centres and protection units dealing with gender
based violence. Others talked about being role models for Afghan women
to join the security forces]{.underline}. We noticed that, although the
description of a Gender Advisor's role in Bi-Strategic Directive 40-1
refers to gender analysis and collection of data, none identified
progress by reference to measured changes in, for example, prevalence of
acts of violence or community perceptions of security.54 [They did not
claim systematic positive impacts upon the lives of communities affected
by conflict or by NATO operations; rather small wins and hopeful
signals.]{.underline}

### NATO Good -- A2 Imperialism

#### NATO's engagement is not unidirectional imperialism, but a collaborative process with members and allies---UNSCR 1325 proves

UNSCR 1325 has proven a useful diplomatic tool for NATO's EAPC partners
to further their engagement and influence at NATO, incommensurate with
status. [The role of partner states in NATO's adoption of UNSCR 1325 has
challenged assumptions that NATO partnerships are (solely) a means
through which NATO can influence the aspirations of non-members by
setting the parameters of the relationship. This challenges assumptions
that NATO partnerships are (solely) outward-facing and that NATO sets
the parameters of the relationship]{.underline} (Holmberg, 2011: 534;
Webber, Hallams and Smith, 2014: 776; Simón, 2014: 18; Wallander, 2000:
729). For example, the NATO/EAPC Policy calls for NATO partners to be
involved in the development of the Military Concept (what would become
Bi-Strategic Command Directive 40--1), 'to the maximum possible extent'
given 'their important contributions of Partner nations to NATO-led
operations' (NATO, 2007). [This has demonstrated that norm sharing can
be a multi-directional process with NATO partners having had a
significant role in putting UNSCR 1325 onto NATO's agenda and in
continuing to support it. This challenges understandings of NATO
partnerships as unidirectional, both as a means through which NATO can
influence the aspirations of non-members by setting the parameters of
the relationship]{.underline} (Wallander, 2000: 729) and as a
'functional tool for burden sharing' (Hallams, 2013: 119). This is
significant given the widening and broadening of NATO partnerships,
including into Asia and the Middle East, necessitates a reassessment of
the value of partnerships (for NATO and partners), even if NATO has yet
to fully resolve the purpose of partnerships (Moore, 2012: 57). As this
chapter goes onto discuss, the broadening of the actors involved within
NATO's engagement with WPS has strengthened both the latest iterations
of the NATO/EAPC Policy on UNSCR 1325 applicable to the civilian
structure and the accompanying military Bi-Strategic Command Directive
40--1. The actors involved include, but are not limited to, NATO
Officials, member states, partner states, civil society, NATO Special
Representative on WPS, IMS Office of the Gender Advisor, NATO Committee
on Gender Perspectives and most recently Angelina Jolie. [The alliance's
engagement with WPS has created new gender policy machinery in the form
of the NATO Special Representative and the recreation of the IMS Office
of the Gender Advisor and NCGP]{.underline}. It has also garnered
attention from external actors who were not present and did not
contribute to NATO's initial engagement with WPS (civil society,
Angelina Jolie). So, while the role of NATO partners, namely Austria and
Sweden, and the Friends of 1325, was crucial in putting WPS onto NATO's
agenda, we need to consider if these new actors have influenced the
ideas and practices underpinning WPS at NATO.

### Liberalism Good

#### The perm is best \-\-- the alt fails alone but combining strategies provides meaningful routes for change

**[If there is no realistic or preferable alternative to broadly liberal
approaches, what can be done in the face of the current "crisis" of
liberal peacebuilding]{.underline}**? The first step is to question the
extent to which this crisis is real or imagined. In this article, I have
attempted to show that some of the most sweeping [critiques of liberal
peacebuilding have rested on dubious claims and logic]{.underline},
[including the conflation of post-conquest and post-settlement
peacebuilding; unnuanced analogies of peacebuilding and colonialism or
imperialism; definitions of the liberal peace that are too broad;
mischaracterizations of the peacebuilding record; and
oversimplifications of the moral complexity of
peacebuilding]{.underline}. Considered in this light, [**the purported
crisis of liberal peacebuilding appears to be less severe and less
fundamental than some have claimed.** The challenge today is not to
replace or move "beyond" liberal peacebuilding, but to reform existing
approaches within a broadly liberal framework]{.underline}. **[This
enterprise has both conceptual and policy elements]{.underline}**.
**[Peacebuilding remains ripe for theoretical treatments that shed light
on the meaning and effects of these operations]{.underline}**. In other
words, [the peacebuilding literature need not, and should not, be
limited to narrowly policy-oriented]{.underline} or "problem solving"
[analyses]{.underline}. In the 1990s, most of the peacebuilding
literature was preoccupied with practical policy issues and paid little
attention to the relationships between peacebuilding and larger
phenomena in international politics. The rise of more [critical
analysis]{.underline} since then has been part of a welcome broadening
of the field, which now [places greater emphasis on exploring the
theoretical underpinnings and implications of these
missions]{.underline}. The great strength of critical approaches has
always been their focus on exposing and dissecting widely held
assumptions and orthodoxies. But **[critical scholarship can lose its
intellectual and empirical moorings if it fails to be self-reflective
and self-critical --]{.underline}** that is, [if its logic, evidence and
implications are not themselves subject to scrutiny and
challenge]{.underline}. **[Nothing in the recent critical literature
offers a convincing rationale for abandoning liberal peacebuilding,
rather than reforming it]{.underline}**. If anything, the rise of what I
have called [hyper-critical scholarship]{.underline} -- and particularly
its dubious yet seemingly ritualized rejection of liberal peacebuilding
-- [has served to cloud rather than clarify our understanding of what
peacebuilding is, and what it does.]{.underline} 38 Of course, there is
no single "best" way of analyzing these missions or the broader
phenomenon of international peacebuilding. [This field of research is --
and hopefully will remain -- a diverse bazaar of different theoretical
and empirical approaches, open to discussion and debate across
intellectual traditions and methodologies]{.underline}. This article has
sought to contribute to this debate by arguing for a rethinking and
rebalancing of liberal peacebuilding critiques. In contrast to the
unconvincing hyper-criticism of today, or the irrational exuberance of
earlier [years, a more constructively critical approach might build on
the recognition that: (1) both liberalism and liberal peacebuilding are
deeply problematic concepts]{.underline} -- in theory and application --
[and their internal contradictions play themselves out in peacebuilding,
sometimes in troubling and destructive ways; (2) liberally-oriented
peacebuilding can,]{.underline} in principle, [accommodate]{.underline}
a great deal of internal [variation and adjustment,
**including**]{.underline} many of **[the specific changes proposed
by]{.underline}** many [**critics**; (3) scholars who]{.underline}
repudiate liberal peacebuilding or [call for "alternative" strategies
should be **expected to reflect carefully on the normative
underpinnings** of their own arguments, and to **clarify the
alternatives they may be proposing**, including the moral and practical
implications of pursuing these alternatives]{.underline}. The third
point should be particularly important for those who believe that
critical peacebuilding scholarship has an important contribution to make
to the field -- and that the recent turn towards a reflexive
anti-liberalism has diminished the force of these critiques. **[Adopting
a constructively critical orientation does not mean accepting the
current practices of peacebuilding.]{.underline}** **[It does not mean
that peacebuilding must be "top-down" instead of
"bottom-up"]{.underline}** -- that is a criticism of centralism, not
liberalism. **[It does not mean that peacebuilding should be fixated on
formal institutions to the exclusion of informal or customary methods of
governance]{.underline}** -- that is a criticism of formalism, not
liberalism. It [does not mean that peacebuilders should adopt a "fixed,
non-negotiable concept of what the state should eventually
look]{.underline} [like]{.underline}"117 -- that is a criticism of
institutional isomorphism, not liberalism. [Nor does it mean that
peacebuilders should assume that liberalization will necessarily foster
peace]{.underline} -- that is a criticism of naïve Wilsonianism, one
variant of liberalism.118 **[Addressing all of these real problems may
entail probing the internal tensions of liberalism, but it does not
require a sweeping rejection of liberal peacebuilding.]{.underline}** In
fact, [there are many recent examples of constructively critical
research that raise important theoretical and practical questions, some
of which challenge liberal premises without making the mistake of
discarding the baby with the bathwater]{.underline}. [For
instance:]{.underline} [What are the sources and dynamics of
"legitimacy" in international peacebuilding]{.underline}?119 What
obligations, if any, do international actors have in rebuilding
societies after conflict?120 What are the limits of external democracy
promotion efforts?121 [How might "non-elite" populations of host states
be included more directly into peace negotiations and post-conflict
institutional reform]{.underline}?122 What is the relationship between
power-sharing arrangements and peace?123 [How might ideas of "local
ownership" be developed in a manner that avoids simplistic bromides
about the need for greater local ownership or
emancipation?]{.underline}124 Other examples include: [How do
"discursive frames" and organizational procedures shape the design and
conduct of peacebuilding in practice]{.underline}?125 How can
peacebuilding agencies learn from experiences across missions without
falling into the trap of assuming that "technical" knowledge is readily
transferrable across diverse local circumstances?126 Why does the UN
seem to make peacebuilding commitments that it subsequently fails to
fulfill in practice?127 [What are the economic impacts of
peacebuilding]{.underline} operations?128 What is the relationship
between "peace conditionalities" in economic assistance and the
durability of the ensuing peace?129 How can economic liberalization be
pursued in ways that minimize the dangers of strengthening black
markets?130 Under what circumstances should peacebuilding missions end,
and how should they "exit"?131 This is just a small sampling of research
questions that represent a broad mix of normative approaches. They point
to even larger unresolved questions, including the crucial issue of how
one should define peacebuilding "success."132 Many of these research
efforts also offer the possibility of making peacebuilding operations
more effective, and more just, in the future. Whichever research paths
one may chose to follow, those engaged in constructively critical
analysis have an immense task ahead of them: peacebuilding is
tremendously complex and prone to unanticipated consequences, yet it is
also too important to lose or abandon. [As long as both scholars and
practitioners embrace an open, critical discussion]{.underline} of
peacebuilding's merits and flaws, [without descending into unwarranted
hyper-criticism]{.underline}, [there is still hope of
improving]{.underline} both the conception and delivery of
[international]{.underline} assistance to [societies]{.underline}
embarking on difficult transitions from war to peace.

#### Liberalism is inevitable and a transition would cause escalating conflict -- the alt excludes the aff but the aff doesn't exclude the alt 

**Paris, 10** -- (Roland, Associate Professor, Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs, University of Ottawa, "Saving Liberal
Peacebuilding," February 17, 2010,

// kt \*\*modified for ableist language

In fact, **[there seems to be no viable alternative to some version of
liberal peacebuilding.]{.underline}** Consider, [first, the question of
whether international peacebuilding should be continued at
all.]{.underline} As we saw, some commentators including Jeffrey Herbst
and Jeremy Weinstein have suggested that conflicts should sometimes be
allowed to burn themselves out, and that large-scale "impartial"
intervention (even after a ceasefire agreement) risks locking in
conditions that are not sustainable or compatible with long-term peace.
There is some logic to this approach, since wars ending in military
victory may produce longer-lasting peace than those ending in negotiated
settlements. But [this strategy could also involve huge risks and costs:
The victors might decimate the losers, or alternatively some wars might
grind on for years or decades without resolution, all the while
producing humanitarian crises before one side finally achieves
victory.]{.underline} In the meantime, [conflicts could spread to
neighbouring territories]{.underline}, as several have done in Africa in
recent years. On balance, then, **[failing to provide assistance when it
is possible to do so, and when it is requested by local parties, would
seem a short-sighted and dangerous solution to the shortcomings of these
operations;]{.underline}** **[just as suspending the practice of
post-conflict peacebuilding would be a significant overreaction to the
various problems that these missions have experienced and
caused.]{.underline}** Nor is there any sign of declining demand for new
operations, given the increased trend for civil conflicts to end in
negotiated settlements in recent years.97 But [why, in this case, must
peacebuilding be liberal]{.underline}? **[The simple answer is that
alternative strategies -- that is, strategies not rooted in liberal
principles -- would likely create more problems than they would
solve]{.underline}**. One approach, for example, might be for
international agencies to establish permanent trusteeships over war-torn
states -- that is, externally run governments that have no intention of
ceding their authority to local actors. This option is not unlike the
formula proposed by Stephen Krasner, who called for direct international
governance of dangerously fragile states "for an indefinite period of
time."98 The main problem with this approach is that it would come very
close to colonial-type control -- indeed, much more so than even the
most longlasting and interventionist post-settlement missions that have
been conducted to date. Maintaining such an arrangement over the long
term would likely require permanent suppression of domestic political
activity within the host state. As David Edelstein points out, even when
foreign military deployments are made at the invitation of local
parties, they face a problem of an "obsolescing welcome" whereby
elements of the local population tend to grow increasingly resentful of
a powerful external presence in their society.99 Continuing to embrace
the objective of transferring full sovereign powers to local actors may
thus be the single most important strategy for addressing this problem
and for widening the "window" of time available for peacebuilders to
assist in strengthening domestic institutions within the host state. By
contrast, establishing permanent foreign rule would reduce the time
available for peacebuilders to do their work before local resentment
begins to build and the peacebuilding mission becomes an obstacle to,
rather than a facilitator of, consolidating a stable peace. A second
alternative to liberal peacebuilding might be for international agencies
to identify local leaders who could rule as undemocratic strongmen over
their society. This would, at least, provide a means for peacebuilders
to scale back their presence quickly, as long as they continued to offer
various types of support (financial, material, etc.) to the ruling
person or party. Indeed, this was roughly that strategy that the United
States and Soviet Union pursued with their respective patrons in many
parts of the world during the Cold War. However, one of the practical
problems with this approach is that authoritarian regimes created and
sustained by external parties have often turned out to be more fragile
than they appear, in part because they tend to lack domestic legitimacy
and therefore remain in power only by repressing or buying off their
internal rivals. This was one of the lessons learned at the end of the
Cold War, when a reduction or cessation of immense flows of superpower
assistance led to the collapse of authoritarian regimes in Somalia,
Zaire/Congo and elsewhere, followed by a violent scramble for power.
Furthermore, in a country just emerging from civil war, where two or
more factions were engaged in large-scale killing, a postconflict
"strongman strategy" would risk alienating unrepresented groups that
might choose to resume violence rather than living under the new regime.
Some measure of power-sharing, or at least a reasonable prospect of
gaining power through an unrigged political process, generally helps to
mitigate this danger.100 A third **[alternative to liberal peacebuilding
might be to rely on traditional or indigenous practices of peace-making
and governance, rather than elections and other accoutrements of liberal
democracy.]{.underline}** Roger Mac Guinty has usefully highlighted the
limited space provided for such approaches in existing peacebuilding
models, which tend to be "highly standardized" and rooted in a sense of
the "superiority of Western approaches to peace-making."101 In contrast
to the more formalistic and legalistic approaches, traditional and
indigenous methods tend to focus on "consensus decision-making, a
restoration of the human/resource balance, and compensation or gift
exchange designed to ensure reciprocal and ongoing harmonious relations
between groups."102 Because they reflect local customs, he adds, these
techniques may "hold the potential to achieve a grass-roots legitimacy
that may be lacking from more technocratic 'alien' forms of dispute
resolution that form the mainstay of Western-funded and designed
peacesupport programs and projects."103 [While]{.underline} [Mac Guinty
makes a strong case for adapting policies to local conditions and
traditions]{.underline} (using examples such as Afghanistan's Loya
Jirgas, or tribal [assemblies, which played an important role in that
country's initial transition from Taliban rule), he does not recommend
relying exclusively on such techniques]{.underline}. On the contrary, he
wisely warns of **[the danger of romanticizing traditional or indigenous
practices]{.underline}** -- not least **[because they may serve to
reinforce "the authority of existing power-holders" and to impose
"social conformity," sometimes in brutal ways]{.underline}**.104 Tanja
[Chopra's analysis of local peacebuilding initiatives in Kenya offers
cautionary tale illustrating these dangers]{.underline}. Efforts to tap
into traditional conflict-resolution techniques through community-level
"peace committees" in Keyna have shown some success, but in some cases
they have also served to "deepen existing rifts between communities" and
"reinforce divisions" while also undermining concurrent efforts to
strengthen respect for the rule of law at the national level.105
**[Traditional and bottom-up approaches,]{.underline}** in other
words**[, should be part of peacebuilding, but they are no
panacea.]{.underline}** There are other reasons to be cautious before
embracing traditional governance methods. Those who believe that doing
so will eliminate or reduce the intrusion of foreign peacebuilders in
the domestic affairs of the host state fail to recognize that
peacebuilders will still need to make crucial choices, whether they wish
to do so or not. [**No society has a single, unambiguous set of
governance structures (traditional or otherwise) that can be
automatically activated.** Consequential decisions must therefore be
made to privilege some structures and not others -- and, as much as
peacebuilders might view themselves as referees in such decisions, in
fact they will always be "players" simply by virtue of their relative
power in the domestic setting of a wartorn state]{.underline}.106 In any
event, **[some measure of external influence may be necessary and
desirable:]{.underline}** if the post-conflict society could organize
its own governance arrangements without international assistance, there
would have been no need or demand for peacebuilding in the first place.
Given all this, consider the implications [if international agencies
were to adopt a general policy of relying on indigenous governance
structures in post-conflict countries]{.underline}. Very likely, [any
political outcomes]{.underline} of this process [would be questioned and
contested due to perceived international "interference,"]{.underline}
[no matter how well-meaning and diligent the peacebuilders were in
seeking to remain neutral]{.underline}. Further, in cases where one
individual or group dominated such a process, the result could be the
equivalent of the second alternative to liberal peacebuilding discussed
above -- strongman rule -- with all the problems associated with that
option. These are all real concerns that counsel caution, but in spite
of the risks and complexities, experience in Afghanistan, Cambodia and
elsewhere suggests that much more research attention needs to be devoted
to the topic of hybrid arrangements in countries recovering from
conflict, or approaches those that blend formal, informal, modern and
customary methods of governance and conflict resolution.107 It is also
interesting that Mac Guinty argues that one of the benefits of customary
arrangements could be to enhance "political participation," while he
also warns against the dangers of authoritarianism. Such arguments
suggest that Mac Guinty, like other commentators discussed above, is
less concerned with the liberal orientation of current peacebuilding
approaches than he is with their relative rigidity and lack of
adaptability to local conditions. In fact, [**there is nothing in the
idea of the "liberal peace" or "liberal peacebuilding" that mandates
such inflexibility.** Liberal polities come in many different styles and
forms, from group-based "consociational" proportional representation
arrangements to Anglo-American-style plurality systems, and there is
nothing to prevent liberalism from accommodating new models**. Nor does
support for liberal political principles stand in the way of pursuing
any number of complementary initiatives and goals**]{.underline},
[including those focusing on]{.underline} post-conflict
[reconciliation]{.underline},108 [social welfare and
justice]{.underline},109 [extensive public deliberations]{.underline} at
the national and local levels,110 [or the empowerment and inclusion of
women and other marginalized groups]{.underline}.111 The **[key
principles of liberalism -- individual freedoms, representative
government, and constitutional limits on arbitrary power -- offer a
broader canvas for institutional design and creative policymaking.
Without clear alternatives, some version of liberalism therefore remains
the most sensible foundation for post-conflict
peacebuilding]{.underline}**. [The overarching goal of such missions
should be to create the conditions for representative self-government,
not only because such an outcome is the least morally objectionable goal
for peacebuilding, but also for the practical purpose of facilitating
the eventual departure of peacebuilders through the restoration of
domestic sovereignty over the territory.]{.underline} Further, while the
importance of [elections]{.underline} alone should not be exaggerated,
they [remain a crucial tool for populations to constitute their own
governments, not only during the period of peacebuilding, but on an
ongoing basis]{.underline}.112 While it is true that encouraging
elections itself involves an external intrusion in the internal affairs
of the host state, surely we can differentiate between more and less
acceptable intrusions -- including the fact that [elections are meant to
facilitate the society's ability to shape its own destiny and exercise
self-government,]{.underline} so that the peacebuilders themselves can
leave. Elections alone cannot achieve this goal, nor do elections equal
democracy. But of all the possible ways in which international actors
can influence the domestic politics of a country, the idea of promoting
self-government is one of the least morally objectionable -- and, from
the standpoint of not overstaying an "obsolescing welcome," it may be a
pragmatic necessity. Similarly, [while certain economic liberalization
strategies can be destabilizing]{.underline},113 [is there really an
alternative to some version of market-oriented reform]{.underline} in
states emerging from war? The second half of the twentieth century
demonstrated that centrally planned and state-dominated development
strategies -- including not only Soviet-style communism but also import
substitution strategies pursued in many parts of Latin America and
Africa -- generally produced lower levels of economic growth than
market-oriented development strategies. Debates continue about the
appropriate balance between the market and the state in economic
development, including greater regulation of financial institutions and
the like, but there is near-universal agreement today that
non-market-oriented economic policies (or those that do not give the
market a primary role in allocating scarce resources) are too
inefficient to generate sustained economic growth. Most of those who
have criticized the economic dimensions of liberal peacebuilding
(including this author) have called for less aggressive adjustment
strategies in order to reduce the destabilizing effects of rapid
marketization, but have not rejected the idea of economic liberalization
itself -- in part because economic growth is important to the long-term
success of peacebuilding.114 **[Although there is no guarantee that
states pursuing market-oriented development policies will become richer,
there is a near guarantee that those pursuing nonmarket-oriented
strategies will stay poor.]{.underline}** There is no
universally-applicable, market-oriented model appropriate for all
peacebuilding cases. Rather, [there are countless variations of liberal
economic policies that can be explored and pursued]{.underline},115 [but
all share]{.underline} one thing in common: [a primary orientation
toward markets as a foundation for long-term growth.]{.underline} If
existing economic policies have been ill-suited to the needs of war-torn
states, it is not because these policies have been "liberal" or
market-oriented in the broad sense of these terms, but rather, because
they have paid too little attention to the particular vulnerabilities of
countries just emerging from destructive and divisive conflicts,
including the potentially destabilizing effects of "shock therapy"
adjustment policies.116 Addressing such problems primarily involves
altering and customizing, not abandoning, the economically liberal
elements of peacebuilding.

### Policy Good

Bi-Strategic Command Directive 40--1 (Bi-SCD 40--1) represents NATO's
military structure's engagement with WPS. Here we consider Bi-SCD 40--1
as an integral part of NATO's gender architecture and a key moment in
NATO's initial engagement with UNSCR 1325 and later WPS. It was adopted
in 2009 and has since been revised twice, in 2012 and most recently in
20175 (NATO, 2009, 2012a). [The latest version represents a significant
development in the sophistication of NATO's understanding of WPS and
gender perspectives, it also outlines a clear line of accountability. In
a move away from previous versions, the Commander is clearly identified
as the responsible person for its implementation, with gender advisors
providing support and advice and gender focal points acting as a
facilitators (NATO, 2017b). As Chapter 5 will go onto argue, examining
these policies demonstrates both the changes in NATO's understanding of
the value of a gender perspective, but also the
continuities]{.underline}. Here, we provide an important context for
this discussion and consider the institutional actors responsible for
shaping it. Following the call in the 2007 NATO/EAPC Policy for NATO's
Military Authorities to lead on its implementation, Bi-SCD 40--1 was
adopted in 2009. As we go on to highlight in Chapter 5, the NATO
Strategic Commands -- Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the
Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT) -- jointly drafted
Bi-Strategic Command 40--1 'Integrating UNSCR 1325 and Gender
Perspective into the NATO Command Structure', with the aim of providing
'guidance for the integration of Resolutions, Conventions, Protocols and
gender perspective into the planning and conduct of NATO-led operations'
(Colao, 2013: 19). The document is binding on all International Military
Headquarters and any entity under the ACO or ACT chain of command, which
includes partner states. This represents another way in which NATO acts
as a 'teaching machine' (Enloe, 1981; Wright, 2016), with both member
and partner states deployed on NATO operations learning the value
Bi-Strategic Command 40--1 ascribes to the WPS agenda. [Bi-SCD 40--1 is
not military doctrine (doctrines are approved by the nations in the
Military Committee), but rather the core document for implementing a
gender perspective in NATO military operations. Bi-SCD 40--1 integrates
UNSCR 1325 and Related Resolutions as well as a gender perspective in
the NATO Command Structure, including measures for protection during
armed conflict.]{.underline} It is founded upon the three UNSCR 1325
'P's': prevent disproportionate impact on women and children in armed
conflict; protect women and children; and foster the participation of
women in all aspects of operations and levels of command. [The directive
introduces standards of behaviour and concepts inherent in EU and UN
policy]{.underline} (e.g. gender advisors, incorporating gender
perspectives in operational planning development). [The integration of
gender into Allied Joint Doctrine is now the responsibility of the
Gender Advisors at ACO and ACT (NATO ACT, 2015). Bi-SCD 40--1
contributes to standardising operations and establishing common ways of
accomplishing military tasks between different military actors under the
Allied Joint Doctrine version 1 in respect to gender perspectives and
WPS (NATO, 2017a).]{.underline} We return to Bi-SCD in Chapter 5 where
we consider what a 'gender perspective' means for NATO. Institutional
actors: supporting WPS at NATO In 2009, the Committee on Women in NATO
Forces was renamed the NATO Committee on Gender Perspectives (NCGP) and
its remit expanded to provide advice on gender issues, including the
implementation of UNSCRs 1325 and 1820 and future related UNSCRs under
the remit of WPS. We discuss the role of the NCGP in further detail in
the following chapters, including its important role in supporting
NATO's engagement with WPS. Here, our focus turns to the other
institutional actors who have supported UNSCR 1325 at NATO, particularly
in NATO's political structure. This provides important context for
understanding how the NCGP has supported WPS and how NATO's engagement
with gender issues transgresses across the military and political
structures. In 2013, UN Women commissioned a Global Review of 1325 to
mark the 15th anniversary of since the adoption of UNSCR 1325 in 2015.
In the subsequent report, NATO's Secretary General's Special
Representative on WPS was identified as an example of good practice for
the implementation of the agenda because the position was high profile
and reports directly to the Secretary General (Coomaraswamy, 2015). The
Special Representative has since been invited to address the UN Security
Council, and regularly meets with counterparts in the EU, OSCE and AU
and works with civil society on the issues. The position has been held
by two career diplomats Mari Skåre (2012--14) and Marriët Schuurman
(2014--17) and in 2018, Clare Hutchinson, a highly experienced and
accomplished gender advisor, took over the role. The creation of the
role has provided an important cornerstone of NATO's engagement with
WPS, yet it was not a foregone conclusion that it would be created and
considering how NATO came to have such a position is important for
understanding how NATO functions as a gendered institution. The creation
of the post of NATO Secretary General's Special Representative for WPS
was approved at NATO's 2012 Chicago Summit (WIIS, 2012) and marked a
watershed moment in the implementation of UNSCR 1325 at NATO. The move
to appoint an individual to support NATO's implementation of UNSCR 1325
stemmed from the 2007 NATO/EAPC Policy, which called for consideration
to be given to the appointment of a gender advisor at NATO HQ (NATO,
2007). [However, a Special Representative was a far more senior role,
whose position has the potential to support the advancement of the WPS
agenda at NATO. In considering the significance of the appointment of a
Special Representative on WPS it is important to distinguish such a role
from that of a gender advisor. A gender advisor acts as a means through
which to incorporate a gender perspective and in this sense can come to
represent an institution's gender expertise]{.underline}. In operational
situations and organisational departments, a gender advisor can provide
a useful means for incorporating a gender perspective, in particular
where specialised knowledge is required. Nevertheless, at a wider
organisational level, a gender advisor would symbolise an institution's
gender expertise and this would be likely to hinder attempts to
mainstream a gender perspective throughout the organisational structure,
particularly where they lack the seniority to report directly to the top
of the organisational command. For example, the appointment of a gender
advisor within the EU External Action Service has been criticised
because the position does not report directly to the High-Representative
and as such lacks sufficient authority (Guerrina and Wright, 2016). [A
high-level Special Representative on the other hand provides
institutional leadership and is able to hold the organisation account
for the implementation of WPS. This is why NATO's creation of the post
of Secretary General's Special Representative on WPS has been recognised
as an example of best practice for regional organisations.]{.underline}
The Global Review of UNSCR 1325 recommended that regional organisations
follow NATO's best practice and appoint high-level WPS representatives
in order to drive the implementation of the agenda (Coomaraswamy, 2015:
409).

### Reforms Good

#### Legal reforms challenge essentialist notions of gender

**Williams, 13** (Dr. Juliet A., associate professor in the Department
of Gender Studies at UCLA, \"Girls can be anything\...but boys will be
boys: discourses of sex difference in education reform debates,\" Nevada
Law Journal, Vol. 13, 5-17-13,
scholars.law.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1472&context=nlj)

\*In this context the "gender essentialists" that Williams is talking
about are those who think that masculine behavior is innately tied to
their biological sex. Meaning that she is arguing we need to challenge
notions that boys are and will always be aggressive, etc. She is also
talking about sex stereotyping in the context of promoting single gender
education environments\*

**[Law has an important role to play]{.underline}** in opening up space
[to contest gender essentialism]{.underline}. One way [this may
happen]{.underline} is [through rigorous application of]{.underline} the
still-evolving [anti-stereotyping]{.underline} principle in
constitutional equal protection analysis. The determination of whether a
classification constitutes stereotyping generally has been understood to
pivot on the question of whether an overbroad generalization is at play.
As a result, the judicial account of sex difference has been
characterized as a form of "sexual realism."67 As Katherine Franke
argues, in constitutional jurisprudence, "the wrong of sex
discrimination is premised upon a right of sexual differentiation, that
is, a fundamental belief in the truth of biological sexual
difference."68 From this perspective, ["\[d\]iscrimination occurs when
false or stereotypical differences are mistaken for real
differences]{.underline}."69 More recently, however, legal scholar Cary
Franklin has demonstrated that the anti-stereotyping principle is being
applied even in cases in which a biological sex difference is
recognized. 70 Reflecting on the significance of the 1996 decision U.S.
v. Virginia, in which the Supreme Court [found the male-only admission
policy at a state-supported military college
unconstitutional]{.underline}, Franklin finds growing judicial [support
for the view that "equal protection law should be particularly alert to
the possibility of sex stereotyping in contexts where 'real' differences
are involved, because these are the contexts in which sex
classifications have most often been used to perpetuate sex-based
inequality."71 In other words, the anti-stereotyping principle is now
invoked to engage the question of the social meaning attributed to sex
differences by a classification.]{.underline} In so doing,
[anti-stereotyping analysis thrusts the social construction of
masculinity to the fore, a development that creates critical leverage
for future challenges to essentialist pedagogies in court.]{.underline}
The evidence rallied to support sex segregation must be carefully
reviewed to ensure that sex stereotyping does not take the place of
meaningful education reforms.72 Responding to legal challenges,
proponents of "gender-friendly" educational initiatives portray their
detractors as feminist ideologues unwilling to accept the simple facts
of nature. But rhetorical warfare is no substitute for a fair and
impartial review of existing evidence. Indeed, [an
important]{.underline} [legacy of feminist legal reforms]{.underline} of
the past several decades [has been a progressive]{.underline}
[strengthening of the anti-stereotyping principle in sex-discrimination
law]{.underline}.73 The [vigorous application]{.underline} of a robust
anti-stereotyping principle [in law has played a]{.underline} [critical
role in defeating essentialist]{.underline} [justifications for policies
that promote the subordination of girls and women]{.underline}.74 But
[in the case of boys]{.underline} and men, **[essentialist discourses
are proving more resilient]{.underline}**. No doubt [law]{.underline}
once again [**has a central role to play** in challenging essentialist
policies]{.underline} [that insist we accommodate rather]{.underline}
[than interrogate the basis for masculine]{.underline}
[behavior]{.underline}. VI. GIRLS CAN BE ANYTHING . . . BUT BOYS WILL BE
BOYS After two decades of concerted gender advocacy in the United
States, girls' advocates and boys' advocates are sharply divided when it
comes to questions of gender difference. Building on [legal]{.underline}
[reforms]{.underline} of the 1970s that [were designed]{.underline} [to
curtail sex discrimination]{.underline} [and gender bias in the
classroom]{.underline}, [advocates]{.underline} for girls traditionally
[have emphasized]{.underline} [the need to challenge social
attitudes]{.underline} and practices that stand in the way of girls'
success. Where at one time the dominant social view of girls emphasized
inherent limitations, [there is now a flourishing]{.underline}
[discourse of possibility and "the sky's the limit" thinking about
girls]{.underline}.75 [The same cannot be said in the case of gender
advocacy for boys]{.underline}, where essentialist claims have risen to
the forefront. Indeed, [among boys' advocates]{.underline}, [there is a
growing]{.underline} [demand]{.underline} [to **adjust educational
environments and expectations to accommodate boys' innate capacities and
interests.** What emerges]{.underline}, then, [is a]{.underline}
[divergent discourse]{.underline} about kids, one [which]{.underline}
[simultaneously]{.underline} [proclaims]{.underline} that [girls can do
anything **but boys will be boys**]{.underline}.76 In this way,
contemporary gender discourse in education suggests a striking shift in
what anthropologist Sherry Ortner has called the "underlying logic of
cultural thinking" about sex and gender.77 In a now classic essay, Is
Female to Male as Nature is to Culture?, Ortner declared "the secondary
status of woman" to be "one of the true universals" of human
societies.78 Ortner attributes this "stubborn" fact to the universal
association of woman with nature and man with culture, an attribution
derived from "woman's greater bodily involvement" with reproduction.79
But the message emerging from boys' advocates today suggests a
significant reversal in the familiar terms of gender discourse. In
contemporary education reform debates, it is in [discussions of
girls]{.underline} that we most often [encounter]{.underline} [a
transcendent rhetoric of possibility.]{.underline} [In
contrast]{.underline}, [we are]{.underline} much more likely to be
[warned of the damaging]{.underline} [effects]{.underline} [of pushing
boys beyond biologically-determined cognitive and emotional
limits.]{.underline} One should not presume, however, that this shift
indicates a reversal in the gender hierarchy, for [the]{.underline}
[appropriation of an essentialist discourse]{.underline} [by boys'
advocates]{.underline} may in fact **[serve to reinforce male
privilege.]{.underline}** Today, [appeals]{.underline} to nature
[function]{.underline} [as an implicit rejoinder]{.underline} to the
suggestion [that boys' troubles]{.underline} [emanate]{.underline} in
practices [of gender socialization that reward aggression and
discourage]{.underline} the expression of emotional
[vulnerability]{.underline} in boys and men. Indeed, in the
education-reform debates, [the]{.underline} [assertion of boys'
fixed]{.underline} [and immutable nature]{.underline} **[has emerged as
a powerful tool to subvert interrogation of masculinity]{.underline}**.
From this perspective, among [the most]{.underline}
[important]{.underline} items of [unfinished business]{.underline} for
feminism today **[is a more serious reckoning with the effects of
essentialized masculinity]{.underline}**.80

### A2 No Policy W/O Activism

#### NATO's adoption of WPS was independent of activists---top-down politics solve

The eight WPS resolutions, which make-up the WPS agenda, each have their
own strengths and weaknesses, but it is clear that the greater
engagement there was with the NGO Working Group, the better the outcomes
in terms of aligning with feminist goals. [The continued feminist
engagement with the resolutions is evidenced in the strengthening of the
feminist content in the WPS resolutions. The adoption of the WPS
resolutions has had a number of positive effects, including challenging
the Security Council's conservative approach to gender (Otto, 2010: 98).
The WPS agenda embodied in the resolutions has created a 'snowball
effect' on institutional activity backed by the power of the Security
Council]{.underline} (Otto, 2010: 103). Many parts of the UN structure
have become involved in the implementation of the WPS agenda, for
example, the InterAgency Network on Women and Gender Equality (IANWGE)
established a task force on WPS to coordinate the mainstreaming of WPS
into the UN bureaucracy (Otto, 2010: 103). [The WPS agenda has utility
for a range of actors and settings beyond that envisaged by those who
supported the passage of UNSCR 1325 through the Security
Council]{.underline}. For example, McLeod's (2012: 137) research on
Women in Black in Serbia finds that after learning about UNSCR 1325, the
group conceived ways in which the Resolution could be used strategically
to support their existing goals. Prior to their engagement with the WPS
agenda in 2005, Women in Black did not articulate 'security' as one of
their core values. The use of 'mainstream' language on security to
express feminist goals therefore became a strategy to achieve their
pre-existing objectives. In understanding WPS as a 'travelling concept'
we see how it has moved from transnational feminism to formal acceptance
by the UN Security Council, to national and local engagement by
grassroots civil society actors. NATO's adoption of the WPS agenda adds
an additional dimension to this journey. [NATO did not engage with the
WPS as a response to pressure from feminist civil society nor did it
formally consult civil society until the 2014 iteration of the NATO/EAPC
Policy]{.underline}. Despite the initial NATO/EAPC Policy on WPS adopted
in 2007 calling for civil society consultation, this did not occur
formally until seven years later. [Rather, NATO's initial engagement was
the result of state-level advocacy of the issue which framed WPS as part
of NATO's existing concern with the status of women in the military, as
a tool to increase operational effectiveness and also to engage partner
states. This journey served to remove WPS from a direct link to feminist
advocacy.]{.underline} This leaves open the possibility that NATO's
interpretation of UNSCR 1325 has shaped the WPS agenda itself. This is
something we consider further in Chapter 5 where we discuss how the
concept of a 'gender perspective', initially articulated in UNSCR 1325,
has travelled to and been embraced by NATO.

## Perms

### Perm Do Both -- WPS

[So far, cybersecurity, defined as "the preservation -- through policy,
technology, and education -- of the availability, confidentiality, and
integrity of information and its underlying infrastructure to enhance
the security of persons both online and offline," has been a key focus
for policymakers and defense institutions. Weaponising a civilian space
has enormous implications for human rights, especially for women who are
already disadvantaged in conflict settings]{.underline}. While national
security matters, we suggest that cybersecurity needs to take human
rights seriously by centering people's empowerment and well-being. [We
see a need to extend the WPS agenda, including 1325 National Action
Plans (NAPs), to the cyber realm to achieve sustainable peace. The WPS
agenda promotes human security by encouraging the participation of women
in peace and security governance.]{.underline} We envision 1325 as
protecting women, girls, trans, queer, and other sexual and gender
minorities from online GBV and ensuring equal access to cybersecurity
both in terms of access to cyber technologies and participating in
cybersecurity governance. [The WPS agenda could be used in cyberspace
to: • Ensure women from diverse backgrounds are in decision-making
positions in cybersecurity governance and expanding the number of women
in cybersecurity across the board, as well as women's equal access to
cyber technologies]{.underline}. As Brown and Pytlak explain,
participation in cyber is critical to representation. [Without women's
full and equal participation, their perspectives are unlikely to be
represented within cyber policy or their perspective taken seriously in
cyber policy.• Provide for the application of a feminist intersectional
approach regarding cyberspace to understand how women, girls, and
diverse gendered categories experience cyberspace
differently]{.underline}. Cyberspace is not equal, and a
one-size-fits-all policy does not work for everyone, particularly, women
and girls in conflict-affected contexts, who might face unique
challenges while using the cyber realm due to weak cyber laws. • Launch
gender-disaggregated data collection on cyber-space tools and resources
countries and businesses in the private sector (Facebook, Twitter,
Tok-tok) are creating and utilising to make cyberspace safer by
protecting the data privacy and security of marginalised groups,
including women and girls as well as trans, queer, nonbinary and other
sexual and gender minorities face in cybersphere. • [Promote training
for cybersecurity professionals, scholars and policymakers on
gender-specific issues in cybersecurity and recognise that achieving
sustainable peace requires achieving a safe cyberspace.]{.underline} We
build on recent work by Feminist IR scholars who have made a case for
using 1325 and the WPS agenda beyond conflict settings. For instance,
Laura Shepherd argues that since no country is violence-free or full of
gender equality, there is a need to apply 1325 beyond war and postwar
contexts. Similarly, in this piece, we try to expand the scope of
application for the WPS agenda to include cyberspace in all contexts,
with a focus on conflict-affected countries. To do so, more feminist
analysis is needed to help us understand how complex social identities
in the cyber realm shape users' experiences and their interaction with
power structures. [Feminist analysis can shed light on how gender and
other inequalities operate in cyberspace and impact human rights and
uniquely impact women and other marginalised groups living in
conflict-affected countries. We see the WPS agenda as a starting point
for scholarly and policy-focused feminist cyber engagement.]{.underline}

### Perm Do Both -- Critical Friend

#### Perm do both---the aff acts as a critical friend to NATO which is key to nuanced understandings that change institutions and avoid co-optation

**Wright, Hurley, & Gil Ruiz 19**

Women Organising from Within. Routledge Studies in Gender and Security.

Much to the benefit of the feminist IR, there are numerous critical
engagements and conversations between feminists on approaches to the
study of security, war and the institutions that wage them. Sylvester
(2013) and Duncanson (2013) acknowledge a tension between what can be
broadly described as an 'anti-militarist' feminism and what Sylvester
calls 'new' feminist war studies that seek to centralise the accounts of
women as agents within institutions of war (2013: 49) (see also Lobasz
and Sjoberg, 2011: 574). [Sylvester notes unease between women who
self-identify as feminists but depart from common advocacy of peaceful
conflict resolution, or a strident anti-militarism. Similarly, Duncanson
(2013) identifies a tension between feminists who view militaries as
useful in the pursuit of peace (Olsson and Tryggestad, 2001; Kaldor,
2012; Kronsell, 2012) and those who are much more sceptical about the
role and place of militaries and militarism (Whitworth, 2004); between
those whom she calls 'feminist sceptics of military intervention' and
'feminist sceptics' (Duncanson, 2013: 2).]{.underline} This tension
becomes acute when considering sites of feminist research and the role
of feminist researcher: as Sylvester (2013: 39) notes: 'Gender and war
is a very fraught coupling and the men and women who join the
institution of war or work within it can put observers in a conundrum:
to support them, take no position, look the other way?[' What Sylvester
is commenting on is the notion that by centralising institutions of war
and the individuals that choose to work within them as a site of
feminist analysis, this somehow promotes, reinforces and legitimates
those structures. Yet, Kronsell (2005, 2006, 2012) highlights how solely
focusing on women at the 'margins' of International Relations, on those
'outside of hegemonic institutions' such as the military, tends to
underestimate the significance of the transformative work of those women
who work 'inside' such organisations (Kronsell, 2005: 289). In advancing
a 'revitalised' standpoint theory, Kronsell (2005: 289) also argues that
a reluctance to engage with women within hegemonic institutions
perpetuates certain assumptions about them:]{.underline} Women within
such institutions have been perceived as either co-opted or too few to
be representative of women's knowledge or standpoint. Standpoint
theory's tendency to emphasise knowledge generated by women only in
particular 'women's spaces' has led to the implication that an
occasional woman with power is either a male in disguise or a mere
token. It is not our intention to promote, reinforce or legitimate NATO
as an international actor through this book. But it is our intent to
offer a feminist critique of its gendered institutional norms, practices
and structures by centralising the experience of those women who have
worked and continue to work within it. [We see our role as 'critical
friends'.]{.underline} In introducing this concept of a 'critical
friend' we build on the work of Rech et al. (2015: 56). [They contend
that the study of the military, of militarism, and of processes of
militarisation, should not be undertaken solely for its own sake, but
should also be guided by the possibility of engagement with the forces
and institutions responsible, and should not be bashful about doing so.
This is because such institutions are ultimately accountable to the
civilian world, and understanding how they function is necessary to
critique them (rather than dismiss them) (Enloe, 1993; Rech et al.,
2015: 56).]{.underline} Being a 'critical friend' means rejecting
problem-solving approaches which 'takes the world as it finds it' and
aims 'to makes these relationships and institutions work smoothly by
dealing effectively with particular sources of trouble' (Cox, 1981:
128--9). Rather, it means adopting a critical approach which calls these
institutions into question and accounts for the possibility of their
change. [In so doing it opens up the possibility for research to be
normatively guided]{.underline} (Cox, 1981: 129--30). [Being a 'critical
friend' to military institutions therefore entails engaging in complex
and nuanced arguments and situating these in broader political
considerations and in more nuanced ways than simplistic 'pro-military'
or 'anti-military' positions are able to accommodate]{.underline} (Rech
et al., 2015: 56). [It means a commitment to praxis, which necessities
engagement. Military institutions are often secretive, complex and
contradictory, this means critical agendas can be vulnerable to
co-option (as we discuss in Chapter 4). Researchers as 'critical
friends' therefore need to engage in an ongoing process of reflexivity
from the outset of any project.]{.underline}

### A2 Extinction

#### Gender is not the root cause of violence or ontological and cant explain the case \-- violence is constructed by many axes of oppression

Olena **Hankivsky 12**, Professor in the School of Public Policy, Simon
Fraser University, June 2012, Women's health, men's health, and gender
and health: Implications of intersectionality, Social Science &
Medicine,
http://www.sciencedirect.com.turing.library.northwestern.edu/science/article/pii/S0277953612000408

Using an intersectionality framework, [researchers have
noted]{.underline} the [explanatory limitations of single axis designs
centered on]{.underline} sex and [gender]{.underline}. Cole (2009) has
warned that [analyses that focus on gender are problematic because they
often "implicitly assume a host of other social statuses that usually go
unnamed in American culture: middle-class standing, heterosexuality,
able-bodiedness and White race]{.underline}" (p. 173). Others have
explicated similar limitations. For example, [studies in the field of
violence]{.underline} (Bent-Goodley, 2007; Craig-Taylor, 2008; Crenshaw,
1995; Nixon & Humphreys, 2010; Sandelowski, Barroso, & Voils, 2009)
[show that violence against women is not only a matter of gendered power
relationships but is co-constructed with racial and class
stratification, heterosexism, ageism, and other systems of oppression,
some of which may be more salient within such interactions. Research on
cardiovascular disease (CVD)]{.underline} (Brister, Hamdulay, Verma,
Maganti, & Buchanan, 2007; King, LeBlanc, Carr, & Quan, 2007; King,
LeBlanc, Sanguins, & Mather, 2006) [shows that focussing on sex and
gender often obscures the fact that CVD is disproportionately
experienced by racial ethnic and low-income groups whose lives are
shaped by intersecting processes of differentiation along the lines of
age, sex, ethnic group affiliation, socioeconomic class, and
geography]{.underline}. Finally[, HIV/AIDS research]{.underline}
(Dworkin, 2005; Elford, Anderson, Bukutu, & Ibrahim, 2006; Jackson &
Reimer, 2008; Meyer, Costenbader, Zule, Otiashvili, & Kirtadze, 2010;
Young & Meyer, 2005) [demonstrates that gender and sexuality cannot be
separated from other axes including race, class, age, religious
affiliation, and immigration status and the structural economic,
political, and social processes that shape them.]{.underline} For
example, in her analysis of surveillance categories for HIV, Dworkin
(2005) argues that **[pushing beyond a singular]{.underline}**
[sex/gender **system**]{.underline} [to explore the simultaneity of
race, class, and shifting gender relations is vital to the future of the
HIV epidemic and in particular, for making visible bisexual and lesbian
transmission risks]{.underline}. Emerging research thus demonstrates
that **[there are many groups which "do not necessarily identify gender
oppression as the primary frame through which they understand their
lives"]{.underline}** (Nixon & Humphreys, 2010, p. 150). In Canada, as
in many other jurisdictions, this is especially apparent with growing
[immigrant populations]{.underline} whose [health is primarily affected
by dislocation, isolation, loss of identity, culture, and meaningful
employment and Aboriginal/Indigenous populations whose health and
well-being is largely determined by unresolved colonial injustices and
ongoing experiences of racism and poverty]{.underline} (Alfred, 2005;
Waldrum, Herring, & Young, 2006).¶ Further, the emphasis on gender (and
sex) often leads to a focus on differences between women and men. This
helps to explain why so much data continues to be collected, organized,
and presented solely around sex and gender differences even when
similarities between women and men are demonstrated (e.g. Hyde, 2005;
Petersen, 2009), differences among women and among men are often as
significant if not more than between women and men (Crawshaw & Smith,
2009; Varcoe, Hankivsky, & Morrow, 2007), and men are sometimes
subordinate to some women and some women exercise power over some men
(Pease, 2006). Nevertheless, numerous reviews of sex based and gender
differences continue to be produced (Gochfeld, 2010; Read & Gorman,
2010). Moreover, even in some frameworks that seek to include
considerations of both sex and gender, as in the sex and gender based
analysis (SGBA) tool developed in Canada (e.g. Clow et al., 2009),
proposed guides construct lines of interrogation that prioritize
examinations of similarities and differences between women and men. As
Clow et al. (2009) state, "SGBA reminds us to ask questions about
similarities and differences among women and men, such as: Do women and
men have the same susceptibility to lung disease from smoking? Are women
at the same risk as men of contracting HIV/AIDS through heterosexual
intercourse? Are the symptoms of heart disease the same in women and
men?." (p. 1). Within this type of construct, [differences that are
shaped and formed by factors outside of sex and gender are treated as
secondary in importance, if at all.]{.underline}

### Fails -- Policy Key

Heidi, Professor of International Relations and Director of the Centre
for Africa Studies at the University of the Free State, "(Re)framing the
Relationship between Discourse and Materiality in Feminist Security
Studies and Feminist IPE," POLITICS & GENDER, 11 (2) (2015)

While [feminists]{.underline} usually try to ground the meanings that
they study, [theorizing the mundane or]{.underline} the [everyday
may]{.underline} very [well represent a]{.underline} detour ---or even a
**[dead end]{.underline}**---[if bread-and-butter issues related
to]{.underline} the [security]{.underline} and economic well-being of
ordinary women and men [are ignored]{.underline}. [What value does
feminist theorizing]{.underline} (even if it draws from women's lived
experiences) [have in war-affected contexts where meeting **immediate
needs** is **paramount**?]{.underline} [At what point does the
theorizing of the body under such circumstances become a means to
satisfying **intellectual fetishes**?]{.underline} Theorizing the
everyday is messy because it has to contend with the immediate social
setting in which popular culture is inseparable from the economic
materiality of the conditions of oppression. In response to this
dilemma, my aim is to argue for a productive rather than a reductive
relationship between Feminist Security Studies (FSS) and Feminist
(International) Political Economy (FPE), achieved through a reframed
relationship between discursive subjectivity and a structure-centred
materiality. I argue for a more systematic feminist analysis that
reunites FPE and cultural FSS critiques. This analytical synthesis is
based on an understanding of the co-constituted agency of discourse and
materiality underpinned by a postcolonial-feminist attention to the
politics of space. After the Cold War, security became a catch-all
concept for critical variants of IR, but instead of working against
disciplinary fragmentation, "security has settled into each new camp in
particularistic ways" (Sylvester 2013, 618). For FSS the main concern is
to underscore the conceptual necessity of gender to understanding
security. Although scholars have also emphasized the theoretical and
methodological diversity of FSS, I contend that [there is an implicit
hierarchy]{.underline} of sorts [when it comes to which critical
tradition matters more theoretically or
epistemologically]{.underline}---[with a]{.underline} subtle but
**[distinct privileging of the discursive]{.underline}** as evidenced by
the influential contributions of, among others, Judith Butler (1993),
Karin Fierke (2013a), Lene Hansen (2006), and Laura Shepherd (2008).
[FSS]{.underline} thus [tends to focus on the gendered, discursive
construction of forms of violence with **less attention paid to
materialities of**]{.underline} economic **[insecurity]{.underline}**.
In contrast, FPE tends to avoid the security frame and its discursive
implications and concentrates more on gender as a social relation of
inequality and the gendered effects of capitalism or economic
globalization. Poststructuralist scholarship in FSS insists that the
discursive is not privileged over the material and that objects in the
material world and human subjects both take their forms and agencies
relationally, as they are embedded within particular locations.
Similarly, gendered and embodied security is theorized to be the outcome
of relational processes ---performed in, by, and through those
relations. Theory thus makes practice (Foucault 1972). Yet, [thinking
about our bodies as cultural constructs, produced as objects in security
discourse, has a high level of abstraction]{.underline}. [Before we can
analyze discourse about bodies, shouldn't we first make the bodies from
"other worlds,"]{.underline} rooted in everyday struggles of human
insecurity, [feature in IR?]{.underline} [How is attention to
contextualized discourses of individuals or groups without considering
their basic needs different from what liberal feminists are
doing]{.underline}, namely [treating those whose security is at stake as
abstract, silent, rights-bearing individuals with no
culture?]{.underline} Moreover, [for all this talk about interactions
between language and matter (as if they were equal), "**language"
remains the star of the show**]{.underline}, as evidenced in Karin
Fierke's claim that "embodied security is . . . fundamentally bound up
in the interaction between humans and their material environment, both
of which are constituted in and through language" (Fierke 2013b, 16).
Theoretically, materiality should gain agency through the fact that it
cannot ontologically be separated from discursive forces but in practice
discourses treat material practices (bodies) as effects (objects) rather
than causes (subjects), and consequently maintain agency (Wilcox 2012).
**[A subtle hierarchy is]{.underline}** therefore
**[imposed]{.underline}**. Reversing the starting point of the inquiry
may succeed in troubling dualistic thinking but does not transcend it.
[We may have thrown the baby out with the bathwater when we privileged
the effects of cultural constructions of gender difference at the
expense of the **material effects of**]{.underline} bodies, economic
justice, and **[security]{.underline}** (see Fraser 2013). **[There are
clearly limits to discursive analysis]{.underline}**, [especially when
it comes to connecting physical insecurity and the materiality of
insecurity linked to structures]{.underline}. We must therefore look to
the so-called "new materialisms" on posthumanist agency (Connolly 2013),
material feminisms (Hughes 2013), and Feminist IPE. Feminist IPE as a
diverse body of scholarship studies structures, social practices, and
the meanings of the global political economy (Griffin 2010; Peterson
2007). The emphasis falls on specifically gendered bodies while also
foregrounding differences that are based upon material and structural
inequalities as well as intersectional relations of disadvantage (e.g.,
gender, institutionalized racism, or ethnicity). In this regard, FPE may
find itself closer than FSS to a radical definition of human security as
everyday life experiences embedded in global structures of inclusion and
exclusion and can keep FSS honest by guiding it back to a concern with
everyday (economic) insecurities.

### Turn -- Gender Essentialism

#### Traditional feminist understandings habitually entrench wester notions of gender

The basic task of dismantling and decentering the current theoretical
paradigms of mainstream IR by challenging its "western" origins served
as the foundation to call into question the supposed objectivity of
knowledge developed within the boundaries of this discipline (Sign
Systems, and Knowledge). [This ultimately leads to deconstruction of the
masculinities]{.underline}, and consequently, [the femininities derived
from mainstream IR]{.underline}, which challenges the universalism of
its principles. These principles are the basis under which knowledge is
disseminated within the field and they dominate the ways in which we
think about the world. [Thus, to deconstruct and challenge these
principles then "problematizes" all of the concepts and practices
derived from them]{.underline}. When considering how feminist IR
challenged and problematized development, this served as the basis for
the building tasks of practices and politics. [While international
relations and the international system advocate for development as
benevolent, in practice, this concept has been enacted (]{.underline}at
times[) with various self-interested outcomes by those in positions of
power.]{.underline} Tickner pointedly referred to development as a
"western project" and other theorists critiqued the western frame of
development models and practices. Furthermore, if one thinks about the
politics of development, this concept is complexly used to withhold
social goods such as foreign aid or development assistance.¶ [The
buildings tasks of relationships, identities, and connections are
closely intertwined and dependent upon each other, especially in
feminist IR. The literature also challenged]{.underline}, developed,
[and weaved together]{.underline} the various [aspects of identity of
women]{.underline} around the world. Challenging the views of women in
the developing world also involved challenging how women in the
developed world view their own status and position. [Take]{.underline},
for example, [the concepts of complicity and insider/outsider
identities]{.underline}. [The feminist IR literature strongly asserted
that through actions such as underpaid household labor or unfair labor
practices used to produce]{.underline} 57 [globally-shipped goods
(]{.underline}e.g[. buying items produced in sweatshops]{.underline})
[women have participated in aspects of patriarchy that disadvantage
others]{.underline}. Another example is "femocrats" or women in power
who condone---or even advocate---certain policies that are steeped in
hegemonic masculinity, such as war. These are women that have upheld
certain aspects of patriarchy because it is beneficial to maintaining
their own power. Thus, it forces women in the developed world to think
about their relationship and connection to their counterparts in
developing countries, particularly in ways that do not create them as
abstract figures. If these women are oppressed, if they are "third
world"; if they are disadvantaged, then, those in the "first world" are
not disconnected from their position. This oppression did not---and does
not---happen by coincidence. Women in the First World/developed
countries/Global North bear some responsibility, whether implicitly or
explicitly, in maintaining the disadvantaged social status of those
outside the west.¶ Furthermore, an interesting aspect of this analysis
of feminist IR literature was not in how these pieces talked about women
in developing countries or the "Third World," but in how these women
weren't spoken about. Not in terms of making them invisible, but in not
attempting to describe them; not attempting to speak for them, but
straying away from one-dimensional or homogenized views of their lives.
It seemed that the goal was simply to "trouble" the existing images and
ways in which we think about these women and their lives. The task was
not necessarily to describe, but instead, to deconstruct. Perhaps, this
was a method to counter existing, problematic narratives, but without
co-opting the stories of marginalized women for scholarly purposes.¶ The
previously identified themes and categories will be carried forward to
the second part of the discourse analysis on policy literature. The
purpose of the next chapter is to see if any of 58 these objects in
feminist IR literature have influenced and/or appear in the discourse of
international women's development policy.¶ Summary When looking at the
overall discourse of feminist IR literature, [the not only stresses the
idea of adding women to IR, but which women are added and whose voices
are heard]{.underline}. [This is disruptive to the discipline because of
its agendered assumptions]{.underline}. [The texts repeatedly and
purposefully situate gender and international relations **within a
western context**]{.underline}, to serve as a reminder that the
international system has a specific sociocultural frame. [This creates
situated identities within this frame that may have been imposed upon
individuals]{.underline}, **[particularly women in the "Third World"/
"Developing" world/ "Global South]{.underline}**." [By giving examples
of women's agency]{.underline}, particularly in reference to women's
movements and civil society, [it serves to uncover and build an image of
these women]{.underline} [separate from "western" created
concepts]{.underline}. Often, images of marginalized individuals are
depicted in relation to those in power, highlighting the (hierarchical)
differences. Telling a plurality of stories decenters the singular frame
in which one can see the world.¶ [Despite these attempts at
disruption]{.underline}, [the use of dichotomies shows the power of
language and that one can only exist so far "outside the
system"]{.underline} (even when aware of its pitfalls). This "discursive
slippage" is a result of unconscious, habitual, and inherited language
(Hooper, 2001; Runyan & Peterson, 2010). [The continued use of
western-imposed, hierarchical dichotomies means that uncovering new ways
to view international relations requires new language to speak about
international relations.]{.underline} [**Otherwise, feminist IR will**
**disrupt discourse in one context, while entrenching it in
another**.]{.underline}

The field of feminist security studies highlights how "security" is
interrelated to issues of gender and sex in many important ways (Wibben
and Stern 2014; Hudson 2011, 586; see also Sjoberg 2009; Sjoberg and
Martin 2010). [Although feminist security studies strongly challenges
the dominant, repressive, and invariably patriarchal ways in which
national security, international security coalitions, foreign policy
priorities, and defence mechanisms are conceived, it is a considerably
"restrictive" field]{.underline}. Publications in journals such as
Politics and Gender demonstrate that the near-totality of contributors
are cis, white, able-bodied women in Western academia. [Feminist
security studies focuses invariably on the gender binary, thereby
limiting its brand of feminism to cis (and largely white) able-bodied
women. It is a field that seldom accommodates a diversity of
perspectives or includes voices of women of color, Indigenous women, or
Trans and queer feminist scholars and activists]{.underline}. This
approach to feminist security studies perpetuates a cycle of exclusion
and exceptionalism, adjudicating on who gets to articulate what in the
field, and who gets academic credence as a "feminist." [Concluding an
article on feminist security studies, Hudson (2011, 589) calls upon
fellow academics in that research area to avoid inflicting unto others
what has been done unto them in the past in the form of exclusionary
practices and in defining the boundaries of feminist security studies to
say who is in and who is out. In terms of theorizing, critical voices on
the potential of feminist security studies to engage with and
destabilize gendered power relations are receiving increasing scholarly
attention]{.underline} (see, e.g., Åhäll 2016). Yet even such critical
voices take a considerably cisgender feminist turn, with subjective and
restrictive interpretations of what is implied by "feminist." In
Practice: The Gender Binary as the Status Quo in International Politics
The consequences of mostly whitefeminist theorizing of international
relations and security studies can be observed in the agendas and
targets of supranational organizations, regional bodies, and powerful
governments. The UN's gender policies and strategic goals, as well as
those of powerful governments, are structured in a way that perpetuates
gender-related conservatisms and norms, which, to borrow from Ahmed
(2016, 23), are also heteronorms. The UN's concept of gender
mainstreaming involves ensuring that the goal of gender equality is made
central to all activities---policy development, research, advocacy,
legislation, resource allocation, planning, implementation, and
monitoring of programs and projects (UN Women, n.d.). Many scholars of
feminist IR have explored challenges and inconsistencies in the way in
which gender mainstreaming is perceived by the UN and other
supranational bodies (see, e.g., Youngs 2008; Daly 2005; Rees, 2005;
Walby 2005; Perrons, 2005; Beveridge and Nott 2002; Hafner-Burton and
Pollack 2002; True 2003, 2009, 2010). [Gender mainstreaming, as it is
practiced by the international community, persistently interprets
"gender" around the "heteronormative binary" (see Zalewski 2010, 21--22)
and consequently regularly ignores interfaces between race, sex, gender,
nationality, ethnicity, sexuality, and power]{.underline} (25; see also
Jauhola 2010). Today, [UN bodies have begun to pay increased attention
to Transgender issues through their emphasis on sexual orientation,
gender identity/expression, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC),
especially in collaboration with platforms such as the International
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Association (ILGA).
However, the overall ethos of such engagements continues to be somewhat
inconsistent, in that they fail to acknowledge the salient reality that
anti- Trans discrimination---if not discrimination against gender
identities that do not fall within the binary---is inherently linked to
misogyny, patriarchal oppression, and inequities that are at the heart
of gender-related oppression, which especially take their toll on
underprivileged cis women of color in the Global South, Indigenous
peoples across the world, and also women from ethnic minorities in the
West.]{.underline}10 In a similar vein, the UN's women, peace, and
security (WPS) agenda is also essentially founded not only upon a narrow
and restrictive understanding of gender(s) fixed on the gender binary,
but also on the basis of stereotyping (cisgender) women as the
vulnerable "other." [Even when discussing women affected by armed
conflict, WPS resolutions locate the (cisgender) male soldier as the
ultimate referent]{.underline} (Jansson and Eduards 2016, 12). A
fast-growing body of work examines the rationale and problems of
implementing WPS resolutions (Olonisakin, Barnes, and Ikpe 2011; Gizelis
and Olsson 2015; Farr 2011; Barnes 2011; Harrington 2011; Reeves 2012;
Adrian-Paul 2012). Scholars of feminist security studies have also
critically engaged with the WPS agenda (Pratt and Richter-Devroe 2011;
Schnabel and Tabyshalieva 2012; Boyd 2014). Critics highlight that
Resolution 1325 does not confront the structural roots of gender
inequalities, including entrenched understandings of patriarchy,
masculinity, and militarized power (Barnes 2011). Resolution 1325 and
the subsequent WPS resolutions (including Resolution 2122 of 2013)
largely perceive women through a prism of wartime victimhood (see, e.g.,
Meger 2016). This logic locates the cis male soldier as the agent of
preventing violence against women, and, as scholars have repeatedly
pointed out, legitimizes military activity once sexual violence against
women is addressed. In sum, the UN's conception of gender equates cis
women and cisnormative femininity with peace and is entrenched in
cisnormative gender stereotypes (Shepherd 2008). This reading of women
in contexts of armed conflict fails to identify patriarchy as the
primary cause of violence against women, which prevents UN resolutions
from consistently addressing the exclusion of women and gender-plural
people from conflict management initiatives. It also prevents
supranational bodies (and governments) from focusing on a logic of
addressing the visceral excesses of patriarchal attitudes and developing
a consistent logic of women's empowerment, especially in post-war
contexts in the Global South. The problems inherent in the WPS agenda
and gender mainstreaming primarily stem from the fact that the very
authority that drafts these policy guidelines is also one that is
largely spearheaded by influential states with power acquired through
centuries of colonization, and by white settler-controlled authorities
that are squarely responsible for the human, socioeconomic, cultural,
and linguistic genocide of First Peoples, especially women and
gender-plural peoples of Turtle Island and elsewhere. Since its
inception, the UN has proved to be incapable of addressing atrocities
committed by these powers upon non-white peoples. Western superpowers
have carte blanche on the international sphere, often justifying their
military aggressions and violence in foreign lands on the basis of
protectionist discourses along (cis)gender faultlines, such as the
often-repeated "objective" of protecting "women and children," echoing a
discourse of masculinist protectionism built upon a patriarchal and
hence patronizing understanding of democratic citizenship and world
politics. In the face of such discourses, the UN has been conspicuously
silent and partaking in the agendas of Western powers. This calls into
question the UN's capability, in its present form, of addressing the
challenges facing women/gender minorities in contexts of armed conflict
and natural disaster. [An effective strategy must be grounded in the
recognition of a broader understanding of gender beyond the binary, and
a decolonizing logic of empowering cis and Trans women and all other
gender-plural people]{.underline}. Most importantly, such an approach
must profoundly challenge the logics of warfare as articulated by
powerful states and ensure that women and gender-plural people occupy
frontline roles in all aspects of conflict management and resolution
initiatives. It is in articulating a policy perspective of this nature,
with decolonizing, equity, justice, and empowerment at the center, that
a Transfeminist approach to IR will gain prime significance. As outlined
below, [key ideas in Transfeminism, when applied to IR, provide a
promising avenue to develop a strongly intersectional, feminist, Global
South(s)-focused and decolonizing twenty-first-century perspective on
world politics]{.underline}.
