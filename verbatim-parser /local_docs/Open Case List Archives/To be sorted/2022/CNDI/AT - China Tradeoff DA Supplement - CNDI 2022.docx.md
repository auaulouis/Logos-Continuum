### 2AC \-\-- Pivot Fails

[As [China's armed forces grow in strength]{.mark},
[]{.mark}sophistication and confidence, **[U.S.-led]{.mark}** military
[**deterrence** in the **Indo-Pacific** is **losing its
bite**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Take the United States' military presence
in the region. It has about 55,000 military personnel in Japan and
28,000 in South Korea. Several thousand more are deployed across
Australia, the Philippines, Thailand and Guam. [This posture has barely
changed since the 1950s. But [plans to **reinvigorate the U.S.
presence** have been stymied by]{.mark} inadequate [**budgets**,
**competing priorities** and a lack of consensus]{.mark} in Washington
on how to deal with China.]{.underline} The Pentagon has increased
investments in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence,
and cyber- and space-based systems to prepare for a possible high-tech
conflict with China in the 2030s. But the balance of power is likely to
shift decidedly in China's favor by the time they are deployed unless
the United States brings new resources to the table soon. President
Biden this year submitted the largest defense budget ever in dollar
terms, but much of the increase will be swallowed up by skyrocketing
inflation. [Mr. [Biden]{.mark}, like former President Donald Trump,
[is]{.mark} thus [falling short of]{.mark} a target of 3 percent to 5
percent real annual **[budget growth]{.mark}**, a bipartisan goal set
even before the Ukraine war and often cited as the minimum the Pentagon
needs in today's era of great-power competition.]{.underline} While the
U.S. military is globally dispersed, China can concentrate its forces on
winning a future conflict in its own neighborhood. It now has the
capability. [China has the world's largest navy and Asia's biggest air
force and an imposing arsenal of missiles designed to deter the United
States from projecting military power into the Western Pacific in a
crisis.]{.underline} China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier is
nearing completion, and other new hardware is being developed or is
already in service. Beijing is also raising alarm with its readiness to
project that strength. While much attention is focused on its behavior
toward Taiwan, China is building and militarizing artificial islands in
the South China Sea. It also broke ground on an expanded naval port in
Cambodia last week, which may one day provide its first military
foothold in another Asian country. A security agreement with the Solomon
Islands could lead to something similar, and Beijing is aggressively
courting other Pacific nations. America's military position in Asia, by
contrast, has been hampered by decades of preoccupation with Middle East
conflicts. [[The war in Ukraine has morphed into a **long-term \$54
billion** commitment and forced]{.mark} Mr. [Biden to **delay**]{.mark}
and redraft [his administration's]{.mark} National [Defense
Strategy]{.mark} and National Security Strategy]{.underline} ---
critical documents that lay out global priorities and resource needs ---
as officials grapple with how to manage China and Russia at the same
time. Mr. Biden's team ended the lengthy and costly U.S. involvement in
Afghanistan, but that has not freed up many resources for the
Indo-Pacific. Washington must not lose sight of the fact that China is a
far greater security threat than Russia, now and in the long term.

### 2AC \-\-- NATO Counterbalance \-\-- China Prioritization

#### NATO focusing on China now -- no tradeoff

**Wilson, Lawless, and Corbet 6-28** (The Associated Press is an
independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.
Founded in 1846, AP today remains the most trusted source of fast,
accurate, unbiased news in all formats and the essential provider of the

<https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-nato-taiwan-jens-stoltenberg-ab60b2843268edde1ec29c43d421a26f>)

[**[NATO]{.mark}** has for the first time [**singled out China** as one
of its **strategic priorities**]{.mark} for the next decade, [warning
about its]{.mark} growing military [ambitions]{.mark}, confrontational
rhetoric **[toward Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline} and other neighbors,
and increasingly close ties to Russia. While Russia's war against
Ukraine has dominated discussions at the NATO summit, [China earned a
place Wednesday among the Western alliance's most worrying security
concerns. "China is substantially building up its military forces,
including nuclear weapons, bullying its neighbors, threatening
Taiwan]{.underline} \... monitoring and controlling its own citizens
through advanced technology, and spreading Russian lies and
disinformation," Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said after
presenting NATO's ten-year Strategic Concept. "China is not our
adversary," Stoltenberg said, "but we must be clear-eyed about the
serious challenges it represents." The strategic document directed its
harshest language at Russia, but the [mere [mention of **China was
significant**]{.mark}; the 2010 document did not discuss China. The
official turn by NATO puts the world's largest military alliance based
on the United States armed forces on guard against China,]{.underline}
which has the world's second-largest economy and a rapidly growing
military, both in numbers and in top-notch technology. "One of the
things that (China's) doing is seeking to undermine the rules-based
international order that we adhere to, that we believe in, that we
helped build," said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. "And if
China's challenging it in one way or another, we will stand up to that."
China has yet to condemn Russia's four-month long war against Ukraine
and has criticized sanctions brought against Moscow by NATO members. A
year ago, Russia and China extended a friendship treaty promising even
more "strategic cooperation" in defending their common interests. That
was followed up in November with an agreement to strengthen their
military ties. Weeks before Russia's February invasion, Chinese leader
Xi Jinping hosted his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin for a summit at
which they pledged a partnership that had "no limits." [[Western leaders
are concerned that **Russia's aggression** in Ukraine could **embolden
China**]{.mark} to be more assertive over Taiwan.]{.underline} China
considers Taiwan a part of its territory with no right to independent
recognition as a state or representation on the world stage. Speaking at
an event in Madrid that was not part of the NATO summit, [British
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said that unless China is checked "there is
a real risk that they draw the wrong idea which results in a
catastrophic miscalculation such as invading Taiwan,"]{.underline}
referring to the self-governing island that [China]{.underline} claims
as a province. However, in a move interpreted to show it was somewhat
uneasy over the war in Ukraine, China voted to abstain in a United
Nations motion to demand Russia halt its attack. China has greatly
increased its diplomatic reach via foreign investment, above all in
central Asia and Africa. Now it [is seeking to match that with greater
military might, especially in the South China Sea where it has built
bases on disputed islands.]{.underline} The U.S. navy has pushed back by
conducting drills in those waters.

Reassure Allies of Focus on China", Th eNew York Times, May 19 2022,
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/us/politics/biden-trip-asia.html)

[President [Biden embarked Thursday on his first diplomatic mission to
Asia]{.mark} since taking office]{.underline}, hoping [t[o demonstrate
that the **U**]{.mark}nited [**S**]{.mark}tates [remained focused on
countering China]{.mark}]{.underline}, even as his administration
stage-managed a war against Russia in Europe. With his original strategy
of pivoting foreign policy attention to Asia effectively blown up by
Russia's invasion of Ukraine[, Mr. [Biden]{.mark} has now [shifted to
the argument that **there can be no trade-off** between Europe and
Asia]{.mark}]{.underline} and that only the United States can bring
together the democracies of the East and West to stand up to autocracy
and aggression in both spheres. For Mr. Biden, finding his balance
between the twin imperatives will require geopolitical maneuvering that
would challenge any president. The competing demands on his time and
attention were on display on Thursday as he squeezed in a last-minute
meeting at the White House with the leaders of Sweden and Finland to
welcome their decisions to join NATO before heading to Joint Base
Andrews to board Air Force One for the long flight to South Korea. [And
days before that, Mr. Biden hosted Southeast Asian nations at the White
House]{.underline} to detail new investments in clean energy and
maritime assets, part of [an effort to prevent China from dominating the
Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} "We are preparing for all contingencies,
including the possibility that such a provocation would occur while we
are in Korea or in Japan," Jake Sullivan, the president's national
security adviser, told reporters this week before Mr. Biden departed
Washington. Mr. Sullivan has consulted his counterpart in China in
recent days to discuss, among other things, the prospect of a North
Korean provocation. [Mr. [Biden's trip is also aimed at **reassuring
allies** in the region who were rattled by]{.mark} President Donald J.
[Trump's]{.mark} unorthodox [approach to Asia in recent
years]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Mr. Trump pulled the United States
out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an American-negotiated regional
trade pact meant to counter China's growing economic sway]{.underline}.
He repeatedly questioned American troop commitments to South Korea and
the mutual defense agreement with Japan, while engaging in what he
called a "love affair" with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Bruce Klingner, a
longtime C.I.A. analyst on Asia now at the Heritage Foundation, said
South Korea and Japan were increasingly nervous about North Korea's
capabilities and Mr. Trump's threats to pull back from the region.
"Biden should provide unequivocal assurances of U.S. dedication to the
defense of our allies and affirm the U.S. extended deterrence guarantee
of nuclear, conventional and missile defense forces," he said. A couple
of recent studies have concluded that even though American political
influence in the region has risen again with Mr. Trump leaving power,
[the United States has continued to lose economic influence because of
the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership]{.underline}. "The
biggest criticism of the administration in Asia right now is they have
no economic strategy and they're ceding the field to China," said
Michael J. Green, the incoming chief executive of the United States
Studies Centre in Australia and a former Asia adviser to President
George W. Bush. To address that[, Mr. Biden plans to unveil a new
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which is a pale shadow of a full-scale
trade pact but will outline various mutual priorities like digital trade
and supply chain security.]{.underline} American officials hope it will
be joined by many of the countries still in the Trans-Pacific
Partnership. [Mr. Green called that an important first step but one that
behind the scenes, the Japanese, Australians and others find inadequate
for the moment]{.underline} --- although they are unlikely to say so
publicly. "A lot of their interest is to show the U.S. is back and China
is not going to write the economic rules," Mr. Green said. Matthew P.
Goodman, senior vice president for economics at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, said that if the Biden administration did not
offer greater access to the American market, nations in the region would
be looking for direct funding to expand infrastructure and the digital
economy. "I think a lot of partners are going to look at that list and
say: That's a good list of issues. I'm happy to be involved," said Mr.
Goodman. "But, you know, are we going to get any tangible benefits out
of participating in this framework?" In crafting the economic framework,
Biden administration officials have focused in part on labor and
environmental standards. But without the benefits of lowered trade
barriers, other countries may be reluctant to make costly commitments.
"The bottom line is the United States is not coming to the table with
market access," said Sheila A. Smith, a senior fellow for Asia-Pacific
studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. "And that's the trade
piece. That's what the region is looking for." During stops in Seoul and
Tokyo, Mr. Biden will encounter two new partners who are both seen as
more aligned with American priorities and likely to have good chemistry
with the president, according to Mr. Green and other analysts and
officials. The first, President Yoon Suk-yeol of South Korea, was
inaugurated on May 10 and has taken a stronger approach to China and
North Korea than his predecessor, while the second, Prime Minister Fumio
Kishida of Japan, was elected just last October and enjoys a level of
popularity that is likely to keep him in office for the duration of Mr.
Biden's term, unlike the frequent revolving-door governments in Tokyo.
"Inevitably North Korea is going to make itself front and center as part
of the agenda for a Biden-Yoon summit," said Scott A. Snyder, the
director of U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. "Just
the fact that that speculation is out there makes it necessary for the
two leaders to talk about extended deterrence, how that works, and to
try to deepen their shared commitment to security and defense." [While
in Tokyo, Mr. [Biden will also meet]{.mark} with other leaders of the
so-called Quad --- the United States, [Japan, Australia and
India]{.mark} --- his second time [sitting down with his counterparts in
a bloc meant to resist Chinese hegemony in the
region]{.mark}.]{.underline} With Australian elections scheduled for
Saturday, it remained unclear who would attend the meeting, on Tuesday.
But the most complicating factor may be how Mr. Biden approaches Prime
Minister Narendra Modi of India, who has been hesitant to condemn
Russia's invasion of Ukraine out of fear of undermining security ties
with Moscow. Moreover, Mr. Biden's promise to combat autocracies around
the world will be put to the test with Mr. Modi, who has marginalized
and maligned minority Muslims. But the president's aides said he can
press the international campaign to thwart Russian aggression while
still navigating the diplomatic complexities of the Asian-Pacific region
and reaffirming America's role in this part of the world. "He remains
focused on ensuring that our efforts in those missions are successful,"
said Mr. Sullivan, "but he also intends to seize this moment, this
pivotal moment, to assert bold and confident American leadership in
another vital region of the world."

easily blockaded to prevent supplies from getting in. Lose Taiwan to
China and the US could lose the Western Pacific. Lose the Western

has of 'decoupling' from China would take an enormous hit if Taiwan
fell, given its outsized role in the semiconductor industry. Ending
overreliance on Taiwan is not an overnight task either, any more than

[Two years ago, in what would be his first major speech on Taiwan,
Chinese President [Xi Jinping warned that Taiwan's reunification was
inevitable]{.mark}, saying that "we make no promise to renounce the use
of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary
means"]{.underline} and that "Taiwan's independence goes against the
trend of history and will lead to a dead end". Earlier this week,
[Taiwan's Defence Minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, said [that military tensions
between China and Taiwan are at their highest]{.mark} in four decades,
warning that [Beijing will]{.mark} be in a position to [launch a]{.mark}
full-scale [invasion in 2025]{.mark}.]{.underline} "For the military,
the current situation is the grimmest in the more than 40 years since I
joined the service," he told Parliament. "It is capable now, but it has
to calculate what it would cost, and what kind of outcome it wishes to
achieve." He warned that even a single "miscalculation" or "slight
carelessness" could spark a full-blown crisis. While nearly the entire
academic field of international relations has long predicted war between
a rising China and a declining US is inevitable because great-power war
typically occurs at the "intersection of one hegemon's rise and
another's decline" -- otherwise known as Thucydides Trap -- a growing
chorus of security elites are arguing an inverse of this theory. "The
United States needs to prepare for a major war, not because its rival is
rising but because of the opposite," argue Hal Brands, a resident
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and Michael Beckley,
associate professor of political science at Tufts University. Drawing
comparisons between Nazi Japan and Imperial Japan in the lead-up to the
Second World War, they argue that [[China is reaching its most
threatening point now]{.mark} because its economy and military
production capacity has peaked at the same time that it is being
increasingly shunned, condemned and isolated]{.underline}, as a result
of its mishandling and cover-up of the Coronavirus pandemic outbreak,
its persecution of its ethnic Uyghur minority, and aggressive military
expansionism in the South China Sea and Himalayas. The recent
multi-trillion-dollar collapse of property developer Evergrande, and the
more recent billion-dollar collapse of another, Fantasia Holdings Group,
reveals an economy drowning in a culmination of years of bad debt, poor
decisions, corruption and negligence. These realities could force
Beijing to take on a "now or never mentality... and grab what it can
before it's too late", warn Brand and Beckley, who argue that "the most
dangerous trajectory in world politics is a long rise followed by the
prospect of a sharp decline". Adding further humiliation to President Xi
Jinping's leadership was the unexpected but crushing defeat of the
pro-China KMT party in last year's Taiwanese presidential election. [For
all of these reasons, the US, along with the UK Australia, Japan and
India are behaving in a manner that suggests their respective [military
leaders believe that war in the Taiwan Strait]{.mark}, and/or elsewhere
in Indo Pacific [is inevitable]{.mark}]{.underline} within the next
decade, with the recent establishment of actual and would-be security
alliances -- AUKUS and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Their
collective beliefs and actions were vindicated by comments delivered in
Chinese state media on Thursday, warning that the threat of war is
"real" and that it "may be triggered at any time". [Ultimately[, there
are very few reasons to believe]{.mark} that a US-China [war over Taiwan
won't materialise within this decade]{.mark}]{.underline} or the next --
making the breakaway and sovereign island state arguably the most
pivotal in international politics for the foreseeable future.

#### China plans to attack this fall

Planned Taiwan Invasion in Fall, Alleged Russian Intel Leak Claims,"

Taiwan\'s top diplomat said he couldn\'t speak on the authenticity of a
purported [Russian intelligence document that claimed Chinese President
[Xi]{.mark} Jinping had [plans to annex]{.mark} the island nation
**[this fall]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [[Joseph Wu]{.mark}, Taiwan\'s
minister of foreign affairs, [said]{.mark}]{.underline} on Wednesday
that his country would have to prepare regardless. \"[No
matter]{.underline} if or [[**when** China decides to attack us]{.mark},
[we must]{.mark} always [be ready to defend
ourselves]{.mark},\"]{.underline} he told reporters in Taipei. During a
defense committee hearing in the island\'s legislature, [Wu told
lawmakers that [he was aware]{.mark} of media reports about [the
document]{.mark} said to be [written by an]{.mark} anonymous [analyst
with Russia\'s Federal Security Service]{.mark} calling themself [\"Wind
of Change.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} The foreign minister said he wasn\'t
able to verify the alleged FSB document, but said Taiwan\'s own
intelligence services were closely monitoring relevant chatter. [The
letter in question is part of [a series published by]{.mark}
France-based Russian dissident Vladimir Osechkin, [a human rights
lawyer]{.mark} who runs []{.mark}gulagu-net.ru, a website documenting
abuses in Russian jails. Osechkin claims to have received seven letters
since Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline} The FSB whistleblower
has painted a detailed picture of fear and chaos inside Russia\'s
principal intelligence service, where apparently none but a select few
were aware of Putin\'s plans. Christo Grozev, the executive director of
investigative journalism group Bellingcat, said earlier this month that
his FSB contacts believe the whistleblower to be authentic, even if they
didn\'t agree with the conclusions of his analysis. In the fourth letter
to Osechkin, dated March 9, the author describes the difficult position
in which Moscow has put Beijing because of Putin\'s decision to invade
Ukraine, a move that united the West and turned Russia into such a
pariah that China would find it hard to offer support. \"Because of the
war, Russia has such a negative image for a number of countries that the
United States can easily push sanctions against China, at least with the
Europeans, if it risks circumventing the sanctions on Russia,\" the
letter read. \"China depends on exports so much that, coupled with its
dependence on commodity prices...this would be almost a fatal blow.\"
The whistleblower continued: [\"Not only that[: Xi Jinping was]{.mark}
at least [tentatively considering the capture of Taiwan in the
autumn---he needs]{.mark} his own small [victory]{.mark} in order [to be
re-elected]{.mark} for a third term---there is a colossal power struggle
among the \[party\] elite. Now, after the events in Ukraine, this window
of opportunity has shut, which gives the United States the opportunity
to both blackmail Xi and negotiate with his \[political\] rivals on
favorable terms.\"]{.underline}

#### Xi will invade -- re-election

While China has been able to make great technological strides of its own
in recent years, what has really helped its advancement is its access to
Western innovations. During President Xi's next two terms, that access
is likely to be significantly restricted. Once China can no longer
easily use and copy American, European and Japanese tech to boost its
own industries, the government will need to find ways other than
increasing productivity to raise revenue -- for example by increasing
taxes. The tax burden in China is already hefty, and adding to the
weight will likely hurt the poor more than benefit them. Unlike his
predecessor Hu Jintao, President [[Xi]{.mark} is an ambitious man who
[constantly feels the need to demonstrate his infallibility.]{.mark}
This desire is not only in his nature, but is dictated by the immense
pressure he is under -- and the more he centralizes power in his own
hands, the greater that pressure becomes. [Once]{.mark} President [Xi is
"reelected,"]{.mark} the [uncertainties regarding]{.mark} China's
[economy and foreign policy will multiply]{.mark}. [If]{.mark} the
[economy falters,]{.mark} he will want to draw the country's attention
to other issues -- [Taiwan is the low-hanging fruit]{.mark}
here.]{.underline} For at least the next three years, however, retaking
Taiwan by force will prove too costly for China. On the other hand,
[[Beijing could achieve]{.mark} two [goals by taking Pratas Island
first,]{.mark} which is currently [occupied by
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} That type of operation would allow
China to flex its military muscle vis-a-vis Taiwan, while potentially
deterring neighbors or Western nations from pushing too hard against its
claims in the South China Sea. [At the same time, [Beijing will]{.mark}
further [intensify its pressure]{.mark} on Taipei [by
blacklisting]{.mark} prominent [figures and institutions]{.mark} it sees
as [favoring Taiwanese independence, hoping to strong-arm the island

[[The]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} long
[played]{.mark} [a key role]{.mark} [in the]{.mark} [territorial
dispute]{.mark}. [It]{.mark} initially [signed a]{.mark} bilateral
[defense agreement with Taiwan in 1954]{.mark} [and]{.mark} over the
years [supplied the island with armaments]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even
[after recognizing the Chinese Communist government in Beijing in 1979,
the U.S. has adhered to position of "strategic ambiguity" when it comes
to]{.underline} the question of [an American response to a Chinese
attack on Taiwan.]{.underline} But today, with U.S.-Chinese relations at
one of the lowest points in recent memory---and as the Chinese military
takes increasingly provocative military actions toward Taiwan---the
fears of war have increased. So, too, have the calls for the U.S. to
ratchet up its efforts to defend Taiwan, including the potential use of
military force. The flames have been fanned by a host of military
figures and foreign policy pundits. Admiral Philip Davidson, commander
of U.S. military forces in the Pacific, got the party started last March
when he warned a Senate committee that China could invade Taiwan "in the
next six years.". Writing in *The Wall Street Journal,* former Trump
Defense official Elbridge Colby [ramped up the threat-mongering by

and commercial satellite imagery shows that China practices large-scale
attacks on U.S. forces in the region." In the Bible of the foreign
policy establishment, *Foreign Affairs,* Orianna Skylar Mastro, a fellow
at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International
Studies, [warned](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-06-03/china-taiwan-war-temptation) that
"whereas Chinese leaders used to view a military campaign to take the
island as a fantasy, now they consider it a real possibility."
Yes, [China could invade
Taiwan](https://www.heritage.org/asia/commentary/yes-china-could-invade-taiwan),
says the Heritage Foundation. And Taiwan's top defense
official---perhaps not surprisingly---warned recently that China will be
able to mount [a "full-scale" invasion of
Taiwan](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/06/asia/taiwan-defense-minister-china-attack-intl-hnk/index.html) by
2025.Some U.S. policymakers have taken these warnings to heart.
[Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton has called for the U.S. to end its policy
of "strategic ambiguity" and make clear its willingness to defend Taiwan
against a Chinese invasion.]{.underline} Former U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations Nikki Haley warned recently that "if China takes control
of Taiwan, Beijing will be emboldened to seize other territories around
the globe" and called on the U.S. to increase pressure on China,
including a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics scheduled to be held in
Beijing. [But how legitimate are these fears? [Is the]{.mark} prospect
of a [Chinese invasion of Taiwan a]{.mark} serious and [urgent
concern?]{.mark} The answer is ["not very."]{.mark}]{.underline} And
it's a view, ironically, endorsed by the Pentagon. Earlier this month,
the Defense Department released its annual report to Congress on
"Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of
China." While the report lays out the ways in which [[China's
"P]{.mark}eople's [L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy"]{.underline} is
seeking to modernize its forces, the [[threat to Taiwan of]{.mark} armed
[invasion]{.mark} [is]{.mark} still [minimal at best]{.mark}:
[Large-scale]{.mark} amphibious [invasion]{.mark} [is]{.mark} one of the
most [complicated and difficult]{.mark} military operations, requiring
air and maritime superiority, the rapid buildup and sustainment of
supplies onshore, and uninterrupted support.]{.underline} An attempt to
invade Taiwan would likely strain PRC's armed forces and invite
international intervention. These stresses, combined with the PRC's
combat force attrition and the complexity of urban warfare and
counterinsurgency, even assuming a successful landing and breakout, make
an amphibious invasion of Taiwan a significant political and military
risk. One might expect that a country intent on launching the largest
and most difficult amphibious invasion in history would be making
intense preparations. That's not happening. As the Pentagon report
notes, Chinese naval investments have focused on building up the
capacity to launch "regional and eventually global expeditionary
missions rather than the large number of landing ship transports and
medium landing craft that would be necessary for a large-scale direct
beach assault." The Pentagon also finds that while China is focusing on
conducting joint operations that involve forces from the army, navy, and
air force, as of present it currently lacks such capabilities. The
soldiers and officers who make up China's military today have virtually
no direct combat experience. That the Chinese military enjoys vast
military superiority vis-à-vis Taiwan is not in doubt. But that such
resources can be used to mount an amphibious assault is something else
altogether. The Chinese military last fought a war in 1979 against
Vietnam, and the PLA was badly bloodied. That means that the soldiers
and officers who make up China's military today have virtually no direct
combat experience. China's own media outlets have, according to [[the
Pentagon, noted the PLA's shortcomings]{.mark}, which [include
that]{.mark} "[commanders]{.mark} [can]{.mark}no[t]{.mark} (1) judge
situations; (2) understand higher authorities' intentions; (3) [make
operational decisions]{.mark}; (4) [deploy forces;]{.mark} and, (5)
[manage]{.mark} unexpected [situations]{.mark}."]{.underline} These
problems would be challenging enough in a conventional conflict. For
[a]{.underline} complex invasion of Taiwan, they would render such
efforts virtually impossible. One [big reason is that Taiwan is about as
inhospitable an environment as can be imagined for an amphibious
invasion.]{.underline} Ian Easton, a defense expert who has written
extensively about Taiwan defense strategy, wrote earlier this year that
the country's "coastal terrain ... is a defender's dream come true.
Taiwan has only 14 small invasion beaches, and they are bordered by
cliffs and urban jungles." Easton also notes that "many of Taiwan's
outer islands bristle with missiles, rockets, and artillery guns. Their
granite hills have been honeycombed with tunnels and bunker systems."

## AT: Philippines Add-on

[China has parked its fishing fleet in waters claimed by the
Philippines. Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte has fulminated
ineffectively. So far, at least, the [Biden]{.mark} administration [has
declined to go to war on Manila's behalf.]{.mark} But the possibility
remains so long as the U.S. foolishly guarantees Philippine
security.]{.underline} [Indeed, some things never change. One is [the
**limited value** of the **Philippines as an
ally**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Its people are friendly and welcoming ---
and quite pro‐​American. But [[it is a **semi‐​failed state** with a
military to match]{.mark}. Manila is a sad example of how the US has
picked up the old German habit of allying with the least stable nations
possessing the weakest militaries --- as Berlin did with Austro‐​Hungary
in World War I and Italy in World War II.]{.underline} In the case of
Washington the primes useless partner is the Philippines. The
relationship wouldn't matter so much if Manila didn't expect America to
protect not only its home islands, but also every useless piece of rock
claimed by the Philippines against China, such as Scarborough Shoal. If
Beijing and Washington end up at war --- a horrific possibility --- the
cause should be more serious than the Philippines[. Manila is as an
American ally because of blatant US imperialism]{.underline}. The early
Americans revolted against empire and eschewed overseas adventurism as
they overspread the North American continent. However, the Sirens of
Asia attracted Washington. After the US went to war with Spain, formally
to liberate Cuba promoted by a simultaneously scurrilous and scandalous
"Yellow Press" propaganda campaign, American forces seized the
Philippines as well. Famed imperialists declared that the oceans made
the archipelago contiguous, and thus an appropriate target of
annexation. Washington should drop its defense guarantee and begin
negotiations to turn the faux mutual defense treaty into a real treaty
of mutual cooperation. Alas, the Filipinos had other ideas, having
already launched a domestic independence movement. What followed was
three years of ruthless irregular warfare, featuring "concentration
zones," which US soldiers compared to Washington's veritable
extermination campaigns against native Americans. War crimes mixed with
starvation to kill 200,000 or more Filipino civilians. Resentment long
lingered, especially in some Muslim‐​majority islands, such as Mindanao,
where armed opposition to the central government continues. Even Duterte
raised the issue, demanding the return of the famed Balangiga Bells,
taken as war booty and which, he reasonably contended, "are reminders of
the gallantry and heroism of our forebears ... who resisted the American
colonization and sacrificed their lives in the process." Washington
finally granted the archipelago's independence in 1946, after the
Philippines' liberation from Japan. The US approved the 1951 Mutual
Defense Treaty, which, like similar agreements with South Korea, Japan,
and Europe (NATO), effectively ran only one way, committing the US to
defend the Philippines. Four decades later a deteriorating bilateral
relationship and volcanic eruption pushed America out of both Clark
Airfield and Subic Bay. The departure was long overdue. [[The
archipelago]{.mark} obviously [**matters not at all** to defending
America]{.mark} itself.]{.underline} Washington would prefer that Manila
rather than Beijing control resources and waterways in the region, but
[[**the practical impact** on the US **is
marginal**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Base access always is useful. However,
no Philippine president, even one calmer and friendlier than Rodrigo
Duterte, would likely make his or her nation available for American
military operations against the PRC except to defend against an unlikely
attack on the archipelago. Aiding America against Beijing would make the
Philippines a permanent enemy of China, which will always be close by.

[In 1964, when China first tested nuclear weapons, [Mao]{.mark} Zedong
[used to claim that the country was populous enough to survive
a]{.mark}n all-out [nuclear attack]{.mark}. [His successors are under no
such illusion]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [And Mao's statement was made in
the context of announcing a "no first strike" policy, to which China has
adhered ever since]{.underline}.]{.mark} [[There is no evidence that
China has any intention of using nuclear weapons except as a deterrent
to a nuclear attack by another power]{.mark}]{.underline} The mutual
sabre-rattling associated with South China Sea mythology is beneficial
to a variety of actors in the United States, China and elsewhere. The
military-industrial complex, against which President Eisenhower warned
60 years ago, is powerful in every country, and always seeks to promote
preparation for large-scale war as well as the routine use of military
power for political and commercial ends. [Nationalist politicians
promote territorial claims of all kinds, and exaggerate their
importance.]{.underline} And both Chinese and Taiwanese governments have
good reasons to keep the idea of an invasion of Taiwan alive.
