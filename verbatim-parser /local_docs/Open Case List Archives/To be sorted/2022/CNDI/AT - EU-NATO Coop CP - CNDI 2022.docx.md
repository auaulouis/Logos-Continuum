In the United States, several commentators point out that a more
integrated procurement system at the European level will negatively
impact U.S.-EU trade relations in the defense industry.72 Although some
economic losses for the United States are indeed possible, there are
ways to contain them and of course [an EU with a stronger defense would
make a more reliable partner for the United States]{.underline}. In
fact, [the **U.S. and EU** are currently discussing administrative
agreements]{.underline} with the EDA to allow the United States to
participate in PESCO projects. Through a franker dialogue[, the two
sides of the Atlantic **could strengthen the defense market without
resorting to protectionist stances on either side**]{.underline}. This
is particularly relevant [considering the strong ties between the U.S.
and EU defense industries**; they both could benefit from deeper
cooperation**]{.underline} and exchanges [on the technological level,
and from free and fair competition in the trans-Atlantic defense market
based on common rules and standards]{.underline}.

First, [the EU could be a valuable partner for the U.S. and NATO in this
theater]{.underline} given its growing economic and regulatory power,
especially related to fair-trade practices and human rights protection.
Second, NATO could help promote standards and interoperability (for
example, through procurement coordination between NATO and the EU as
described earlier). Increased interoperability not just through NATO but
also EU forces could help to quickly mobilize forces in case of
conflict, [**as well as serve as a deterrent regarding
China.**]{.underline} The EU could also offer support through its
European Peace Facility, designed to provide assistance to partner
countries to increase their security and defense capabilities.83
However, regardless of the type of assistance provided, without clear
rules for standardization and convergent strategies for procurement and
military strengthening, the two organizations (and their member states)
risk competing with one another for strategic and market advantages.

### NATO-EU Coop Fails

#### [Technical impracticalities]{.underline} between EU states and [ideological divergences]{.underline} mean EU-NATO cooperation fail.

\[Edited\] for ableist langauge

However, [the difference in how commitment to respective sets of values
is executed in NATO and EU results with a **wide portfolio of
cooperational problems**, ranging from bureaucratic to strategic,
**despite** their **intention to work together.**]{.underline} Could
there be comprehensive and mutually respectful cooperation between the
two organizations on security issues? Would this cooperation be
wearproof given the bilateral conflicts brought up by non-joint members,
such as in the Cyprus dilemma? This article surveys how [bilateral and
regional conflicts **challenge** the international **resolve for**
transatlantic **security cooperation**]{.underline}, in which NATO and
EU share common milito-political interest. The European Common Security
and Defense Policy: Boon or Bane The [Common Security and Defense Policy
(CSDP)]{.underline}, known before 2009's Lisbon Treaty as the European
Security and Defence Policy, [represented the **apex** of security
cooperation among European Union member states and]{.underline} the EU's
undertaking of a heavier defence role along with [NATO]{.underline}. The
CSDP seeks to exercise European military independence from NATO within
five areas: the self-assured security of the EU, a closer relationship
between eastern and western Europe, structural improvement in European
conflict management, cooperation between neighboring regions, and
pioneering global governance of conflicts. To implement these priorities
into pre-existing European structural mechanisms, the EU's
civilian-military status has undergone an updating process. For
instance, the European External Action Service (EEAS) was created
through the Lisbon Treaty, signed in 2007, which made the EU
constitutional laws legally binding and further centralized the Union.
The Lisbon Treaty also sought to address the independent methods in
which the EU member states were answering international crises. When
EEAS was launched in December 2010 as an EU department with the express
function of consolidating EU responses to international security issues
as an autonomous unit, it actualized CSDP's vision for a new European
crisis management strategy which technically compelled member states to
cooperate in situations of security threats, in or out of the EU.
Initiatives similar to EAAS make clear [what the EU lacks has **not**
been the **incentive** to incorporate an international security
dimension to its agenda, but the **technical practicality** to implement
decisions to that end in a unified manner]{.underline}. [**Although
common goals** had been set for NATO-EU cooperation through the Berlin
Plus Agreements]{.underline} in 2003 [before CSDP, creation of a unified
transatlantic defence and security policy between the two entities has
encountered **ample executive difficulties**]{.underline}. For instance,
[Cyprus -- an EU but not NATO member- was excluded from joint EU-NATO
meetings by Turkey -- a NATO but not EU member- due to the decades long
political antagonism over the Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus in
1974]{.underline}. [Even this]{.underline} **[seemingly
inconsequential]{.underline}** [bilateral problem was enough to
\[halt\]]{.underline}~~paralyze~~ the [NATO-EU cooperation]{.underline},
[making some organizational details]{.underline} of Berlin Plus
Agreement **[impossible]{.underline}**. Berlin Agreement's [decision to
create a merged NATO-EU headquarters in Brussels to manage conflicts in
which both the EU and NATO have common interests has **not helped**
reduce the fracture between American and European politics]{.underline}.
For instance, when France and Germany coordinated a joint gathering with
Belgium and Luxembourg to protest the British-American invasion of
Saddam Hussein's Iraq, NATO and then American government denounced it as
"Chocolate Summit," betraying the spirit of cooperation aimed by CSDP.
Joint NATO-EU missions for stabilization in Bosnia and Herzegovina in
2004, in Dafur, Sudan, as an assistance to African Union or in Somali to
combat piracy are, however, some successful products of Berlin Plus
Agreements. These joint undertakings are cases in which not all the EU
or NATO members were interested in intervention, but they were made
possible by sharing of military expertise and assets from either of the
parties, mostly by NATO. However, post-colonial Africa and Western
Balkans are regions over which NATO and EU do not have strong strategic
disagreements. [Despite Berlin Plus, EU has been **critical** of NATO's
call for joint missions in Afghanistan for instance and only supported
the civilian projects of current Resolute Support Mission of
NATO.]{.underline} Bilateral hurdles in front of NATO-EU cooperation
such as Cyprus Dispute are hence not the actual root causes hindering
the constructive attitude of Berlin Plus. As Europe's disapproval of
Iraqi invasion or reluctance of cooperation in Afghanistan demonstrates,
[the CSDP cannot overcome the]{.underline} **[strategic
divergence]{.underline}** [of NATO and EU in issues of incompatible
political interests]{.underline}. **[Ideological
divergence]{.underline}** of the two partners [should be reconciled
before]{.underline} the region specific problems are addressed by calls
for [joint military actions]{.underline}. The new and more
NATO-conscious level of ambition for CSDP thus required European member
states to invest more in security and defence, both politically and
economic. Perhaps an important undertaking was revisiting Berlin Plus
Agreement's comfort in EU utilizing NATO asset and capabilities when
necessary, instead initiating more EU-focused solutions like EAAS. [With
the attenuation of this cooperative ethos in both sides, there is a
present risk that NATO and the EU will begin to **compete** for limited
military resources]{.underline}, straying from the envisioned Berlin
Plus Agreement. [Lack of a coherent strategy among Western partners
could **prevent efficient response to crises**, which does not bode well
in a time of humanitarian atrocities]{.underline} --- whether it be in
Syria, Yemen, or South Sudan.

In spite of the promising start that created a solid framework for
cooperation, [by the early 2010s the EU-NATO relationship had produced
very limited tangible results and was mired in structural
obstacles]{.underline}. [The main impediments]{.underline}, especially
at the operational level, [were created by]{.underline} the standoff
between Cyprus and Turkey over [the unresolved conflict on
Cyprus.]{.underline} [Furthermore, there was a tendency on both sides to
see the relationship between NATO and the CSDP in terms of competition
--]{.underline} even as a zero-sum game -- which obviously did not
encourage cooperation.21 [Since its accession to the EU in 2004, Cyprus
has put brakes on Turkey's accession negotiations and blocked its
participation in EUled missions,]{.underline} membership of the EDA
[and]{.underline} generally [a more active role in CSDP.]{.underline}
[At the same time, Turkey has been able to block the use of NATO
capabilities and assets by the EU and has not allowed the participation
of the Republic of Cyprus, which it does not recognise, at formal
EU-NATO meetings.]{.underline} [Hence, meetings between the North
Atlantic Council and the PSC have been held rarely]{.underline} (the
latest took place in September 2015) [and with a narrow
agenda.]{.underline}22 [This deadlock practically turned the Berlin Plus
arrangements into a dead letter]{.underline} and 21. Drozdiak 2010. It
should also be said that the Americans were not at that point
particularly helpful. 22. In the 18 months to August 2015, four PSC-NAC
meetings were organised: one formal meeting on EUFOR Operation Althea,
two informal meetings on Ukraine, and one informal meeting on the
eastern and southern neighbourhoods. See Dakic 2015. prevented more
ambitious strategic cooperation. Berlin Plus arrangements have been used
only for two operations: Operation Concordia in the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), which ended in September 2003, and EUFOR
Operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina, an operation deployed since
2004. While formal cooperation was limited, in practice a division of
labour in crisis management took shape, roughly along the lines of
soft/civilian and hard/military security. [Although the CSDP was created
to carry out both civilian and military crisis management tasks, the EU
did not become the preferred instrument for more ambitious military
operations. Member states limited the use of CSDP to softer, non-combat
operations, whereas NATO took care of militarily more demanding
environments and combat tasks. This division was evident in the two
locations where both organisations had an operation running
simultaneously: Kosovo and Afghanistan]{.underline}. Staff-level
cooperation between the missions on the ground worked reasonably well,
thanks to individual efforts to find flexible and creative ways to work
around the formal obstacles.23 [It was also a setback to the CSDP that
EU Battlegroups were never deployed due to the lack of political will to
actually use this new tool. One of the hurdles was the reluctance of
member states to finance their deploymen]{.underline}t. As of today,
discussions on improved usability and more effective financing of the
Battlegroups continue, but the issue has been pushed down the list of
priorities by new, more promising areas of defence cooperation, to be
described below. [Apart from the structural hurdles, the EU side was
simply not very interested in close cooperation. The EU nurtured an
ambition to be a different kind of international actor, described as a
civilian, normative, ethical or soft power.24 This aspiration favoured
taking a step back from NATO, characterised by many as a relic of the
Cold War that was struggling to find a new purpose.25]{.underline}

The Biden administration also provides a window of opportunity to
progress and be ambitious in broadening and regularizing NATO-EU
cooperation in the field of innovation and EDTs. While political
dialogue among their leadership has been steadily increasing over the
past five years, the [EU and NATO have consulted on their respective
EDTs agendas only twice]{.underline}. Furthermore, **[bureaucratic
procedures]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[misalignments]{.underline}** sometimes [frustrate even staff-to-staff
cooperation in this area]{.underline}. The [EU and increasingly NATO are
proliferating agencies that conduct work on innovation in EDTs,
including in security and defense]{.underline}. [This makes it
**challenging** to achieve **internal coherence** of activities within
one organization, let alone **coordinating agendas** between the
two.]{.underline}

[You might argue that it can only be a good thing if the Europeans step
up their defence arrangements]{.underline}. But this has little to do
with increasing military muscle. **[It is not the answer]{.underline}**
to the plea by successive US presidents for the Europeans to do more on
defence. [NATO is well established, well proven and
credible.]{.underline} 27 of its 30 member countries are European,
including 21 that also happen to be EU countries. So [why create another
structure?]{.underline} [Any EU force would have to draw on the **same
limited military resources**]{.underline} [and would be a
**duplicative**, **divisive** **distraction**]{.underline}. [EU
ambitions already intrude into NATO where coordination structures
between the two organisations have now been set up]{.underline}, in
spite of the fact that their membership is largely the same. [The EU
wants to become the European leg of NATO -- so where would that leave
key non-EU European members of NATO such as the UK, Norway and
Turkey]{.underline}? In any case, **[the EU countries can't even agree
among themselves]{.underline}**. Many pay lip service to the idea of
CSDP while refusing to participate in any meaningful way. Even the
arch-federalist European Parliament, in its most recent report on EU
defence, noted that "in over 15 years of existence EU battlegroups have
never been used, in particular due to the lack of political consensus
among Member States and the complexity of implementation and funding..."
At NATO HQ in the early '90s, the French were already pushing for
European military capabilities separate from NATO. [When the Bosnian
crisis began they demanded that the matter should be discussed not at
NATO but 'in another place']{.underline} -- by which they meant the
Western European Union (WEU), [a purely European group whose
headquarters was just down the road in central Brussels. As a
consequence, nonsensically, two allied navies operated in the Adriatic
and Mediterranean, one under NATO command and the other under
WEU]{.underline}, with more or less the same ships rotating between the
two. Once the Bosnian military operations got more serious, even France
gave up on this farce and backed the NATO option.

Yet [NATO-EU cooperation remains]{.underline} somewhat
**[limited]{.underline}** [because of **political tensions** between
member states]{.underline} ([which hinders intelligence
sharing]{.underline}) [as well as]{.underline} **[weak]{.underline}**
[European]{.underline} **[military capabilities]{.underline}** [and
inadequate defense spending]{.underline}. Over the past few years the EU
has made important progress in this domain through the establishment of
the European Defense Fund and several defense projects under the
Permanent Structure Cooperation (PESCO) mechanism. Yet, [according to
several studies]{.underline} in the field, [the state of European
defense appears insufficient to tackle more serious military threats or
to enable the EU to take initiatives in its neighborhood
**independently** from the United States]{.underline}. In its "Strategic
Compass" to be published in March 2022, the EU is supposed to adopt a
bolder approach to its defense capabilities. In parallel, in a new
strategic concept to be released in June 2022, NATO is supposed to
tackle security throughout a widened angle, looking at domains that are
not strictly defense-related.

The European Union's Juncker 26 Commission (2014-2019) actively avoided
regulating AI, causing the European Parliament to increase their efforts
as a proactive voice in favor of stronger AI regulation. However, since
the beginning of Ursula von der Leyen's tenure, the Commission has
initiated efforts to adopt stronger regulation for AI applications
(i.e., differentiating regulation of AI based on defined "high-risk" and
"low-risk" sectors") and associated data spaces.27,28 These legislative
proposals and their associated discussions are planned to be completed
by the end of 2020. During the strategic planning and budgeting process
of its R&D programs, the EU committed to providing at least EUR10.7
billion29 for AI-related research conducted between 2021 and 2027.30
**[Despite]{.underline}** [these financial and political efforts, the EU
still]{.underline} **[remains technologically dependent]{.underline}**
[on the US and China and suffers from a **lack of capital and private
funding**, **decentralized and uncoordinated AI expertise**, severe
**brain drain** (including **to the US**), and **slow adoption** of AI
programming in its education and public sectors.]{.underline}

Before proceeding, [it is]{.underline} **[worth spelling
out]{.underline}** [the extent to which European security is
dependent]{.underline} on NATO and [in particular on the
US]{.underline}. Of the EU's 27 member states, 21 are members of NATO.
These countries account for about 93% of the population1 of the EU.
[Within NATO]{.underline}, those [Allies that are also EU members only
account for about **20%** of total defence expenditure across the
Alliance, while the US alone accounts for about **70%** of the same
total]{.underline}.2 Beyond these aggregate indicators, [it is
furthermore the case that the US is **considerably ahead** of the EU in
terms of practical adoption of AI]{.underline}. For illustration, [in
2020 US private-sector investment in AI was around \$23.6 billion, but
was only \$2 billion in the EU, implying a ratio of **12 to 1** in
favour of the US]{.underline} (Zhang et al. 2021, 96). Scientific output
indicators offer a more nuanced picture. [In]{.underline} 2019, the EU
accounted for 16.4% of the world's [peer-reviewed AI
publications]{.underline}, ahead of the US with 14.6%, while China
occupied the top spot with 22.4% (Zhang et al. 2021, 20). On the other
hand, if one measures research output [in terms of publications on the
Arxiv database, the US is ahead of the EU]{.underline} (Zhang et al.
2021, 33) [by a ratio of almost two to one]{.underline}, which is
[nonetheless much less than the large gap in private
investment]{.underline} mentioned above. That [the EU
performs]{.underline} similarly to the US in terms of scientific
research, but [far less well in terms of investment and
commercialisation of new digital technologies,]{.underline} is [an **old
problem** which has proven **very difficult to address**, whether at
national or EU level]{.underline} (Baroudy et al. 2020).

### No Cyber Solvency

#### The EU will seek commercial advantages on AI which undermines broader cooperation.

The [EU's effort to strengthen ethical AI, and]{.underline} to [make
'trustworthy AI' a unique selling point for Europe, might]{.underline}
also [end up **creating problems** for transatlantic
cooperation]{.underline}. Many [EU policymakers believe]{.underline}
that [the EU's insistence on ethical AI will]{.underline} eventually
[become a **location advantage** for Europe]{.underline} (much like data
privacy)[:]{.underline} [as more people become concerned about unethical
AI and data security, they will prefer to use or buy AI 'made in Europe'
rather than elsewhere]{.underline}. In this respect, [two European aims
are **at odds** with each other]{.underline}: [on]{.underline} the [one
hand, Europeans want to ensure that AI is developed and used in an
ethical way]{.underline}. Partnering with a powerful player such as the
US on this matter should be an obvious way to help them achieve this
goal. [However, if the EU considers ethical AI not just a goal for
humanity but a development that may also create **commercial
advantages** for Europe, then **transatlantic cooperation** on this
issue is **counterproductive**, as it would undermine Europe's
uniqueness.]{.underline}

[In addition to]{.underline} these [overarching EU initiatives, a number
of separate bi- and multi-lateral groupings and frameworks have also
emerged in the last 10 to 15 years, aiming to unite like-minded nations
in pursuit of greater defence integration.]{.underline} This trend
further [confirms that EU member states and partners recognise that,
individually, their defence capabilities are insufficient to
independently deliver most, if not all, defence missions and that
collaboration and harmonisation are necessary]{.underline}. [Under the

### Agent CPs Bad

#### Agent CPs are a Voting Issue -- 

**a) Topic education -- agency debates are not grounded in the
resolution -- kills debate about military presence.**

**b) Aff ground -- moots the 1AC and makes it impossible to garner
offense -- they open the floodgates for an infinite number of
unpredictable counterplans**

**c) Read the CP as a DA -- solves their offense**

### International Fiat Bad

#### International Fiat is a voting issue --

**\--Not an opportunity cost -- the judge is the US -- logical decision
making is the portable impact of debate**

**\--CP justifies infinite intrinsicness because it expands the ambit of
the judge -- means we get to permute their DAs**

**\--Fairness -- impossible to research every possible actor -- kills
clash. And pressure CPs and international DAs solve their offense**
