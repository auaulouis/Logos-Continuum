Policymakers and academics are attuned to the cyber risks to nuclear
command and control. [The practitioner community has largely focused on
U.S. vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them. Scholars, in turn, worry
about how [cyber operations could have unintended escalatory
consequences.]{.mark}]{.underline} But less attention has been paid to
another likely scenario: [[the use of cyber operations]{.mark} for
signaling purposes (operations with visible effects [that aim to convey
a message]{.mark} to another state) [in a nuclear context]{.mark}. The
[ambiguity of cyber operations]{.mark} can sometimes be useful for
signaling --- but the same ambiguity [can be dangerous during a nuclear
crisis.]{.mark}]{.underline} The problem is that civilian leaders in
particular, distinct from the military, are inclined to see cyber
attacks as effective signaling tools. [[Cyber operations could have
nuclear implications]{.mark}, especially [because modern nuclear command
and control systems]{.mark}, like those in Russia and the United States,
[are becoming increasingly dependent on digital
infrastructure]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nuclear command, control, and
communications systems, which include early warning, information
collection, and communications capabilities, alert decision-makers to
impending nuclear strikes and also enable leaders to control decisions
about nuclear use (or non-use). But their [digital dependencies are
[creating opportunities for exploitation using cyber
means]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a 2020 report, the Nuclear Threat
Initiative found that "almost 9 out of 10 planned nuclear modernization
programs involve at least some new digital components or upgrades."
Vulnerabilities inherent in the digital infrastructure that undergird
modern nuclear [[systems provide opportunities for actors to engage in
cyber espionage]{.underline}]{.mark} --- gaining access to a network or
system to steal information --- or even conduct cyber attacks.
Hypothetically, a cyber power like Russia could conduct a cyber attack
against a U.S. early warning satellite to degrade its functionality.
This has become an urgent concern for practitioners. U.S. Strategic
Command, for instance, is currently working to "operationally harden NC3
systems against cyber threats." Congress has also gotten involved,
requiring the Defense Department to evaluate the cybersecurity of major
weapon systems. And the Government Accountability Office has published
multiple reports decrying the state of cybersecurity and scope of
vulnerabilities of weapon systems, including elements of the nuclear
triad.

Yet it is not the much discussed theme of the economic damage inflicted
by cyber crime in the past year that has dominated the debate. It is
more the use of cyber as an instrument of state policy, political
influence, and manipulation. From [being a useful tool of espionage and
intellectual property theft, [cyber intrusions have evolved into a
potent instrument of hybrid warfare and outright political
vandalism.]{.mark} [Ukraine]{.mark}, for example, has been the victim of
an unprecedented and systematic campaign of cyber bullying. It [has
acknowledged up to 2,000 orchestrated cyberattacks since Russia occupied
Crimea in March 2014.]{.mark} It has suffered disruption to its election
voting system, train and airline on-line booking, ports, electricity
grid]{.underline}, and most recently, the massive elimination of tax and
financial accounting data through the NotPetya malware. Initially
disguised as a ransomware attack similar to the previous WannaCry, a
hack that affected more than 200,000 computer networks in 150 countries,
it soon became clear that the data encrypted was being destroyed, and
that the motive of the attack was not financial gain but rather economic
and structural sabotage. Although companies in other countries were also
affected by NotPetya, 80 percent of the impact was in Ukraine.1
Intelligence analysts now agree that NotPetya was a state-driven effort.
All of these orchestrated cyber campaigns suggest that Ukraine is being
used as a laboratory or proving ground to test a range of cyber weapons
and assess their impact, with widespread collateral damage elsewhere
accepted as a consequence of doing business; or even as a way to cover
tracks.2 Given [the difficulty of technical attribution and [the
inability of governments to deter or retaliate against cyberattacks in a
manner that demands the attacker's attention but avoids]{.mark} unwanted
[escalation]{.mark}, [NATO has]{.mark} had [to]{.mark} take a hard look
at its preparedness, not only to fend off cyberattacks but also to
[preserve its political and military freedom of navigation in the cyber
domain.]{.mark}]{.underline} The revelation in a recent Washington Post
article of how the Obama Administration rejected nearly all proposed
responses to Russian incursions into the communications of the
Democratic National Committee because they were deemed to be
ineffective, escalatory, or would compromise long-term U.S. intelligence
gathering and prematurely expose U.S. offensive cyber capabilities,
caught NATO's attention.3 [There is growing awareness that [Russian
operational activity]{.mark} built around groups such as APT28 is
[aim]{.mark}ed [at inflicting damage to the reputation and cohesiveness
of]{.mark} organizations such as [NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline}4
Consequently, reducing the strategic cyber threat to the functionality
of governments and societies and making cyberspace more stable and
transparent has become as important to international peace and order as
nuclear arms control or the conventional balance of power.

## Internal Link Extensions

### 2AC \-\-- Financial Collapse Internal Link

#### Cyber-attacks will cause the next financial crisis

**Mee and Schuermann 18** \[Paul Mee and Til Schuermann,a partner at

But [[the next crisis might]{.mark} not [come from]{.mark} a financial
shock at all]{.underline}. [The more likely culprit: [a cyber
attack]{.mark} that causes disruptions to financial
services]{.underline} capabilities, especially payments systems, around
the world. [Criminals have always sought ways to infiltrate financial
technology systems]{.underline}. Now, [[the financial system faces
the]{.mark} added [risk of becoming collateral damage in a wider attack
on critical]{.mark} national [infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such
[[an attack could shake confidence in the]{.mark} global
[financial]{.mark} [services system, causing banks,]{.mark}]{.underline}
businesses and consumers [[to be stymied]{.mark}, confused [or panicked,
which in turn could have a]{.mark} major [negative impact on economic
activity]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[Cybercrime alone costs nations
more than **\$1 trillion** globally]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[far more
than the record **\$300 billion of damage due to natural disasters in
2017**]{.underline},]{.mark} according to a recent analysis our firm
performed. We ranked cyber attacks as the biggest threat facing the
business world today --- ahead of terrorism, asset bubbles, and other
risks. [An attack on a computer processing or communications network
could cause \$50 billion to \$120 billion of economic
damage]{.underline}, a loss ranking somewhere between those of
Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina, according to recent estimates. Yet a much
broader and more debilitating attack isn't farfetched. Just last month,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a warning to banks about a
pending large scale attack known as an ATM "cash-out" strike, in which
waves of synchronized fraudulent withdrawals drain bank accounts. In
July, meanwhile, it was revealed that hackers working for Russia had
easily penetrated the control rooms of US electric utilities and could
have caused blackouts. How might a financial crisis triggered by a cyber
attack unfold? [A likely scenario would be an attack by a rogue nation
or terrorist group on financial institutions or major
infrastructure]{.underline}. [Inside North Korea]{.underline}, for
example, [the Lazarus Group, also known as Hidden Cobra, routinely looks
for ways to compromise banks and exploit crypto currencies]{.underline}.
An attack on a bank, investment fund, custodian firm, ATM network, the
interbank messaging network known as SWIFT, or the Federal Reserve
itself would represent a direct hit on the financial services system.
[[A]{.mark}nother [possibility would be]{.mark} if a so-called
hacktivist or "script kiddy" amateur were to use malicious programs to
launch [a cyber attack]{.mark} without due consideration of the
consequences.]{.underline} [Such an attack [could have a chain reaction,
causing damage way beyond the original
intent]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} because rules, battle norms, and
principles that are conventional wisdom in most warfare situations but
don't exist in a meaningful way in the digital arena. For example, in
2016 a script kiddie sparked a broad denial-of-service attack impacting
Twitter, Spotify, and other well-known internet services as amateurs
joined in for mischief purposes. [Whether a major cyber attack is
deliberate or somewhat accidental, [the damage could be
substantial]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[Most of the **ATM networks
across North America could freeze**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Credit card
and other payment systems could fail across entire nations]{.mark}, as
happened to the VISA network in the UK in June]{.underline}. [[Online
banking could become inaccessible: no cash, no payments, no reliable
information about bank accounts]{.underline}]{.mark}. Banks could lose
the ability to transact with one another during a critical period of
uncertainty. There could be widespread panic, albeit temporary. Such an
outcome might not cause the sort of long-simmering financial crisis that
sparked the Great Recession, because money would likely be restored to
banks and payments providers once systems were back online. At the same
time, it isn't clear how a central bank, the traditional financial
crisis firefighter, could respond to this type of crisis on short
notice. [[After the problem is fixed and the crisis halted, a daunting
task of recovery would loom]{.underline}]{.mark}. It would be even more
difficult if data were corrupted, manipulated or rendered inaccessible.

### 2AC \-\-- Grids Vulnerability

#### The US' pipelines and electric grids are vulnerable to cyberattacks.

**Plumer 21** \[Brad, a reporter covering climate change, energy policy
and other environmental issues for The New York Times. Previously, he
was a senior editor at Vox.com and a reporter at the Washington Post.
"Pipeline Hack Points to Growing Cybersecurity Risk for Energy System",
08 June 2021, The New York Times,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/climate/pipeline-ransomware-hack-energy-grid.html>
\] -ALP

Despite years of warnings[, [America's]{.mark} vast [network of
pipelines, electric grids and power plants remains]{.mark} **acutely
[vulnerable to cyberattacks]{.mark}** with the potential to [disrupt
energy]{.mark} supplies [for millions]{.mark} of people]{.underline}.
Dealing with those risks, analysts said, will pose a major challenge for
the Biden administration as it seeks hundreds of billions of dollars to
modernize the nation's energy infrastructure and transition to cleaner
sources of energy to address climate change. Regulators are increasingly
poised to step in. On Monday, Richard Glick, the chairman of the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, said [[it]{.mark} wa[s]{.mark} [**time to
establish mandatory cybersecurity standards** for the nation's]{.mark}
nearly [3 million miles of oil and gas pipelines,]{.mark} similar to
those currently found in the electricity sector.]{.underline} "Simply
encouraging pipelines to voluntarily adopt best practices is an
inadequate [[response to the ever-increasing number and sophistication
of]{.mark} malevolent [cyber actors]{.mark}]{.underline}," Mr. Glick
said in a statement. The risks to the nation's energy systems are
widespread and varied. Many oil and gas pipelines, for instance, rely on
decades-old control systems that are not well defended against more
sophisticated cyberattacks and can't be easily updated. And it's not
just pipelines. [As [electric grid operators harness]{.mark} a growing
array of [digital technologies]{.mark} to help manage the flow of power
and cut planet-warming emissions --- [such as smart thermostats,
or]{.mark} far-flung yet [interconnected networks of solar
arrays]{.mark} --- [hackers]{.mark} may [find new entry points]{.mark}
to exploit.]{.underline} The shutdown on Friday of the Colonial
Pipeline, which stretches 5,500 miles from Texas to New Jersey and
transports 45 percent of the East Coast's fuel supplies, illustrates how
devastating such attacks can be. On Saturday, Colonial acknowledged that
its corporate computer systems had been hit by a ransomware attack, in
which criminal groups hold data hostage until the victim pays a ransom.
The company said that it had shut down the pipeline as a precaution,
apparently for fear that the hackers might have obtained information
that would enable them to attack parts of the pipeline itself. Colonial
said on Wednesday that it had started to resume pipeline operations,
though it would take several days to restore full service. But
throughout the Southeast, panicked Americans were racing to stock up on
gasoline, causing thousands of gas stations to run out of fuel. While
Colonial has yet to explain exactly what triggered the pipeline
shutdown, experts said there were plenty of vulnerabilities lurking
throughout America's energy infrastructure. [Last year, [the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency reported a ransomware
attack]{.mark} on a natural gas compression facility [that caused a
shutdown of the facility for two days. In 2018, several]{.mark} natural
gas [pipeline operators]{.mark} reported that [a system that processes
customer transactions had been attacked, leading to service
disruptions]{.mark}. But bigger risks lurk: [In 2016, hackers knocked
out large sections of the power grid in Ukraine, which was thought to be
**the first intentional blackout triggered by a cyberattack**. At the
time]{.mark}, the Obama administration warned that America's electric
utilities were not immune to similar attacks. In the past, [energy
companies]{.mark} typically [kept]{.mark} the [operational systems that
run pipelines or power plants disconnected]{.mark}, or "air gapped,"
[from the]{.mark} broader [internet, which meant]{.mark} that [hackers
could not easily gain access to]{.mark} the most [critical
infrastructure]{.mark}. [But]{.mark} increasingly [that's no longer the
case, as companies install more]{.mark} sophisticated monitoring and
diagnostics [software]{.mark} that help them operate these systems more
efficiently.]{.underline} That potentially creates new cybersecurity
risks. "Now these systems are all [interconnected in ways that the
companies themselves don't always fully understand,"]{.underline} said
Marty Edwards, vice president of operational technology for Tenable, a
cybersecurity firm. "That provides an opportunity for attacks in one
area to propagate elsewhere." Many industrial control systems were
[[installed decades ago and run on outdated software, which means that
even finding programmers to upgrade the systems can be a
challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}. And the operators of vital energy
infrastructure --- such as pipelines, refineries or power plants --- are
often reluctant to shut down the flow of fuel or power for extended
periods of time to install frequent security patches. Making things
harder still, analysts said, many companies do not always have a [good
sense of exactly when and where it's worthwhile to spend money on costly
new cybersecurity defense]{.underline}s, in part because of a lack of
readily available data on which types of risks they are most likely to
face. "Companies don't always release a lot of information publicly"
about the threats they're seeing, said Padraic O'Reilly, a co-founder of
CyberSaint Security, who works with pipelines and critical
infrastructure on cybersecurity. "That can make it hard as an industry
to know where to invest." Analysts said that the nation's electric
utilities and grid operators were typically further ahead in preparing
for cyberattacks than the oil and gas industry, in part because federal
regulators have long required cybersecurity standards for the backbone
of the nation's power grid. Still, vulnerabilities remain. "Part of it
is the [sheer complexity of the grid,"]{.underline} said Reid Sawyer,
managing director of the United States cyberconsulting practice at
Marsh, an insurance firm. [Not all levels of the grid face mandatory
standards, for instance, and [there are more than 3,000 utilities in the
country with varying cybersecurity practices.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Just as many military experts predicted that a Russian invasion of
Ukraine would be quick and decisive[, so [many]{.mark} cyber-experts
[expected that Moscow would fortify its]{.mark} conventional [onslaught
with a devastating cyberattack]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Ukrainian forces
would be blinded, critical infrastructure broken, and Russian
disinformation rampant]{.underline}. But just as the military experts
have been surprised by Russia's stalled invasion, so have the
cyber-experts by the lack of major digital attacks. In the first few
days of conflict, cyber-operations seem to be more fizzle than bang.
Some Russian cyber-activity has been discovered, but it seems to have
done little to invigorate the Russian military campaign or hinder the
Ukrainian response. In the run-up to the invasion, Russia launched wiper
malware attacks, which deleted data from computers at Ukrainian
government agencies. [[Russia]{.mark} also [appears to have conducted
some]{.mark} distributed [denial-of-service attacks]{.mark},
[which]{.mark} bombarded [websites]{.mark} with so much information they
became [paralyzed]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} a series of [cybernetwork
exploitation]{.mark} [attempts on Ukrainian]{.mark} government and
[military systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[But Ukrainian air
defense]{.mark} and aircraft [didn't]{.mark} [appear]{.mark} [to be
affected]{.mark} by cyber-disruptions, [and]{.mark} [there are no
reports of]{.mark} critical infrastructure [damage]{.mark} from
cyberattacks]{.underline}. Even the Internet seems to be up and running
in Ukraine. Why the apparent restraint? [It is almost impossible to know
exactly why (or if) the Russians have indeed held back]{.underline}.
Perhaps cyber-operations have been attempted and failed; perhaps Russian
President Vladimir Putin has held his cyber-capabilities in reserve,
saving them for later. Or maybe cyber-operations have taken place, but
their effect---which is often virtual and not clearly attributed---will
take longer to materialize. What is known is that the conflict is far
from over, and [[the next question becomes whether cyber-operations
could play a larger role as the war turns more
violent]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is likely that the next stage of
conflict will more than ever be defined by planes, tanks, artillery, and
soldiers. [It seems unlikely, given the amount of indiscriminate damage
currently being inflicted by Russia, that cyber-operations will escalate
the violence of the campaign within Ukraine]{.underline}. [That said,
[could cyber-operations lead to horizontal escalation, drawing NATO into
the fight]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example? Or, given that the United
States and Russia are the world's largest nuclear powers,
[[could]{.mark} cyber-operations [escalate to]{.mark} the worst possible
outcome---[nuclear war]{.mark}? Recent wargaming research suggests that
[cyber-exploits]{.mark} into nuclear command and control may be
[entic]{.mark}ing [for states looking to neutralize a nuclear escalation
threat in the midst of a conventional war,]{.mark} and that actors may
underestimate the danger of these exploits and vulnerabilities to
nuclear stability.]{.underline}

### 2AC \-\-- Impact Extension \-\-- Democratic Backsliding

#### Democratic backsliding undermines law

**Wolkenstein 20**\[Fabio Wolkenstein is an Assistant Professor of
\"Transformations of Democracy\" at the University of Vienna. I work on
democratic theory, political parties, representation, ideologies, and

SL

This leads to another question that must be clarified before moving on:
why is democratic backsliding a form of wrongdoing? I have so far just
postulated that [democratic backsliding is a 'wrong,']{.underline} and
relied on readers' intuitive agreement with this conjecture. But why
exactly is it a wrong? [The most straightforward answer, I suggest, is
that [Hungary and Poland violate their duty to obey EU law when they
undermine democracy and the rule of law.]{.mark} That duty arises
because both states have democratically ratified the EU treaties,
thereby having accepted the treaties as (1) a framework for dealing with
a specified range of issues and a source of normative demands on
national institutional configurations.]{.underline}8 Of course, this is
not the only answer that could be given to this question. It is probably
possible to mount a more general case against democratic backsliding
that shows that [[governments who undermine democracy and the rule of
law engage in wrongdoing irrespective of which treaties they may have
signed.]{.mark} This could be achieved by invoking a moral requirement
that states ought to secure citizens' public and private autonomy
through well-functioning democratic and legal
institutions.]{.underline}9 But though I am sympathetic to this line of
reasoning, I simply lack the space to develop such an argument here. The
more 'legalistic' (and possibly less controversial) argument from
treaty-based obligations suffices for our purposes.

#### Democratic Sliding means authoritarianism

[By [democratic backsliding, political analysts generally mean that a
democracy is]{.mark} [slipping backwards in terms]{.mark} of its
democratic [performance,]{.mark} [and that there are **signs of rising
authoritarianism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. One succinct definition holds
that democratic backsliding involves "state-led debilitation or
elimination of any of the political institutions that sustain an
existing democracy." Democratic backsliding differs from more
generalized democratic erosion in terms of both intent and focus.
International IDEA's research in this area has highlighted the linkage
between democratic backsliding and actions that specifically damage both
horizontal constraints (via attacks on the legislature and the courts)
and accountability to the voting public (via interference with media
integrity and civil liberties). In most cases of democratic backsliding,
the ability to hold free and fair elections is not immediately impacted
-- though this may come later. Applying the implications of this
research in a diagnostic way, International IDEA tracks the average
value of its indicators for Checks on Government and Civil Liberties for
every country, and where we see a decline compared to five years ago
that is greater than the threshold we've defined, we classify that
country as backsliding. That also means that each country is compared to
itself, not to some abstract and universal standard.

### 2AC \-\-- Impact Extension \-\-- Populism

#### Populists use nuclear weapons irresponsibly

**Meier and Vieluf 21** \[Oliver Meier is a senior Researcher at the
Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy. Prior to this, he was
Deputy Head in the International Security Division of the German
Institute for International and Security Affairs. Maren Vieluf is a

populism increases nuclear dangers\", The Nonproliferation Review,
https://doi.org/10.1080/10736700.2020.1864932\] SL

[Nationalist populists, by contrast, often speak loosely about nuclear
weapons,]{.underline} which complicates a "reading" of their
statements.52 This concerns both style and substance, which coincide
with their personalistic style of leadership53 and their desire to flout
the rules of what they deride as "political correctness."54 Donald Trump
has again led the way---for example, through his excessive tweeting on
nuclear-weapon issues.55 Other [[nationalist populists]{.mark} have also
deviated from previous rhetorical styles by [brag]{.mark}ging [about
their nuclear weapons.]{.mark} In April 2019, shortly [after an
escalation]{.mark} of the Pulwama crisis [between India and
Pakistan]{.mark} had been averted, Indian Prime Minister Narendra [Modi
suggested that his country]{.mark} was ready to use [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapons against [Pakistan]{.mark}]{.underline}: "Every other day they
used to say 'we have nuclear button, we have nuclear button'. What do we
have then? Have we kept it for Diwali?"56 President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan's October 2019 statement that it is unacceptable for Turkey not
to have nuclear weapons because "\[t\]here is no developed nation in the
world that doesn't have them"57 is another typically populist statement,
conflating strong views with half-truths or lies. Such loose talk may
have several purposes. By emphasizing nuclear weapons, nationalist
populists can set themselves apart from the established elite discourse.
Donald Trump boasted of having gained knowledge of nuclear weapons not
through a formal education but through his uncle, a professor of
engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.58 Thus, the US
president believed that he did not need to rely on the expertise and
experience of the nuclear elite. [This ignorance of nuclear lessons by
virtue of not "being socialized to the dangers of nuclear weapons"59
derived from the past is a trademark of nationalist populists, but is
also part and parcel of a general loss of expertise in executives and
parliaments in nuclear-weapon states and nuclear-allied countries.60
Nationalist [populists also like to make strong statements on nuclear
issues because they]{.mark} may [believe that this impresses their main
target audience]{.mark}---that is, [their domestic power
base]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, [[Putin has several times used his
regular direct encounters with the Russian public to highlight the
importance of nuclear weapons for Moscow's standing]{.mark} in the
world.]{.underline} In March 2018, Putin, in his speech to the Federal
Assembly of Parliamentarians, policy makers, religious leaders, public
figures, and members of the media, boasted about Russia's nuclear
capabilities and in true populist fashion even invited "\[t\]hose
interested in military equipment ... to suggest a name for this new
weaponry, this cutting-edge" nuclear-weapon system.

#### Populism accelerates climate change

**Leigh 21** \[Andrew Leigh, Member of Australian Parliament, November
5, 2021, "How Populism Imperils the Planet", *THE MIT PRESS READER*,
ttps://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/how-populism-imperils-the-planet/\]-Hayer

Yet focusing on catastrophic risk --- in climate change and other areas
--- is hampered by the growth of populist politics. Not every populist
is a climate denier, but virtually all climate deniers are populists.
[One analysis of the 21 largest right-wing populist parties in Europe
found that one-third were outright climate deniers, while many others
were hostile to climate action.]{.underline} Right-wing populists make
up 15 percent of the European Parliament, but their votes account for
around half of all those voting against climate and energy resolutions.
A recent study in the United Kingdom identified voters who held populist
beliefs about politics[. These [populist voters were significantly less
likely to agree that global warming is caused by human action and less
likely to support measures to protect the
environment.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Populism is on the rise]{.mark}.
From 1990 to 2018, [the number of countries with populist leaders
increased from four to 20]{.mark}]{.underline}. The best known was
[[President Donald Trump,]{.mark} who [once claimed that climate change
is a "hoax,"]{.mark}]{.underline} and asserted that "global warming was
created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing
non-competitive." In the current Congress, 52 percent of House
Republicans and 60 percent of Senate Republicans are climate deniers.
[[In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro]{.mark} has loosened controls over
land clearing in the Amazon. This [has led farmers to accelerate
deforestation by logging and burning]{.mark}. In [mid-2019, satellite
analysis of major fires in the Amazon showed that an area the size of
Yellowstone National Park had been burned]{.mark}]{.underline}. At this
pace, this additional deforestation could push the Amazon rainforest
toward a tipping point.

#### European populism will increase nuclear risk.

**Gevarter '18** \[David, an intern for European studies at the Council

-ALP

[As part of NATO's shared nuclear deterrent, [the United States
currently deploys the B61 gravity bomb in five NATO countries: Belgium,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey]{.mark}.]{.underline} While
nuclear weapons are not popular among the European public, technocrats
in European governments have recognized that [[the]{.mark} NATO [nuclear
deterrent is an unpleasant but strategic
imperative]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [[the rise of populist]{.mark}
and nationalist movements acros[s Europe could]{.mark} damage this
consensus and [threaten]{.mark} the integrity of [NATO's nuclear
mission]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The Trump administration believes
that the United States must deploy more tactical (non-strategic) weapons
in Europe through NATO to signal to Russia that any use of tactical
weapons would be met by an equivalent response[. [The 2018 U.S. Nuclear
Posture Review claims that **Russia is more likely to use**
]{.mark}**tactical [nuclear weapons]{.mark} in a [first strike]{.mark}
to gain advantage [because it believes the United States would not
escalate]{.mark} with a strategic nuclear strike**. As such[, the Trump
administration has placed great importance on expanding the United
States' arsenal]{.mark} of tactical nuclear weapons---such as the
B61---[as a way of countering]{.mark} the perceived [Russia]{.mark}n
advantage in this field[. Yet, this strategy could encounter serious
obstacles as populist governments gain a foothold]{.mark}]{.underline}
on the continent, exacerbated by growing anti-American sentiment. As the
wave of populist governments gains popularity in Europe, instead of
upholding long-standing NATO commitments, [these governments might cave
to the will of the masses.]{.underline} They could order the withdrawal
of NATO---namely, U.S.---nuclear weapons from their territory,
disregarding strategic necessity. The surge of populism in Germany, the
backbone of the European project, can do the most damage to the shared
nuclear deterrent. [The current German government has thus far
maintained the nuclear status quo despite opposition, but Angela
Merkel's hold on power is not what it used to be. Recent [figures show
that 71 percent of Germans favor banning nuclear weapons, and a change
in Germany's executive government could put NATO interests at risk.
In]{.mark} the [2017]{.mark} federal election, **[Merkel's political
alliance lost]{.mark} a significant percentage of its [seats]{.mark} in
the Bundestag, most notably [to the populist, right-wing party
Alternative for Deutschland (AfD).]{.mark}** In its platform, AfD
explicitly calls for the withdrawal of all NATO troops and nuclear
weapons from German territory.]{.underline} With the near collapse of
the current German government over immigration, the possibility of a
rise to power by AfD or a party with similar views is no longer
far-fetched. Like in Germany[, the specter of [populism has become very
real in Italy, with the anti-establishment coalition formed by the
League and 5-Star parties]{.mark} taking power. [This]{.mark} [could
spell trouble for the NATO shared deterrent, given the]{.mark} broad
[unpopularity of nuclear weapons]{.mark} in the country. According to a
2007 survey, 70 percent of Italian respondents indicated that the use of
NATO nuclear weapons would never be justified, [even in the context of
war]{.mark}. Over half of respondents indicated that they believed NATO
nuclear-sharing agreements violate the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty
and that Italy should not be party to such agreements. Maintaining and
expanding the U.S. nuclear arsenal in Italy will require significant
cooperation from the Italian government, but [Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte]{.mark}\'s government [has shown little intention to]{.mark}
acquiesce to President Trump\'s demands for NATO, such as [increasing
defense spending]{.mark}.]{.underline} It appears that the
new, pro-Russia government in Italy is willing to do whatever it
takes to appeal to public opinion, irrespective of the ramifications.
[[Russia has always wanted the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons from
Europe and such a move could be]{.mark} part of **[an Italian strategy
of warming relations with the Kremlin]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The 2016
attempted military coup showed that [[Turkey is the most unstable NATO
country,]{.underline}]{.mark} where the future of nuclear sharing is, at
best, unsure. Since the attempted coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's
populist government has further undermined Turkey's relationship with
the United States, NATO, and other Western countries as the country
secures diplomatic and military rapprochement with Moscow. Erdogan
has leveraged populist rhetoric to consolidate power, galvanizing
support for his agenda and eroding checks and balances on his rule.
Erdogan himself is no fan of nuclear weapons, [[and it is easy to
imagine a scenario in which, as part of a pivot toward
Moscow, Erdogan orders NATO nuclear weapons out of
Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even if that is not the case, many experts
argue that the United States should withdraw its nuclear weapons from
Turkey, given the deteriorating political climate in the country[.
[This, given the country's proximity to Russia and]{.mark} other areas
of interest in [the Middle East, could jeopardize NATO's ability to
hold]{.mark} enemy [targets at risk with its nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}.]{.underline} The uncertainty throughout NATO countries
prompts questions regarding the future of the shared nuclear deterrent.
If U.S. tactical nuclear weapons are withdrawn from Turkey or elsewhere
in Europe, where else could they go? Some have suggested Poland, given
the country's desire for an increased NATO presence, but this
[[unprecedented expansion of the nuclear deterrent to Eastern Europe
could---and likely would---spark a dramatic showdown with
Russia,]{.mark} turning the Polish border with Kaliningrad into a hot
zone. [The]{.mark} worsening [wave of populism in Europe could give
impetus to]{.mark} European popular [opposition to nuclear weapons,
forcing]{.mark} their [withdrawal]{.mark} from the continent. **[If the
Pentagon]{.mark} truly [wants to]{.mark} adhere to its designs to
[expand its arsenal]{.mark} of tactical nuclear weapons [deployed in
Europe as part of the NATO]{.mark} shared [nuclear deterrent, it needs
to start coming up with contingency plans]{.mark}**.]{.underline} At the
very least, President Trump should stop antagonizing NATO allies and try
to preserve what little good will remains toward the U.S. agenda.

The next key term, alliance cohesion, reflects the degree to which the
members are able to agree on goals, strategies, and tactics, and
coordinate activity for attaining those goals.7 In addition to this
behavioral component, [[cohesion represents the]{.mark} particular
[quality that makes its members operate as a whole during times of
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. Literature from the psychology field
defines cohesion as "bonds, either social or task based, that contribute
to the synergistic functioning as a whole."8 Other accounts claim
"[[alliance cohesion is based upon]{.mark} the distance between
individual member interests and [the collective alliance
interest]{.mark}]{.underline}."9 In defining this term, it is key to
note that cohesion is a very fluid idea, contextually based and highly
subjective. Therefore, this research proceeded under the assumption that
cohesion is largely qualitative in nature. [Some assert that [the best
moment to understand cohesion is in time of crisis]{.mark}, such as when
the Alliance faces a significant conflict. [In]{.mark} case of [wartime
alliances, cohesion refers to the states' ability to coordinate military
strategy, agree on war aims, and avoid making a separate
peace]{.mark}]{.underline}, together with "the degree of convergence
among member states' commitments to the alliance."10 This is important,
since conventional wisdom asserts the source of cohesion is usually the
element (be it political, economic, military, or nonmaterial) that is
targeted by adversary activities and likely results in the defeat of the
attacked party. It then follows that by adhering to these definitions,
[one could consider Alliance cohesion to be at the level of a center of
gravity]{.underline}, since it "exerts a certain centripetal force that
tends to hold an entire ... structure together."

There are [two traditions regarding the relationship between conflict
and politics: realism and liberalism]{.underline}. "For the realist,
[[the central problem of international politics is war and the use of
force]{.mark}, and the central actors are states]{.underline}."52 [The
realist is pragmatic in that he expects that others will try to take
what he is unable to defend so he must demonstrate strength to ensure
his sovereignty.]{.underline} By maximizing one's own power, one
minimizes the ability of other states to threaten one's security.53 At a
certain point however, [the realist becomes strong enough that he begins
considering what he might be able to take from a weaker
neighbor]{.underline}. [[The "offensive realist]{.mark}" does not even
[think]{.mark} there is a choice; [the only way he can better his odds
of survival is to have more relative power than his potential
enemies]{.mark}]{.underline}, a gulf he can widen by physically reducing
his adversary's strength.54 Realists see the contemporary international
system as anarchic---there is no central or governing power- so [the
only things that enforce order are the individual states' ability and
willingness to fight to maintain the status quo.]{.underline}
Neo-liberalism envisions "a global society that functions alongside the
states and sets part of the context for the states."56 Liberalism
promotes the view not just of international governing bodies and legal
restraint, but also that interdependent trade, monetary systems, and
cross border communication have evolved into a transnational society
where conflict is less likely. This is the essence of globalization, and
is the preferred view of the world generally held in the West. [Realists
counter that there will always be a potential for a future state of war
and one had better be ready to protect against it. [Offensive
realism]{.mark} is not a popular concept in the liberal-minded West
because it tends to be at odds with our traditionally optimistic
values.]{.underline}57 [It [is the]{.mark} difference in [world]{.mark}
view of relation [power]{.mark} that explains why a country [like
Russia]{.mark} would suddenly seize Crimea, or why China would rapidly
expand in[to]{.mark} its neighbors' territorial waters.]{.underline} If
a state views the world through the realist lens, [specifically from the
position of offensive realism, that state's [act]{.mark}ions often
appear [irrational]{.mark} to liberal outsiders [as those actions
undermine the]{.mark} best interests of the [international
community]{.mark}.]{.underline} They appear much more pragmatic when
they are seen [to [increase]{.underline}]{.mark} [the relative
[power]{.mark}, and therefore the chances of survival, of the aggressor
state.]{.underline} While this realist perspective might be depressing,

With the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, many foreign policy
experts such as [Kenneth
Waltz](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/sipa/U6800/readings-sm/Waltz_Structural%20Realism.pdf),
[Michael
MccGwire](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&pdftype=1&fid=33532&jid=RIS&volumeId=24&issueId=01&aid=33531),
[Michael
Brown](http://www.tandfonline.com.mutex.gmu.edu/doi/abs/10.1080/00396339508442775?journalCode=tsur20),
and others warned against expanding the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) to former Soviet-aligned countries, arguing
expansion would [unnecessarily
provoke](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&pdftype=1&fid=33532&jid=RIS&volumeId=24&issueId=01&aid=33531)
the Russians to take steps inimical to America's interests. The events
of the post-Cold War era simply do not support this assertion. Rather[,
the historical evidence suggests Russian leaders act aggressively when
the cost-benefit-risk of aggression weighs heavily in Russia's favor---a
threshold past NATO expansions have never crossed.]{.underline}

In the intervening 20 years, **[Russia has protested NATO expansion but
never acted aggressively in response to expansion]{.underline}**. Russia
did respond militarily to events that threatened their interests, such
as the revolution in Ukraine and improving Ukraine-European Union
economic ties. In those cases, the benefits of military action dwarfed
the costs from the perspective of Russian leaders. Recent Russian
actions indicate U.S. and NATO will likely continue clashing with
Russia, regardless of changes to U.S. administrations, due to the
dramatically different values and assumptions held by Russian and NATO
leaders. NATO's defense reductions combined with perceptions the West
has few [red
lines](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/04/the-problem-with-obamas-account-of-the-syrian-red-line-incident/)
have helped foster an environment where Russia likely believes the costs
of aggression are low[**. To counter this perception, the United States
and NATO should continue and expand policies, like the** [European
Reassurance
Initiative](http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2016/FY2016_ERI_J-Book.pdf)**,
likely to increase the risks and costs associated with aggression from a
Russian perspective.**]{.underline}

[Russian aggression has resulted from a combination of many different
factors]{.underline} that created a situation where the benefits of
aggression significantly outweighed their costs. **[While Russians
certainly like using NATO expansion to justify aggression, this article
describes facts suggesting Russia's motives have little to do with fears
over NATO expansion or military forces.]{.underline}** We will first
explain U.S. and NATO efforts to strengthen and cooperate with Russia
based on the assumption Russia could be a partner. This Western
perception contributed to dramatic reductions in NATO's combat power in
Europe and prioritization of non-military spending.

Moscow's cruel overreaction deserves emphatic condemnation. However[,
[the culpability of the United States and its NATO allies also is
sizable. Moving an alliance]{.mark} that one great power dominates [to
the border of another major power is inherently destabilizing and
provocative.]{.mark}]{.underline} Those people who are familiar with
even the basics of international relations should grasp that point; it
was inexcusable that so many U.S. and NATO leaders apparently did not do
so. One can readily imagine how Americans would react if Russia, China,
India, or another peer competitor admitted countries from Central
America and the Caribbean to a security alliance that it led---and then
sought to add Canada as an official or de facto military ally. It is
highly probable that the United States would have responded by going to
war years ago. Yet [[even though Ukraine has an importance to
Russia]{.mark} comparable to Canada's importance to the United States,
[our leaders expected Moscow to respond passively]{.mark} to the growing
encroachment. [They have been proven **disastrously wrong**]{.mark}, and
thanks to their ineptitude, the world is now a far more dangerous
place.]{.underline}

[[Damage to]{.underline}]{.mark} US and [[NATO credibility]{.mark} over
the matter of Ukraine [can trace]{.mark} its history [at least as far
back as the 2008 Bucharest summit]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[when
President]{.mark} G.W. [Bush proposed that Ukraine (and Georgia) be
enrolled]{.mark} in Membership Action Plans ([MAPs]{.mark}), [the
next-to-last step before becoming allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. This was
a decisive move beyond the 1997 NATO-Ukraine Charter and consultative
Council, which provided no security guarantees. [Most allies resisted,
including because they were not prepared to take the risk of pushing
NATO right up to Russia]{.underline} and straddling the traditional
invasion route into the heart of Europe -- in both directions and with
long memories. How would Russia respond to such a step? But the European
allies also recognised that, although moving Ukraine and Georgia toward
NATO membership had to be ruled out, the US president could not be sent
home empty-handed. So [[the summit declared that both countries "will
become members" of the alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Those words were
designed to put off consideration of NATO membership for Ukraine and
Georgia to the indefinite future ("never," in the eyes of many European
allies.) But in their haste, [NATO's leaders obviously did not
understand the full import of that statement]{.underline}. It signaled
that the two countries were geopolitically so important to the West that
they would definitely be brought into the alliance, whatever Russia
thought: in plain English, it was thus the actual moment of commitment.
Soon thereafter, [[Georgia's president]{.mark}, Mikheil
[Saakashvili,]{.mark} [tested the proposition by using military force to
try reclaiming occupied parts of South Ossetia, only to be defeated by
Russia]{.mark}n forces. [Not a single NATO ally sent troops to defend
Georgia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finis, for any practical purposes, to
"will become members" of NATO. [[Yet instead of putting the commitment
into George Orwell's Memory Hole, NATO has repeated the formulation at
every summit]{.mark} and ministerial meeting, and, [until just before
Putin's 2022 invasion]{.mark}, top leaders of the Biden administration
were still harping on NATO's "open door" to Ukraine's membership, even
though it is a fantasy]{.underline}. This last observation is based on
two interrelated facts. First, NATO takes all decisions by consensus --
a unit veto; and second, [[many]{.mark} [allies have already made clear
that would never be willing, in response to aggression against
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} (on Russia's border), to invoke Article 5
of the NATO Treaty: that "...an armed attack against one or more
\[ally\]....shall be considered an attack against them all..." Thus
[[Ukraine will never be admitted to NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### 1NC \-\-- AT: Democratic Backsliding

#### Democratic Leaders are more aggressive

**Vasco 18** \[American Journal of Political Science, July 18, 2018,

*Caltech*,
https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/democracies-more-prone-start-wars-except-when-theyre-not-82879\]-Hayer

The difference boils down to public pressure, say the study\'s authors,
Michael Gibilisco of Caltech and Casey Crisman-Cox of Texas A&M
University. [Because of [pressure from voters to not back down and
appear weak, democratic leaders tend to act more aggressively in]{.mark}
international [conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[An
autocrat]{.mark}, on the other hand, [is answerable to no one and can
back down from a conflict without facing personal
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"If an elected leader makes a threat
during a conflict with another country and the threat isn\'t followed
through, they may face a decrease in approval ratings, or they may lose
an election,\" says Gibilisco, assistant professor of political
science[. [In democracies]{.mark}]{.underline}, he notes[, [voters can
punish]{.mark} [their leaders for appearing weak]{.mark}---these
punishments or consequences are known as \"audience costs\" in political
science parlance]{.underline}. To avoid those costs, leaders in
representative governments become more aggressive during disputes. In
their study, Gibilisco and Crisman-Cox, who is also an assistant
professor of political science, first developed a mathematical model of
dispute initiation between countries and then fit the model to data of
actual conflicts that occurred among 125 countries between 1993--2007.

#### Democratic governments are disadvantaged

[[Democracies are at a disadvantage]{.underline}]{.mark} relative to
non-democracies in two respects [when it comes to countering political
violence and insurgencies. First, they are accountable to a large
citizenship. If terrorist activity succeeds in increasing the risk of
death, it can create a widespread feeling of insecurity.]{.underline}
Because [[democratic governments are expected to safeguard the lives and
property of all of their citizens, they must respond in some way
to]{.mark} this increased [risk]{.mark}. [At the same time, democracies
are legitimate only]{.mark} to the extent [that they protect individual
freedoms and handle perpetrators through the legal system.]{.mark}
Terrorism, then, may also undermine government support]{.underline} if
authorities respond to threats too forcefully. [Provoking such
[over-reactions may even be an aim of]{.mark} some [terrorist
groups.]{.mark} This means that democratic political systems provide
more opportunities for the use of political violence than authoritarian
systems.]{.underline} Indeed, comparative research shows that democratic
governments experience more transnational terrorism than other
governments. Rebel groups fighting democracies in civil wars target
civilians more often than those fighting non-democracies, often using
terrorism to complement guerilla warfare and other military challenges
to government troops. Armed conflicts also tend to last longer in
democracies than in non-democracies, possibly because counter-insurgency
efforts are less brutal and hence less effective in restricting
opportunities for violent political opposition.

however]{.underline}, Denyer supposes, [[is]{.mark} the idea of
[mutually assured destruction (MAD)]{.mark}. Reflecting on the MAD
principle that provides the cornerstone of global nuclear policy, a
significant cyber-attack committed by Russia against the West could see
an equal level of retaliation]{.underline} which Moscow and Putin can
ill-afford as they become bogged down in the campaign against Ukraine.
"Russia is definitely among the top four or five cyber entities, with
the US being number one," Denyer said. "But from my understanding based
on the intelligence apparatus of the US, [[they are]{.mark} clearly
[aware that if they hit the US with any type of]{.mark} meaningful

#### 10 reasons why Nuclear Deterrence doesn't work

**Krieger 11** \[David Krieger, Krieger is President Emeritus of the
Nuclear Age Peace Foundation. He is the author and editor of many books
on peace and nuclear weapons abolition, including \"Speaking of Peace:
Quotations to Inspire Action.\", February 7, 2011, "TEN SERIOUS FLAWS IN
NUCLEA DETERRENCE THEORY\", *NUCLEAR AGE PEACE FOUNDATION*,
https://www.wagingpeace.org/ten-serious-flaws-in-nuclear-deterrence-theory/\]-Hayer

As volcanoes often give off strong warning signals that they may erupt,
so [[we have witnessed]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[signals
regarding]{.mark} nuclear arsenals and [the failure of nuclear
deterrence theory over the course of the Nuclear
Age]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Nuclear arsenals could erupt with
volcano-like force, totally overwhelming the relatively flimsy veneer of
"protection" provided by nuclear deterrence theory. In the face of such
dangers, we must not be complacent. Nor should we continue to be soothed
by the "experts" who assure us not to worry because the weapons will
keep us safe. [[There]{.underline}]{.mark} is, in fact, much to worry
about, much more than the nuclear policy makers and theorists in each of
the nuclear weapon states have led us to believe. I will examine below
what I believe [[are ten serious flaws in]{.mark} [nuclear deterrence
theory]{.mark}]{.underline}, flaws that lead to the conclusion that the
theory is unstable, unreliable and invalid. [[1. It is only a theory. It
is not proven and cannot be proven]{.underline}]{.mark}. A theory may
posit a causal relationship, for example, if one party does something,
certain results will follow. In the case of nuclear deterrence theory,
it is posited that if one party threatens to retaliate with nuclear
weapons, the other side will not attack. That an attack has not
occurred, however, does not prove that it was prevented by nuclear
deterrence. [[That is]{.mark}, in [logic, a false assumption of
causality.]{.mark} In logic, one cannot prove a negative, that is, that
doing something causes something else not to happen]{.underline}. That a
nuclear attack has not happened may be a result of any number of other
factors, or simply of exceptional good fortune. To attribute the absence
of nuclear war to nuclear deterrence is to register a false positive,
which imbues nuclear deterrence with a false sense of efficacy. [[2. It
requires a commitment to mass murder]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nuclear
deterrence leads to policy debates about how many threatened deaths with
nuclear weapons are enough to deter an adversary? [[Are one million
deaths sufficient to deter]{.mark} adversary A? Is it a different number
for adversary B? [How many deaths are sufficient]{.mark}? [One
million?]{.mark} [Ten million? One hundred million?
More?]{.mark}]{.underline} [There will always be a tendency to err on
the side of more deaths, and thus the creation of more elaborate nuclear
killing systems]{.underline}. Such calculations, in turn, drive arms
races, requiring huge allocations of resources to weapons systems that
must never be used. Leaders must convince their own populations that the
threat of mass murder and the expenditure of resources to support this
threat make them secure and is preferable to other allocations of
scientific and financial resources. The result is not only a
misallocation of resources, but also a diversion of effort away from
cooperative solutions to global problems. [[3. It requires effective
communications]{.underline}]{.mark}. In effect, nuclear deterrence is a
communications theory. [Side A must communicate its capability and
willingness to use its nuclear arsenal in retaliation for an attack by
adversary B, thereby preventing adversary B from attacking. [The threat
to retaliate and commit mass murder must be believable to a potential
attacker. Communications take place verbally in speeches by leaders and
parliamentary statements, as well as news reports]{.mark} and even by
rumors]{.underline}. Communications also take place non-verbally in the
form of alliance formations and nuclear weapons and missile tests. In
relation to nuclear deterrence, virtually everything that each side does
is a deliberate or inadvertent form of communication to a potential
adversary. There is much room for error and misunderstanding. [4[. It
requires rational decision makers]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Nuclear
deterrence will not be effective against a decision maker who is
irrational]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, side A may threaten
nuclear retaliation for an attack by adversary B, but the leader of side
B may irrationally conclude that the leader of side A will not do what
he says. Or, the leader of side B may irrationally attack side A because
he does not care if one million or ten million of his countrymen die as
a result of side A's nuclear retaliation. I believe two very important
questions to consider are these: [[Do all leaders of all states behave
rationally at all times,]{.mark} particularly under conditions of
extreme stress when tensions are very high?]{.underline} Can we be
assured that all leaders of all states will behave rationally at all
times in the future? Most people believe the answer to these questions
is an unqualified No. [5[. It instills a false sense of
confidence]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Nuclear deterrence is frequently
confused with nuclear "defense,"]{.underline}]{.mark} [leading to the
conclusion that nuclear weapons provide some form of physical protection
against attack]{.underline}. This conclusion is simply wrong. The
weapons and the threat of their use provide no physical protection. The
only protection provided is psychological and once the weapons start
flying it will become clear that psychological protection is not
physical protection. One can believe the weapons make him safer, but
this is not the same as actually being safer. Because nuclear deterrence
theory provides a false sense of confidence, it could lead a possessor
of the weapons to take risks that would be avoided without nuclear
threats in place. Such risks could be counterproductive and actually
lead to nuclear war. [[6. It does not work against an accidental use.
Nuclear deterrence is useful, if at all, only against the possibility of
an intentional, premeditated nuclear attack]{.underline}.]{.mark} Its
purpose is to make the leader who contemplates the intentional use of a
nuclear weapon decide against doing so. But nuclear deterrence cannot
prevent an accidental use of a nuclear weapon, such as an accidental
launch. This point was made in the movie Dr. Strangelove, in which a US
nuclear attack was accidentally set in motion against the Soviet Union.
In the movie, bomber crews passed their "failsafe" point in a training
exercise and couldn't be recalled. The president of the United States
had to get on the phone with his Soviet counterpart and try to explain
that the attack on Moscow that had been set in motion was just an
accident. The Americans were helpless to stop the accident from
occurring, and so were the Soviets. Accidents happen! There is no such
thing as a "foolproof" system, and when nuclear weapons are involved it
is extremely dangerous to think there is. [7[. It doesn't work against
terrorist organizations. Nuclear deterrence is based upon the threat of
retaliation.]{.mark} Since it is not possible to retaliate against a foe
that you cannot locate, the threat of retaliation is not credible under
these circumstances]{.underline}. Further, terrorists are often suicidal
(e.g., "suicide bombers"), and are willing to die to inflict death and
suffering on an adversary. For these reasons, nuclear deterrence will be
ineffective in preventing nuclear terrorism. The only way to prevent
nuclear terrorism is to prevent the weapons themselves from falling into
the hands of terrorist organizations. This will become increasingly
difficult if nuclear weapons and the nuclear materials to build them
proliferate to more and more countries. [8[. It encourages nuclear
proliferation. To the extent that the theory of nuclear deterrence is
accepted as valid and its flaws overlooked or ignored, it will make
nuclear weapons seem to be valuable instruments for the protection of a
country]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, the uncritical acceptance of nuclear
deterrence theory provides an incentive for nuclear proliferation. If it
is believed that nuclear weapons can keep a country safe, there will be
commensurate pressure to develop such weapons[. [9.]{.mark} It is [not
believable.]{.mark} In the final analysis, [it is likely that even the
policy makers who promote nuclear deterrence do not truly believe in
it.]{.mark} If policy makers did truly believe that nuclear deterrence
works as they claim, they would not need to develop missile
defenses]{.underline}. The United States alone has spent over \$100
billion on developing missile defenses over the past three decades, and
is continuing to spend some \$10 billion annually on missile defense
systems. Such attempts at physical protection against nuclear attacks
are unlikely to ever be fully successful, but they demonstrate the
underlying understanding of policy makers that nuclear deterrence alone
is insufficient to provide protection to a country. If policy makers
understand that nuclear deterrence is far from foolproof, then who is
being fooled by nuclear deterrence theory? In all likelihood, the only
people being fooled by the promised effectiveness of nuclear deterrence
theory are the ordinary people who place their faith in their leaders,
the same people who are the targets of nuclear weapons and will suffer
the consequences should nuclear deterrence fail. Their political and
military leaders have made them the "fools" in what is far from a
"foolproof" system. [[10. Its failure would be catastrophic. Nuclear
deterrence theory requires the development and deployment of nuclear
weapons for the threat of retaliation]{.mark}. These weapons can, of
course, be used for initiating attacks as well as for seeking to prevent
attacks by means of threatened retaliation]{.underline}. Should
deterrence theory fail, such failure could result in consequences beyond
our greatest fears. For example, scientists have found in simulations of
the use of 100 Hiroshima-size nuclear weapons in an exchange between
India and Pakistan, the deaths could reach one billion individuals due
to blast, fire, radiation, climate change, crop failures and resulting
starvation. A larger nuclear war between the US and Russia could destroy
civilization as we know it.

[[There]{.mark} simply [aren\'t enough nuclear warheads to kill everyone
directly]{.mark} with kinetic force, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} there
[likely [never will be]{.mark}. [There are \~14,000 nuclear weapons in
the world]{.mark}, and let's [suppose they have an average]{.mark} yield
of [something like 1 megaton]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a
conservative guess, the actual average is probably closer to 100
kilotons. [[With a 1 megaton warhead, you can create a fireball covering
3 km²,]{.mark} and a moderate pressure wave that knocks down most
residential houses covering 155 km².]{.underline} The former kills
nearly everyone and the latter kills a decent percentage of people but
not everyone. Let\'s be conservative and [[assume the pressure wave
kills everyone in its radius. 14,000 \* 155 = 2.17 million
km².]{.mark}]{.underline} The New York Metro area is 8,683 km². So [[all
the nuclear weapons in the world could destroy about 250 New York Metro
areas. This is]{.underline}]{.mark} a lot! But [[not near
enough,]{.underline}]{.mark} even if someone intentionally tried to hit
all the populations at once. [[Total land surface of earth is: 510.1
million km²]{.underline}]{.mark}. Urban area, by one estimate, is about
2%, or 10.2 million km.² Since the total possible area destroyed from
nuclear weapons is \~2.17 million km² is considerably less than a lower
bound on the area of human habitation, 10.2 million km², there should be
basically no risk of human extinction from kinetic destruction.
