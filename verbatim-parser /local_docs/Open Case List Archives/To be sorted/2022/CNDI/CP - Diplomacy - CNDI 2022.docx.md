# DIPLOMACY CP

### Notes

#### Overview:

The CP tests whether "security cooperation" is needed or desirable.
Instead of increasing military assistance, it promotes diplomatic
engagement (non-military). That's not to say it doesn't try to promote
security, it just avoids using military mechanism and personnel.
Instead, it cooperates at higher levels, with diplomats and relevant
civil sectors.

There are a lot of technical definitions (see T file) that specify
security cooperation as Department of Defense (DoD) activities, whereas
diplomatic assistance if implemented by the Department of State (DoS).
In this case, the CP could be seen as an agent CP. Few affs will specify
their agent, so it's also important to think about the philosophical
difference and lean into the cards that define security cooperation as
military-to-military engagement.

Two possible net-benefits: one internal and one external. The internal
net-benefit is about reducing "creeping militarism" in US foreign policy
and reestablishing the credibility of our diplomats. The external
net-benefit is that it avoids the Russia DA because diplomatic
engagement is more sensitive to political and cultural realities and the
perception of the CP will be less aggressive.

#### Pros:

The CP attempts to expose the fact that few aff cards will say "NATO"
and "security cooperation" in the same paragraph. Most are about general
coordination, cooperation, and shared policy goals. The CP can
accomplish all of that without military assistance, especially around
emerging tech.

The softer/lefter the aff, the more the CP solves. Any aff that talks
about norms, shared principals, data, and other policies not related to
weapons systems can be solved by diplomatic action.

The militarism bad/diplomatic cred good NB has good impacts, and you
might be able to win it turns the aff.

#### Cons:

The more the aff is about defense capabilities and military responses,
the less the CP solves.

The militarization NB is inevitable and non-unique. If Ukraine doesn't
thump, I'm not sure what does.

It probably still links to the Russia DA. The cards about perception and
the way military escalate are ok, but Russia/China wouldn't love any
alliance action on emerging tech.

#### To Do:

Specific mechanisms or solvency arguments for specific plans.

More competition cards distinguishing security cooperation from
non-security cooperation.

DOD specific trade-off DA. If affs start to own DOD action and craft
their advantages around "hard right" military postures, then the neg
will need to generate links off of DOD resource tradeoffs.

<https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/19963/the-pitfalls-of-the-pentagon-taking-the-lead-on-u-s-security-assistance>)

Burkina Faso, a small West African country that most Americans have
never heard of and that saw a popular uprising in 2014 and attempted
coup a year later, has received more than \$4 million in the past 10
years to help professionalize its military. However, even with
consistent U.S. security assistance, the State Department reports
significant human rights concerns in Burkina Faso, including
extrajudicial killings by security forces and excessive use of force,
such as torture, against civilians. Burkina Faso is not the only country
receiving U.S. security assistance despite a questionable human rights
record. Every year, the United States spends billions of dollars on
military and security assistance to foreign governments through programs
run by both the State Department and the Department of Defense. But [in
the past 15 years, the scope and magnitude of the Pentagon's programs
have expanded dramatically]{.underline}. Experts now estimate the
Pentagon alone spends \$8 billion to \$10 billion a year on assistance
to more than 180 countries---compared to approximately \$8 billion a
year by the State Department to 147 countries---[which has led many to
question the apparent **militarization** of U.S. security assistance and
the impact that has on short- and long-term security and foreign policy
objectives. **[Oversight]{.mark} [and transparency]{.mark}**
[over]{.mark} these myriad [programs]{.mark} [are]{.mark} often
extremely [difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}. Numerous government accounts
provide this money, and depending on the program, different
congressional committees maintain oversight. [[The]{.mark} [stove-piped
nature of U.S. **military**]{.mark} [assistance]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
steadfast **[secrecy]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} [surrounds]{.mark}
[decisions]{.mark} made for reasons of "national security" often [create
an artificial division]{.mark} [between]{.mark} [national
security]{.mark} interests [and]{.mark} [foreign policy]{.mark}
ideals]{.underline}. They also make it nearly impossible to identify the
exact amount of spending, to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of
various programs, and to avoid duplicating resources and efforts across
different offices and agencies. [[This **tension**]{.mark} between the
State Department and the Pentagon [is not new]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
decades, there have been contradictions between advancing U.S. security
interest and foreign policy goals, such as the protection of human
rights. Traditionally, the State Department was the primary
decision-maker that determined who received security assistance and for
what purpose. Yet all of that began to change after Sept. 11. Before
9/11, Congress had already begun authorizing the Pentagon to support
foreign militaries in roles that had long been filled by the State
Department. Starting with anti-drug training in the Western Hemisphere,
the number and size of these programs has steadily grown since. In the
aftermath of Sept. 11, the purpose of "train and equip" programs was
altered to fill an expanding list of priorities to "build partner
capacity," known as BPC. A RAND Corporation study in 2013 found that of
184 unique authorities that underwrite 165 BPC programs, at least 70 are
managed and can be utilized by the Pentagon to provide security
cooperation. The mandates of these programs are vast, ranging from
counterterrorism to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. After
9/11, the Defense Department created military assistance programs to
supplement traditional State Department ones. But from the outset, the
appropriated funds that support these programs were subject to fewer
restrictions than their State Department counterparts. For example, the
Pentagon's Regional Defense Counterterrorism Fellowship Program was
originally created in 2002 with a mandate that critics claimed served
the same purpose as the State Department's International Military
Education and Training program. The Pentagon program provided nonlethal
counterterrorism training, but lethal training was made available two
years later. [Beyond the lack of transparency and oversight, a larger
and more philosophical concern is that **[foreign policy has become
militarized]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Similarly, in 2006, the Pentagon was
authorized to use \$200 million of its Operation and Maintenance funds
to equip and train foreign militaries for counterterrorism operations.
In creating these parallel training authorities and funding them through
the defense budget, the Pentagon is, in effect, able to implement its
security assistance without applying Foreign Assistance Act
restrictions, which are intended to ensure that human rights and other
foreign policy concerns are taken into consideration when determining
the provision of security assistance. Experts have counted a tripling of
military assistance out of the Pentagon budget from 2008 to 2015. That
money comes with greater influence. And although the State Department
can veto some programs, others are outside its authority, and program
planning is not always shared with State Department personnel. After
9/11, the Pentagon gained a larger role, not just because it had the
money, but because it was believed that it had the experience and means
to react more quickly to changing situations and needs in an expansive
and fast growing war on terror. While many of the countries receiving
Pentagon military assistance are seen as national security priorities,
their behavior often raises foreign policy concerns that make diplomatic
engagement difficult. Providing arms to these countries also increases
the risk that U.S.-origin weapons could be used against the United
States, its soldiers, its allies and/or its interests. In many cases,
[**[military]{.mark}** [and security]{.mark} [assistance]{.mark} [is
provided]{.mark} [to achieve]{.mark} short-term [security]{.mark}
[gains]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} [may]{.mark} **[undermine]{.mark}
[long-term U.S foreign policy interests]{.mark}.**]{.underline} These
issues are compounded by the fact that the Pentagon simply has more
money and resources to address these concerns, and it has become easier
for it to simply foot the bill. Pentagon spending on military assistance
has totaled at least \$122 billion since 2001, compared to approximately
\$119 billion for the State Department. The Security Assistance Monitor,
a program of the Center for International Policy that tracks U.S.
security assistance to countries around the world, has documented a
tenfold increase in Pentagon security aid programs since 2001---from \$1
billion in 2001 to \$10.8 billion in 2015. State Department spending
nearly doubled in that time from \$4.6 billion to \$8.3 billion.
However, it is not the dollar figure that is worth comparing, but rather
the meteoric rise of Pentagon spending, as opposed to a more gradual
increase from the State Department. This increased spending has made
some observers apprehensive. A Congressional Research Service report
last May raised serious concerns about the roles of the State Department
and the Pentagon with regard to security assistance and reconciling
foreign policy objectives with security goals. It highlighted the lack
of reporting requirements for Pentagon programs compared to the State
Department and the resulting lack of oversight and accounting. In
addition, Pentagon programs are not subject to country-by-country public
reporting, making understanding a recipient country's priorities,
activities and funding impossible. At least 66 Pentagon programs do not
allow any specific country information to be made available at all.
Beyond this lack of transparency and oversight, a larger and more
philosophical concern is that foreign policy has become militarized.
Recipient countries and communities have the impression that help only
comes from the U.S. military, which changes the context of assistance
and the relationship with those receiving it. The mission and its
perception differ depending on whether the help comes from the U.S.
military, or instead from the U.S. Embassy, the United States Agency for
International Development or other civil servants from various U.S.
government agencies. Today, [American [security assistance]{.mark} [has
become **unnecessarily**]{.mark} **[military]{.mark} in nature**, simply
because there are additional Pentagon]{.underline} funds and
[programs]{.underline} that can quickly move money. At a fundamental
level, when speaking with members of the U.S. military involved in these
types of missions, such as building schools or bridges in African
countries, they have recognized that they are simply there to complete
their work and to strengthen [**[military-to-military]{.mark}**
[relationships]{.mark}]{.underline}. They often [**[don't worry
about]{.mark} [diplomatic]{.mark}** aspects or the types of
[relationships]{.mark} they are establishing.]{.underline} To be sure,
developing any relationship, particularly in countries with questionable
and at times poor records of democracy and human rights, is important,
and military relationships may buy the security that is desired in the
short term. But in the long term, [[without **deeper
diplomatic**]{.mark} **[relationships]{.mark} [and nonmilitary]{.mark}
[engagement]{.mark}**, [it will be **impossible**]{.mark} [to
achieve]{.mark} larger [strategic]{.mark} [objectives]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} foster [an]{.mark} **[environment of]{.mark}
[trust]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

<https://www.americanprogress.org/article/plan-reform-u-s-security-assistance/>)-mikee

Today, U.S. aid to build up a partner's military should be viewed
through the lens of competition between states, in addition to the
ongoing counterterrorism concerns and state fragility challenges, with
much higher stakes for U.S. foreign policy and national interests. This
renewed geopolitical competition is at its core an ideological
competition between states. China's rise and Russia's resurgence require
the United States to realign its foreign policy toward strengthening
relations and bolstering democratic states. Security assistance is a
tool to do so: It strengthens America's closest partners and fosters
closer relationships with other states. When a country accepts U.S.
military equipment or enters into a long-term procurement or acquisition
of U.S. defense equipment, they are tying their country to the United
States. The U.S. decision, for instance, to provide military aid to the
United Kingdom through the lend-lease program in the 1940s was not a
simple military consideration but a foreign policy consideration with
enormous consequences.7 Today, U.S. decisions to provide weapons or
support tie American officials to how that support is used---whether
they like it or not---as the case of U.S. support to the Saudi-led
coalition in Yemen demonstrates. Moreover, [countries that receive U.S.
military systems are not just buying equipment off the shelf; they are
entering into a longer-term relationship with that country for training,
maintenance, and sustainment.]{.underline} This is similar to when a
consumer buys a smart phone, as they are not simply buying a piece of
hardware; they are reliant on the company to access its broader
ecosystem of apps and software and trusting the company to safeguard
important data. [Over time, a consumer becomes locked in and dependent
on a particular provider. Similarly, when a state commits to expanding
military-to-military ties---often the most sensitive area for a
country---they are making a diplomatic bet on that country.]{.underline}
As they base their military on U.S. equipment and U.S. training and
engagement, they similarly become locked in to the United States. This
sets the ground for more productive American partnerships to tackle a
range of geopolitical challenges. For example, U.S. security assistance
has been key to building ties with Vietnam after the war between the two
countries. American assistance provided to clear unexploded ordnance has
helped repair diplomatic relations between Hanoi and Washington, while
the recent provision of a retired Coast Guard ship to the Vietnam
military can help strengthen military ties and potentially open the door
to more U.S. assistance and security cooperation, which will further
strengthen bilateral relations.8 [There are several reasons that
[today's security]{.mark} [assistance system must change]{.mark}:
**[Current security policy decision-making perpetuates the status
quo]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The current system perpetuates an
ineffective status quo, whereby the United States often fails to
effectively exert significant diplomatic leverage that it has through
security assistance because the bureaucratic structure to administer
it---both within the State Department and between the State Department
and the DOD---is not designed to advance diplomatic efforts but merely
to administer appropriated funds.9 This makes it challenging to change
security assistance programs given shifting foreign policy dynamics or
changes in a partner's behavior that may make them a less suitable
recipient of U.S. security aid, such as democratic backsliding or a
pattern of human rights abuses. [[U.S. engagement]{.mark} with partners
[could be]{.mark} [dominated by military issues]{.mark} [if foreign
officials turn to DOD]{.mark} counterparts [instead of diplomats]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} assistance [resources]{.mark}.]{.underline} Because the DOD
controls its own security assistance accounts, other foreign policy
concerns may get trumped if partners go around the State Department to
get aid from the Pentagon. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) worried at a 2017
Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that the shift to increasing
DOD authorities could "send a fundamental message that the United States
considers security relationships over all other U.S. foreign policy
objectives or concerns, including human rights or good governance."10
Under the current framework, the State Department's ability to put the
brakes on security assistance or military cooperation under DOD
authorities is highly limited because the State Department does not
control implementation and can often only approve or disapprove of DOD
proposals. [While State Department officials and ambassadors can and
sometimes do halt or temper problematic efforts, doing so requires
exerting significant political capital that is in short
supply]{.underline}.11 Centralizing control at the State Department
would help to fix this bureaucratic imbalance between diplomacy and the
Pentagon. [[Defense priorities]{.mark} often [undervalue]{.mark}
**[democratic and human]{.mark} [rights]{.mark}
[concerns]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Compared with the State Department,
[the DOD is less equipped to effectively weigh human rights concerns in
its decision-making.]{.underline} [This makes it harder to leverage U.S.
military cooperation for economic or political concessions or changes
that might bolster democratic goals.]{.underline} For example, U.S.
military objectives to counter terrorist groups in Somalia called for
continuously supplying Uganda with U.S. assistance despite growing human
rights and democracy concerns.12 Putting the State Department in charge
would make it easier to realign U.S. security assistance toward
democratic states and effectively consider human rights issues in every
security assistance decision. [[Security assistance]{.mark} in a tense
era of great power competition [is extremely]{.mark} [sensitive]{.mark}
and can increase tension and lead to miscalculation]{.underline}. [[The
**risk**]{.mark} **[in today's]{.mark} geopolitical
[environment]{.mark}** [is that providing]{.mark} sensitive and
potentially [**provocative** assistance]{.mark} [will not receive the
same]{.mark} [**scrutiny** from policymakers]{.mark} and will become the
norm for the administering agency, the DOD]{.underline}. In the last era
of great power competition, the Cold War, **[[security
assistance]{.mark} often [stoked tension]{.mark} [between the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} [the Soviet Union]{.mark}
[and led to spiraling commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For instance,
Soviet provision of nuclear missiles to Cuba led to a nuclear standoff,
while U.S. military support for Vietnam led to deepening U.S.
engagement. [[As competition with **China and Russia**]{.mark}
[increases]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[security assistance]{.mark}
[could]{.mark} once again [prove a **major source**]{.mark} **[of
tension and]{.mark} cause [miscalculation]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[Providing aid in this environment is not a mere technical military
matter, but ultimately a political and diplomatic concern that is highly
sensitive]{.underline}. Yet today, it is the DOD that is driving
assistance to countries such as Ukraine and regions such as Southeast
Asia.13 When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the National Security
Council became significantly involved in policymaking and limited types
of assistance that could be provided, including lethal aid.14 Such
unique scrutiny was warranted because there was a crisis involving a
U.S. partner and a nuclear-armed state. But the nature of White House
intervention was necessary in large part because the security assistance
process---for both decision-making and for providing assistance---was
broken. [[A]{.mark} [military]{.mark}-led [response]{.mark} can
**[overprioritize]{.mark} [military engagement]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
could unintentionally [steer]{.mark} American engagements into
**[high-risk]{.mark} [confrontations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Without
careful]{.underline} calibration and [understanding of broader
**political** context]{.underline}, [there is real concern that the
DOD]{.underline} could get ahead of U.S. policy or [drive]{.underline}
it in [a more military-centric direction]{.underline}. For example,
**[[China could]{.mark} [interpret the DOD']{.mark}s]{.underline}**
provision of some security assistance through the agency's Southeast
Asia Maritime Security Initiative **[[as an act of]{.mark}
[aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}** [if it is not carefully and
effectively calibrated against broader political concerns in the
region]{.underline}.15 [Given the political sensitivities of great power
competition, responsibility and oversight for security assistance
decisions should rest with the agency most in tune with broader U.S.
foreign policy concerns and diplomatic developments: the State
Department.]{.underline} Reforming security assistance by centralizing
it at the State Department would help to elevate the diplomatic
considerations of this policy area, while reducing the military-first
priorities of the current system that are ill-suited to today's
geopolitical challenges.

#### Diplomacy is best for achieving successful multilateral goals

**Powell '22** (Jo Ellen, career member of the United States Foreign
Service who served as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
Human Resources, "Bringing America's Multilateral Diplomacy into the
21st Century," Academy of Diplomacy,
https://www.academyofdiplomacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bringing-Americas-Multilateral-Diplomacy-into-the-21st-Century-FINAL.pdf)

In his February 4, 2021, address to the U.S. Department of State,
President Joseph R. Biden declared "[[diplomacy]{.mark} [is]{.mark} back
[at the center of]{.mark} our [foreign]{.mark}
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline}."1 The President called on the Department
of State [[to meet]{.mark} accelerating [global challenges]{.mark}, from
the pandemic to the climate crisis to nuclear proliferation, by working
in common with other nations]{.underline}. He spoke of global diplomacy,
and global power, as America's inexhaustible source of strength and its
abiding advantage. Many perceive that advantage has eroded over the
years. Today, [[the]{.mark} [D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f
[S]{.mark}tate [has a **singular opportunity**]{.mark} [to
lead]{.mark}]{.underline} an interagency
[[collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark} to restore that advantage, with the
support of the Administration and other interested agencies. [To achieve
this, the State Department cannot exclusively rely on]{.underline} its
traditional model of [bilateral diplomacy; [**multilateral diplomacy**
must become a]{.mark} [greater focus of the Department's
efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}. To effectively address the global
challenges the President discussed, the Department must exert equal
effort in its multilateral and bilateral diplomacy. Although the U.S.
remains virtually unmatched in its economic and social influence and
power, the gap between it and the competition is narrowing. It is no
longer true (if it ever was) that the U.S. does not need a global range
of partners to address global crises. China is rapidly extending its
presence and influence in international organizations, including
international financial institutions, as are other countries, such as
Russia and India. [[The U.S. must build strong]{.mark} and enduring
[partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline} with countries beyond its traditional
alliances, particularly in Latin America and Africa. As political
dynamics and world powers shifted, the U.S. response was often to
disengage from multilateral diplomacy. Yet, disengagement did not lead
to resolution. We must set aside the notion that international
organizations excessively constrain or disproportionately burden the
United States. To manage the global issues we face today and for the
foreseeable future, we need to work with a global coalition of partners,
even when not all of them agree with the United States all the time. In
considering how to meet these challenges, it is useful to examine how
other countries have maximized their multilateral influence. Smaller
nations often see international organizations as the most effective way
to leverage their influence. The Nordic countries are an oft-cited
example of the smart application of multilateral diplomacy, but the
U.K., France, Japan, and Germany also give considerable weight and
attention to multilateral diplomacy, with highly effective results.
These successful practitioners of multilateral diplomacy have several
practices and approaches in common. Their diplomats' entry-level
training includes serious emphasis on multilateral diplomacy and
negotiation; their career paths often involve multiple assignments to or
within international organizations; and their foreign ministries are
actively engaged in recruitment and advocacy for placement in
international bodies of highly qualified applicants at all levels, from
interns to senior executives. Other characteristics they share that the
U.S. cannot easily adopt are greater ease of movement between their
Civil and Foreign Services and the absence of an "up or out" promotion
system. Both sets of characteristics enhance those countries'
flexibility to second personnel to international organizations, and the
latter somewhat offsets the nearly universal perception that secondments
are not helpful to one's career. [Effective multilateral diplomacy is
essential for the U.S. to achieve its foreign policy
objectives]{.underline} and effective bilateral engagement is arguably
the most critical element of successful multilateral diplomacy[. [U.S.
diplomats **must set the**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[standard]{.mark}**,
not just throughout the U.S. government, but worldwide, [for **effective
multilateral diplomacy**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Our
recommendations to achieve this fall into three categories: policy,
practice, and preparation.

#### Achieving consensus at NATO requires [diplomatic]{.underline}, not military, efforts

**Burns '21** (Nicholas, Professor of Diplomacy and IR at Harvard, "A
Time for Diplomacy," *Belfer Center*,
<https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/time-diplomacy)//BB>

**[[Diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[works
best]{.underline}]{.mark}** when far-sighted leaders take charge of a
crisis and point the way ahead. [[Think of]{.underline}]{.mark}: FDR and
[[Churchill's organization]{.mark} [of a]{.mark} massive global
[coalition]{.mark}]{.underline} to defeat Nazi Germany and Imperial
Japan. Helmut Kohl, Mikhail [Gorbachev]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
George H.W. [Bush's [negotiations to unite Germany
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} Alliance and to
end the Cold War. Nelson [Mandela]{.underline} who used a four-year
diplomatic negotiation to dismantle and destroy the apartheid regime.
Angela [Merkel]{.underline} who led the world diplomatically in
confronting and sanctioning Vladimir Putin following Russia's illegal
annexation of Crimea in 2014. Diplomacy and negotiations, of course, do
not always succeed. At its worst, if diplomacy fails, war, lawlessness,
and destruction ensue -- Vietnam, Rwanda, and Iraq in the past. Syria,
Tigray, Myanmar, and China's power grab in the South China Sea in the
present. That is one reason why it is so important to integrate
effectively the work of ambassadors and Generals combined with the
unique power of intelligence officers. Foreign policy making in the U.S.
Government is a team sport. It takes coordination among all the
country's actors to succeed. We diplomats understand that our ability to
succeed is often related directly to the intelligence on which we depend
and the military partners with whom we share power. It has long been
understood that diplomacy and defense are inextricably tied to each
other. [When I was U.S. Ambassador to NATO, the majority of my staff was
from the Pentagon]{.underline} -- both the uniformed military and
Defense Department civilians. [We thought hard about aligning our
diplomatic moves with our military might]{.underline}. When we responded
to the 9/11 attacks, we drew on the resources of both diplomats and
warriors. When NATO went into Afghanistan, we thought of it as a
combined military and diplomatic mission. What has been missing in the
U.S. government in recent years is a strong, energetic, self-confident
diplomatic corps. President [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Secretary of State Tony [[Blinken]{.mark}
[have shown they appreciate]{.mark} the need to [elevate
diplomacy]{.mark} as a first-order priority for the United
States]{.underline}. From their first days in office, they have
emphasized their determination to strengthen America's diplomatic power
in the world. President Biden chose the State Department as the site of
his first foreign policy speech. Some of his earliest and most notable
appointments immediately strengthened our diplomatic bench behind
Secretary Tony Blinken -- Ambassadors Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Wendy
Sherman, Victoria Nuland, and Samantha Power, as well as an impressive
and experienced NSC team led by Jake Sullivan, Jon Finer, Kurt Campbell,
Laura Rosenberger, Sumona Guha, and many others. For President Biden's
new emphasis on diplomacy to succeed, however, the career Foreign
Service, in particular, will need to be strengthened dramatically. It is
no secret that the Foreign and Civil Service are at their lowest points
in morale and effectiveness in the memory of anyone listening today in
this Zoom room. I began my diplomatic career 41 years ago as an intern
at our embassy in Nouakchott, Mauritania in the Sahara Desert. I have
witnessed many highs and lows of American diplomacy since. Frankly, I
have been shocked to see the damage done to the career Foreign Service
during the last four years. The result is disastrously low morale, a
lack of budgetary support, the debilitating departure of some of our
most senior career diplomats, the sidelining of the Service for a time,
and the resulting lack of confidence in its future by a younger
generation of diplomats who will be most critical to its resurrection.
President Biden and Secretary Blinken have a rare opportunity to lead a
radical overhaul at [[the State Department]{.underline}]{.mark}. Under
their leadership, this [[must remain]{.mark} [a first-order
priority]{.mark} for the administration]{.underline}. In November just
following the Presidential election, two former American Ambassadors,
Marc Grossman, Marcie Ries, and I released a Harvard Kennedy School
report entitled, "A U.S. Diplomatic Service for the 21st Century." Our
goal was to recommend the fundamental steps necessary to reform the
Foreign Service and to reposition it for success in the future. Based on
conversations with over 200 people inside the U.S. government and beyond
in over 40 workshops during the past pandemic year, we reported that the
Foreign Service "is confronting one of the most profound crises in its
long and proud history." We recommended a determined, bipartisan effort
to revive and restructure it. Specifically, we called for a new Foreign
Service Act by Congress to set a renewed mission and mandate for the
21st century diplomatic corps. The last time Congress passed such an Act
was in 1980 when the world was a very different place with very
different challenges. than it is now. We advocated a "relentless focus
on diversity" to counteract the woeful lack of progress in the
percentage of African Americans, women, Latinx Americans, Asian
Americans and other minorities in the senior ranks of American
diplomacy. We called for the creation of a new Diplomatic Reserve Corps
and a Mid-Level entry program to ensure the inclusion in the diplomatic
ranks of experienced citizens with specialized skills. Given the
proliferation of political appointee Ambassadors at the State
Department, we also recommended that, by 2025, 90 percent of Ambassadors
should be career appointees, not 70 percent as is the current practice.
We also recommended that 75 percent of the powerful Assistant Secretary
of State positions be held by career officers. During the Trump
Administration, not a single one of these Assistant Secretary positions
was led by a Senate-confirmed career officer. This was the first time in
memory that the Foreign Service had been entirely unrepresented at that
critical leadership level. Finally, we proposed to rename the "Foreign
Service of the United States" the "United States Diplomatic Service." We
believe it signals transformation and reinforces the vital role our

with the two words, of course, that are most important -- United States.
A reinforced career diplomatic corps would help President Biden and his
successors from either party to revive American leadership in the world.
President Biden's great insight has been to see our alliances as the
critical asset we have in this long-term battle for global power and the
future of democracy. [The [NATO]{.mark} Alliance [is fundamental]{.mark}
to a long-term peace in Europe. It has expanded a zone of
security]{.underline} to encompass the great majority of Europeans, East
and West. It protects all of us, particularly smaller countries, from

#### Diplomacy solves alliance cohesion and achieves foreign policy goals. 

**Haass '20** (Richard, President of the Council on Foreign Relations,
"Revitalizing the State Department and American Diplomacy," *Council
Special Report* No. 89)//BB

[[Diplomacy]{.mark} [is]{.mark} a [critical]{.mark} tool in a nation's
foreign policy tool kit, enabling a country to leverage its power and
bring it to bear on critical international issues]{.underline}. [[The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tate[s']{.mark} [most]{.mark} [enduring
advantage]{.mark} over its rivals [is]{.mark}]{.underline} its
unprecedented network of [[alliances]{.mark}, and]{.underline} through
consultations officials and **[[diplomats maintain these]{.mark}
[relationships]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [enlist allies in common]{.mark}
[causes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Those representing the government are
tasked to negotiate treaties, dealing with issues from arms control to
climate change, and advance U.S. interests in international
organizations. They are the face of America overseas]{.underline},
representing the country around the world and providing critical
services to Americans traveling abroad. [[Too often]{.mark}, however,
**[diplomacy is neglected]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Sometimes serious
diplomacy is sidelined in favor of unrealistic calls for regime change
or demands that the other party cannot reasonably be expected to meet. A
related problem, one highlighted by former Secretary of Defense Robert
M. Gates, is that American foreign policy has become over-militarized,
with the military asked to perform missions such as nation-building that
it was never intended to. While the Department of Defense receives
record appropriations, the Department of State struggles to have its
comparatively small budget approved. In this valuable and timely Council
Special Report, Jon Finer, an adjunct senior fellow for U.S. foreign
policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, and Uzra S. Zeya, the CEO
and president of the Alliance for Peacebuilding, propose policies for
revitalizing the State Department and American diplomacy. They rightly
assess that the Department of State "has fallen into a deep and
sustained period of crisis." They point out that the State Department is
currently enduring turbulence but, equally important, that many of its
problems are deep-seated and predate the Donald J. Trump administration.
They provide an array of policy proposals they believe the State
Department can and should implement to restore American diplomacy. The
list of proposals is long, and few readers will agree with all of them.
In some cases what is put forward will likely meet with bureaucratic or
congressional resistance. What is clear and inarguable, though, is that
[[U.S. foreign policy needs]{.mark} [to]{.mark} better
[recognize]{.mark} and reflect the unique and valuable contributions of
**[diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The State Department needs to
rethink its organization along with the role of embassies and those who
serve in them, attract individuals with more diverse backgrounds, skill
sets, and experience, and reimagine career paths and training
opportunities. The goal should be to attract the best and brightest to
the State Department, be it for a career or a stint, and to invest in
them so that those designing and carrying out American foreign policy
have the creativity and professionalism required to meet the challenges
and opportunities of a twenty-first-century world. All of which is to
say that **[[revitalizing the State]{.mark} [Department]{.mark} [should
be a priority]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** next **[administration]{.underline}** regardless
of who occupies the Oval Office.

### S -- Emerging Tech 

#### The State Department's diplomatic expertise solve emerging tech issues better -- it avoids the security-dominated approach that causes retaliation. 

**Saeed '21**, (Ferial Ara Saeed is CEO of Telegraph Strategies LLC, a

of political and economic trends, "A STATE DEPARTMENT FOR THE DIGITAL
AGE," War on the Rocks, JUNE 21, 2021,

But [**[emerging technology]{.mark}** policy [requires]{.mark} equal
[consideration]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the **[economic and political
challenges]{.mark}** that these technologies present in the hands of
competitors and adversaries. AI,]{.underline} for instance, [could give
autocrats greater capacity to manipulate public opinion, destabilize
democracies, and monitor their citizens.]{.underline} [It makes as much
sense for arms control specialists to formulate and drive the required
policy responses as it does to ask democracy experts to address the
strategic stability questions raised by hypersonic missiles (another
emerging technology]{.underline}). [Economic interests fare no
better]{.underline}. The last administration reached into its security
policy toolkit to regulate "the availability of things" in response to
China's unfair practices in the technology race with United States,
risking American innovation leadership and economic competitiveness.
While some may argue that the administration was responding to the
perceived loss of U.S. competitiveness resulting from China's predatory
trade practices, U.S. industry, at the center of the storm, certainly
did not see it that way. American technology companies pushed back hard
against the worst of these policies on the grounds that they would not
only harm their interests but also the U.S. economy, and so undercut the
very goals that the administration was trying to achieve. **[[The
strategic risks of a security-dominated]{.mark} [approach]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} even [broader]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Restrictive U.S.
policies and China's responses to them also turned the dial of
Sino-American relations decisively towards]{.underline}
**[confrontation]{.underline}**. A warier, more critical approach to
Beijing is warranted, but Washington has to walk a fine line to keep the
complicated mix of rivalry and mutual interests in the relationship from
spilling over or prompting hedging by other states. **[[A
security-dominated approach]{.mark} to emerging technologies [is]{.mark}
simply too blunt and [too narrow]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Arms control
specialists, with their focus on security, unquestionably have a
critical role to play on such issues as seeking a global prohibition
against AI-enabled systems deciding when to deploy nuclear weapons. [But
[leading the State Department]{.mark} on emerging technology policy
[requires perspective]{.mark} [on a diversity of]{.mark} vital U[.S.
interests]{.mark} that go well beyond security]{.underline}. Technology
Policy at the State Department: Too Many Cooks [[Moving]{.mark}
[oversight]{.mark} of the emerging technologies portfolio [to the deputy
secretary of state]{.mark} for management and resources]{.underline},
who has broad responsibilities for policy and management, [[would be a
good start]{.underline}]{.mark}. But it would still not address the
bigger organizational challenges that rightly concern Congress.
Lawmakers want the department to fix the coordination problems that
limit its effectiveness on technology issues, elevate cyber diplomacy as
a foreign policy priority, and ensure equal focus on economic, security,
and political concerns. Congress also seeks a separate China strategy,
given the decisive role of technology competition in Sino-American
rivalry. Yet, for all that lawmakers get right about what ails the State
Department organizationally, not a single congressional proposal tackles
the fundamental problem: the department's balkanized technology policy
landscape, which stretches across more than a dozen regional and
functional bureaus. Five undersecretaries divide oversight of this
policy sprawl: political affairs, arms control, economic affairs,
civilian security, and public affairs. None are technology experts. Each
has a mandate, a budget, and bureaucratic turf to protect. Lawmakers are
merely tinkering at the margins, proposing the consolidation of some
functions or adding new layers of bureaucracy to solve a coordination
and integration problem that starts on the ground floor, not inside the
boardroom. [[Without changes]{.mark} [at the State Department]{.mark},
[a]{.mark} [security]{.mark}-[focused]{.mark} [approach]{.mark} [will
dominate]{.mark} emerging technology policy. This critical area of
foreign policy will resemble an arms control agreement: a maze of
constraints, hurdles, and walls. [U.S. economic]{.mark} [competitiveness
will]{.mark} also [be at risk]{.mark} because traditional arms control
thinking tends to be "prohibitory and regulatory," so in interagency
policy deliberations the State Department will be inclined to support
burdensome and expensive new layers of restrictions on business in the
interest of security]{.underline}. Of course, it will be important to
take security considerations into account when thinking about economic
and technology policy toward China. But it should not be the only
consideration. Absent important bureaucratic changes, other priorities
like promoting internet freedom and international cyber stability will
suffer from the absence of high-level attention. Furthermore, [while
counterpart agencies like the Departments of Defense and Homeland
Security build the deep bench of expertise necessary to adapt to an era
of geostrategic competition rooted in technology, the [State]{.mark}
[Department]{.mark} will fall further behind in this area --- where its
[leadership]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [essential]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[America's]{.mark} well-being and [success]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Consolidate Technology Policy Functions Solutions are not simple, but
they are obvious. First, the State Department should create a new
undersecretary position and bring all technology issues under it, as the
congressionally established National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence recommends. The undersecretary should have broad expertise
in technology and its applications. Consolidation will improve
coordination and rapid decision-making when trade-offs are required,
while developing a cadre of tech-savvy cyber diplomats. The department's
large country desks provide proof of concept. They build deep and
practical country expertise because they are multidisciplinary.
Information is routinely shared among desk officers handling diverse
portfolios --- political, economic, and security. Political and economic
considerations factor seamlessly into security policy, and vice versa.
This integrated, coordinated approach makes country desks formidable
policy players. They are well-rounded and respected for their knowledge
and advocacy of reliably well-coordinated initiatives and positions,
road-tested across competing U.S. interests. That is the model to
emulate. Second, the State Department should discuss its organizational
plans with counterpart agencies --- including the Departments of
Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce, Treasury, Justice, and Energy ---
something the last administration, according to the Government
Accountability Office, did not do. The National Security Council should
lead this discussion and specifically address whether federal agencies
are handling emerging technology policy with the kind of comprehensive
focus it requires, and not merely as an adjunct of cyber security.
Third, the new undersecretary should report to the third-ranking
official in the department, the deputy secretary for management and
resources, a position Congress should mandate that every administration
fill. Undersecretaries usually report to the secretary of state, but the
reality is that they do not all get equal attention. This alternative
structure would ensure consistent, high-level involvement. It would give
cyber diplomats the stature to go toe-to-toe with counterparts, both in
the U.S. policymaking process and in foreign governments, who would see
them as influential representatives of a powerful part of the State
Department. Organize for the Present, With a Clear View of the Future
[America faces a tidal wave of challenges wrought by unprecedented and
ubiquitous advances in **emerging technologies**]{.underline} and the
rise of China as an anti-democratic economic superpower. [[The State
Department has a **leading role**]{.mark} [to play]{.mark} in addressing
both challenges.]{.underline} Consolidating all technology issues under
a single undersecretary would significantly strengthen the department's
hand in the interagency policymaking process. [The department is better
positioned than its interagency counterparts to articulate a national
emerging technology policy that accounts for the full range of U.S.
national interests]{.underline}, not just those related to security.
**[[Multidimensionality is the]{.mark} [State]{.mark}
[Department's]{.mark} [core]{.mark} comparative
[advantage]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Consolidation would reinforce it.
[[No other agency]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [the mandate,]{.mark} the
[expertise]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the [credibility]{.mark} to compel
consideration of that vital perspective.]{.underline} [[Without
it,]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [risks]{.mark}
[undermining]{.mark} its complex geostrategic [interests with
**over-securitized responses**]{.mark}]{.underline} to rivalry with
China and the related, evolving challenges presented by the most rapid
technological change ever experienced in human history.

#### New State Department bureau solves [expertise]{.underline} and norm development on [emerging tech]{.underline}

**Bade 22** (Scott, tech and policy analyst @ Eurasia Group "Digital
diplomacy gets a reboot," Tech Crunch,
<https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/08/digital-diplomacy-gets-a-reboot/>)//BB

CDP \[[[Bureau of Cyberspace]{.mark} and Digital Policy]{.underline}\]
[[will have three policy buckets]{.mark}: [international cyber
security]{.mark}, [digital policy and digital
freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}. Each roughly corresponds to preexisting
competencies: the cyber coordinator office (created back in 2011), the
Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs and the Bureau of Democracy,
Human Rights and Labor, respectively. It will be run by a
yet-to-be-confirmed ambassador-at-large; in the meantime, career
diplomat Jennifer Bachus will run the team as principal deputy assistant
secretary. While the new bureau [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} deal with
the day-to-day, a separate special envoy position will also [be created
to [focus on]{.mark}]{.underline} more long-term issues around [emerging
and critical technologies like [**AI**, **quantum** and
**biotech**]{.mark}**nology**]{.underline}. Missing in action no more?
[The "decision to stand up a new bureau is an indicator of how seriously
\[the Biden administration\] sees these threats]{.underline}," Eileen
Donahoe, a former U.S. ambassador who now runs the Stanford Global
Digital Policy Incubator, tells me. "[[They understand the need]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} more thought [leadership and diplomatic
capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}." One sign of that seriousness is that
both offices will, for at least a year, report directly to Deputy
Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, the department's number two official.
This is a good thing, says Chris Painter, who was the Obama
administration's top diplomat on cyber issues. Sherman, he says, has a
long history with cyber issues and worked to integrate technology issues
at regional bureaus she ran earlier in her career. CDP will need that
high-level support. [[The State Department is]{.underline}]{.mark}
playing catch up, I'm told, and [[attempting]{.mark} [to bring its
expertise]{.mark} --- [diplomacy]{.mark} and knowledge of international
relations --- [to]{.mark} more technical
[policymakers]{.mark}]{.underline} at the Departments of Commerce,
Energy, and other agencies. The implication is clear: [State's voice has
been missing]{.underline} in the interagency process and opportunities
have been missed both [at home and abroad]{.underline}. For example, as
Nate Picarsic and Emily de la Bruyère have written, the U.S. has been
largely absent from the politics of the intergovernmental organizations
that are quietly setting the global standards of technology. As a result
the U.S. has ceded ground to others, especially Russia and China, but
even the European Union, with massive implications for who controls the
future of technology. And as new international entities emerge, like the
EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council or the Quad's technology working
group, [[the State Department needs to be able to coordinate and
advise]{.underline}]{.mark}. Under the Trump administration, you "had
good, talented people," working these issues, Painter tells me, "but no
one at the leadership level \[able\] both to deal with the White House
and senior counterparts and foreign counterparts. \[[[The new
bureau\]]{.mark} [helps fill that gap]{.mark}]{.underline}." "[This is a
real down payment by the department]{.underline}," says Yll Bajraktari,
a former national security official who is now the CEO of Special
Competitive Studies Project, an AI advocacy group. "[Integrating the
department's capacity for cybersecurity, digital infrastructure and
governance issues including internet freedom will help create a coherent
diplomatic strategy]{.underline}."

for aggressive cyber acts to state-sponsored APTs. State Department is

Group, lobbying for an internet of information freedom rather than
information control by states. Thus far, as one panelist emphasized,
[the State Department has not yet framed its cyber diplomacy efforts in
the realities of the cyber strategic environment. The State Department
can make strides in supporting Persistent Engagement by socializing
foreign service officers and diplomats, who are the face of diplomacy,

**Bergmann '21** (Max, senior fellow at the Center for American
Progress, "It's time to get the Pentagon out of the business of
administering U.S. foreign aid," Washington Post, March 11, 2021,

"[Diplomacy is back at the center of our foreign policy,"]{.underline}
President Biden announced last month in remarks that were heartening ---
and long overdue. [But rebuilding the State Department will require more
than just elevating career officials and building up a bigger and more
diverse diplomatic]{.underline} corps. [**[Shifting the center of power
to the State]{.mark} [Department requires putting diplomats]{.mark} back
[in charge]{.mark}** of U.S. foreign policy and empowering them with new
resources]{.underline}. To achieve this requires ending a byproduct of
the post-9/11 era: the Pentagon's foreign aid program. By law, foreign
aid, which includes assistance to foreign militaries, is the
responsibility of the State Department. This is for the simple reason
that providing arms to another country is fundamentally an act of
foreign policy. The State Department's foreign military financing
program has provided roughly \$6 billion aid annually to foreign
military partners, such as Israel and Egypt, for a half-century. But [in
the past two decades, the Defense Department has developed its own
security assistance program.]{.underline} This happened by accident, not
design. [A few small niche programs]{.underline} related to the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq gradually **[metastasized]{.underline}** into
larger and broader programs. The trend accelerated during the Obama
years. The government saw security assistance as a tool to help U.S.
partners cope with instability and terrorism in the Middle East and
Africa, Russian aggression in Europe, and China's bullying of its Asian
neighbors. [As the administration sought to fund these efforts, it found
that the St**ate Department couldn't get more money** from Congress to
create these programs]{.underline}. The 2011 Budget Control Act, which
President Barack Obama brokered with congressional Republicans, put hard
limits on government spending. [But [while]{.mark} [the State
Department's budget was capped]{.mark}, [the Defense]{.mark}
[Department's]{.mark} contingency [budget]{.mark} [was
not]{.mark}]{.underline}. That meant that the easiest way to fund new
security assistance endeavors was through the Pentagon. And the Obama
administration found it easier to get a Republican Congress to grant the
Pentagon the authorities necessary to provide assistance than it was to
get money for the State Department. Once this spigot opened, the
Pentagon's top brass --- led by combatant commanders eager to get
funding for their regions --- descended on Congress. The Pentagon was
granted billions in funding, and at least 56 of these new programs
required no coordination with the State Department. [The result today is
that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} [two]{.mark}
[distinct security]{.mark} assistance [systems]{.mark} --- one at [the
State Department]{.mark} [and]{.mark} one at the [Defense
Department]{.mark} --- **[doing the same thing]{.mark}**. [That]{.mark}
[has]{.mark} [created a bureaucratic mess]{.mark} involving countless
planning and operational conflicts --- one [that]{.mark} also
[makes]{.mark} [it **impossible for Congress to conduct**
]{.mark}**effective [oversight]{.mark}**, since the two departments
answer to different committees]{.underline}. Recognizing the problem,
some policymakers in Congress and the Pentagon have recently implemented
a few useful reforms --- but they go only so far. Today, when combatant
commanders show up in the countries they're assigned to, they frequently
have security assistance funding at their disposal. But State Department
officials of similar rank often lack comparably flexible funding and yet
have to deliver tough messages on other U.S. foreign policy priorities,
from human rights to economic reform, democratization or even climate
policy. This [power imbalance is not lost on foreign partners, and they
act accordingly, often tuning out the State Department while cultivating
their relations with the Defense Department. [The]{.mark} current
[bifurcated system]{.mark} [is **not just**]{.mark} **[wasteful]{.mark}
--- [it's]{.mark} also potentially [dangerous]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Policymakers originally expanded Defense Department assistance in
response to the post-9/11 focus on counterterrorism, when security
assistance was often seen as a technical tool to smooth collaboration
with foreign militaries. But [in a new era of global great power
competition, the provision of arms to another country sends a loud
foreign policy signal, one that can easily lead to miscalculation. Those
assistance decisions need to be well coordinated and calibrated by
diplomats, not generals.]{.underline}

[the U.S. can't afford]{.mark} for [parallel security-assistance]{.mark}
bureaucracies to undermine statecraft]{.underline}, he said. "[[What is

**what**]{.underline} the hell[**'s** going on]{.underline}," said
Bergmann, now a senior fellow at Center for American Progress.
Meanwhile, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on both
sides of the aisle are generally supportive of shifts, arguing for an
overhaul of the current setup. "[[As the **Defense**]{.mark} Department
continues **[efforts]{.mark}** to **[cut the]{.mark} [State Department
out of]{.mark}** [**security cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, we've
seen a greater focus on short-term tactical capabilities than on
sustainable forces aligned with strategic foreign policy," Risch said.
"We must address governance challenges like corruption in all our
activities, and we need to professionalize our security assistance
workforce."

#### Even if both policies are equally resourced, the Department of State will be pushed into the supporting role

Neither is Stavridis the first retired military leader to voice this
concern. In 2013, future secretary of defense James Mattis, then a
Marine Corps general, famously quipped, "[if you don't fund the State
Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition]{.underline}." In
2012, Karl Eikenberry, a retired lieutenant general and former
ambassador to Afghanistan, argued that [[the militarization of U.S.
foreign]{.mark} [policy]{.mark} [and]{.mark} an unequal
[investment]{.mark} [in the Defense]{.mark} [Department]{.mark} over
other departments **[result]{.mark}**]{.underline}ed [[in]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} [military becoming the "**starting and relief
pitcher**]{.mark} for a number of foreign policy problems]{.underline}."
In a speech at Kansas State University in 2010, Michael Mullen, former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, articulated his concern with the
Defense Department's increasing role in foreign policy: "My fear, quite
frankly, is that we aren't moving fast enough in this regard. U.S.
foreign policy is still too dominated by the military, too dependent
upon the generals and admirals who lead our major overseas commands.
It's one thing to be able and willing to serve as emergency responders;
quite another to always have to be the fire chief." In an earlier
interview, Mullen described a vicious cycle of policymakers turning to
the military and increasing funding to the Defense Department because
they have greater trust in military capability than in other agencies,
and this greater funding in turn makes the military even more capable
relative to other national security institutions. [Instead of correcting
a significant imbalance in resourcing national security capabilities,
policymakers just turn to the military to handle an increasing array of
missions]{.underline}. [[The military]{.mark} then [becomes the lead
while]{.mark} [other]{.mark} **[organizations find]{.mark} [themselves
in supporting roles]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### Militarism

#### The plan relies on military forces, which harms diplomacy and encourages escalation. 

**Early '11** (Billy, Lt Col, USAF, "IMPLICATIONS OF THE MILITARIZATION
OF US FOREIGN POLICY THROUGH SECURITY ASSISTANCE," A Research Report
Submitted to the Faculty, Air War College, 16 February 2011,
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1018707.pdf>)

After the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 (9/11), the United
States embarked on a global effort to fight terrorism. Lessons learned
from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq taught the US military the
critical importance of enabling other countries to protect themselves
from terrorist networks, preventing problems from becoming crises or
escalating into conflicts requiring greater US involvement.1 [While US
foreign policy supports building the capacity of foreign military forces
through State Department security assistance programs, the Department of
Defense (DOD) views these traditional avenues as too inflexible and slow
to respond to the rapidly changing global threat environment, and too
poorly funded to meet the growing security requirements]{.underline}. 2
DOD asked Congress to grant it the authority to train and equip foreign
military forces in countries around the world where US military leaders
saw urgent or emerging threats that could potentially harm US national
interests. In 2006 Congress granted the DOD the authority to build the
capacity of foreign military forces to conduct counterterrorism and
stability operations, making DOD the lead for a State Department foreign
policy responsibility. [Critics charge that this new
authority]{.underline}, known as Global Train and Equip, [militarizes US
foreign policy]{.underline}. [**[Using the US military]{.mark} [to build
the capacity]{.mark} [of foreign military forces]{.mark} [can]{.mark}
[militarize US foreign policy]{.mark} and possibly [harm]{.mark} [State
Department efforts]{.mark} [to advance American
intere]{.mark}**[sts]{.mark}]{.underline}. This paper analyses DOD's
Global Train [and]{.mark} Equip authority using three indicators to
determine if the militarization of foreign policy exists: (1) use of
military force, (2) rates of growth in military versus diplomatic
budgets, and (3) shifts of foreign policy functions to the military.
Indications of militarization of US foreign policy are then considered
against their overall effects on US foreign policy roles and
responsibilities to determine if US interests are harmed. The Global
Train and Equip authority militarizes US foreign policy by giving DOD a
greater diplomatic role in policy determination, but does not weaken the
State Department's ability to implement foreign policy or Congress's
oversight responsibilities. Furthermore, increased DOD involvement in
security assistance is a more responsive whole of government approach
and a proactive military strategy to respond to emerging threats and
shape the global security environment. **[Militarization of [Foreign
Policy]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[**Militarization**]{.mark}
[occurs]{.mark} [when a state **relies on the military**]{.mark} [to
pursue]{.mark} national [security objectives]{.mark} better achieved by
other means.]{.underline}3 [The DOD is criticized as having militarized
US foreign policy]{.underline} through its new authority to build the
capacity for foreign military forces to counter terrorism and support US
military and stability operations. [The controversy stems from the
direct funding and authority now given to DOD, not the State Department
which is responsible for US foreign assistance programs.]{.underline}
The continuation of this authority, going on its sixth year and already
costing more than \$1.2 billion, shifts responsibility away from the
State Department. [[Secretary]{.mark} [of Defense]{.mark} Gates even
[warns of a]{.mark} "**[creeping militarization]{.mark}"** of some
aspects of American's foreign policy]{.underline} when discussing the US
military's increased involvement in activities previously done by
civilian agencies, [[and cautions against an **overreliance on military
combat**]{.mark} **[operations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.4 [DOD involvement
in foreign policy may undermine US foreign policy
objectives.]{.underline} A shift in the core functions away from the
State Department may have undesirable effects for several reasons.
[First, it may weaken the State Department]{.underline}'s role in
implementing foreign policy. The State Department advances US interests
in foreign countries and its authority may be weakened if DOD is also
making decisions that impact US foreign policy[. Second, [**it may
weaken congressional oversigh**t,]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly
human rights protections, a large concern in many developing countries
around the world. Congress authorizes and funds State Department-managed
military assistance programs. [State Department support that goes
through the regular foreign assistance budget process is subject to
conditions and closely scrutinized. In contrast, support that goes
through the defense budget may receive far less review by foreign
oversight committees.]{.underline} [Third, [it gives **the**]{.mark}
[**Pentagon** a greater diplomatic role]{.mark} and significant autonomy
[over]{.mark} support to [foreign military forces]{.mark},
[which]{.mark} **[has the potential to cause stronger]{.mark}
[military-to-military ties]{.mark}** with a country than existing
diplomatic ties.]{.underline}5 These effects may harm US foreign policy
objectives. However, DOD involvement in US foreign assistance efforts is
not without precedence.

Plan To Reform U.S. Security Assistance," Center for American Progress
REPORT, MAR 9, 2021,
<https://www.americanprogress.org/article/plan-reform-u-s-security-assistance/>)-mikee

[U.S. **security assistance is broken**]{.underline} and in need of an
overhaul. Over the past two decades, the bureaucratic system developed
to deliver billions of dollars of [military aid]{.underline} to partner
nations [has]{.underline} evolved and [expanded]{.underline} not by
design but [as the result of a series of ad hoc legislative and policy
changes.]{.underline} Though the U.S. Department of State was initially
in charge of security assistance policy and accounts, since 9/11,
[the]{.underline} U.S. Department of Defense ([DOD) has established a
separate, well-funded security assistance bureaucracy at the
Pentagon.]{.underline} [This has **inhibited effective congressional
oversight, harmed** **coordination** between diplomacy and defense, and
contributed to **the growing militarization** of U.S. foreign
policy.]{.underline} [It has created a **dysfunctional** and bifurcated
security assistance system]{.underline}. [Under the current security
assistance system, the returns on America's security investments are
limited, inconsistent, and not strategic]{.underline}. The consequences
of today's broken system include [**increased reliance on the military
to solve** foreign policy challenges]{.underline}; a perpetuated status
quo whereby nondemocratic partners receive U.S. assistance and where
human rights abuses are ignored; and [an ineffective and unwieldy
bureaucracy.]{.underline} This matters because the United States depends
on capable allies and partners as a core component of its national
security strategy, but the current system is not suited to the task. [[A
new administration can change this by embracing wholesale reform]{.mark}
of the security assistance system]{.underline}. To do so, however[, a
Biden-Harris administration must move quickly to work with Congress and
include such reforms in any effort **[to rebuild and revive U.S.
diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This will require talking not only
about security assistance authorities, but fundamentally about money and
resources as well. Any reform efforts intending to bolster the role of
the State Department must start by examining how funding is oriented and
balanced between the departments. This necessitates close cooperation
with the Hill. There must be a dramatic realignment of U.S. security
assistance. This report provides an overview and a systemic critique of
the current bureaucratic structure of U.S. security assistance and
outlines how [[transferring resources and responsibilities for security
assistance back to the State Department will better advance U.S.
interests]{.mark} and address the current geopolitical challenges
America confronts.]{.underline} [It calls for [reviving the **centrality
of diplomacy by restoring the State Department's role,**]{.mark} as
originally intended under U.S. law, as the overseer of all U.S. foreign
assistance]{.underline}. It also offers recommendations for expanding
and training the security assistance workforce, improving interagency
coordination, elevating human rights concerns in security assistance
policy, and adapting best practices from the DOD. Specifically, this
report calls for transferring the following programs and funding from
the DOD to the State Department: The relatively newly created Section
333 train and equip authority, which replicates the State Department's
Foreign Military Financing (FMF) authority The DOD's security assistance
authorities that focus on long-term security force reform to the State
Department, including the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, the
Counter-Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Train and Equip Fund, and
the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative fund [This would result in a
roughly \$7 billion transfer, significantly augmenting the State
Department's budget and capacity to guide security assistance
policy.]{.underline} Putting the State Department back in charge of
security assistance will be a major reform and will require significant
operational changes within the department, as well as a dramatic
expansion of its administrative capacity. This will take time to
implement and require significant reform within the agency. The DOD has
done an admirable job in setting up a new institutional structure, in
implementing assistance, and in coordinating with the State Department.
However, officials across the U.S. foreign policy world acknowledge that
the system is not working. Tommy Ross, a former DOD official in charge
of overseeing the Pentagon's security assistance, recently argued that
U.S. security assistance is "not fit for purpose" and is "out of sync
with U.S. priorities when it comes to where resources are needed most
and the types of capabilities required by America's allied and
partners."1 Indeed, throughout much of the last decade, it has been DOD
officials who publicly argued for increased funding for the State
Department.2 Ultimately, [the current bifurcated security assistance
system is suboptimal and results in the bureaucratic diminishment of the
State Department relative to the military considerations of the
DOD.]{.underline} [Transferring resources and responsibility to the
State Department would **centralize responsibility** for foreign aid
under diplomatic control, while **improving interagency cooperation**,
as DOD would remain the primary implementer of U.S.
assistance]{.underline}. Some of these ideas will likely be met with
innate skepticism from a generation of security professionals whose
experience in [Washington has been characterized by an ever-withering
State Department and an ever-strengthening Pentagon]{.underline}. This
report anticipates and rebuts likely arguments against reform, including
the capacity of the State Department to take on this responsibility, the
benefits of the Pentagon's current management, or the unnecessary
disruption that would result from significant bureaucratic change laid
out in this proposal. [[Failing to reform security assistance not only
leaves the United States with a wasteful and inefficient status quo, it
also perpetuates the **marginalization of diplomacy and locks in the
military's newly found dominance** in driving U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. The current security assistance system
evolved to address the threats posed by the post-9/11 era and is now
outdated and ill-suited for a new geopolitical environment characterized
by competition. If the next administration is to revive U.S. diplomacy
and rebuild the State Department, it must empower the agency to oversee
and direct foreign assistance. The Biden-Harris administration should
seize the opportunity to work with a new Congress to reform the system
from its first days in office and restore an effective tool in the U.S.
foreign policy arsenal. A new security assistance system, centralized
and coordinated within the State Department, would allow the United
States to wield its security assistance more effectively and responsibly
in today's competitive geopolitical environment. Arms transfers,
training, and support could also better support U.S. foreign policy
goals, in particular bolstering democratic partners and emerging
democracies, making them stronger U.S. partners to counter threats from
authoritarian actors. [[Empowering the State Department]{.mark} to
oversee and manage security assistance would also ensure that aid is
used to advance a values-based foreign policy that respects and supports
human rights]{.underline}.3 [It [would also give U.S. diplomats greater
clout and leverage and potentially create greater coherence to the
provision of foreign assistance overall. The result would be to
strengthen a key tool in the U.S. foreign policy toolbox and increase
the clout and authority of America's diplomats, which is badly needed in
this new era of geopolitical competition.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[DIPLOMACY has never been so important as now]{.underline}, when we are
confronting the most serious crises since the Second World War: the
global pandemic and economic collapse. When we emerge finally from the
grip of the coronavirus, Americans will need to account for a
public-health disaster that has killed well over 100,000 people to date
and shuttered nearly every institution in our society (including
Harvard) for much of the spring and into the summer. But [we'll also
need to look beyond our borders]{.underline} to assess what went wrong
globally. Why did the World Health Organization---its long and
continuing record of expertise in matters of global health
notwithstanding---not press China more aggressively to tell the truth
about the virus in early January? [How should nations be better
prepared]{.underline} for a possible second wave? Can they agree to
share a vaccine equitably among the world's 7.7 billion people?
[Will]{.underline} the [major economies collaborate]{.underline} to
prevent the current recession from turning into another Great
Depression? [The answer to these questions will depend]{.underline} in
large measure **[on]{.underline}** **[our ability to work diplomatically
across the world]{.underline}** in this multi-front struggle. As a
former career Foreign Service officer, I have spent four decades of my
professional life representing the United States overseas and teaching
about America's role as the indispensable power in the international
arena. For much of that time, [the nation leaned heavily on its
unmatched military might]{.underline}---[during the Cold War, after
9/11, and in the Afghan and Iraq wars. **Now**]{.underline}, with the
spread of the coronavirus to every inhabited continent, **[[diplomacy's
time has]{.mark} [come in the reconstruction of a more stable and better
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Unfortunately, restoring the role of U.S.
diplomacy won't be easy. One early casualty of the pandemic is our
plummeting credibility as the unmatched global power. For the first time
since World War II, America has chosen not to lead in confronting a
quintessentially global threat. With American energy and confidence in
short supply, President Donald Trump is a spectral figure on the world
stage as nations struggle to contain the virus. Instead of leading the
G-20 major economies against the contagion, the world has watched an
American president castigate China for birthing the "Wuhan Virus," pin
the blame for the failed response on the World Health Organization,
and---as one of my European students lamented---fail even to offer a
simple word of sympathy in all those endless news conferences to those
dying in Italy and Spain and other bedrock allies. Former Secretary of
State Colin Powell has long maintained that [America should place its
diplomats out in front]{.underline} ("on point" in the military
vernacular), [with]{.underline} the [armed forces]{.underline} in
reserve, [to be used only when diplomacy fails]{.underline}. Powell's
dictum is an important reminder of how the United States should seek to
lead in this time of pandemic, for the [coronavirus is only one of many
among a new type of threat that requires us to **lead**]{.underline} as
much **[through]{.underline}** the power of **[diplomacy]{.underline}**
as through that of the military. Many of the students I teach point to
[transnational [threats]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [affect]{.mark}
[every]{.mark} [nation]{.mark}]{.underline} and person on earth as our
greatest challenges: [**[climate change]{.underline}**, **[food and
water shortages]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[[narcotics and crime]{.mark}
[cartels]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the lack of **[[cyber
security]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
**[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}** top the list. [[We cannot
succeed]{.mark} [in containing]{.mark} them
[without]{.mark}]{.underline} forming **[[diplomatic
alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}** among governments, universities,
foundations, businesses, and citizens. This new brand of diplomacy is
not an alternative to the military but its logical partner in the
twenty-first century American arsenal. The military remains essential to
fight terrorists, and to counter rivals Russia and China and outlaw
governments in North Korea and Iran, but even in these cases we have to
have robust diplomacy to achieve our aims. Even if we deployed the full
might of the U.S. military to eliminate the North Korean and Iranian
nuclear programs, and the regimes that support them, does anyone believe
that would, by itself, "solve" the problem? Even in those cases, deft,
multilateral diplomacy will have to play a lead role---as recent
experience has shown. **[We can no longer default to force
alone]{.underline}**, as we have done so often since 9/11. A Foreign
Service for 2030 AMERICA'S DIPLOMATIC EFFECTIVENESS rests, in large
part, on the women and men of the U.S. Foreign Service---more than
11,000 career officials in more than 280 embassies and consulates and at
the State Department in Washington, D.C. They are our primary interface
with foreign governments, businesses, and citizens. They adjudicate
immigrant and non-immigrant visas and refugee admissions to the United
States. They help American businesses overcome barriers to foreign trade
and investment. They manage difficult war and peace challenges in every
corner of the world---from daily challenges to the most intricate,
strategic matters vital to our national security and prosperity.
Diplomatic collaboration also underpins our ability to advance the more
positive scientific, technological, and societal trends that can sustain
the historic alleviation of poverty worldwide, promote women's rights,
and realize the promise of a carbon-free economy. Just when we need to
turn to diplomacy, however, the Foreign Service is experiencing one of
the greatest crises in its long history. Some of the damage has been
caused by prior Democratic as well as Republican administrations. The
United States is the only major country that fills a third or more of
its ambassadorial assignments with political appointees, often poorly
qualified, from outside the career ranks---often depriving the country
of the advantages it could secure with expert, professional, nonpartisan
diplomatic representation around the world. That mistake has only
accelerated, with the current administration appointing the lowest
percentage of career ambassadors in more than half a century. Former
generals and admirals have been appointed to ambassadorships that would
otherwise be filled---as they should be---by civilian officers. The
politicization and militarization of our foreign policy by both parties
is a genuine problem. More broadly, the Foreign Service has been
substantially weakened and is in need of major repair. Even as the Trump
administration's budget requests for the Department of Defense rose from
\$686 billion to as high as \$718 billion during its first two years, it
sought to slash the State Department's budget by up to a third. The
administration fired several of America's most senior and experienced
diplomats early in 2017 and sidelined countless others, triggering an
exodus of officers of every rank. The president himself has castigated
career diplomats as the "Deep State." Unsurprisingly, morale has crashed
and young Americans' applications for the Foreign Service have fallen to
just under 10,000 from a high of 31,000 in 2003---a worrisome indicator
that our nation's ability to attract superb diplomatic talent is being
eroded. Re-Imagining American Diplomacy THE KENNEDY SCHOOL launched an
ambitious, nonpartisan initiative this winter---A New American Diplomacy
for the 21st Century---to address these concerns and spark a national
conversation about the future of the Foreign Service. I am working with
former Foreign Service colleagues, Ambassadors Nancy McEldowney, Marc
Grossman, and Marcie Ries, to issue a major public report after the
November presidential election. We have organized online meetings with
hundreds of current and former officials, business and nonprofit
leaders, and everyday citizens to discuss ways to strengthen the career
service. American diplomacy needs a major generational update. Since
9/11, Congress and three administrations have reformed the U.S. military
and intelligence services and created the Department of Homeland
Security. But collectively, they did little to re-imagine diplomacy's
role in the American arsenal. During the last century, there have been
just three efforts to modernize the U.S. diplomatic corps: in 1924,
1946, and 1980 (when Congress passed the last major State Department
Authorization Act). In our vastly altered geo-strategic environment, 40
years later, it is time to renew the mission of the Foreign Service.
Barack Obama, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Mahmoud Abbas, September 22, 2009,
at the Waldorf Astoria, New York City Photograph by John
Angelillo-Pool/Getty Images We can mine America's long diplomatic
history for inspiration. Drawing on my own experience, I recall, as a
young intern at the U.S. embassy in Mauritania, seeing first-hand the
respect and influence President Jimmy Carter earned as the first U.S.
leader to make Africa a priority. A decade later, when I served at the
National Security Council with responsibility for the Soviet Union, I
witnessed President George H.W. Bush negotiate the peaceful end of the
Cold War and Bill Clinton consolidate the triumph of democracy over
communism. President George W. Bush launched the bipartisan PEPFAR
initiative to help in the fight against HIV/AIDs, polio, malaria, and
other deadly diseases in Africa, the Caribbean, and elsewhere (a useful
precedent when thinking about what it will really take to combat the
coronavirus, not only in the developed nations, but in those with far
fewer economic and healthcare resources). It was on 9/11, however, as
U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, that I
learned one of the most powerful lessons about diplomacy. Just a few
hours after Al Qaida terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and
Pentagon, my phone started to ring at NATO headquarters outside
Brussels. My Canadian colleague, David Wright, called first---followed
by the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, France, Poland, Germany,
Italy, and many others. Each asked, "What can we do to help?" Those were
very welcome words on the single darkest day in recent American history.
By the next morning, invoking Article 5 of the 1949 NATO Treaty for the
first time in history, all of the NATO-allied countries came to the
rescue of the United States---lending mighty political and diplomatic
support to the military response that would come later. Our allies
considered Osama Bin Laden's attacks on New York and Washington as an
attack on them as well. Their militaries all went into Afghanistan with
us (the majority remain 19 years later---and they and other partner
nations have suffered more than 1,000 combat deaths; we owe them a lot).
Contrary to such evidence, the current president believes the United
States is strongest when it acts alone---unburdened of allies and
partners whom he views as relics of our Cold War past. I lived the
history of 9/11 and draw a very different lesson about the value of
allies to the United States. Why would we want to live alone in a
troubled and dangerous world, without the benefit of friends and allies
by our side? [Our [NATO allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as Japan,
South Korea, and Australia, [[act as multipliers]{.mark} [of American
power]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}. They provide a lifeline of
military, economic, and political support when we often need it most.
They represent the great power differential between the United States
and our rivals Russia and China, who can count on no such allies when
the chips are down. As we recover from two decades of war and COVID-19's
assault on our society and economy, we will need to look at our global
role in a new way. The era when America could run the world by fiat has
vanished. We are still the strongest economic, military, and
technological power---but China, India, and others are gaining on us. We
can no longer overpower our adversaries in every crisis. [And although
we will need to call on the military to defend us in the future, [we
will more]{.mark} [often]{.mark} than not [need to outwit]{.mark} and
outmaneuver [adversaries]{.mark} [through]{.mark}]{.underline} the
strength of our **[[diplomats]{.underline}]{.mark}** and our
alliances---not to mention mustering support for those broader,
nonmilitary crises we now face, **[from pandemics to climate
change]{.underline}**.

#### Harms democratic progress and enables human rights violators

[**Harms democratic progress and enables human rights violators**
[Current]{.mark} [security assistance
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} divorced from other foreign aid
considerations, [[hampers]{.mark} pursuing this [values-based
policy]{.mark} [and does not]{.mark} effectively [elevate]{.mark}
[h]{.mark}uman [r]{.mark}ights [and democracy concerns]{.mark} in the
decision-making process]{.underline}. This is dangerous because the
United States ends up supporting autocratic regimes with serious
governance and stability challenges. Yemen, for example, received more
than \$300 million in security assistance through the DOD's train and
equip authority between 2010 and 2015, yet researchers documented human
rights abuses perpetrated by the government and possible diversion of
U.S. aid.67 Worse still, the perception that U.S. aid was fueling
conflict led much of the Yemeni public to believe that the United States
was primarily responsible for the destruction of the Saudi-led coalition
in the current war.68 Today, the conflict in Yemen is the world's worst
humanitarian crisis. **[[An overly militarized security]{.mark}
[assistance]{.mark} [policy makes it harder to]{.mark} [support emerging
democracies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[Building]{.mark} [up]{.mark}
[security]{.mark} forces [without]{.mark} accompanying [reforms to
strengthen]{.mark} civilian [oversight]{.mark} can [lead]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} coup-proofing or [consolidation around a political
leader]{.mark}, rather than the development of a competent
force]{.underline}.69 Often, these impacts are not prioritized by
security assistance practitioners; for example, the DOD's relative
spending on building up partner security institutions, such as the
Defense Institution Reform Initiative, was \$32.6 million in fiscal year
2019, compared with \$1.9 billion of overall spending.70 At the same
time, the DOD's investment in institutional capacity building far
exceeds the State Department's investment in these efforts---an example
where the State Department will have to incorporate and improve on the
DOD's practices. While U.S. laws technically prohibit providing security
assistance to units found to violate human rights---the Leahy laws---the
provisions are riddled with loopholes and are too weak to effectively
prioritize human rights in U.S. security assistance.71 Offices and
agencies responsible for elevating human rights in U.S. foreign policy,
such as the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and
Labor, are too often cut out of the decision-making process for security
assistance programs---especially those run out of the Pentagon. At the
same time, [the Pentagon maintains its own security assistance accounts,
such as Section 127e, that are not required to conduct human rights
vetting and operate with little transparency---furthering opportunities
to militarize foreign]{.underline} policy.72 And often, such as in the
case of Egypt, security assistance is accompanied by paltry amounts of
democracy, human rights, and governance funding (DRG), or certifications
on human rights are waived entirely, to make providing arms more
palatable.73 [These small DRG funds or certification stops do little to
change the underlying political challenges or are sometimes even
hampered by the regime the United States is funding.]{.underline}

However, [reducing the United States' emphasis on a values-driven
foreign policy is wrong, and contrary to the strategic interests of the
United States]{.underline}. **[[Democracy]{.mark}
[promotion]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in particular [serves a **key role
in**]{.mark} **[safeguarding U.S. interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark} promoting [global]{.mark}, long-term [growth]{.mark} in
ways fundamentally compatible with U.S. strategic
interests.]{.underline} After all, **[[democracies protect private
property]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in important ways, **[invest in]{.mark}
[public goods]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [are more politically stable,
[make]{.mark} for **more [dependable]{.mark}
[allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} empirically **[do not go
to]{.mark} [war]{.mark} with one another**]{.underline}. Ultimately, a
world full of democratic governments is safer, more prosperous, and more
stable --- all states of being that the United States has an interest in
promoting. [[Democracy]{.mark} guarantees that the public has a stake in
its own institutions and government, which [leads to **investor
confidence and growth**]{.mark}. Since elected politicians are
accountable to property owners and are held in check by an independent
judiciary, democracies tend to have better mechanisms for **protecting
private property**]{.underline} [than their autocratic counterparts.
This makes democracies a **particularly attractive type of country for
investors** --- both public and private --- because checks and balances
make it difficult for the state to nationalize industries]{.underline}.
Further, [[private]{.mark} [property]{.mark} [rights]{.mark} protected
by the legal system **[encourage entrepreneurship]{.mark} [and small
business development]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [both of [which are **key
to a growing and modernizing economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a
result, [democracies tend to be wealthier and more economically stable
than their autocratic counterparts.]{.underline} This is fundamentally
in the interest of the United States in that both private and public
investors have an interest in seeing returns on their investments,
[[thereby]{.mark} potentially [making]{.mark} **[countries less]{.mark}
[willing to go to war if that]{.mark} [would]{.mark} [require]{.mark}
[severing economic ties]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Democratic institutions
ensure that citizens with both economic and political power are heard.
[Democracies also **invest in public goods at much higher rates than
autocratic governments**]{.underline}. [[Because]{.mark}
[politicians]{.mark} [must cater to]{.mark} [the]{.mark} median
[voter]{.mark}, [they **approve policies that**]{.mark} **[invest in
public education and healthcare]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [both of which
promote long-term growth and development]{.underline}. Public education
invests in a country's human capital, setting the stage for long-term
innovation, adaptability, and advancement. [Public healthcare,
meanwhile, has been shown [to **increase overall societal
productivity**]{.mark} and well-being as people take fewer sick days,
citizens are able to afford their healthcare without going bankrupt, and
ultimately, the overall **[costs of healthcare are driven down]{.mark}**
as citizens become healthier]{.underline}. Productive, innovative
societies are also better for the United States --- [innovation around
the world improves global quality of life, results in more educational
and vocational opportunities for Americans]{.underline} (both because
other universities and jobs become more attractive to Americans who want
to go abroad and because potential immigrants are more likely to want to
stay in their own country, opening up opportunities for U.S. citizens at
home), [and may reduce friction between countries over resources and
labor]{.underline}. [Democracies are also generally more politically
stable because regular election cycles ensure an established process for
the habitual and peaceful removal of leaders from power.]{.underline}
[[Elections]{.mark} ensure the non-violent transition of power and
reduce the need for mass protest, rioting, and revolution --- which
**[makes]{.mark} [countries more politically]{.mark}
[stable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Further, when citizens are granted
rights and protections from government abuse, enforced by an independent
judiciary, they have fewer grievances against the government and are
thus less able to mobilize large numbers of people to violently
overthrow the regime. [[Revolution]{.mark}, while not always violent,
often [leads to]{.mark} political instability, challenges to growth,
**[increased incentives for]{.mark} [diversionary war and
conflict]{.mark}**, and oftentimes civil war]{.underline}. The
externalities of civil war and international conflict then put pressure
on the United States to intervene, protect human rights, and otherwise
expend resources on other countries' issues. [Further, civil wars are
highly destructive to institutions, human capital, and resources, and
can have significant security spillover effects, increasing global risk
of political instability and **violent extremism**]{.underline}. [This
[political]{.mark} [stability]{.mark}, in addition to institutional
checks and balances, [makes **democracies better international
partners**]{.mark} **and allies in the long-term**]{.underline}.
Treaties ratified by multiple branches of government are more durable
than executive agreements signed by a single leader who may be replaced
within a short period of time. [While democracies may be more reluctant
to commit to alliances and formal security pacts, once a party to them,
they are more dependable than other states with concentrated power at
the executive level]{.underline}. **[These kind of durable commitments
are of interest to the United States as it seeks to preserve the liberal
world order]{.underline}**; [it is far more effective to ally with
partners whose institutions make withdrawal from the alliance
costly]{.underline}. Finally, [it has been empirically observed that
**democracies do not go to war with one another**]{.underline}. While
there is a robust debate around the exact nature of the so-called
"democratic peace," it [appears that [there are qualities particular to
democracies]{.mark} [that]{.mark} make war between them particularly
unlikely: a **dovish public [constrains]{.mark} [leaders' ability to
wage war]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [competitive elections and a free press
make it **easier to credibly communicate resolve to potential
adversaries**]{.underline}, [consolidated democracies tend to be **more
wealthy and economically interdependent**]{.underline}, [like-minded
people are more hesitant to wage war against one another, and so
on]{.underline}. Regardless of the precise mechanisms, however, a [world
of democracies is inherently safer, more prosperous, and less likely to
initiate a war against the United States --- a key factor in protecting
American security and interests]{.underline}.

[**Contributes to the militarization of foreign policy** The current
security assistance system contributes to the militarization of U.S.
foreign policy]{.underline}. Militarizing foreign policy entails the
increasing use of the military to solve foreign policy challenges and
results in a bloated DOD budget with more resources and authority.
Researchers describe it as a phenomenon whereby "the military more and
more becomes the primary actor and face of U.S. policy abroad," leading
to a cycle in which the DOD requires and receives significantly more
resources than any other foreign policy agency and is thus increasingly
relied on to solve U.S. foreign policy problems.62 There are several
elements of a militarized foreign policy in today's security assistance
system, but primarily, the DOD's control of significantly more security
assistance resources puts the Pentagon---rather than diplomats---in the
driver's seat in policymaking. The Pentagon's significant resources also
distort the face of U.S. security assistance on the ground. Gordon
Adams, a former White House budget official, warned, [**"[Who owns the
ball matters]{.mark}** here because it colors the way the U.S. engages
overseas]{.underline}. [[If American engagement]{.mark} [wears a
uniform]{.mark} ... that's one form of interaction[. If it involves the
ambassador]{.mark} and the]{.underline} \[U.S. Agency for International
Development[\] and people doing governance work, [it's a different set
of missions]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [there's a **hugely different
perception**]{.mark}]{.underline}."63 Recipient countries can utilize
this to their advantage; foreign officials may more eagerly seek to
follow through or make progress on DOD requests or priorities, such as
going through with a significant military exercise or a ship visit,
while ignoring or slow-rolling State Department requests or priorities,
such as releasing a dissident or altering an economic regulation. And if
the interlocutor that matters in relations with the United States is the
military, the subject that matters is defense. The Pentagon's priorities
can therefore end up carrying more importance with partners than the
State Department's broader foreign policy concerns, making combatant
commands more powerful than any diplomat. [When the State Department is
deprived of resources, or cut out of the decision-making process
entirely, diplomats cannot effectively weigh in on whether a proposed
sale or package makes sense given a range of other nonmilitary concerns
that may exist in a bilateral relationship. In short, [money is
power]{.mark}, [and the DOD has the money]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[The
net effect is]{.mark} [that U.S. foreign policy is less
coherent]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with Pentagon policy more likely to be
out of sync with broader foreign policy concerns. For example, the DOD's
U.S. Africa Command posture review is being conducted with little to no
coordination with the State Department, and the rumored outcome is to
call for reduced U.S. presence and security investments in order to free
up DOD resources to focus on competition with Russia and China.64 Yet
[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates still [has]{.mark} [serious]{.mark}
[security]{.mark} and geopolitical [interests]{.mark} in the continent
[that are]{.mark} likely [not reflected]{.mark} [in]{.mark} traditional
[military]{.mark}-only [decision-making]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rachel
Stohl, managing director at the Stimson Center, warned that developing
military-to-military security assistance programs is "an important
relationship, one that should be cultivated, but it is not separate from
the diplomatic and foreign policy relationships that have to be
developed and take time. If you lose the foreign policy piece and just
focus on the security piece, you're doing a disservice to the larger
strategic objectives."65 T[he siloed [security]{.mark}
[assistance]{.mark} [system]{.mark} [leads]{.mark} [to
disjointed]{.mark} [U.S. foreign policy]{.mark}, divorces security
concerns from broader economic or diplomatic concerns, [and]{.mark} can
[end]{.mark} [up promoting militarized solutions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Even if the counterplan seems like a minor distinction, it has a crucial bearing on how assistance is executed and perceived

[**[Why Does It Matter]{.mark}** [Whether Defense or]{.mark} [State
Controls Military Aid Programs]{.mark}? The question of whether military
aid and training programs should be funded by the Defense Department or
the State Department may seem, at first glance, to be a subject more
suited to civics textbooks than public debate]{.underline}. [Yet
[the]{.mark} [outcome]{.mark} of this debate [will have a **crucial
bearing**]{.mark} **[on how U.S. power is exercised]{.mark} [and
projected]{.mark} around the world**]{.underline}. [Let's take a look at
some examples from Latin America]{.underline}. n In 2006-2007, the
congressional foreign operations subcommittees, which govern only State
Department-funded military aid, learned about killings of civilians and
other human rights violations by the Colombian army, which receives a
annual military aid package. Responding to the subcommittees' concerns,
which invoked conditions in the foreign aid law, the State Department
was forced to withhold temporarily \$110 million worth of aid and
training. More importantly, [[the State Department]{.mark} [had to ask
the Colombian]{.mark} [government]{.mark} [to]{.mark} take steps to
[curb killings]{.mark} of civilians by the army [and]{.mark} to
[increase]{.mark}]{.underline} so-far glacial [[progress]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} investigating and [prosecuting]{.mark} members of the armed
forces credibly alleged to have committed crimes such as torture,
murder, or collaborating with brutal illegal paramilitary
forces]{.underline}. Only 25% of State Department- funded aid was
subject to these conditions, so the overall aid program was not strongly
affected, but [human rights concerns played a more prominent role in the
U.S.-Colombian government dialogue]{.underline}. [On the other hand,
[all military aid through]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [Defense]{.mark}
[Department]{.mark} [continued]{.mark} to flow]{.underline} during this
time period, [and no visible sign of any concern about human rights
abuses emerged from]{.underline} the Armed Services Committees or
[Defense]{.underline} Appropriations subcommittees, which govern the aid
flowing through the Defense Department. [[Had most military]{.mark}
[aid]{.mark} and training [flowed through the defense]{.mark}
[bill]{.mark}, [the U.S. government's voice]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
[h]{.mark}uman [r]{.mark}ights [would have dropped to a
whisper]{.mark}]{.underline}.4

#### The plan creates the perception of the US as a military-focused hegemon, the counterplan promotes a more peaceful diplomatic-focused perception

**Withers et al '8** (George, WOLA Senior Fellow focused on human rights
in Latin America, "Ready, Aim, Foreign Policy," WOLA, March,
https://www.wola.org/sites/default/files/downloadable/Regional%20Security/past/LAWG-Combo-ForeignPolicy-6.pdf)

[Why]{.underline}, one might ask, [shouldn't the military budget be the
source of U.S. military aid overseas? The short answer is that
[equipping]{.mark} and training [the world's armies]{.mark} [is a
**major foreign policy**]{.mark} **[decision]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
example, [[The]{.mark} [choice]{.mark} [to]{.mark} train and
[equip]{.mark} foreign [militaries]{.mark} [is perceived as a U.S.
**endorsement**]{.mark} of those militaries. The relative balance of
economic and military aid to a country affects perceptions about how the
United States chooses to project its power]{.underline}. Strengthening a
military can affect the balance of power within a geographic region, and
within a country. [[The association of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [with a particular military]{.mark}, [especially one
engaged in h]{.mark}uman [r]{.mark}ights [violations]{.mark},
[affects]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [image]{.mark} of our country. [Instead
of]{.mark} the]{.underline} regional and [[diplomatic
considerations]{.mark} which concern the State Department, [the Defense
Department's]{.mark} [assigned]{.mark} [mission requires it to adopt
a]{.mark} **[military focus]{.mark}** on potential national security
threats]{.underline}. [[Military training]{.mark} and aid decisions, as
a significant part of foreign policy, [should be governed by the agency
in charge of **foreign policy and diplomacy**]{.mark}---**[the]{.mark}
[State Department]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And they should be overseen by

#### Security cooperation includes DOS activities.

**Early '11** (Billy, Lt Col, USAF, "IMPLICATIONS OF THE MILITARIZATION
OF US FOREIGN POLICY THROUGH SECURITY ASSISTANCE," A Research Report
Submitted to the Faculty, Air War College, 16 February 2011,
https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1018707.pdf)-mikee

**[Security Cooperation]{.underline}** The US military shapes the global
security environment and safeguards US interests through military
engagement with foreign militaries. Since the fall of the Soviet Union,
threats to US security have shifted from a two-power major theater war
to regional, ethnic, and religious conflicts. To counter these threats,
the US military found it necessary to interact with foreign militaries
using special operations forces which are best suited to handle these
new relationsbuilding efforts.11 Therefore, in 1991 Congress granted DOD
direct authority for special operations forces to train with foreign
militaries.12 Seeing benefit from building these relationships, the US
military continued to promote its engagement strategy which shifted
towards working with new and emerging democracies. In 1998 DOD
institutionalized planning for military engagements by requiring
geographic combatant commanders to publish Theater Engagement Plans.13
Military engagement maintained a narrow, regional focus until former
[Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld introduced Security Cooperation Guidance
in 2003 to unify guidance and prioritize department
efforts]{.underline}. Today's DOD guidance reflects changes since 2005
requiring all combatant commanders to publish engagement plans and
outlining [a broad range of peacetime activities]{.underline} that [fall
under DOD security cooperation efforts]{.underline}. [These include all
DOD funded engagements with foreign militaries such as combined
exercises, training, and education, military-to-military contacts,
humanitarian assistance, and information operations]{.underline}.
**[Security cooperation also includes security assistance programs which
fall under State Department funding and policy direction]{.underline}**,
[namely]{.underline} Foreign Military Sales and Foreign Military
Financing ([FMS/FMF]{.underline}) and International Military Education
and Training ([IMET]{.underline}).14 After 9/11 security cooperation
efforts grew rapidly mostly due to DOD activities in Iraq and
Afghanistan, but threats from global terrorism necessitated significant
changes be made to US security assistance efforts.

### No Solvency

#### Diplomatic assistance causes political backlash\-\--that wrecks solvency

**Kralev '20** (Nicholas, Executive Director @ the Washington
International Diplomatic Academy (WIDA), "Why Politicians Don't Trust
Diplomats,"
<https://diplomaticacademy.us/2020/06/14/kralev-why-politicians-dont-trust-diplomats/)//BB>

[So politicians' lack of trust in the Foreign Service is based on
perceptions that are largely divorced from reality]{.underline}. Like
most Americans, [they know very little about our diplomats]{.underline}.
In a challenge to such a conclusion, previous administrations have often
pointed to entrusting a few senior Foreign Service officers, including
William J. Burns and Thomas R. Pickering, with top State Department
posts as an example of the respective president's reliance on
professionals. That may speak of these officers' capabilities, but it
doesn't make up for sidelining or ignoring the service as an
institution. At least Bush and Obama understood that having held a
prominent position under an administration of the other party is also a
part of a career diplomat's job. For example, Bush appointed R. Nicholas
Burns ambassador to NATO and later undersecretary of state, even though
Burns had been State Department spokesman under Clinton. And Obama
appointed Victoria Nuland an assistant secretary of state despite her
earlier role as a close adviser to Dick Cheney, Bush's vice president.
In contrast, Trump has retaliated against officers who held key
positions during the Obama administration. [Politicians' **decades-long
distrust** of the Foreign Service has significantly undermined the
authority of the **professionals and ultimately weakened U.S. diplomacy
globally**]{.underline}. [The very real danger that there won't be
enough properly trained diplomats to **restore America's clout in the
future worries us**]{.underline} at the independent Washington
International Diplomatic Academy. So much so that, although we were set
up to offer short-term courses, we've decided to start a one-year
post-graduate practical training program for people who aspire to become
diplomats --- the first such effort outside government. Our instructors,
all former senior Foreign Service officers, have a lot to teach.

### Department of State Fails

#### The Department of State is structurally inept and incapable at effective diplomacy

**Zeya** and Finer **20**, \*American diplomat who has served as the
Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human
Rights in the Biden Administration since July 2021, \*\*American
journalist and diplomat who serves as Deputy National Security Advisor
under National Security Advisor (Uzra and Jon, "Revitalizing the State
Department and American Diplomacy," *Council Special Report* No. 89)//BB

It has become an article of faith among policymakers that principled
American leadership has waned but remains in demand around the world.
Moreover, America's network of international relationships is its
foremost strategic asset, even as the agency charged with advancing U.S.
interests through diplomacy---[the Department of State]{.underline}
(DOS)--- [has fallen into a deep and sustained period of
crisis]{.underline}. However, there is a third framing assumption: that
the current crisis offers an opportunity to address this predicament and
revitalize American diplomacy. Despite the decades-long failure to
implement essential reforms---and even in the face of sustained
hostility from the current administration---diplomacy remains the best
tool the United States has to advance its foreign policy interests. [The
role of the State Department has received heightened attention amid the
onslaught it has suffered under]{.underline} the Donald J.
[Trump]{.underline} administration, [which has treated American
diplomats and diplomacy with a mix of neglect and disdain. But many of
the challenges facing the DOS have existed for **decades**]{.underline}.
[Deficits in diversity, institutional culture, and professionalization
are **endemic** to the State Department as an institution, and a
diminished policy role for career officials persisted under previous
administrations]{.underline}. Too often, leaders from both major parties
have taken public support for U.S. leadership in the world for granted
without making a strong enough case to the American public for why it is
essential. Concrete steps can, and should, be taken solely through
executive action in the first year of an administration committed to
revitalizing American diplomacy, with thought to cementing change
through legislation. [The most pressing challenges facing the State
Department include a twenty-first-century policy environment that has,
in some priority areas, evolved beyond the core competencies of most
Foreign and Civil Service officers and an institution **hollowed out**
by three years of **talent flight**, **mired** in excessively layered
structure, and **resistant to reform**]{.underline}. Perhaps most
important, [they include the multigenerational challenge of a diplomatic
workforce that falls woefully short of reflecting the diverse country it
serves, particularly at the senior-most ranks, compromising its
effectiveness and fostering a homogeneous and risk-averse culture that
drives out rather than cultivates fresh perspectives]{.underline}. [The
State Department today risks losing the "war for talent," not only to
the private sector but increasingly to other government agencies, due to
inflexible career tracks, self-defeating hiring constraints, and a lack
of commitment to training and professional development]{.underline}.
Finally, [DOS is **hampered** by Congress's failure over many years to
pass authorizing legislation, leading to budgetary pressures and
diminishing DOS's status in the hierarchy of national security agencies
rather than reinforcing the nation's paramount foreign policy
institution]{.underline}.

[America spends billions each year on security cooperation and
assistance programs, but the results do not match the
investment]{.underline}. To help improve efficiencies, [the Center for
American Progress recently proposed consolidating **all** these programs
within the State Department]{.underline}. [**That would be a big
mistake**, because it would minimize the Pentagon's role in shaping and
directing security assistance and, ultimately, the program's military
objectives would be subordinated to State Department
interests]{.underline}, such as judicial reform and humanitarian
programs. Those are not the values by which such security assistance
programs should be solely judged. [Security sector assistance programs
deliver arms, military training, and other defense-related services to
allies and partner nation governments]{.underline} via grants, loans,
credit, cash sales, or leasing. [By definition, these programs
**should** prioritize national security. To this end, reforms should
enhance joint State and Defense authorities so programs are evaluated in
terms of America's national strategic goals]{.underline}.

**[Conclusion]{.underline}** [Building the capacity of foreign
military]{.underline} forces to counter terrorism and conduct stability
operations [is DOD's strategy to promote the security of the United
States.]{.underline}63 DOD's direct authority to train and equip
military partners promotes US national security, but it risks moving the
United States toward a more militarized US foreign policy. [Risks are
mitigated because the State Department's ability to implement US foreign
policy remains strong through its close relationship with DOD and direct
involvement in security assistance programs]{.underline}. [Congress also
remains engaged with yearly debate over the appropriate whole of
government approach to promoting US security interests]{.underline}.
**[Militarization]{.underline}** of US foreign policy through security
assistance exists but [**is managed** through the continuous interaction
and teamwork between DOD, the State Department, and
Congress]{.underline}.

### Military Cooperation Good

#### Military-to-military contacts are necessary to build trust and avoid miscalculation

[Within the main elements of national power]{.underline} (diplomacy,
informational, military, and economic, or DIME), [the military is often
considered the last resort. However, the U.S. military has been a **key
player** in, for instance, the **spread of democracy, building partner
countries' strength through military-to-military
relationships**]{.underline} (including in the form of bi- and
trilateral exercises to support standing Operation Plans, NATO, the
United Nations, and Theater Security Cooperation), [personnel exchange,
and humanitarian assistance operations. Through these efforts, among
others, the U.S. military helps to carry out the diplomatic mission of
the United States]{.underline} ([military diplomacy paved the way for
NATO]{.underline}, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization,
[for instance]{.underline}). [When military units participate in
bilateral or multilateral exercises]{.underline} with other countries,
for example, [the purpose is several-fold: The interaction **increases
interoperability** between the militaries, provides for **cultural
exchange and understanding**, and offers an opportunity to expand each
nation's capabilities while exercising potential contingencies. The
importance of military diplomacy in foreign engagement is to **build
dialogue** that may facilitate **further communication and, during a
crisis, avoid confusion between cultures**]{.underline}.

#### [Military-first]{.underline} should be the objective for all security assistance

[Another report published this month by the Center for a New American
Security rightly suggests that security assistance]{.underline} in the
Middle East [should be guided by strategy and applied narrowly to
military effects]{.underline}. However, the report's recommendations are
limited to counterterrorism activities and a strategy of deprioritizing
the Middle East in favor of the Indo-Pacific. If limiting security
assistance to [**military** **purpose**]{.underline}s would make
programs more effective in a region of waning emphasis, it stands to
reason that this [**should be the formative basis** for all security
assistance programs, especially when strategy calls for increased
investment in the security capacities of partner nations]{.underline}.
[Reforms to security assistance should push the agencies in this
direction, encouraging---or compelling---State to design its programs in
closer **coordination with the Pentagon** and in support of Defense
Department's operational needs, such as improving military forward
presence, wartime resilience and interoperability]{.underline}.

### AT: Diplomatic Cred Impact

#### No diplomacy impact and too many alt causes

C. Richard **Neu 13**, senior economist at the nonprofit, nonpartisan
RAND Corporation, 2/8/13, "U.S. \'Soft Power\' Abroad Is Losing Its
Punch,"
<http://www.rand.org/blog/2013/02/us-soft-power-abroad-is-losing-its-punch.html?utm_campaign=rand_socialflow_twitter&utm_source=rand_socialflow_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow>

This is a small example of what may be a troubling trend: [[America\'s
fiscal predicament]{.mark} and the]{.underline} seeming [inability of
its political system to resolve these matters [may
be]{.mark}]{.underline} [[taking a toll on]{.mark} the instruments of
[U.S. "soft power]{.mark}]{.underline}[" [and]{.underline}]{.mark} on
[the]{.underline} country\'s [[ability to shape international
developments]{.mark} in ways that serve American interests]{.underline}.
The most potent instrument of U.S. soft power is probably the simple
size of the U.S. economy. As the biggest economy in the world, America
has a lot to say about how the world works. But the economics profession
is beginning to understand that high levels of public debt can slow
economic growth, especially when gross general government debt rises
above 85 or 90 percent of GDP. The United States crossed that threshold
in 2009, and the negative effects are probably mostly out in the future.
These will come at a bad time. The U.S. share of global economic output
has been falling since 1999---by nearly 5 percentage points as of 2011.
As America\'s GDP share declined, so did its share of world trade, which
may reduce U.S. influence in setting the rules for international trade.
And it\'s not just the debt itself that may be slowing GDP growth.
Economists at Stanford and the University of Chicago have demonstrated
that uncertainty about economic policy---on the rise as a result of
political squabbling over U.S. fiscal policy---typically foreshadows
slower economic growth. [[Investors]{.mark} may be [grow]{.mark}ing
[skittish about U.S.]{.mark} government [debt levels]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the [disordered]{.mark} state of U.S. [fiscal
policymaking]{.mark}]{.underline}. From the beginning of 2002, when U.S.
government debt was at its most recent minimum as a share of GDP, to the
end of 2012, the dollar lost 25 percent of its value, in price-adjusted
terms, against a basket of the currencies of major trading partners.
This may have been because investors fear that the only way out of the
current debt problems will be future inflation. [[The dollar
has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[given up]{.mark} a bit of its
[dominance]{.mark} as the preferred currency]{.underline} for
international reserves among advanced economies. And [the renminbi
appears to have replaced the dollar as the "reference currency" for most
of East Asia]{.underline}. (The good news is that in recent years U.S.
banks have increased their share of deposits from foreigners, mostly at
the expense of banks in London.) More troubling for the future is that
[private domestic investment]{.underline}---the fuel for future economic
growth---[shows a strong negative correlation with government debt
levels]{.underline} over several business cycles dating back to the late
1950s. Continuing high debt does not bode well in this regard. But
perhaps the worst consequences of U.S. debt are actions not taken.
[[U.S.]{.mark} international [leadership has been
based]{.mark}]{.underline}, in part, [[on
contributions]{.underline}]{.mark}---political and financial---[[to
major institutions and initiatives]{.underline}]{.mark} ---International
Monetary Fund, World Bank, General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (and
later World Trade Organization), NATO, North America Free Trade
Agreement, the Marshall Plan, and so on. These served U.S. interests and
made the world better. But [what have we done lately?]{.underline} The
[[Doha]{.underline}]{.mark} round of trade negotiations has
[[stalled]{.underline}. [Ditto]{.underline}]{.mark} efforts at
coordinated international [action on [climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Countries of the Arab Spring need
rebuilding]{.underline}. [[Little progress is apparent on]{.mark} the
[T]{.mark}rans[p]{.mark}acific [P]{.mark}artnership]{.underline}, a
proposed new free-trade area. And [[warnings from the
U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} treasury secretary [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
his [European counterparts about]{.underline} the dangers of failing to
resolve [the fiscal crisis in [the eurozone met]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[with public rebukes]{.underline}]{.mark}: Get your own house in order
before you lecture us. [Have [U.S. fiscal problems undermined
America\'s]{.mark} self confidence and [external credibility to the
extent that it can no longer lead]{.mark}?]{.underline} And [what about
unmet needs at home]{.underline}---healthcare costs, a foundering public
education system, deteriorating infrastructure, and increasing
inequality? [[A strained fiscal situation]{.mark} that limits resources
for action and [absorbs so much political energy]{.mark}]{.underline}
[cannot be helping with any of these matters]{.underline}. But [without
progress on such things]{.underline}, [[what becomes of the social
cohesion necessary for unified]{.mark} [action abroad or]{.mark} the
[moral authority to lead]{.mark} other nations by example?]{.underline}
America\'s fiscal predicament is serious. The problem has become obvious
in the last few years, but it has been building for decades, largely the
result of promises of extensive social benefits without a corresponding
willingness to pay for them. Putting U.S. government financing on a
sustainable path will require painful adjustments over a number of
years---increased government revenue and painful reductions in
government outlays, almost certainly including outlays for defense and
international affairs. [During the necessary period of fiscal adjustment
and constrained government resources]{.underline}, [[U.S. international
influence may decline yet further]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### Single instances of action do not change international perceptions of the US.

**Fettweis 8** (Christopher -- professor of political science at Tulane,
Credibility and the War on Terror, Political Science Quarterly, Winter)

Since Vietnam, [[scholars have been]{.mark} generally [**unable to
identify** cases in which]{.mark} high [credibility helped the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[achieve its
goals]{.mark}. The shortterm aftermath of [the Cuban Missile
Crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [[did not
include]{.underline}]{.mark} a string of [Soviet
[reversals]{.mark}]{.underline}, or the kind of benign bandwagoning with
the West that deterrence theorists would have expected. In fact, the
perceived reversal in Cuba seemed to harden Soviet resolve. As the
crisis was drawing to a close, Soviet diplomat Vasily Kuznetsov angrily
told his counterpart, \"You Americans will never be able to do this to
us again.\"37 Kissinger commented in his memoirs that \"the Soviet Union
thereupon launched itself on a determined, systematic, and long-term
program of expanding all categories of its military power \.... The 1962
Cuban crisis was thus a historic turning point-but not for the reason
some Americans complacently supposed.\"38 The reassertion of the
credibility of the United States, which was done at the brink of nuclear
war, had few long-lasting benefits. The Soviets seemed to learn the
wrong lesson. [[There is]{.mark} actually [**scant evidence** that other
states ever learn]{.mark} the right [lessons. Cold War history contains
**little reason** to believe that]{.mark} the [credibility]{.mark} of
the superpowers [had very much effect on their ability to **influence
others**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Over the last decade, [[a series
of]{.mark} major [scholarly studies]{.mark} have [cast further **doubt**
upon the **fundamental assumption**]{.mark} of interdependence across
foreign policy actions]{.underline}. Employing methods borrowed from
social psychology rather than the economics-based models commonly
employed by deterrence theorists, Jonathan [Mercer argued that threats
are far more independent than is commonly believed and]{.underline},
therefore, [that [reputations are **not likely** to be formed on the
basis of **individual actions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.39 While
policymakers may feel that their decisions send messages about their
basic dispositions to others, most of the evidence from social
psychology suggests otherwise. [[Groups]{.mark} tend to
[interpret]{.mark} the [actions]{.mark} of their rivals [as situational,
**dependent** upon the constraints of **place** and
**time**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, [[they are not likely to form
**lasting impressions**]{.underline}]{.mark} of irresolution [[from
**single**]{.mark}, independent **[events]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Mercer
argued that the interdependence assumption had been accepted on faith,
and rarely put to a coherent test; when it was, it almost inevitably
failed.40

[Conclusion]{.underline}

[It has become a **stylized fact** that dyadic democracy lowers the
hazard of armed conflict]{.underline}. While [the Democratic Peace has
faced many challenges]{.underline}, we believe [the most significant
challenge has come from the argument that [the pacifying effect of
democracy is **epiphenomenal to territorial issues**]{.mark},
specifically the external threats that they pose]{.underline}. [This
argument sees the lower hazards of armed conflict among democracies
**not** as a product of shared norms or institutional structures, but as
a **result of settled borders**]{.underline}. Territory, though, remains
only one geo-political context generating threat, insecurity, and a
higher likelihood of armed conflict. Strategic rivalry also serves as an
environment associated with fear, a lack of trust, and an expectation of
future conflict. [[Efforts to assess democratic pacifism]{.mark} have
largely **[ignored rivalry]{.mark}** as a context conditioning the
behavior of democratic leaders]{.underline}. To be sure, research
demonstrates rivals to have higher probabilities of armed conflict and
democracies rarely to be rivals. But [fundamental to the Democratic
Peace is the notion that even in the face of difficult security
challenges and salient issues, dyadic democracy will associate with a
lower likelihood of militarized aggression. But the presence of an
**external threat**, be that threat disputed territory or strategic
rivalry, may be the key mechanism by which [democratic leaders]{.mark},
owing to **audience costs**, **resolve** and **electoral pressures**,
**[fail to resolve problems nonviolently]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[This study has sought a ''hard test'' of the Democratic Peace by
testing the conditional effects of joint democracy on armed conflict
when external threat is present]{.underline}. We test three measures of
threat: territorial contention, strategic rivalry, and a threat index
that sums the first two measures. [For robustness checks, we use two
additional measures of our dependent variable: fatal MID onset, and
event data from the Armed Conflict Database]{.underline}, which can be
found in our Online Appendix. As most studies report, democratic dyads
are associated with less armed conflict than mixed-regime and autocratic
dyads. In every one of our models, when we control for each measure of
external threat, joint democracy is strongly negative and significant
and each measure of threat is strongly positive and significant. Here,
liberal institutions maintain their pacific ability and [external
threats clearly increase conflict propensities]{.underline}. However,
[[when we test the **interactive relationship** between democracy
and]{.mark} our measures of [external threat, the pacifying
effect]{.mark} of democracy [is **less visible**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Park and James (2015) find some evidence that when faced with an
external threat in the form of territorial contention, the pacifying
effect of joint democracy holds up. This study does not fully support
the claims of Park and James (2015). [Using a longer timeframe, [we
find]{.mark} more [**consistent evidence** that]{.mark} when faced with
an external threat, be it territorial contention, strategic rivalry, or
a combination, **democratic [pacifism does not
survive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. What are the implications of our study?
First, while it is clear that we do not observe a large amount of armed
conflict among democratic states, if we organize interstate
relationships along a continuum from highly hostile to highly friendly,
we are probably observing what Goertz et al. (2016) and Owsiak et al.
(2016) refer to as ''lesser rivalries'' in which ''both the frequency
and severity of violent interaction decline. Yet, the sentiments of
threat, enmity, and competition that remain---along with the persistence
of unresolved issues---mean that lesser rivalries still experience
isolated violent episodes (e.g., militarized interstate disputes),
diplomatic hostility, and non-violent crises'' (Owsiak et al., 2016).
Second, our findings show that [[the pacific benefits of **liberal
institutions** or]{.mark} externalized [**norms** are **not**]{.mark}
always [able to lower the likelihood of]{.mark} armed [conflict]{.mark}
when faced with external threats, whether those hazards are disputed
territory, strategic rivalry, or a combination of the two]{.underline}.
The structural environment clearly influences democratic leaders in
their foreign policy actions more than has heretofore been appreciated.
[[**Audience costs**, **resolve**, and **electoral pressures**]{.mark},
produced from external threats, [are **powerful forces**]{.mark} that
are [present even in jointly democratic
relationships]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[These]{.mark} forces [make it
difficult for leaders to **trust one another**, which **inhibits
conflict resolution** and facilitates persistent
**hostility**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It does appear]{.underline}, then,
[that there is a **limit** to the Democratic Peace]{.underline}.

#### Democracy is [resilient]{.underline}, but it solves [nothing]{.underline}.

**Doorenspleet 19** Renske Doorenspleet, Politics Professor at the
University of Warwick. \[Rethinking the Value of Democracy: A
Comparative Perspective, Palgrave Macmillan, p. 239-243\]

[The value of democracy has been **taken for granted**]{.underline}
until recently, but this assumption seems to be under threat now more
than ever before. As was explained in Chapter 1, democracy's claim to be
valuable does not rest on just one particular merit, and scholars tend
to distinguish three different types of values (Sen 1999). This book
focused on the instrumental value of democracy (and hence not on the
intrinsic and constructive value), and investigated the value of
democracy for peace (Chapters 3 and 4), control of corruption (Chapter
5) and economic development (Chapter 6). [This study was based on a
search of **an enormous academic database**]{.underline} for certain
keywords,6 [then pruned **the thousands of articles**]{.underline} down
to a few hundred articles (see Appendix) [which **statistically
analysed** the connection between the democracy and the four expected
outcomes]{.underline}. The frst fiding is that [[**a reverse wave away
from democracy** has not happened]{.underline}]{.mark} (see Chapter 2).
Not yet, at least. [Democracy is not doing worse than
before]{.underline}, at least not [in comparative
perspective]{.underline}. While it is true that there is a dramatic
decline in democracy in some countries,7 [[a general trend downwards
cannot yet be detected]{.underline}]{.mark}. It would be better to talk
about 'stagnation', as not many dictatorships have democratized
recently, while democracies have not yet collapsed. Another fnding is
that the instrumental value of democracy is very questionable. The feld
has been deeply polarized between researchers who endorse a link between
democracy and positive outcomes, and those who reject this optimistic
idea and instead emphasize the negative effects of democracy. [There has
been **'[no consensus']{.mark}** [in **the quantitative literature** on
whether democracy has]{.mark}]{.underline} instrumental value which
leads some [**[beneficial general outcomes]{.mark}**. Some scholars
claim there is a consensus, but they only do so by ignoring **a huge
amount of literature** which rejects their own point of
view]{.underline}. After undertaking a large-scale analysis of carefully
selected articles published on the topic (see Appendix), [this book can
conclude that the connections between democracy and expected benefts are
**not**]{.underline} as **[strong]{.underline}** as they seem. Hence, we
should not overstate the links between the phenomena. [[**The overall
evidence** is **weak**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Take the expected impact of
democracy on peace for example. As Chapter 3 showed, the study of
democracy and interstate war has been a fourishing theme in political
science, particularly since the 1970s. However, there are four reasons
why democracy does not cause peace between countries, and why the
empirical support for the popular idea of democratic peace is quite
weak. [**Most statistical studies** have not found **a strong
correlation** between democracy and **interstate war** at **the dyadic
level**]{.underline}. They show that [[there are other---**more
powerful**---explanations for war]{.underline}]{.mark} and peace, and
even that [the impact of democracy is **a spurious one**]{.underline}
(caveat 1). Moreover, [[the theoretical foundation of the democratic
peace hypothesis is **weak**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and [the causal
mechanisms are **unclear**]{.underline}]{.mark} (caveat 2). In addition,
[democracies are not]{.underline} necessarily **[more peaceful in
general]{.underline}**, and [the evidence]{.underline} for the
democratic peace hypothesis [at **the monadic level** is
**inconclusive**]{.underline} (caveat 3). Finally, the process of
[democratization is **dangerous**]{.underline}. Living in a
democratizing country means living in a less peaceful country (caveat
4). With regard to peace between countries, we cannot defend the idea
that democracy has instrumental value. [Can the]{.underline}
(instrumental) [value]{.underline} of democracy [be found in the
prevention of civil war?]{.underline} Or is the evidence for the
opposite idea more convincing, and does democracy have a 'dark side'
which makes civil war more likely? The findings are confusing, which is
exacerbated by the fact that different aspects of civil war (prevalence,
onset, duration and severity) are mixed up in some civil war studies.
Moreover, defining civil war is a delicate, politically sensitive issue.
Determining whether there is a civil war in a particular country is
incredibly diffcult, while measurements suffer from many weaknesses
(caveat 1). Moreover, [there is **no linear link**: civil wars are
**just as unlikely** in democracies as in dictatorships]{.underline}
(caveat 2). Civil war is most likely in times of political change.
[Democratization is **a very unpredictable**, **dangerous process**,
increasing the chance of civil war significantly]{.underline}. Hybrid
systems are at risk as well: the chance of civil war is much higher
compared to other political systems (caveat 3). More specifcally, both
the strength and type of political institutions matter when explaining
civil war. However, [the type of political system (e.g. democracy or
dictatorship) is **not the decisive factor at all**]{.underline} (caveat
4). Finally, democracy has only limited explanatory power (caveat 5).
[Economic factors are far more significant than political
factors]{.underline} (such as having a democratic system) when
explaining the onset, duration and severity of civil war. To prevent
civil war, it would make more sense to make poorer countries richer,
instead of promoting democracy. [Helping countries]{.underline} to
[democratize would **even be a very dangerous idea**]{.underline}, as
countries with changing levels of democracy are most vulnerable, making
civil wars most likely. It is true that there is evidence that the
chance of civil war decreases when the extent of democracy increases
considerably. The problem however is that most countries do not go
through big political changes but through small changes instead; those
small steps---away or towards more democracy---are dangerous. Not only
is the onset of civil war likely under such circumstances, but civil
wars also tend to be longer, and the confict is more cruel leading to
more victims, destruction and killings (see Chapter 4). A more
encouraging story can be told around the value for democracy to control
corruption in a country (see Chapter 5). Fighting corruption has been
high on the agenda of international organizations such as the World Bank
and the IMF. Moreover, the theme of corruption has been studied
thoroughly in many different academic disciplines---mainly in economics,
but also in sociology, political science and law. Democracy has often
been suggested as one of the remedies when fghting against high levels
of continuous corruption. So far, the statistical evidence has strongly
supported this idea. As Chapter 5 showed, dozens of studies with broad
quantitative, cross-national and comparative research have found
statistically signifcant associations between (less) democracy and
(more) corruption. However, there are vast problems around
conceptualization (caveat 1) and measurement (caveat 2) of 'corruption'.
Another caveat is that [democratizing countries are **the poorest
performers** with]{.underline} regard to [controlling
corruption]{.underline} (caveat 3). Moreover, it is not democracy in
general, but particular political institutions which have an impact on
the control of corruption; and a free press also helps a lot in order to
limit corruptive practices in a country (caveat 4). In addition,
democracies seem to be less affected by corruption than dictatorships,
but at the same time, there is clear evidence that economic factors have
more explanatory power (caveat 5). In conclusion, more democracy means
less corruption, but we need to be modest (as other factors matter more)
and cautious (as there are many caveats). The perceived impact of
democracy on development has been highly contested as well (see Chapter
6). Some scholars argue that democratic systems have a positive impact,
while others argue that high levels of democracy actually reduce the
levels of economic growth and development. Particularly since the 1990s,
statistical studies have focused on this debate, and [the empirical
evidence is **clear**: [there is **no direct impact** of
democracy]{.mark} on development]{.underline}. Hence, both approaches
cannot be supported (see caveat 1). The indirect impact via other
factors is also questionable (caveat 2). Moreover, [[there is **too much
variation**]{.mark} in]{.underline} levels of economic
[growth]{.underline} and development [among the dictatorial
systems]{.underline}, and there are huge regional differences (caveat
3). Adopting a one-size-ftsall approach would not be wise at all. In
addition, in order to increase development, it would be better to focus
on alternative factors such as improving institutional quality and good
governance (caveat 4). There is not suffcient evidence to state that
democracy has instrumental value, at least not with regard to economic
growth. However, future research needs to include broader concepts and
measurements of development in their models, as so far studies have
mainly focused on explaining cross-national differences in growth of GDP
(caveat 5). Overall, [[**the instrumental value of democracy**
is]{.underline}]{.mark}---at best---tentative, or---if being less
mild---[**[simply non-existent]{.mark}**. Democracy is **not necessarily
better** than **any alternative form of government**. With]{.underline}
regard to [many]{.underline} of the expected [benefts---such as less
war, less corruption and more economic development---democracy **does
deliver, but so do nondemocratic systems**]{.underline}. High or low
levels of democracy do not make a distinctive difference. Mid-range
democracy levels do matter though. Hybrid systems can be associated with
many negative outcomes, while this is also the case for democratizing
countries. Moreover, other explanations---typically certain favourable
economic factors in a country---are much more powerful to explain the
expected benefts, at least compared to the single fact that a country is
a democracy or not. The impact of democracy fades away in the powerful
shadows of the economic factors.8 . Moreover, other
explanations---typically certain favourable economic factors in a
country---are much more powerful to explain the expected benefts, at
least compared to the single fact that a country is a democracy or not.
