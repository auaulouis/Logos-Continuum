Evolutionary theory can also explain dominance. Like egoism, [the desire
to dominate is a trait of human nature]{.underline} (which, as with
egoism, we stress does not necessarily apply to every individual or
situation but is a statistical tendency underlying behavior). As
evolutionary economist Robert Frank has explained, [**''Evidence
suggests that we come into the world equipped with a nervous system that
worries about rank.** Something inherent in our biological
makeup]{.underline} **[motivates us to try to improve]{.underline}**,
[or at least maintain]{.underline}, **[our standing against those with
whom we compete]{.underline}** [for important positional
resources]{.underline}.''94 In the context of evolutionary theory,
[dominance usually means that particular individuals]{.underline} in a
social group [have priority of access to resources]{.underline} [in
competitive situations]{.underline}.95 A wide variety of [animals
exhibit a form of social organization called a dominance
hierarchy]{.underline}, in which members of a social group each have a
status rank descending from the alpha male down through all the other
individuals to the lowliest subordinates[. A dominance hierarchy is
created competitively]{.underline}, [often violently, **and is
maintained forcefully**]{.underline}, [but it can]{.underline} serve to
[prevent or reduce]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline} within a group
[because it establishes a pecking order that is generally
respected]{.underline}. As with all things in nature, [dominance
hierarchies vary considerably]{.underline}. Hierarchies may be weak or
strong, and ''alpha'' males may sire nearly all offspring or just more
than others. However, what is striking is the prevalence and potency of
dominance in social organization, despite variations in the specifics.
[Dominance behavior]{.underline} **[occurs in thousands of taxonomic
groups ranging from fish and reptiles to birds and
mammals.]{.underline}** Of particular note regarding the impact of
dominance on human behavior are the roles of both phylogeny (a species'
ancestral lineage) and ecology (its adaptations to local conditions).
With regard to phylogeny, [most primates and all the great
apes]{.underline} (the group to which humans belong) [have strong social
dominance hierarchies, and humans are no
exception]{.underline}---**[dominance hierarchies have been extensively
documented among humans in a wide variety of settings and
eras]{.underline}**.96,97,98 With regard to ecology, dominance
hierarchies are a common form of social organization in the kind of
ecological settings in which humans evolved (social groups with
competing interests, variation in power, and finite resources). The
strength of dominance hierarchies in humans is debated and varies
empirically, but such hierarchies are always evident in some form or
other. [Even where dominance hierarchies are actively
suppressed]{.underline}, such as in more egalitarian small-scale
societies, **[suppression itself is evidence of the competition for
status that simmers beneath the surface]{.underline}**.99 In historical
and contemporary societies, **[competition for power is all too
obvious]{.underline}**, and [the quest for status, dominance, and
leadership is ancient and ever present]{.underline}.100,101,102,103
Males of most mammal species are particularly competitive with each
other over females. Indeed, the competition for mates is subject to a
special type of evolutionary selection process---sexual selection, as
opposed to standard natural selection. Reproductive access to females
tends to be highly skewed, with a few males responsible for a large
proportion of progeny. This is because a single male can reproduce with
multiple females, whereas females can usually only reproduce and rear
the offspring of one male at a time, with a long delay before becoming
reproductively available again. In some species, reproductive access is
settled by coercion, in which the strongest male defeats rivals to
dominate a harem. In other species, males cannot coerce females, but the
females are choosy about with whom they mate, leading to selection
pressures for males to demonstrate or signal their quality as attractive
partners. In either case, it is females rather than males that are the
limiting factor in sexual competition, making male competition for
available females intense. Sexual selection has led to costly biological
adaptations, such as fighting, the growth of heavy ''weapons'' (e.g.,
antlers), risky courtship displays, or adornments that signal genetic
quality (e.g., gigantic tails). These types of adaptations not only
consume precious time and energy but can also decrease survival in
other, nonreproductive domains of life (for example, the plumage of male
peacocks limits their ability to fly). Thus, the power of sexual
selection can lead to the evolution of traits that actually damage
survival in order to achieve superiority over other males.104,105
Reproduction trumps survival in evolution. [Sexual selection is
typically responsible for the hierarchical nature of group-living animal
species]{.underline}, including humans, [as males fight for rank and the
reproductive benefits in brings]{.underline}. As we would expect, [this
leads to sex differences in the desire for status.]{.underline} Both
laboratory experiments and real-world observations have identified
empirical differences between men and women in a range of social
behaviors, not least that men tend to have relative-gains, or
''zero-sum'' motivations (wanting to get ahead at the expense of
others), whereas women tend to favor payoff-maximization, or
''variable-sum'' motivations (content to do well even if others also do
well in the process).106,107,108,109 It is well established that
[dominance and statusseeking behaviors]{.underline} [in humans are based
on many of the same biochemical and neurological processes as in other
mammals]{.underline}, **[such as the secretion and uptake of
testosterone and serotonin]{.underline}**, [which modify
status-challenging behavior]{.underline}.110,111 However rational we may
like to think we are, [our judgments and decision-making are
nevertheless influenced by cognitive mechanisms and
biochemicals]{.underline} circulating in our bodies and brains that
relate to dominance behavior.112,113,114,115 Dominance hierarchies need
not only benefit those at the top. An [organized social structure can
help promote the harvesting of resources]{.underline}, [coordinate group
activity, and reduce within-group conflict]{.underline}. Although alphas
in the hierarchy tend to have the highest reproductive success, other
[males may benefit from group membership by gaining protection from
other groups]{.underline}, or by biding their time for a chance to
challenge the alpha male when they become strong enough or old enough.
**[Ethological studies have shown that hierarchical dominance systems
within a primate group's social network can reduce overt
aggression]{.underline}**, [although aggression increases again when the
alpha male is challenged]{.underline}.116,117,118 To summarize, a
species that lives communally could have two broad forms of social
organization. [The group can accept organization with some
centralization of power]{.underline} ([dominance
hierarchies]{.underline}), [or it can engage in perpetual conflict
(''scramble competition''), which incurs costs in terms of time, energy,
and injuries, as well as depriving the group of many benefits of a
communal existence,]{.underline} such as more efficient resource
harvesting.119 Among social mammals, and primates in particular,
dominance hierarchies have emerged as the primary form of social
organization. Thus far, we have emphasized [a state of ''anarchy'' in
evolutionary history]{.underline}, **[in which there was no overarching
power to provide protection from predators]{.underline}**, rivals, or
other threats. **[Egoism and dominance arose as strategies that provided
solutions to achieving survival and reproduction in this
environment]{.underline}**. However, [dominance hierarchies were in some
sense a mechanism by which this anarchy could be
suppressed]{.underline}---at least within the group---to the benefit of
all group members since they share at least some common interests (such
as avoiding conflict). [This collective benefit points to the special
and much more significant role of anarchy at a higher
level]{.underline}---**[anarchy between groups]{.underline}**. As we
show in the next section, competition between groups is especially
significant for human evolution, and for international politics,
precisely because it is at the intergroup level where anarchy reigns
supreme and is much harder to suppress.

#### States' tendencies towards aggression and selfishness are derived from the evolutionary need to maintain dominance hierarchies

**[Evolutionary theory can also explain domination]{.underline}**. Like
egoism, [the desire to dominate is a trait]{.underline}. In the context
of evolutionary theory, **[domination usually means that particular
individuals in social groups have regular priority of access to
resources]{.underline}** in competitive situations. For most social
mammals, [a form of social organization called a dominance
hierarchy]{.underline} [operates most of the time.]{.underline} The
creation of the [dominance hierarchy may be violent and is almost always
competitive]{.underline}. A single leader, almost always male (the alpha
male), leads the group. The ubiquity of this social ordering strongly
suggests that such a [pattern of organization]{.underline} [contributes
to fitness.]{.underline} Ethologists categorize two principal types of
behavior among social mammals in a dominance hierarchy: dominant and
submissive.56 [Dominant mammals have enhanced access to mates, food, and
territory]{.underline}, **[increasing their chances of reproductive
success]{.underline}**.57 **[Acquiring dominant status usually requires
aggression]{.underline}**.58 Dominance, however, is an unstable
condition; to maintain it, [dominant individuals must be willing to
defend their privileged access]{.underline} to available resources as
long as they are able. Evolutionary anthropologist Richard Wrangham and
ethologist Dale Peterson explain why an individual animal is motivated
to vie for dominant status: \"The motivation of a male chimpanzee who
challenges another\'s rank is not that he foresees more matings or
better food or a longer life.\"59 Rather, \"those rewards explain why
\... selection has favored the desire for power, but the immediate
reason he vies for status \... is simply to dominate his peers.\"60
[Dominant animals often assume behavior reflecting their
status]{.underline}. For example, [dominant wolves and rhesus monkeys
hold their tails higher than other members of their group in an effort
to communicate dominance.]{.underline} A dominant animal that engages in
such displays is better off if it can gain priority of access to
resources without having to fight for it continuously.61 [Such signaling
behavior is found among submissive social mammals as well. They often
try to be as inconspicuous as possible]{.underline} and recognize what
is permitted and forbidden given their place in the hierarchy. **[This
behavior shows that the subordinate accepts its place in the dominance
hierarchy]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}-at least temporarily-[will
make no effort to challenge the dominant animal.]{.underline}
Ethologists argue that [dominance hierarchies evolve because they help
defend against predators, promote the harvesting of resources, and
reduce intragroup conflict]{.underline}.62 A species that lives
communally has two choices. It can either accept organization with some
centralization of power, or engage in perpetual conflict over scarce
resources, which may result in serious injury and deprive the group of
the benefits of a communal existence, such as more efficient resource
harvesting.63 Ethological studies have confirmed that a hierarchical
dominance system within a primate band minimizes overt aggression and
that group aggression often increases when the alpha male is
challenged.64 For primates and especially humans, the dominance
hierarchy may have produced a fortuitous result: great intelligence.65
As cognitive psychologist Denise Dellarosa Cummins argues, it has had a
profound effect on human evolution: \"[The fundamental components of our
reasoning architectur]{.underline}e [evolved in response to pressures to
reason about dominance hierarchies]{.underline}, the social organization
that characterizes most social mammals.\"66 Her study and others have
found that dominance hierarchies have contributed to the evolution of
the mind, which in turn has contributed to fitness. According to
Cummins, [submissive individuals can detect, exploit, and circumvent the
constraints of domination. If an animal can take what it wants by
force**, it is sure to dominate the available
resources**]{.underline}-[unless its subordinates are smart enough to
outwit]{.underline} [it]{.underline}. To survive, a subordinate must use
other strategies: deception, guile, appeasement, bartering, alliance
formation, or friendship. Thus intelligence is particularly important to
the survival of subordinates. \"[The evolution of mind
emerges]{.underline},\" Cummins writes, \"**[as a strategic arms race in
which the weaponry is ever-increasing mental capacity to represent and
manipulate internal representations of the minds of
others.]{.underline}**\"67 From their studies of chimpanzee societies,
ethologists have learned that the struggle for survival is best
characterized as a struggle between those who are dominant and those
seeking to outwit them, i.e., between recognizing an opponent\'s
intentions and hiding one\'s own. The following example illustrates how
a subordinate chimpanzee, Belle, who knows the location of hidden food,
attempts to deceive Rock, who is dominant: Belle accordingly stopped
uncovering the food if Rock was close. She sat on it until Rock left.
Rock, however, soon learned this, and when she sat in one place for more
than a few seconds, he came over, shoved her aside, searched her sitting
place, and got the food. Belle next stopped going all the way \[to the
food\]. Rock, however, countered by steadily expanding the area of his
search through the grass near where Belle had sat. Eventually, Belle sat
farther and farther away, waiting until Rock looked in the opposite
direction before she moved toward the food at all, and Rock in turn
seemed to look away until Belle started to move somewhere. On some
occasions Rock started to wander off, only to wheel around suddenly
precisely as Belle was about to uncover some food \.... On a few trials,
she actually started off a trail by leading the group in the opposite
direction from the food, and then, while Rock was engaged in his search,
she doubled back rapidly and got some food. 68 [Despite the \"arms
race\" described by Cummins to outwit dominance, the subordinate members
of the group continue to participate]{.underline} in the dominance
hierarchy **[because doing so increases the chances of
survival]{.underline}**. As ethologist David Barash explains**[, if
subordinates \"are more fit by accepting]{.underline}**\"
[subordinate]{.underline} \"[ranking than by refusing to
participate]{.underline}, **[then some form of social dominance
hierarchy will result]{.underline}**.\"69 Humans and other primates
evolved a mental architecture to address the difficulties they
encountered in dominance hierarchies. These problems, which \"directly
impact survival rates and reproductive success,\" include two crucial
needs: \"the necessity to recognize and respond appropriately to
permissions, obligations, and prohibition,\" and the necessity \"to
circumvent the constraints of hierarchy by dint of guile, particularly
through successfully forecasting others\' behavior. \"70 Because [human
mental architecture was created through evolution]{.underline}, **[it
remains part of human behavior today]{.underline}**, as cognitive
psychology studies show. 71

### State Militarism Inevitable- Realism

#### **Realism's mechanism for change is War**

**Wivel, 18** Anders Wivel- Professor of Political Science at the
University of Copenhagen. His research interests include political
realism, power politics and foreign policy, in particular the foreign
policy of small states. His articles have appeared in various journals
including Cooperation and Conflict, Journal of Common Market Studies,
Security Dialogue, Cambridge Review of International Affairs, Journal of
International Relations and Development and European Security. "Realism
and Peaceful Change," E-International Relations, 2018.
[https://www.e-ir.info/2018/02/09/realism-and-peaceful-change/#:\~:text=Realism%20is%20most%20often%20depicted,of%20change%20in%20international%20relations.]{.underline}

[Realism is]{.underline} most often depicted as [a]{.underline}
tradition or [perspective on international relations explaining war and
military conflict]{.underline}. This is not without reason as [realists
have focused on war as]{.underline} a major or even [the primary
mechanism of change in international relations.]{.underline} Thucydides,
in The History of the Peloponnesian War, written in the fifth century
BC, and a standard reference in textbook accounts of the realist
tradition, found that '\[t\]he growth of the power of Athens, and the
alarm which this inspired in Lacedaemon, made war inevitable'
(Thucydides 431 BC, 1.23). This position is echoed in realism up until
today. For instance, in his modern classic, aptly entitled War and
Change in World Politics, Robert Gilpin asserts that 'a precondition for
[political change lies in a disjuncture between the existing social
system and the redistribution of power towards those]{.underline} actors
[who]{.underline} would [benefit most]{.underline} from a change in the
system', [and that change]{.underline} in international relations
typically [equals war]{.underline} (Gilpin 1981, 9). Likewise, John
Mearsheimer, in The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, argues that the
most war-prone regions are those characterised by unbalanced
multipolarity with a potential hegemon seeking to change the established
order in its favour by military means, and that the growth of China
constitutes the greatest danger to world peace (Mearsheimer 2001). This
does not mean that realists are unconcerned with peace. Acting as policy
advisors or foreign policy commentators, realists have often been among
the most vocal critics of war. Hans Morgenthau and Kenneth Waltz,
arguably the two most prominent realists in the latter half of the
twentieth century, were both highly critical of US military intervention
in Vietnam (Rafshoon 2001; Humphreys 2013). More recently, 'almost all
realists in the United States -- except for Henry Kissinger -- opposed
the war against Iraq' in 2003 (Mearsheimer 2005), and [realists have
been highly critical of]{.underline} the [US military]{.underline}
[interventions]{.underline} during the Obama administration from 2009 to
2017 (Walt 2016). However, [despite this concern with peace, war remains
the primary mechanism for change in realist theory]{.underline}, and
realists have been surprisingly reluctant to explore the potential for
peaceful change.

#### Realism makes militarization and use of military power inevitable- states have a vested interest in armed force

second Master's degree in transatlantic studies at the University of
North Carolina Chapel Hill and Humboldt-University Berlin, from which
she graduated in September 2018. In January 2019, she will move to

[Political Realism sees international relations]{.underline} mainly
[as]{.underline} a struggle of [self-interested, sovereign
states]{.underline} that are [involved in a game of power-politics
within a]{.underline} permanent [state of anarchy.]{.underline} The
international system, according to this school of thought, is a moral-
and value-free environment in which the state is seen as a rational and
unitary actor that finds itself in constant conflict with the other
states of the system due to the lack of an overarching world government.
Stemming from their pessimistic view on human nature, [the only way to
achieve security]{.underline} in the international system, [according to
political realism, is by creating a Balance of Power among]{.underline}
the most [powerful states]{.underline} of the system. As briefly
mentioned earlier, both [political thinkers pick up on the realist
view]{.underline} of the international system [as a value- and
moral-free place of anarchy, where states live under]{.underline} a
constant [fear of attack or betrayal]{.underline} by others and thus are
facing a Security Dilemma. Thucydides, taking up the issue of anarchy
within the international system, very much agrees with the realist point
of view, saying that [in a system where there is no overarching
authority, the only way to maintain order is through some form of
Balance of Power]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} -- in the case of
Thucydides -- [takes the form of the strong exercising their power over
the weak.]{.underline} Hobbes, in comparison, takes quite a different
look at this. Stemming from his theory about the 'State of Nature', he
admits that without a world government, the system is subject to a state
of anarchy and of "a war as is of every man against every man"\[1\].
[However, Hobbes opposes the view that under such conditions it is the
strong who determine the order]{.underline} of the international system.
[According to his theory of the 'State of Nature', every man is equal
and thus "the weakest has strength enough to kill the
strongest]{.underline}, either by secret machination or by confederacy
with others that are in the same danger with himself."\[2\]. The order,
according to Hobbes, is rather maintained by a "general rule of
reason"\[3\] which is that "every man ought to endeavour peace"\[4\] and
since every man is equal in strength and desires, there is certainty
that this principle will be followed as long as one's own security is
not endangered. This leads on to the realist claim of a moral- and
value-free international system. He also claims that [peace and security
in an international system]{.underline} without an overarching authority
[can only be achieved through cooperation between states
and]{.underline} between [individuals]{.underline}. This leads on to the
next point which has to be made about the view of Hobbes and Thucydides
on individuals and states: cooperation. [Political realism sees no
actual possibility for states to form successful alliances]{.underline},
as no state can be trusted since it only relies on its self-interest and
does not pay much attention to what would happen to other states in the
system. Thucydides takes a similar stand as he -- although not ignoring
[the possibility -- is very sceptical]{.underline} of the chances of
success of such a form of cooperation given the anarchic structure of
the international system and solely self-interested states. Hobbes, on
the other hand, does recognise the limitations mentioned above, however
he also says that due to the fact that all states are equal within the
international system, they can "create more stable forms of coexistence
among themselves"\[8\] and thus establish peace and security.

### War = Human Nature

#### **War is inevitable and a part of human nature**

**Perry 19** (Craig Perry, emerging fellow and professional futurist,
February 24 2019, "IS ANOTHER GREAT-POWER WAR INEVITABLE?" APF,
<https://www.apf.org/blogpost/1763106/318624/Is-Another-Great-Power-War-Inevitable)-Cayden>
Mayer

[A century ago, with the world embroiled in what was then naively dubbed
the "war to end all wars,"]{.underline} few people imagined a second
global conflagration igniting just a generation later. Since the end of
World War II, however, humanity has experienced over seven decades of
relative peace, with the frequency of war deaths trending sharply
downward throughout this period. This is largely attributable to the
Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, a standoff that
spawned numerous proxy conflicts but never turned truly hot. It remains
to be seen whether the ongoing reemergence of a multipolar world, with
potentially several states capable of exerting influence on a global
scale, will lead to yet more wars among these so-called great powers.
There are good reasons to fear a return to great-power conflict.
[Warfare has been endemic to the human condition since the dawn of
civilization, and remains the ultimate way of resolving conflicts among
states even in the modern era. World affairs are inherently anarchic,
with states pursuing their own advantages in a Hobbesian struggle of
each against all.]{.underline} While the weak may occasionally band
together to balance would-be hegemons, the prevailing self-help system
of international relations features no permanent friends or enemies,
just interests. "[Countries have always competed for wealth and
security, and the competition has often led to conflict]{.underline},"
the late neo-realist scholar Kenneth Waltz noted. "[Why should the
future be different from the past?"]{.underline} Indeed, war has
accompanied the rise and fall of great powers throughout recorded
history. In his classic account of the Peloponnesian War, Greek
historian Thucydides concluded that the growth of Athenian power and the
fear this inspired in then-dominant Sparta made war between these
city-states inevitable. This dynamic, which political scientist Graham
Allison calls the "Thucydides Trap," has ensnared rising and established
powers in more than a dozen wars over the last 500 years---and it
threatens to do so again as other states challenge the United States for
global influence. Such systemic, structural factors are not the only
aspects of international relations that can drive states towards armed
conflict. Marxists argue that capitalism compels the core,
industrialized powers to compete for dominance as they exploit
peripheral countries for labor and raw materials. Political scientist
Samuel Huntington suggested it is culture---rather than ideology,
politics, or economics---that is shaping patterns of conflict, with the
Western belief in the universality of its values leading to clashes with
rival civilizations. Constructivists similarly believe ideas shape
international relations, as each state perceives world events in its own
peculiar way. [So why should the future be different from the past? With
nearly 200 sovereign states around the globe, it seems inevitable that
at least some of them will come into conflict in the coming
decades]{.underline}---and great powers will occasionally intervene if
only to enforce international law or for some other ostensibly noble
purpose. Yet it is far from certain that these great powers will again
come to blows with each other, for several reasons. While anarchy will
continue to characterize international relations for the foreseeable
future, a number of developments---including nuclear deterrence,
globalization of trade and investment, relevant international
institutions, shifting social norms, and widespread competition below
the threshold of war---are incrementally reducing the likelihood of
another great-power conflict. Will these trends be enough to prevent the
eventual outbreak of World War III?

#### Aggression is [biological]{.underline} --- psychological adaptations determine reactions to conflict

**Klasios**, **19** -- Researcher for York University (John,
\"Aggression among men: An integrated evolutionary explanation\",
Science Direct, July-August 2019, Vol. 47, p. 29-45))SK

\*\*we do not endorse gendered language

A number of [biosocial
[criminologists](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/criminologist)]{.underline}
have attempted to [illuminate aggression]{.underline} (as well as crime
and
[delinquency](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/social-sciences/delinquency)
more generally) [in terms of its
[heritability](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/heritability)]{.underline}.
Here, my aim will be twofold: First, to bridge behavior genetics with
the [explanatory
model](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/psychology/explanatory-model)
developed in this paper, and then to briefly discuss the evolutionary
processes that can act to generate heritable variation in traits
connected to male aggression. [Heritable variation in violent crime has
been established by behavior geneticists]{.underline} (e.g., [Barnes et
al.,
2014](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#bb0050);
[DiLalla & Gheyara,

[Rhee & Waldman,
2002](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#bb0570)).[7](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#fn0035)
On the one hand, these studies show us how much of the variance in a
given population, at a given time, can be explained by heritable
factors. Yet on the other hand, heritability studies are largely silent
on the mechanistic and developmental details that subserve the
heritability of traits. In order to see how these two sides of the coin
are interrelated, we can start by considering the concept of reactive
heritability, which sketches how heritable traits express or magnify
themselves developmentally (e.g., [Tooby & Cosmides,
1990](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#bb0680);
[von Rueden, Lukaszewski, & Gurven,
2015](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#bb0585)).
[To illustrate how]{.underline} such [processes]{.underline} can [work,
we can consider an example germane to **aggression**, whereby an
individual inherits above **average physical strength**.]{.underline}
From the figurative point-of-view of the underlying psychological
adaptations that govern aggression (broadly speaking), and all else
equal, it is unknown what the level of physical strength is in the
organism that the adaptations are developing and operating in. However,
it is possible that [natural-selection can design]{.underline} such
[adaptations so that they can assess what the agent\'s physical strength
level is]{.underline}---perhaps, for instance, [by attending to feedback
regarding how often, and to what degree, the agent is either successful
or unsuccessful in physical [conflicts of
interest](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/social-sciences/conflict-of-interest)]{.underline}
with other agents. Given these assessments, [the underlying
psychological adaptation can then compute an overall index of the
agent\'s physical strength, and then utilize that index when judging if
and when to instrumentally mete out aggression]{.underline}. Whether
such an adaptation has actually evolved, and, if so, what its design
features are, are of course empirical questions. However,
[**evolutionary psychologists** have]{.underline} indeed [found
experimental evidence that suggests that a psychological adaptation has
evolved in men that can assess one\'s physical strength, and then use
that assessment as an "internal regulatory variable" which
governs]{.underline}, for instance, [one\'s **proneness to use anger**
as a bargaining tactic during conflicts]{.underline} of interest with
other agents ([Sell, Cosmides, et al.,

#### War throughout history has always been caused by human nature and greed

It is too great a task to identify a common cause of all wars, past and
present, then attribute it responsibility for their commencing. However,
what can be done is to identify certain foundations common in all "war",
and pay heed to how "states \[or other structures\] actually behave,
behind the façade of their values-based rhetoric" (Kaplan, 2012, p.1).
It will be this essay's goal to determine first, what needs be included
in the definition of "human nature", and what constitutes "war", and
second, stake the claim that all political action, including that of
states, is derived primarily from this definition of human nature. The
first task is to define what is meant by "war", and while definitions
abound, it is possible to order them into one of two categories supplied
by the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. The first is the modern
conventional view, that [war is "the state of armed conflict between
nations or state]{.underline}s" (Oxford, 2007, p.3573),
[and]{.underline} the second, considerably broader, of "[any active
hostility or struggle between living beings]{.underline}" (Oxford, 2007,
p.3573). The former accounts well for conflicts that were overwhelmingly
state-centric, such as the First World War, and marks a clear
distinction between war and individual political violence: war is the
business of states. However, is the Vietnam War to be understood---like
the Korean---as a simple north versus south conflict, despite the
northern state only assuming active involvement nine years after
indigenous fighting broke out in 1955? (Young, 1991, p. 123) The second
category, while accounting correctly for the National Liberation Front
in Vietnam, is in need of qualification, or else runs the unhelpful risk
of equating all acts with warfare. While a simple merging of the two
definitions would not suffice, there are some similarities to be
observed. Both imply in the Clausewitzian sense that war is a tool used
to achieve ends: "a continuation of politics by other means"
(Clausewitz, 1989, p. 606). A state acts in its national interest, just
as Islamist group Ansar al-Dine acts in its---and its
people's---religio-political interests in Mali (Welsh, 2013). The latter
definition will be qualified by the observation that all actors engaged
in war, be they NLF in Vietnam, or Ansar al-Dine in Mali, do so in
hierarchical groups. ["War"]{.underline} in this [essay will be
characterised by its employment by united, hierarchical structures, as a
tool to achieve politics ends]{.underline}. While it is accepted that
wars have an almost infinite number of unique causes, the pursuit of a
primary explanation has a long tradition. From Christian teachings arose
what [Neorealist]{.underline}, Kenneth Waltz, [refers to as the
"pessimistic" view of human nature, its advocates attesting to a fixed
and flawed humanity]{.underline}, man's\[1\] inherent evil (Waltz, 2001,
p. 26). Among them is Sir Norman Angell who in 1925 wrote of man, the
"fighting animal, emotional, passionate, illogical..." (Angell, p. 7).
It is their view [that while rationality is pursued, it is---and will
forever be---blighted by the underlying imperfections of humanity, among
them, the propensity to war.]{.underline} The pessimist view endures, as
do the principles established in 17th century philosopher, Thomas
Hobbes's Leviathan. That [(hu)man will essentially pursue his own
interests and this]{.underline}, in the absence of a higher power, will
lead to conflict (Hobbes, 2008, pp. xxviii-xxx). In this state of
anarchy (of no higher authority), of "war with every other man",
[societies are apparently "few, fierce, short-lived, poor, nasty, and
destroyed of all that pleasure]{.underline}, and beauty of life, which
peace and society are wont to bring with them" (Hobbes, 2008, p. xxxi).
[Examples of such existences abound from the failed states of Somalia
and the Democratic Republic of Congo]{.underline}, and it is for this
reason that man yields his freedoms to authority, the only guarantor of
peace. The philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, too observed that: "one
man cannot begin to behave decently unless he has some assurance that
others will not be able to ruin him" (Waltz, 2001, pp. 6-7); the state
provides these assurances; this is why man assembles into states or
other structures. The state assumes the role of provider, acting too as
arbitrator within its territory while its constituents obey. But what of
a world in which multiple states emerge? Waltz writes that "Among men as
among states, anarchy, or the absence of government, is \[again\]
associated with the occurrence of violence" (emphasis mine) (Waltz,
1986, p. 98). However, that is not to say these societies are "few, and
fierce", least of all "short-lived" as Hobbes predicted. Many states
have long histories, and those that fail are clearly exceptions to the
rule. What is really at fault here is the pessimist view that human
nature is irrationally inclined to violence. As Waltz notes in his
critique, "a static human nature cannot explain the differences in
political outcomes. For example, one cannot explain both war and peace
by arguing that man is wicked" (Griffiths, 1995, p. 66). Clearly there
is another variable, without which human nature cannot suffice as the
primary cause of war. This additional variable becomes apparent in
further reading of Leviathan, specifically concerning the environment
mankind inhabits. Hobbes writes of the state of nature, "[If any two
(hu)mans desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both
enjoy, they become enemies; and in the way to their end \[...\]
endeavour to destroy, or subdue one another]{.underline}" (Hobbes, 2008,
p. 83). [While it might seem this competition for resources is an
alternative to the human nature claim to war, as will be seen, it is
only by the combination of this factor and another of human nature, that
war can be given any primary cause]{.underline}. It must be argued that
the base requirements for mankind's survival are of such significance to
human nature that the competition for these be included in its very
definition. [Survival, dependent first and foremost on the securing of
these resources, and secondly on their protection, is integral to the
causation of wars.]{.underline} However, there remains another question:
[why when two actors desire the same thing, does co-operation not play a
greater role? The answer is again found deeply embedded in one of the
facets of (hu)man]{.underline}. As Hobbes observed, there is a great
distrust among men. [That a (hu)man need fear those "prepared with
forces united to dispossess and deprive them, not only of the fruit of
their labour, but also of their life or liberty]{.underline}", is cause
for him to "master the persons of all men he can so long till he see no
other power great enough to endanger him" (Hobbes, 2008, p. 57). In
Realist terms, this is known as the "security dilemma" (Waltz, 2001, p.
37), and is sourced from the knowledge that one can never know the true
intentions of another, and so can rely only on oneself. [The same is
true for states, which are again proven to be "(hu)man writ
large"]{.underline} in the words of Morgenthau (Griffiths, 1995, p. 66).
John Mearsheimer refers to this as the "uncertainty of intentions", and
as a facet of human nature it has had disastrous consequences, most
prominently in the beginning of the First World War. There had been an
arms race in 1912 and 1913 all throughout Europe (Mulligan, 2010, p.
209) and when combined with high diplomatic tensions, and the scramble
by Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia and France to mobilise (Martel,
2003, pp. 2-3), a situation arose in which, states were unsure that
"other states \[did\] not have offensive intentions to go along with
their offensive capabilities" (Mearsheimer, 2003, p. 31). The likelihood
of war here as a direct result of limitations imposed by human nature
was irreversibly heightened, and the significance of this insurmountable
fear---only dampened by defence spending---this limitation generates was
exposed. Mearsheimer's analysis, going further than the traditional
Realist's, concludes similarly to Hobbes', that the only way to maintain
security is to muster a power so great that no other can contest your
strength. Writing on German eagerness for war in 1914, he claims it was
"not a case of wacky strategic ideas pushing a state to start a war it
was sure to lose" but "a calculated risk, motivated in large part by
Germany's desire to \[...\] become Europe's hegemon" (Mearsheimer, 2003,
p. 214). Here it can be seen that no matter how complex a state's
policy, its own ability to procure and defend resources---defined in
terms of power---is always the primary aim. As Morgenthau writes on
power "whatever the ultimate aims of international politics, power is
always the immediate aim" (Morgenthau, 2006, p. 29). Now that [a
culpable human nature has been established]{.underline}, it is now time
to see where it stands among other theories of the causes of war.

#### **War is biologically engrained in human nature**

writer. June 12^th^ 2021 "Is War Inevitable?" Liveright Publishing

Cayden Mayer

"[History is a bath of blood]{.underline}," wrote William James, whose
1906 antiwar essay is arguably the best ever written on the subject.
"Modern man inherits all the innate pugnacity and all the love of glory
of his ancestors. Showing war's irrationality and horror is of no effect
on him. The horrors make the fascination. War is the strong life; it is
life in extremis; war taxes are the only ones men never hesitate to pay,
as the budgets of all nations show us." [Our bloody nature, it can now
be argued in the context of modern biology, is ingrained because
group-versus-group competition was a principal driving force that made
us what we are.]{.underline} In prehistory, group selection (that is,
the competition between tribes instead of between individuals) lifted
the hominids that became territorial carnivores to heights of
solidarity, to genius, to enterprise---and to fear[. Each tribe knew
with justification that if it was not armed and ready, its very
existence was imperiled]{.underline}. Throughout history, the escalation
of a large part of technology has had combat as its central purpose.
Today the calendars of nations are punctuated by holidays to celebrate
wars won and to perform memorial services for those who died waging
them. Public support is best fired up by appeal to the emotions of
deadly combat, over which the amygdala---a center for primary emotion in
the brain---is grandmaster. [We find ourselves in the "battle" to stem
an oil spill, the "fight" to tame inflation, the "war" against cancer.
Wherever there is an enemy, animate or inanimate, there must be a
victory]{.underline}. You must prevail at the front, no matter how high
the cost at home. Any excuse for a real war will do, so long as it is
seen as necessary to protect the tribe. The remembrance of past horrors
has no effect. From April to June in 1994, killers from the Hutu
majority in Rwanda set out to exterminate the Tutsi minority, which at
that time ruled the country. In a hundred days of unrestrained slaughter
by knife and gun, 800,000 people died, mostly Tutsi. The total Rwandan
population was reduced by 10 percent. When a halt was finally called, 2
million Hutu fled the country, fearing retribution. The immediate causes
for the bloodbath were political and social grievances, but they all
stemmed from one root cause: Rwanda was the most overcrowded country in
Africa. For a relentlessly growing population, the per capita arable
land was shrinking toward its limit. The deadly argument was over which
tribe would own and control the whole of it. Universal conflict  Once a
group has been split off from other groups and sufficiently dehumanized,
any brutality can be justified, at any level, and at any size of the
victimized group up to and including race and nation. And so it has ever
been. A familiar fable is told to symbolize this pitiless dark angel of
human nature. A scorpion asks a frog to ferry it across a stream. The
frog at first refuses, saying that it fears the scorpion will sting it.
The scorpion assures the frog it will do no such thing. After all, it
says, we will both perish if I sting you. The frog consents, and halfway
across the stream the scorpion stings it. Why did you do that, the frog
asks as they both sink beneath the surface. It is my nature, the
scorpion explains. [War, often accompanied by genocide, is not a
cultural artifact of just a few societies]{.underline}. Nor has it been
an aberration of history, a result of the growing pains of our species'
maturation. [Wars and genocide have been universal and eternal,
respecting no particular time or culture. Archaeological]{.underline}
sites are strewn with the evidence of mass conflicts and burials of
massacred people. Tools from the earliest Neolithic period, about 10,000
years ago, include instruments clearly designed for fighting. One might
think that the influence of pacific Eastern religions, especially
Buddhism, has been consistent in opposing violence. Such is not the
case. Whenever Buddhism dominated and became the official ideology, war
was tolerated and even pressed as part of faith-based state policy. The
rationale is simple, and has its mirror image in Christianity: Peace,
nonviolence, and brotherly love are core values, but a threat to
Buddhist law and civilization is an evil that must be defeated. Since
the end of World War II, violent conflict between states has declined
drastically, owing in part to the nuclear standoff of the major powers
(two scorpions in a bottle writ large). But civil wars, insurgencies,
and state-sponsored terrorism continue unabated. Overall, big wars have
been replaced around the world by small wars of the kind and magnitude
more typical of hunter-gatherer and primitively agricultural societies[.
Civilized societies have tried to eliminate torture, execution, and the
murder of civilians, but those fighting little wars do not
comply.]{.underline} Archaeologists have determined that after
populations of Homo sapiens began to spread out of Africa approximately
60,000 years ago, the first wave reached as far as New Guinea and
Australia. The descendants of the pioneers remained as hunter-gatherers
or at most primitive agriculturalists, until reached by Europeans.
Living populations of similar early provenance and archaic cultures are
the aboriginals of Little Andaman Island off the east coast of India,
the Mbuti Pygmies of Central Africa, and the !Kung Bushmen of southern
Africa. All today, or at least within historical memory, have exhibited
aggressive territorial behavior.

### Alt Fails -- AT: Movements

#### Activist movements fail -- they can't produce concrete alternatives.

Telegraph\'s \'Top 100 Most Influential People on the Left\' for 2011,

My first experience of police kettling was aged 16. It was May Day 2001,
and the anti-globalisation movement was at its peak. The
turn-of-the-century anti-capitalist movement feels largely forgotten
today, but it was a big deal at the time. To a left-wing teenager
growing up in an age of unchallenged neo-liberal triumphalism, just to
have \"anti-capitalism\" flash up in the headlines was thrilling.
Thousands of apparently unstoppable protesters chased the world\'s
rulers from IMF to World Bank summits -- from Seattle to Prague to Genoa
-- and the authorities were rattled.¶ [Today, as protesters in nearly a
thousand cities across the world follow the example set by]{.underline}
the [Occupy]{.underline} Wall Street protests, [it\'s worth pondering
what happened to the anti-globalisation movement]{.underline}. Its
[activists did not lack passion or determination. But they did **lack a
coherent alternative** to the neo-liberal project.]{.underline} [With no
clear political direction, **the movement was easily swept away**
by]{.underline} the [jingoism and turmoil that followed
9/11,]{.underline} just two months after Genoa.¶ Don\'t get me wrong:
the Occupy movement is a glimmer of sanity amid today\'s economic
madness. By descending on the West\'s financial epicentres, it reminds
us of how a crisis caused by the banks (a sentence that needs to be
repeated until it becomes a cliché) has been cynically transformed into
a crisis of public spending. The founding statement of Occupy London
puts it succinctly: \"We refuse to pay for the banks\' crisis.\" The
Occupiers direct their fire at the top 1 per cent, and rightly so -- as
US billionaire Warren Buffett confessed: \"There\'s class warfare, all
right, but it\'s my class, the rich class, that\'s making war, and
we\'re winning.\"¶ The Occupy movement has provoked fury from senior US
Republicans such as Presidential contender Herman Cain who --
predictably -- labelled it \"anti-American\". They\'re right to be
worried: those camping outside banks threaten to refocus attention on
the real villains, and to act as a catalyst for wider dissent. [But a
coherent alternative to the tottering global economic order remains, it
seems, **as distant as ever**]{.underline}. [¶ Neo-liberalism crashes
around, half-dead, with no-one to administer the killer
blow.¶]{.underline} There\'s always a presumption that a crisis of
capitalism is good news for the left. Yet in the Great Depression,
fascism consumed much of Europe. The economic crisis of the 1970s did
lead to a resurgence of radicalism on both left and right. But,
spearheaded by Thatcherism and Reaganism, the New Right definitively
crushed its opposition in the 1980s.[This time round, there **doesn\'t
even seem to be an alternative for the right to defeat.**]{.underline}
That\'s not the fault of the protesters. In truth, [the left has never
recovered from being virtually **smothered out of
existence**]{.underline}. [It was the victim of a perfect storm: the
rise of the New Right; neo-liberal globalisation; and the]{.underline}
repeated [defeats suffered by the trade union movement.]{.underline}¶
But, above all, it was the aftermath of the collapse of Communism that
did for the left[. As US neo-conservative]{.underline} Midge [Decter
triumphantly put it: \"It\'s time to say: We\'ve won.
Goodbye]{.underline}.\" From the British Labour Party to the African
National Congress, left-wing movements across the world hurtled to the
right in an almost synchronised fashion. [It was as though the left wing
of the global political spectrum had been sliced off. That\'s
why]{.underline}, **[although we live in an age of revolt, there remains
no left to give it direction and purpose.]{.underline}**

### Policy Focus Good

#### The plan's [policy-relevant]{.underline} and [consequentialist]{.underline} framing is [more effective]{.underline}

Matthew **Bolton 16**, assistant professor of political science at Pace
University; and Elizabeth Minor, researcher at UK‐based NGO Article 36,
September 2016, "The Discursive Turn Arrives in Turtle Bay: The
International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons' Operationalization of
Critical IR Theories," Global Policy, Vol. 7, No. 3, p. 385-395

Within the IR literature [there is a perennial admonition to **make
theory more 'relevant' to policy makers**]{.underline}, but this is
usually cast in problem‐solving terms: producing knowledge that solves
the problems faced by the existing political framework. (Lepgold, 1998;
Eriksson and Sundelius, 2005; Walt, 2005). Many of [those engaged in
critical theorizing resist]{.underline} such [demands to be 'useful,'
suspicious of]{.underline} the operationalization of [academic work in
oppressive systems]{.underline}, and tend towards a position of
'resistance' to the system as a whole. Critical security studies scholar
Anna Stavrianakis (2012, p. 233) for example, calls on disarmament
activists to demand 'transgressive change that fundamentally alters the
social landscape as well as generates concrete improvements' rather than
calling for 'incremental changes that leave the parameters of an issue
untouched'. Given the centrality of discourse to critical theorizing,
[resistance is often framed **not in terms of**]{.underline} taking
territory, mobilizing bodies, **[changing legislation]{.underline}**,
gaining votes or raising money. Rather [it tends to focus on
the]{.underline} critical [deconstruction of oppressive discourse and
disruption of existing norms]{.underline} (e.g. Hargreaves, 2012). As a
result, many [critical IR scholars see their academic work]{.underline}
-- undermining dominant discourses through [their
scholarship]{.underline} and teaching -- [as their primary form of
resistance]{.underline}. (Said, 1996).¶ An emerging generation of
political actors were educated by post‐positivist and critical IR
scholars and conceive of their work self‐consciously in discursive
terms. That is, they frame their intervention in the political arena as
a deliberate attempt to reshape the way society speaks about and gives
meaning to a particular phenomenon, people, group or activity. Occupy
Wall Street activists drew upon critical and discursive theories to
strategize their symbolic disruption of the neo‐liberal order (Welty,
2013). LGBTQA activists and 'third wave' feminists are trying to change
dominant discourses of gender and sexuality (e.g. St. Pierre, 2000).
However, [critical theory has had **less impact** on]{.underline} the
realm of [international military and security policy, which remains
heavily influenced by realist thought]{.underline} (Cooper, 2006).¶ As
critical theorizing has begun to be used for solving definable political
problems (e.g. Davies, 2012; Merlingen, 2013), what Brown (2013) calls
'[critical problem‐solving theory']{.underline}, it [has
eroded]{.underline} Cox\'s (1981) [boundary between 'problem‐solving'
and critical theories]{.underline}. What happens when a theoretical
paradigm that explicitly defines itself in critical opposition is
instrumentalized and used in problem‐solving ways? This question, which
we begin to explore in this article, is underexamined in the literature
(see Weizman, 2012, pp. 185--220 for an important exception).¶ According
to the epistemic community literature (e.g. Haas 2004), the [education
of policy makers can shape their later actions]{.underline} (Eriksson
and Sundelius, 2005). Most usefully for this article, it shows how [at
critical junctures policy makers will turn to experts. Policy makers
tend to be less interested in meta‐theory or broad academic
debates]{.underline} about an issue. Rather, [they look for knowledge
that can be **used instrumentally to solve a particular policy
problem**]{.underline} (e.g. Hall, 1993). [But moving theoretical ideas
from academia, through the activist community, to the policy arena,
dilutes the original ideas and reinterprets them in instrumental
ways]{.underline}. To help understand this, we draw on postcolonial
concepts of 'translation' and 'creolization' of different 'knowledge
systems' pushed into contact (Shih and Lionet, 2011, p. 30). We find
that some ICAN [campaigners]{.underline} responsible for its current
strategy [have 'translated' IR discursive theory into the world of
disarmament policy making]{.underline}. In doing so, [they selected the
aspects of critical security studies 'to transpose and
emphasize']{.underline} (cf. Tymoczko, 2000 p. 24) [as befit their
specific political goals. This creative application of critical theory
in a new setting]{.underline}, in its translation of theory into
political engagement, [may necessarily involve rendering it **less
threatening to elite audiences**, in the process of **seeking policy
changes**]{.underline} (cf. Jeffrey, 2013, pp. 107--131).

#### Policymakers must take national interest above all other interests\-\--it's the only ethical option

William F. **Felice 2008**, Professor of international political
economy, international law, international organization, and human rights
at New York University, "Moral Responsibility in a Time of War", Social
Justice/Global Options, https://www.jstor.org/stable/29768499

Ethics, also known as moral philosophy, attempts to distinguish between
right and wrong behavior[. Ethical theories have been applied to war and
violence with \"just war\" theories influencing
policymakers]{.underline}. However, [the **intellectual framework used
by** the overwhelming majority of the world\'s **foreign policy
decision-makers is** an \"amoral\" calculation of **what action best
serves the \"national interest**]{.underline}.\" [The first-rate foreign
policy expert will give absolute priority to the interests of his or her
nation, which often means neglecting and opposing the material interests
of those outside this partial community. Through this lens, **policy
options pose few moral dilemmas**, as these decisions are merely
practical solutions to real-world problems]{.underline}. Some who call
themselves \"[political realists\" share such a view of the separation
of ethics from politics. ¶]{.underline} To a classical political
realist, history demonstrates that states must focus on power and wealth
to survive in the international system. Morality has a limited role to
play in this anarchical, dangerous world. Since the time of Thucydides
in ancient Greece, states have consistently chosen power over negotiated
diplomatic agreements, with the \"logic of fear and escalation\" always
pushing out the \"logic of moderation and peaceful diplomacy.\" This
overriding priority of \"national security\" means that ethics plays an
extremely circumscribed role in the deliberations of states. Many
realists argue that in international politics \"only the weak resort to¶
moral argument\" (Smith, 1986: 6-7). ¶ [Many powerful officials in the
U.S. government have stated strongly that, in their view, moral
considerations have no place in politics.]{.underline} For example, Dean
Acheson, former secretary of state under President Harry Truman, was
asked by President Kennedy in 1962 to serve on the Executive Committee
to advise the president on an appropriate response to the Cuban missile
crisis. Acheson later wrote that during these discussions, when the
lives of millions of people were in danger, \"those involved\...will
remember the irrelevance of the supposed moral considerations brought
out in the discussions\...moral talk did not bear on the problem\"
(Acheson, 1971; Coady, 1993: 373). [Realist counsel has traditionally
excluded morality from foreign policy]{.underline} and instead focused
solely on the \"national interest.\" Yet, this does not mean that no
ethics apply to statecraft. Rather, a difference is accepted in the
morals that apply to individuals versus those that apply to the state.
An individual can base his or her conduct on principles such as honesty
and nonviolence. In contrast, the state must protect its position of
\"power\" in the international system. This means that the state should
not engage in ideological crusades for democracy and freedom that could
dilute its power. Yet key \"realist\" virtues enhance the state\'s power
position and thus must be embraced. These ethical norms are said to
include prudence, humility, study, responsibility, and patriotism. Such
an approach allows leaders to conduct a responsible and tough defense of
the national interest, but still show respect for others. The claim made
for the cosmopolitan significance of this realist approach has been
named \"ethical realism.\" \"Ethical realism,\" according to Lieven and
Hulsman (2006: 62-83), \"is therefore of universal and eternal value for
the conduct of international affairs, and especially useful as a guiding
philosophy for the United States and its war on terror.\"¶ As a
representative of the community overall, [**the government official has
a primary obligation to the national interest**, and, in particular, the
security and integrity of the state]{.underline}. The ethics of
\"humility\" and \"prudence\" can help to protect the security of the
state. However, [the necessities of national existence cannot be sorted
out through an ethical lens of right and wrong conduct]{.underline}.
Effective statecraft demands that officials act to protect the whole,
even if individual and collective moral principles are sacrificed.
**[The government official must protect the interests of the community
above all else.]{.underline}** As [a result, according to international
relations theorist Hans Morgenthau (1979: 13), there is a \"difference
in the moral principles that apply to the private citizen in his
relations with other private citizens and to the public figure in
dealing with other public figures.]{.underline}\" Many of these
\"political realists\" and/or \"ethical realists\" seem to embrace
Machiavelli's division of morality between the public and private
worlds.

## Turns

### Militarism Good Turn

#### Militarism is good- military deterrence and the willingness to use force will save more lives

Victor Davis **Hanson 04,** Professor of Classical Studies at CSU
Fresno, "The Fruits of Appeasement", City Journal, Spring 2004,
http://www.cityjournal.org/html/14_2_the_fruits.html

[The twentieth century should have taught the citizens of liberal
democracies the catastrophic consequences of placating
tyrants]{.underline}. British and French [restraint over
the]{.underline} occupation of the Rhineland, the
[Anschluss]{.underline}, the absorption of the Czech Sudetenland, and
the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia [did not win gratitude but
rather Hitler's contempt for their weakness. Fifty million dead, the
Holocaust]{.underline}, [and the near destruction of European
civilization were the wages of "appeasement"]{.underline}---a term that
early-1930s liberals proudly embraced as far more enlightened than the
old idea of "deterrence" and "military readiness."

[So too did Western excuses for the Russians' violation of guarantees of
free elections in postwar Eastern Europe]{.underline}, China, and
Southeast Asia [only embolden the Soviet Union]{.underline}. [What
eventually contained Stalinism was the Truman Doctrine, NATO, and
nuclear deterrence---not the United Nations---and what destroyed its
legacy was Ronald Reagan's assertiveness, not Jimmy Carter's
accommodation or Richard Nixon's détente]{.underline}.

As long ago as the fourth century b.c., Demosthenes warned how
complacency and self-delusion among an affluent and free Athenian people
allowed a Macedonian thug like Philip II to end some four centuries of
Greek liberty---and in a mere 20 years of creeping aggrandizement down
the Greek peninsula. Thereafter, [these historical lessons should have
been clear to citizens of any liberal society: we must neither presume
that comfort and security are our birthrights and are guaranteed without
constant sacrifice and vigilance, nor expect that peoples outside the
purview of bourgeois liberalism share our commitment to reason,
tolerance, and enlightened self-interest.]{.underline}

[Most important, military deterrence and the willingness to use force
against evil in its infancy usually end up, in the terrible arithmetic
of war, saving more lives than they cost]{.underline}. All this can be a
hard lesson to relearn each generation, especially now that we contend
with the sirens of the mall, Oprah, and latte. Our affluence and leisure
are as antithetical to the use of force as rural life and relative
poverty once were catalysts for muscular action. [The age-old lure of
appeasement---perhaps they will cease with this latest concession,
perhaps we provoked our enemies, perhaps demonstrations of our future
good intentions will win their approval---was never more evident than in
the recent Spanish elections, when an affluent European electorate,
reeling from the horrific terrorist attack of 3/11, swept from power the
pro-U.S. center-right government on the grounds that the mass murders
were more the fault of the United States]{.underline} for dragging Spain
into the effort to remove fascists and implant democracy in Iraq
[than]{.underline} of the primordial [al-Qaidist culprits]{.underline},
who long ago promised the Western and Christian Iberians ruin for the
Crusades and the Reconquista.

#### Militarism is key to leadership and preserving order to check those who threaten the world order

David **Brooks 01**, a Canadian-born American political and cultural
commentator who writes for The New York Times, "Age of conflict,"
November 5, 2001,
https://www.weeklystandard.com/david-brooks/the-age-of-conflict

Obviously nobody knows what the future years will feel like, but we do
know that the next decade will have a central feature that was lacking
in the last one: The next few years will be defined by conflict. And
it\'s possible to speculate about what that means. [**The institutions
that fight for us and defend us against disorder \-- the military, the
FBI, the CIA \-- will seem more important and more admirable. The
fundamental arguments won\'t be over economic or social issues, they
will be over how to wield power \-- whether to use American power
aggressively or circumspectly. We will care a lot more about ends \--
winning the war \-- than we will about means.**]{.underline} We will
debate whether it is necessary to torture prisoners who have information
about future biological attacks. We will destroy innocent villages by
accident, shrug our shoulders, and continue fighting. In an age of
conflict, bourgeois virtues like compassion, tolerance, and
industriousness are valued less than the classical virtues of courage,
steadfastness, and a ruthless desire for victory. \[...continues...\]
But now violence has come calling. Now it is no longer possible to live
so comfortably in one\'s own private paradise. [Shocked out of the
illusion of self-reliance, most of us realize that we, as individuals,
simply cannot protect ourselves. **Private life requires public
protection.** Now it is not possible to ignore foreign affairs, because
foreign affairs have not ignored us. It has become clear that we are
living in a world in which **hundreds of millions of people hate us**,
and some small percentage of them **want to destroy us**]{.underline}.
That realization is bound to have cultural effects. In the first place,
we will probably become more conscious of our American-ness. During the
blitz in 1940, George Orwell sat in his bomb shelter and wrote an essay
called \"England Your England.\" It opened with this sentence: \"As I
write, highly civilised human beings are flying overhead, trying to kill
me.\" What struck him at that moment of danger was that it really does
matter whether you are English or German. The nation is a nursemaid that
breeds certain values and a certain ethos. Orwell went on to describe
what it meant to be English. Now Americans are being killed simply
because they are Americans. Like Orwell, Americans are once again
becoming aware of themselves as a nationality, not just as members of
some ethnic community or globalized Internet chat group. Americans have
been reminded that, despite what the multiculturalists have been
preaching, [not all cultures are wonderfully equal hues in the great
rainbow of humanity. Some national cultures, the ones that have
inherited certain ideas \-- about freedom and democracy, the limits of
the political claims of religion, the importance of tolerance and
dissent \-- are **more humane** than other civilizations, which reject
those ideas]{.underline}. As criticism of our war effort grows in
Europe, in hostile Arab countries, and in two-faced countries like Egypt
and Saudi Arabia, which dislike our principles but love our dollars,
Americans will have to articulate a defense of our national principles
and practices. That debate in itself will shape American culture. We
will begin to see ourselves against the backdrop of the Taliban. During
the Cold War, we saw ourselves in contrast to the Soviet Union. Back
then, we faced a godless foe; now we are facing a god-crazed foe. As we
recoil from the Islamic extremists, we may be less willing to integrate
religion into political life. That would mean trouble for faith-based
initiatives and religion in the public square. On the other hand,
democracies tend to become patriotic during wartime, if history is any
guide, and this will drive an even deeper wedge between regular
Americans and the intellectual class. Literary critic Paul Fussell, a
great student of American culture in times of war, wrote a book,
Wartime, on the cultural effects of World War II. Surveying the culture
of that period, he endorsed the view of historian Eileen Sullivan, who
wrote, \"[**There was no room in this war culture for individual
opinions or personalities, no freedom of dissent or approval; the
culture was homogeneous, shallow and boring**.\"]{.underline}
\[...continues...\] Don\'t make the mistake of interpreting the events
of Sept. 11 purely in terms of terrorism and murder. . . . The
terrorists are a virulent subset of a much larger group of
anticapitalists, one that includes many politicians, bureaucrats,
writers, media types, academics, entertainers, trade unionists and, at
times, church leaders. The barbarians at the gates are more numerous
than you thought. But the most important cultural effect of conflict is
that it breeds a certain bloody-mindedness or, to put it more grandly, a
tragic view of life. Life in times of war and recession reminds us of
certain hard truths that were easy to ignore during the decade of peace
and prosperity. [**Evil exists.** Difficulties, even tragedies, are
**inevitable**. Human beings are flawed creatures capable of
monstrosity. Not all cultures are compatible**. To preserve order, good
people must exercise power over destructive people.**]{.underline} That
means that [it\'s no longer sufficient to deconstruct ideas and texts
and signifiers**. You have to be able to construct hard principles so
you can move from one idea to the next**, because when you are faced
with the problem of repelling evil, you absolutely must be able to reach
a conclusion on serious moral issues.]{.underline} This means you need
to think in moral terms about force \-- and to be tough-minded. During
the Cold War, Reinhold Niebuhr was a major intellectual figure. In 1952,
he wrote The Irony of American History. The tragedy of the conflict with
communism, he argued, was that, \"though confident of its virtue,
**[\[America\] must yet hold atomic bombs ready for use so as to prevent
a possible world conflagration]{.underline}**.\" The irony of our
history, he continued, is that we are an idealistic nation that dreams
of creating a world of pure virtue, yet in defeating our enemies we
sometimes have to act in ways that are not pure. \"We take, and must
continue to take, morally hazardous action to preserve our
civilization,\" Niebuhr wrote. \"**[We must exercise our
power]{.underline}**.\" We have to do so while realizing that we will
not be capable of perfect disinterestedness when deciding which actions
are just. We will be influenced by dark passions. **[But we still have
to act forcefully because our enemies are trying to destroy the basis of
civilization: \"We are drawn into an historic situation in which the
paradise of our domestic security is suspended in a hell of global
insecurity]{.underline}**.\" Niebuhr\'s prescription was humble
hawkishness. He believed the United States should forcefully defend
freedom and destroy its enemies. But while doing so, it should seek
forgiveness for the horrible things it might have to do in a worthy
cause. To reach this graduate-school level of sophistication, you have
to have passed through elementary courses in moral reasoning. It will be
interesting to see whether we Americans, who sometimes seem unsure of
even the fundamental moral categories, can educate ourselves
sufficiently to engage in the kind of moral reasoning that Niebuhr did.
The greatest political effect of this period of conflict will probably
be to relegitimize central institutions. Since we can\'t defend
ourselves as individuals against terrorism, we have to rely on the
institutions of government: the armed forces, the FBI, the CIA, the CDC,
and so on. We are now only beginning to surrender some freedoms, but we
will trade in more, and willingly. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in the
Federalist Papers, \"Safety from external danger is the most powerful
director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will,
after a time, give way to its dictates. . . . To be more safe,
\[people\] at length become willing to run the risk of being less
free.\" Moreover, we will see power migrate from the states and Capitol
Hill to the White House. \"It is of the nature of war to increase the
executive at the expense of the legislative authority,\" Hamilton
continued. This creates rifts on both left and right, because both
movements contain anti-establishment elements hostile to any effort to
relegitimize central authorities. The splits have been most spectacular
on the left. Liberals who work in politics \-- Democrats on Capitol
Hill, liberal activists, academics who are interested in day-to-day
politics \-- almost all support President Bush and the war effort. But
many academic and literary leftists, ranging from Eric Foner to Susan
Sontag to Noam Chomsky, have been sour, critical, and contemptuous of
America\'s response to September 11. The central difference is that the
political liberals are comfortable with power. They want power
themselves and do not object to the central institutions of government,
even the military, exercising power on our behalf. Many [literary and
academic liberals, on the other hand, have built a whole moral system
around powerlessness.]{.underline} They champion the outgroups. [They
stand with the victims of hegemony, patriarchy, colonialism, and all the
other manifestations of central authority. Sitting on their campuses,
they are powerless themselves]{.underline}, and have embraced a
delicious, self-glorifying identity as the out-manned sages who alone
can see through the veils of propaganda in which the powerful hide their
oppressive schemes. For these thinkers, virtue inheres in the powerless.
The weak are sanctified, not least because they are voiceless and
allegedly need academics to give them voices. These outgroup leftists
dislike the Taliban, but to ally themselves with American power would be
to annihilate everything they have stood for and the role they have
assigned themselves in society. \[...continues...\] For Bush, the leader
of the free world, the issue is terrorism, not street crime. But now he
too is engaged in the effort to restore order so that people can go
about their lives. He is the one rounding up the posse, forsaking social
issues and other moral debates for a straightforward act of
international prosecution. He is reasserting authority to show that
under Pax Americana, the world is governable. \[...continues...\] But
history never repeats itself neatly. No one can predict the political
and cultural consequences of a war, any more than the course of the war
itself. But it does seem clear that we have moved out of one political
and cultural moment and into another. We have traded the anxieties of
affluence for the real fears of war. We have moved from an age of peace
to an age of conflict, and in times of conflict people are different.
They go to extremes. Some people, and some nations, turn cowardly or
barbaric. Other people, and other nations, become heroic, brave, and
steadfast. It all depends on what they have in them. War isn\'t only, as
Bourne said, the health of the state. It\'s the gut-check of the nation.

### Securitization Turn

#### New security frameworks and a move away from securitization causes the state to become more interventionist---turns the K

Tara **McCormack, '10**, Lecturer in International Politics at the
University of Leicester, 2010, (Critique, Security and Power: The
political limits to emancipatory approaches, page 127-129)

The following section will briefly raise some questions about the
[rejection of the old security framework]{.underline} as it has been
taken up by the most powerful institutions and states. [Here we can
begin to see the political limits to critical and emancipatory
frameworks]{.underline}. In an international system which is marked by
great power inequalities between states, the [rejection of
the]{.underline} old narrow national [interest-based security
framework]{.underline} by major international institutions, [and the
adoption of]{.underline} ostensibly [emancipatory policies]{.underline}
and policy rhetoric, [has the consequence of **problematising weak or
unstable states** and allowing international institutions or major
states **a more interventionary role**]{.underline}, yet [without
establishing mechanisms by which the citizens of states being intervened
in might have any control over the agents or agencies of their
emancipation]{.underline}. [Whatever the problems associated with the
pluralist security framework **there were at least formal and clear
demarcations**]{.underline}. [This has the consequence of **entrenching
international power inequalities** and allowing for a shift towards a
hierarchical international order in which the citizens in weak or
unstable states may arguably have even less freedom or power than
before]{.underline}. Radical critics of contemporary security policies,
such as human security and humanitarian intervention, argue that we see
an assertion of Western power and the creation of liberal subjectivities
in the developing world. For example, see Mark Duffield's important and
insightful contribution to the ongoing debates about contemporary
international security and development. Duffield attempts to provide a
coherent empirical engagement with, and theoretical explanation of,
these shifts. Whilst these shifts, away from a focus on state security,
and the so-called merging of security and development are often
portrayed as positive and progressive shifts that have come about
because of the end of the Cold War, Duffield argues convincingly that
these shifts are highly problematic and unprogressive. For example, the
rejection of sovereignty as formal international equality and a
presumption of nonintervention has eroded the division between the
international and domestic spheres and led to an international
environment in which Western NGOs and powerful states have a major role
in the governance of third world states. Whilst for supporters of
humanitarian intervention this is a good development, [Duffield points
out the depoliticising implications, drawing on examples in Mozambique
and Afghanistan]{.underline}. [Duffield also draws out the problems of
the retreat from modernisation that is represented by sustainable
development]{.underline}. The Western world has moved away from the
development policies of the Cold War, which aimed to develop third world
states industrially. Duffield describes this in terms of a new division
of human life into uninsured and insured life. Whilst we in the West are
'insured' -- that is we no longer have to be entirely self-reliant, we
have welfare systems, a modern division of labour and so on --
sustainable development aims to teach populations in poor states how to
survive in the absence of any of this. [Third world populations must be
taught to be self-reliant, they will remain uninsured. Self-reliance of
course means **the condemnation of millions to** **a barbarous life of
inhuman bare survival**.]{.underline} Ironically, although sustainable
development is celebrated by many on the left today, by leaving people
to fend for themselves rather than developing a society wide system
which can support people, [sustainable development actually leads to a
less human and humane system than that developed in modern capitalist
states]{.underline}. Duffield also describes how many of these
problematic shifts are embodied in the contemporary concept of human
security. For Duffield, [we can understand these shifts in terms of
Foucauldian biopolitical framework]{.underline}, which can be understood
as [a regulatory power that seeks to support life through intervening in
the biological, social and economic processes that constitute a human
population]{.underline} (2007: 16). Sustainable development and human
security are for Duffield technologies of security which aim to *create*
self-managing and self-reliant subjectivities in the third world, which
can then survive in a situation of serious underdevelopment (or being
uninsured as Duffield terms it) without causing security problems for
the developed world. For Duffield this is all driven by a neoliberal
project which seeks to control and manage uninsured populations
globally. Radical critic Costas Douzinas (2007) also criticises new
forms of cosmopolitanism such as human rights and interventions for
human rights as a triumph of American hegemony. Whilst we are in
agreement with critics such as Douzinas and Duffield that [these new
security frameworks cannot be empowering, and ultimately lead to more
power for powerful sta**tes**,]{.underline} we need to understand why
these frameworks have the effect that they do. We can understand that
these frameworks have political limitations without having to look for a
specific plan on the part of current powerful states. In new security
frameworks such as human security we can see the political limits of the
framework proposed by critical and emancipatory theoretical approaches.

### Interventionism Good Turn

#### US interventionism is good -- it's the [only alternative]{.underline} to [mass death]{.underline}.

the Humanities and Council on Foreign Relations, Summer, "A New Age of
Liberal Imperialism?" World Policy Journal, Vol XVI No 2,

Finessing the Disaster And yet [in Kosovo]{.underline} (this had almost
happened in Bosnia), [the West was finally hoist on the petard of its
own lip service to the categorical imperative of human rights. It was
ashamed not to intervene, but it lacked the will to do so with either
vision or coherence]{.underline}. Kosovo is probably a lost cause; it is
certainly ruined for a generation, whatever eventual deal is worked out,
as Bosnia, whose future is to be a ward of NATO, America, and the
European Union, probably for decades, has also been ruined for a
generation, Dayton or no Dayton. What remains are the modalities through
which this disaster can be finessed, and its consequences mitigated. [It
is to be hoped that in the wake of Kosovo, the realization that this
kind of geo-strategic frivolity and ad hoc-ism, this resolve to act out
of moral paradigms that now command the sympathy but do not yet command
the deep allegiance of Western public opinion-at least not to the extent
that people are willing to sacrifice in order to see that they are
upheld-will no longer do.]{.underline} [To say this is **not to suggest
that there are any obvious alternatives**.]{.underline} Even if one
accepts more of its premises than I do, the human rights perspective
clearly is insufficient. As for [the United Nations]{.underline}, it
[has been shown to be **incapable** of playing the dual role of both
succoring populations at risk while simultaneously acting like a
colonial power and imposing some kind of order and rebuilding civic
institutions. The important Third World countries seem to have **neither
the resources nor the ideological inclination to intervene** even in
their own regions, as Africa\'s failure to act in Rwanda in 1994
demonstrated so painfully]{.underline}. [The conclusion is
inescapable]{.underline}. At the present time, **[only the West has both
the power and]{.underline}**, however intermittently, [**the readiness
to act**. And by the West, one]{.underline} really [means the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. Obviously, to say that America
could act effectively if it chose to do so as, yes, the world\'s
policeman of last resort, is not the same thing as saying that it
should. Those who argue, as George Kennan has done, that we overestimate
ourselves when we believe we can right the wrongs of the world, must be
listened to seriously. So should the views of principled isolationists.
And those on what remains of the left who insist that the result of such
a broad licensing of American power will be a further entrenchment of
America\'s hegemony over the rest of the world are also unquestionably
correct. What Is to Be Done But [the implications of not doing anything
are]{.underline} equally [clear. **Those who fear American power
are**]{.underline}-this is absolutely certain-[**condemning other people
to death**. Had the U.S. armed forces not set up the air bridge to
eastern Zaire in the wake of the Rwandan genocide, **hundreds of
thousands of people would have perished**]{.underline}, rather than the
tens of thousands who did die. This does not excuse the Clinton
administration for failing to act to stop the genocide militarily; but
it is a fact. [And analogous situations were found in Bosnia
and]{.underline} even, for all its failings, in the operation in
[Somalia]{.underline}.

### Perm Solvency -- Movements

#### Only the perm solves -- movements fail without showing credible political alternatives, and their anti-reformist ideological purity prevents true democracy.

[Being anti-something can be politically useful,]{.underline} but [only
**up to a point.**]{.underline} The [protesters]{.underline} of Seattle
and similar events [have been very effective in **pointing out**
authoritarian aspects of the capitalist world-system]{.underline}. Even
if various groups that have participated in these events do have
programmatic statements for alternative futures, [the way these events
have been staged has **not been very conducive in showing these futures
to the world**. The criticism of **not being able to show a credible
alternative**]{.underline}, or any alternative at all, [has become a
problem for the legitimacy of the protest movements.]{.underline}

In most of the post-Seattle events, [the protesters have often been
labeled as "antiglobalization,"]{.underline} and some of them have used
the expression themselves. 24 [It would]{.underline}, however, [be
**analytically faulty and politically unwise to simply define the
movements as being against** globalization, if the term is understood as
the increasing transgression of nation-state borders on a worldwide
level. Many of them are]{.underline}, I would claim, [looking for a
different kind of globalization]{.underline}, though some may prefer to
use the older term internationalism. From a democratic perspective, the
problem in some antiglobalization rhetoric is that one easily ends up
with rather strange bedfellows. [**Professing antiglobalization pure and
simple is not very helpful** in terms of making a distinction between
regulating the cross-border movements of speculative capital and those
of black immigrants.]{.underline}

Outra globalização (another globalization) is an expression that has
been emphasized by some of the key organizers of the Porto Alegre
meetings (Grzybowski 1998; de Souza Santos 2001). Despite their
insistence, the mass media in many parts of Latin America often talks of
antiglobalization activists when referring to both Porto Alegre and some
of the events inspired by it. The February 2001 protests related to a
WEF regional meeting in Mexico and the March 2001 marches around the
Inter- American Development Bank meeting in Santiago de Chile were the
first big globalization-related protest events in Latin America after
the first WSF, and the media coverage of them often referred to the
Porto Alegre event as an important moment in the antiglobalization
struggles.25

[For those who want to argue for the possibility of a different kind of
globalization, the risk of ending up with strange bedfellows is by no
means absent. It is not always easy to see the differences, if any, of
the "alternative" globalization proposals with the idea of many business
leaders that some democratization is necessary in order to make the
global expansion of capitalism acceptable]{.underline} (Falk and Strauss
2001). [Those who cling to antiglobalization discourse are often right
when they claim that the alternative globalization strategies would only
lead to very moderate changes. Often, but **not always.**]{.underline}

[It is frequently assumed that in the anti/alternative divide of
globalization debates, **being "anti" represents more radical and
revolutionary options, whereas the "alternatives" are on the side of
more superficial reforms**]{.underline}. [In terms of thinking about how
to democratize the world, **this assumption is not very
helpful.**]{.underline} [Within the alternative globalization specter,
it is possible to find and even easier to imagine such political
projects that strive for a globalization that radically transforms the
world. While antiglobalization people can be pro-capitalist,
pro-globalization people may be anticapitalist.]{.underline}

[Some of the debate and divide between the "anti" and the "alternative"
is due to **confused semantics or distorted categorizations**. In order
to fundamentally democratize the world, **people who have chosen to
regard globalization as a term that has been too polluted by its
dominant usage and those who think it can still be given more
progressive meanings can often work together**]{.underline}. In
principle, the WSF offers many opportunities for this to happen.
