#### NATO degrades US security and risks nuclear war -- Europe would be better defending itself

**Bandow '15** (Doug Bandow - Bandow holds a JD from Stanford
University. He is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, specializing in
foreign policy and civil liberties. "Should the U.S. Leave NATO?" Cato
Institute. 12/7/15.
https://www.cato.org/commentary/should-us-leave-nato)

[The problem is not just NATO's recent expansion]{.underline}. [An
alliance on autopilot **ignores changes within existing
members**.]{.underline} For instance, [Turkey is proving to be another
area of confrontation that undermines U.S. and European
security.]{.underline} Never quite the geopolitical lynch‐​pin that it
was made out to be, [Ankara spent years prosecuting a brutal campaign
against Kurdish separatists]{.underline} and occupied more than
one‐​third of the Republic of Cyprus, [creating an ethnic Turkish state
recognized only by Ankara]{.underline}. Turkey turned in an ever more
authoritarian and Islamist direction once President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
dropped his early liberalizing pretensions. Ironically, he now appears
determined to create a presidency modeled after that of Vladimir Putin.
So much for NATO promoting liberal democracy. (That always was a job for
the European Union anyway.) Worse, though, is Ankara's irresponsible
shoot‐​down of the Russian plane. Even assuming that Turkey's claims as
to the Russian incursion and Turkish warnings are accurate, 17 seconds
over Turkish territory did not warrant such a deadly response. Indeed,
[Ankara routinely violates the airspace of fellow NATO member
Greece]{.underline}. That policy forces cash‐​strapped Athens to waste
its limited resources responding. One wonders at the Erdogan
government's reaction if Greece chose to down the Turkish offenders.
(NATO is talking about bolstering Turkey's air defenses against Russia;
how about aiding the Greeks against Ankara?) Of course, Turkey knew that
Russian forces have no hostile aims---indeed, none of the active
combatants, including Syria, are targeting Turkish personnel or
materiel. [Ankara may have been protecting the illicit oil trade or
insurgents in an area dominated by the al‐​Qaeda‐​linked al‐​Nusra Front,
or attempting to punish Moscow]{.underline} for backing Syria's
President Bashar al‐​Assad. [The first two undermine American
interests]{.underline}. [The latter]{.underline} might fit with an
official aim of Washington, but [runs against the more fundamental
objective of destroying the Islamic State]{.underline}. None of these
potential Turkish goals justifies allowing Ankara to drag NATO into a
war with Russia. My Cato Institute colleague Ted Galen Carpenter
suggests defenestrating this misbegotten alliance member. Striking is
how **[all of these members]{.underline}**, new and old, as well as
aspirants---the Baltic States, Georgia and Ukraine, and
Turkey---**[degrade U.S. security]{.underline}**. Montenegro, at least,
plays the harmless role of the Duchy of Fenwick in the Mouse that
Roared. Although its inclusion in the alliance will further antagonize
an already paranoid Russia, Podgorica really is irrelevant strategically
and militarily. The others are not. [In a worst case **all of them could
ensnare America in a war** with a nuclear‐​armed power over modest,
indeed, minimal, security stakes]{.underline}. The policy frankly is
mad. However, [even if Washington's NATO commitments did not bring far
more dangers than benefits, they would be unjustified. Europe
could]{.underline}, if it was so inclined, **[defend
itself]{.underline}**. Why, 70 years after the conclusion of World War
II, 26 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and 22 years after
creation of the European Union, are the Europeans still dependent on
America? Retired Gen. Robert Scales, commandant of the Army War College,
recently complained that: "At 30,000, there are fewer American soldiers
protecting Western Europe, a piece of the planet that produces 46
percent of global GDP, than there are cops in New York City." But why
can't an area that accounts for almost half of the world's production
(an overstatement, but never mind) and has a larger population than
America provide its own soldiers for defense? [Why can't an area of such
economic prowess, which has around eight times the GDP and three times
the population of its only possible antagonist, Russia, deploy an armed
force capable of deterring any threats]{.underline}? The reason the
Europeans don't do so is because [they don't want to and don't have
to]{.underline}. Some don't believe that Moscow actually poses much of a
threat. Others figure only the nations bordering Russia face any risk,
and there's little interest in "Old Europe" for confronting Moscow over
"New Europe." And almost everyone assumes America will take care of any
problems.

#### NATO provokes hostility with Russia -- we're on the brink of another cold war

**Jenkins '18** (Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist, author and BBC
broadcaster. "Donald Trump is right. Nato is a costly white elephant."
The Guardian. 7/12/18.
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/12/donald-trump-nato-costly-white-elephant-russia)

I regard Trump as an aberration, a temporary trauma afflicting US
politics. He honours the thesis of the historian Arthur Schlesinger,
that America's constitution often drives the republic to the abyss, only
to drag it back again. But even monsters can ask the occasional good
question. Thus Trump this week on Nato, a body so mired in platitude and
waffle it has lost sight of its true purpose. Trump wants to know what
Europe really regards as its defence policy, for he thinks it takes
America for a ride. [Nato was founded]{.underline} in 1949 [in response
to Stalin's blockade of Berlin. It was meant to "keep the Soviet Union
out]{.underline}, the Americans in, and the Germans down". [Since then,
it has welcomed the American nuclear shield]{.underline}, at vast cost
to America. Otherwise, [its only military achievements have been the
breakup of Yugoslavia and the loss of a squalid 17-year war in
Afghanistan]{.underline}. Neither has anything to do with the North
Atlantic. Nothing better symbolised this than Theresa May's bizarre gift
to Trump this week of 450 British troops for Kabul. Nato was about
deterring an attack on Europe from Russia. In 1945, the west agreed the
Potsdam settlement, accepting the Soviets' "sphere of influence" over
eastern Europe. Thus when Russia invaded Hungary in 1956 and
Czechoslovakia in 1968, there was no question of Nato, or Europe,
retaliating. The iron curtain was iron. Come 1989 and the collapse of
Potsdam Europe, Nato did not approach a broken Russia to agree some new
settlement. It did the opposite. To protests from Russia's weakened
leader, Boris Yeltsin, it gathered former Warsaw Pact states under its
wing and advanced its border east towards Russia. It embraced Poland,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary, then the Baltic states, Romania and
Bulgaria. It was like Khrushchev stationing missiles in Cuba. Only
Germany counselled caution. [Nato's provocation was so blatant as to be
an open invitation to any new populist leader in Moscow to exploit
Russia's bruised patriotism: hence Vladimir Putin]{.underline}. He and
his kleptocratic cronies are virtually a Nato creation. But the fact
that America was party to the provocation does not invalidate Trump's
question. [What is Nato's policy beyond needling Russia and feebly
relying on the American shield?]{.underline} , [Europe is almost back to
a cold war with Moscow]{.underline}. As winner of the last war, Nato was
primarily responsible for lowering tension and making peace. Instead it
revelled in victory. If Europe wants to hire an America nuclear shield,
it should deal with America over how to pay for it. But **[the current
tit-for-tat hostilities with Russia are playing with fire, and
counterproductive]{.underline}**. Europe's land forces are so weak they
would be wiped out by Russia in a matter of days. So is Europe really
expecting Washington to order a nuclear barrage against Russian "grey
area" incursions into the Baltics, let alone a conflict with Orbán's
Hungary or Erdoğan's Turkey -- both Nato members? [This is not
realistic]{.underline}, any more than was American intervention during
Russia's incursion in Ukraine or Georgia. That is why Orbán and Erdoğan
are wisely cosying up to Putin. [**Nato is adrift of realpolitik**.
Trump is effectively telling Europe that its Nato is as outdated as the
Congress of Vienna by the time of Bismarck.]{.underline} He is wrong to
rabbit on about spending 2% or 4% of GDP on weapons. This helps no one
but the defence industries -- spending should meet plausible threat, not
some vague budget target. [But no more helpful is Europe's belligerent
posturing towards Moscow, such as Britain's reaction to the mysterious
Wiltshire poisonings]{.underline}. Entrenching Putin behind a siege
economy is not a defence policy. Better to go down the route of detente,
recognise Russia's sphere of influence and be just a little nicer to
Putin. Whatever Trump's motives for advocating this, he is surely right.
[**A sensible Nato would have a firefighting force to handle
separatist** and frontier **squabbles such as Kosovo**, not a main force
conflict with Russia]{.underline}. [Attempts to set up a European joint
force,]{.underline} of which there have been half a dozen since the
1950s, [have been fiascos]{.underline}. Britain and France should end
their meaningless nuclear deterrents. Their submarines, aircraft
carriers and fighters are costly boys' toys. [At present the only role
of conventional forces in Europe has been to yield to American
blackmail, to join in Washington's neo-imperial out-of-area wars, mostly
against Islam.]{.underline} Trump used to be against these. Defence
planning famously fights the last war but one. Britain's navy is still
fighting the Battle of Jutland and its airforce the Battle of Britain.
The money wasted on useless procurement is stupefying. The United
Kingdom is perfectly safe from any existential attack: there is no
evidence of a Russian design to occupy Britain. Britain needs a decent
coastguard, better border security and first-class counter-terrorism. It
needs to guard its cyberspace. But its soft power is considerable and
its diplomacy respected. When Britain is over its Brexit crisis, defence
relations with Europe will need an overhaul. As a first step, it should
start thinking the unthinkable about Nato. For that, thank you Trump.

#### NATO causes a moral hazard and deterrence fails -- best for the US to leave 

**Whiton 2018** - Senior Fellow @ the Center for the National Interest\
Christian, \"NATO Is Obsolete,\" Jul 6,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/nato-obsolete-25167?page=0%2C1

After the alliance was established in 1949, its first secretary general,
Lord Hastings Ismay, summed up its purpose concisely: "to keep the
Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down." The unofficial
mission matched the time well: Western Europe's postwar future was
clouded by the prospect of a Soviet invasion, American insularity, or
German militarism---all possible given the preceding decades of history.
Nearly seventy years later, none of these concerns still exist.
Furthermore, NATO\'s opposing alliance during the Cold War, the Warsaw
Pact, quit the Soviet Bloc in 1989, and the Soviet Union itself passed
into history in 1991---twenty-seven years ago. Despite endless searches
for a new mission to justify its massive burden on U.S. taxpayers,
[[NATO has failed to be of much use]{.underline}]{.mark} since then. As
its boosters like to remind us, after 9/11, the alliance invoked its
Article 5 mutual-defense provision on our behalf. But action from
America's allies did not follow the grandiose gesture---the NATO mission
in Afghanistan relied mostly on U.S. forces and effectively failed.
Today[, [the alliance's bureaucrats]{.mark} and some member states
[spotlight a threat from Russia as a reason for keeping the organization
alive]{.mark}]{.underline}, along with a laundry list of "train and
equip" missions. [[Yet NATO members\' defense budgets don\'t reflect a
real sense of danger from Russia]{.mark} or anyone else]{.underline}.
Among the twenty-nine members, only [the United States is really serious
about its Article 3 obligations to defend itself, spending approximately
\$700 billion or 3.5 percent of its GDP on defense]{.underline}. No
other NATO member comes close to this proportion, and the vast majority
fail even to meet the modest, self-imposed requirement to devote at
least 2 percent of GDP to defense. Britain and Poland are rare members
that meet the 2 percent requirement. One of the worst free-riders is
Canada, which spends just 1 percent of its GDP on security, amounting to
\$20 billion. Furthermore, Germany spends a similarly pathetic 1.2
percent. Compare that to non-NATO members facing real threats, some of
which spend 5-10 percent of their GDPs on defense. These include Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who must contend with Iran and
spend nearly a combined \$100 billion. Israel, which faces the same
enemy, adds \$15 billion to the equation. Despite protestations of
poverty at a time when their economies have never been larger, [[NATO
members are more than willing to rack up additional liabilities, knowing
America has their back]{.underline}]{.mark}. Last year, the alliance
welcomed Montenegro. [It is now poised to admit]{.underline} the Former
Yugoslav Republic of [Macedonia, which would mean the United States is
pledged to defend a nation that devotes just \$120 million per year to
its own defense,]{.underline} not quite as much as the Cincinnati Police
Department. But the reality is [[there is no truly capable Russian foe
seriously threatening the West]{.mark}. Russia has one million uniformed
personnel in its military]{.underline}, the world's second-largest
behind America, but the European Union could easily afford to match that
with its combined \$17 trillion economy---ten times larger than
Russia's. However, it needn't bother as Moscow spends just \$61 billion
on its overwrought military, which doubles as an employment program.
Russia's Vladimir Putin has gotten the most from Russia's military,
occupying parts of Georgia and Ukraine and gaining influence in Syria by
backing the Assad regime. Still, his success in all three cases rested
heavily on surprises that Moscow seems unlikely to be able to repeat
against prepared and adequately funded European militaries. Yer we
should expect to hear none of this nuance at the NATO summit, as
poohbahs of the dying old European political order gather to tut-tut
President Trump in the alliance's fancy new \$1.4 billion headquarters,
funded predominantly by American taxpayers. To get out of this abusive
relationship[, [Trump should begin the process of limiting America\'s
role in NATO]{.underline}.]{.mark} A good model is that of Sweden, which
cooperates with NATO on some matters and not on others. Such an approach
could allow joint training, but end the practice of having over-burdened
U.S. taxpayers foot the bill for wealthy Europeans\' security. As part
of this plan, [Trump could mothball U.S. bases in Europe and shift most
resources spent there and in the Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific region,
where China and Iran pose real threats to America---and against which
NATO is irrelevant]{.underline}. [[Europe is prosperous and treats
America like a patsy. Let it stand on its own]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Entanglement

#### Members of NATO are susceptible to mutual entanglement -- results in incoherent and reckless military strategies

<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2022.2044315>)

[The Bosnian experience in the 1990s gave safe areas for civilian
protection a bad name]{.underline}. Several studies have highlighted
that from 1993 to 1995, [the Bosnian safe areas not only failed to
adequately protect civilian populations because of weak enforcement,
they also fuelled the ethnic conflict,]{.underline} becoming staging
grounds for high-risk military offensives by the supposedly protected
party.1 Strikingly, as I show in this article, this potential moral
hazard and related challenges were anticipated by United Nations (UN)
officials as well as in Western capitals. Nevertheless, [in]{.underline}
the spring of [1993]{.underline}, [the United States, Great Britain, and
France]{.underline} backed the safe areas policy at the UN Security
Council (UNSC) and [issued a much-publicised NATO airpower commitment to
'deter' attacks against the areas]{.underline}. [They did so
notwithstanding the **lack of a coherent strategy** to protect
threatened civilians -- let alone end the war]{.underline}. Given the
Western powers' avowed humanitarian instincts, [this policy choice not
only was **reckless** but also constitutes an analytical
puzzle]{.underline}. I argue that [the Western powers' decision to
support safe areas in Bosnia and commit military resources to this
ill-fated intervention policy constitutes a case of **mutual alliance
entanglement**]{.underline}. [Alliance entanglement occurs when a
state's decision to intervene militarily abroad is determined or
significantly influenced by its membership in an alliance]{.underline}.
That is, absent the alliance, either the state would prefer not to
become involved militarily at all, or it would choose a substantially
different intervention policy.2 To date, alliance entanglement has been
theorised as a one-way phenomenon. The idea is that one or several
allies are involved in a military conflict and pull other allies into
that same conflict. According to the classic argument, a state may end
up drawn into military conflicts involving its allies, to establish or
maintain its reputation as a credible security guarantor.3 More
generally, a state may allow itself to be pulled into military conflicts
by its allies because of 'the anticipation of future benefit from the
alliance' -- whether in the form of military security, burden sharing,
or enhanced diplomatic leverage in other contingencies.4 The possibility
that the United States and some of its main allies might pull each other
into conflicts besetting non-members, because of alliance pressures, has
not been explicitly examined. My argument is that [when alliance members
at first disagree openly about how to proceed in the face of a security
crisis]{.underline} in their neighbourhood, [after a period of
deadlock]{.underline}, [concerns about the alliance's perceived
relevance and effectiveness may **push** the **allies** **to coalesce
around an intervention policy that none of them previously
favoured**]{.underline}. [In such cases]{.underline}, [it is appropriate
to speak of **mutual entanglement**,]{.underline} given that the allies
pull each other into the resulting military operation. **[Mutual
entanglement]{.underline}**, I argue, [**is especially likely for
members of institutionalised alliances, such as NATO**, that combine
elements of both a traditional defensive alliance and a collective
security organisation]{.underline}. Members may value the alliance not
just for its mutual security guarantee, but as a symbol of their
collective identity, which can be expected to generate strong incentives
for consensual problem-solving.5

[Imagine a situation in which core NATO members]{.underline},
notwithstanding pressures to tackle a security crisis in their
neighbourhood, [fail for a considerable time to agree on a common
policy;]{.underline} indeed, they are at odds to such an extent that
they partly undermine each other. This results in significant alliance
discord and public recriminations. [Eventually, pro-alliance leaders on
different sides of the intra-NATO dispute]{.underline}, worried about
the alliance's health, [start pushing for a joint military
response]{.underline} -- [motivated to a significant degree by a desire
to reinvigorate the alliance and signal unity of purpose both
domestically and internationally]{.underline}. After some pulling and
hauling, [the main alliance members converge around a particular
military intervention policy.]{.underline} The alliance -- specifically,
the value that member states attach to the alliance relationship -- will
have pulled members toward the intervention. This is not a case of one
side in an alliance dragging other members into a military conflict.
Instead, [the allies have pulled each other toward intervention in a
non-member state; **they have mutually entangled each
other.**]{.underline} Using causal process tracing and drawing on
declassified US and UK documents, original interviews with senior
policymakers, and oral histories, I show that [mutual entanglement is
precisely what brought about the Western allies' military commitment to
the Bosnian safe areas]{.underline}.6 [The principal European
powers]{.underline}, on one side, [and the United States]{.underline},
on the other, [entered]{.underline} 1993 [with fundamentally different
policy preferences about Bosnia]{.underline}. [The Europeans favoured
impartial peacekeeping and supported a pragmatic settlement among
Bosnia's main ethnic groups]{.underline} (Bosnian Muslims, Croats, and
Serbs). By contrast, US president William J. [Clinton]{.underline} [came
to office]{.underline} in early 1993 clearly [identifying the Bosnian
Serbs as the aggressor and calling for aerial bombing of Serb
targets]{.underline}. [This resulted in near deadlock]{.underline} among
the allies and growing intra-alliance discord that spilled over into
public view. The safe areas policy was cobbled together later that year,
notwithstanding grave concerns about its effectiveness as a tool for
civilian protection, [in an effort to patch things up]{.underline} among
the allies and demonstrate to the world their unity of purpose. The
United States shelved its plans for broader airstrikes and military
assistance to the Bosnian Muslims; instead, t[he allies agreed to
support UN-proclaimed safe areas]{.underline} and issued a limited
airpower commitment to deter attacks on these areas. I argue that
**[without pressures related to the NATO alliance]{.underline}**, **[the
United States and Great Britain]{.underline}**, in particular, **[would
have been unlikely to support the safe areas politically and
militarily]{.underline}**.

#### NATO entangles the US in unnecessary conflicts -- each new member magnifies the risk of nuclear war

**Carpenter '22** (Ted Carpenter - Carpenter received his PhD in U.S.
diplomatic history from the University of Texas. He is the senior fellow
for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. "NATO
Security Dependents Are Not Useful Allies." The National Interest.
1/8/22.
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/nato-security-dependents-are-not-useful-allies-198953)

[TROUBLING PROMISCUITY about acquiring weak U.S. security partners was
evident even during the Cold War]{.underline}, and the tendency has
become even more pronounced in the post-Cold War era. As the fiasco in
Afghanistan (and its ugly predecessor in South Vietnam) confirmed, that
problem with U.S. foreign policy has existed in multiple regions.
However, [the defect has become most acute with respect to Washington's
campaign to expand NATO]{.underline} into Eastern Europe. Since the
mid-1990s, U.S. administrations have worked to add a menagerie of new
NATO members, and it has done so with even less selectivity and good
judgment than some people use to acquire Facebook friends. [Many of
those new members have very little to offer to the United States as
security partners]{.underline}. Indeed, [some are
mini-states]{.underline}, bordering on being micro-states. Such lightly
armed Lilliputians would add little or nothing to Washington's own
capabilities---especially in a showdown with another major power. [As
economic assets, their importance is decidedly limited, and militarily,
they are even less valuable. It's hard to see how new NATO allies such
as Albania, Slovenia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia enhance America's
power and security.]{.underline} That point should be apparent based on
size of population alone. Albania's 2.87 million, North Macedonia's 2.1
million, and Slovenia's 2.07 million people put those countries squarely
in the mini-state category, while Montenegro's 628,000 barely deserves
even that label. It doesn't get much better with respect to either
annual gross domestic product or size of military forces. Even
Slovenia's \$52.8 billion GDP puts that country only eighty-sixth in the
global rankings. Albania's \$15.2 billion (125th), North Macedonia's
\$12.26 billion (135th) and Montenegro's \$4.78 billion (159th) are even
less impressive. [The military forces that our new NATO allies can field
are not likely to strike fear into Russia or any other would-be
aggressor]{.underline}. Albania's armed forces consist of 8,500
active-duty personnel, Slovenia's consist of 8,500, and North Macedonia
has 9,000 available. Montenegro's active-duty force totals 2,400. In
comparison, the Austin, Texas, police department has 2,422 people in its
ranks. Granted, the Cold War edition of NATO also had some mini-states
as members, most notably Luxembourg and Iceland. However, those members
were located within a stable, democratic Western Europe. Their defense
also was geographically inseparable from Washington's mission of
protecting important military and economic players, such as West
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Great Britain, from what appeared to
be a totalitarian superpower with expansionist ambitions. That situation
was qualitatively different from Washington's gratuitous post-Cold War
decision to manage the security of quarrelsome mini-states in the
chronically volatile Balkans. [Since the mid-1990s, **the United States
has entangled itself** in the region's parochial spats, but giving some
of the countries **NATO membership intensified America's exposure to
needless risks and burdens**.]{.underline} [**THE RISK-BENEFIT
calculation is even worse** with respect to some of the other small
nations that have joined NATO in the post-Cold War era.]{.underline}
[**Those partners are not merely irrelevant** from the standpoint of
U.S. security;]{.underline} [**they are** potentially **dangerous
tripwires that could trigger a conflict between the United States and a
nuclear-armed Russia**.]{.underline}

#### Entanglement in the Baltics specifically aggresses Putin

**Carpenter '22** (Ted Carpenter - Carpenter received his PhD in U.S.
diplomatic history from the University of Texas. He is the senior fellow
for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. "NATO
Security Dependents Are Not Useful Allies." The National Interest.

https://nationalinterest.org/feature/nato-security-dependents-are-not-useful-allies-198953)

The United States is flirting with a similar danger today regarding its
small clients in Eastern Europe. President George W. [Bush's decision to
support the NATO membership bids of the three Baltic republics
was]{.underline}---and remains---[highly provocative to
Russia]{.underline}. One crucial way to reduce the danger of armed
clashes between great powers is to show mutual respect for respective
spheres of influence. [Washington has repeatedly violated that principle
by pushing NATO to expand right up to Russia's border.]{.underline} [The
addition of the Baltic republics in 2004 was the most dangerous
step]{.underline} in that process. As in the case of the subsequent
addition of the small Balkan nations to NATO, [the three Baltic
countries have **little to offer in terms of military
capabilities**.]{.underline} Estonia's 6,700 troops, Latvia's 5,500, and
even Lithuania's 20,500 wouldn't be much of a factor if war broke out
between NATO and Russia. However, [the drawbacks of making the Baltic
republics U.S. security dependents go far beyond their irrelevance as
military players.]{.underline} [Those three countries were once part of
both Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union, and substantial ethnic Russian
minorities still live in both Estonia and Latvia.]{.underline} The
Kremlin has complained on numerous occasions since the Baltic republics
became independent at the end of 1991 that the Russian population
suffers discrimination and other mistreatment. Indeed, that allegation
emerged long before Russian president Vladimir Putin became Russia's
leader. [**Relations** between the Kremlin and its former territories
**remain tense** because of that issue.]{.underline} Perhaps even more
troubling, [Washington's Baltic allies now are feuding with Moscow's
principal client in the region, Belarus.]{.underline} In the summer and
autumn of 2021, Latvia and Lithuania (along with the European Union)
accused Belarus of trying to use a flood of Middle East refugees as a
form of "hybrid warfare." The Lithuanian government even told its border
guards to use force if necessary to prevent the continued entry of the
migrants. A short time later, Latvia imposed a state of emergency to
deal with the same issue. A few weeks earlier, Lithuania had augmented
its border barrier by erecting a fence with razor wire. Latvia soon
followed suit. A new round of large-scale, Russia-Belarus military
exercises (held every four years) in September made tensions even more
acute. By virtue of both size and location, [the Baltic republics are
not credible strategic assets for the United States.]{.underline}
Indeed, [**they would be virtually helpless** if Russia made a military
move against them.]{.underline} A 2016 RAND Corporation study concluded
that a Russian offensive would overrun their defenses in approximately
three days. Such countries are not U.S. "allies" in any meaningful
sense; they are vulnerable dependents that could trigger a war between
NATO (primarily the United States) and Russia. [Washington's
patron-client **relationship with the Baltic republics is
risky**]{.underline}, and U.S. leaders were unwise to push for their
inclusion in NATO. However, beginning with George W. Bush's
administration, officials have engaged in even more reckless conduct
regarding possible alliance membership for two other countries, Georgia
and Ukraine. They have done so despite repeated warnings from the
Kremlin that making either country (especially Ukraine) a NATO member
would cross a red line that Moscow cannot tolerate.

#### Entanglement gives Putin a justification to escalate the war

**Toosi '22** (Nahal Toosi - POLITICO\'s senior correspondent for
foreign affairs and national security. "White House sweats over its
growing entanglement in Ukraine." Politico. 3/9/22.

Much of what Putin or his aides have said in recent days "is posturing
to try to keep countries from being more actively engaged, especially
countries geographically closer to Russia," the senior administration
official added. That's likely the case for a country like Poland.
Poland's desire to hand the jets to the U.S. suggested that it is
worried about how Russia would respond were it to give the planes to
Ukraine directly, said Scott Anderson, a former State Department
attorney who specializes in national security. [Russia is unlikely to
attack Poland]{.underline} --- it is, after all, a member of NATO, and
an attack would trigger a response from all of NATO, including the U.S.
[But Russia could use other means to retaliate, including economic
measures or cyberattacks, Anderson said]{.underline}. [The idea of
giving Ukraine the jets could be argued by the U.S. or its allies as not
being much different than giving Kyiv additional weapons, some analysts
said, even though fighter jets are more likely to capture the popular
imagination.]{.underline} But the mode of transfer can matter. [If the
Ukrainians fly the jets into their country from a Polish or American
base and clash with Russian forces along the way, that could **escalate
the crisis**,]{.underline} as Kirby suggested. [Russia may even have
some **right to argue** that Poland or the U.S. --- or Germany, perhaps,
since that's where one base under discussion is located --- has directly
participated in the war by offering a staging ground for the
jets.]{.underline}

#### Even if NATO does not directly respond to escalation from Putin with nuclear war, triumphant Putinism spurs nuclear aggression from China, North Korea, and Iran that would draw NATO in

**Rosen '22** (Stephen Peter Rosen is the Beton Michael Kaneb Professor
of National Security and Military Affairs at Harvard University. "If
Putin Were to Use Nuclear Weapons, What Would Follow?" The BullWark.

https://www.thebulwark.com/if-putin-were-to-use-nuclear-weapons-what-would-follow/)

Yesterday, Kremlin and White House officials answered questions about
[what might happen if Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine goes
nuclear.]{.underline} When asked by CNN's Christiane Amanpour about the
conditions under which Putin would order the use of nuclear weapons,
Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov replied, "if it is an existential threat
for our country, then it can be." This quickly led to speculation about
whether Putin might consider a threat to the continuation of his regime
as sufficiently "existential" to warrant the use of nuclear weapons. In
White House press briefing room yesterday, a reporter asked National
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan whether President Joe Biden would discuss
with other NATO leaders the possible use by Russia of nuclear weapons.
"Well, President [Putin]{.underline}, in the early days of the conflict,
actually [raised the specter of the potential use of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}," Sullivan replied. "We are constantly monitoring
for that potential contingency. And of course, we take it as seriously
as one could possibly take it." Biden likely would be discussing
"potential responses" with NATO leaders, Sullivan said. So far,
President Biden has chosen to proceed calmly. On March 11, he warned
that "[Russia would pay a severe price" if chemical weapons were used in
Ukraine but remained silent about nuclear weapons]{.underline} (although
senior administration spokesmen acknowledged that possible Russian
nuclear use was being closely watched). Any military preparations, if
there are any, were not announced. The strategy was to ignore the
nuclear threat as if it had not been made. This may have been the wisest
course, but it may have had the effect of further convincing Putin that
he has to do something that cannot be ignored. This week, Biden
intensified his rhetoric, saying that Putin's "back is against the wall"
and that Russian propaganda about Ukraine supposedly having biological
and chemical weapons is "a clear sign he is considering using both of
those." He reiterated the unspecific threat of "severe consequences."
Earlier this month I wrote in The Bulwark that [as the war goes worse
for Putin his incentives for using nuclear weapons go up]{.underline}.
Well, the war is going worse for him. [If Putin were to use chemical
weapons, he would test NATO resolve.]{.underline} NATO may be able to
deter Russian nuclear weapons use by mounting a fierce and violent
response to Russian chemical weapons use. It should prepare to do so.
[What if NATO responds with more sanctions but not military
intervention, and Putin raises the stakes again?]{.underline} Some
commentators appear to assume that [NATO at that point would have to
back down,]{.underline} however tragic that might be, [to avoid a
nuclear war]{.underline}. It may be the case that any NATO action that
could increase the risk of nuclear war is unacceptable. That is what
Putin is counting on[. A small risk of a nuclear war that kills millions
may well be unacceptable to us and our allies.]{.underline} We may
decide it is, but [we should do so with an understanding of what will
follow.]{.underline} [Putin and Putinism will be understood to be
victorious]{.underline}. [If one nuclear-armed nation can commit clear
acts of international aggression against a non-nuclear nation and then
shut down military responses by using nuclear weapons in a limited
manner, other nations with aggression in mind will surely take
note]{.underline}. [**Chinese nuclear coercion** would become part of
any plan against Taiwan]{.underline}. [**North Korean nuclear coercion**
would be revived. If Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons, **Iranian
nuclear coercion** of Saudi Arabia, though not of Israel, would become a
real possibility]{.underline}. [**NATO would need to deploy nuclear
weapons to the Baltic states** to defend them.]{.underline} Former
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for the deployment of U.S.
nuclear weapons to Japan after the invasion of Ukraine. After a Russian
victory, the Japanese government might ask for such deployments. In
which case, China would be furious. Other countries on the fence about
getting their own nuclear weapons will decide that they must. The point
is that taking action against Putin even though he uses nuclear weapons
has risks, but not taking action also has risks. They are just a little
bit further down the road.

#### Nuclear war would be catastrophic and collapse human civilization

**Lynas '22** (Mark Lynas - He has written for numerous publications,
including the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street
Journal, the Guardian and CNN.com. "What the science says: Could humans
survive a nuclear war between NATO and Russia?." Alliance for Science.
3/10/22.
https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2022/03/what-the-science-says-could-humans-survive-a-nuclear-war-between-nato-and-russia/)

Russian leader Vladimir [Putin has suggested that he would consider
using nuclear weapons if confronted with a NATO military response in
Ukraine,]{.underline} or if faced with a direct threat to his person or
regime. If the war spreads to a NATO country like Estonia or Poland a
direct US-Russia confrontation would take place, with a clear danger of
runaway nuclear escalation. The world is therefore arguably now closer
to nuclear conflict than at any time since the 1962 Cuban Missile
Crisis. [So what would a full-scale nuclear exchange look like in
reality]{.underline}? Is it truly global Armageddon, or would it be
survivable for some people and places? Many scientists have investigated
this question already. Their work is surprisingly little known, likely
because in peacetime no one wants to think the unthinkable. But we are
no longer in peacetime and the shadows of multiple mushroom clouds are
looming once again over our planet. Current nuclear weapons inventories
[The latest assessment of Russian nuclear military capability estimates
that as of early 2022 Russia has a stockpile of approximately 4,477
nuclear warheads]{.underline} --- nearly 6,000 if "retired" warheads are
included. [The US maintains a similar inventory]{.underline} of 5,500
warheads, with 3,800 of those rapidly deployable. The explosive power of
these weapons is difficult to comprehend. It has been estimated that
about 3 million tons (megatons or Mt) of TNT equivalent were detonated
in World War II. For comparison, each of the UK's Trident submarines
carries 4 megatons of TNT equivalent on 40 nuclear warheads, meaning
each submarine can cause more explosive destruction than took place
during the entirety of World War II. Hiroshima and Nagasaki In 1945 the
US attacked the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic
bombs, giving us two real-world examples of the effects of nuclear
weapons on human populations. A total of 140,000 people in Hiroshima and
73,000 in Nagasaki died instantaneously or within five months due to the
nuclear blast, intense radiant heat from the fireball and ionizing
radiation. Many people caught within 1km of ground zero were carbonized
by heat rays, and those up to 1.5km away suffered flash burning with
large areas of skin later peeling off. Some, especially those inside
buildings, were reduced to white bones as all flesh was vaporized by the
intense heat. Many survivors, later to become known as hibakusha in
Japanese, suffered acute radiation sickness (ARS) from neutron and gamma
rays released by nuclear fission in the blasts. Symptoms included bloody
diarrhea, hair loss, fever and intense thirst. Many later died. As well
as direct radiation from the fireballs they were also exposed to
radioactive fallout from the bomb. The longer-term effects of radiation
experienced by the hibakusha have been intensively studied, and include
increased levels of leukemia and solid cancers. However, experiencing an
atomic bombing was not an automatic death sentence: among the 100,000 or
so survivors the excess rates of cancer over the subsequent years were
about 850, and leukemia less than 100. [Hiroshima and Nagasaki show that
--- apart from short-term ARS --- long-term radiation from fallout will
be the least of our problems following a nuclear war. Much more serious
will be social collapse, famine and the breakdown of much of the
planetary biosphere.]{.underline} 'Limited' nuclear conflict -- 100
warheads between India and Pakistan Prior to the Ukraine war it seemed
very unlikely that the superpowers would confront each other again, so
many researchers turned to studying the impacts of more limited nuclear
conflicts. One study published two years ago looked at the likely
impacts of a nuclear exchange of about 100 Hiroshima-sized detonations
(15 kt yield each) on the most-populated urban areas of India and
Pakistan. Each detonation was estimated to incinerate an area of 13
square km, with this scenario generating about 5 Tg (teragrams) of soot
as smoke from wildfires and burning buildings entered the atmosphere.
[Direct human deaths in this "limited" nuclear war scenario]{.underline}
are not quantified in the study, but [would presumably number in the
tens to hundreds of millions]{.underline}. **[The planetary impacts are
also severe:]{.underline}** as the soot reaches the stratosphere it
circulates globally, [blocking incoming solar radiation and dropping the
Earth's surface temperature by 1.8C in the first five
years]{.underline}. This would be a greater cooling than caused by any
recent volcanic eruption, and more than any climate perturbation for at
least the last 1,000 years. Rainfall patterns are drastically altered,
and total precipitation declines by about 8 percent. (These results come
from widely-used climate models of the same types used to project
long-term impacts of greenhouse gas emissions.) [Food exports collapse
as stocks are depleted within a single year, and by year four a total of
1.3 billion people face a loss of about a fifth of their current food
supply]{.underline}. The researchers conclude that "a regional conflict
using \<1 percent of the worldwide nuclear arsenal could have adverse
consequences for global food security unmatched in modern history." A
2014 study of the same scenario (of a 100-weapon nuclear exchange
between India and Pakistan) found that the soot penetrating the
stratosphere would cause severe damage to the Earth's ozone layer,
increasing UV penetration by 30-80 percent over the mid-latitudes. This
would cause "widespread damage to human health, agriculture, and
terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems," the researchers wrote. "[The
combined cooling and enhanced UV would put significant pressures on
global food supplies and could trigger a **global nuclear
famine**]{.underline}." If global nuclear famine could result from just
100 nuclear detonations, what might be the result of a fuller exchange
of the several thousand warheads held in current inventories by the US
and Russia? [One 2008 study looked at a Russia-US nuclear war
scenario]{.underline}, where Russia would target 2,200 weapons on
Western countries and the US would target 1,100 weapons each on China
and Russia. In total, therefore, 4,400 warheads detonate, equivalent to
roughly half the current inventories held each by Russia and the US.
Nuclear weapons held by other states were not used in this scenario,
which has a 440-Mt explosive yield, equivalent to about 150 times all
the bombs detonated in World War II. This full-scale nuclear war was
estimated to cause 770 million direct deaths and generate 180 Tg of soot
from burning cities and forests. [In the US]{.underline}, about half the
population would be within 5km of a ground zero, and [a fifth of the
country's citizens would be killed outright.]{.underline} A subsequent
study, published in 2019, looked at a comparable but slightly lower 150
Tg atmospheric soot injection following an equivalent scale nuclear war.
[The devastation causes so much smoke that only 30-40 percent of
sunlight reaches the Earth's surface for the subsequent six months. A
**massive drop in temperature** follows,]{.underline} with the weather
staying below freezing throughout the subsequent Northern Hemisphere
summer. In Iowa, for example, the model shows temperatures staying below
0°C for 730 days straight. There is no growing season. This is a true
nuclear winter. Nor is it just a short blip. Temperatures still drop
below freezing in summer for several years thereafter, and global
precipitation falls by half by years three and four. It takes over a
decade for anything like climatic normality to return to the planet. [By
this time, **most of Earth's human population will be long
dead**]{.underline}. [The world's **food production would crash by more
than 90 percent, causing global famine** **that would kill billions by
starvation.**]{.underline} In most countries less than a quarter of the
population survives by the end of year two in this scenario. Global fish
stocks are decimated and the ozone layer collapses. The models are
eerily specific. In the 4,400 warhead/150 Tg soot nuclear war scenario,
averaged over the subsequent five years, China sees a reduction in food
calories of 97.2 percent, France by 97.5 percent, Russia by 99.7
percent, the UK by 99.5 percent and the US by 98.9 percent. In all these
countries, virtually everyone who survived the initial blasts would
subsequently starve. Human extinction? Even the 150 Tg soot nuclear war
scenario is orders of magnitude less than the amount of smoke and other
particulates put into the atmosphere by the asteroid that hit the Earth
at the end of the Cretaceous, 65 million years ago, killing the
dinosaurs and about two-thirds of species alive at the time. This
implies that some humans would survive, eventually to repopulate the
planet, and that a species-level extinction of Homo sapiens is unlikely
even after a full-scale nuclear war. [But the vast majority of the human
population would suffer extremely unpleasant deaths from burns,
radiation and starvation, and **human civilization would likely collapse
entirely**]{.underline}. Survivors would eke out a living on a
devastated, barren planet.

### EU Defense Integration

#### NATO prevents successful EU defense innovation -- creates an unrealistic model and promotes divisiveness

**Coffey '13** (Luke Coffey - Director, Douglas and Sarah Allison Center
for Foreign Policy. He received a master of science degree in the
politics and government of the European Union from the London School of
Economics. "EU Defense Integration: Undermining NATO, Transatlantic
Relations, and Europe's Security." The Heritage Foundation. 6/6/13.
https://www.heritage.org/europe/report/eu-defense-integration-undermining-nato-transatlantic-relations-and-europes-security)

The CSDP Is Duplicative and Discriminatory Toward NATO [Proponents of EU
defense integration argue that military capabilities developed under the
auspices of the CSDP will always be made available to NATO]{.underline}.
For example, an EU Battlegroup could also be on call for NATO operations
if, and when, NATO was ever to request the use of it. [This may sound
good in theory but is unlikely to work in practice]{.underline}. [This
is due to the institutional workings of the EU and the composition of
its membership]{.underline}. [Any time that EU military assets are used,
unanimous agreement by all EU members is required. Six veto-wielding EU
members are not members of NATO.]{.underline} Of these six countries,
five are established neutral countries: Ireland, Austria, Malta, Sweden,
and Finland. The other, Cyprus, is politically hostile toward NATO
member Turkey and has a track record of blocking NATO-EU cooperation in
the past. [The most recent example of EU duplication of NATO
capabilities is the **push for the creation of a permanent EU
operational headquarters**]{.underline} (OHQ). [An EU OHQ is a
**needless and expensive proposal** that is more about planting the EU
flag than it is about increasing Europe's military
capability]{.underline}. The EU already has access to the full range of
NATO's military headquarters at SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied
Powers Europe) under the Berlin-Plus arrangement.\[37\] Furthermore, the
EU has access to five national headquarters for use for EU-led military
missions.\[38\] The estimated cost of establishing an EU military
operational headquarters is tens of millions of dollars. At a time when
NATO is decreasing the number of its regional headquarters to save
money, it hardly makes sense for the EU to be increasing its own
numbers. Although a number of EU countries have called for the creation
of the OHQ, the British have so far been successful in blocking it.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague told reporters in July 2011 that
I have made very clear that the United Kingdom will not agree to such a
permanent OHQ. We will not agree to it now, we will not agree to it in
the future. That is a red line for us. We are opposed to this idea
because we think it duplicates NATO structures and permanently
disassociates EU planning from NATO planning. \[39\] [The CSDP is also
**discriminatory against non-EU NATO members**]{.underline}. [Perhaps
the best example is with Turkey. Although Turkey can be a challenging
partner for the U.S. and NATO, it is a valuable partner
nevertheless.]{.underline} Turkey played a key role in NATO during the
Cold War by being one of two NATO members that bordered the Soviet
Union. Turkey's military contribution to international security
operations sets it apart from many of the nations of Western Europe. The
Turks have deployed thousands of troops to Afghanistan. In addition,
they have commanded the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)
twice since 2002. The Turks have also contributed to a number of
peacekeeping missions in the Balkans, and participated in the
American-led Combined Task Force-151 in the Gulf of Aden to help combat
piracy and terrorism in the region. The source of this discriminatory
attitude towards Turkey is the dispute between Cyprus and Turkey. In
addition, many in the EU no longer want to give Turkey what it was
promised in the late 1980s: eventual EU membership. This has created an
atmosphere of animosity and distrust between the EU and Turkey. [These
two points combined have caused serious problems for NATO and EU
relations:]{.underline} The technical agreement between NATO's KFOR
military-led mission in Kosovo and the EU's civilian Rule of Law mission
was delayed for years; The technical agreement between NATO's ISAF
military-led mission in Afghanistan and the EU's EUPOL civilian policing
mission still has not been finalized; and In 2002 and 2003, this dispute
led to the delayed takeover of NATO's Operation Amber Fox in the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) by the EU. Cyprus's unwillingness
to cooperate with Turkey has been blamed for putting lives at risk in
places like Afghanistan. In 2011, a report published by the House of
Lords on the EU's police training mission in Afghanistan stated: We
still believe that the lack of a formal cooperation agreement between
the NATO forces in Afghanistan and EUPOL on the security of EUPOL
personnel has increased the risk to the lives of EUPOL personnel,
including British citizens. This is unacceptable.... Only the Taliban
benefit from the lack of such an agreement. \[40\]

#### US defense spending in NATO deters European defense development -- no incentive to contribute

**NATO '22** ("Funding NATO." North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
4/1/22. https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm)

When the North Atlantic Council (NAC) -- NATO's top political
decision-making body --unanimously decides to engage in an operation or
mission, [**there is no obligation for each and every member to
contribute** unless it is an Article 5 collective defence
operation]{.underline}, in which case expectations are different. In all
cases, [NATO]{.underline} (as an organisation) [does not have its own
armed forces, so Allies commit troops and equipment]{.underline}.
[Contributions vary in form and scale]{.underline} from, for instance, a
few soldiers to thousands of troops, and from armoured vehicles, naval
vessels or helicopters to all forms of equipment or support, medical or
other. These contributions are offered by individual Allies and are
taken from their overall defence capability to form a combined Alliance
capability, with each covering the costs associated with their
deployments. In 2006, [NATO Defence Ministers agreed to commit a minimum
of 2% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to defence
spending]{.underline} to continue to ensure the Alliance's military
readiness. This guideline also serves as an indicator of a country's
political will to contribute to NATO's common defence efforts since the
defence capacity of each member has an impact on the overall perception
of the Alliance's credibility as a politico-military organisation. [The
combined wealth of the non-US Allies, measured in GDP, is almost equal
to that of the United States.]{.underline} However, [**non-US Allies**
together **spend less than half of what the United States spends on
defence**.]{.underline} **[This imbalance has been a
constant]{.underline}**, with variations, [throughout the history of the
Alliance and more so since the tragic events of 11 September
2001]{.underline}, after which the United States significantly increased
its defence spending. [The volume of **US defence expenditure**
**represents approximately two thirds of the defence spending** of the
Alliance as a whole]{.underline}. However, this is not the amount the
United States contributes to the operational running of NATO, which is
shared with all Allies according to the principle of common funding.
Moreover, [US defence spending also covers commitments outside the
Euro-Atlantic area]{.underline}. It should be noted, nonetheless, that
[the Alliance relies on the United States for the provision of some
essential capabilities,]{.underline} regarding for instance,
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; air-to-air refuelling;
ballistic missile defence; and airborne electronic warfare.

#### NATO operates against European interests -- prevents independence and defense integration

**Shuo '22** (Wang Shuo - The author is a professor at the School of
International Relations of Beijing Foreign Studies University. "Only a
united Europe can break NATO's control, gain autonomy." Global Times.
4/5/22. https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202204/1257566.shtml)

Monday marked the 73rd anniversary of the founding of NATO. This US-led
bloc\'s repeated eastward expansion squeezed Russia\'s strategic space,
which triggered Russia to launch a military operation toward Ukraine.
Europe has been then dragged into plight. In seven decades, what has
NATO brought to Europe? For Europe, [NATO has been a double-edged
sword.]{.underline} Since the Cold War, NATO has provided Europe with
security protection. But [it has]{.underline} also [created
problems]{.underline} for the continent, [such as a **decline of** its
**independence** **and** the **restriction of European
integration.**]{.underline} Europe hopes NATO can play the role of a
shield, while under the leadership of the US, [NATO actually acts as a
spear, an offensive tool for the US to maintain its regional and global
hegemony]{.underline}. **[NATO]{.underline}** wants to achieve its
security through eastward expansion, but it **[has made Europe
increasingly insecure]{.underline}**. And [many security problems
encountered by Europe were created by the US.]{.underline} For example,
the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict was actually provoked by Washington.
[Europe\'s decades-long reliance on NATO for security has also resulted
in a **decline in its member states\' defense
capabilities**]{.underline}. In exchange for US security protection,
[Europe has to compromise with the US on non-security
issues,]{.underline} such as coordinating with Washington in exploiting
NATO to interfere in the affairs of other countries or regions to
safeguard US hegemony. Against this backdrop, [many of their joint
operations within NATO go **against Europe\'s interests.**]{.underline}
Europe\'s dependence on NATO is like taking painkillers. If Europe does
not take such medicine, it will suffer from pains. But by taking
painkillers, Europe will suffer more from the reliance or addiction to
the medicine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday, \"When
the Europeans will sober up a little from the American bourbon, when
they will finally realize that we must together care about the fates of
our continent, of Europe, even Eurasia, then the time will come finally
to reassess our relations and to enter the state of dialogue,\"
according to Tass. Peskov\'s line sounds very rational. Europe\'s
mentality toward the US and NATO has always been contradictory.
Europe\'s interests and strategic demands are different from those of
Washington. If Europe blindly follows the US, it will not be in line
with Europe\'s interests. Furthermore, whether it is the financial
crisis or the Ukrainian crisis, it is the interest groups of the US that
benefit in the end, including capital giants, military-industrial
complexes and energy giants. Those suffering the loss have always been
Europeans, who have to face problems such as soaring prices. Within
Europe, there are two schools, one pro-Atlantic and the other advocating
strategic independence. Since US President Joe Biden took office, voices
calling for strategic independence have become weaker. But the
Russia-Ukraine crisis has made many Europeans realize that Biden is not
much different from his predecessor Donald Trump - the one that suffers
is Europe, as always. It is believed the crisis could awaken the
Europeans. They should hold no illusion about the US and have a sense of
urgency that security and peace are not granted but something they must
fight for. On March 21, [the European Council formally approved the
Strategic Compass, giving the EU an ambitious plan of action for
strengthening its security and defense policy by 2030]{.underline}. The
plan includes establishing a strong EU Rapid Deployment Capacity of up
to 5,000 troops for different types of crises. [This plan is
symbolic]{.underline}. Europe does not have enough ability to maintain
its own security. Different member states have different military
strengths. The ability of small- and medium-sized European countries in
terms of military, supply, intelligence and command is limited. But at
least, [this plan is positive since it shows Europe has started to
strive for independence and to seek peace and security with its own
strength]{.underline}, despite the long road ahead.

#### EU defense integration is key to deterring Russia -- it's try or die -- NATO deterrence failing now

**Braw '22** (Elisabeth Braw - a columnist at Foreign Policy and a
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. "To Deter Russia, Europe
Needs More Military Integration." *FP.* 2/9/22.
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/09/to-deter-russia-europe-needs-more-military-integration/)

If Russian leader Vladimir Putin backs down from the Ukrainian border
this time, European countries can thank their lucky star---Washington.
[**In their current setup, they are hardly able to deter Russia.**
That]{.underline}, of course, [is the]{.underline} reason Macron and
others argue that [**a "true** **European army" is
indispensable**.]{.underline} But as de Jong and his troops---and indeed
European politicians and other officers---know, [military integration
isn't easy]{.underline}. Europe's best efforts to date are otherwise the
never-deployed EU Battlegroups and the Eurocorps, which functions as the
EU Battlegroup headquarters. The Netherlands and Belgium form a joint
navy, whose vessels patrol various waters. That's no mean feat, but it's
hardly as complicated as having soldiers of two nationalities
permanently serving alongside one another. The integration hasn't been
perfect. Indeed, for its first deployment the 414 Tank Battalion had to
borrow equipment from other Dutch and German units, and the 1st Panzer
Division is likely to need another couple of years before it's fully
combat-ready with its own equipment. But when the 414th returns on its
next rotation, it will be commanded by a Dutch officer. What's more,
[the two allies are in the process of integrating the Dutch Army's two
other combat brigades into Germany's Bundeswehr]{.underline}. The Dutch
11th Airmobile Brigade has already been made part of the Bundeswehr's
Rapid Forces Division; like the fully integrated 43rd Mechanized, it's
even listed on the Rapid Forces' list of units. Pending approval by the
new governments in Berlin and The Hague, the Dutch Army's 13th Light
Brigade will also be integrated into the Bundeswehr: an army's whole
combat capability, integrated into another country's army.
[Logistically, it's a staggering achievement---and politically,
too,]{.underline} considering that a mere 82 years ago the Netherlands
was occupied by Nazi Germany. At the moment, the two armies are even
writing a joint Common Army Vision. "[The German and Dutch armies are
constantly in contact with each other to discuss further
cooperation]{.underline}, which they do through a formal entity called
Army Steering Group," a spokesman for the German Army told me. Such
integration requires enormous trust. "The Dutch-German integration is
quite unique; it is nearly without caveats and works very well," noted
Bart Groothuis, a Dutch defense expert and member of the European
Parliament for the Dutch center-right People's Party for Freedom and
Democracy. "But if there were to be a crisis in the Baltics, would we,
for example, have the logistics to resupply it? The answer is no. So why
are we then so happy about it?" To be sure, the 1st Panzer Division
won't be supplanting U.S. forces in Europe anytime soon: U.S. European
Command has more than 60,000 military and civilian personnel, not to
mention superb equipment stored in various European countries. And when
crises loom, Washington can send more. On Feb. 6, 1,700 members of the
82nd Airborne Division deployed to Poland from Fort Bragg. To have
reached the 1st Panzer Division's level of integration is, however, a
remarkable achievement for any two countries. [Building
trust]{.underline} (not to mention overcoming language barriers) [are
just one part of the challenge]{.underline}. "There also has to be the
military and political will to make it happen," de Jong noted. "If
politicians are only interested in a picture in a newspaper, the whole
thing will fall apart." Of course, the whole thing will equally fall
apart of the countries disagree on when it should be used. If Germany
had wanted to send the 414 Tank Battalion to Lithuania and the
Netherlands had refused, it would have been useless. The unit's
deployment, NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu told me, "is a strong display
of Germany's and the Netherlands' commitment and capabilities. At a time
of unprecedented security challenges, the ability of allies to act
together quickly and effectively remains essential." Thanks to the
Bundeswehr, [the Dutch Army has maximized its striking and rapid-forces
capabilities at minimal expense.]{.underline} The Bundeswehr has, of
course, gained new soldiers and officers. And both sides share equipment
that would otherwise have to be duplicated. Indeed, interoperability and
cultural hurdles notwithstanding, integrating one's armed forces with
those of a neighbor seems commonsense. [With such integration, Europe's
various armed forces could turn into a **mighty force, one capable of
looking after the continent and any deserving neighbors.** Imagine what
fully integrated European armed forces would be able to do now that
Russia is flexing its muscles]{.underline}. Finland and Sweden are, in
fact, working hard to combine, for example, defense planning and use of
airfields. But [integration has the most potential if it involves a
larger and a smaller country]{.underline}. Germany is, in fact, working
to replicate the 1st Panzer Division success. And perhaps Macron should
start small by having France team up with Belgium? Indeed, other
European armed services could simply visit the 1st Panzer Division to
find out what's involved. "The Dutch-German cooperation could
demonstrate to other European NATO member states how to establish
deployable multinational units," the German Army spokesman told me. "Our
allies could use the Dutch-German experiences to identify approaches
that they themselves could use. That would help European armed forces to
increasingly establish large joint units for the defense of Europe."
There must be massive interest in your unit, I told de Jong. "Yes," he
said, "but people never say, 'We'll do the same.'" Virtually no
countries are as close and similar as Germany and the Netherlands, but

#### Russian escalation would be catastrophic -- global nuclear coercion and NATO draw in 

\*Same card from Entanglement scenario -- different tag

**Rosen '22** (Stephen Peter Rosen is the Beton Michael Kaneb Professor
of National Security and Military Affairs at Harvard University. "If
Putin Were to Use Nuclear Weapons, What Would Follow?" The BullWark.
3/23/22.
https://www.thebulwark.com/if-putin-were-to-use-nuclear-weapons-what-would-follow/)

Yesterday, Kremlin and White House officials answered questions about
[what might happen if Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine goes
nuclear.]{.underline} When asked by CNN's Christiane Amanpour about the
conditions under which Putin would order the use of nuclear weapons,
Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov replied, "if it is an existential threat
for our country, then it can be." This quickly led to speculation about
whether Putin might consider a threat to the continuation of his regime
as sufficiently "existential" to warrant the use of nuclear weapons. In
White House press briefing room yesterday, a reporter asked National
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan whether President Joe Biden would discuss
with other NATO leaders the possible use by Russia of nuclear weapons.
"Well, President [Putin]{.underline}, in the early days of the conflict,
actually [raised the specter of the potential use of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}," Sullivan replied. "We are constantly monitoring
for that potential contingency. And of course, we take it as seriously
as one could possibly take it." Biden likely would be discussing
"potential responses" with NATO leaders, Sullivan said. So far,
President Biden has chosen to proceed calmly. On March 11, he warned
that "[Russia would pay a severe price" if chemical weapons were used in
Ukraine but remained silent about nuclear weapons]{.underline} (although
senior administration spokesmen acknowledged that possible Russian
nuclear use was being closely watched). Any military preparations, if
there are any, were not announced. The strategy was to ignore the
nuclear threat as if it had not been made. This may have been the wisest
course, but it may have had the effect of further convincing Putin that
he has to do something that cannot be ignored. This week, Biden
intensified his rhetoric, saying that Putin's "back is against the wall"
and that Russian propaganda about Ukraine supposedly having biological
and chemical weapons is "a clear sign he is considering using both of
those." He reiterated the unspecific threat of "severe consequences."
Earlier this month I wrote in The Bulwark that [as the war goes worse
for Putin his incentives for using nuclear weapons go up]{.underline}.
Well, the war is going worse for him. [If Putin were to use chemical
weapons, he would test NATO resolve.]{.underline} NATO may be able to
deter Russian nuclear weapons use by mounting a fierce and violent
response to Russian chemical weapons use. It should prepare to do so.
[What if NATO responds with more sanctions but not military
intervention, and Putin raises the stakes again?]{.underline} Some
commentators appear to assume that [NATO at that point would have to
back down,]{.underline} however tragic that might be, [to avoid a
nuclear war]{.underline}. It may be the case that any NATO action that
could increase the risk of nuclear war is unacceptable. That is what
Putin is counting on[. A small risk of a nuclear war that kills millions
may well be unacceptable to us and our allies.]{.underline} We may
decide it is, but [we should do so with an understanding of what will
follow.]{.underline} [Putin and Putinism will be understood to be
victorious]{.underline}. [If one nuclear-armed nation can commit clear
acts of international aggression against a non-nuclear nation and then
shut down military responses by using nuclear weapons in a limited
manner, other nations with aggression in mind will surely take
note]{.underline}. [**Chinese nuclear coercion** would become part of
any plan against Taiwan]{.underline}. [**North Korean nuclear coercion**
would be revived. If Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons, **Iranian
nuclear coercion** of Saudi Arabia, though not of Israel, would become a
real possibility]{.underline}. [**NATO would need to deploy nuclear
weapons to the Baltic states** to defend them.]{.underline} Former
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for the deployment of U.S.
nuclear weapons to Japan after the invasion of Ukraine. After a Russian
victory, the Japanese government might ask for such deployments. In
which case, China would be furious. Other countries on the fence about
getting their own nuclear weapons will decide that they must. The point
is that taking action against Putin even though he uses nuclear weapons
has risks, but not taking action also has risks. They are just a little
bit further down the road.

#### The EU needs to oversee post-war reconstruction -- NATO stands in the way

**Cox '22** (Robert Cox -- Studied at Cambridge University and the
College of Europe. He was appointed Head of the EC Mission in Turkey.

Mastering the Future: [We want to assume that Russia will lose this
war]{.underline}---albeit at what cost to all concerned? Whatever
happens, [the European Union will have to assume leadership in promoting
a wider new security order in Europe while repairing the war damage,
physical and political]{.underline}. A damaged Russia---if that is the
outcome of today's conflict---must not be left to sulk in its
fastnesses, waiting for a chance for revenge. **[Further NATO expansion
is not the answer.]{.underline}** [A reformulation of the Organisation
for Security and Cooperation & Security in Europe (OSCE) might offer a
framework for a buffer-zone of security, including Russia's western
military districts]{.underline}. [**The EU has no longer any excuse to
delegate its security to a reluctant Washington**,]{.underline} tired of
more involvement in Europe anyhow. **[Political and economic
reconstruction in the east is the EU's responsibility]{.underline}**.
[The EU did it with some success after 1990]{.underline}; the experience
gained and instruments (such as the Bank for European Reconstruction and
Development ---BERD) are still there. Talented young Russians, now
fleeing the country, and essential for its rehabilitation, must be
encouraged to return home. As will Ukrainian refugees. This is not to
exclude the US. EU and US officials are reportedly looking at erecting a
transatlantic dialogue on Russia aimed at "giving a more permanent
structure to the flurry of contacts that have taken place since the war
in Ukraine" (Financial Times, March 30, 2202).

### Ukraine/Russia War

#### NATO security cooperation prolongs the war in Ukraine

**Carpenter '22** (Ted Carpenter - Carpenter received his PhD in U.S.
diplomatic history from the University of Texas. He is the senior fellow
for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. "If We
Don't Want Nuclear War, Why Are We Pushing for One?" Cato Institute.
https://www.cato.org/commentary/we-dont-want-nuclear-war-why-are-we-pushing-one)

[The principal features of the U.S. and NATO response to Russia's
invasion of Ukraine are now readily apparent]{.underline}. [In addition
to the U.S.-led effort to orchestrate a campaign of global economic
warfare to isolate and punish Russia]{.underline}, [Washington and its
allies have adopted a policy of showering Kyiv with sophisticated
weapons to boost the effectiveness of the country's military
resistance.]{.underline} Proposals also keep surfacing to provide
Ukraine with more capable jet fighters. In addition to the weaponry,
[the United States and other NATO members are actively sharing military
intelligence with Ukraine.]{.underline} The first component of the
West's strategy has enjoyed only limited effectiveness, but the second
one has achieved considerable success. [Russia has discovered that its
"special military operation" in Ukraine has gone much slower and come at
a substantially greater cost]{.underline} in both materiel and lives
than the Kremlin anticipated. [This development has encouraged
optimistic hawks throughout the West to advocate an even more vigorous
military assistance program under the assumption that Ukraine actually
might be able to win the war]{.underline} against its much larger,
stronger neighbor. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R‑SC) contends that "a loss for
Putin is possible if the freedom‐​loving world goes all‐​in for victory."
Among other steps, in his view, "all‐​in means providing the Ukrainian
Armed Forces with additional lethal aid and capabilities." [It is a
**faulty** **and** potentially very **dangerous belief that could well
bring about a nuclear war**. Moscow's principal objectives in Ukraine
are straightforward and uncompromising: compelling Kyiv to relinquish
its ambitions to join NATO and instead embrace legally binding
neutrality, gaining Ukrainian recognition of Russia's sovereignty over
Crimea, and forcing Ukraine to accept the Russian supervised
"independence" of the secessionist Donbas republics]{.underline}. If
Russian President Vladimir Putin and other members of the country's
political and military elite conclude that the war in Ukraine is failing
and that Moscow will not achieve those objectives, the Kremlin's
response is likely to be very unpleasant for all concerned. A cornered
Putin administration would have a powerful incentive to escalate the
conflict by using tactical nuclear weapons against military and
political targets in Ukraine. A few Western officials, including CIA
Director William J. Burns, seem aware of the potential danger. In his
response to a question from former Senator Sam Nunn (D‑GA) on April 14,
Burns warned that "[potential desperation" to extract the semblance of a
victory in Ukraine could tempt Putin to order the use of a tactical or
low‐​yield nuclear weapon]{.underline}. Such weapons are much smaller
than the "city‐​buster," multi‐​megaton monsters that both superpowers
tested during the Cold War and still remain in the strategic arsenals of
the United States and Russia. Nevertheless, the destructive effects of
detonating even tactical or low‐​yield nuclear weapons would be sizable,
and the symbolic importance of crossing the nuclear threshold would be
monumental. [It is extremely **reckless to pursue measures that increase
the likelihood of such a scenario**]{.underline}. Yet the [policies that
the United States and other NATO governments are adopting]{.underline}
(frequently prodded by elements of foreign policy establishment and the
so‐​called mainstream news media) [create precisely that
danger]{.underline}. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia,
contends blithely that warnings from Putin about using nuclear weapons
in response to mounting Western military assistance to Kyiv should be
ignored. "The threat of escalation is cheap talk," McFaul states
confidently. "Putin is bluffing."

#### Article 5 risks widening the war in Ukraine 

**Giltner '22** (Benjamin Giltner - Benjamin Giltner is a Contributing
Fellow at Defense Priorities and a first-year graduate student at the
George H.W. Bush School of Government and Public Service. "Washington's
entanglement with allies makes the Ukraine war much more dangerous." The
Orange County Register. 4/6/22.
<https://www.ocregister.com/2022/04/06/washingtons-entanglement-with-allies-makes-the-ukraine-war-much-more-dangerous/>)

A debate has emerged about whether the U.S. should implement a "no-fly
zone" over the skies of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky
requested that the U.S. create this no-fly zone over Ukraine when he
addressed the U.S. Congress. As many already recognize, the U.S.
implementing such a no-fly zone has the potential to bring unfathomable
consequences. While this debate is extremely important, another
development needs further examination: entangling allies---especially
exemplified in Poland's offer to send fighter jets to Ukraine. At
essence, [Poland sought to send an expected offer of MiG-209 fighter
jets to Germany so that the U.S. could send them into
Ukraine]{.underline}. In an act of wisdom, [U.S. officials dismissed
this offer]{.underline}, citing that [it did not want to have NATO
directly involved in the war]{.underline}. Still, [what is to prevent
Poland, or another NATO member, from making a bolder decision in the war
in Ukraine?]{.underline} [What if the U.S. becomes unintentionally
entrapped in this war?]{.underline} After all, Carl von Clausewitz
asserted in his infamous book, On War, that war is based on chance and
uncertainty. We do not want to be caught on the wrong side of chance in
this war in Ukraine. The alarm bells of this war spreading can already
be heard ringing in the distance. Entangling alliances, or as Barry
Posen in his book, Restraint: A New Foundation for U.S. Grand Strategy,
defines as "reckless drivers," pose as the main catalyst to the
potential widening of this war. **[The main reckless drivers that are at
risk of widening the war in Ukraine are those in NATO]{.underline}**.
[Membership in this alliance comes with a collective security guarantee
--- known as Article 5.]{.underline} [Essentially, if one country is
attacked, all members will go to war. **Such a provision is especially
disturbing with the ongoing war in Ukraine.**]{.underline} For one,
[Russia has issued a warning to the U.S. that Russia would attack
American military equipment shipments sent into Ukraine]{.underline}. Of
course, this warning is indirectly extended to NATO members as well.
There is no guarantee that these NATO countries will be arm-in-arm with
every decision of the U.S. in the West's confrontation with Russia over
Ukraine. [Countries pursue their own perceived national
interests.]{.underline} [Should one of these NATO members decide to send
military supplies and equipment to Ukraine, it will risk putting a
target on its back]{.underline} for the Russians to attack these supply
lines. In fact, [our eastern NATO allies are already sending deadly
weapons to Ukraine to fight and annihilate Russian soldiers]{.underline}
--- [increasing the risk of Russia attacking one of these
members]{.underline}. The sinking of the Lusitania during World War I
comes to mind as a synonymous case of a country at war attacking its
rival's supply routes of military equipment. What's more, [the NATO
countries bordering Ukraine, such as Romania, Slovakia, and
Hungary,should be cause for concern for the U.S.]{.underline} **[Whether
the attack is intentional or unintentional,]{.underline}** [these
countries are at risk to Russian missiles and bombs.]{.underline}
Russian attacks on Ukraine have inched westward, one of them being upon
a base near the city of Lviv, close to Poland. [All that is needed for
NATO to go to war against Russia is a single missile, or bullet, to
cross over into one of these countries.]{.underline}

#### The US should leave NATO before being drawn further into the Russia-Ukraine conflict

President Joe [Biden]{.underline} repeatedly has said the United States
will not be sending troops to fight Russia in Ukraine, but [vowed that
the U.S. would defend its NATO allies.]{.underline} \"As I made crystal
clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with
the full force of American power,\" he reiterated in an address
Thursday. [The main goal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\'s
founding in 1949 was to foster mutual assistance in response to the
Soviet Union\'s expansion in Europe.]{.underline} A key component of the
treaty, [Article 5, covers \"collective defense]{.underline},\" which
means that an attack on one ally is considered an attack on all allies.
Amid the current crisis, [Article 5 could mandate a more direct response
from the U.S. and other treaty members if Russian aggression escalates
beyond Ukraine.]{.underline} NATO announced last week it launched its
response force, a deployment of about 40,000 troops to provide land, air
and naval assistance across the alliance. This is the first time the
force has been deployed for a \"deterrence and defence role,\" a NATO
spokesperson said. Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on
Foreign Relations and professor of international affairs at Georgetown
University, told ABC News [it is possible **Article 5 could be invoked**
while the U.S. and its allies are providing military aid to
Ukraine.]{.underline} "[Let\'s say that Russia succeeds in toppling the
government]{.underline}. And it then tries to occupy and pacify Ukraine.
Assuming that the U.S. and its allies attempt to get arms to a Ukrainian
resistance movement, there\'s a not insignificant risk that Russia might
try to interdict that flow. [And that whether by design or by accident,
an artillery shell or a missile or a bomb could land in Poland or
another NATO country,]{.underline}" Kupchan said. "And [then we\'re
looking at the prospect of an attack on NATO territory and the potential
trigger of the Article Five collective defense guarantee]{.underline},
[which then raises the prospect of potential military conflict between
NATO and Russia]{.underline}," Kupchan said. All participating countries
agree to the form of solidarity outlined in the article, making it a key
component of the alliance. [While Ukraine is not a member of NATO, it
borders Poland, Hungry, Slovakia and Romania]{.underline}, which are
members. Ukraine has been moving toward the West and away from Russia,
attempting to join both NATO and the European Union. Kupchan said its
geographical location could be strategic during this conflict. "In the
current moment, Ukraine\'s border with four NATO countries affords it
two important advantages," Kupchan said. "One is refugees are able to
seek asylum in NATO countries, and we\'re seeing hundreds of thousands
of Ukrainians head west. And the other is that now that Ukraine\'s
airspace is ... dominated by Russia, [the long border between Ukraine
and NATO affords an opportunity to continue to funnel weapons and other
sources of support to Ukraine]{.underline}.\"

### AT LIO

#### Integration, opportunities for authority, shared economic gains, and widespread accommodation make the current international order stable - it's not dependent on NATO

// nsp

Self-Reinforcing Characteristics of Liberal International Order The
United States has dominated [the]{.underline} post-war [international
order]{.underline}. It is an order built on asymmetries of power; it [is
hierarchical]{.underline}. But it is not an imperial system. [It is a
complex and multilayered political formation with liberal
characteristics--- openness and rules-based principles---that generate
incentives and opportunities for other states to join and operate within
it. Four characteristics reinforce]{.underline} and draw states into
[the order. **First**, it has integrative tendencies]{.underline}. Over
the last century [states with diverse characteristics have found
pathways into its "ecosystem" of rules and institutions. Germany and
Japan found roles and positions of authority]{.underline} in the
post-war order; [and]{.underline} after the cold war [many more
states---in Eastern Europe, Asia, and elsewhere---have joined its
economic and security partnerships.]{.underline} It is [the multilateral
logic]{.underline} of the order that [makes it relatively easy for
states to join and rise up]{.underline} within the order.
**[Second]{.underline}**, [the liberal order offers opportunities for
leadership]{.underline} and shared authority. [One state does not
"rule"]{.underline} the system. [The system is built around
institutions, and this provides opportunities for shifting and expanding
coalitions of states to share leadership. Formal institutions, such as
the IMF and World Bank, are led by]{.underline} boards of directors and
weighted [voting]{.underline}. Informal groups, such as [the G-7 and
G-20, are built on principles of collective governance.
**Third**]{.underline}, the actual [economic gains from participation
within the liberal order are widely shared]{.underline}. In colonial and
informal imperial systems, the gains from trade and investment are
disproportionately enjoyed by the lead state. [In the existing order,
the "profits of modernity" are distributed across the
system]{.underline}. Indeed, [China's great economic ascent was only
possible because the liberal international order rewarded its pursuit of
openness and trade-oriented growth]{.underline}. For the same reason,
[states in all regions of the world have made systematic efforts to
integrate]{.underline} into the system. **[Finally]{.underline}**, [the
liberal international order accommodates a diversity of models and
strategies of growth and development.]{.underline} In recent decades the
Anglo-American model of neoliberalism has been particularly salient. But
[the post-war system]{.underline} also [provides space for]{.underline}
other capitalist [models, such as those associated with European social
democracy and East Asian developmental statism.]{.underline} [The global
capitalist system]{.underline} might generate some pressures for
convergence, but it also [provides space for the coexistence of
alternative models]{.underline} and ideologies. [These aspects of the
liberal international order create incentives and opportunities for
states to integrate into its core economic and political
realms.]{.underline} The order allows states to share in its economic
spoils. [Its pluralistic character creates possibilities for states to
"]{.underline}work the system"---to [join in, negotiate, and maneuver in
ways that advance their interests. This, in turn, creates an order with
expanding constituencies that have a stake in its continuation. Compared
to imperial and colonial orders of the past, the existing order is easy
to join and hard to overturn.]{.underline}

[The reality of liberalism in the non-western world is strong evidence
for the resilience and integrity of the liberal international order,
even in the Age of Trump]{.underline}. [The greatest victory of the
liberal international order was to create new stakeholders for its own
survival outside of its original home]{.underline}. **[The liberal
inter-national order now has many pillars supporting it]{.underline}**.
Even if American power recedes or Eastern European democracy backslides,
[there are other centers of liberal power in the world. To dismiss
non-western democrats as victims of false consciousness is deterministic
and flippant---indeed, it is a form of cultural condescension and
"Orientalism," dismissive of the authentically Even if American power
recedes, there are other centers of liberal power in the

indigenous pathways to open societies and accountable governance that
have arisen in the non-western world. [The subject is important because
Trump has made a special point of criticizing democracy promotion, as
noted above]{.underline}. Trump's claim about the relationship between
liberalism and Western history, then, is central to his"America
First"doctrine. [Trump's disbelief in the relevance or plausibility of
democracy abroadgives rise to a narrow vision of American interests, one
in which the United States can and should prioritize its power and
influence without regard for the traditional concerns of its allies or
for its values and ideals]{.underline}. But if Trump is wrong about the
prospects for liberalism in the non-Western world, then [democracy
pro-motion can again become an important component of U.S. foreign
policy.]{.underline}

### AT US Heg 

#### Pursuit of US heg in NATO fuels the Ukraine conflict -- fuels mass evacuation, global economic instability, and provokes further escalation

**TeleSur '22** "The US Fuels the Ukrainian Conflict to Maintain its
Hegemony." TeleSur. 3/25/22.
https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/The-US-Fuels-the-Ukrainian-Conflict-to-Maintain-its-Hegemony-20220325-0005.html)

A month has passed since Russia launched its special military operation
in Ukraine. [The United States has not only failed to take practical
measures to de-escalate the situation, but continued to \"fan the
flames\" through weapon assistance and sanctions.]{.underline} [The root
cause of the outbreak of the conflict is the continuous eastward
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]{.underline}.
[**To maintain its hegemony**, the United States has never hesitated to
sacrifice the interests of other countries, including its European
allies, which has long caused dissatisfaction among all
parties]{.underline}. Russia\'s concern that NATO is expanding to its
borders has never been heeded by the U.S., \"which is only interested in
maintaining its hegemonic status in Europe, and which has been steadily
retreating from that collaborative policy which the West committed
itself to after the Cold War,\" William Jones, Washington bureau chief
of Executive Intelligence Review, said. [After the Soviet Union
disintegrated, the U.S. has kept squeezing Russia\'s development space
through the eastward expansion of NATO,]{.underline} [which not only did
not disappear with the Cold War but has increasingly gained strength to
become a military bloc that engages in bloc confrontation under the
leadership of the U.S.]{.underline} In recent years, NATO has also wooed
Ukraine to join, which eventually crossed Russia\'s strategic bottom
line. President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned NATO against
deploying its troops and weapons to Ukraine, saying this represents a
red line for Russia and would trigger a strong response. In December,
[Russia presented the United States and NATO with a set of proposals for
binding Western security guarantees. Since then, Russia has conducted
intensive dialogues with the United States, NATO and the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe on security issues, but no
substantial result came out of them.]{.underline} Analysts say the
United States is the real initiator of the Ukraine crisis. Till now when
Russia and Ukraine are deeply mired in the conflict, the United States
is still trying to reap economic and political benefits from this
crisis. [Shares of U.S. military companies have risen sharply
recently]{.underline}. Former Pentagon analyst Franklin Spinney said the
U.S. Military-Industrial-Congressional Complex stands to benefit from
the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as it ramps up defense spending
for what could be a protracted affair in Europe. [While Washington has
made huge bucks from its military industrial complex, it continues to
demonize Russia\'s security threat to Europe and discourage the
latter\'s pursuit of strategic autonomy so as to consolidate its
hegemony.]{.underline} MANY COUNTRIES SUFFERING CONSEQUENCES [European
countries are bound to bear the brunt of the Russia-Ukraine
conflict]{.underline}. On one hand, [a multitude of Ukrainian evacuees
were flocking]{.underline} to other parts of the continent, [with knotty
problems arising from the **mass evacuation**]{.underline}; on the other
hand, [the crisis has also dealt a significant blow to the international
trade of energy and agricultural products, **threatening the global
economic recovery.**]{.underline} Obviously, the whole international
community will have to pay for this conflict, which broke out owing to
Washington\'s inflaming tensions. According to data updated Wednesday by
the UN Refugee Agency, more than 3.67 million Ukrainian people have been
displaced. As the situation continues to worsen, the figure is estimated
to surpass 4 million. Filippo Grandi, head of the refugee agency,
[described the Ukraine conflict as \"the fastest growing refugee crisis
in Europe since World War II\" in a recent tweet.]{.underline} \"The
combined speed and scale of this movement is unprecedented in recent
memory,\" noted the agency\'s spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh. [The
inrush of Ukrainian evacuees of this magnitude may put a strain on the
countries accepting them and trigger political and economic
problems]{.underline}. In late February, Slovakia has declared a state
of emergency in connection with the mass influx of Ukranians.
[Meanwhile, the crises of energy and food security stemming from the
Ukraine conflict also gave Europe a headache]{.underline}. Europe, as a
major importer of Russian energy, has been feeling the repercussions of
Western sanctions on Russia, given the [skyrocketing energy
prices]{.underline} in the continent. As the grain supply from Ukraine,
widely known as the \"breadbasket of Europe,\" is cut in the short term,
and possibly in the long term if the hostilities drag on, [the military
conflict is expected to further **push up food prices.**]{.underline}
Earlier this month, Jean Pisani-Ferry, a senior fellow at the
Brussels-based economic think tank Bruegel, published a blog post
assessing the significant economic policy consequences of the Ukraine
conflict on the European Union. He estimated that the corresponding
short-term direct budgetary cost for the bloc and its members could
represent US\$193 billion, or about 1.25 percent of GDP in 2022.
Following a meeting of the International Monetary Fund Executive Board
in early March[, the organization cautioned against \"very serious\"
economic consequences of the Ukraine crisis]{.underline}. \"[Should the
conflict escalate]{.underline}, the economic damage would be all the
more devastating. The sanctions on [Russia will also have a substantial
impact on the global economy and financial markets, with significant
spillovers to other countries,]{.underline}\" it warned.

"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the
threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political
independence of any state..." According to the Charter, which American
post-war planners helped write, the use of force is illegal and
illegitimate unless at least one of two prerequisites are met: first,
that force is used in self-defense; second, that the UN Security Council
authorizes it. This prohibition against war is not some trivial
aspiration. [[**Non-intervention** is the **centerpiece** of
i]{.mark}nter**national [law]{.mark}** and [the U]{.mark}nited
[N]{.mark}ations [has]{.mark} [repeatedly sought to
**underline**]{.mark} **its significance**]{.underline}. In 1965, the
General Assembly declared "No state or group of states has the right to
intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the
internal or external affairs of any state." Again in 1970,
[it]{.underline} unanimously **[reaffirmed]{.underline}** [[the
illegality of "**armed intervention**]{.mark}]{.underline} and all other
forms of interference or attempted threats." In 1981, the General
Assembly further specified that the Charter's "principle of
non-intervention and non-interference" prohibited "any ... form of
intervention and interference, overt or covert, directed at another
State or group of States, or any act of military, political or economic
interference in the internal affairs of another State." [[The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} currently [engaged in]{.mark}
**active [military hostilities]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} at
least seven countries, namely [[**Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen,
Somalia, Libya**, and **Niger**]{.underline}]{.mark}. That tally doesn't
include [[**drone strikes** in **Pakistan**]{.mark}, **combat
operations** in **Kenya, Cameroon**, and **Central African Republic**,
or **other interventions** of unknown magnitude]{.underline}. The true
number might be closer to 14 countries. [The White House is also
**explicitly [threatening]{.mark} U.S. [military action]{.mark}** to
change the regime [in **Venezuela**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
against **[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline} for a host of spurious reasons.
[Not **one** of these cases meets the prerequisites for **legal military
intervention**]{.underline} (a plausible self-defense case can be made
for the war in Afghanistan, but it expired a long time ago). **[[No
other state]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the international system [[uses
force more than the U.S]{.mark}. has]{.underline}. Throughout the Cold
War, [the United States used military means to interfere in other
countries]{.underline} about [twice as often as]{.underline} did [the
Soviet Union]{.underline}. This doesn't include interventions below the
threshold of military action: from 1946 to 2000, [[Washington
**meddled** in **foreign elections**]{.mark} more than 80
times]{.underline} (compared to 36 by the Soviet Union or Russia over
the same period). [[Covert op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} to **[overthrow
democratic]{.mark}ally elected [governments]{.mark}**, as in **Iran,
Guatemala**, and **Chile**, were a **staple** of U.S.
conduct]{.underline} in this period, and according to the Rand
Corporation, "the number and scale of U.S. military interventions rose
rapidly in the aftermath of the Cold War." [The [Congress]{.mark}ional
Research Service [lists more than **200**]{.mark} **individual U.S.
[military interventions]{.mark}**]{.underline} from 1989 to 2018, [a
rate that **no other country** even comes **close** to matching. [It's
**hard for America** to act as the **guarantor** of a **rules-based
order** that it **consistently violates**]{.mark}]{.underline}. When
President [Obama condemned Russia's annexation of Crimea]{.underline} in
2014, saying international law prohibits redrawing territorial borders
"at the barrel of a gun," it was somewhat awkward: [The United States
did exact**ly th**at in the 1999 Kosovo war]{.underline}, which lacked
Security Council approval, and successive administrations have similarly
supported Israel as it annexes and occupies territory in violation of
international law. Secretary of State John Kerry castigated Russia's
territorial grab this way: "You just don't in the 21st century behave in
19th century fashion by invading another country on completely trumped
up pretext." As it happens, that's a rather apt description of the Bush
administration's brazenly illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003. Washington
often appeals to international law to justify military action against
despots who commit atrocities, as it did when it secured UN Security
Council approval in 2011 to bomb Libya. But even there, [when the
initial use of force was authorized, the Obama administration **rapidly
exceeded the mandate of the resolution** by pursuing what amounted to a
**regime-change strategy**]{.underline}. And [such appeals to
humanitarianism are highly selective: U.S. **[military power]{.mark}**
has also been used to [assist **Saudi**]{.mark} **Arabia**, one of
[the]{.mark} world's [most **regressive authoritarian
regime**]{.mark}**s**, [commit **war crimes**]{.mark} and keep an
**impoverished** and largely **defenseless population** [in
**Yemen**]{.mark} **under siege.**]{.underline} America's delinquency
isn't restricted to the use of force. Though 139 other countries have
done so, Washington has refused to sign on to the Rome Statute, which
established the International Criminal Court. And although the United
States has badgered China for violating the UN Convention on the Law of
the Sea, which defines maritime rights and responsibilities, the U.S.
refuses to ratify the treaty itself. For all the talk of China's unfair
trade practices, [the only country that receives more formal complaints
about **WTO violations** than China is the **United
States**]{.underline}---and China does a better job of complying once
complaints are made. The political establishment in Washington has
always accepted this unique role for the United States[. We're the
policeman of the world. We enforce the rules and therefore **assert the
right to violate them**]{.underline}, even as we (often violently) deny
others that same prerogative. Any claim to special privileges rests to
some extent on whether the international community sees it as
legitimate. [The problem is that **[America's]{.mark} increasing
[disregard for the rules]{.mark}** [has **undermined its legitimacy**
and that of the **order itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}: [More than **any
other single nation**, [**its actions** determine]{.mark} the **basis**

[the power of **i**]{.mark}**nternational [law]{.mark}** to constrain

officials lambaste Iran for backing the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad
despite his use of chemical weapons, Iranian officials frequently remind
the world that [the United States aided]{.underline} Saddam
**[Hussein]{.underline}** [while he deployed **chemical weapons** on a
**much larger scale.** Our hypocrisy has **always** been a **threat to
our legitimacy**]{.underline}, but in the past it was often managed with
careful rhetoric and diplomatic maneuvers designed to conceal the
discrepancy between our words and our deeds, to camouflage our

most important challenge for humanity to overcome is that of
**existential risks**]{.underline}. One way to look at the danger of an
existential risk is to quantify the level of global coordination needed
to deal with it. While best-shot risks, at one end of the spectrum only
require that a single nation, organization or even individual (i.e.,
superhero) has the means and the will to save everyone, weakest-link
risks, at the other end of the spectrum, are dangers that might require
literally every country to take appropriate action to prevent
catastrophe, with no room for failure.2 3 [We've always been at risk of
**natural disaster**, but [with **advances in**]{.mark} **our level of

governance will increasingly be judged not only by the extent to which
it prevents harm, but also by its demonstrated ability to improve human
wellbeing.5 Progress has let us set our sights higher as a species, both
for what we consider to be the right trajectory for humanity and for our
own conduct.6 Major advances in human wellbeing can be accomplished with
existing technology and modest improvements in global coordination.
[**[Effective global governance]{.mark}** is global governance that

\*this card is also in the NATO Withdrawl CP file -- slightly different

**Binnendijk '19** (Hans Binnendijk is a distinguished fellow at the
Atlantic Council. He previously served as senior director for defense
policy on the Clinton administration's National Security Council. "5
consequences of a life without NATO". March 19, 2019.
https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/03/19/5-consequences-of-a-life-without-nato/)

Most people retire by age 70. Next month, NATO turns 70. U.S. President
Donald Trump has now been joined by Barry Posen, a so-called realist
political scientist, in suggesting that it may be time for the alliance
to retire as well. To see if they are correct, [let's consider what
international life might be like without NATO.]{.underline} There would
be at least five set of consequences, all negative. **[The most
catastrophic impact]{.underline}** of NATO's retirement **[would be the
risk of Russian aggression and miscalculation]{.underline}**. Without a
clear commitment to defend allied territory backed up by an American
nuclear deterrent, President Vladimir [Putin will certainly see
opportunities to seize land he believes is Russian.]{.underline} [He has
already done this in Georgia and Ukraine.]{.underline} Had they not
joined NATO, the Baltic states would probably already be occupied by
Russian troops. Certainly Putin would also see an opportunity to seize
more of Ukraine without the "shadow" of NATO to protect it. History
teaches us that major wars start when aggressive leaders miscalculate.
German leader Adolf Hitler attacked Poland in 1939, believing that after
then-British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's Munich Agreement,
England would be unlikely to respond. North Korea attacked South Korea
in 1950 after the United States appeared to remove Seoul from its
defensive perimeter. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990,
believing the United States had signaled that it would not respond. In
each case, miscalculation led to larger conflict.
**[Secondly]{.underline}**, **[NATO's retirement would also decrease
American military reach]{.underline}**, [its political influence and its
economic advantage]{.underline}. [American bases throughout Europe not
only provide for the defense of Europe --- they bring the U.S. a
continent closer to trouble spots that threaten vital American
interests]{.underline}. Fighting the Islamic State group, clearly an
American interest, would have been markedly more difficult without
permanent U.S. bases in Europe and without the American-built coalition
that included every NATO nation. [Without NATO, the **mutual security
interests** that underpin both U.S. bases and coalition operations
**would be undermined**. This **extends to the economic
realm**]{.underline}. [U.S. annual trade]{.underline} in goods and
services with Europe exceeds \$1 trillion, [and]{.underline} U.S. total
[direct investment in Europe nears \$3 trillion]{.underline}. These
[economic ties enhance U.S. prosperity and provide American
jobs]{.underline}, [but they require the degree of security now provided
by NATO to endure. NATO's retirement would thirdly **exacerbate
divisions within Europe**]{.underline}. NATO's glue not only holds
European militaries together --- it provides the principal forum to
discuss and coordinate security issues. [The European Union is unlikely
to substitute for NATO in this respect because it has no military
structure, few capabilities and no superpower leadership to bring
divergent views together.]{.underline} Germany and France already seek a
plan B should NATO collapse, but without the United Kingdom in the
European Union, an all-European approach is likely to fail. [The added
insecurity of NATO's collapse would also **amplify current populist
movements** in Europe.]{.underline} The consequence could be
renationalization of European militaries, a system that brought conflict
to the 19th and early 20th centuries. [The fourth consequences of life
without NATO would be global]{.underline}. [American bilateral alliances
in Asia would each be shaken to their core]{.underline} should NATO
fail. America's defense commitments there would become worthless. [With
China determined to claim a dominant position in Asia, the collapse of
NATO would cause America's Asian partners to seek accommodation with
China,]{.underline} much as the Philippines is in the process of doing.
Trump's decision to abandon the economic Trans-Pacific Partnership
agreement has already given China new advantages in the region. Without
credible American security commitments, [there would be **little to stop
China from controlling the South China Sea** **and** probably occupying
**Taiwan** as well]{.underline}. [Add to this equation the new footholds
that China is building in central Asia, Africa and Europe:]{.underline}
[Abandoning NATO would help assure China's competitive success. The
final impact of NATO's retirement would be the near **collapse of** what
has been called the "**liberal international order."**]{.underline} This
order consists of treaties, alliances, agreements, institutions and
modes of behavior mostly created by the United States in an effort to
safeguard democracies. [This order has kept relative peace in the
trans-Atlantic space for seven decades]{.underline}. The Trump
administration has begun to unravel elements of this order in the naive
notion that they undercut American sovereignty. The entire European
project is built on the edifice of this order. NATO is its principal
keystone. Collapsing this edifice would undercut the multiple structures
that have brought seven decades of peace and prosperity. So the answer
is clear. **[Life without NATO would be more dangerous and less
prosperous]{.underline}**. **[Russia and China would be the big winners
at America's expense]{.underline}**. NATO simply can't retire. Yes, NATO
has problems. It needs to be managed. But there is too much left to be
done for retirement. And there is too much to lose if NATO fails.

#### The alternative is war

**Berlinski** 7-15-20**18** -- PhD in IR @ Oxford (Claire, "Europe's
Dependence on the U.S. Was All Part of the Plan: Postwar U.S. statesmen
designed our world order as it is for a reason. They had lived through
what happened without it.," *Politico*,
<https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/15/trump-nato-europe-history-dependence-219011>)

[Trump's NATO-bashing surprised no one]{.underline}. He has repeatedly
suggested the United States' postwar security architecture is a "bad
deal," one negotiated by weak and foolish "incompetents." [Foreign
policy, in his view, is a zero-sum game]{.underline}; any benefit to
another nation must of necessity be a loss for the United States. "NATO
countries," he declared on Twitter, "must pay MORE, the United States
must pay LESS. Very Unfair!" Unfair? A world that revolves around
American military, economic and cultural power, and uses the U.S. dollar
as its reserve currency? [What Trump fails to understand is
that]{.underline} the disparity in spending, with [the U.S. paying more
than its allies, is not a bug of the system. It **is a
feature**]{.underline}. [This is how]{.underline} the
[great]{.underline} postwar [states]{.underline}men [designed it, and
this immensely foresighted strategy has ensured the absence of great
power conflict]{.underline}---[and nuclear war]{.underline}---[for
three-quarters of a century]{.underline}. [The open, liberal world order
we know today]{.underline} was built in the wake of World War II and
expanded after the collapse of the Soviet Union. By design, it [is led
by the United States; by design, it ensures permanent U.S. military
hegemony over Eurasia while uniting Europe under the U.S.'
protection]{.underline}. The goal of this American grand strategy is to
prevent any single power from dominating the region and turning on the
United States and its allies. [American hegemony serves]{.underline},
too, [to quell previously intractable regional rivalries,
preventing]{.underline} further [world wars]{.underline}. Dean Acheson,
George Marshall and the other great statesmen of their generation
pursued this strategy because they had learned, at unimaginable cost,
that the eternal American fantasy of forever being free of
Europe---isolationism, or America Firstism, in other words---was just
that: a fantasy. Four hundred thousand American men lost their lives in
the European theaters of the First and Second World Wars. (American
fatalities in all of the other 20th-century conflicts---including
Vietnam, Korea and the Persian Gulf---do not total one-quarter of that
number.) Our postwar statesmen were neither weak nor incompetent. They
were the architects of the greatest foreign policy triumph in U.S.
history. [So successful was this policy that Americans
now]{.underline}---most of whom weren't alive to witness the enormity of
these wars---[see peace, unity, prosperity and stability as Europe's
natural state]{.underline}. **[This is an illusion]{.underline}**. For
centuries, Europe was the fulcrum of global violence. With the age of
global exploration, it became the globe's primary exporter of violence,
the tempo and horror of the carnage rising every century with
improvements in technology for violence. The Scramble for Africa, the
division and colonization of that continent by Europe, is a case in
point. The 1884-85 Berlin West Africa Conference, which assembled the
representatives of 13 European powers to settle their colonial claims to
Africa by diplomacy in place of arms, did lead to peace in Europe for
several years. Africans, however, would not recall these years for their
exceptional comity. For example, the conference indulged King Léopold
II's claim that the Congo Free State was his private property. Ten
million Congolese souls perished under his ministrations. In recognizing
this history of blood, however, we must recognize something equally
true: In the wake of World War II, liberal democracy saw its fullest
realization in the West. This flourishing of peace and human rights
cannot be explained by a sudden outbreak of European pacifism. (Consider
the 1956 Suez expedition, crushed by an infuriated President Dwight
Eisenhower; or the 1954-62 Franco-Algerian War.) It happened because
during World War II, Europe destroyed itself, leaving the United States
overwhelmingly powerful by comparison, its only rival the Soviet Union.
Through the application of economic, diplomatic and military force
majeure, the United States suppressed Europe's internal security
competition. This is why postwar Europe ceased to be the world's leading
exporter of violence and became, instead, the world's leading exporter
of luxury sedans. [Only America, and massive power as the U.S. exercised
it, could have pacified and unified Europe]{.underline} under its aegis.
No other continental country possessed half the world's GDP. No other
country had enough distance from Europe to be trusted, to a large
extent, by all parties and indifferent to its regional jealousies. No
other country had a strategic, moral and economic vision for Europe that
its inhabitants could be persuaded gladly to share. Indeed, Europeans
cooperated with the U.S. program because it created conditions under
which both the United States and Europe flourished. The United States
assisted Europe's postwar economic recovery with \$13 billion of aid in
the form of the Marshall Plan. (In today's dollars, roughly \$113
billion.) It midwifed the groupings and treaties that would become the
European Union. It brought Europe under the U.S. security umbrella with
the NATO treaty. Article V of the treaty, its most important element,
declares that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all
members. These policies were intended not only to counter the Soviet
Union, but to condition Europe's prosperity upon its integration into a
single market, with free movement of goods, capital and labor. The
founders of these institutions fully intended them to be the foundations
of a United States of Europe, much like the United States of America.
Profound economic interdependence, they believed, would make further
European wars impossible. At the same time, [the United States built an
open, global order upon an architecture of specific
institutions]{.underline}: the United Nations, the International
Monetary Fund and the International Court of Justice. [This order is in
many respects an empire]{.underline}---a Pax Americana---[but it is more
humane than any empire that preceded it]{.underline}, with institutions
that are intended to benefit all parties. Postwar U.S. statesmen
believed that prosperous, [liberal democracies that traded
freely]{.underline} with each other would [neither go to war with each
other nor the United States]{.underline}. They ascribed, in other words,
to the so-called Democratic Peace theory---a theory with overwhelming
empirical support. The U.S. military was always an integral part of the
plan to unite and rebuild Europe from the rubble. Since World War II,
U.S. troops have been deployed in Eurasia to ensure the continent cannot
be dominated by a single power capable of monopolizing its resources and
turning them against the U.S. The United States has built overwhelmingly
massive military assets there to deter local arms races before they
begin, and it has simultaneously assured those under U.S. protection
that there is no need to begin local arms races, for their safety is
guaranteed. American grand strategy rests upon the credibility of its
promise to protect American allies; this credibility rests, in turn,
upon U.S. willingness to display its commitment. (The Berlin Airlift,
when U.S. troops airlifted supplies to Berlin during a Soviet blockade,
was precisely such a display.) In return for the United States'
commitment, U.S. allies have accepted America's dominant role in the
international system. In the postwar era, just as now, the enemies of
liberal democracy sought to undermine the order the U.S. was building.
Precisely because the Marshall Plan would strengthen and unite the West
under the United States' protection, the Soviet Union's propaganda
organs cranked into overdrive to denounce it. A cartoon, for example,
published in Isvestia in 1949, depicted the Marshall Plan's
administrator, Paul Hoffman, as a fat capitalist bent on destroying the
sovereignty of European nations. The French paper L\'Humanité, which
reliably parroted Moscow's line, wrote, "After disorganizing the
national economies of the countries which are under the American yoke,
American leaders now intend conclusively to subjugate the economy of
these countries to their own interests." The Soviet Union's criticism of
the Marshall Plan and other American involvement in Europe was eerily
similar to the language Russia's now uses in its campaign to undermine
NATO and the EU. The vocabulary and tropes of Russian propaganda are
widely echoed, wittingly or unwittingly, by far-right, far-left and
other antiliberal politicians, parties and movements throughout the
West. With the men who built the postwar world order now in their
graves, and the memory of carnage and horror buried with them, a very
sizable constituency of Americans has forgotten that their country built
this system for a reason---that [the United States does not maintain its
alliances as an act of foolish largesse]{.underline}. The loudest
exponent of the idea that the U.S. is getting rolled, that the European
Union was "created to destroy us," and that multilateral institutions
such as the World Trade Organization assault the "sovereignty" of the
nations concerned is, unfortunately, the president of the United States.
It's hard to understate how foolish and reckless these notions are.
[History can be shoved down the memory hole, for a time, but reality is
never so cooperative]{.underline}. [Global free trade sustains modern
economic life. An interruption to this trade]{.underline}---carried out
chiefly on global shipping lanes safeguarded by the U.S.
military---[would bring modern life to an end]{.underline}. The Second
World War proved not only that isolationism and American-Firstism were
fantasies, but exceptionally childish and dangerous ones, at that. In
the age of hyperglobalized trade, international air travel, the
internet, nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, these
fantasies are even more childish and dangerous. The U.S. may be on
another continent, but it is not on another planet. It is true that the
U.S. spends more on its military, in absolute dollars and as a
percentage of GDP, than any European country. That was always part of
the deal. The U.S. is a global superpower. It can fight a war anywhere
in the world, invade any country at will, and (at least in theory) fight
multiple simultaneous major wars---even in space. Of course this costs
more. It is in America's advantage to be the only power on the planet
that can do this. Conversely, it is not remotely in America's advantage
for other countries to spend as much money on their militaries as we do.
Europe is America's biggest export market, as designed. We want
Europeans to spend their money enjoying U.S. goods and services, not
razing Flanders to the ground yet again. [Yet Trump's refusal
to]{.underline} deter our shared enemies and [protect our allies risks
provoking a regional European **arms race**]{.underline}---exactly what
the U.S. has sought to avoid for 74 years[. It is an invitation to
adventurism from Putin]{.underline}. Trump's refusal to adopt the
encouraging language of past presidents toward European integration,
language that until now has been transformed into policy by professional
and experienced State Department employees, puts further strain on an
already-weakened Europe. Above all, Trump's overt support for sordid,
Kremlin-backed actors who seek to undermine Europe's unity is
unfathomable: How could it be in Europe's interest, or in ours, for the
American president to lend the United States' prestige and support to
Europe's Nazis, neo-Nazis, doctrinal Marxists, populists,
authoritarians, and ethnic supremacists, particularly since all of them
are ideologically hostile to the United States? The damage
[Trump]{.underline} has deliberately inflicted on Europe's stability
[comes at a uniquely dangerous time]{.underline}. Democracy's so-called
third wave---the global blossoming of open political systems after the
Cold War---has long since receded. [A threat to liberal
democracy]{.underline}, in the form of a distinct, rival
ideology---illiberal democracy---[is ascendant]{.underline}. We see it
today in Russia and Turkey---a corrupt, oligarchic, kleptocratic and
hollow form of democracy that spreads and consolidates itself through
the new technologies of the 21st century. The global order the U.S.
built was based on the principle that [only a world of liberal
democracies can be peaceful and prosperous.]{.underline} That principle
is correct. [Should the unraveling of the order the U.S. built
proceed]{.underline} at this pace, [the world will soon be neither
peaceful nor prosperous]{.underline}. [Nor will the effects be confined
to regions distant from the United States. America will feel
them]{.underline} gradually, and then, probably, overnight---[in the
form of a devastating, sudden shock]{.underline}. Charles de Gaulle
believed the Anglophone world could not, in the long term, be trusted
with French security. It led him to withdraw France from NATO's military
integrated command and launch an independent nuclear development
program. The independent nuclear program was real, but the withdrawal
from NATO wasn't---a secret agreement kept France in NATO anyway. But,
today, with other NATO members obliged to consider the costs and
benefits of an independent accommodation with Russia and the risks and
rewards of acquiring an independent nuclear deterrent, de Gaulle is
saying from the grave, I told you so. [The American-led world
order]{.underline}, undergirded by the ideal of liberal democracy, has
been highly imperfect. But it [has been the closest thing to Utopia our
fallen and benighted species has ever seen. Its benefits are not just
economic, although those benefits are immense]{.underline}. [Its
benefits must be measured in wars not fought, lives not
squandered]{.underline}. [Yet]{.underline} many [Americans have turned
their backs]{.underline} on history and reality alike. [Let us hope
pride does not prevent them from realizing this mistake before it's far
too late]{.underline}.

#### NATO alliance is key to the economy and solve global security issues -- terrorism, climate change, and pandemics

None of this, of course, is likely to disturb [Mr. Trump, who remains
steadfast in his belief that]{.underline} whatever benefits the United
States gained from the trans-Atlantic alliance in the past, [the country
no longer profits. But he's wrong --- there are compelling reasons that
[NATO]{.mark} in particular [will be a distinct advantage for America's
security]{.mark} far into the future.]{.underline} First,
[[NATO's]{.mark} formidable conventional and nuclear [forces are the
most effective way to protect North America and
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} --- the heart of the democratic world ---
[[from attack]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Threats]{.mark} to our collective
security [have not vanished]{.mark} in the 21st century. Mr. [Putin
remains]{.mark} a determined adversary [preying on]{.mark} Eastern
[Europe and]{.mark} American [elections]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[NATO is
a]{.mark} force [multiplier]{.mark}: The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[has allies who will stand by us]{.mark}]{.underline}, while Russia has
none. And while it's true that most of America's NATO allies need to
increase their defense spending under the treaty, they're not
freeloaders: [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [relied on
NATO]{.mark} allies [to strike]{.mark} back [against Al Qaeda]{.mark} in
Afghanistan and the Islamic State [in the Middle
East]{.mark}.]{.underline} European troops have replaced American
soldiers in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and contribute the large
majority in Kosovo. Our NATO allies are also getting better about
contributing their fair share. They have increased their defense
spending by a total of more than \$87 billion since Mr. Putin annexed
Crimea in 2014. Fourteen more allies will reach NATO's military spending
target --- 2 percent of gross domestic product --- by 2024. Mr. Trump
would be smart to claim credit for this at this week's summit. [[A
second reason]{.mark} for maintaining the trans-Atlantic alliance
[is]{.mark} America's [economic future]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
European Union is our country's largest trade partner, and its largest
investor. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} the
[E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion [are the]{.mark} world's two [largest
economies]{.mark}, and can steer global trade to their advantage if they
stick together. More than [four million Americans work for European
companies in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. [Forty-five]{.mark} of
the 50 [states export more to Europe than to China]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Mr. Trump is right that the two sides are also economic competitors, and
trade disputes are inevitable. His predecessors kept this tension in
balance lest there be damaging consequences for American businesses,
workers and farmers --- a good reminder for Mr. Trump, whose
ill-conceived trade war with Canada and Europe risks harming the
American economy. Third, [[future]{.mark} American [leaders will
find]{.mark} [Europe is our most capable]{.mark} and willing [partner in
tackling]{.mark} the biggest [threats to]{.mark} global [security:
climate change; drug and cybercrime cartels; terrorism; pandemics and
mass migration from Africa and the Middle East.]{.mark}]{.underline} And
[America's NATO [allies will continue to be indispensable in]{.mark}
safeguarding [democracy]{.mark} and freedom, [under assault by Russia
and China]{.mark}.]{.underline} Mr. [Trump's campaign to undermine the
European Union and diminish America's leadership in NATO serves none of
these interests]{.underline}. He seems driven by resentment about
European trade surpluses and low defense budgets, issues that blind him
to all the other benefits Americans derive from our alliance with Europe
and Canada. Mr. Trump may believe his blistering attacks on Europe's
trade policies and defense budgets are a good negotiating tactic before
the summit. But in fact they have already done enormous damage. While
**[he cannot]{.underline}** [outright]{.underline} **[kill
NATO]{.underline}** [--- the American public and Congress support it too
strongly]{.underline} --- he has eroded significant levels of trust and
good will. As it became clear during my recent visits across Europe, a
dangerous breach has opened in the trans-Atlantic alliance --- by far
the worst in seven decades. [Mr. Trump wants Americans to believe that
their allies are simply taking advantage of them. [On Sept. 11]{.mark},
2001]{.underline}, I witnessed a far different reality as American
ambassador to NATO. [[Canada and the European allies volunteered within
hours of the attacks to invoke Article 5 of]{.mark} the
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} treaty, which compels all members to respond
to an attack on any single member, for the first time in history. [[They
came to our defense when we]{.mark} most [needed them]{.mark}. They sent
troops to fight with us in Afghanistan. They are still there with us 17
years later.]{.underline} Are we now going to throw off that mutual
protection, and go it alone in a dangerous 21st-century world? That
would be a historic mistake. But that is where we may find ourselves if
Mr. Trump's anti-Europe vendetta continues.

### LIO -- 1AR

**Extend Binnendijk '19**

#### NATO underpins the LIO -- increasing cooperative security is key to its survival

**Miller '18** (Paul Miller - Professor in the Practice of International
Affairs, Georgetown University, Nonresident Senior Fellow. "This is How
the Liberal International Order Dies." Atlantic Council. 6/12/18.
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/this-is-how-the-liberal-international-order-dies/)

Last year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, after meeting US
President Donald J. Trump at the NATO Summit in Brussels, "The times in
which we could completely depend on others are, to a certain extent,
over...We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands."
That she said it on Memorial Day weekend---the day the United States
honors veterans of World War II---seemed an especially sharp rebuke.
Worse than the rebuke was this: Merkel might not be wrong. Trump
threatened at this week's NATO Summit in Brussels to "do his own thing,"
if allies did not increase their defense spending. That comment came on
the heels of his administration having publicly floated the idea of
withdrawing US troops stationed in Germany, already at their lowest
level since they first crossed the Rhine in 1944. [The withdrawal of the
United States from NATO]{.underline}, or of US troops from Germany,
[would represent a tectonic shift in geopolitics unparalleled in the
postwar era]{.underline}. **[NATO is the signature pillar of the liberal
international order,]{.underline}** given teeth by the presence of US
troops on the European Continent. [As the collective security
organization of the world's most powerful liberal
democracies,]{.underline} [NATO embodied the free world's cooperative
effort to build and sustain a world that reflected its
values.]{.underline} Today, [the transatlantic alliance---and **the
liberal international order** it underpins---**is at its lowest
ebb**]{.underline} in its 69-year history. Some European policymakers
have publicly contemplated a European nuclear deterrent in lieu of the
US security guarantee. [The United States' closest allies in world's
most powerful and important strategic region **are moving toward
replacing cooperative security with rearmament and
proliferation**.]{.underline} **[This is how the liberal international
order dies.]{.underline}**

[Wilson\'s liberal legacy, however, was two-fold: the promotion of
liberal democracy and the creation of multilateral
institutions]{.underline}. **[Order rests on a relatively stable
distribution of power]{.underline}**, as realists like Mearsheimer
correctly describe, [but it also benefits from an institutional
framework that enhances cooperation to **manage security, economic, and
ecological interdependence**]{.underline}. [Alliances can enhance
stability, but security is also enhanced by the existence of
institutions like the **United Nations and the non-proliferation
regime**. Economic globalization]{.underline} can be disruptive, but it
also [creates wealth, and cooperation to **maintain financial
stability** can be **crucial to the lives of millions**]{.underline} of
Americans and foreigners alike. And whatever happens to economic
globalization, ecological globalization will remain. The politics of
science denial does not reverse physical forces. [States will need a
framework to enhance cooperation for uses of the sea, space, and
**coping with climate change.**]{.underline} Referring to such
frameworks as a liberal international order conflates the two aspects of
Wilson\'s liberal legacy. The degree of policy intervention a president
chooses regarding democracy promotion is different from the degree of
support for multilateral institutions designed to cope with security and
modern interconnectedness. [**We can criticize excesses like the effort
to democratize Iraq at the point of a gun** without criticizing the
overall liberal order of institutions that manage
interdependence.]{.underline} The U.S. and Global Public Goods After
Wilson sent two million Americans to fight in Europe and tipped the
outcome of the war, it was clear that the U.S. was not only the world\'s
largest economy, but also crucial to the global balance of power. In the
absence of a global government, the world depends on the most powerful
country to provide a degree of order and global public goods, such as
security, economic stability, and protection of global commons, like
freedom of the seas. But when the Senate rejected the Treaty of
Versailles and Wilson\'s League of Nations, the U.S. failed to act in
its new role, and instead continued to behave as a free rider in the
provision of global public goods (which Britain had led in the 19th
century but could no longer afford). Instead, America \"returned to
normal.\" Public opinion came to see intervention in World War I and
efforts to create a world order as a huge mistake. The United States
became isolationist in the 1930s, and not even the eloquence of Franklin
Roosevelt could persuade the American people to stand up to Hitler\'s
threat. The absence of an American-led liberal order resulted in an
immoral decade of economic depression, genocide, and world war.
[Roosevelt saw the mistakes of the 1930s and began a planning process to
create the Bretton Woods international economic institutions in 1944 and
the UN in 1945]{.underline}. The turning point was Harry Truman\'s
post-war decisions that led to permanent alliances and a military
presence abroad. When Britain was too weak to support Greece and Turkey
in 1947, the U.S. took its place. It invested heavily in the Marshall
Plan in 1948, created NATO a year later, and led a UN coalition that
fought in Korea in 1950. In 1960, Dwight Eisenhower signed a new
security treaty with Japan. [While Americans have had bitter debates and
partisan differences over intervention in countries such as Vietnam, and
more recently, Iraq, the issue of **a liberal international order has
been much less contentious.**]{.underline} These actions were part of
the strategy of containment of Soviet power, a realist policy that could
be interpreted in various ways. Some decisions had questionable ethical
justification, such as the overthrow of governments in Guatemala, Iran,
Congo, and elsewhere. Perhaps most notorious was the intervention in
Vietnam, where a series of American presidents feared the domestic
political consequences as much as the international ones. Intervention
was justified by a metaphor of dominos falling to communism, and the
ultimate effect of such a scenario on the balance of power in a bipolar
world. [While Americans have had bitter debates and partisan differences
over intervention in countries such as Vietnam, and more recently, Iraq,
the issue of a liberal international order has been much less
contentious.]{.underline} The theologian Reinhold Niebuhr praised the
\"fortunate vagueness of liberal internationalism\" which saves it from
ideological rigidity. Unfortunately, with victory in the Cold War and a
unipolar structure of world power, Americans succumbed to hubris. The
liberal scholar Tony Smith argues in Why Wilson Matters that the result
was \"neo-Wilsonianism,\" a combination of neoliberalism and
neoconservatism that combined global markets, forceful democracy
promotion, and American leadership. Meanwhile, at home, a significant
number of voters felt leftout politically and economically.

### US Heg -- 1AR

**Extend Binnendijk '19**

#### US leadership in NATO is key to the global perception of the US hegemony

**Wingrove '22** (Josh Wingrove - White House reporter, Bloomberg News
." NATO Nations' Faith in U.S. Leadership Saw Biden Bump, Poll Says."
Bloomberg. 3/22/22.
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-23/nato-nations-faith-in-u-s-leadership-saw-biden-bump-poll-says)

[People living in NATO nations reported sharply higher confidence in
U.S. global leadership]{.underline} during President Joe Biden's first
year in office than during the last year of Donald Trump's presidency,
according to newly released findings from Gallup, signaling support that
Biden will draw on this week in pushing for renewed pressure on Russia.
Polling from more than two dozen NATO nations showed nearly all saw an
increase in approval ratings in 2021, as compared to 2020, when asked
about perceptions of U.S. leadership abroad. The survey indicates that
[Europe's faith in the U.S. rebounded from lows seen in the Trump
administration.]{.underline} The median approval rating rose to 41%,
from 18% the previous year, the results show, though approval remains
below levels seen in the final years of the Obama administration. "[This
positions the U.S. very well]{.underline}, compared to the past," said
Julie Ray, a Gallup editor. "It's in a better position now than it was
with the previous administration, [in terms of audiences being receptive
and engaging in U.S. leadership and being open to it."]{.underline} The
data, compiled last year and released Wednesday, are part of a global
survey. Some of the findings were from before the chaotic U.S.
withdrawal from Afghanistan last August, while some were after. It's not
clear what impact that had, Ray said. By comparison, views toward
Russian and Chinese actions abroad were relatively unchanged, Ray added.

#### Lack of American leadership in NATO collapses US hegemony and democracy, while spurring an arms race

**Berlinkski**, PhD, **18** (Claire, American journalist and author --
doctorate in Internal Relations, "Europe's Dependence on the U.S. Was
All Part of the Plan,"
<https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/15/trump-nato-europe-history-dependence-219011)//EF>

What [Trump fails to understand]{.underline} is [that the disparity in
spending]{.underline}, with the U.S. paying more than its allies, [is
not a bug of the system. It is a feature. This is how the great postwar
statesmen designed it, and this]{.underline} immensely foresighted
[strategy has ensured the absence of great power conflict---and nuclear
war---for three-quarters of a century. The open, liberal world
order]{.underline} we know today [was built in the wake of World War II
and expanded after the collapse of the Soviet Union. By design, it is
led by the United States; **by design, it ensures permanent U.S.
military hegemony over Eurasia while uniting Europe under the U.S.'
protection**]{.underline}**. [The goal of this American grand strategy
is to prevent any single power from dominating the region and turning on
the United States and its allies. American hegemony serves, too, to
quell previously intractable regional rivalries, preventing further
world wars]{.underline}**. Dean Acheson, George Marshall and the other
great statesmen of their generation pursued this strategy because they
had learned, at unimaginable cost, that the eternal American fantasy of
forever being free of Europe---isolationism, or America Firstism, in
other words---was just that: a fantasy[.]{.underline} Four hundred
thousand American men lost their lives in the European theaters of the
First and Second World Wars. (American fatalities in all of the other
20th-century conflicts---including Vietnam, Korea and the Persian
Gulf---do not total one-quarter of that number.) [Our postwar
statesmen]{.underline} were neither weak nor incompetent. They [were the
architects of the greatest foreign policy triumph in U.S. history. So
successful was this policy that Americans now]{.underline}---most of
whom weren't alive to witness the enormity of these wars---[see peace,
unity, prosperity and stability as Europe's natural
state]{.underline}**. [This is an illusion. For centuries, Europe was
the fulcrum of global violence.]{.underline}** [With the age of global
exploration, it became the globe's primary exporter of
violence]{.underline}, the tempo and horror of the carnage rising every
century with improvements in technology for violence. [The Scramble for
Africa, the]{.underline} division and [colonization of that continent by
Europe, is a case in point. The 1884-85 Berlin West Africa
Conference]{.underline}, which assembled the representatives of 13
European powers to settle their colonial claims to Africa by diplomacy
in place of arms, [did lead to peace in Europe for]{.underline} several
[years.]{.underline} Africans, however, would not recall these years for
their exceptional comity. For example, the conference indulged King
Léopold II's claim that the Congo Free State was his private property.
[Ten million Congolese souls perished under his
ministrations]{.underline}. In recognizing this history of blood,
however, we must recognize something equally true: In the wake of World
War II, liberal democracy saw its fullest realization in the West. [This
flourishing of peace and human rights **cannot be explained by a sudden
outbreak of European pacifism**]{.underline}. (Consider the 1956 Suez
expedition, crushed by an infuriated President Dwight Eisenhower; or the
1954-62 Franco-Algerian War.) It happened because during World War II,
Europe destroyed itself, leaving the United States overwhelmingly
powerful by comparison, its only rival the Soviet Union[. Through the
application of economic, diplomatic and military force majeure, **the
United States suppressed Europe's internal security
competition.**]{.underline} This is why postwar Europe ceased to be the
world's leading exporter of violence and became, instead, the world's
leading exporter of luxury sedans. [Only America,]{.underline} and
massive power as the U.S. exercised it, [could have
pacified]{.underline} and unified [Europe]{.underline} under its aegis.
[No other continental country possessed half the world's GDP. No other
country had enough distance from Europe to be trusted]{.underline}, to a
large extent, by all parties and indifferent to its regional jealousies.
[No other country had a strategic, moral and economic vision for Europe
that its inhabitants could be persuaded]{.underline} gladly [to share**.
Indeed, Europeans cooperated with the U.S. program because it created
conditions under which both the United States and Europe flourished**.
The United States assisted Europe's postwar economic recovery with \$13
billion of aid in the form of the Marshall Plan.]{.underline} (In
today's dollars, roughly \$113 billion[.) It midwifed]{.underline} the
[groupings and treaties that would become the E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion. [It brought Europe under the U.S. security umbrella
with the NATO treaty.]{.underline} Article V of the treaty, its most
important element, declares that an attack on one member of NATO is an
attack on all members. [These policies were intended]{.underline} not
only to counter the Soviet Union, [but to condition Europe's prosperity
upon its integration into a single market]{.underline}, with free
movement of goods, capital and labor. The founders of these institutions
fully intended them to be the foundations of a United States of Europe,
much like the United States of America. **[Profound economic
interdependence,]{.underline}** they believed, **[would make further
European wars impossible.]{.underline}** At the same time, the United
States built an open, global order upon an architecture of specific
institutions: the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and
the International Court of Justice. **[This order is in many respects an
empire---a Pax Americana---but it is more humane than any empire that
preceded it, with institutions that are intended to benefit all
parties.]{.underline}** Postwar U.S. statesmen believed that prosperous,
liberal democracies that traded freely with each other would neither go
to war with each other nor the United States. [They
ascribed]{.underline}, in other words, [to the so-called Democratic
Peace theory]{.underline}---**[a theory with overwhelming empirical
support.]{.underline}** The U.S. military was always an integral part of
the plan to unite and rebuild Europe from the rubble. Since World War
II, U.S. troops have been deployed in Eurasia to ensure the continent
cannot be dominated by a single power capable of monopolizing its
resources and turning them against the U.S. The United States has built
overwhelmingly massive military assets there to deter local arms races
before they begin, and it has simultaneously assured those under U.S.
protection that there is no need to begin local arms races, for their
safety is guaranteed. **[American grand strategy rests upon the
credibility of its promise to protect American allies; this credibility
rests, in turn, upon U.S. willingness to display its
commitment.]{.underline}** [(The Berlin Airlift, when U.S. troops
airlifted supplies to Berlin during a Soviet blockade, was precisely
such a display.) **In return for the United States'
commitment,**]{.underline} **U.S. [allies have accepted America's
dominant role in the international system]{.underline}**. In the postwar
era, just as now, the enemies of liberal democracy sought to undermine
the order the U.S. was building. Precisely because the Marshall Plan
would strengthen and unite the West under the United States' protection,
the Soviet Union's propaganda organs cranked into overdrive to denounce
it. A cartoon, for example, published in Isvestia in 1949, depicted the
Marshall Plan's administrator, Paul Hoffman, as a fat capitalist bent on
destroying the sovereignty of European nations. The French paper
L\'Humanité, which reliably parroted Moscow's line, wrote, "After
disorganizing the national economies of the countries which are under
the American yoke, American leaders now intend conclusively to subjugate
the economy of these countries to their own interests." The Soviet
Union's criticism of the Marshall Plan and other American involvement in
Europe was eerily similar to the language Russia's now uses in its
campaign to undermine NATO and the EU. The vocabulary and tropes of
Russian propaganda are widely echoed, wittingly or unwittingly, by
far-right, far-left and other antiliberal politicians, parties and
movements throughout the West. With the men who built the postwar world
order now in their graves, and the memory of carnage and horror buried
with them, a very sizable constituency of Americans has forgotten that
their country built this system for a reason---that the United States
does not maintain its alliances as an act of foolish largesse. The
loudest exponent of the idea that the U.S. is getting rolled, that the
European Union was "created to destroy us," and that multilateral
institutions such as the World Trade Organization assault the
"sovereignty" of the nations concerned is, unfortunately, the president
of the United States. It's hard to understate how foolish and reckless
these notions are. History can be shoved down the memory hole, for a
time, but reality is never so cooperative. [Global free trade sustains
modern economic life. An interruption to this trade---carried out
chiefly on global shipping lanes safeguarded by the U.S.
military---**would bring modern life to an end**]{.underline}**.** The
Second World War proved not only that isolationism and American-Firstism
were fantasies, but exceptionally childish and dangerous ones, at
that**[. In the age of hyperglobalized trade, international air travel,
the internet, nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles,
these fantasies are even more childish and dangerous.]{.underline}** The
U.S. may be on another continent, but it is not on another planet. It is
true that the U.S. spends more on its military, in absolute dollars and
as a percentage of GDP, than any European country. That was always part
of the deal. The U.S. is a global superpower. It can fight a war
anywhere in the world, invade any country at will, and (at least in
theory) fight multiple simultaneous major wars---even in space. Of
course this costs more. It is in America's advantage to be the only
power on the planet that can do this. Conversely, it is not remotely in
America's advantage for other countries to spend as much money on their
militaries as we do. Europe is America's biggest export market, as
designed. We want Europeans to spend their money enjoying U.S. goods and
services, not razing Flanders to the ground yet again. Yet **[Trump's
refusal to deter our shared enemies and protect our allies risks
provoking a regional European arms race---exactly what the U.S. has
sought to avoid for 74 years.]{.underline}** It is an invitation to
adventurism from Putin. [**Trump's refusal to adopt the encouraging
language of past presidents**]{.underline} toward European integration,
language that until now [has been transformed into policy by
professional and experienced State Department employees**, puts further
strain on an already-weakened Europe**]{.underline}**.** Above all,
Trump's overt support for sordid, Kremlin-backed actors who seek to
undermine Europe's unity is unfathomable: How could it be in Europe's
interest, or in ours, for the American president to lend the United
States' prestige and support to Europe's Nazis, neo-Nazis, doctrinal
Marxists, populists, authoritarians, and ethnic supremacists,
particularly since all of them are ideologically hostile to the United
States? [The damage Trump has deliberately inflicted on Europe's
stability comes at a uniquely dangerous time. Democracy's so-called
third wave---the global blossoming of open political systems after the
Cold War---has long since receded**. A threat to liberal democracy, in
the form of a distinct, rival ideology---illiberal democracy---is
ascendant.** We see it today in Russia and Turkey]{.underline}---a
corrupt, oligarchic, kleptocratic and hollow form of democracy that
spreads and consolidates itself through the new technologies of the 21st
century. The global order the U.S. built was based on the principle that
only a world of liberal democracies can be peaceful and prosperous. That
principle is correct[. Should the unraveling of the order the U.S. built
proceed at this pace, **the world will soon be neither peaceful nor
prosperous.**]{.underline} Nor will the effects be confined to regions
distant from the United States. **[America will feel them gradually, and
then, probably, overnight---in the form of a devastating, sudden
shock.]{.underline}**

#### Collapse of NATO would wreck US hegemony -- removes network of diplomatic and military capabilities and forecloses agenda-setting power to new regional blocs

**Kaufmann,** Hertie School of Governance; **Laius,** Postdoctorate at
Otto Suhr Institute; **17** (Sonja, Mathis, "Ever closer or lost at sea?
Scenarios for the future of transatlantic relations,"

The decline of American hegemony has been proclaimed many times, but the
US has continued to be the sole superpower on the block. [Yet the 2016
election might go down in history as the turning point -- if the new
administration follows through with its plan to put 'America First' and
withdraws from international responsibilities. **This policy change puts
European collective action capacity to a test, leaving the EU to carry
on the torch of liberal values and democracy in the global world
order**.]{.underline} Following the Brexit shock, EU leaders agree on a
communications and legitimacy offensive to fend off populist movements
in the wake of Brexit. Europe's foreign policy apparatus evolves. As the
EEAS gains experience and fine-tunes its working relationship with
member states and the EU Commission, the changes intended by the Lisbon
treaty begin to materialize in practical terms. [The center of gravity
for day-to-day foreign policy moves to the European level, not least
because EU mxembers are happy to consolidate expensive foreign
operations. **At the same time, the United States decrease their
footprint in terms of both diplomatic and military capabilities
abroad.** US foreign policy focuses on core regions and tasks, which
means cutting back on large-scale diplomatic initiatives, early warning
and conflict resolution, or intelligence analysis]{.underline}. These
policy shifts draw heavy criticism from European allies and the
transatlantic relationship suffers − also because the new US
administration uses a different tone and style towards the old allies.
These organizational and strategic changes are reflected in policy
choices. [In United Nations negotiations on climate change, the EU is
the only actor that comes close to China's willingness and capacity for
leadership. Participants in transatlantic working groups discover that
their goals are not aligned.]{.underline} In addition, US negotiators
are much less enthusiastic about investing political capital and
resources in global governance. UN operational budgets across the board
are sharply reduced reflecting a reduction in US contributions that
cannot be compensated by others. Thus, while the UN remains a forum for
deliberation, its agencies lose practical relevance in global
governance. [At the same time, the member states of the European Union
come to terms with the fact that their transatlantic partner seems less
willing to assume a leadership role. A number of governments and the
foreign-policy institutions in Brussels take on more responsibility in
regional and global affairs. As a result, EU policymakers focus more
heavily on inter-regional cooperation with organizations from Africa,
Latin America and Asia. **A number of so-called 'intensive partnership'
treaties with regional blocs and individual emerging powers address
cross-border issues, such as migration and the fight against crime.** In
trade and investment, regional arrangements increasingly replace the
WTO, which is in hibernation due to the United States' refusal to
champion further trade liberalization on a global scale. NATO suffers
from funding cuts and is strictly limited to its core mandate for
territorial defense, while the UN Security Council drops from gridlock
to paralysis]{.underline}. Military interventions still take place --
but only based on ad-hoc coalitions. [For the EU this means creating a
more deeply integrated but still voluntary defense framework with a
focus on security in the near abroad and African countries of strategic
interest. A first indicator for this scenario is a shift in US foreign
policy from a global leadership role to a few selected initiatives.
**American agenda-setting power on the global stage is reduced as
foreign-policy priorities change, but also because European allies in
turn focus on other partners and opportunities**.]{.underline}
EU-internal changes in the institutional setup and practice of foreign
policy are another indicator to consider. The clearest sign of this
scenario, however, would be bolder and more controversial European
actions on the global arena -- both diplomatically and militarily.

#### Primacy prevents [great-power conflict]{.underline} --- multipolar revisionism [fragments]{.underline} the [global order]{.underline} and causes [nuclear war]{.underline}.

Each of these geopolitical challenges is different, and each reflects
the distinctive interests, ambitions, and history of the country
undertaking it. Yet [there is **growing cooperation** between the
countries that are **challenging** the **regional pillars of the
U.S.-led order.** **Russia** and **China** have **collaborated**
on]{.underline} issues such as energy, sales and development of
**[military technology]{.underline}**, opposition to additional U.S.
military deployments on the Korean peninsula, and naval exercises from
the South China Sea to the Baltic. In Syria, [Iran provided the **shock
troops** that helped keep Russia's ally]{.underline}, Bashar [al-Assad,
in power]{.underline}, as Moscow provided the air power and the
diplomatic cover. "[Our **cooperation** can **isolate
America**]{.underline}," supreme leader Ali Khamenei told Putin in 2017.
More broadly, [what links these challenges together is their
**opposition** to the constellation of **power, norms, and
relationships** that the U.S.-led order entails, and in their propensity
to use **violence**]{.underline}, coercion, and intimidation [as means
of making that opposition **effective**]{.underline}. Taken
collectively, [these challenges constitute a **geopolitical sea
change**]{.underline} from the post-Cold War era. [The revival of
**great-power competition** entails]{.underline} higher international
tensions than the world has known for decades, and the revival of
[**arms races, security dilemmas**, and **other artifacts** of a more
**dangerous past**. It entails **sharper conflicts** over the
international rules]{.underline} of the road on issues ranging from
freedom of navigation to the illegitimacy of altering borders by force,
[and **intensifying competitions** over states that reside at the
intersection of rival powers' **areas of interest**]{.underline}. It
requires confronting the prospect that [**rival powers** could
**overturn** the **favorable regional balances** that have
**underpinned** the U.S.-led order for decades, and that they might
construct **rival spheres of influence**]{.underline} from which America
and the liberal ideas it has long promoted would be excluded. Finally,
it necessitates recognizing that [great-power rivalry could lead to
**great-power war**]{.underline}, a prospect that seemed to have
followed the Soviet empire onto the ash heap of history. Both
[**Beijing** and **Moscow** are]{.underline}, after all, [**optimizing
their forces** and **exercising aggressively** in preparation for
potential **conflicts** with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and its allies; [Russian doctrine explicitly
emphasizes the]{.underline} limited [use of **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} to achieve escalation dominance in a war with
Washington. In Syria, [U.S. and Russian forces even came into **deadly
contact**]{.underline} in early 2018. American airpower decimated a
contingent of government-sponsored Russian mercenaries that was
attacking a base at which U.S. troops were present, an incident
demonstrating the increasing boldness of Russian operations and the
corresponding potential for escalation. [The world]{.underline} has not
yet returned to the epic clashes for global dominance that characterized
the twentieth century, but it [has returned to the **historical norm**
of **great-power struggle**]{.underline}, with all the associated
dangers. Those dangers may be even greater than most observers
appreciate, because if today's great-power competitions are still most
intense at the regional level, who is to say where these competitions
will end? By all appearances, [Russia **does not simply want to be** a
"**regional power**"]{.underline} (as Obama cuttingly described it) that
dominates South Ossetia and Crimea.37 [It **aspires** to the **deep
European** and **extra-regional impact** that **previous incarnations**
of the Russian state enjoyed]{.underline}. Why else would Putin boast
about how far his troops can drive into Eastern Europe? [**Why else**
would Moscow]{.underline} be **[deploy]{.underline}**ing military power
[into the **Middle East?**]{.underline} [**Why else** would it be
continuing to cultivate]{.underline} intelligence and [**military
relationships** in regions as remote as **Latin America?**]{.underline}
Likewise, [China is **today** focused primarily on securing its own
**geopolitical neighborhood**, but its ambitions for **tomorrow** are
**clearly much bolder.**]{.underline} Beijing probably does not envision
itself fully overthrowing the international order, simply because it has
profited far too much from the U.S.-anchored global economy. Yet [China
has nonetheless positioned itself for a **global challenge** to **U.S.
influence**]{.underline}. [Chinese military forces are deploying **ever
farther** from China's immediate periphery; Beijing has **projected
power** into the **Arctic** and **established bases** and **logistical
points** in the **Indian Ocean** and **Horn of Africa**]{.underline}.
Popular Chinese movies depict Beijing replacing Washington as the
dominant actor in sub-Saharan Africa---a fictional representation of a
real-life effort long under way. [The **Belt and Road Initiative**
bespeaks an aspiration to **link** China to countries throughout
**Central Asia, the Middle East, and Europe**]{.underline}; BRI, AIIB,
and RCEP look like the beginning of an alternative institutional
architecture to rival Washington's. In 2017, [Xi]{.underline} Jinping
[told the]{.underline} [Nineteenth National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party that Beijing could]{.underline} now "**[take center
stage in the world]{.underline}**" [and act as an **alternative** to
**U.S. leadership**]{.underline}.38 These ambitions may or may not be
realistic. But they demonstrate just how significantly the world's
leading authoritarian powers desire to shift the global environment over
time. The **[revisionism]{.underline}** we are seeing today [may
therefore be **only the beginning**]{.underline}. As [China's power
**continues to grow,** or if it is successful in **dominating the
Western Pacific**, it will **surely move on** to **grander
endeavors**]{.underline}. If Russia reconsolidates control over the
former Soviet space, it may seek to bring parts of the former Warsaw
Pact to heel. Historically, [this has been a recurring pattern of
**great-power behavior**---interests **expand with power**, the appetite
**grows** with the eating, **risk-taking** increases as **early
gambles** are seen to **pay off**]{.underline}.39 This pattern is
precisely why the revival of great-power competition is so
concerning---because [**geopolitical revisionism** by **unsatisfied
major powers** has so often presaged **intensifying international
conflict**,]{.underline} confrontation, [and]{.underline} even
**[war]{.underline}**. The great-power behavior occurring today
represents the warning light flashing on the dashboard. It tells us
there may be still-greater traumas to come. The threats today are
compelling and urgent, and there may someday come a time when the
balance of power has shifted so markedly that the postwar international
system cannot be sustained. Yet that moment of failure has not yet
arrived, and so the goal of U.S. strategy should be not to hasten it by
giving up prematurely, but to push it off as far into the future as
possible. Rather [than simply **acquiescing**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} the **[decline]{.underline}** of a world it spent
generations building, [America should **aggressively bolster its
defenses**, with an eye to **preserving** and perhaps even selectively
**advancing** its remarkable achievements.]{.underline}

As William Wohlforth has noted, **[American primacy]{.underline}** and
activism [acted as a **powerful deterrent to great-power conflict** by
creating **enormous disincentives** for Russia, China, or other actors
to incur the "focused enmity" of the **United States**]{.underline}.11
The persistence and even extension of [the U.S. security blanket
**smothered potential instability** in]{.underline} unsettled [regions
such as **Eastern Europe**, while removing any possibility
of]{.underline} German or Japanese **[revanchism]{.underline}**---a
prospect much feared in the early 1990s---[by keeping]{.underline} those
[countries]{.underline} **[tightly lashed]{.underline}** [to
Washington]{.underline}. [American intervention helped **extinguish
bloody conflicts** in the **Balkans**]{.underline} before they could
spread to neighboring countries; [U.S.]{.underline} diplomatic and
**[military pressure]{.underline}** [kept **aggressive tyrannies** such
as **Iraq, Iran**, and **North Korea bottled up a**nd helped **slow the
spread** of **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. U.S. support helped
democratic forces triumph in countries from Haiti to Poland, as the
number of democracies rose from 76 in 1990 to 120 in 2000; [America
**crucially assisted** the advance of **globalization** and the broad
prosperity that came with it by promoting **pro-market policies** and
providing the **necessary climate** of **reassurance** and
**stability**]{.underline}.12

### AT Entanglement

#### Most comprehensive research shows US entanglement is rare

relations, Princeton University. Director, Center for Analysis of U.S.

[U.S. allies and partners sometimes become involved in conflicts
contrary to direct U.S. interests]{.underline}, whether because of
emboldenment or for other reasons. In this chapter, [we ask whether the
United States defends its allies and partners in such situations because
of concerns about U.S. credibility]{.underline}. We also consider
whether the United States becomes involved in conflict because of other
forms of interest expansion, such as socialization with its allies and
partners over the course of the relationship. In other words, [**we ask
whether entanglement** ultimately **occurs in U.S. alliances** and
partnerships]{.underline}. One challenge in answering this question is
that [there is no clear standard]{.underline} for the extent to which
alliance considerations must play a role in U.S. decision making for a
case to qualify as entanglement. There are usually many factors that
affect state decisions about engaging in conflict, especially entering a
war.1 Therefore, [demanding that alliance dynamics be the only
explanation for U.S. entry to conflict would be setting too high a
bar]{.underline}. Rather, in this chapter, we discuss cases in which
entanglement contributed to a U.S. decision to enter a conflict. As
research in this area continues, it would be helpful to identify not
just how often these dynamics take place but also how important they are
relative to other factors. The extent to which entanglement plays a role
varies in each of the cases that we discuss in this chapter. In every
case that we discuss, [there are multiple reasons that the United States
is engaged in conflict,]{.underline} even though we focus primarily on
describing entanglement dynamics. More research is needed to determine
how much these dynamics contributed in each individual case. In the
previous chapter, [we identified cases in which the United States chose
not to enter wars to support allies and partners]{.underline} that
initiated conflict despite U.S. objections. For example, the United
States did not fight to support Britain and France during the Suez
Crisis, in 1956. The United States thought that the intervention was
misguided, would harm Western relations with countries in the Middle
East and Africa, would undermine U.S. domestic political support for
NATO, and would lead to a confrontation with the Soviet Union.2
Similarly, the United States did not enter the conflict to support
Israel in the Six-Day War or Georgia in its 2008 war with Russia.
Ashford also notes that the United States chose not to intervene in
Rwanda despite allies and partners prompting it to do so.3 [Beckley's
analysis is the most comprehensive analysis of the U.S. experience with
entanglement.]{.underline} [He examined every interstate conflict the
United States engaged in between 1948 and 2010 and **asked whether U.S.
involvement was due to alliance entanglement**.]{.underline} He also
included the U.S. partnerships with Israel and Taiwan in the analysis.
Beckley argues that [direct U.S. interests drove U.S. involvement in
most conflicts but finds evidence of entanglement dynamics in five
cases]{.underline}: the 1954--1955 and 1995--1996 Taiwan Strait crises,
the Vietnam War, and the U.S. interventions in Bosnia and Kosovo. Even
in these cases, though, [Beckley **downplays the importance of
entanglement by arguing that direct U.S. interests dominated the
decision** to intervene.]{.underline} In nine other cases, Beckley finds
that entanglement dynamics may have occurred but dismisses them given
lower levels of U.S. military involvement. Ultimately, **[Beckley
concludes that entanglement is rare]{.underline}**.4

#### The wording of Article 5 strategically prevents entanglement

**Priebe et al '21** (Miranda Priebe - Ph.D. in political science,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology; M.P.A. in international
relations, Princeton University. Director, Center for Analysis of U.S.
Grand Strategy; Senior Political Scientist. " Do Alliances and
Partnerships Entangle the U.S. in Conflict." RAND Corporation. August
2021.
https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA700/RRA739-3/RAND_RRA739-3.pdf)

[We]{.underline} next [consider whether the United States has tried to
reduce the risk of entanglement through the negotiation of conditional
alliance terms]{.underline}. [The North Atlantic Treaty is an example of
a conditional defense agreement because it **does not require an
automatic response** to an attack on a NATO member.]{.underline} Rather,
[Article 5 of the treaty calls on each member to take "such action as it
deems necessary"]{.underline} if another member is attacked.8 [This
choice of wording stemmed]{.underline}, at least in part, [from U.S.
congressional concerns that earlier drafts contained language that
interfered with Congress's constitutional power to declare
war]{.underline}.9 The North Atlantic Treaty is also geographically
limited to Europe and North America and does not include, for example,
commitments to defend against attacks on allies' colonial holdings.10 As
noted earlier, all [U.S. alliances are conditional]{.underline},
although the degree and nature of conditionality vary.

#### Arguments of US entanglement are too broad -- further research needed

**Priebe et al '21** (Miranda Priebe - Ph.D. in political science,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology; M.P.A. in international
relations, Princeton University. Director, Center for Analysis of U.S.
Grand Strategy; Senior Political Scientist. " Do Alliances and
Partnerships Entangle the U.S. in Conflict." RAND Corporation. August
2021.
https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA700/RRA739-3/RAND_RRA739-3.pdf)

Although more research is needed on the U.S. experience of entanglement,
there are some useful findings that we can offer U.S. policymakers based
on the existing literature. [In at Least Five Cases, Entanglement
Dynamics Contributed to, but Were Not the Only Cause of, U.S.
Involvement in Conflict]{.underline}; More Research Is Needed on How
Prevalent and Consequential These Dynamics Are. The existing literature
shows that the United States became involved in two crises over Taiwan
at least in part because of concerns about U.S. credibility being on the
line. [Concerns about U.S. credibility with allies, partners, and
adversaries appear to have contributed to U.S. involvement in these
cases]{.underline} as well as in the Korean War and Vietnam War. The
U.S. intervention in Libya also displays entanglement dynamics because
the United States supported its allies in a conflict despite the lack of
a vital U.S. interest at stake. In each case, **[entanglement dynamics
contributed to but were not the only cause of a U.S.
intervention.]{.underline}** Scholars have suggested [several other
potential cases of entanglement dynamics at work, including U.S.
involvement in the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo.]{.underline} However,
[**more in-depth analysis** of these cases **is needed to make a
definitive conclusion about the role of entanglement**
dynamics.]{.underline} At the same time, [entanglement does not occur in
every case of conflict involving U.S. allies and partners.]{.underline}
The United States has chosen, in some cases, such as the Suez Crisis,
not to support its allies and partners that become involved in conflicts
contrary to U.S. interests. This mixed picture suggests that [more
research is needed on U.S. entanglement dynamics]{.underline} to
determine how prevalent and consequential they are and when they are
most likely to take place. [For some analysts, the small number of known
cases of entanglement dynamics across the history of U.S. security
relationships suggests that entanglement concerns should not weigh
heavily in decisions about U.S. alliance and partnership choices going
forward. For others, even a small number of consequential examples is
troubling.]{.underline} Ultimately, [policymakers and the public have to
make a normative choice about how to weigh these risks against other
costs and benefits of U.S. alliances and partnerships]{.underline}.
[More empirical work on entanglement will provide a stronger basis for
these assessments.]{.underline}

#### (AT BOSNIA) Not enough evidence that entanglement spurred US involvement in Bosnia -- it was more likely a case of interest expansion

**Priebe et al '21** (Miranda Priebe - Ph.D. in political science,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology; M.P.A. in international
relations, Princeton University. Director, Center for Analysis of U.S.
Grand Strategy; Senior Political Scientist. " Do Alliances and
Partnerships Entangle the U.S. in Conflict." RAND Corporation. August
2021.
https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA700/RRA739-3/RAND_RRA739-3.pdf)

Although the methodological issues above mean that there might be cases
of entanglement that Beckley missed or that are more meaningful than he
allows, there are also cases in which the evidence that he presents is
not decisive. This is because [Beckley asks whether alliance
considerations affected U.S. decisionmaking in each case but does not
provide evidence that alliance considerations constituted
entanglement.]{.underline} For example, Beckley notes that, after NATO
made threats against Serbia for its actions in Kosovo in 1998, the
United States felt that NATO credibility was on the line. When Serbia
did not meet NATO demands, the United States felt that NATO had to
intervene. This is certainly an alliance consideration. However, Beckley
does not show what made U.S. leaders put NATO credibility at stake by
issuing the threat in the first place. Other analysis suggests that U.S.
humanitarian concerns motivated the United States to seek NATO
involvement and that allies tried to restrain the United States from
using force earlier in the crisis.25 [Similar questions surround the
U.S. intervention in Bosnia in the 1990s.]{.underline} [The Clinton
administration had said that it would intervene to protect NATO allies
with peacekeepers in Bosnia, which Beckley argues was intended to keep
these allies from pulling their forces.]{.underline} When these
peacekeepers were seriously threatened in 1995, [the administration
intervened in part to help its allies and because it saw NATO
credibility as being on the line]{.underline}.26 However, [Beckley does
not explain why the United States believed that NATO's credibility was
at stake,]{.underline} why the United States promoted air strikes as
early as 1993, [or why the United States had become involved in military
operations related to Bosnia]{.underline}, such as Operation Deny
Flight, prior to 1995.27 Ultimately, **[more evidence is necessary to
show that entanglement drove U.S. involvement in the wars in
Bosnia]{.underline}** and Kosovo. For example, [future analysis could
consider the possibility that this and the earlier intervention in
Bosnia might be a case of interest expansion, in which the United States
came to see any instability in Europe as a threat to U.S.
allies]{.underline}.28 In both cases, more in-depth analysis will be
possible as government documents from this period are declassified.

#### Alliances don't cause entanglement and promote restraint

**Beckley 15** Michael Beckley is Fellow in the International Security
Program at Harvard Kennedy School\'s Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs and assistant professor of political science at
Tufts University.6-9-2015, \"The Myth of Entangling Alliances,\" War on
the Rocks,
<https://warontherocks.com/2015/06/the-myth-of-entangling-alliances/> -
BS

For the first 165 years of its history, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [did not form any
**alliances**]{.underline} besides the one it signed with France [during
the Revolutionary War]{.underline}. Instead, U[.S. leaders followed
George Washington's advice to "steer clear of **permanent
alliance**]{.underline} with any portion of the foreign world," [a
recommendation subsequently enshrined in Thomas Jefferson's inaugural
pledge]{.underline}: "**[Peace]{.underline}**, commerce, and honest
friendship with all nations; **[entangling alliances with
none]{.underline}**." Since World War II, however, U[.S. leaders have
reversed course]{.underline} and **[signed defense pacts]{.underline}**
with more than 60 countries. As a result, [the United States is legally
obligated to defend a **patchwork of nations**]{.underline} that spans
five continents, [contains 25 percent of the earth's]{.underline}
[population]{.underline}, and accounts for nearly 75 percent of global
economic output. To what extent does this massive commitment entangle
the United States in wars it would otherwise avoid? This is a pivotal
question for U.S. foreign policy --- and one that increasingly divides
U.S. policymakers from many of the nation's most prominent international
relations scholars. U.S. **[political leaders]{.underline}** almost
[uniformly support allied engagement]{.underline}, and President Barack
**[Obama]{.underline}** recently **[reaffirmed]{.underline}** U.S.
[commitments to defend allies during crises between North and South
Korea, **Iran and Israel**]{.underline}, Russia and
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**, and China on the one hand and Japan and the
Philippines on the other. A growing number of scholars, however, argue
that [such commitments are dangerous and should be
abandoned]{.underline}. According to these scholars, America's
**[alliances]{.underline}** [are not assets but rather "**transmission**
belts for war]{.underline}" that "**[risk roping the United
States]{.underline}** **[into conflicts]{.underline}** over
strategically marginal territory." [Several scholars even compare the
U.S. alliance]{.underline} network to the [tangled web of European
security commitments]{.underline} that [helped catalyze World War
I.]{.underline} To avoid getting sucked into foreign wars, these
scholars argue, the United States should scale back its alliance network
or scrap it altogether --- measures that, if implemented, would
constitute the biggest shift in U.S. grand strategy in two generations.
Are these fears of entangling alliances warranted? To find out, **[I
analyzed every U.S. military conflict]{.underline}** **[since
1948]{.underline}** (the year the United States signed its first
peacetime alliance) [and asked a basic question]{.underline}: To what
extent was U.S. involvement driven by formal alliance commitments? [The
results]{.underline}, which are published in an article in International
Security**[, are surprising]{.underline}**: U.S.
**[entanglement]{.underline}** almost **[never happens]{.underline}**.
Over a 65-year period in which [the United States had more than **60**
formal **allies**]{.underline}, [there have been only **five**
ostensible]{.underline} **[episodes]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}**
U.S. **[entanglement]{.underline}** --- the 1954 and 1995/96 Taiwan
Strait Crises; the Vietnam War; and the interventions in Bosnia and
Kosovo in the 1990s --- and even these cases are far from clear-cut. In
each case there were other important drivers of U.S. involvement, U.S.
policymakers carefully limited support for allies, allies restrained the
United States from escalating its involvement, the United States
deterred adversaries and allies from escalating the conflict, or all of
the above. [Against this limited evidence of entanglement]{.underline},
I [find many cases in which alliances]{.underline} **[restrained the
United States]{.underline}**, or in which [the United States restrained
its allies or sidestepped costly commitments]{.underline}. I only
[examine U.S. military conflicts]{.underline} and therefore cannot
evaluate fully the prevalence of such cases of peace, but even within my
biased sample, there are at least four cases in which alliances
prevented U.S. escalation, and another seven cases in which the United
States reneged on security commitments and/or restrained an ally from
attacking a third party. Of course, [the United States has fought
alongside allies on numerous occasions]{.underline}. **[But in most
cases]{.underline}**, U.S. **[actions]{.underline}** were **[driven by
an alignment of interests between the United States and its
allies]{.underline}**, **[not by alliance obligations]{.underline}**. In
fact, in many cases, U[.S. policymakers were the main advocates of
military intervention and cajoled reluctant allies to join the
fight.]{.underline} At worst, therefore, [alliances have had a mixed
effect on U.S. involvement in military conflicts]{.underline} ---
**[some alliances]{.underline}** at times have
**[encouraged]{.underline}** U.S. **[military]{.underline}**
**[involvement]{.underline}**, [others have discouraged]{.underline} it,
and [some have simply been ignored by U.S. policymakers]{.underline}.
The risk of entanglement is not trivial, but historically, U.S.
**[policymakers]{.underline}** have **[managed this risk]{.underline}**
by [inserting loopholes into alliance agreements]{.underline}, shirking
costly commitments, [maintaining a diversified alliance portfolio
t]{.underline}hat generates offsetting demands from different allies,
and using explicit alliance commitments to deter adversaries and
restrain allies from initiating or escalating conflicts. Ultimately,
**[this indicates that allied engagement]{.underline}** **[does not
preclude,]{.underline}** and may even facilitate, U[.S. military
restraint]{.underline}. [When the United States has overreached
militarily, **the main cause**]{.underline} [has not been entangling
alliances]{.underline} [but rather what Richard Betts calls
"self-entrapment]{.underline}" --- the tendency of U.S. leaders [to
define national interests expansively]{.underline}, to exaggerate the
magnitude of foreign threats, and to underestimate the costs of military
intervention. Scrapping **[alliances]{.underline}** will not [correct
these bad habits. In]{.underline} fact, **[disengaging]{.underline}**
from [alliances may simply unshackle the United States and enable it to
intervene recklessly abroad while leaving it without partners to share
the burden]{.underline} when those interventions go awry. [A better
route to a disciplined defense policy would be to (1)]{.underline}
**[bolster]{.underline}** congressional **[constraints on the
president's ability to send]{.underline}** U.S. **[forces]{.underline}**
into battle; (2) [develop guidelines governing the use of
force]{.underline} and make [them the centerpiece]{.underline} of
[national debate before every potential military intervention; and (3)
retain allies, who can provide U.S. leaders]{.underline} with a second
opinion on the merits of potential interventions, political cover when
U.S. leaders decide not to intervene, and troops, supplies,
intelligence, and money when the United States does intervene. In short,
military **[restraint]{.underline}** **[is best pursued through allied
engagement]{.underline}**, burden-sharing, and domestic reform ---
**[not retrenchment]{.underline}**. To be sure, [some security
commitments may need to be revised or dissolved for specific
reasons]{.underline}. But [history]{.underline} [shows]{.underline} that
most **[allies]{.underline}** most of the time help **[keep U.S. troops
at home]{.underline}** by [bearing some of the burden]{.underline} of
U.S. **[wars]{.underline}** and by **[encouraging]{.underline}** [the
United States to stay out of wars altogether]{.underline}. Large-scale
retrenchment would sacrifice these and other benefits of alliances while
doing little to compel U.S. leaders to define national interests
modestly or choose military interventions selectively. How **[to avoid
foolish wars]{.underline}** and achieve strategic solvency will continue
to be the subject of debate, but [those debates will be more productive
if they focus on domestic culprits rather than foreign
friends.]{.underline} Americans tend to blame their military
misadventures on allies, but the blame for these debacles, and the
responsibility for avoiding future fiascos, lies at home.

nuclear forces on high alert dangerous, escalatory and totally
unacceptable,]{.underline} while NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
criticized them as aggressive and irresponsible. However, U.S. officials
also immediately made clear [they had seen no signs Russian forces had

issue. \"[He is trying to scare the West.\"]{.underline} HOW MIGHT
RUSSIA USE A NUCLEAR WEAPON? While Western nations have poured arms into

the ground in Ukraine was \"not on the table.\" read more The United
States and its allies have no desire to get into a conventional shooting
war with Russia, let alone do anything that might spark a nuclear
exchange. If Russia were to use nuclear weapons, experts saw a range of
possibilities, from a detonation over the Black Sea or an uninhabited
part of Ukraine to demonstrate its capabilities to a strike against a
Ukrainian military target or on a city. However, [using a nuclear weapon
in Ukraine could endanger Russian troops and draw radioactive blowback
on Russia itself]{.underline}.

#### Without NATO troops in Ukraine, Putin won't use nukes

**Dhanesha '22** (Neel Dhanesha - Recode & Science Fellow. "How to think
about the risk of nuclear war, according to 3 experts." Vox. 2/27/22.
https://www.vox.com/22951004/nuclear-weapons-russia-ukraine-war-putin)

[How worried should we be about the threat of nuclear weapons right
now?]{.underline} When Russia first invaded Ukraine, the scholars who
spoke to Vox said a nuclear strike is unlikely but still a cause for
concern, given that the invasion introduced the largest military
operation in Europe since the Second World War. "I'm more worried than I
was a week ago," Kristensen said. He pointed out that NATO increased its
readiness levels for "all contingencies" in response to Putin's speech,
and with increased military buildup comes increased uncertainty. "That's
the fog of war, so to speak," Kristensen said. "Out of that can come
twists and turns that take you down a path that you couldn't predict a
week ago." When asked about Putin's decision to place his nuclear forces
on higher alert, Kristensen said, "There is nothing in Russia's stated
public nuclear doctrine that justifies this." He added, "Putin has now
taken yet another step that unnecessarily escalates the situation to
what appears to be a direct nuclear threat." [Matthew Bunn]{.underline},
a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School and former adviser to
President Bill Clinton's Office of Science and Technology Policy,
initially [told]{.underline} Vox, ["I think there is **virtually no
chance nuclear weapons are going to be used** in the Ukraine
situation]{.underline}." [The main reason]{.underline}, Bunn said[, is
that the United States and its NATO allies have made it clear that they
will not send troops to Ukraine. Without the threat of military
intervention, Putin has little reason to use his nuclear
weapons,]{.underline} especially since Russia has a staggering numbers
advantage over the Ukrainian military. Bunn qualified his statements
after Putin's escalation. "No one outside of Putin's inner circle knows
for sure why Putin has taken this action," he said in an email. "My
guess --- and it's only that --- is that it is intended as further
signaling to deter anyone in the West from even thinking about
intervening militarily to help Ukraine." Paul Hare, senior lecturer in
global studies at Boston University, argued that Putin's real goal is to
"swallow Ukraine" and restore the historical power of imperial Russia.
"His objective is not to bring the world to nuclear war," Hare said.

#### Nuclear war impacts are overexaggerated -- won't cause extinction

**Daley '17** (Beth Daley -- Editor and general manager of The
Conversation. "The understandable fear of nuclear weapons doesn't match
reality." The Conversation. 3/14/17.
https://theconversation.com/the-understandable-fear-of-nuclear-weapons-doesnt-match-reality-73563)

[Nuclear weapons are unambiguously the most destructive weapons on the
planet]{.underline}. Pound for pound, they are the most lethal weapons
ever created, capable of killing millions. Millions live in fear that
these weapons will be used again, with all the potential consequences.
[However, **the destructive power of these weapons has been vastly
exaggerated**, albeit for good reasons. Public fear of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} being used in anger, whether by terrorists or
nuclear-armed nations, [has risen]{.underline} once again in recent
years. [This is in no small part thanks to the current political climate
between states such as the US and Russia]{.underline} and the various
nuclear tests conducted by North Korea. But whenever we talk about
nuclear weapons, it's easy to get carried away with doomsday scenarios
and apocalyptic language. As the historian Spencer Weart once argued:
"You say 'nuclear bomb' and everybody immediately thinks of the end of
the world." Yet the means necessary to produce a nuclear bomb, let alone
set one off, remain incredibly complex -- and while the damage that
would be done if someone did in fact detonate one might be very serious
indeed, the chances that it would mean "the end of the world" are
vanishingly small. In his 2013 book Command and Control, the author Eric
Schlosser tried to scare us into perpetual fear of nuclear weapons by
recounting stories of near misses and accidents involving nuclear
weapons. [One such event, the 1980 Damascus incident, saw a Titan II
intercontinental ballistic missile explode at its remote Arkansas launch
facility]{.underline} after a maintenance crew accidentally ruptured its
fuel tank. [Although the warhead involved in the incident didn't
detonate]{.underline}, [Schlosser claims that "if it had, much of
Arkansas would be gone".]{.underline} But [that's not quite the
case]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} nine-megaton thermonuclear
[warhead]{.underline} on the Titan II missile [had a blast radius of
10km]{.underline}, or an area of about 315km². The state of Arkansas
spreads over 133,733km², [meaning the weapon would have caused
destruction across 0.2% of the state]{.underline}. That would naturally
have been a terrible outcome, but certainly not the catastrophe that
Schlosser evokes. Overdoing it [Claims exaggerating the effects of
nuclear weapons have become commonplace]{.underline}, especially after
the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the early War on Terror
years, Richard Lugar, a former US senator and chair of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, argued that terrorists armed with nuclear
weapons pose an existential threat to the Western way of life. What he
failed to explain is how. [It is by no means certain that a single
nuclear detonation]{.underline} (or even several) [would do away with
our current way of life]{.underline}. Indeed, [**we're still here
despite having nuked our own planet more than 2,000 times**
--]{.underline} a tally expressed beautifully in this video by Japanese
artist Isao Hashimoto). While the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty forced
nuclear tests underground, [around 500 of all the nuclear weapons
detonated were unleashed in the Earth's atmosphere]{.underline}. [This
includes the world's largest ever nuclear detonation, the 57-megaton
bomb]{.underline} known as Tsar Bomba, detonated by the Soviet Union on
October 30 1961. Tsar Bomba was more than 3,000 times more powerful than
the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. That is immense destructive power -- but
as one physicist explained, it's only "one-thousandth the force of an
earthquake, one-thousandth the force of a hurricane". [The Damascus
incident proved how incredibly hard it is to set off a nuclear bomb and
the limited effect that would have come from just one warhead
detonating]{.underline}. Despite this, [some scientists have
controversially argued that an even limited all-out nuclear war might
lead to a so-called nuclear winter]{.underline}, since the smoke and
debris created by very large bombs could block out the sun's rays for a
considerable amount of time. [To inflict such ecological societal
annihilation with weapons alone, we would have to detonate hundreds if
not thousands of thermonuclear devices in a short time.]{.underline}
[Even in such extreme conditions, the area actually devastated by the
bombs would be limited]{.underline}: for example, [2,000 one-megaton
explosions with a destructive radius of five miles each would directly
destroy less than 5% of the territory of the US.]{.underline}

#### No nuclear war extinction -- preempts all of their responses. 

Brian **Martin 82** \[Australian National University, Canberra.
"Critique of Nuclear Extinction." ISSN 0022-3433, Journal of Peace and
Research. No. 4, Vol. XIX, (1982).
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/002234338201900401\]

The available [evidence suggests]{.underline} that [a major **global
nuclear war**]{.underline}, one [involving the explosion of most of the
nuclear bombs that exist]{.underline}, **[would kill 400 to 450 million
people]{.underline}**, mostly in the US, Europe and Soviet Union, and to
a lesser extent China and Japan. Direct effects. [Most of the deaths and
injuries from a nuclear war would be due to blast and heat]{.underline}
in the neighbourhood of each explosion and to exposure during the first
few days to fallout deposited downwind of explosions at or near the
surface of the earth.3 The number of people killed would be higher if
population centres around the world were systematically bombed4 or if
the cores of many nuclear power plants were dispersed. [The number would
be **lower if** substantial numbers of **nuclear weapons were used on
military targets** or if more than minimal civil defence measures were
used.]{.underline}

Indirect effects. (a) **[Global fallout]{.underline}**. [The main effect
of long-term fallout]{.underline} would be to increase the rate of
cancer and genetic defects by a small percentage. Tens of millions might
be affected worldwide over a period of many decades, but this [would
provide **no threat to the survival of the human species**.]{.underline}
6

\(b\) **[Ozone]{.underline}**. [Nuclear war would cause an increase in
ultraviolet light]{.underline} from the sun which reaches the earth's
surface, [due to reductions in stratospheric ozone]{.underline} caused
by its catalytic destruction by nitrogen oxides produced in nuclear
explosions. This would increase the incidence of skin cancer (which is
mostly non-lethal) and possibly alter agricultural productivity, [but
would be **most unlikely to cause widespread death**]{.underline}. 7

\(c\) Fires. Extensive fires caused directly or indirectly by nuclear
explosions would fill the lower atmosphere in the northern hemisphere
with so much particulate matter that the amount of sunlight reaching the
earth's surface could be greatly reduced for a few months. If this
occurred during the northern spring or summer, one consequence would be
greatly reduced agricultural production and possible widescale
starvation. 8

\(d\) **[Climatic changes]{.underline}**. Such changes might be caused,
for example, by injection of nitrogen oxides or particulate matter into
the upper atmosphere. The more calamitous possibilities include a
heating trend leading to melting of the polar ice caps, the converse
possibility of a new ice age, and the changing of climatic patterns
leading to drought or unstable weather in areas of current high
agricultural productivity.9 [The rate of impact of such climatic change
is likely to be sufficiently slow]{.underline} - decades, or years in
some cases - [**for the avoidance of the death** of a substantial
portion of the world's population]{.underline} through climatic change.

\(e\) Agricultural or economic breakdown. A major possible source of
widespread death could be the failure of agricultural or economic
recovery in heavily bombed areas, followed by starvation or social
breakdown. Agricultural failure could occur due to reduced sunlight due
to fires or to induced changes in weather. An agricultural or economic
collapse would also increase the likelihood of epidemics. If
agricultural or economic breakdown followed by widespread starvation or
epidemics occurred in heavily bombed areas, and no effective rescue
operations were mounted by less damaged neighbouring areas, then it is
conceivable that many tens or even several hundred million more people
could die, mainly in the US, Soviet Union and Europe. 10

\(f\) **[Synergistic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[unpredicted
effects]{.underline}**. The interaction of different effects, such as
weakened resistance to disease due to high radiation exposure or to
shortages of food, could well increase the death toll significantly.
[These consequences would mostly be confined to **heavily bombed**
areas.]{.underline} Finally, there is the possibility of effects
currently dismissed or not predicted leading to many more deaths from
nuclear war. I I

To summarise the above points, a major global nuclear war in which
population centres in the US, Soviet Union, Europe and China ware
targeted, with no effective civil defence measures taken, could kill
directly perhaps 400 to 450 million people. Induced effects, in
particular starvation or epidemics following agricultural failure or
economic breakdown, might add up to several hundred million deaths to
the total, though this is most uncertain. [Such an eventuality would be
a **catastrophe** of enormous proportions]{.underline}, [but it is far
from **extinction**.]{.underline} [Even in the most extreme case there
would remain alive some **4000 million people**, about nine-tenths of
the world's population]{.underline}, **[most of them unaffected
physically by the nuclear war]{.underline}**. [The following areas would
be relatively unscathed]{.underline}, unless nuclear attacks were made
in these regions: [South and Central America, Africa, the Middle East,
the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Australasia, Oceania and large
parts of China]{.underline}. Even in the mid-latitudes of the northern
hemisphere where most of the nuclear weapons would be exploded, areas
upwind of nuclear attacks would remain free of heavy radioactive
contamination, such as Portugal, Ireland and British Columbia. [Many
people]{.underline}, perhaps especially in the peace movement, [believe
that global nuclear war will lead to the death of most or all of the
world's population]{.underline}. 12 z **[Yet]{.underline}** [the
available scientific evidence provides **no basis** for this
belief]{.underline}. Furthermore, [there seem to be **no convincing
scientific arguments** that nuclear war could cause human
extinction]{.underline}.13 In particular, the idea of
**['overkill']{.underline}** if taken to imply the capacity to kill
everyone on earth, [is highly misleading]{.underline}. 14 In the absence
of any positive evidence, [statements that nuclear war will lead to the
death of all or most people on earth should be considered
**exaggerations**]{.underline}. In most cases the exaggeration is
unintended, since people holding or stating a belief in nuclear
extinction are quite sincere.1 5 Another major point to be made in
relation to statements about nuclear war is that almost exclusive
attention has been focussed on the 'worst case' of a major global
nuclear war, as indeed has been done in the previous paragraphs. A major
global nuclear war is a possibility, but not the only one. In the case
of 'limited' nuclear war, anywhere from hundreds of people to many tens
of millions of people might die. 16 This is a real possibility, but
peace movement theory and practice have developed almost as if this
possibility does not exist.

### AT EU Defense Integration

#### NATO is key -- EU defense can't replace it

**Bergmann et al ' 21** (Max Bergmann, James Lamond, Siena Cicarelli.
Max Bergmann is the director of the Europe Program at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Prior to joining CSIS he was
a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. He has a master's
degree in comparative politics from the London School of Economics and
Political Science and a bachelor's degree in political science from
Bates College. "The Case for EU Defense: A New Way Forward for
Trans-Atlantic Security Relations." CAP. 6/1/21.
https://www.americanprogress.org/article/case-eu-defense/)

To be clear, EU defense will in no way replace or displace NATO. [**The
NATO alliance is the most successful military alliance in history**
because it forged an unbreakable bond across the Atlantic, uniting the
United States and Canada with Europe]{.underline}. Additionally, [there
are prominent European countries, such as Norway and the United Kingdom,
that are not members of the EU]{.underline}. **[EU
defense,]{.underline}** therefore, **[could never replace NATO's
critical role]{.underline}**. Instead, as this report argues, [the EU
could help strengthen the alliance by building a stronger European
pillar]{.underline}, creating a more unified, efficient, and capable
partner for the United States through NATO. [A major shift is
needed]{.underline} because the current problems plaguing European
defense are structural. [The problem with European defense is less about
spending and more about fragmentation]{.underline}. Each European
country has its own distinct national military, leading to incredible
inefficiencies and waste. **[NATO]{.underline}** [does its best to
coordinate the hodgepodge of European forces and]{.underline} **[plays a
vital role in focusing on clear gaps in capabilities, setting
priorities, establishing commitments, and coordinating
forces]{.underline}**. [NATO's role is crucial in stitching together 30
national military forces into a military alliance capable of acting
together.]{.underline} [But marginal spending increases dispersed among
individual states does not provide nearly the benefit in
security]{.underline} as it should. Strengthening European defense is
therefore not just about spending but also about addressing the
incessant fragmentation, duplication, and waste. Furthermore, [Europe is
transforming in ways that require NATO to adapt]{.underline}. In forming
a political union, Europeans not only banded together, ceding
significant sovereignty to the EU, but they also agreed to become EU
citizens. [Citizens of EU member states therefore became EU citizens as
well, gaining common rights, privileges, and protections]{.underline}.
As a result, [this has blurred the perception of responsibility for
defense and foreign policy between the EU in Brussels and the national
capitals]{.underline}. But while present U.S. policy has blocked the EU
from developing the hard-power tools to protect its EU citizens, [there
is consistent and overwhelming public support for greater EU involvement
in defense.]{.underline} Yet there is no similar support for greater
defense spending at the national level.

#### EU defense integration shouldn't replace NATO -- a mutual defense approach is best 

**Borrell '22** (Josep Borrell. "Europe in danger: what next for EU
security and defence?" - Speech by High Representative/Vice-President
Josep Borrell at the Bibliothèque Solvay." European Union. 1/25/22.
https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/%E2%80%9Ceurope-danger-what-next-eu-security-and-defence%E2%80%9D-speech-high-representativevice-president_en)

Let me stress that [NATO remains at the heart of Europe's territorial
defence]{.underline}. No one is questioning that. [But this should not
prevent European countries from developing their capabilities and
conducting operations in our neighbourhood and beyond]{.underline}.
[Greater European strategic responsibility is the best way to reinforce
transatlantic solidarity. It is not either EU or NATO: **it is
both/and.**]{.underline} Let me also add that [hesitations to move ahead
on this agenda "because of NATO" come from inside the EU, not the
US.]{.underline} They have repeatedly said, and I quote that the US
wants: "a stronger and more capable European defence that contributes to
global and Transatlantic security". The US essentially says: "Don't
talk, act. Please get on with it and help us share the security burden."
Naturally, [we must remain faithful to Europe's way of doing
security]{.underline}. We know that purely military responses are
inadequate. We have seen this time and again, in Afghanistan, the Sahel
and elsewhere. There are a lot of 'lessons to learn'. One thing is
clear: we need a comprehensive understanding of security and
locally-owned political settlements. This is why the [Compass puts a lot
of emphasis on our '**integrated' approach**, bringing civilian and
military instruments together, investing in cooperative and multilateral
solutions.]{.underline} That is our trademark and we must stick to
wherever we operate around the world.

#### NATO effectively deters Russia now -- Putin would have already used nukes 

### AT Global Security

#### Conditional defense alliances (like NATO) prevent conflict initiation

relations, Princeton University. Director, Center for Analysis of U.S.
Grand Strategy; Senior Political Scientist. " Do Alliances and
Partnerships Entangle the U.S. in Conflict." RAND Corporation. August
2021.
https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA700/RRA739-3/RAND_RRA739-3.pdf)

[One set of studies asked whether states that join defensive alliances
are more likely to initiate or escalate conflict than those with other
security relationships]{.underline} (e.g., neutrality pacts, offensive
alliances) or no alliances at all.35 All U.S. alliances are defensive in
the sense that they commit the United States to provide military support
only in the event of an attack on the ally. Multiple studies have found
that, on average, [states that have at least one defensive alliance are
less likely to initiate conflict than states without a defense
alliance]{.underline}.36 Once a dispute has begun, targeted states with
a defensive alliance are less likely to respond with the threat,
display, or use of force.37 In particular, **[defensive alliances with
conditional terms have the strongest association with lower rates of
conflict initiation]{.underline}**.38 This suggests that [the only type
of alliance agreement that the United States has---the conditional
defensive alliance]{.underline}---[is associated with less
conflict.]{.underline} Although these results do not definitively
demonstrate that the written terms of alliances are what causes less
conflict initiation, they do suggest that [there is something common
among states with conditional alliance relationships that induces less
conflictual behavior.]{.underline} Other factors, however, such as a
state's ambitions, also influence the relationship between alliance
commitments and conflict behavior. For example, there is little evidence
that even defensive conditional alliances change the behavior of
revisionist states---those with publicly stated ambitions for greater
territory or status.39 Revisionist states with conditional defensive
alliances still initiate conflict at higher rates than status quo
states, and there is no statistically significant difference in the
behavior of revisionist states with or without an alliance.40

### AT Ukraine/Russia War

#### Assistance from NATO is critical to Ukraine's success in the conflict 

**NATO '22** (North Atlantic Treaty Organization. "NATO\'s response to
Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine." 6/3/22. Statement by NATO Heads of State
and Government
<https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_192648.htm#:~:text=4.,humanitarian%20and%20non%2Dlethal%20aid>.)

[What are NATO and Allies doing to help Ukraine? NATO is helping to
coordinate Ukraine's requests for assistance and is supporting Allies in
the **delivery of humanitarian and non-lethal aid**. Individual NATO
member countries are sending weapons]{.underline}, [ammunition and many
types of light and heavy military equipment,]{.underline} [including
anti-tank and anti-air systems, howitzers and drones.]{.underline} To
date, [NATO Allies have provided and committed **billions of dollars of
military equipment** to Ukraine.]{.underline} [All of this is making a
difference on the battlefield every day, helping Ukraine to uphold its
right of self-defence]{.underline}, which is enshrined in the United
Nations Charter. Furthermore, [Allies are sending medical supplies and
other vital equipment to Ukraine,]{.underline} [including in such areas
as cyber security and protection against chemical, biological,
radiological and nuclear threats.]{.underline} [They are also providing
millions of euros of financial assistance to Ukraine]{.underline}. [Many
Allies are also providing humanitarian aid to civilians and hosting
millions of Ukrainian refugees.]{.underline} Allies are also supporting
efforts for international investigation of atrocities, including by
providing legal expertise to Ukraine. [NATO Allies have agreed to step
up and sustain their support for as long as necessary]{.underline}, so
that Ukraine can prevail.

#### NATO is key to prevent further escalation

**NATO '22** (North Atlantic Treaty Organization. "NATO\'s response to
Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine." 6/3/22. Statement by NATO Heads of State
and Government
<https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_192648.htm#:~:text=4.,humanitarian%20and%20non%2Dlethal%20aid>.)

[Why isn't NATO sending troops or closing the skies over Ukraine? NATO's
actions are]{.underline} defensive, [designed]{.underline} not to
provoke conflict but **[to prevent conflict]{.underline}**. [The
Alliance has a responsibility to **ensure that this war does not
escalate and spread beyond Ukraine**]{.underline}, which would be even
more devastating and dangerous. [Enforcing a no-fly zone would bring
NATO forces into direct conflict with Russia.]{.underline} [This would
significantly escalate the war]{.underline} and lead to more human
suffering and destruction for all countries involved. [What are NATO and
Allies doing to impose costs on Russia?]{.underline} [NATO Allies and
partners have imposed unprecedented costs on Russia, including **severe
sanctions** that are helping starve the Kremlin's war machine of
resources. Allies continue to refine the sanctions in order to increase
the pressure on Moscow]{.underline}. [These efforts will make it
**harder for Russia to rebuild its tanks, manufacture missiles and
finance its war. These sanctions have been effective**]{.underline}.
[The Russian economy is shrinking]{.underline}. Consumer prices have
risen. Many Western companies have pulled out of Russia, and many
Russian professionals have left. In a matter of weeks, President Putin
has destroyed decades of economic progress for the Russian people.
President Putin's decision to attack Ukraine is a terrible strategic
mistake, for which Russia will pay a heavy price, both economically and
politically, for years to come.

#### NATO's role in ending the conflict is indisputable 

**Merritt '22** (Giles Merritt - Founder and Secretary General of
Friends of Europe. He is also the Founder and Director of the Security &
Defence Agenda (SDA). He is one of the most influential commentators in
Brussels on EU issues. "Europe mustn\'t put all its eggs in the NATO
security basket." Friends of Europe. 5/24/22.
https://www.friendsofeurope.org/insights/europe-mustnt-put-all-its-eggs-in-the-nato-security-basket/)

[The eyes of the West are on NATO and its swift response to Russia's
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. But we should also focus our thinking
on the European Union, for only the EU and not the US-led military
alliance can be the basis of a peaceful long-term outcome to this
crisis. So far, the EU's political input has centred on sanctions to
dissuade Russia from continuing its war against Ukraine. Henceforth,
though, it must play a wider role. That was the message France's
President Emmanuel Macron strove to impart when he proposed a wider
European political framework open to non-EU members such as Ukraine and
the United Kingdom. **[NATO's importance is indisputable]{.underline}**.
[Although its ill-considered enlargement may very well have contributed
to the crisis by feeding Russia's 'encirclement' paranoia, **the
alliance now stands as the only credible deterrent of further
incursions**]{.underline}. However, US military strength can never be
key to a lasting peace settlement in Europe. Th[e US must back an
eventual ceasefire leading to peace discussions between Kyiv and
Moscow.]{.underline} But the greater burden of establishing a new
European order capable of reassuring Russians while punishing Putin will
fall on the EU's shoulders. [Washington's financial and material support
is crucial to Ukraine's gallant counter-attacks, but it also rules out
US leadership in whatever post-war reconciliation and re-balancing
process may emerge.]{.underline}

#### NATO continues to strengthen its deterrence and defense posture in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict

**NATO '22** ("Deterrence and Defense." North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. 3/28/22.
https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_133127.htm)

[NATO]{.underline} is a political and military alliance, whose principal
task is to ensure the protection of its citizens and to promote security
and stability in the North Atlantic area. The Alliance must be able to
address the full spectrum of current and future challenges and threats
from any direction, simultaneously. The Alliance [continues to
strengthen its deterrence and defence posture in light of the changed
and evolving security environment. Russia's aggression against Ukraine
poses the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in
decades]{.underline}, shattering peace in Europe and **[reinforcing the
need for NATO to ensure that its deterrence and defence posture is
credible and effective.]{.underline}** In response, [NATO has activated
its defence plans]{.underline}, [deployed elements of the NATO Response
Force and significantly increased the number of forces on its eastern
flank.]{.underline} On 24 March 2022, at an extraordinary summit about
Russia's war on Ukraine, [NATO leaders agreed to deploy four battalions
in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia]{.underline}, in addition to
the four already present in the Baltic States and Poland. More
generally, [they decided to take measures to ensure the security and
defence of all Allies across all domains]{.underline}, reinforcing the
Alliance's longer-term deterrence and defence posture. NATO continues to
face distinct threats and challenges emanating from all strategic
directions; from state and non-state actors; from military forces and
from terrorist, cyber and hybrid attacks. [Two military concepts set the
direction for NATO's ongoing evolution: the Concept for Deterrence and
Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area]{.underline} focuses on force
employment to deter and defend today, while [the NATO Warfighting
Capstone Concept offers a vision to guide the Alliance's long-term
warfare development]{.underline} to remain militarily strong now and in
the future At the Brussels Summit in 2021, [NATO leaders approved the
"NATO 2030" initiative]{.underline}, [which has led to the introduction
of additional measures to ensure NATO remains strong militarily, becomes
even stronger politically and adopts a more global approach to
security.]{.underline} [European Allies and Canada have made
considerable progress in increasing defence spending and investing in
major equipmen]{.underline}t, taking steps toward fairer burden-sharing

### NATO = RC Russia-Ukraine Conflict 

#### Putin's decision to launch war on Ukraine stemmed from his fear of NATO expansion

In his 2014 memoir, Duty, Robert M. Gates, who served as secretary of
defense in both Bush's administration and Barack Obama's, conceded that
"[trying to bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO was truly
overreaching]{.underline}." [That]{.underline} initiative, he concluded,
[was a case of "recklessly ignoring what the Russians considered their
own vital national interests."]{.underline} Indeed it was, and [Moscow
began to push back]{.underline}. Putin exploited a foolish provocation
by Georgia's pro‐​Western government to launch a military offensive that
penetrated deeply into the country. Upon its victory, [Russia
permanently detached two secessionist‐​minded Georgian regions and put
them under permanent Russian control.]{.underline} The Kremlin's
decisive action should have alerted even slow‐​learning U.S. leaders that
the days of Russian officials merely issuing verbal protests about the
West's steady encroachment into Russia's security sphere were over.
Amazingly, though, [the Obama administration still sought to turn
Ukraine into a NATO political and military asset. In late 2013 and early
2014, the United States and several European governments meddled
shamelessly to support the efforts of demonstrators to unseat Ukraine's
generally pro‐​Russia president, Victor Yanukovych, some two years before
the expiration of his term]{.underline}. That campaign was especially
inappropriate since Yanukovych became president in 2010 as the result of
an election that even the European Union and other international
observers acknowledged was reasonably free and fair. In a democratic
system, the legal way to remove a president from office is, depending on
a specific country's constitutional rules, through a parliamentary vote
of no‐​confidence, impeachment, or defeat in the next election. Angry
street demonstrations do not fit into any of those categories, yet the
United States and its allies backed that illegal process. A recording of
the infamous leaked telephone call between Assistant Secretary of State
Victoria Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt confirmed
the extent of Washington's meddling in the affairs of a sovereign
country. The Ukraine episode proved to be an intolerable provocation to
neighboring Russia. [Putin responded by annexing the strategic Crimea
peninsula and the United States and its NATO partners then imposed
economic sanctions on Russia.]{.underline} The new cold war was on in
earnest. Yet Washington still refused to back off. Instead, [the Trump
and Biden administrations poured weapons into Ukraine, approved joint
military exercises between U.S. and Ukrainian forces, and even prodded
the allies **to include Ukraine in NATO war games.**]{.underline} In
late 2021, it became clear that the Kremlin's restraint had run dry.
[Moscow issued demands for security guarantees, including a draw‐​down of
military forces already deployed in NATO's eastern members. With respect
to Ukraine, **the demand was very clear** and uncompromising: Not only
would Kyiv never receive a membership invitation, but NATO weapons and
troops would never be deployed on Ukrainian soil.]{.underline} [When the
West failed to provide those guarantees, Putin launched his devastating,
full‐​scale war.]{.underline} Moscow's cruel overreaction deserves
emphatic condemnation. However, [the culpability of the United States
and its NATO allies also is sizable]{.underline}. [Moving an alliance
that one great power dominates to the border of another major power is
inherently destabilizing and provocative.]{.underline} Those people who
are familiar with even the basics of international relations should
grasp that point; it was inexcusable that so many U.S. and NATO leaders
apparently did not do so.

#### NATO is at root of the Russia-Ukraine conflict

of Pennsylvania and received a master's degree in European politics at

[After the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, NATO expanded
eastward]{.underline}, [eventually taking in most of the European
nations that had been in the Communist sphere]{.underline}. [The Baltic
republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, once parts of the Soviet
Union, joined NATO, as did Poland, Romania and others.]{.underline} As a
result, [NATO moved hundreds of miles closer to Moscow]{.underline},
directly bordering Russia. And in 2008, [it stated that it planned ---
some day --- to enroll Ukraine]{.underline}, though that is still seen
as a far-off prospect. [Mr. Putin has described the Soviet
disintegration as one of the greatest catastrophes of the 20th
century]{.underline} that robbed Russia of its rightful place among the
world's great powers. He has spent his 22 years in power rebuilding
Russia's military and reasserting its geopolitical clout. **[The Russian
president calls NATO's expansion menacing, and the prospect of Ukraine
joining it a major threat]{.underline}**. As Russia has grown more
assertive and stronger militarily, his complaints about NATO have grown
more strident. He has repeatedly invoked the specter of American
ballistic missiles and combat forces in Ukraine, though U.S., Ukrainian
and NATO officials insist there are none. [Mr. Putin has also insisted
that Ukraine is fundamentally parts of Russia, culturally and
historically]{.underline}. [East-West relations worsened drastically in
early 2014, when mass protests in Ukraine forced out a president closely
allied with Mr. Putin. Russia swiftly invaded and annexed
Crimea]{.underline}, part of Ukraine. [Moscow also fomented a separatist
rebellion that took control of part of the Donbas region of
Ukraine,]{.underline} in a war that still grinds on, having killed more
than 13,000 people. Mr. Putin appears intent on winding back the clock
more than 30 years, establishing a broad, Russian-dominated security
zone resembling the power Moscow wielded in Soviet days. Now 69 years
old and possibly edging toward the twilight of his political career, he
clearly wants to draw Ukraine, a nation of 44 million people, back into
Russia's sphere of influence. [Russia presented NATO and the United
States in December with a set of written demands that it said were
needed to ensure its security]{.underline}. [Foremost among them are a
**guarantee that Ukraine would never join NATO,** that NATO draw down
its forces in the Eastern European countries that have already joined,
and that the 2015 cease-fire in Ukraine be implemented]{.underline} ---
though Moscow and Kyiv disagree sharply on what that would mean. [**The
West dismissed the main demands** out of hand.]{.underline} Moscow's
aggressive posture has also inflamed Ukrainian nationalism, with citizen
militias preparing for a drawn-out guerrilla campaign in the event of a
Russian occupation. The Russian leader may also want to energize
nationalists at home by focusing on an external threat, as he has in the
past. Nevertheless, since the invasion began, thousands of Russians,
some at great personal risk, have taken to the streets to protest the
war. In early December, [President Biden made clear that his
administration was not considering sending troops to fight for Ukraine
since, among other reasons, Ukraine is not a member of the NATO alliance
and does not come under its commitment to collective defense. Instead,
the United States has sent anti-tank and antiaircraft weapons to
Ukraine, increased the American military presence in NATO countries
bordering Russia, and ordered an additional 7,000 troops to
Europe]{.underline}. The Pentagon also ordered the deployment of an
armored brigade combat team to Germany to reassure skittish NATO allies
in Eastern Europe. Administration officials also warned that the United
States could throw its weight behind an Ukrainian insurgency.
